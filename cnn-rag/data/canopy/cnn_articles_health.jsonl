Despite living in the light-filled streets of central London, my smartphone camera picked up a green haze and a pulsing sheet of purple and pink light. Capturing the moment was an unforgettable experience and one that I had thought would involve expensive travel to the northernmost reaches of our planet. The storms that create spectacular auroras such as those I witnessed originate from the sun\u2019s dynamic magnetic field, an astrophysical enigma that scientists this week came closer to unraveling. Solar update Figuring out how the sun\u2019s magnetic field works will help scientists improve the forecasting of space weather, which dazzles night sky watchers but can disrupt GPS and communication satellites. The sun\u2019s looping magnetic field lines, which form a tangled web of structures more complex than those on Earth, are difficult to study directly. To grasp what\u2019s going on, scientists create mathematical models. A new model, which took more than a decade to develop and required a NASA supercomputer to conduct the detailed calculations, found that the sun\u2019s magnetic field is generated much closer to the surface than previously thought. The team believes its model is more accurate because it accounts for a unique solar feature. A long time ago A single gold earring found in the ruins of a 2,000-year-old building in the Pyrenees is a clue to how a devastating fire may have started. The inferno consumed the wooden structure, situated in an Iron Age settlement called Tossal de Baltarga, and killed six animals penned in a stable. Archaeologists believe the fire was deliberate. Had it been accidental, the building\u2019s owners likely would have released the livestock and returned after the fire died down to retrieve their hidden gold, which was concealed in a jar. The arsonists may have been an invading army under Hannibal, the Carthaginian general who led troops against the Roman Republic, according to the new study. The fates of the people who used the building are unknown, but the excavation uncovered telling details of the lives of an Iberian people called the Cerretani. Sky watch The builders of Stonehenge placed the huge stones that make up the prehistoric monument in line with sunrise and sunset on the longest and shortest days of the year, revealing an intimate understanding of the sun that\u2019s still palpable today. But does the 4,500-year-old site in southwest England \u2014 and potentially other megalithic monuments around the world \u2014 also align with the moon? The idea that Stonehenge has a lunar link first gained ground in the 1960s. However, the concept hadn\u2019t been systematically explored \u2014 until now. This summer, archaeologists are using the lunar standstill, a little-known phenomenon that happens every 18.6 years, to investigate. Across the universe Space scientists have observed the edge of a black hole \u2014 an area known as the \u201cplunging region\u201d \u2014 for the first time. Andrew Mummery, lead author of a new study on black holes and a research fellow at the University of Oxford, compared it to \u201cthe edge of a waterfall\u201d at the end of a river, where orbiting material from nearby stars plummets into the abyss. In the plunging region, matter can no longer stay in orbit and instead hurtles into the black hole. But unlike at the black hole\u2019s event horizon, or surface, light can still escape at this point. The study\u2019s findings, which Albert Einstein predicted, could help astronomers better understand the formation and evolution of black holes.

Researchers working with Eurasian jays trained to find food hidden under cups said these birds may be capable of the feat of memory. In the experiment, which involved decorated cups, the jays were able to remember what a particular cup looked like, even after the cups were rearranged and a time delay.

{"id": "2024_06_19_health_low-back-pain-walking-wellness", "text": "Low back pain affects at least 619 million people worldwide, and that number is expected to increase to 843 million people by 2050, according to research estimates. Unfortunately, nearly 70% of people who recover from an episode of low back pain have a recurrence within a year, experts say. In addition to acute physical discomfort and lost time at work, treatment often requires education, physical therapy and exercises such as Pilates that may require fees or specialized equipment. Yet there is an easy, free way to prevent low back pain, at least for a while, according to a new randomized clinical trial. People in the study who walked regularly after having at least one episode of low back pain were pain free nearly twice as long as those who did not. \u201cThe intervention group had fewer occurrences of activity-limiting pain compared to the control group, and a longer average period before they had a recurrence, with a median of 208 days compared to 112 days,\u201d said senior author Mark Hancock, a professor of physiotherapy at Macquarie University in Sydney. \u201cWalking is a low-cost, widely accessible and simple exercise that almost anyone can engage in, regardless of geographic location, age or socio-economic status,\u201d Hancock said in a statement. Walking for at least 30 minutes The study, published Wednesday in The Lancet journal, followed 701 Australian adults, mostly women in their 50s, who had recently recovered from an episode of low back pain that derailed their ability to perform daily activities. Each person was randomly assigned to a control group with no intervention or an individualized walking and educational program. Those in the intervention group were asked to build up to 30 minutes of walking five times a week over a six-month period at speeds adjusted for age, physical capacity and individual preferences. Jogging was also allowed. \u201cAfter three months, most of the people who took part were walking three to five days a week for an average of 130 minutes in total,\u201d Hancock told CNN via email. Participants were asked to wear pedometers to track their daily steps and keep a walking diary. At three months into the program, they also wore an accelerometer that objectively measured daily step count and the amount of brisk walking or other physical activity. The program also provided six physiotherapist-guided education sessions over six months, a more cost-effective model than typical treatment, Hancock said. \u201cWe included 3 standard sessions with a physiotherapist and 3 brief phone catch ups,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cIn the few previous studies of prevention exercise programs for back pain the intervention included approximately 20 group classes. \u201cWe also discussed simple strategies to reduce the risk of a recurrence of low back pain and instructions on how to self-manage any minor recurrences. The education was embedded in the same sessions as the walking prescription.\u201d Cost-effective intervention In addition to providing participants with longer pain-free periods, the walking program reduced the amount of time taken off work and medical visits by half, said lead study author\u00a0Natasha Pocovi, a postdoctoral fellow at Macquarie. \u201cThe exercise-based interventions to prevent back pain that have been explored previously are typically group-based and need close clinical supervision and expensive equipment, so they are much less accessible to the majority of patients,\u201d Pocovi said in a statement. \u201cOur study has shown that this effective and accessible means of exercise has the potential to be successfully implemented at a much larger scale than other forms of exercise.\u201d Due to the structure of the study, it was not possible to determine how much of the benefit was due to walking or the educational program provided by physiotherapists, Hancock said. \u201cWe believe it is likely the two components complement each other, with education helping to overcome avoidance and fear of movement, while the health coaching and walking program resulted in behavior change,\u201d he said. However, because the intervention appeared to be behavioral coaching, and not actual physical therapy, the act of walking may indeed have been the key reason for improvement, said A. Lynn Millar, a retired physical therapist\u00a0and former professor at Winston-Salem State University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. She was not involved in the study. \u201cThis is important, as many studies have shown that pain response is partially a behavioral response,\u201d Millar said in an email. \u201cThe coaching was limited in duration, thus they can suggest that the primary intervention of walking was the major contributor to the long term response.\u201d What walking does for the body What is it about walking that is so helpful for lower back pain? For one, exercise is good for every part of the body. \u201cFirst, the person is sitting less, and sitting is not the best posture for the back,\u201d Millar said. \u201cSecond, walking will improve general circulation,\u00a0and will improve blood circulation to the\u00a0muscles of the back that\u00a0are\u00a0actively supporting the individual during the motion. Movement of a joint also helps circulate the\u00a0joint fluids,\u00a0thus the\u00a0joints of the\u00a0spine may be benefiting from the motion.\u201d Walking improves metabolism and the amount of calories burned, experts say. Lower weight can ease the load on the back and legs, ensuring better spinal health. Taking a brisk stroll also improves the strength of core muscles around the spine and in the legs, all of which can improve posture and provide better support to the spine. Walking also increases muscle endurance, assuring muscles are less susceptible to fatigue and injury. Weight-bearing exercises such as walking increase bone density, protecting against injury while stimulating the release of endorphins, the body\u2019s natural feel-good hormones that reduce pain and stress. When starting a walking program, good shoes and arch supports are necessary,\u00a0and potential problems may be offset by exercise programs such as resistance training and stretching, Millar said. \u201cI also think it is important to have varied paces and distances throughout the week. Some problems are caused by progressing too rapidly, and not paying attention to initial\u00a0aches,\u201d she said. \u201cI also used to see people that were walking in shoes that did not have good support, or they had become so worn, the support was gone,\u201d she added. If your \u201cback goes out\u201d during walking, activity modification such as cycling or swimming may be necessary, Millar said.\u00a0 Taking a day or two off from walking and doing some back exercises and stretching can also help.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/health/low-back-pain-walking-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_health_cdc-dengue-warning-for-the-us", "text": "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a warning\u00a0to doctors on Tuesday to be on the look out for cases of dengue. A surge in dengue cases globally is raising the risk that people could catch the disease in the US. The number of people who develop the mosquito-borne disease has been increasing globally as the world\u2019s climate warms due to the human-made climate crisis. The infected mosquitos that spread the disease, the Aedes aegypti, and sometimes\u00a0Aedes albopictus, mosquitoes like warmer and wetter weather. Generally, dengue had been relatively rare in the continental US with most people getting sick after having traveled to popular destinations overseas where the disease is more common. So far this year, a higher-than-expected number of dengue cases have been identified among US travelers, with 745 cases in records kept through June 24, the CDC said. In 2023, 1,829 travel-associated cases were reported by US travelers, the highest number of travel-associated cases since dengue became reportable in the US in 2010, according to the CDC.  Twenty-three countries reported outbreaks last year with more than 5 million cases reported to the World Health Organization and 4,000 deaths in the Americas alone. Over the years there have been a handful of outbreaks in locally-transmitted cases in states with warmer climates and habitat friendly to the kind of mosquito that spread dengue like Florida, Texas, Hawaii and Arizona. California reported its first locally transmitted case in Pasadena last year. Tuesday\u2019s warning from the CDC says that the number of global infections in 2024 have been the highest on record. Cases in the Americas have already exceeded the highest number ever recorded in a single year,\u00a0with more than 9.7 million people getting sick with dengue; that\u2019s twice as many cases in all of 2023. So many people have gotten sick with dengue in Puerto Rico, local public health officials declared a public health emergency. Other areas with frequent dengue transmission associated with the US include American Samoa, the US Virgin Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Marshall Islands and the Republic of Palau. The CDC warning instructs doctors to test patients with symptoms that look like dengue, especially those patients who have traveled to a part of the world where the disease is more common. Symptoms typically start about a week after the person has been bitten by the infected mosquito, although 40 to 80% of infections are asymptomatic, according to the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA). Symptoms of dengue can include a fever, vomiting, muscle aches, joint and bone pain, pain behind the eyes, headache, nausea, low white blood cell counts and a fever. Most people recover after about a week. The CDC said warning signs that the dengue is progressing to a more serious form of the disease include persistent vomiting, fluid accumulation, bleeding from the nose or gums, liver enlargement, being tired and abdominal pain. Severe disease can bring with it severe bleeding, respiratory distress, and a person\u2019s organs can start shutting down and people can die. Mortality can be as high as 13% in untreated patients, the IDSA said. Infants, pregnant people and the elderly are at an increased risk for severe dengue, along with people who have certain underlying medical conditions. Other than supportive care including treatment with fluids and rest, there are no specific medicines to treat dengue. There is no dengue vaccine recommended for travelers or for adults. There was a vaccine, Dengvaxia, but Sanofi Pasteur stopped making it citing a lack of demand. The public health departments in Puerto Rico will still be giving the shots to children aged 9 to 16 years with a lab-confirmed case who live in areas with frequent transmission until the doses expire in 2026. In April of this year the CDC had launched an emergency response that addresses the increasing dengue caseload in the US. It also expanded lab capacity and is working with local leaders to strengthen surveillance for the disease. To prevent dengue, use bug spray when outside, particularly when traveling to parts of the world where dengue is common. Wear loose-fitting and long-sleeved shirts and pants. Run the air conditioning or use window screens so mosquitos stay outside.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/health/cdc-dengue-warning-for-the-us/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_health_bird-flu-risk-opinion-frieden", "text": "Editor\u2019s note: Tom Frieden, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2009 to 2017, is president and chief executive of\u00a0Resolve to Save Lives\u00a0and senior fellow for global health at the\u00a0Council on Foreign Relations. The United States\u2019 response to H5N1 \u2013 \u201cbird flu\u201d \u2013 has taken too long, showing how risky gaps in coordination and trust can be. With three cases reported in people in the United States and clusters in cattle herds from Michigan to Texas, Idaho to North Carolina, it\u2019s clear that the virus is widespread among animals. To protect people, animals, and our economy and to restore trust in public health, we need to get this right. We\u2019ve seen H5N1 coming for more than 20 years. Although the challenge was smaller because of it size, Finland stopped H5N1 in animals before it spread to humans last summer. This story, among a half dozen outbreaks that never made headlines, is featured in our new\u00a0Epidemics That Didn\u2019t Happen\u00a0report. The U.S. has done a lot, including scaling up test production, evaluating vaccines, tracking wastewater for related viruses, and providing information about efforts. Finland did three things particularly well; all are relevant to the U.S. response to the virus. Rapid response.\u00a0Within 24 hours of the first cases being reported on a mink farm, Finland confirmed that the animals tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, which was known to be circulating among birds in Finland, just at the virus has been circulating among birds in the U.S. for the past two years. Human and animal health specialists worked together immediately to track infections, including testing at-risk workers on farms with infected animals. In the United States, H5N1 has been spreading among cattle since at least late last year. Even today, the United States doesn\u2019t know the extent of spread among animals or humans due to insufficient testing and tracking. The\u00a07-1-7 target for outbreak detection\u00a0and response should be our guiding principle: seven days to detect a suspected infectious disease outbreak, one day to notify public health authorities, and seven days to complete the initial response. This approach can halt outbreaks before they spread. Finland\u2019s response met this target. In the U.S., instead of 7 days, the time from emergence of H5N1 in cattle to detection was more like 100 days, and it\u2019s not clear we\u2019ve met the 7-day target for initial response even months into the outbreak. Doing so requires communication and public health measures in the affected communities and an effective coordination mechanism. We must improve the connection of human and animal health and strengthen animal public health. Trust.\u00a0Farmers already had a high level of trust in the Finnish Food Authority after years of successful programs, and had launched a surveillance program that resulted in rapid notification of unusual symptoms among their animals.\u00a0Farmers were immediately reimbursed for the value of animals that needed to be culled to stop disease spread, strengthening trust of the government in the farming community. This trust will no doubt help Finland\u2019s\u00a0next move: vaccinating frontline workers against H5N1. They are the first country to do so. Trust toward the United States government is low, especially among rural Americans who are on the front line of these outbreaks.\u00a0In May, the US Department of Agriculture announced\u00a0payments to farms\u00a0to help stem spread in dairy cattle, including\u00a0covering veterinary expenses for cattle testing positive for H5N1,\u00a0compensating farms that\u00a0supply personal protective equipment to their workers, and paying farm workers to participate in USDA and CDC studies.\u00a0We may need to do more to protect our nation\u2019s agricultural sector. Coordinated government response.\u00a0Human health and agriculture officials in Finland coordinated closely, paving the way for a rapid, effective response. The joint response strengthened detection, collaboration of industry groups, and protection of workers from infection. Finland rapidly passed new legislation to ensure it had the authority to implement effective control measures. In the United States, government agencies have had rocky relationships given varying priorities, legal authorities, agility and politics. There are multiple agencies involved: USDA monitors cattle health, US Food and Drug Administration monitors milk safety and the CDC monitors diseases in humans, including from animal exposure. Coordination seems to be improving, but any directives from the government should be crafted to the specific needs of each community; national mandates will likely not be practical given our country\u2019s size and diversity. We have a lot to learn, and no time to lose.\u00a0First, localities,\u00a0states and national authorities must work with one another. This will require multiple federal agencies \u2013 including CDC, USDA, FDA \u2013 and their state counterparts to share information transparently and in real time with each other and with the public.\u00a0Second,\u00a0Congress needs to provide resources to prevent and respond to pandemic risks, including for systems, workforce, and infrastructure so we\u2019re prepared to stop new events before they become epidemics. Third and perhaps most importantly, we must quickly build relationships with farm owners and workers by being responsive to their needs and addressing their questions and concerns. If one country responds to H5N1 well, that\u2019s not enough. Microbes know no borders. Every country \u2013 including the United States \u2013 needs an effective response.

{"id": "2024_06_16_health_eid-al-adha-holiday-mindfulness", "text": "While holidays are often marked by parties, shared meals, gift-giving and special outfits, experts say there\u2019s health benefits to remembering the meaning behind the celebration. The three-day holiday of Eid-al-Adha commemorates the story in the Quran of God appearing to Ibrahim, or Abraham, in a dream and commanding him to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience. The holiday, which starts on Sunday this year, is determined by the lunar calendar, and Saudi Arabia announces the dates according to its time zone. Muslims believe that as Abraham was about to sacrifice his son, an angel of God stopped him and gave him a ram to sacrifice in place of his son. A version of the story also appears in both Christian and Jewish scriptures. Many people kick off the holiday by calling and texting Muslims they know throughout the world with \u201cEid Mubarak,\u201d which means blessed feast or festival. Families typically attend a special morning prayer at the local mosque and then gather with loved ones to feast over a holiday meal and exchange money or gifts. Others may make a obligatory pilgrimage to Mecca \u2014 the Hajj pilgrimage \u2014 to visit the holiest sites in Islam, including the mountainous region where Abraham\u2019s feted act took place. Muslims also honor Abraham\u2019s sacrifice with udhiya or qurbani \u2014 sacrificing a cow, sheep or goat and then sharing the meat with friends and family and offering it to those in need. Many people also send donations to or place qurbani orders in Muslim countries to feed disadvantaged people. These traditions are reminders that letting go, having faith and doing good deeds will be rewarded, said Dr. Yasmine Saad, a clinical psychologist and author in New York City. This message and the pious and social acts of Eid, such as celebrating with friends and family and spreading acts of charity exemplify mindfulness and can be helpful when implemented regularly. \u201cEid is a reminder that we should strive to add more of this balance in our day-to-day,\u201d said Dr. Rania Awaad, clinical professor of psychiatry and director of the Stanford Muslim Mental Health & Islamic Psychology lab. Here are some mindful takeaways from the Eid holiday that you can include in your routine \u2013 no matter what you believe in. At its core, mindfulness is staying in the present, focusing on one\u2019s thoughts, feelings and surroundings without judgment. The practice of mindfulness carries multiple health and wellness benefits such as decreasing pain, reducing stress and easing feelings of depression. Stay hopeful and look for silver linings The story of Abraham is not easily transferable to everyday life as it was an example of an extreme hurdle, but the lesson of pushing through a hardship and carrying on with resilience is relatable.\u00a0 \u201cIslam really develops this notion of faithfulness and patience in the face of a trial,\u201d said Dr. Gabriel Reynolds, professor of Islamic Studies and Theology at University of Notre Dame. In Islamic spirituality, this mindset \u201cbecomes a real important way for Muslims to carry on through trials, suffering, oppression, evil that they suffer in life.\u201d Reynolds describes this mindset as a \u201csustaining force\u201d for Muslims. And it\u2019s not limited to Islam \u2014 anyone can reflect on one\u2019s current circumstances and look for positivity as a way to get through the hard parts. Do your part and trust the process During Abraham\u2019s challenging ordeal, his wife was also being tested. According to Islamic narrative, she was left alone in the desert in present-day Mecca with their son so that Abraham could follow God\u2019s command. In this story, the baby was in desperate need of nourishment, so the mother ran between two hills seven times to try to procure water for the baby. Eventually water \u2014 of which the well has become the source of holy water for Muslims \u2014 sprung up from the ground where the baby\u2019s feet lay. It sounds like a miraculous happening, but when applied to daily life, one can view it as doing one\u2019s work and trusting that things fall into place. Abraham\u2019s wife did her part by trying her best to search for nourishment for her child. Feeding others \u2018feeds the soul\u2019 Muslims commemorate the day with the sacrifice of an animal, and they take it a step further by making a meal of it for their own families and for people less fortunate. In this way they venerate Abraham while underscoring sharing and giving. At the root of qurbani is creating a shared experience while giving to others. \u201cA lot of people are feeling purposeless, and they feel that what they do in their life doesn\u2019t hit home,\u201d Saad said. \u201cGiving to others, giving to poor (people), sharing, making an impact in other people\u2019s lives always feeds the soul.\u201d You can make cooking for others, volunteering at a soup kitchen and donating your money, time or goods a regular \u2014 but impactful \u2014 part of your routine. Giving can \u201crealign people so their mind will be different, they will think more positive thoughts, their bodies will feel better, they will have a smile on their face,\u201d Saad said. By stepping out of one\u2019s routine and giving to others, it can help make \u201cyou feel you have an impact, you help, you have significance.\u201d This sense of purpose and meaning contributes to living a happier and longer life, according to an expert. In a larger sense, kindness contributes to one\u2019s sense of community and belonging, and donating to others has proven to reduce blood pressure and improve heart health, according to studies. It takes a village Humans are inherently social creatures, and loneliness and social isolationa are not good for one\u2019s brain, body or spirit, according to research. Even the size of a person\u2019s social network can impact health. Smaller networks are linked to larger feelings of isolation and loneliness, which can impact disease and death rates. Further, more positive experiences in social relationships is generally linked to better coping and lower stress. Because Eid is celebrated over a period of three days, the holiday emphasizes socializing and connecting with others for longer than just an afternoon or a day. These kinds of \u201csocial ceremonies\u201d can be helpful, said Dr. David Spiegel, psychiatrist and director of the Center on Stress and Health at Stanford Medicine. People have survived because \u201cwe\u2019ve formed communities, and support one another, and protect one another,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving a community act that gives you a sense of doing something and doing something together with other people does help people to manage stress better.\u201d Connecting with one\u2019s community and expanding that circle, or even in smaller ways such as making time for a friend can be healthy. Fill your cup While going on the Hajj pilgrimage might be spiritually fulfilling for some Muslims, it may not be practical for everyone to take that journey. But creating space that brings in any sort of fulfillment can usher in new, exciting energy. Whether it\u2019s reading a good book or going on a yoga retreat for example, it can be something you do for your growth and gratification. Even a hike can do it for some, Awaad explained. \u201cIt could be something that just fills your cup to where you\u2019re able to then ground yourself and be much more attuned to the people around you and to the work that you\u2019re doing.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/health/eid-al-adha-holiday-mindfulness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_health_depression-types-brain-treatments-study-wellness", "text": "For some people with depression, finding the right medication can be a process of trial and error lasting for months or even years, which can worsen symptoms. But what if doctors, when diagnosing someone with depression, could assess exactly how depression is affecting a patient\u2019s brain and prescribe a treatment that gets it right the first time? Scientists may be a step closer to that reality, thanks to new research that has identified six subtypes \u2014 or \u201cbiotypes\u201d \u2014 of major depression via brain imaging combined with machine learning. The study, published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, also tested how three of those biotypes responded to different antidepressants and therapies. \u201cThere are currently no tests available to help pinpoint what type of depression (people) have, or, I think especially importantly, what treatment might be most suitable for them,\u201d said Dr. Leanne Williams, the study\u2019s senior author and the Vincent V.C. Woo Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Stanford University School of Medicine in California. \u201cThe current situation is we rely on a person to tell us what they\u2019re experiencing and for the physician or therapist to observe symptoms and come to a diagnosis.\u201d About 280 million people worldwide and 26 million people in the United States have depression, which is a leading cause of disability. Some 30% to 40% of people with depression do not experience symptom improvement after trying one treatment, according to the study. And about 30% of people diagnosed with depression go on to experience treatment-resistant depression when the disorder doesn\u2019t improve after multiple treatment attempts. \u201cThat motivated this study \u2014 to have a whole new way to more quickly get the right treatment, to figure out the right treatment for each person the first time,\u201d said Williams, who is also the director of the Stanford Center for Precision Mental Health and Wellness. Williams lost her partner to a decades-long struggle with depression in 2015 and for more than 20 years has focused her work on individualized mental health care.\u00a0 Mapping depression in the brain The authors used data from 801 adult participants who were previously diagnosed with depression or anxiety, and 137 healthy control group participants. The authors used functional MRI \u2014 magnetic resonance imaging \u2014 to measure participants\u2019 brain activity when they were at rest doing nothing, focusing on brain regions already known to play a role in depression, and on the connections between those regions. They also monitored brain activity when participants, who were in their mid-30s on average, engaged in various tests that evaluated their cognitive and emotional functioning. The authors also randomly assigned 250 of the participants to receive behavioral talk therapy or one of three commonly used antidepressants: venlafaxine, escitalopram or sertraline. The six biotypes of depression the authors found include one characterized by hyperactivity in cognitive regions, which was associated with more anxiety, negative bias, threat dysregulation and anhedonia than other biotypes. Threat dysregulation refers to how people manage their reactions to their fears, such as social interactions, Williams said. Anhedonia is the lack of interest in or enjoyment of life experiences. Participants with this biotype also performed worse on executive function tasks that assessed how well they could manage thoughts or behaviors, make decisions or suppress distraction, Williams said. They also had the best response to the antidepressant venlafaxine. Another biotype was marked by higher levels of brain connectivity in three regions associated with depression and problem-solving. Those with this biotype also made errors in executive function tests but did do well on cognitive tasks. They found their symptoms better alleviated by behavioral talk therapy, which teaches skills for better addressing daily problems. The higher connectivity in these brain regions might be what helped participants with that biotype more readily adopt new skills, study coauthor Dr. Jun Ma said in a news release. There was also a biotype distinguished by lower levels of activity in the brain circuit that manages attention. This biotype was linked with more mistakes on tasks requiring sustained attention, and less of a chance of improving with therapy. People with this biotype may need medication for the dysfunction first so they can gain more from therapy, said Ma, the Beth and George Vitoux Professor of Medicine at the University of Illinois Chicago. The authors also found a biotype characterized by high emotional reactivity, meaning the brains of participants in this group were more affected by emotional inputs such as their own emotions or people\u2019s facial expressions, Williams said. One other biotype was associated with lower activity in cognitive brain regions and less connectivity in emotional regions, meaning these participants had difficulty responding to cognitive information and regulating negative emotions. Those last two biotypes didn\u2019t respond to the medications or therapy, which suggests other options may be needed for people with those types, Williams said. \u201cIn other studies, we\u2019re finding they respond to some of the newer treatments being developed.\u201d The sixth biotype identified didn\u2019t differ from brain scans of the same region in people without depression. Williams said she thinks this finding could mean the full range of brain biology underlying depression hasn\u2019t been entirely discovered. \u201cDepression is a lot of different things with a lot of different causes, biological changes and treatments,\u201d said Dr. Richard Keefe, professor emeritus of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University Medical Center in North Carolina, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. The study \u201ctakes a positive step in the direction\u201d of figuring these things out, Keefe added via email. Hurdles and next steps The study, though \u201csophisticated and very well done,\u201d does have several key problems, including the low number of people enrolled in treatment, said Dr. Jonathan Alpert, the Dorothy and Marty Silverman Chair of the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City. \u201cIt needs to be thought of as a very preliminary study that needs to be replicated.\u201d Additionally, more diverse samples are needed, said Alpert, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study and is a professor of psychiatry, neuroscience and pediatrics at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Most participants were White, and 2% were Black. But the most important next step is a study that tests the authors\u2019 hypothesis \u2014 that if patients have particular biotypes, they\u2019ll do better on a specific treatment \u2014 and tracks participants over time, said Alpert, chair of the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Council on Research. The 250 treatment participants weren\u2019t randomized on the basis of their biotypes. So, what Alpert recommends the authors do next is assign people to treatments based on their biotypes and see whether those participants have better outcomes from that method than if they had been assigned to a treatment according to clinical judgment without knowledge of their biotype. Another issue is that the study investigated only one form of psychotherapy and three medications; in the real world, there are many of each, Alpert said. The medications were also all serotonin-based, but there are a few other classes of antidepressants. Studies can only do so much at a time, Alpert acknowledged, but addressing these shortcomings incrementally would help continue advancements toward precision psychiatry. What these findings mean for you The study\u2019s methods and findings are years away from being applied to direct patient care, experts said, but there is funding for such efforts. \u201cSince 2009, the National Institute of Mental Health has been invested in using basic science, including functional brain imaging like in this study, for identifying the causes of mental illness through approaches that delve deeper than the traditional diagnostic approaches,\u201d Keefe said. This month, Williams was awarded an $18.8 million grant as part of the National Institutes of Health\u2019s Individually Measured Phenotypes to Advance Computational Translation in Mental Health Initiative. The grant supports a five-year project involving 4,500 participants, which is centered on the development of a better diagnosis and treatment tool for depression biotypes. The new study\u2019s approach has begun to be experimentally implemented at a Stanford clinic, Williams said. \u201cWhen we use it in that setting, we can effectively double the chance of someone getting better,\u201d she said, taking the odds from around 30% of people improving with the traditional approach to about 75% with the more precise method. This method isn\u2019t intended to replace or be the primary choice for assessments of individual cases of depression, Williams said. It\u2019s another piece that can be added to the puzzle that also includes symptom information, clinical interviews and more. For now, people with depression should know \u201cthere is continued progress being made\u201d toward efficiently getting patients effective treatment, Alpert said. If you\u2019re struggling, talk with a mental health professional about your options. One powerful effect these findings could have immediately is to reduce stigma, Williams said. For people who think their depression is just due to them \u201cnot trying hard enough,\u201d she added, understanding the disorder through the lens of objective measures of brain function could be \u201cdeeply helpful.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/health/depression-types-brain-treatments-study-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_22_health_hiking-heat-safety-wellness", "text": "With summer officially here, many people are excited to go hiking along their favorite local trails or tackle an out-of-town bucket-list hike. But before you grab your backpack and race out the door, hiking and safety officials urge caution. Temperatures are already soaring in many parts of the nation and around the world, and high heat has the potential to make any hike risky \u2014 and even deadly. Earlier in June, a young couple was rescued on a hiking trail in the California desert after running out of water and becoming dehydrated. The boyfriend was conscious during the rescue, but the girlfriend appeared unconscious, and medical officials referred to her \u201csevere condition,\u201d according to KTLA in Los Angeles. Others have not been as fortunate. Last year, a 14-year-old boy died while hiking with two family members in Texas\u2019 Big Bend National Park. The temperature was 119 degrees Fahrenheit (48 degrees Celsius). In 2021, a couple, their 1-year-old child and their dog all died in California while hiking in Devil\u2019s Gulch Valley on an extremely hot day. Experts said they likely perished from hyperthermia (an abnormally high body temperature) and dehydration. In Phoenix, where more than 200 hikers are rescued every year \u2014 mostly due to hiking during the hottest part of the day \u2014 the city instituted a program to close certain trails when the heat reaches excessive levels. How to tackle hiking in the heat Despite these heat-related dangers, it\u2019s possible to hit the trails safely when temperatures soar. Here\u2019s how to do so, according to experts. Prepare for a hot hike ahead of time Whether it\u2019s hot or cool, you should be in reasonable shape before tackling any hike. If you\u2019re planning a hilly, 5-mile trek, for example, make sure you\u2019re able to hike 5 challenging miles before arriving at the trailhead. To prepare for heat, become acclimatized to hot weather. You can do so by taking short, easy hikes in warm weather, progressing up to longer, more difficult hikes in hot weather. If that\u2019s not possible and you\u2019re traveling to a hot locale for your hike, schedule the trek several days into the trip when your body will be more accustomed to the weather. It\u2019s also good to know your sweat rate, said Dr. Floris Wardenaar, an assistant professor of nutrition\u00a0at Arizona State University in Phoenix. Wardenaar, who studies the physiological aspect of hiking, recommended weighing yourself before and after several hikes, then comparing any weight loss with the amount of water you consumed during the hike. \u201cBody mass loss is a good proxy marker of sweat loss,\u201d Wardenaar said. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t lose more than 2% of your body weight on a hike.\u201d If you\u2019re losing more weight than that, you should be drinking more fluids. Load up on water and carry a water filter Water is essential for any hike, no matter the season \u2014 but it\u2019s critical in hot weather. Unfortunately, many people underestimate the amount of water they\u2019ll need. \u201cAlways hike with a water treatment device, too, and carry electrolytes,\u201d Martinez said. Electrolyte tablets or drinks help replace the salts and minerals lost through sweat, which assists in preventing heat-related ailments such as heatstroke and heat exhaustion. \u201cBring extra water, even if it\u2019s heavy,\u201d said Teresa Ana Martinez, executive director and cofounder of the Continental Divide Trail Coalition. The Continental Divide Trail stretches 3,100 miles (4,989 kilometers) from Mexico to Canada, including some 800 miles (1,287.5\u00a0kilometers) in New Mexico, where there\u2019s plenty of desert terrain. Hike in the morning, preferably on shady trails \u201cThe benefit of hiking earlier in the day versus later in the evening is that in the evening, the earth still holds heat from the day,\u201d Wardenaar said. \u201cIt will radiate from the rocks, too.\u201d If possible, select a trail that winds through shady woods, along water or even in a cool canyon or cave. This way, should you struggle with the heat, you can find shade and water for cooling off. Wear light, loose clothing that covers most of your skin A long-sleeve shirt and pants might seem counterintuitive on a hot day, but they\u2019ll prevent sunburn and stop your skin and body from heating up. A neck buff and hiking gloves are also a good idea, said Abe Christian, operations manager for the Florida Trail Association. The Florida Trail meanders more than 1,200 miles (1,931 kilometers) through the state, from Big Cypress Swamp on the southern tip of the peninsula to Fort Pickens in the panhandle. \u201cThere are plenty of places on the Florida Trail where the sun can beat you to death,\u201d Christian said. \u201cSo you need to cover your skin as best as possible.\u201d The buff can also double as a compress should the heat get to you. Just dip it in water and place on your head and neck. Take along a sun umbrella, phone \u2014 and a buddy Make sure you have a fully charged phone in case you need to call for help. A portable battery is helpful, too. Martinez swears by a sun umbrella, which keeps the sun\u2019s rays from heating your head. (Look for those with an ultraviolent protection factor, or UPF, label or a seal of recommendation from groups such as the Skin Cancer Foundation.) If possible, bring along a friend. Sometimes when you\u2019re experiencing dehydration, heat exhaustion or heatstroke, you\u2019re not thinking clearly and don\u2019t realize you\u2019re in danger. When in doubt, turn around \u201cIf you start your hike and think it\u2019s too hot, it\u2019s too hot,\u201d Martinez said. Just turn around and come back another day, she said. Another tip: Turn around when half of your water is gone, even if you haven\u2019t reached your goal. \u201cYour ego is your worst enemy,\u201d Martinez warned. \u201cPeople underestimate how quickly things can escalate. You don\u2019t know when your body will say, \u2018I\u2019ve had enough.\u2019\u201d Melanie Radzicki McManus is a freelance writer who specializes in hiking, travel and fitness.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/health/hiking-heat-safety-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_health_fda-menthol-vapes-response", "text": "Four menthol vaping products were authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration on Friday, the first non-tobacco-flavored e-cigarette products to get the agency\u2019s sign-off. The decision drew harsh criticism from pediatricians and anti-tobacco groups, which called it \u201ca blow to public health\u201d and warned of potential for \u201cdisastrous consequences\u201d to children. The products, made by NJOY, an Altria company, are disposable e-cigarettes and nonrefillable pods that are used with the company\u2019s reusable vaping device. Nicotine levels in the products range from 2.4% to 6%. The company did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Friday\u2019s authorizations do \u201cnot mean these tobacco products are safe nor are they \u2018FDA approved,\u2019\u201d the agency said, but evidence submitted by the company showed that the products could be beneficial to adult smokers to help them make a switch from traditional cigarettes to e-cigarettes. The agency said there was sufficient evidence that the products would be \u201cappropriate for the protection of public health.\u201d \u201cBased upon our rigorous scientific review, in this instance, the strength of evidence of benefits to adult smokers from completely switching to a less harmful product was sufficient to outweigh the risks to youth,\u201d Dr. Matthew Farrelly, director of the Office of Science in the FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products, said in a news release. E-cigarettes were created to be a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes and were advertised by tobacco companies as a way to help people quit smoking, with flavored vapes being most popular. Massive advertising campaigns targeted children, helping lead to a vaping epidemic among young people \u2014 and eventually an FDA crackdown on flavors. Still, many flavored products remain available for purchase while the agency reviews marketing applications. An FDA official told the US Senate Judiciary Committee last week that regulation of e-cigarettes was a \u201ctop priority.\u201d However, the agency missed a September 2021 deadline to complete its review of e-cigarette makers\u2019 applications to sell their products; a federal court had ruled that the FDA was violating the Tobacco Control Act by allowing e-cigarette products that did not have agency pre-authorization to stay on the market. The FDA has been making its way through 27 million applications from companies seeking marketing authorization for e-cigarette products. Only 27 have gotten the FDA\u2019s green light, and until now, tobacco was the only flavor to do so. Anti-tobacco groups and doctors were quick to criticize Friday\u2019s decision as short-sighted and risky, especially for young people. \u201cToday\u2019s decision is hard to understand in light of the FDA\u2019s own repeated conclusions that flavored e-cigarettes, including menthol-flavored products, appeal to kids and have fueled the youth e-cigarette epidemic. What has changed?\u201d Yolonda C. Richardson, president and CEO of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said in an email. \u201cThis decision is especially troubling given the FDA\u2019s failure to do its job and clear the market of unauthorized, illegal e-cigarette products. Rather than authorizing the sale of flavored e-cigarettes, the FDA should be stepping up its enforcement efforts against the illegal products that are addicting our kids.\u201d The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network said in an email that the FDA decision had \u201cdealt a blow to public health,\u201d even as the Biden White House continues to hold up a long-awaited ban on menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars. \u201cOn the heels of the administration refusing to finalize rules to prohibit menthol in cigarettes and all flavors in cigars, this decision is a missed opportunity for the FDA to do the right thing,\u201d said Lisa Lacasse, president of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. \u201cBy authorizing the sale of menthol flavored e-cigarettes, including two disposable menthol e-cigarettes, the agency is continuing to allow Big Tobacco to addict yet another generation of youth to their products. Authorizing the sale of any flavored e-cigarette flies in the face of public health and fails to protect young people from a lifetime of addiction.\u201d The American Academy of Pediatrics said it is also \u201cprofoundly disappointed\u201d by the FDA decision. \u201cPrevious decisions by FDA to allow the marketing of flavored e-cigarettes had disastrous consequences for children that we are still working to overcome,\u201d President Dr. Benjamin Hoffman said. \u201cThese products will inevitably end up in the backpacks of middle schoolers. Once that happens, FDA will have an obligation to immediately reverse this deeply unwise decision.\u201d Erika Sward, assistant vice president of nationwide advocacy for the American Lung Association, said it \u201copposes any flavored products being on the market. But what is most troubling is the fact that these are so highly addictive with 5% and 6% nicotine. And that is a recipe for more addiction, particularly among kids.\u201d \u201cMenthol-flavored e-cigarettes are highly attractive to kids. And this is a one-two combination of a flavor plus such high levels of nicotine, and that\u2019s a recipe for disaster,\u201d Sward said. About 10% of high school-age adolescents and nearly 5% of middle school students use e-cigarettes,\u00a0according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Over the past five years, there has been a 60% decline in the number of middle and high school students using e-cigarettes, according to the FDA. But when they do vape, teens and young adults are much more likely to use flavored e-cigarettes than adults. According to the to the 2023 National Youth Tobacco Survey, more than 23% of high school e-cigarette users nationwide use menthol-flavored products. The FDA said it has put \u201cstringent marketing restrictions\u201d on the newly authorized products in an effort to prevent youth access and exposure. The agency also said it will closely monitor how the products are marketed, and if the company fails to comply with regulatory requirements, the agency may suspend or withdraw authorization. \u201cAll tobacco products are harmful and potentially addictive,\u201d the FDA said. \u201cThose who do not use tobacco products shouldn\u2019t start.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/health/fda-menthol-vapes-response/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_entertainment_teen-emotions-inside-out-wellness", "text": "There is so much going on inside a teenage brain that Disney\u2019s Pixar subsidiary made a whole movie about it. \u201cInside Out 2\u201d follows the main character, Riley, as she turns 13 and experiences all the emotional changes that come with puberty: more sensitivity, awareness of her place in her social circle, and a lot of anxiety. In early teen years, the brain is going through a remodeling, said Dr. Lisa Damour, a clinical psychologist in Ohio who consulted on the new animated film. Along with those renovations come new, nuanced emotions \u2014 embarrassment, envy, ennui and anxiety. Adults can often bemoan the challenges of raising a teenager, but research has shown that if you expect the worst, you will get it, said Dr. Laurence Steinberg, professor of psychology and neuroscience at Temple University in Philadelphia. And having more positive expectations can predict a better relationship with your teen. Damour said she hopes that the movie can give visual understanding to what is going on in the adolescent period and that more understanding can bring closer relationships. Teens feel more complex feelings more deeply Once puberty has started, the characters that make up Riley\u2019s emotions find that pressing any buttons gets a bigger reaction. And psychologically, that makes sense. \u201cOne of the main features of emotional development in adolescence is this easy arousability of both positive and negative emotions,\u201d Steinberg said. Their feelings are stronger than those of either children or adults. And in adolescence, the brain has developed more of a capacity for abstract thought, bringing with it more complex emotions, said Damour, author of \u201cThe Emotional Lives of Teenagers: Raising Connected, Capable, and Compassionate Adolescents.\u201d They have more anxiety because they can more easily imagine future problems. They become more embarrassed because they better understand what others may be thinking of them. They become envious because they can see comparisons better between themselves and others, she added. And ennui isn\u2019t just a funny side effect. Acting like they don\u2019t care is often an important escape hatch for teens in a social conundrum, Damour said. \u201cThese are sophisticated emotions that require neurological development to come on the scene,\u201d she said. Eye rolls and sarcasm are part of growing up When looking at the islands in\u00a0Riley\u2019s\u00a0brain that represent different parts of her personality, the friend island has grown big and exciting, while the one for family has gotten smaller and retreated a bit. This moment in the movie should be both a comfort and a lesson for families \u2014 adolescents may shift their focus to friends, and that is both natural and helpful. \u201cThe job of teenagers is to become increasingly independent,\u201d Damour said. They may not yet be ready to be independent physically, so they practice by forming psychological independence, she added. \u201cTo put it another way, it would be very strange if teenagers continued to be as close to their parents and share every single thing with their parents, and then suddenly, one day, they say, \u2018OK, now I\u2019m moving out,\u2019\u201d Damour said. When they were toddlers, they learned they are individuals who can say they don\u2019t like broccoli. As teens, they are learning that they are entitled to express their opinions \u2014 and that the adults in their lives aren\u2019t always right, Steinberg said. \u201cThe reason they\u2019re doing that is that they\u2019re saying, \u2018I\u2019m a person who has their own style and ways of being,\u2019\u201d he added. But the attempt at independence can go wrong when parents or guardians take an eye roll or a sarcastic comment as a rejection, she said. Instead, Damour recommends trying to avoid escalating the situation with retaliation and anger. \u201cIt\u2019s often better for the parents to recognize that this is the normal course of events unfolding and just try to be neutral and say something like, \u2018You know what? That\u2019s rude,\u2019\u201d she added. Still, no one is going to get their response right every time, Damour said. Teens are figuring out who they are going to be If you ask children who they are, they will tell you concrete things such as the sports they play or where they live, said Steinberg, author of \u201cYou and Your Adolescent, New and Revised Edition: The Essential Guide for Ages 10-25.\u201d If you ask an adolescent, you will get a more complex answer with nuanced personality traits, he added. This understanding of complexity brings benefits and challenges, he said. \u201cWe want people to reflect on who they are and where they\u2019re going. We want them to have sophisticated understanding of themselves and other people,\u201d Steinberg said. \u201cThis is one of the things that makes teenagers vulnerable to mental health problems, because if you have the capacity to reflect on who you are, then you have the capacity to understand not only your strengths but your weaknesses as well.\u201d As they develop a sense of self, teens begin to assess their value, Damour said. Often self-confidence plummets in teenagers who do not evaluate themselves highly. \u201cThey feel that unless they are flawless, they\u2019re worthless,\u201d she added. Social media, academics and sports give teens so many opportunities to compare themselves with peers. So their aim \u2014 with the help of the adults in their lives \u2014 should be to learn how to recognize their shortcomings while still seeing themselves as valuable, Damour said. Teens are more prone to anxiety People can experience anxiety at any age, but teens are particularly vulnerable. Teen brains are more sensitive to social situations and primed to prioritize their place in the group, Steinberg said. \u201cWhen coming into a new social situation, it makes sense that people might experience more anxiety about it during this period of development than either before or after,\u201d he added. But that feeling of anxiety isn\u2019t inherently bad, Damour said. \u201cAnxiety is valuable for teenagers if it does things like help them to get going on a test they have not studied for,\u201d she said. \u201cAnxiety is there to help us course correct, to help us anticipate problems or threats.\u201d Things get out of control in the movie when anxiety is running the ship, and the visual representation of that emotion run amok offers an important lesson for teens, Damour said. \u201cOne of the ways that we define irrational anxiety is that you overestimate the threats and underestimate your ability to deal with them,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re helping people manage anxiety clinically, we\u2019re not actually trying to get rid of their anxiety. We\u2019re trying to get it down to the right level.\u201d Your kids still need your support What do you do to help your teen through these big psychological transitions? Do not throw your hands up and try to be their best friend when they start to push for independence, Steinberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually important that we hold them to high standards for how they treat people,\u201d Damour said. \u201cBut it is materially different if parents can remember that adolescence is not something that teenagers do to adults, but it\u2019s a complex developmental phase that they are working their way through.\u201d Keep the warmth and connection with a child while holding firm to your boundaries, Steinberg said. And trade the \u201cbecause I said so\u201d with more conversations, he added. It is also important to open up conversations around feelings \u2014 letting your teen know that they aren\u2019t wrong to feel deeply, but that you are attentive and ready to help them work through these feelings, Steinberg said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that a parent should ever say something like, \u2018Well, don\u2019t let things bother you\u2019 or \u2018The amount of upset that you\u2019re expressing is out of proportion with what happened,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be dismissive.\u201d Caregivers may feel an urge to protect children from the painful experiences that come with growing up, but we need to demonstrate that uncomfortable feelings are important and valuable, Damour said. Feelings are abstract, which can make them hard to discuss. Damour said she hopes entertainment and media that normalize emotions and give them visual representation can provide families with a jumping-off point. Because often, just reaching out to teens and helping them identify their feelings is a good way to address problems, she added. \u201cAs soon as you talk about a feeling, it comes down to size,\u201d Damour said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be able to fix the problem. You do need to be able to talk about it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/entertainment/teen-emotions-inside-out-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_health_alzheimers-dementia-ornish-lifestyle-wellness", "text": "Looking back, Tammy Maida, 67, said things started to change in her late 50s. At first, she would lose track of her belongings: her keys multiple times a day, a ring, eyeglasses, her purse. She would drive to the grocery store in her hometown of San Jose, California, and forget where she parked the car. At home, she couldn\u2019t remember where she had put the groceries. Her husband, Paul, would sometimes find them in the garage. A lifelong, avid reader, Maida stopped picking up books because she couldn\u2019t remember the last chapter she had read or the major characters. \u201cI honestly thought I was losing my mind, and the fear of losing my mind was frightening,\u201d she told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta for the CNN documentary \u201cThe Last Alzheimer\u2019s Patient.\u201d Today, Maida is back to devouring short novels and helping with the family finances. Another patient, Mike Carver, 71, was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s at age 64 while working as a business executive. Doctors told him to put his affairs in order with little hope for the future. Carver eventually learned that he was a carrier of both copies of the\u00a0APOE4 gene, which carries the highest-known genetic risk for Alzheimer\u2019s. Now, however, Carver is back to reconciling the family finances and keeping track of investments. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like doing a happy dance,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cIt was kind of hard saying that part of me was just gone. And so a lot of self-worth has come back.\u201d How did Maida and Carver gain back what dementia had stolen from them? By participating in what researchers call the first randomized controlled clinical trial to use lifestyle interventions and show cognitive improvement in people with mild cognitive impairment or early dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u2018A study to give us hope\u2019 The study, published Friday in the journal Alzheimer\u2019s Research and Therapy, was small, with only two dozen people receiving treatment and a similar number serving as controls over a short, five-month period. Not everyone showed improvement. Still, for some participants and their families, there were remarkable changes. The thinking skills of a majority of people in the intervention group stayed the same, a boon since most in the control group declined. Ten people saw their cognition actually improve, while a blood test found levels of amyloid, a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, were retreating, said lead study author Dr. Dean Ornish, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cThis is a study to give us hope,\u201d said journalist and former California first lady Maria Shriver, founder of the Women\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s Movement at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, which provided early seed funding for the new research. \u201cThis study finally gives us scientific data to support what many of us in this field have believed instinctively for years, that lifestyle interventions may determine the trajectory of people\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s journeys,\u201d Shriver said in a statement. Because the clinical trial was only five months long, the results were \u201castounding,\u201d said co-senior study author Rudy Tanzi, an Alzheimer\u2019s researcher and professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School in Boston. \u201cIf you picture a brain full of damage as a sink full of water, when you just turn off the tap, it takes a long time for that sink to slowly drain, right?\u201d said Tanzi, director of the McCance Center for Brain Health at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. \u201cIf you want the amyloid to go down in 20 weeks, as we found on one blood test, you\u2019re going to need a Roto-Rooter.\u201d That\u2019s exactly what the study did \u2014 provide people with a carefully constructed, multipart, intensive lifestyle intervention that targets multiple contributors to cognitive decline. And those who put in the most effort saw the best results. \u201cThere was a statistically significant dose-response relationship between the degree of adherence to our lifestyle changes and the degree of improvement we saw on measures of cognition,\u201d said Ornish, creator of the Ornish diet and lifestyle medicine program, founder and president of the nonprofit Preventive Medicine Research Institute and coauthor of \u201cUndo It!: How Simple Lifestyle Changes Can Reverse Most Chronic Diseases.\u201d \u201cI would describe this as a really positive, small pilot study, a starting point for additional research,\u201d said Dr. Suzanne Schindler, an associate professor of neurology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. \u201cI wish we could do a program like this for everyone, not just people with mild cognitive impairment or early stage Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d said Schindler, who was not involved in the study. \u2018Eat well, move more, stress less and love more\u2019 The lifestyle intervention Ornish created \u2014 \u201ceat well, move more, stress less and love more\u201d \u2014 has been tested before. In 1990, Ornish showed for the first time in a randomized clinical trial\u00a0that coronary artery disease could often be reversed with nothing more than diet, exercise, stress reduction and social support. Since then, research has shown the same four-part program can\u00a0lower blood sugars\u00a0and heart disease risk in\u00a0patients with diabetes, reduce\u00a0prostate cancer\u00a0cell growth,\u00a0improve depression and reduce \u201cbad cholesterol.\u201d \u201cHow is it that these same four lifestyle changes stop, and often reverse, the progression of such a wide spectrum of the most common and costly chronic diseases?\u201d Ornish asked. \u201cIt\u2019s because they all share many of the same underlying biological mechanisms: chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, changes in the microbiome, changes in gene expression, changes in immune function and so on,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the lifestyle choices we make every day \u2014 what we eat, how we respond to stress, how much exercise we get, how much love and social support we have \u2014 can activate or downregulate these different mechanisms.\u201d Taking care of the heart and the brain Since what\u2019s good for the heart is good for the brain, Ornish asked, why couldn\u2019t this intervention also work on early Alzheimer\u2019s or other forms of dementia? \u201cIf we found patients didn\u2019t improve at all, that would be disappointing but an important finding \u2014 people need to know that,\u201d Ornish said. \u201cBut if we found that we could slow, stop or even reverse the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, that would be an important finding as well.\u201d To find out, Ornish and professors from other leading academic centers began recruiting patients into a new study. Covid-19 hit, which stalled progress until the team realized it could offer the intervention via video conference calls. \u201cThat was a game changer because before you had to live near a hospital or clinic that we trained in our program, and most people don\u2019t,\u201d Ornish said. \u201cNow you can live anywhere, even a food desert or rural area.\u201d Fifty-one people were selected for the study, then randomized into two groups: One group would consume a vegan diet, do daily aerobic exercise, practice stress reduction and engage in online support groups for 20 weeks, while the control group would not. A nutritionist held hour-long video classes on diet, while a therapist led equally lengthy group sessions three times a week in which participants shared their feelings and received support. Each day a fitness instructor led online strength training exercises and encouraged 30-minute daily walks. Meditation, deep breathing, yoga and other ways to reduce stress took up another hour every day. The program also encouraged participants to prioritize good quality sleep. Supplements were provided to everyone in the intervention group. They took a daily multivitamin, omega-3 fatty acids with curcumin, coenzyme Q10, vitamin C and B12, magnesium, a probiotic and Lion\u2019s mane mushroom (Hericium erinaceus). To be sure the vegan diet was followed, all meals and snacks for both the participant and spouse were delivered to their homes. Calories were unrestricted, but protein and total fat were about 18% of the daily caloric intake \u2014 experts say the average American eats twice the amount of protein they need and obtains 36% of daily calories from total fat. Complex carbs found in whole grains, vegetables, fruits, tofu, nuts and seeds made up most of the diet. Sugar, alcohol and refined carbs found in processed and ultraprocessed foods were taboo. \u201cA minimally processed diet is key,\u201d said Tanzi, who tests potential treatments for dementia on tiny organoids composed of human brain cells that develop signs of Alzheimer\u2019s. \u201cThe gut microbiome loves all the fiber from the whole grains, fruits and vegetables,\u201d Tanzi said. \u201cMy lab has shown in animals that a happy gut can trigger metabolites to the brain, which induce microglial cells to eat more of the amyloid in the brain.\u201d Microglial cells are the brain\u2019s housekeepers, responsible for tidying up synapses, taking out cellular trash and gobbling up nasties such as amyloid. They do most of their work at night during key stages of sleep. But when neurons die due to injury, age or a disease such as Alzheimer\u2019s, microglia become sidetracked, turning into killers to fend off whatever seems to be damaging the brain, Tanzi said. Doing so can unleash a cytokine storm, ramping up inflammation and causing further brain injury. Lifestyle changes can help microglia get back on track, Tanzi said. Besides a high-fiber diet, aerobic exercise and plenty of good quality sleep also encourage microglial cells and other amyloid-clearing enzymes to do their jobs. \u201cExercise and sleep induce clearance of amyloid in different ways than the gut microbiome,\u201d Tanzi said. \u201cCombining them is a powerful tool.\u201d In fact, microbiome tests of the study participants found two of the organisms that increase the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s went down in the intervention group and up in the control group, Ornish said. \u201cAt the same time, microorganisms believed to be protective against Alzheimer\u2019s went up in the intervention group and down in the control group,\u201d he added. Improvement for some but not all Five months into the program, the rest of the results were in. For some, such as Mike Carver and Tammy Maida, the program was life-changing. In addition to an improvement in his cognition, Carver and his wife, Pat, lost weight and reduced their cholesterol numbers and resting heart rates. Mike\u2019s\u00a0PSA levels, a test for prostate cancer,\u00a0looked better than ever before. Maida is sleeping better and back to accomplishing the tasks she thought she had to give up due to Alzheimer\u2019s: doing laundry, cooking, voraciously reading books, keeping track of household finances and small business bookkeeping. \u201cThe cloud of the Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis slowly started to lift,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Gupta. \u201cHonestly, I am more me than I had been for the years prior to starting Dr. Ornish\u2019s program.\u201d However, not everyone in the intervention improved. Two people dropped out \u2014 one couldn\u2019t give up McDonald\u2019s on the way home from his daily walks. \u201cIt was only a 20-week intervention period with a small sample size of just 24 people,\u201d said John Morris, distinguished professor of neurology and codirector of the Knight Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center at Washington University School of Medicine. \u201cOnly 10 out of 24 people in the intervention group seemed to improve and that meant 14 did not,\u201d said Morris, who was not involved in the study. \u201cOverall, it\u2019s interesting, but it would need to be a larger study, with a more representative sample and a longer treatment period to draw any definite conclusions.\u201d  For people who did the intervention, a blood test called plasma A\u03b242/40 showed an \u201cextremely\u201d significant improvement, the study found. The test measures the level of amyloid in the blood, a sign that the microglia in the brain are doing their job. Tests that measure amyloid in different ways did not show improvement, however. \u201cUnfortunately, not all the biomarkers were showing consistent effects,\u201d said Washington University\u2019s Schindler, who specializes in blood biomarkers. There was no significant change in a test for amyloid called p-tau 181, considered to be a superior measure of Alzheimer\u2019s risk, Schindler said. Nor was there any change in glial fibrillary acidic protein, or GFAP, another blood biomarker that seems to correlate reasonably well with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u201cIf one of these markers improves, you typically see all of them improve, so the fact they did not makes me wonder whether this effect is real,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they were to repeat the study with a much larger population for a longer period of time, perhaps more change could be seen.\u201d Need for empowerment One of the earliest patients recruited to the study was Cici Zerbe, now in her mid-80s. Six years ago, a neurologist diagnosed her with mild cognitive impairment and dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s. She knew what that meant. \u201cMy grandmother, she would sit forever and just twiddle her thumbs and stare into space and wouldn\u2019t talk too much,\u201d Zerbe told Gupta, who tracked her progress for five years in the documentary. \u201cHer mother, they finally put her in a home because her father couldn\u2019t take care of her,\u201d said Zerbe\u2019s husband, John. \u201cMy greatest fear was she would end up like her mother and grandmother, where I couldn\u2019t take care of her.\u201d A lifelong runner, retired educator and matriarch of a large family, Zerbe joined Ornish\u2019s study in 2019. Nearly five years later, Zerbe and her husband, who live in Novato, California, are still doing the program, and believe the intervention has turned her life around. \u201cIt\u2019s really helped. I think it\u2019s slowed it down,\u201d her daughter Alicia Manzoni told Gupta. \u201cI think she\u2019s doing very well,\u201d her husband added. \u201cI was afraid by this time she would be in a home or something.\u201d After all, it\u2019s the improvement in daily life, not blood or cognitive tests, that is most meaningful to a person with Alzheimer\u2019s and their family, said Washington University\u2019s Morris. \u201cWhat matters to the patient in the family is whether they\u2019re able to do the things they normally do,\u201d Morris said. \u201cIf they couldn\u2019t read and now, they can read, that\u2019s great. That\u2019s an outstanding achievement.\u201d For Ornish, who has watched members of his family die from Alzheimer\u2019s, the study\u2019s results are important for one key reason \u2014 hope. \u201cSo often when people get a diagnosis of dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s, they are told by their doctors that there is no future, \u2018It\u2019s only going to get worse, get your affairs in order.\u2019 That\u2019s horrible news and is almost self-fulfilling,\u201d Ornish said. \u201cI\u2019m not about false hope, and I\u2019m not saying that everyone will get better,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m here to empower people with the knowledge that if you do change, there is a reasonably good chance that you may slow the progression of the disease and often improve it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/health/alzheimers-dementia-ornish-lifestyle-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_health_children-sleep-issues-bedtime-anxiety-wellness", "text": "When her daughter was 6 years old, Kelceymarie Warner began to notice her child\u2019s hesitation before bedtime. \u201cHer body would be a little more tense, and she would hyperventilate if you pushed the subject too soon, she really needed to be slowly moved into the cycle.\u201d Warner, who is a parent to four young daughters, believes that sticking to a nightly routine is the best way for her kids to have an easy transition to bedtime. But when her 6-year-old was experiencing bedtime anxiety, Warner had to make some additions to her routine. Warner is not the only one \u2014 many parents know all too well what can be a nightly struggle to get their young children to bed. A new C.S. Mott Children\u2019s Hospital National Poll on Children\u2019s Health reinforces this common difficulty, revealing that 1 in 4 parents said their child has trouble getting to sleep because they are anxious or worried. Over one-third of parents reported that their child doesn\u2019t stay asleep throughout the night and often or occasionally wakes up upset or crying. \u201cFrom 1 year of age to 6 years of age, kids change a lot. The different phases that they go to are often pretty predictable: They\u2019re scared of the dark, or as kids develop and their imagination develops \u2026 now they\u2019re scared of monsters,\u201d said Sarah Clark, Mott poll co-director and a research scientist in pediatrics at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. \u201cIt can be all sorts of things, and so often with kids, and I would argue adults too, some of those anxieties seem to come out at night.\u201d The Mott Poll was conducted in February with 781 parents who have at least one child age 1 to 6 years old. Almost half reported their child leaving their bed and moving to the parent\u2019s bed some or most nights, while 1 in 3 parents said their child often or occasionally insists that they stay in the room until the child falls asleep. But some of these habits may be causing more trouble than the temporary relief they provide, Clark said. While a child may feel safe knowing the parent is in the room, they could later wake up and not be able to go back to sleep on their own, she added. How to help an anxious child with bedtime Warner said her child\u2019s bedtime anxiety may have been caused by the major changes that happened when her youngest daughter was in the neonatal intensive care unit for three months. \u201cMy husband and I were gone for extended periods during the day and even during the night because we wanted to be with a new baby who was born three months early \u2014 but we also needed to be there with our other children. I think she really struggled with a major change in her routine, and it just kind of triggered this very difficult time for her especially.\u201d Warner began incorporating activities into her daughter\u2019s bedtime routine that would promote relaxation and reassurance, such as drinking herbal tea after bathtime, reading a story together and saying nightly affirmations like \u201cI am loved\u201d and \u201cI am important.\u201d The new routine took longer than usual, sometimes up to an hour, but now, a little over a year later, her daughter is able to go through some parts of the routine on her own, and is able to better self-soothe, Warner said. She had posted her advice for other parents that may be facing a similar scenario\u00a0on her TikTok\u00a0account in 2023. The most important factor in getting kids to bed is consistency and sticking with a bedtime routine, Mott Poll co-director Clark said. Ninety percent of polled parents reported having an established and consistent bedtime routine. But some 27% described getting their child to bed was difficult, and those parents were more likely to not have a bedtime routine, stay in the room until the child fell asleep and keep the television or a video on. \u201cWe know that young children really resonate with consistency and routine, and getting ready for bed helps their body and their brain know that this is the time to start winding down,\u201d said Dr. Lauren Hartstein, an assistant professor in the department of psychiatry at the University of Arizona. She studies sleep and circadian health in early childhood and was not involved in the Mott poll. Hartstein recommends limiting media use at night, especially avoiding exciting content that could stimulate the child\u2019s brain and make it harder to wind down. A\u00a0January 2022 study\u00a0that Hartstein led found that children around this age group were more sensitive to light at night than adults are, and it could interfere with a child\u2019s production of natural melatonin, a hormone that regulates the sleep-wake cycle. Parents could find it beneficial to dim the lights an hour before bed, which would trigger a mental cue that it\u2019s time to get ready to sleep soon, she added. As for staying in the child\u2019s bedroom until they fall asleep, Clark recommends leaving the room and returning to check in every few minutes, which lets the child know that someone will be making sure they are safe every so often, but not staying in the room indefinitely. It\u2019s common for young children to experience sleep issues, especially as preschool-age children begin to reduce or drop naptime, Hartstein said. If parents are especially worried or see their child struggling during the day because they are sleepy, they should talk with their pediatrician, she added. Giving melatonin to young children The poll also found 1 in 5 parents often or sometimes give their child melatonin before bedtime, which came as a surprise given the younger age range of 1 to 6 years old, Clark said. \u201cClearly, this is something that people are feeling the need to try with younger kids. So, I think it\u2019s kind of a signal of how disruptive sleep problems can be for the whole family.\u201d It isn\u2019t recommended to give melatonin to children younger than age of 3, since many sleep issues with children that age are behavioral, according to\u00a0Boston Children\u2019s Hospital.\u00a0If a parent is considering giving melatonin to their child, they should speak with their pediatrician first, Hartstein said. \u201c(One) concern is that what you\u2019re teaching them is that if they can\u2019t sleep, they should just take a medication, at a time when they should really be developing these healthy sleep habits that will carry them through childhood,\u201d she added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/health/children-sleep-issues-bedtime-anxiety-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_health_microplastics-human-penises-study-scli-intl-scn-wellness", "text": "Scientists have found microplastics in human penises for the first time, as concerns over the tiny particles\u2019 proliferation and potential health effects mount. Seven different kinds of microplastics were found in four out of five samples of penis tissue taken from five different men as part of a study published in IJIR: Your Sexual Medicine Journal on Wednesday. Microplastics are polymer fragments that can range from less than 0.2 inch (5 millimeters) down to 1/25,000th of an inch (1 micrometer). Anything smaller is a nanoplastic that must be measured in billionths of a meter. They form when larger plastics break down,\u00a0either by chemically degrading or physically wearing down into smaller pieces. Some minuscule particles can invade individual cells and tissues in major organs, experts say, and evidence is mounting that they are increasingly present in our bodies. Study lead author Ranjith Ramasamy, an expert in reproductive urology who conducted the research while working at the University of Miami, told CNN that he used a previous study that found evidence of microplastics in the human heart as a basis for his research. Ramasamy said he wasn\u2019t surprised to find microplastics in the penis, as it is a \u201cvery vascular organ,\u201d like the heart. The samples were taken from study participants who had been diagnosed with erectile dysfunction (ED) and were in the hospital to undergo surgery for penile implants to treat the condition at the University of Miami between August and September 2023. The samples were then analyzed using chemical imaging, which revealed that four of the five men had microplastics in their penile tissue. Seven different types of microplastics were detected, with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP) the most prevalent, according to the study.  Now their presence has been confirmed, more research is needed to investigate potential links to conditions such as ED, Ramasamy said. \u201cWe need to identify whether microplastics are linked to ED and if there is a level beyond which it causes pathology and what types of microplastics are pathologic,\u201d he said. As for the wider implications of the findings, Ramasamy said he hoped the study would \u201ccreate more awareness about the presence of foreign bodies within human organs and foster more research surrounding this topic.\u201d Prior research has found that one liter of bottled water \u2014 the equivalent of two standard-size bottled waters \u2014 contained an average of 240,000 plastic particles. \u201cI think we need to be mindful about consuming water and food from plastic bottles and containers and try and limit the use until more research is done to identify levels that could cause pathology,\u201d Ramasamy said. Toxicologist Matthew J. Campen told CNN that this is \u201can interesting study that confirms the ubiquity of plastics in the body.\u201d \u201cAs we are trying to understand the potential health effects of plastics, this is another concerning paper,\u201d said Campen,\u00a0a regents\u2019 professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research. \u201cPlastics are generally non-reactive with the cells and chemicals of our bodies, but they could be physically disruptive to the many processes our bodies undertake for normal function, including functions related to erection and sperm production.\u201d Campen coauthored a study published in May that found that human testicles contain microplastics and nanoplastics at levels three times higher than animal testes and human placentas. The study tested 23 preserved testes from cadavers of males who were ages 16 to 88 at the time of their death, then compared the levels of 12 different types of plastics in those testicles with plastics found in 47 dog testes. \u201cThe levels of microplastic shards and types of plastics in human testes were three times greater than those found in dogs, and the dogs are eating off the floor,\u201d Campen said at the time the study was published. \u201cSo it really puts in perspective of what we\u2019re putting in our own bodies.\u201d There are steps you can take to reduce your exposure to microplastics. \u201cOne is to reduce our plastic footprint by using stainless steel and glass containers, when possible,\u201d said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, director\u00a0of environmental pediatrics at NYU Langone Health, in a\u00a0prior interview with CNN. \u201cAvoid microwaving food or beverages in plastic, including infant formula and pumped human milk, and don\u2019t put plastic in the dishwasher, because the heat can cause chemicals to leach out,\u201d said Trasande, who is also the lead author for the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 policy statement on\u00a0food additives and children\u2019s health.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/health/microplastics-human-penises-study-scli-intl-scn-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_health_aspirin-heart-older-adults-recommendations-wellness", "text": "Some seniors across the United States continue to take a daily aspirin in the hopes of reducing their cardiovascular disease risk, even though the practice is only recommended for certain high-risk patients \u2014 and taking it without a doctor\u2019s recommendation can come with significant risks. Cardiovascular diseases affect the heart and blood vessels and sometimes can lead to heart attacks or strokes. Most heart attacks and strokes occur when a blockage in the arteries, caused by plaque buildup, stops blood from traveling to the heart muscle or the brain \u2014 but here\u2019s where aspirin comes in. Aspirin helps thin the blood, which can prevent these blood clots from forming. That is why it had long been recommended to take a daily low-dose aspirin to reduce your risk. However, because aspirin thins the blood, it comes with the risk of excessive bleeding. In recent years, the medical and scientific communities have realized that the risk of aspirin may outweigh the benefits for many patients, especially older adults and adults already taking statins or other medications. The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association updated their guidelines in 2019 to say that \u201caspirin should be used infrequently in the routine primary prevention\u201d of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease because of lack of net benefit. Primary prevention refers to patients who have no history of cardiovascular disease, heart attack or stroke and are taking aspirin to prevent a first case. The US Preventive Services Task Force\u2019s final recommendations on aspirin use, issued in 2022, came after years of recommending aspirin to prevent heart attack and stroke. The USPSTF \u2014 a group of independent experts that makes recommendations to help guide doctors\u2019 decisions and their recommendations also influence insurance companies\u2019 reimbursement decisions \u2014 now recommends against adults 60 or older starting to take a low-dose aspirin for the prevention of a first cardiovascular disease event. It\u2019s recommended that adults ages 40 to 59 who have a 10% or greater risk of developing the disease in the next decade make individual decisions on whether to start taking a low-dose aspirin regularly. Yet several doctors say that despite the risks, some of their patients continue to follow the outdated guidance and take a daily low-dose aspirin when it\u2019s not recommended. The latest research on the prevalence of aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease suggests that in 2021, nearly a third of adults 60 or older without cardiovascular disease were still using aspirin. The study, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, includes data on more than 180,000 people from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Health Interview Survey. An analysis of the data found that about 19% of surveyed adults 40 or older reported taking aspirin for the primary prevention of the disease. Among adults 60 or older, nearly 30% reported taking aspirin to prevent cardiovascular disease, and around 5% of all adults 60 or older reported using aspirin without medical advice. \u201cI was somewhat surprised by the magnitude of ongoing aspirin use in older adults,\u201d Dr. Mohak Gupta, resident physician at Cleveland Clinic and lead author of the study, said in an email. The study suggests that millions of US adults who\u2019ve never had cardiovascular disease could still be taking a daily aspirin, despite recommendations against it. A separate survey conducted last year by researchers at the University of Michigan found that about 1 in 4 adults surveyed, ages 50 to 80, reported taking aspirin regularly, around three or more days in a typical week \u2013 and this was seen among more men than women. Among those regularly taking aspirin, 89% reported taking a low-dose aspirin, according to the survey, while 11% indicated they take regular strength aspirin, which makes their risk of excessive bleeding even higher. About half of older adults regularly taking aspirin reported starting more than five years ago; about 19% said they started four to five years ago, and 30% started within the past three years. The survey, called the National Poll on Healthy Aging, was administered online and via telephone in July and August 2023 and included more than 2,600 adults. \u2018This is the nature of science\u2019 Because aspirin historically has been seen as a preventive tool for cardiovascular disease, it has been difficult to change some of the societal views and behaviors among older adults. \u201cAspirin has been recommended for preventing a first heart attack or stroke since the late 1990s,\u201d Gupta said. \u201cAs a result, aspirin use for primary prevention\u00a0of cardiovascular disease has remained\u00a0highly prevalent, especially among older adults who are at higher risk of cardiovascular events.\u201d Early studies on aspirin use, dating back to the 1980s and 1990s, showed that there was benefit to taking aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, said cardiologist Dr. Donald Lloyd-Jones, a past president\u00a0of the American Heart Association and chair of the department of preventive medicine at Northwestern University. \u201cBut think back at what else was happening at those times. We didn\u2019t really use statins in very many patients. We weren\u2019t doing a good job controlling blood pressure. And so aspirin, as the final safety net for preventing a heart attack or stroke, because it prevents blood clot formation, aspirin had room and it had space to work,\u201d Lloyd-Jones said. As aspirin was studied more closely, and as more patients at risk of cardiovascular disease started to take statins to help control their cholesterol levels, it became clear that the risks of aspirin use outweighed the benefits for certain patients, Lloyd-Jones said. He added, however, that there are still subgroups of people for which the benefits of aspirin continue to outweigh the risks, and the guidance for them should not be ignored either. \u201cThis is the nature of science. We make these broad recommendations for populations, but as we study individuals, we find that there are actually still situations where the benefit of aspirin \u2014 that is, the likelihood that we\u2019re going to prevent a heart attack or stroke \u2014 will outweigh the risk of aspirin, which is that we could cause major bleeding,\u201d said Lloyd-Jones, who was not involved in the new study on aspirin use among US adults. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that we\u2019re crystal clear and precise that people who\u2019ve had a heart attack or a stroke or who have a stent should be taking aspirin,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had my own patients come back and say, \u2018Oh yeah, I saw the news. I stopped my aspirin,\u2019 and that\u2019s dangerous.\u201d The American Heart Association\u2019s current recommendation is that no one should take daily low-dose aspirin without talking to their doctor first, especially if they have an aspirin intolerance, are at risk of gastrointestinal bleeding or hemorrhagic stroke, drink alcohol regularly, are undergoing any simple medical or dental procedures, or are older than 70. For people who have had a heart attack or stroke, their health care providers may want them to take aspirin to help prevent another event. Yet it remains unclear when someone already taking a daily low-dose aspirin for their cardiovascular health should stop \u2014 and that might be an individual decision between a patient and their doctor. \u201cWhile guidelines recommend against starting preventive aspirin in older adults, there is uncertainty about the optimal age to discontinue preventive aspirin in those already taking it, as these two scenarios have different risk-benefit considerations,\u201d Gupta said. \u2018Communication gap is the chief reason\u2019 The new study in Annals of Internal Medicine underscores \u201can important and concerning trend,\u201d that many older adults continue to take aspirin for their cardiovascular health despite the updated recommendations, Dr. Dave Montgomery, a cardiologist at Piedmont Healthcare in Atlanta, who was not involved in the new research, said in an email to CNN. \u201cIt brings to light a gap in effective dissemination of these guidelines to the general public. The other\u00a0alarming aspect is that many individuals are taking aspirin without the guidance of a healthcare provider,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cThe communication gap is the chief reason for this. The guidelines are clear and based on good science. We just haven\u2019t communicated this new guidance effectively or broadly enough,\u201d he added. \u201cThe decision to use aspirin must be an individual one, based on the person\u2019s unique risk profile. No two cases are exactly the same, and I strongly advise that no one should make a change in their prevention strategy without the counsel of a medical professional.\u201d Dr. Howard Weintraub, a preventive cardiologist at NYU Langone Health in New York, said that he has seen among his own patients that some older adults continue to regularly take aspirin to prevent cardiovascular disease despite the shift in guidance. For those patients, Weintraub said that he can conduct tests to analyze their blood pressure, cholesterol levels and weigh a personalized risk-benefit profile for them in order to recommend whether they stop taking aspirin or continue to do so. For some patients, the risk of excessive bleeding that comes with taking aspirin regularly outweighs the benefits. \u201cThe drug that they may feel to be very benign, may have some baggage or potential adverse events,\u201d Weintraub said. But for others, aspirin may still be the right choice. Regardless, any patient taking aspirin regularly should discuss that behavior with their physician, Weintraub said. \u201cThey should disclose that they\u2019re using it. They should have a conversation with their primary or cardiologist, whoever is in their mind trustworthy, and come to an understanding as to how they should go forward,\u201d Weintraub said. \u201cAdopting a more personalized, individualized course of therapy may have a great benefit.\u201d And to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, Weintraub recommended that people stop smoking if they smoke, lose weight, eat healthy foods, control their cholesterol levels and try to prevent high blood pressure.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/health/aspirin-heart-older-adults-recommendations-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_health_bids-for-connection-better-relationship-wellness", "text": "\u201cThere\u2019s a woodpecker over there!\u201d Alyssa Caribardi watched as her friend whipped her head around to look out the window and seek out the bird. And with that simple gesture, Caribardi knew their friendship would last. In what may seem like a small, everyday exchange, her friend\u2019s reaction was an important indicator for their relationship: She had responded to Caribardi\u2019s \u201cbid for connection,\u201d a term coined by relationship experts at the\u00a0Gottman Institute\u00a0in Seattle. Their interaction might not look important to outsiders, but Caribardi had given someone close to her an opportunity to connect, and her friend had reciprocated. \u201cBids for connection are when one partner reaches out to the other person for either interest, or a conversation or expressing a need,\u201d said Dr. Julie Schwartz Gottman, a clinical psychologist who has researched couples and long-lasting marriages alongside her husband, Dr. John Gottman, for more than 40 years. \u201cDepending on how the partner responds, the relationship either succeeds or doesn\u2019t do so well.\u201d The bids can be verbal or physical, such as pointing out a bird in a tree, repeating something heard on TV, asking for advice or even simply directing a smile at the other person. Whether the bid is big or small doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 what is important is the other person\u2019s response,\u00a0Schwartz Gottman\u00a0said. And it\u2019s not just important for couples to know about these opportunities to connect \u2014 it also affects parent-child relationships, friendships, even business ties, she noted. How to recognize a \u2018bid for connection\u2019 The basis of \u201cbids for connection\u201d stems from the Gottmans\u2019 \u201cLove Lab\u201d research, which started\u00a0in 1986 and tracked couples for six years. At the end of that time, the couples still together were found to have responded to each other\u2019s bids 86% of the time, while those who split up only responded 33% of the time. Caribardi knows that feeling. The Leander, Texas, native said she thought the woodpecker was neat, partially because she had never seen one before. But the fun part was her friend\u2019s reciprocated interest that spiraled into a deep-dive Google session on the bird. \u201cWe can talk about literally anything and everything \u2014 a brick wall could talk to us. And the woodpecker showed me that,\u201d Caribardi said. \u201cBut even if she just said, like, \u2018Oh, yeah, that is really cool,\u2019 that\u2019s literally the only thing that you need. Just someone to acknowledge what you\u2019re saying.\u201d Caribardi posted her experience with the woodpecker on TikTok in October, referring to it as \u201cthe bird test,\u201d alongside others who took to the app to recount their experience with giving out small bids \u2014 such as pointing out cool birds \u2014 to their friends and partners. Schwartz Gottman\u00a0said this test is a good example of the importance of \u201cturning toward\u201d a partner, one of the three responses someone can have to a bid. If a partner responds to a bid, even with a simple acknowledgement that the other person was heard, it is the best and most beneficial response to have. If the partner were to ignore the other person and have no verbal response to the bid being made, she calls that \u201cturning away.\u201d But the worst response is what\u00a0Schwartz Gottman\u00a0calls \u201cturning against,\u201d which happens when there is hostility toward the bid. Partners may respond with a comment such as \u201cStop interrupting what I\u2019m doing,\u201d or another variation that tells the other person they don\u2019t care about the bid. \u201cMost of us, at the end of the day, want to be seen and understood and feel important. And so, when there are too many bids that are missed or rejected, it leaves you feeling the opposite: unseen, unimportant, misunderstood,\u201d said Dr. Lauren Fogel Mersy, a licensed psychologist and sex therapist based in Minnesota. \u201cIf that happens more often than not, it starts to erode connection and safety and trust in a relationship.\u201d What to do when your partner wants to connect While bids look to be crucial in a relationship, no one is perfect and should not be expected to answer a bid all the time, Fogel Mersy said. \u201cYou just want a ratio of more positive to negative responses to bids.\u201d If someone notices a partner has missed or continuously misses a bid, she recommends communicating the intent for attention by saying, \u201cHey, that was my way of trying to connect with you,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m looking to converse with you, or get some attention from you, is now a good time?\u201d Fogel Mersy also recommends people become more aware of their own responses when partners make a bid and even ask their partners directly if they feel they are getting responses to their calls for attention. The more direct a person is with a bid and its intent, the more likely the bid is to be reciprocated, she added. It\u2019s OK if a person notices that a partner is sending out a bid to connect but isn\u2019t feeling up to connecting at the moment, maybe because they are too tired or have a lot on their mind.\u00a0Schwartz Gottman\u00a0recommends communicating those feelings directly and honestly to the partner, instead of lashing out with a \u201cturning against\u201d response. \u201cMost of the time, if the response is positive, it\u2019s not really going to matter how small or big (the bid) is, but with negative \u2018turning away,\u2019 or \u2018turning against,\u2019 those can cause some real emotional damage in the relationship,\u201d\u00a0Schwartz Gottman\u00a0said. The takeaway is \u201cthat turning toward one another is really the foundation of a good strong friendship \u2014 and also passion and romance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/health/bids-for-connection-better-relationship-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_health_improve-diet-quality-tips-wellness", "text": "There\u2019s a crack of light shining through the dark clouds of America\u2019s battle with poor nutrition and subsequent health issues, according to a new study that analyzed two decades of nutritional data. \u201cThere is good news. Americans are starting to hear the message about nutrition, and some companies and restaurants are starting to make healthier products. It\u2019s a little bit of an improvement,\u201d said senior study author and cardiologist Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, director of the Food is Medicine Institute at Tufts University in Boston. However, he added, the majority of the improvement occurred between 1999 and 2010, with no advances in nutrition after that. \u201cWe have stalled as a nation \u2014 and that does not bode well for our health,\u201d Mozaffarian said. \u201cIf I was grading America on its diet, I\u2019d give it a D\u2014just up from an F.\u201d An upward trend, but more is needed The number of adults in the United States who ate a poor diet decreased from about 49% to just over 37% between 1999 and 2020 \u2014 a drop of 11.4%, while those who ate somewhat better nutritionally rose by 10.5%, the study found. A poor diet was defined as one with too many refined grains, processed meat and sugary beverages, including fruit juice, as well as ultraprocessed foods full of added sugar, salt and fat.\u00a0Healthy choices such as fruits and vegetables are extremely low in this eating style. \u201cIntake of fruits and vegetables didn\u2019t increase at all over this 20-year period, which is pretty striking,\u201d Mozaffarian said. An ideal diet included at least the daily recommended servings of fruits and vegetables, as well as more beans, whole grains, nuts and seeds. Dietary guidelines such as those from the American Heart Association suggest eating 4 to 5 cups a day of canned, fresh or frozen fruits and the same amount for vegetables. The nutritionally ideal diet also contained few sugary beverages, processed meats, refined grains and ultraprocessed food, which is often high in added sugars, fat and salt, the study said. Unfortunately, the number of people who ate an ideal diet \u2013\u2014 which included those 9 cups of fruits and vegetables \u2014 rose less than 1%, the study found. \u201cPeople often ask me, \u2018Well, if the diet\u2019s slowly improving, why is obesity and diabetes still going up?\u2019 It\u2019s still going up because only 1.58% of Americans have an ideal diet. We still have a long way to go,\u201d Mozaffarian said. More than a million Americans die each year from diet-related diseases such as obesity, cancer, heart disease and type 2 diabetes,\u00a0according to the US Food and Drug Administration, while unhealthy diets and food insecurity cost the United States an\u00a0estimated $1.1 trillion in healthcare expenditures and lost productivity annually. \u201cI think it is correct to emphasize that diet quality remains dismal in the US. There is no secret why Americans are experiencing epidemics of obesity and diabetes and declining life expectancy,\u201d said Dr. Walter Willett, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, in an email. He was not involved in the study. Food insecurity is a major issue The study, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, analyzed dietary information on nearly 52,000 US adults who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, or NHANES. Nutritional advances were highest among women, younger adults, Hispanic adults, and people with more education and higher incomes who had access to private health care insurance. Fewer gains were seen in men, Black or older adults and people with less income, lower educational levels, non-private health insurance, and food insecurity issues. \u201cDisparities in the population by education and income and race and ethnicity are the same or sometimes getting worse,\u201d Mozaffarian said. The study found that people with lower income saw a 5% improvement in nutritional quality, while those with higher incomes improved their nutritional score by 16%. \u201cWe do need to avoid just blaming the victims of the dysfunctional US food system for the terrible diets documented in the survey,\u201d Willett said. \u201cWe fail to educate students about nutrition in our schools and feed them unhealthy diets. \u201cOur health care system is missing in action almost completely, we allow advertising to seduce children into junk foods and beverages that kill them prematurely, and we indirectly subsidize unhealthy foods in many ways that make healthier options relatively more expensive and less available to low-income Americans,\u201d he said. How to improve your nutrition There are easy steps you can take to boost the nutritional quality of your diet, experts say. Cook at home as often as possible: \u201cMy top suggestion is to shop at the grocery store as much as you can, rather than getting your food at a coffee shop, sandwich shop or quick-serve restaurant,\u201d Mozaffarian said. Even eating at a full-service restaurant should be limited, he added. Prior research by Mozaffarian and his team found about 80% of all food consumed by Americans from restaurants was of poor diet quality. \u201cShockingly, even when we compared fast food versus sit-down restaurants, there wasn\u2019t a dramatic difference in quality,\u201d he said. Instead, try to choose minimally-processed foods to cook at home and avoid the ready-to-heat-and-eat convenience foods so prevalent at the grocery store. Bring your lunch and snacks to work. Don\u2019t drink your sugar. Americans are beginning to get the idea that sugary sodas are unhealthy, but they have not yet made the connection that energy, sports and caffeinated drinks can be equally sugar laden, Mozaffarian said. \u201cEnergy drinks, pre-sweetened iced teas, and specialty coffee drinks can have more sugar than soda,\u201d he said. \u201cI see people walking out of the coffee shop with drinks with whipped cream on top. Don\u2019t drink your sugar.\u201d However, once sugary beverages are removed from the equation, only \u201c6% of calories in the country come from added sugar in foods,\u201d Mozaffarian said. \u201cIn contrast, about 35% of calories in the country come from refined grains and starches.\u201d Limit refined grains.\u00a0Overall, the biggest contributor to the poor quality diet of Americans is refined grains, at 5.2 servings per day \u2014 \u201calmost two servings a meal of refined grains such as refined bread, refined rice, crackers, chips, and other ultraprocessed foods,\u201d Mozaffarian said. Whole grains still contain the bran and germ, which is a nutritional powerhouse full of healthy fats, antioxidants, minerals and E and B vitamins. Whole grains take longer to digest, don\u2019t raise blood sugar as quickly as refined grains and contain more fiber, which can reduce the risk of chronic disease, promote weight loss, and improve digestion. \u201cSome examples of whole grains include barley, bulgur, farro, millet, quinoa, black rice, brown rice, red rice, wild rice, oatmeal and popcorn,\u201d according to My Plate, the US Department of Agriculture website. Refined grains such as white flour, corn grits, white bread and white rice have been milled, removing the bran and germ, to give them a finer texture and longer shelf life. Milling also removes nutrients like dietary fiber, iron and vitamins.\u00a0Refined grains are found in nearly all ultraprocessed foods, including breakfast cereals, desserts, pastries, bread and crackers. Replace refined grains. Instead, nourish your gut microbiome with fruits and vegetables, beans, nuts and seeds and minimally-processed whole grains,\u201d Mozaffarian said. Fermented foods such as yogurt, sauerkraut and kimchi can also help the microbiome, he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/health/improve-diet-quality-tips-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_health_study-infant-mortality-texas-invs", "text": "A new study has drawn\u00a0a possible\u00a0link between rising infant mortality in Texas and the state\u2019s abortion restrictions, which, when they took effect in 2021, were the strictest in the nation. The\u00a0study, published today in JAMA Pediatrics \u2013 a publication\u00a0of\u00a0the Journal of the American Medical Association \u2013 cited an\u00a0investigative report\u00a0by CNN last year that revealed a sudden spike in infant deaths in the wake of the law\u2019s passage. \u201cA report from the media found an increase in infant deaths in Texas between 2021 and 2022, suggesting that Texas\u2019 abortion policy could be responsible,\u201d according to the study by researchers at Johns Hopkins University and Michigan State University. \u201cHowever, to our knowledge, no studies have conducted a systematic evaluation of infant mortality after the passage of Texas\u2019 (law).\u201d The authors say their study is the first attempt to do so, and their conclusions echo the findings of CNN\u2019s story. In\u00a0September\u00a02021, Texas banned nearly all abortions beyond about six weeks of pregnancy. When the US Supreme Court overturned federal abortion rights the following summer, a trigger law in the state banned all abortions other than those intended to protect the life of the mother. The study looks at the effects of the\u00a02021\u00a0law, called Senate Bill 8, which made no exceptions for rape or incest, forcing women to carry a pregnancy to term even under traumatic circumstances. It also made no exceptions for congenital anomalies, also known as birth defects. The only exception that allowed for an abortion to be obtained after six weeks was \u201cif a physician believes that a medical emergency exists,\u201d according to the language of the bill. The new JAMA Pediatrics study found that, between 2021 and 2022, infant deaths in Texas surged 12.9%, compared with a much smaller increase\u00a0in the rest of the US\u00a0of 1.8%. It also found a significant jump in the rate of infant mortality in Texas \u2013 or the number of deaths per thousand live births \u2013 relative to\u00a0the rest of the country, suggesting that the increase in the number of infant deaths was not solely the byproduct of a rise in births. In that same time period, infant mortality rates rose 8.3% in Texas, compared with an increase of 2.2% in the rest of the nation. The neonatal mortality rate \u2013 or the death rates of babies younger than 28 days \u2013 also increased in Texas by 5.8% but decreased in the rest of the US, the study found. \u201cThis study provides some of the first empirical evidence on the association of restrictive abortion policies with infant deaths by using population-based data and a rigorous causal inference technique,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cAlthough replication and further analyses are needed to understand the mechanisms behind these findings, our results indicate that restrictive abortion policies may have important unintended consequences in terms of trauma to families and medical cost.\u201d The study \u2013 whose lead author, Dr. Alison Gemmill, is a demographer and perinatal epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University \u2013\u00a0was published alongside a critique\u00a0of the Texas law by three unaffiliated medical experts in an editorial. \u201cIn the coming years, as more people continue to be harmed by abortion bans across the country, we anticipate that more research will illuminate what Texans already know to be true: abortion bans harm everyone,\u201d wrote Ghazaleh Moayedi and Aketch Osamba, both of the  Pegasus Health Justice Center in Dallas, and Atsuko Koyama, of the University of Arizona, in the editorial. \u201cFuture scholarship should focus on best practices and implementation strategies for collective action against and resistance to the increasing trend of extremist ideologies influencing the practice of medicine,\u201d the authors wrote. The study also found that\u00a0the number of\u00a0congenital anomalies increased in Texas\u00a0from 2021 to 2022\u00a0but not\u00a0in\u00a0the rest of the US. The authors based their study on publicly available death-certificate data and looked at infant and neonatal deaths across the country from January 2018 to December 2022.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/health/study-infant-mortality-texas-invs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "health"}}

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is partnering with the state of Michigan to begin a highly anticipated study to assess whether workers exposed to infected cattle had themselves become infected. And the US Food and Drug Administration is testing what\u2019s known as flash pasteurization after recent studies raised questions about whether the method neutralizes all infectious virus in milk. The projects are part of a suite of new research announced by federal agencies on Tuesday to understand the dynamics of H5N1 bird flu, which for the first time jumped from birds to dairy cattle around the beginning of the year.\u00a0 Since late March, more than 120 herds across 12 states have tested positive for the highly contagious infection, which appears to be spreading through contact with raw milk, the US Department of Agriculture confirmed. \u201cWe know this to be spread by contact with milk,\u201d said Dr. Eric Deeble, who is the acting senior adviser for highly pathogenic avian influenza at the USDA. Deeble said that early on, the movement of cattle was largely driving spread of the infection. But since the USDA ordered cattle to be tested before they could be moved state-to-state in late April, the infection has been ferried between farms on shared equipment and shared workers, according to a recent epidemiological study by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, or MDARD. \u201cWe know that milk has really high viral loads, and so when we\u2019re looking at transmission patterns,\u00a0that\u2019s a really high risk, it seems,\u201d MDARD Director Dr. Tim Boring said. How\u00a0the virus is using humans to hitch a ride \u2014 whether through infection or contaminated clothing or skin \u2014 isn\u2019t clear yet, Boring said. \u201cMy guess it\u2019s perhaps not truly binary, whether it is on people or in people,\u201d Boring said. Dairy farmers have been reluctant to let government officials onto their farms forwidespread testing of their herds, and farm workers have shied away from testing, even when they have symptoms.\u00a0 Advocates say workers are reluctant to test since it might mean missing work and pay. Last week, Michigan said it would\u00a0pay up to 20 dairy farms\u00a0a maximum of $28,000 each to participate in research.\u00a0That financial assistance is on top of funds\u00a0the federal government is offering. The offer seems to have worked.\u00a0 On Tuesday, the CDC announced that it had partnered with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to launch a study to test the blood of farm workers for antibodies to the H5N1 virus. \u201cThe point of this study is to determine if there is asymptomatic infection\u201d of workers who have been exposed to cows infected with the H5N1 virus, said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis,\u00a0 director of the CDC\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. The FDA also announced Tuesday that it has started another round of dairy product sampling to address gaps in its previous testing.\u00a0 This time, the 155 products it\u2019s plucking from store shelves will include raw milk cheeses, cream cheese, ice cream and butter, said Dr. Don Prater, acting director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. Earlier this year, FDA\u2019s initial testing of milk and sour cream and other and other kinds of dairy products purchased at grocery stores found traces of virus in 1 out of 5 items sampled. Further testing confirmed, however, that those viral fragments were inactive and couldn\u2019t make anyone sick, leading the agency to declare milk and other dairy products safe to consume, as long as they\u2019re pasteurized. But\u00a0two recent\u00a0lab studies\u00a0published in the\u00a0New England Journal of Medicine raised new questions. The studies\u00a0heated raw, infected milk to the times and temperatures used for flash pasteurization \u2014 the most common form of pasteurization in the US \u2014\u00a0and found that while it greatly reduced levels of infectious virus in milk, it didn\u2019t completely neutralize all of it. Scientists cautioned, however, that because the experiments didn\u2019t replicate the full flash pasteurization process, including a pre-heating step, more research was needed. Prater said the FDA believes its experiments are closer to the method used in commercial milk processing. Also on the FDA\u2019s\u00a0to-do list\u00a0are studies to measure the persistence of the virus in cheese as it ages, and pooled testing of raw milk samples from dairies. Prater didn\u2019t give a specific timeline for when the agency would have results from those studies, but said it hope to have the information in the very near future.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/health/new-studies-bird-flu-dairy-workers-and-dairy-products/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "health"}}

There\u2019s also FDA-approved injected ketamine, brand-named Ketalar, which can be prescribed off-label. Both can be a fast-acting lifeline for people living with depression that hasn\u2019t been relieved by other types of treatments.\u00a0Getting the drug, or a derivative of it, through a vein or as a squirt up the nose requires close medical supervision in a clinic, however, making these options hard for some people to access or even to do. \u201cIt\u2019s very logistically involved. You have to come in and be observed for a couple hours,\u201d said Dr. Brian Barnett, clinical director of the Psychiatric Treatment Resistance Program at the Cleveland Clinic, who was not involved in the study.\u00a0\u201cThe field has really been looking for a way to take advantage of ketamine for depression but let patients take this at home in the form of a pill.\u201d To confuse matters even further, compounded ketamine lozenges and pills are available through online pharmacies and can be obtained with a prescription, but the FDA warned patients and providers about using compounded ketamine last fall because these products have not been evaluated for safety and effectiveness. Some doctors who prescribe ketamine for depression say they are wary of the oral forms because it\u2019s not clear how much of the drug actually makes it to a patient\u2019s bloodstream. Patients need to be monitored closely because ketamine, which was originally used to dull pain in surgery, can cause feelings of disconnection or disassociation from their bodies and the world around them. It also distorts thinking and decision-making.\u00a0Some find this hallucinogenic experience beneficial and even pleasant, but others have described it as terrifying.\u00a0These forms of the drug can also cause a person\u2019s blood pressure to go up, which may make them off-limits for those with heart conditions. The clinic setting limits who can get the treatment as well, Barnett said.\u00a0Not all areas have clinics that can do this kind of intensive monitoring, and patients aren\u2019t allowed to drive until the morning after an infusion, so treatments may be out-of-reach if they can\u2019t get a ride or afford a hotel stay. From a public health standpoint, Barnett said, you can serve more people with a pill than with clinic-based treatments.\u00a0A 2021 study estimated that in any given year, 2.8 million American adults have treatment-resistant depression. \u201cIt would be very beneficial for many people to have this available as a medication that they could take at home. But obviously, we want a medication like that to have very minimal dissociative side effects,\u201d Barnett said. That\u2019s where slow-release ketamine pills come in. Studying drug withdrawal to see if it works For the study, which was published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, researchers in New Zealand enrolled 231 adults who had been diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression, meaning they had tried at least two different antidepressants to lift their mood without success. The study participants scored an average of 30 points on a clinical scale that measures depressive symptoms, a score that\u2019s considered moderate depression, and on average, they\u2019d tried nearly five different treatments without relief. For the first five days of the study, all of the participants took a daily dose of 120 milligrams of ketamine in the form of a slow-release pill.\u00a0On day eight, the researchers assessed who had responded to the drug.\u00a0Slightly more than half the group \u2013 132 \u2013 had remission of their symptoms, meaning they scored under 10 on the clinical scale. Overall, 168 had some degree of benefit and were considered responders to the pill. People who had not responded to the drug were not eligible to continue with the research. Those 168 adults were randomly assigned to one of five treatment groups;\u00a037 people got a  placebo, or dummy pill, while roughly equal-size groups took one of four daily doses of ketamine that ranged from 30 milligrams to 180 milligrams. By 14 weeks, everyone taking ketamine still continued to see some relief from their depression, but for most groups, the differences compared with placebo were not statistically significant, meaning they could have been observed due to chance alone. Researchers did see what\u2019s called a dose response, however, meaning the higher the dose of the drug, the more relief participants had in their depressive symptoms, which is usually a sign that the drug is having a real effect. People who took the highest dose, 180 milligrams a day, did see a statistically significant benefit, a reduction in their depression score of about six points compared with the placebo group. \u201cThe results here, they look encouraging,\u201d Barnett said, noting that a two-point drop in the clinical rating scale the researchers used is considered meaningful to patients. A six-point drop is \u201csimilar to what we\u2019ve seen in recent clinical trials of psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression,\u201d Barnett said, referring to a chemical in certain mushrooms that\u2019s currently being studied. During the first five days of the study, when everyone was taking the drug, the most common side effects reported were dizziness, headache, dissociation, fatigue, feeling abnormal and nausea. About 11% of people taking the 120 milligram ketamine pill at the beginning of the study said they experienced dissociation or feeling disconnected.\u00a0But this appeared to be much milder than the dissociation reported by people who get ketamine infusions.\u00a0On a commonly used rating scale, people taking the ketamine pill ranked below a score of 3 in the first phase of the study, but another study found that people getting IV ketamine rated their dissociation around a 7. Effects on blood pressure were also minimal with the slow-release pill. Weighing study biases Experts agree that the study was an important first step. \u201cThe report is important since it is the first large placebo-controlled study to be published attempting to explore the benefits of oral ketamine,\u201d Dr. Gerard Sanacora, director of the Yale Depression Research Program, who was not involved in the study, wrote in an email. But Sanacora said the design of the study, which is known as a randomized withdrawal trial, probably biased the results in favor of making the drug look more effective than it might be in the real world, something the study authors acknowledge, too. By studying only people who responded to the drug, the study authors noted that they hoped to avoid the high failure rates of many antidepressants tested in a general population, where as many as 50% of trials fail to show an effect compared with a placebo. Sanacora said it\u2019s very likely that the study participants could have known they were getting ketamine, rather than the placebo, and therefore expected it to work. \u201cIt is usually easier to guess correctly once you have been exposed to the active treatment and then receive the inactive treatment,\u201d he wrote. Therefore, he said, it would be really important for the pills to be retested in a larger population to get an idea of how well they might work in the real world. He noted that there\u2019s a \u201ctremendous tension\u201d between wanting the important benefits of a drug like ketamine to be more available to people and making sure the treatment can be given safely and responsibly. \u201cThis is a step in the right direction, but we clearly need more high-quality data before we can say much more about the overall efficacy and safety of the new form of treatment and especially the safety of doing this at home,\u201d Sanacora wrote. Challenges of oral dosing Perhaps unsurprisingly, the study, which led to withdrawal and depression relapse for many, had a high drop-out rate.\u00a0Of the 168 people who initially saw benefit from the pills, 100 didn\u2019t complete the trial.\u00a0Ninety-four left because they stopped being helped by their treatment.\u00a0One person left because of an adverse event. Four others left for unspecified reasons.\u00a0A 65-year-old man died as a result of suicide. The researchers say the study\u2019s independent review committee judged that the death was a result of the patient\u2019s depression rather than the treatment. \u201cAttempted and completed suicide is a sad reality of treatment trials in patients with depression,\u201d noted study author Dr. Paul Glue, a professor in the Department of Psychological Medicine at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand, in an email. Both Barnett and Sanacora agreed that it was difficult to know whether the drug played any role in a study this size and said that larger studies were needed to tease out any serious safety signals. Among the participants, women and younger adults tended to have stronger treatment effects than men and older adults. That may have something to do with the way the pills are metabolized, Barnett said. \u201cOne of the challenges with oral ketamine, one of the reasons that we haven\u2019t used as much for depression as IV, is that it can be sort of unpredictable, and how much is getting into the bloodstream?\u201d he said. However, he thought the slow-release form of the pill probably helped with maintaining a steadier dose.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/health/ketamine-pill-depression-fewer-side-effects/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_health_resistance-training-older-adults-wellness", "text": "Retirement should be filled with time with loved ones, relaxation and\u2014according to new research\u2014heavy lifting. As people get older, their skeletal muscle function declines, according to the study published Tuesday in the journal BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine. \u201cIf you do resistance training at this age, benefits in some parameters may last several years,\u201d said lead study author \ufeffMads Bloch-Ibenfeldt, a doctoral student at the Institute of Sports Medicine at Bispebjerg Hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark. To investigate whether resistance exercise programs could be helpful in the long term, researchers performed a randomized control trial with 369 recently retired and healthy adults who were between 64 and 75 years old. The participants were assigned one of three exercise programs for a year. They either lifted weights three times a week, did moderate-intensity training using their body weight and resistance bands three times a week, or did not change their usual exercise routines, the study said. Researchers measured their bone and muscle strength as well as body fat levels at the start of the trial at the end of the one-year program and then two and four years later, according to the study. It was up to the individuals whether they continued their strength training regimen or went back to their normal exercise level, Resistance training with heavy loads yielded the greatest long-lasting benefit in leg strength, the study showed. Even four years after the training, their leg strength was unaltered, whereas the moderate-intensity group did see a decrease \u2013 although it wasn\u2019t significant, the study showed. \u201cExercise is critically important across the life span. This study does show that even in those engaging in activity later in life around retirement can lead to marked benefits to one\u2019s health,\u201d said Dr. John Batsis, a geriatrician and an associate professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the School of Medicine (Geriatric Medicine) and in the Gillings School of Global Public Health (Nutrition). He was not involved in the research. What counts as resistance training? The umbrella of exercise includes aerobic, resistance, flexibility and balance activities, Batsis said. \u201cEach of these have important consequences if one regularly performs them or does not on overall health (including cognition) and physical function,\u201d Batsis\ufeff said in an email. You can think of resistance training as \u201cexercises that improve strength by making muscles work against a force,\u201d said CNN fitness contributor Dana Santas, a mind-body coach for professional athletes. That force can include weights, resistance bands or your own body weight\u2014like with pushups or squats, she added. \u201cFor older adults, resistance training is crucial for maintaining muscle mass, bone density, and mobility,\u201d she said. According to the recent study, adding heavier weight seems to be important, Bloch-Ibenfeldt said. What you can do at home One limitation of the exercise proposed in the recent study is that the weighted exercises were done at a gym, which is something not everyone has the time, money or transportation to do, Batsis said. While you should consult a certified trainer or physical therapist to ensure\ufeff you are exercising safely, there are things you can do from home, Santas said. For older adults, it is important to strengthen in ways that are important to functional movements of everyday living, she added. Santas recommends box squats, where you sit lightly on a chair seat and stand back up. If you don\u2019t need to hold the arms of the chair for support, add some dumbbells, Santas said. The added weight gives \u201cadditional resistance while also improving\u00a0grip strength, which is essential for functional independence and serves as (a) marker for heart health,\u201d she added. You can also increase strength in functional movements, protect your knee joints and prevent injury by placing a resistance band around both of your legs and doing side steps,\u00a0side lunging\u00a0or\u00a0reverse lunging, she said. Try to do two or three sets of eight to 12 of each activity at least a couple of times a week, Santas said. Regular maintenance of exercise and other health factors are important for independence later in life, Batsis said. \u201cThe basics of lifestyle changes, including nutrition and exercise are a major key to healthy aging,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/health/resistance-training-older-adults-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_health_summer-heat-water-hydration-exercise-wellness", "text": "More water, please. Millions of Americans are experiencing a record-breaking heat wave that has continued for days on end. We know that keeping hydrated is important to staying healthy in the summer heat, but is water still the best drink during a heat wave? Or should people turn to sports drinks instead? What about soda, coffee and beer \u2014 is it advisable to keep drinking these beverages during extremely hot weather? To help guide us through drinks we should choose \u2014 and avoid \u2014 during hot weather events, I spoke with CNN wellness health expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner. CNN: How much water should people normally drink, and does that change during extreme hot weather? Dr. Leana Wen: A quick rule of thumb that\u2019s often cited is the \u201c8 x 8 rule,\u201d which is eight 8-ounce glasses of water, or 64 ounces, of water per day for adults. That\u2019s half a gallon. This rule is not set in stone. There are many factors that influence how much water people need, including the type of food they eat, their body size and their physical activity. Other factors include air temperature and humidity, and, specifically, how much time you spend outdoors during hot weather. People working in the heat or otherwise engaging in physical activity should drink an 8-ounce cup of water every 15 to 20 minutes, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This would total about 24 to 32 ounces per hour. People should also keep well hydrated before and after their outdoor time in the heat. CNN: Is it possible to drink too much water? Wen: Yes. The CDC guidance is that people should not drink more than 48 ounces (about 1.5 quarts) of water or other fluids in an hour. A large amount of fluid all at once can dilute the concentration of salts in our blood and be unsafe. CNN: When it\u2019s really hot outside, is water still the best fluid, or should people turn to sports drinks?  Wen: Sports drinks are beverages with added electrolytes. Their main purpose is to replenish water and electrolytes that are lost with sweating. These drinks contain electrolytes like sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium. Some have added sugars like fructose, glucose and sucrose.  Most people do not need drinks other than water. In general, adults engaging in mild to moderate physical activity and kids playing on the playground or doing recreational after-school sports do not need electrolyte replacement. The foods that we eat contain the electrolytes we need. People who could consider sports drinks are athletes who are engaging in vigorous exercise for at least an hour outdoors in hot weather. Again, though, not all these individuals will need electrolyte replacement beyond what they get from eating normally. Whether they do depends on factors such as how much they sweat, how hot and humid the environment is and how intensely they exercise. CNN: What\u2019s better, a sports drink that comes ready-made in a bottle or an electrolyte powder that you can add to make your own drink? Wen: Personally, I prefer the powder. There are also tablets that dissolve in water. These do-it-yourself options are cheaper, and I like to choose the brands that don\u2019t have much added sugar or chemicals. But this is a question of personal preference. Whatever you buy, make sure to look carefully at the ingredients. For instance, if you don\u2019t want added sugar or caffeine, make sure what you\u2019re drinking doesn\u2019t have these ingredients. CNN: What about energy drinks? Are these a good replacement for water? Wen: This is an important question. The short answer is no, energy drinks are not a replacement for water. They should be used with caution in adults, and children should not drink them. Energy drinks are different from sports drinks, which are meant to help you restore water and electrolytes. Energy drinks are not meant mainly to hydrate you. They often contain large amounts of caffeine and other legal stimulants such as L-carnitine and guarana. While caffeine can boost energy in the short term, it is also a diuretic, meaning that it causes someone to lose water. Too much caffeine also can cause jitteriness, anxiety and irregular heartbeats. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against energy drinks for children and adolescents. In some studies, though, as many as 30% to 50% of adolescents report using energy drinks. I urge parents to be careful to distinguish between sports drinks and energy drinks. Neither are needed, but energy drinks, in particular, should be used with caution. CNN: What about other drinks with caffeine, like coffee? Is a cold brew or iced mocha a bad idea in hot weather? Wen: Not necessarily, though people should be aware that these caffeinated drinks may not hydrate you and may even dehydrate you further. This doesn\u2019t mean you should stop all coffee when it\u2019s hot outside. Just be aware of the effect of caffeine and consider drinking extra water while you are enjoying caffeinated beverages. CNN: What about sodas, punches and alcoholic beverages? Wen: Sodas and punches are considered ultraprocessed foods, which have been linked to many adverse long-term health consequences, such as increased risk of diabetes, heart disease and early death. Consumption should generally be kept at a minimum, and hot weather is no exception. Again, water is the preferred substance for hydration. Alcohol is best avoided when it\u2019s very hot outside. Be especially careful not to drink large amounts and become inebriated, as this could blunt your body\u2019s response to temperature regulation. You also may miss early signs of heat-related illnesses. Alcohol can be dehydrating as well. If you do choose to drink alcohol, limit your drinks, make sure there are people around you in case you get into trouble medically and be sure to drink plenty of additional nonalcoholic fluids. CNN: What about kids who are in all-day sports camps? Wen: It\u2019s hard to answer this without knowing exactly how the camp is structured. Many sports camps have indoor activities for at least a portion of the day, and even those that are predominantly outdoors should move their activities indoors during extreme heat warnings. When in doubt, it\u2019s advisable to speak with the camp director and ask about how much time will be spent outdoors. If the time is limited, there are regular breaks and much of the activity is low to moderate intensity, it\u2019s probably sufficient to hydrate with water and supplement with nutrient-dense snacks such as watermelon, coconut and avocado. Also focus on hydrating before and after camp. Sports drinks probably aren\u2019t needed, and, again, it\u2019s advisable for children to avoid energy drinks. CNN: What other precautions would you follow during extreme heat? Wen: Know the symptoms of heat exhaustion and heatstroke. Take extra care of children and the elderly, as well as people with chronic medical conditions that could be exacerbated by the heat. Be careful while exercising and try to move activities indoors or go in the early morning or late evening. And make sure to keep well-hydrated with the best substance for hydration \u2014 water!", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/health/summer-heat-water-hydration-exercise-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_health_gun-violence-stop-the-bleed-children-gupta", "text": "When I visited Rocklin Elementary school, I sat in on a lesson with a third-grade class \u2013\u00a0a lesson I would never have imagined as a father, a journalist or a trauma surgeon. \u201cChances are, you\u2019re never ever going to have to use this. If you do, it\u2019s gonna be scary,\u201d Kate Carleton told the 20 or so 8- and 9-year-olds. \u201cBut because we\u2019ve taught you what to do, it makes it a little less scary.\u201d She spent the next 30 minutes teaching them how to stop a wound from bleeding out. The lesson is appropriately titled \u201cStop the Bleed.\u201d Carleton is a trauma nurse at Sutter Roseville Medical Center, a level 2 trauma center in Rocklin,\u00a0California, a northern suburb of Sacramento. At the beginning of her 17-year career, she saw a lot of car crashes, motorcycle accidents and falls. More recently, the number of gunshot wounds coming through her hospital has increased, most often from domestic violence or suicide. On this day, she was\u00a0kneeling on the ground\u00a0to show these little kids the techniques paramedics often use in the field to stop bleeding. And as I looked around the classroom, I could tell that the kids were really listening. \u201cNow, if you\u2019ve got that bleeding to stop on that person, what did you do for their life?\u201d she asked the kids. Hands flew up. \u201cYou saved their life,\u201d answered one little girl. Born out of tragedy A litt\ufeffle\u00a0more than\u00a0seven years ago, Carleton was watching a special about the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, and like so many parents, she wondered about her own children, then in kindergarten and second grade. Was there anything she could do to make a difference and help keep them safer in a moment like that? Carleton\u00a0approached her daughter\u2019s kindergarten teacher and asked whether it was possible to create a curriculum to teach them how to handle these injuries. She wasn\u2019t sure what the response would be because after all, these were young children. But as the number of mass shootings continued to grow, so did the realization that anyone could suddenly become a first responder \u2014 even a child. The proposal was approved, and since then, she has been teaching classes to students throughout the Rocklin school district on the basics of bleeding control. Carleton is part of a larger movement also known as \u201cStop the Bleed,\u201d a campaign that was born out of the tragedy at Sandy Hook. Hartford Hospital trauma surgeon Dr. Lenworth Jacobs was tasked with reviewing the autopsies of the 20 children and six adults killed that day,\u00a0to find any lessons\u00a0that could be\u00a0learned out\u00a0of the horror. \u201cYou cannot imagine what the kinetic energy of an AR-15 does, or a bullet does, to a 6-year-old,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cThis is not civilized.\u201d School shootings are rare, but gunshot injuries are not Although a child dying at school in a mass shooting may be unlikely, a child dying from a gunshot is not. Firearms are the leading cause of death among people 18 and\u00a0younger\u00a0in the US, accounting for nearly\u00a019% of all childhood deaths. The\u00a0most recent data\u00a0from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that both the rate and the number of children dying from gunshot wounds are the highest they have been since 1999, when data on children\u2019s mortality and firearms was first collected. And although firearm mortality in the adult population is most often from suicide, for children, homicide is driving the deaths. After poring over the autopsies, Jacobs gathered trauma specialists from across the country and developed \u201ca protocol for national policy to enhance survivability from active shooter and intentional mass casualty events,\u201d known as the\u00a0Hartford Consensus. The nearly 100-page document included a letter from then-Vice President Joe Biden, who said the report was a \u201ccall to action.\u201d \u201cWith very little training and equipment, the individuals\u00a0closest to the scene of an accident or mass casualty situation can control bleeding until first responders arrive to take over treatment,\u201d Biden wrote. Much of the Hartford Consensus was adopted from lessons learned in combat in Afghanistan and Iraq. In the military, it\u2019s known as\u00a0\u201cbuddy aid\u201d: the practice of fellow troops being trained in first aid to help wounded colleagues on the battlefield. The practices are basic, but stopping bleeding, using a tourniquet and putting these steps into practice before a wounded soldier reaches the hospital greatly improves their chances of survival. Those troops who had tourniquets applied before their bodies went into shock had\u00a0a survival rate of 96%, compared with just 4% of those who got a tourniquet after blood loss caused them to go into shock. A driving tenet of the Hartford Consensus was time. \u201cPretty much all of these (mass casualty) events are over in 15 minutes, and it takes more than that to get the system to respond to you,\u201d Jacobs explained. Experts say that the average response time for an ambulance in urban areas in the US is\u00a0about eight minutes\u00a0\u2014 more time than it takes for a person to bleed out from a gunshot wound. Turning bystanders into first responders To give a person the best chance at survival after being shot, the priority is simple. \u201cStop the bleeding. Keep the blood inside the body,\u201d Jacobs said. The most efficient and quickest way to do that: turn bystanders into immediate responders by teaching them to pack a wound and use a tourniquet. \ufeffEleven years\u00a0after Jacobs and other experts first met to discuss what would ultimately become the Hartford Consensus,\u00a0more than 3 million people\u00a0worldwide have learned the basic principles of \u201cStop the Bleed\u201d through a certification program developed by the American College of Surgeons and the\u00a0American\u00a0Red Cross. According to the ACS, bleeding control kits containing gauze and tourniquets are now required in schools in at least\u00a010\u00a0states, and teachers and staff are required to be trained in at least\u00a0three\u00a0states. Two states require schools to offer Stop the Bleed training to students: in Arkansas for students in ninth grade and above and in Texas for those in seventh grade and above. After 19 fourth-graders and two teachers were killed at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, in 2022, a state representative introduced a bill proposing to lower the minimum grade for Stop the Bleed training to third grade. The bill never made it out of committee because of pushback. Carleton says she\u2019s not surprised. \u201cWhy it got started is frightening,\u201d she tells me, \u201cbut I do think there\u2019s a way to teach the information where it\u2019s not.\u201d Meeting kids where they\u2019re at When Carleton speaks to the kids, she doesn\u2019t mention guns or violence at all. During the class I visited, she asked the kids how many of their parents use power tools or could be hurt working around the house. \u201cIf I\u2019m working in the kitchen and I\u2019m cutting vegetables, can I get cut? Can that cause me to bleed?\u201d she\u00a0asked the students. She uses language that kids can easily grasp: \u201cLook for when blood puddles or when it rains like a sprinkler. The first step, take any cloth you can find and stuff a corner of it into the wound as deep as you can.\u201d She was teaching them the basic principles of packing a wound. On the day I was there, she told the kids they could\u00a0use anything to pack a wound, even a \u201cdirty, smelly sock.\u201d \u201cStopping the bleeding was most important, and they could give antibiotics later in the hospital to prevent infections,\u201d she said. \u201cDo whatever you can to just stop the bleed.\u201d It\u2019s the same kind of approach that pediatric trauma nurse Missy Anderson takes when she teaches Scout troops and children\u2019s groups in Denver. Anderson is the pediatric trauma program manager at Denver Health and describes the tourniquets as \u201cmagical bracelets\u201d \u2014 a concept that most kids can immediately understand. Carleton stopped bringing up gun violence after a handful of parents complained, but she doesn\u2019t shy away\u00a0when someone raises it.\u00a0In a sixth-grade class I visited, a student asked, if someone was shot in multiple places, where should they try to stop the bleed? Carleton answered quickly, \u201cWhere they are bleeding the most.\u201d \u201cI try to acknowledge the kids on where they\u2019re at,\u201d she told me. \u201cI acknowledge it and we move on so that we can continue to talk about how to get the bleeding to stop.\u201d But\u00a0the topic of gun violence\u00a0gives her pause. \u201cIt tugs at my heartstrings a little bit, for sure,\u201d she said. Like Carleton, Anderson keeps the focus on safety, not violence. \u201cWhat if no guns existed in the whole world? We wipe them all out, there\u2019s not a single gun in the whole universe? People still get hurt, and they still can have bleeding,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cThis course should not be affiliated with gun violence. This is about helping people that are bleeding in any scenario.\u201d The goal of the campaign has always been to train everyone, including children, said Dr. Kenji Inaba, chair of the Stop the Bleed Committee for the American College of Surgeons. Inaba said he taught his\u00a0now-teenage son, an avid mountain biker, how to pack a wound and use a tourniquet by the time he was 10 years old. \u201cHe\u2019s always in the middle of nowhere, by himself or with some friends, and I want him to know that knowledge.\u201d Inaba said that after discussion with pediatric surgeons, pediatricians and parents, the committee concluded that there really is no age limit on who should be taught these skills. \u201cEvery child is different in their development. Every child is different in their experience,\u201d he said. Inaba added that the group is in discussion with child development experts and teachers to create a curriculum for younger kids. Reaching kids where they are means designing education that meets not only their emotional needs but their physical needs. For example, Carleton explained to me that younger kids can more effectively put pressure and stop bleeding by using all of their body weight. She showed the kids how to put their knee directly on the wound. \u201cIt\u2019ll make it a little bit easier for you, and you won\u2019t get tired,\u201d she told them. I watched as she stood in front of the class and demonstrated how to apply pressure with a rubber dummy limb, the same kind used to train EMTs. Carleton explained that adults will typically use their hands and press down as hard as possible over a packed wound, \u201cbecause I\u2019m stronger than you,\u201d she said. One kid shouted out \u201cMom power!\u201d and the class giggled. Carleton then quickly divided the class into groups of four or five kids, led by volunteers from the fire department, to practice on dummy limbs. \u201cIf you were in that situation, do you think you could do it now? Does that make you nervous at all?\u201d I asked\u00a0Harlow, a third-grader. \u201cJust the feeling of how it would be an actual person instead of a fake leg. That\u2019s scary,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you think based on what you learned, if it was an actual person, you\u2019d be able to do that?\u201d\u00a0\ufeffI responded. \u201cYeah,\u201d Harlow responded confidently. Even young children know how to help Studies find that young people can learn lifesaving\u00a0lessons. Though they aren\u2019t as young as the students I visited, a 2019 study of high school students found that\u00a0more than 80%\u00a0of them were able to position a tourniquet correctly after being taught either in person or online. A small\u00a02022\u00a0study of 11- and 12-year-olds found that\u00a097% of the students\u00a0grasped the lessons of bleeding control and tourniquet use after Stop the Bleed training. A recent study from the\u00a0American Heart Association\u00a0found that children as young as 4 know how to call for help in a medical emergency and that by age 10 to 12, children can administer\u00a0effective\u00a0CPR. Harlow\u2019s classmate Jeremy told me that the best part of learning all of this was that he was prepared to help anyone. \u201cIt\u2019s that feeling you get when you get to see them go to the hospital and know that they\u2019re OK and the feeling that you\u2019ve saved someone\u2019s life,\u201d he said. And the lessons seem to stick with them. A sixth-grader, Piper, told me that although she would probably be nervous to apply these skills in a \u201creal situation\u201d when someone was \u201cactually bleeding out and there was a puddle,\u201d she was glad they had a trial run through the lessons in the classroom. \u201cIt kind of loosens things up and doesn\u2019t make things so scary.\u201d Carleton\u2019s daughter and Piper\u2019s classmate, Quinn, agreed. \u201cWhen a situation comes for something like this, it won\u2019t be as scary, since we know what to do because we\u2019ve already practiced it,\u201d she said. A new \u2018stop, drop and roll\u2019 As impressed as I was with how quick and engaged the kids were, I couldn\u2019t help but feel sad that this is where we are\u00a0as\u00a0a country. A time when tourniquets and bleeding control kits are as routine as \u201cstop, drop and roll,\u201d the fire safety instructions that generations of children have learned in their classrooms. When I shared that with Carleton, she told me that she felt the same way at first, but she had to change her approach. \u201cWhen I would initially go into that with that kind of feeling, I just found that I couldn\u2019t teach the information in a way that it really resonated with them. It was being taught out of fear from me, and I don\u2019t want that,\u201d she said. It is hard, however, to disentangle gun violence from the situations where these lessons could be most impactful. Gun violence has become such a prevalent part of American life, Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy has now issued an\u00a0advisory\u00a0calling firearm violence an urgent public health crisis. The advisory notes that half of children ages 14 to 17 worry about school shootings and nearly 60% of them have thought about \u201cwhat would happen if a person with a gun entered\u201d their school. According to the\u00a0Gun Violence Archive,\u00a0last year alone, 1,682 children died and another 4,512 were injured by gun violence. So a grass-roots movement to train elementary-age children continues, with people like Carleton leading the charge. \u201cWe can teach it, like teaching hands-only\u00a0CPR or how to use an AED. It just becomes part of what we do,\u201d Carleton told me. \u201cIt can be used in all situations, whether it\u2019s a violent situation or not. But either way, it\u2019s saving somebody\u2019s life.\u201d CNN\u2019s Nadia Kounang contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/health/gun-violence-stop-the-bleed-children-gupta/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_world_ancient-egyptian-skull-cancer-treatment-scn", "text": "Cancer is often regarded as a disease of the modern age. However, medical texts from ancient Egypt indicate that healers of the time were aware of the condition. Now, new evidence from a skull more than 4,000 years old\u00a0has revealed that ancient Egyptian physicians may have tried to treat certain cancers with surgery. The skull belonged to a man who was about 30 to 35 years old when he died, and it resides in the Duckworth Laboratory collection at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. Since the mid-19th century, scientists have studied the skull\u2019s scarred surface, including multiple lesions\u00a0thought to represent bone damage from malignant tumors. Archaeologists regard the skull, labeled 236 in the collection, as one of the oldest examples of malignancy in the ancient world, dating back to between 2686 BC\u00a0and 2345 BC. But when researchers recently peered more closely at the tumor scars with a digital microscope and micro-computed tomography (CT) scans, they detected signs of cut marks around the tumors, suggesting that sharp metal instruments had been used to remove the growths. The scientists reported the findings Wednesday in the journal Frontiers in Medicine. \u201cIt was the very first time that humanity was dealing surgically with what we nowadays call cancer,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Edgard Camar\u00f3s, a professor in the department of history at the University of Santiago de Compostela in Coru\u00f1a, Spain. However, it\u2019s unknown\u00a0whether the healers tried to remove the tumors while the patient was still alive, or if the tumors were removed after death, for analysis, Camar\u00f3s told CNN. \u201cIf those cut marks were done with that person alive, we\u2019re talking about some kind of treatment directly related to the cancer,\u201d he said. But if the cut marks were made posthumously, \u201cit means that this is a medical autopsy exploration in relation to that cancer.\u201d Either way, \u201cit\u2019s amazing to think that they performed a surgical intervention,\u201d Camar\u00f3s added. \u201cBut we cannot actually distinguish between a treatment and an autopsy.\u201d Medical \u2018knowledge and mastery\u2019 Medicine in ancient Egypt, documented extensively in medical texts such as the Ebers Papyrus and the Kahun Papyrus, was unquestionably sophisticated, and the new findings offer important, direct evidence of this knowledge, said Dr. Ibrahem Badr, an associate professor in the department of restoration and conservation of antiquities at Misr University for Science and Technology in Giza, Egypt. \u201cWe can see that ancient Egyptian medicine was not solely based on herbal remedies like medicine in other ancient civilizations,\u201d said Badr, who was not involved in the new research. \u201cIt directly relied on surgical practices.\u201d But while this evidence from antiquity was well studied during the 19th and 20th centuries, 21st\u00a0century technologies, such as those used in the new study, are revealing previously unknown details\u00a0about ancient Egypt\u2019s medical arts, Badr added. \u201cThe research provides a new and solid direction for reevaluating the history of medicine and pathology among ancient Egyptians,\u201d he said. The study authors\u2019 methods \u201ctransition their results from the realm of uncertainty and archaeological possibilities to the realm of scientific and medical certainty.\u201d The scientists also found cancer lesions in a second skull from the Duckworth collection. Labeled E270 and\u00a0dating from 664 BC\u00a0to 343 BC, it belonged to an adult woman who was at least 50 years old. The team identified three lesions on the specimen where malignant tumors had damaged the bone. Unlike skull 236, E270 showed no signs of surgery related to the disease. But the woman\u2019s skull\u00a0did contain long-healed fractures, showing the success of prior medical intervention for head injuries. \u201cThat person survived many years after that trauma,\u201d Camar\u00f3s said. Writing cancer\u2019s \u2018biography\u2019 The analysis of both skulls \u201cis a remarkable piece of research that provides new and clear scientific evidence about the field of pathology and the development of medicine among the ancient Egyptians,\u201d Badr said. Badr, who collaborates with scientists from Europe and the United\u00a0States to study atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in arterial walls) in ancient Egyptian mummies, explained that his work follows the same scientific direction as the skull investigation. By conducting detailed examinations of mummies using 21st century technologies such as CT scans and DNA sequencing, Badr and his colleagues hope to further illuminate the extent of medical knowledge in Egyptian antiquity. \u201cThere is an urgent need to reevaluate the history of Egyptian medicine using these scientific methodologies,\u201d Badr said. \u201cBy utilizing these modern techniques, we will be able to study and gain a more comprehensive and precise understanding of medicine in ancient Egypt.\u201d The new findings also help to complete a portion of cancer\u2019s \u201cobscure biography\u201d by adding a chapter that was written thousands of years ago, Camar\u00f3s added. \u201cThe more we look into our past, the more we know that cancer was much more prevalent, much more present than we thought,\u201d he said. A medical milestone Ancient Egyptians\u2019 perception of cancer centered around the visible tumors that the disease produced. The earliest recorded observation of cancer is in an ancient Egyptian medical text known as the Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus, which dates back to around 3000 BC to 2500 BC. This text contains 48 case studies covering diverse ailments, including one description of breast cancer. While healers in ancient Egypt may have been aware of cancer, treating it was another story. Most of the medical cases in the Edwin Smith\u00a0papyrus included mention of medicines or strategies for healing. But there was none for the breast cancer patient\u2019s tumors, Camar\u00f3s said. \u201cIt specifically says there\u2019s no treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cThey realized this was a frontier when it came to their medical knowledge.\u201d However, the incisions around the skull tumors suggest that healers in ancient Egypt were trying to change that, surgically removing the tumors to either heal the patient, or to examine the tumors more closely. \u201cWe have these two possibilities: in a way that they tried to treat it, or in a way that they tried to medically understand it, in terms of probably treating it in the future,\u201d Camar\u00f3s said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a milestone in the history of medicine.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/world/ancient-egyptian-skull-cancer-treatment-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_science_new-piranha-pacu-species-sauron-amazon-scn", "text": "Thousands of fish species \u2014 about 2,500 of them named\u00a0\u2014 call the Amazon River home, but scientists estimate nearly half of the marine creatures lurking in the massive stretch of water remain undiscovered. While studying piranhas and pacus in an effort to better assess vital fish biodiversity in the\u00a04,000-mile-long (6,400-kilometer-long)\u00a0river, an international team of researchers has found and identified a new species of pacu, a piranha relative with a plant-based diet and humanlike teeth. Besides its odd pearly whites, the newfound species has striking orange and black markings \u2014 including a bold vertical black bar stretching across its flank \u2014 that the researchers say resemble the fiery eye symbol for the villain Sauron from J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d book and film series. The marks inspired the fish\u2019s name, Myloplus sauron, according to\u00a0a study\u00a0published Monday in the journal Neotropical Ichthyology. \u201cMe and the coauthors thought (the name) would be a nice idea \u2014 it really looks like the Sauron\u2019s eye,\u201d said study coauthor Vict\u00f3ria Pereira, a graduate student in biology at the University of Paulista in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The researchers hoped the pop culture reference would draw attention to the fish and efforts to protect biodiversity in the Amazon, Pereira added. The eye-catching fish is not the only animal named for Tolkien\u2019s Dark Lord. A\u00a0genus of butterflies\u00a0was found in May 2023 with spots that looked like eyes on its wings, reminding researchers of the well-known symbol from the trilogy. There is also a species of\u00a0tree frog, a dung beetle and a\u00a0genus of dinosaurs\u00a0named after the character. The confusion around pacus Besides Myloplus sauron, the researchers also discovered the species Myloplus aylan, which they described as having a slightly thicker black bar on its flank. The Myloplus genus falls within the\u00a0Serrasalmidae\u00a0fish family, which is made up of piranha and pacu species. Because piranhas and pacus are closely related and have similar features, differentiating the species can be difficult, the authors noted in the study.\u00a0Both pacu and piranha species can change\u00a0appearance throughout various stages of their life, and males and females often look different from one another, also making the various species hard to tell apart, according to London\u2019s Natural History Museum. Myloplus sauron and Myloplus aylan have flat, blunt teeth used to chew on plants, a stark contrast with the razor-sharp teeth found in piranhas, but similar to their other pacu counterparts. While some species of piranhas are known for their carnivorous diets, all species of pacus are primarily herbivores. Previously, these two new species were grouped in with another fish, Myloplus schomburgkii, because of the shared design of the black mark on the fish\u2019s round body. However, through closer inspection and DNA analysis, researchers found three different species shared the eye-catching design. Researchers hope to study Myloplus sauron and Myloplus aylan further to learn more about their evolution and relation to other species, Pereira said. \u201cPeople studying pacus have recognized for a while that there were multiple species \u2018hiding in plain sight,\u2019\u201d said Matthew Kolmann, an assistant professor in the department of biology at the University of Louisville in Kentucky, who has studied the fish. He was not involved with the new study. \u201cThe size of the Amazon and other basins, and their inaccessibility, makes it a place of constant discovery,\u201d Kolmann said in an email. \u201cWhat this means is that it has and will continue to take generations of scientists\u2019 effort to increase our knowledge of the area.\u201d Pacus\u2019 impact on their ecosystem Pacus are important to their ecosystem largely due to their role in spreading seeds through their diet of mostly fruit, which make them vital for the growth of rainforest trees and other plants. The fish tend to spread seeds far from their parent plants, helping to expand the forest and limit disease that easily spreads through crowded trees, Kolmann said. By discovering and identifying the species that live in certain ecosystems, researchers will be able to better lead conservation efforts to protect animals that are endangered or at risk, Kolmann said. It is particularly important for areas such as the Amazon that are under threat from\u00a0habitat destruction,\u00a0he added. \u201cWe run the very real risk of losing thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of species before we know they even exist, and by proxy, not ever understanding how these species contribute to a healthy functioning ecosystem,\u201d Kolmann said. \u201cInventorying what species are found where, and when, is the first step in any future conservation effort.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/science/new-piranha-pacu-species-sauron-amazon-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_health_surgeon-general-gun-violence-advisory", "text": "Gun violence in the United States is a public health crisis that demands urgent action, Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy declared in a major new advisory that pushes for more research and stronger laws designed to reduce harm. It\u2019s the first time a publication from the country\u2019s leading voice for public health\u00a0has\u00a0focused on firearm violence and its \u201cprofound consequences\u201d on survivors, communities, and mental health. \u201cOver the last decade or two, this problem has been worsening and we have now reached the point where gun violence is the leading cause of death among kids and teens \u2013 the leading cause of death. That is something that we should never take as the new normal. There\u2019s nothing normal about that,\u201d Murthy told CNN\u2019s John Berman. Guns have become a deeply polarizing issue, Murthy said, but the advisory is meant to \u201ctake it out of the realm of politics and put it into the realm of public health, which is where it belongs.\u201d The advisory lays out key preventive steps and regulatory measures that Murthy says can turn the tide on gun violence \u2014 just as they did for tobacco-related disease and motor vehicle crashes. \u201cMany people I\u2019ve talked to around the country worry that this may be an intractable problem, that there\u2019s no way to solve it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d Record-breaking level of gun deaths Tuesday\u2019s advisory spells out how devastating gun violence has been in the United States and details how public health strategies can help. \u201cWe\u2019ve experienced so many mass shootings, so many incidents of gun violence in our neighborhoods and communities, that it has really pervaded the psyche of our country. It has induced fear in people about regular day-to-day activities, like going to the grocery store, going to school, going to work,\u201d Murthy said. In 2022 alone, more than 48,000 people in the US died from firearm-related injuries,\u00a0according to provisional data.\u00a0That number included homicides, suicides and unintentional deaths. The rate of firearm-related deaths in the US has been rising,\u00a0according to the advisory, reaching a three-decade high in 2021. Since then, data has shown a decrease in gun-related homicides, while the number of gun-related suicides have stayed about the same, the advisory says. While mass shootings are still rare, making up just about 1% of gun deaths, the number of mass shooting incidents has been rising, according to the advisory. A\u00a0KFF poll in April last year\u00a0also showed that gun violence is all too common in the lives of Americans. More than half of adults that live in the US report that they or their loved ones have experienced a firearm-related incident. One in five adults say they have personally been threatened with a gun, and nearly the same number said that a family member was killed by a gun. That last number included those who used a gun in a suicide. People of color are disproportionately impacted by gun violence, the\u00a0surgeon\u00a0general\u2019s advisory says. In 2022, Black people saw the highest rates of firearm-related homicides across all ages. That same year,\u00a0Black children and adolescents made up half of all firearm deaths, despite being only 14% of this demographic, the advisory says. The violence isn\u2019t just a direct physical threat:\u00a0It can threaten an entire communities\u2019 sense of well-being and can lead to elevated levels of stress and mental health problems. Children\u00a0ages\u00a01 to 19\u00a0die from guns\u00a0more\u00a0than anything else in the US,\u00a0studies show. Children, in general, faced the highest gun violence mortality rate among peer countries by far.\u00a0In the US,\u00a0there were 36.4 deaths per million people ages 1\u00a0to\u00a019;\u00a0in Canada, its 6.2 per million, in Australia, it\u2019s 1.6 per million and in the UK, it\u2019s 0.5 per million. An analysis of unintentional firearm deaths among children and adolescents found that 56% of these incidents happened in the child\u2019s own home. Part of the problem is the way firearms are kept: Among the incidents where the details were known, 74% of the firearms were stored loaded and 76% were stored unlocked. Most commonly, guns were found in sleeping areas, such as in nightstands, under a pillow or mattress or on a bed. In addition to the physical problems such violence can cause, firearm violence can also take a toll on mental health, the advisory says. Fears about gun violence are particularly common among children, the advisory says, and many worry that they will experience such violence at school. Public health leaders will have to address the country\u2019s high suicide rate, according to the advisory. More than half of gun deaths in 2022, 56%, were from suicide. Unlike with homicides, the highest rate of gun suicides for adults 45 years and older involved White people. For younger people, those who identified as American Indian or Alaska Native had the highest rate of gun suicides. In\u00a02021, the suicide rate for men who are veterans\u00a0was 62.4% higher\u00a0than for men who are not veterans. It was 281.1% higher for women who\u00a0are veterans\u00a0compared\u00a0with\u00a0women who\u00a0are not. A public health approach to gun violence The advisory\u00a0says\u00a0more money needs to be dedicated to firearms\u00a0research to understand how to reduce and prevent firearm violence in the US, and investments must\u00a0target better data collection and prevention strategies. The advisory urges communities and health-care systems to step up to help populations that are particularly vulnerable to this kind of violence. The advisory also calls for more gun laws, including\u00a0requirements for safe and secure firearm storage, a ban on assault weapons, universal background checks and effective firearm removal policies. It also says firearms should be\u00a0treated\u00a0like any other regulated consumer products,\u00a0such as\u00a0cars or pesticides. \u201cThere are no federal standards or regulations regarding the safety of firearms produced in the US,\u201d the advisory says. \u201cFirearms manufactured and sold in the US may not undergo safety testing or include safety features like warning labels related to associated risk or authorized-use technology (\u201csmart\u201d firearm technology) for firearm access. Treating firearms as a consumer product could result in changes which may enhance safety.\u201d Gun advocates pushed back against the report. In a tweet, the NRA said \u201cThis is an extension of the Biden Administration\u2019s war on law-abiding gun owners. America has a crime problem caused by criminals.\u201d Gun violence prevention advocates welcomed the attention this advisory would bring to the issue. \u201cThis advisory not only sounds the alarm for all Americans, but it signals there must be greater investments in research and violence prevention solutions,\u201d said Dr. Joseph V. Sakran, Brady board chair and chief medical officer\u00a0in an email. Sakran, a survivor of gun violence and trauma surgeon who leads the group that has been advocating for more of a public health response to gun violence for years, labeled the advisory \u201cgroundbreaking.\u201d \u201cHistorically, we have seen how the release of Surgeon General reports on public health issues such as the dangers of smoking ignited a wave of policy, legal, and public health initiatives that saved countless American lives and in this case led to deprogramming our nation from the tobacco industry\u2019s lies. We hope this report will have the same resounding impact on the gun violence epidemic.\u201d The American Psychological Association also applauded the effort to put gun violence \u201cfront and center\u201d on American minds. \u201cThe picture is appalling,\u201d Arthur C. Evans Jr, the CEO of the American Psychological Association said in a news release. \u201cThe impact of gun violence reverberates across communities, leading to collective trauma, stress, and anxiety.\u201d This is not the first advisory Murthy has issued. A 2021 advisory detailed the spate of\u00a0mental health problems\u00a0people faced, and a separate advisory explained how Americans could confront a rash of\u00a0health misinformation.\u00a0Last year, Murthy issued another advisory on the effects of social media on youth mental health. \u201cIt is up to us to take on this generational challenge with the urgency and clarity the moment demands,\u201d the advisory says. \u201cThe safety and well-being of our children and future generations are at stake.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/health/surgeon-general-gun-violence-advisory/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_science_strawberry-full-moon-june-scn", "text": "Despite its name, June\u2019s full moon will not look like a strawberry. But the bright orb could still turn heads Friday night with an appearance that is bigger and more colorful than the average moon. The full moon \u2014 which will reach the crest of its fullness\u00a0at 9:08\u00a0p.m. ET Friday\u00a0\u2014 comes one day after the\u00a0summer solstice, the day of the year when the sun appears the highest in the sky for the Northern Hemisphere. Since a full moon is opposite the sun, this strawberry moon will shine lower in the sky than usual, according to\u00a0NASA. Because of this \u201clower than average path across the sky,\u201d the full moon could have an \u201corange- or amber-colored appearance, for the same reason sunsets appear orange or reddish,\u201d said Preston Dyches, a science communicator with NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, in an email. Dyches said the effect is the result of the moon\u2019s reflected light having to travel a longer distance throughout Earth\u2019s atmosphere, scattering away most blue wavelengths (which are shorter than red wavelengths). Native American tribes across North America gave the strawberry moon its name to mark the in-season ripeness of strawberries, according to\u00a0The Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac. The moon\u2019s low placement in the sky could also cause the orb to appear bigger than usual, according to\u00a0NASA,\u00a0due to an effect dubbed the moon illusion. Scientists don\u2019t really know why this optical illusion happens, but it\u2019s believed to be a combination of how our brain processes visual information and the moon\u2019s size in comparison with smaller objects near the horizon, such as trees or the roofs of houses. For optimal viewing, Dyches recommends looking when the moon is rising or setting to see the effects of the moon illusion. No equipment is needed to view a full moon, but a telescope or pair of binoculars could enhance its features, according to\u00a0NASA\u2019s Moon Viewing Guide. \u201cWhenever something beautiful about the natural world can be experienced from your doorstep, it\u2019s worth a few minutes of your time,\u201d Dyches said. \u201cIt\u2019s rewarding to marvel at the sight of another giant world. \u2026 I like to gaze up and think of it as a place people will live and work someday.\u201d How to see the \u2018Summer Triangle\u2019 in the night sky Because the moon appears full for three days a month surrounding its peak, the strawberry moon will be visible to almost everyone worldwide. However, it will be more difficult to observe for those farther north, such as in Alaska or Denmark, where the low-traversing moon will only briefly rise above the horizon, Dyches said. Besides the full moon, those in the Northern Hemisphere can spot the \u201cSummer Triangle,\u201d an arrangement of three bright stars whose presence in the sky symbolizes summertime in the north, said Dyches, who also produces the space agency\u2019s monthly sky-watching highlights video called \u201cWhat\u2019s Up.\u201d To find the triangular pattern, it is easiest to look for the brightest of the three stars, Vega, which will be near the east in the sky, according to EarthSky.

{"id": "2024_06_19_health_children-screen-time-guilt-wellness", "text": "The intersection of kids and screen time is causing quite a stir among parents, experts and even the US Surgeon General (who wants social media apps labeled) these days. Earlier this year, a New York University social psychologist published a best-selling book about the supposed dangers of smart phones and social media for kids before a certain age. Others have responded saying screen time isn\u2019t so bad\u2014so long as it\u2019s in moderation. But what about the guilt parents feel from letting their kids use screens? That\u2019s the subject of recent research by Dr. Nathan Walter, associate professor of media psychology at Northwestern University, and two coauthors. Their research focused parental guilt over letting their kids use screens more than developmental psychologists say they should. The research was published earlier this year in the journal Media Psychology. Not surprisingly, parents who feel guilty about their kids\u2019 screen use are more stressed and less likely to report positive relationships with their kids, according to the data. The research also suggested that it\u2019s important to take a closer look at the science behind claims about the negative impact of screens\u2014since some studies show correlation but not causation. CNN recently talked with Walter about his research, how parents can change their thinking about kids\u2019 screen use, and the impact of screen time guilt on the family system. This conversation has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity CNN: At a time when experts are clamoring for less screen time, what inspired you to look into the idea of parental guilt? Dr. Nathan Walter: I have two kids, and when my oldest was born, we followed all the recommendations, no screen time until a certain age. When she was a little bit older, around 2, we used to sit with her and watch and explain and mediate everything to her. When my son was born a few years later, we were just at a different place, a bit busier, a bit more tired, and he was exposed to screens much more than she was, especially early on. I felt enormous guilt\u2014like I was failing as a parent. I also felt like a hypocrite because, as a communications professor, I was teaching classes on media effects, and here I\u2019m presenting on the negative effects of screen use to my students who are 18, 19 and 20 years old. My coauthors had similar experiences. Because we also study emotions, my coauthors and I were interested to know what\u2019s the role that guilt plays in the negative effects of screen time. One of the things we found: Most of the evidence that we have around screen use is correlational. It\u2019s just associations with social problems, obesity and lower academic performance. It\u2019s difficult to know whether screen use actually causes all these issues. And the fact that two things are associated could simply mean that there\u2019s a third factor involved, such as, say, socioeconomic status. If your parents work three jobs, they don\u2019t have a lot of time to spend with you at home, so you are with screens and also your academic performance may suffer. Covid was a great opportunity to examine the effects of screen time and the idea that emotions could play a bigger role. CNN: As you looked deeper into the impact of screen time on kids, what did you find? Walter: Associations don\u2019t allow researchers to make causal inferences. More important, the perfect study does not exist. If you want to cherry-pick evidence, the literature is so broad that you\u2019ll be able to find anything that you want. This is why the greatest value that we have in terms of evidence comes from what we call meta-analyses. A recent meta-analysis looked at 18 cohort studies with almost 250,000 participants. They wanted to know the relationship between screen time and depression, which is one of the major concerns that we have around screen time. They found no meaningful relationship there. Certain subgroups, certain ages, certain screens\u2014there was connection some of the time, but not all the time, and not across the board. Another meta-analysis looked at the relationship between screen time and executive functioning skills. This one was 7,000 kids. There was absolutely no relationship between these cognitive problems and screen use. Every time we looked into it, there was association but not causation. Another meta-analysis had 100,000 participants and looked at academic performance. Again, many different ages, many different screens, many different kids and absolutely no relationship between screen time and academic performance across all these studies. If you isolate video games among certain ages, that is negatively associated with academic performance, but these are not the little kids that we think about when we\u2019re thinking about screen use. So that tells us that it\u2019s a little bit more complicated. CNN: What do you think is happening? Walter: There\u2019s nothing inherently negative about screen time or screen use, but just like any other media, it displaces other activities. So, when you\u2019re at home with your screen, you\u2019re not outside making social relationships with kids. When you\u2019re at home with your screen, you\u2019re not in the playground playing. Again, this is more about the replacement\u2014the trade-offs between screen use and other activities that generate many of the negative effects we see\u2014as opposed to something more inherent. If this is the case and we need to understand this in a broader context of trade-offs, why not consider also emotional trade-offs? This is basically our research. Let\u2019s look at the emotional trade-offs that happen because of how stigmatized screen use has become in our society. CNN: Dr. Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist at New York University, recently published a book encouraging parents to keep their kids off phones completely until the age of 13. How do you reconcile your findings with those recommendations? Walter: Some screens may have some effects on some children some of the time. And it\u2019s true that if you want to isolate specific groups, specific media and specific content, you can always find those effects. It\u2019s also true that if we zoom out a little bit more and understand that screen use happens in a particular context, I think the emotional effects are also very important. I don\u2019t want to create an atmosphere where screen use for kids is perceived to be uniformly bad and negative. I don\u2019t like to look at the issue of screen use as binary, as acceptable or not acceptable. I\u2019m just advocating for a little bit more nuance in how we talk about the negative associations. Our findings don\u2019t really challenge what (Dr. Haidt) is saying. Our findings are more about the certainty with which these things are being said and the perception that it creates in the public about screens. What we see in our research is that screen time has almost no effect on parent-child relationship satisfaction, which has been shown to be associated with health and other important factors. Yet parents still feel guilty when their kids use screens. CNN: How can parents stave off that guilt? How can parents approach screen time for their kids with a different perspective? Walter: It\u2019s important to note that all these meta-analyses that I mentioned earlier find basically no effects for thresholds. So, time limits (with screens) are not a factor. Each family is going to have a different threshold anyway. In our study\u2014and again, the context was Covid\u2014data indicated we were all basically just glued to our screens, including our kids. The average that we saw in terms of daily use was around four hours. Was that (amount of time) good? Was that bad? That\u2019s not exactly what the study was about. The study was about parent-child relationship satisfaction. We did not see screens impacting that. Yet living in this reality where, as a parent, you constantly feel like screens are terrible and you are a bad parent if your kids use screens\u2014that can weigh on you. If you\u2019re a parent and you\u2019re feeling guilty, try to read more about screens and their effects. Try to read more balanced and transparent reviews that say, \u2018There\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know,\u2019 and, \u2018There\u2019s so much uncertainty around this issue. Although you can cherry-pick a study or 10 studies that show exactly what you want to show\u2014for or against screen use\u2014when you get the bird\u2019s eye view of the entire corpus of work, there\u2019s just so many questions. To think of screens as something that is inherently negative is not very accurate. CNN: What is the trickle-down impact of parents feeling guilt over screen time? Walter: We started this research hypothesizing that increased screen use by kids would increase the amount of guilt felt by parents, and that, in turn, will have a negative effect on the parent-child dynamic. But what we found time and time again is that the amount of screen time in terms of hours has very little influence on guilt. It\u2019s almost like guilt is divorced from the actual number of hours. As parents, we just feel bad about it. CNN: What\u2019s the prescription here? How can parents manage this guilt? Walter: The prescription is not so much about how much screen you should or shouldn\u2019t let your kids use, but rather how we should talk about screen time. Let\u2019s not stigmatize kids who use screens. Let\u2019s not stigmatize parents who allow their kids to use screens.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/health/children-screen-time-guilt-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_health_social-media-mental-health-limited-science-wellness", "text": "When US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy pushed last week for a tobacco-style warning on social media, he called the mental\u00a0health\u00a0crisis in young people an emergency that demanded action without waiting for \u201cperfect information.\u201d Even among experts, questions remain about the exact role that social media plays in the mental\u00a0health\u00a0of children and teens. Authors of a sweeping new review of research into social media and mental\u00a0health\u00a0say there\u2019s still key information missing to know whether prevention programs and interventions will work. In the study, published Monday in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics, researchers reviewed nearly 150 studies on the relationship between social media and the mental health of adolescents. They found an overall link between anxiety and depression in adolescents and the time spent on social media platforms, as well as a link between the types of activities and content they were interacting with. However, the level of impact varied enough to suggest that the findings shouldn\u2019t be generalized to the population as a whole. The researchers found that very few studies assessed the relationship between social media use and adolescents who were experiencing mental health symptoms at clinical levels \u2014 where they\u2019re seeking health services or have an active diagnosis, for example \u2014 which further clouds the findings. There\u2019s a \u201creal risk that we are incorrectly generalizing results from the general population to young people with mental\u00a0health\u00a0conditions,\u201d wrote the study authors, from the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom and Stellenbosch University in South Africa. \u201cIn a world increasingly saturated by digital technology, we cannot afford to design prevention programs, interventions, and regulations without knowing that they work for everyone, especially those who are most vulnerable.\u201d Another analysis of existing research, published by National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in December, also highlighted key questions that remain to be answered. \u201cThere is not enough evidence to say that social media causes changes in adolescent health at the population level,\u201d according to a news release from the independent organization about the report. And \u201cdespite many years of research, the evidence clarifying precisely how social media influences health is limited.\u201d While the science suggests there is a link between social media and mental health, there is often a lack of clarity on whether social media is influencing an individual\u2019s mental health or whether an individual\u2019s mental health is influencing their use of social media, said Dr. Sandro Galea, chair of an ad-hoc National Academies committee that authored the analysis of research and dean of the Boston University School of Public Health. Future research should focus on following trends over time \u2013 tracking the mental health of the same children before and after exposure to social media to see what effects it has \u2013 and digging in on more specific measures that capture how social media is used, he said. For Murthy, the urgency of the youth mental health crisis is dominant \u2014\u00a0and there\u2019s enough evidence to act now. In a New York Times op-ed, Murthy advocated for a warning label that would \u201cregularly remind parents and adolescents that social media has not been proved safe\u201d among other interventions. Murthy cited two key reports in support of a warning label: one study from 2019 that found that adolescents who spent more time on social media faced increased risk for anxiety and depression and one survey from 2022 in which nearly half of adolescents said that social media makes them feel worse about their bodies. \u201cOne of the most important lessons I learned in medical school was that in an emergency, you don\u2019t have the luxury to wait for perfect information. You assess the available facts, you use your best judgment, and you act quickly,\u201d Murthy wrote in his essay. \u201cThe mental health crisis among young people is an emergency \u2014 and social media has emerged as an important contributor.\u201d Public health often lacks \u2018perfect\u2019 data Many experts agree that the surgeon general is starting an important conversation and that the need for more information shouldn\u2019t lead to passiveness, but a social media warning label will require nuance in language and implementation. It will also require Congress to act to make it a reality. \u201cThe Surgeon General is identifying something that he sees as a challenge to the health of the public and thinking about ways to act to mitigate the challenge. Through that lens, I think he\u2019s doing exactly what a surgeon general should do,\u201d Galea said. \u201cPublic health action, not infrequently, has to happen absent complete or perfect data.\u201d The National Academies committee specifically recommended against a social media ban. Despite potential harms \u2013 such as unhealthy social comparisons and distracting from other important healthy behaviors such as sleep, exercise and studying \u2013 social media can also benefit young people by helping to foster connection with friends and family, and with online support communities. But there is an important distinction between benefits and safety, Murthy said Friday on The Daily, a podcast from the the New York Times. \u201cIt\u2019s important to look at the research question broadly. What we\u2019re trying to understand first and foremost is the answer to the question parents are asking us, which is, \u2018Is social media safe from my kids?\u2019 And if you ask researchers, \u2018What does data tell us about safety? Where is the data that tells us these platforms are safe?\u2019 That data is not there. So there\u2019s not evidence of safety. There is growing evidence of harm,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are certain benefits, but getting some benefits does not justify forcing kids to endure significant harm.\u201d Still, social media is not the same as cigarettes. Smoking has a much stronger and more direct link with negative health effects, and cessation is not the end goal with social media. Instead, a social media warning label should be more like those on bicycles and motor vehicles, said Pamela Wisniewski, an associate professor in human-computer interaction at Vanderbilt University, whose research has focused on the relationship between social media, privacy, and online safety for adolescents. \u201cThe key is to focus on solutions that empower youth and give them choices and opportunities to maximize the benefits of social media use, while minimizing risks, as opposed to taking restrictive and surveillance-based approaches that are heavily rooted in fear,\u201d she said. The goal should be to ensure proper use, not just focus on the risks and harm. There is an expectation that products children interact with are tested for safety, and a warning label on social media could deliver a clear message that there are \u201ca lot of safety gaps,\u201d said Dr. Jenny\u00a0Radesky, co-medical director of the American Academy of Pediatrics Center of Excellence on Social Media and Youth Mental Health. \u201cWe expect that infant formula is tested for bacteria, toys are tested for lead paint, and that there are rules about safety for everything from cribs to cars. These safety guardrails that prioritize children\u2019s well-being in digital products do not exist in the US,\u201d she said. Still, warning labels are brief and nuance can be lost in the \u201cnoise of the internet,\u201d Radesky said. \u201cFamily conversations to support healthy media use take a long time and need to happen over and over.\u201d For the surgeon general, a warning label is part of a holistic strategy to reduce the risks that social media poses to young people in the US. Systematic design changes by the platforms and legislation to support those changes remain the priority. \u201cTo be clear, a warning label would not, on its own, make social media safe for young people,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThese harms are not a failure of willpower and parenting; they are the consequence of unleashing powerful technology without adequate safety measures, transparency or accountability.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/health/social-media-mental-health-limited-science-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_health_telling-lies-partner-content-wellness", "text": "Prominent cases of purported lying continue to dominate the news cycle. President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden was\u00a0found guilty of lying on a government form\u00a0while purchasing a handgun. Republican Representative George Santos\u00a0allegedly lied in many ways, including to donors through a third party in order to misuse the funds raised. The rapper Offset\u00a0admitted to lying on Instagram\u00a0about his wife, Cardi B, being unfaithful. There are a number of variables that distinguish these cases. One is the audience: the faceless government, particular donors and millions of online followers, respectively. Another is the medium used to convey the alleged lie: on a bureaucratic form, through intermediaries and via social media. Differences like these lead researchers like me to wonder what factors influence the telling of lies. Does a personal connection increase or decrease the likelihood of sticking to the truth? Are lies more prevalent on text or email than on the phone or in person? An emerging body of empirical research is trying to answer these questions, and some of the findings are surprising. They hold lessons, too - for how to think about the areas of your life where you might be more prone to tell lies, and also about where to be most cautious in trusting what others are saying. As the recent director of\u00a0The Honesty Project\u00a0and author of \u201cHonesty: The Philosophy and Psychology of a Neglected Virtue,\u201d I am especially interested in whether most people tend to be honest or not. READ MORE: Are people lying more since the rise of social media? Figuring out the frequency of lies Most research on lying asks participants to self-report their lying behavior, say during the past day or week. (Whether you can trust liars to tell the truth about lying is another question.) The classic study on lying frequency was conducted by psychologist\u00a0Bella DePaulo\u00a0in the mid-1990s. It focused on face-to-face interactions and used a group of student participants and another group of volunteers from the community around the University of Virginia. The community members\u00a0averaged one lie per day, while the students averaged two lies per day. This result became the benchmark finding in the field of honesty research and helped lead to an assumption among many researchers\u00a0that lying is commonplace. But averages do not describe individuals. It could be that each person in the group tells one or two lies per day. But it\u2019s also possible that there are some people who lie voraciously and others who lie very rarely. In an influential 2010 study, this second scenario is indeed what Michigan State University communication researcher\u00a0Kim Serota\u00a0and his colleagues found. Out of 1,000 American participants,\u00a059.9% claimed not to have told a single lie\u00a0in the past 24 hours. Of those who admitted they did lie, most said they\u2019d told very few lies. Participants reported 1,646 lies in total, but half of them came from just 5.3% of the participants. This general pattern in the\u00a0data has been replicated\u00a0several times. Lying tends to be rare, except in the case of a small group of frequent liars. READ MORE: Watching children learn how to lie Does the medium make a difference? Might lying become more frequent under various conditions? What if you don\u2019t just consider face-to-face interactions, but introduce some distance by communicating via text, email or the phone? Research suggests the medium doesn\u2019t matter much. For instance, a 2014 study by Northwestern University communication researcher\u00a0Madeline Smith\u00a0and her colleagues found that when participants were asked to look at their 30 most recent text messages,\u00a023% said there were no deceptive texts. For the rest of the group, the vast majority said that 10% or fewer of their texts contained lies. Recent research by David Markowitz\u00a0at the University of Oregon successfully replicated earlier findings that had compared the\u00a0rates of lying using different technologies. Are lies more common on text, the phone or on email? Based on survey data from 205 participants, Markowitz found that on average, people\u00a0told 1.08 lies per day, but once again with the distribution of lies skewed by some frequent liars. Not only were the percentages fairly low, but the differences between the frequency with which lies were told via different media were not large. Still, it might be surprising to find that, say, lying on video chat was more common than lying face-to-face, with lying on email being least likely. A couple of\u00a0factors could be playing a role. Recordability seems to rein in the lies \u2013 perhaps knowing that the communication leaves a record raises worries about detection and makes lying less appealing. Synchronicity seems to matter too. Many lies occur in the heat of the moment, so it makes sense that when there\u2019s a delay in communication, as with email, lying would decrease. READ MORE: The truth about reading body language\u00a0 Does the audience change things? In addition to the medium, does the intended receiver of a potential lie make any difference? Initially you might think that people are more inclined to lie to strangers than to friends and family, given the impersonality of the interaction in the one case and the bonds of care and concern in the other. But matters are a bit more complicated. In her classic work, DePaulo found that people tend to tell what she called \u201ceveryday lies\u201d\u00a0more often to strangers than family members. To use her examples, these are smaller lies like \u201ctold her (that) her muffins were the best ever\u201d and \u201cexaggerated how sorry I was to be late.\u201d For instance, DePaulo and her colleague Deborah Kashy reported that participants in one of their studies lied\u00a0less than once per 10 social interactions\u00a0with spouses and children. However, when it came to serious lies about things like affairs or injuries, for instance, the pattern flipped. Now,\u00a053% of serious lies were to close partners\u00a0in the study\u2019s community participants, and the proportion jumped up to 72.7% among student volunteers. Perhaps not surprisingly, in these situations people might value not damaging their relationships more than they value the truth. Other data also finds participants tell\u00a0more lies to friends and family members\u00a0than to strangers. READ MORE: With so many people speaking \u2018their truth\u2019, how do we know what the truth really is?\u00a0 Investigating the truth about lies It is worth emphasizing that these are all initial findings. Further replication is needed, and cross-cultural studies using non-Western participants are scarce. Additionally, there are many other variables that could be examined, such as age, gender, religion and political affiliation. When it comes to honesty, though, I find the results, in general, promising. Lying seems to happen rarely for many people, even toward strangers and even via social media and texting. Where people need to be especially discerning, though, is in identifying \u2013 and avoiding \u2013 the small number of rampant liars out there. If you\u2019re one of them yourself, maybe you never realized that you\u2019re actually in a small minority.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/health/telling-lies-partner-content-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "health"}}
