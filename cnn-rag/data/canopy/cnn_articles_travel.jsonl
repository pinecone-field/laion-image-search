{"id": "travel_dubai-party-jet-fly-five", "text": "A lot of habits picked up in the pandemic era have stuck around. For most of us, that means grabbing Ubers when we could take the subway, or ordering food rather than walking to the store. For the super-rich, however, those convenient little time-saves now include ditching scheduled flights for trips on private jets. The global private aviation sector has been growing year on year since 2020 and the United Arab Emirates, no stranger to wealth and glitz, is spearheading the boom. One unique offering out of Dubai is the 9H-FIVE party jet, launched in 2023 by luxury hotel brand FIVE, which has three on-the-ground properties in Dubai. The aircraft is an ACJ TwoTwenty, Airbus\u2019 new business jet in partnership with Comlux. And while private planes might typically be decked out in corporate beige, the offering here focuses not on business but pleasure. LED lighting adjusts for mood in the 16-seat cabin kitted out with electro-chromatic window shades, two 55-inch TV screens, an in-flight sound system with the availability of a specially curated playlist, smart technology touchscreens, high-speed Wi-Fi, and plenty of space to dance. The jet has an impressive 12-hour non-stop flying time, which would comfortably cover a jaunt from Dubai to London or to Tokyo, for example. When guests get hungry, there\u2019s a fully equipped kitchen and a dining table for eight, with a choice of menus from FIVE\u2019s hotel restaurants. The cabin is a generous 78.1 by 10.8 feet (23.8 by 3.3 meters), with a height of 6.6 feet (two meters). Finally, there is of course also a Master Suite with a king-size bed and on-board shower, for refreshing before landing. All this extravagance is available to FLY FIVE guests, or anyone else who wishes to hire the jet, for around $15,000 an hour, which is admittedly a good bit less than buying a $100 million ACJ TwoTwenty themselves. VIPs and heads of state Chartered flights are a key part of this private aviation boom, as a more affordable way of achieving that exclusive experience \u2013 although still big dollars. FLY FIVE has told CNN that since officially beginning operations in April 2023, 9H-FIVE has been booked more than 50 times, with customers including VIPs and heads of state, chartering flights across Europe, USA, UK, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. This private aviation boom has occurred despite criticism from environmental groups that private jets are a disproportionally large contributor to global carbon dioxide emissions, with shorter flights being less efficient and the emissions per passenger much higher. FLY FIVE tells CNN it offsets its annual emissions by purchasing Nature-Based Carbon Credits, supporting rainforest preservation and reforestation, and aims to renew its offsetting activities annually. It\u2019s also been certified by\u00a0 Climate Offset Certification (COC), which promotes carbon offset transaction transparency. CelestialSTAR is a concept cabin design for Boeing's BBJ 777-9 - the private jet version of Boeing's 777X. Elsewhere in the private jet space, at last year\u2019s Dubai Air Show Lufthansa Technik unveiled a new cabin design for the upcoming BBJ 777-9 \u2014 the private jet version of Boeing\u2019s new widebody aircraft, the 777X. The design, called CelestialSTAR, has as its centerpiece the largest rain and massage shower ever built on an aircraft, which can merge with the bedroom (with kingsize bed, of course) for a fully private retreat. The BBJ 777-9 will be the world\u2019s largest twin-engine private jet, with about 3,700 square feet of cabin space (343 square meters), and the plane can fly nonstop for 22 hours. That means it could connect any two cities in the world without stopovers, according to Boeing. The cost, though, of this state-of-the-art new plane and its custom interior racks up to about half a billion dollars, so it\u2019s purely an option for the ultra-ultra rich. There is one more budget option for those wishing to party on a plane, however. A decommissioned British Airways 747 is available for $1,300 an hour at Cotswold Airport in England, although it doesn\u2019t move an inch and never departs terra firma. Owner Suzannah Harvey told CNN in 2022, \u201cIt\u2019s a very versatile events facility, so it can accommodate anything from a kid\u2019s birthday party, through to a new product launch or a corporate presentation.\u201d The whole of the aircraft even has a wedding license. Said Harvey, \u201cSo you can get married in the cockpit if you want.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/dubai-party-jet-fly-five/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "travel"}}

The town council reminded beachgoers in a news release Wednesday that under the Municipal Ordinance of Use and Management of the Coast, they are prohibited from installing items such as chairs, hammocks and beach umbrellas before 9 a.m. in order not to hinder the clean-up of the beaches. Those who do not comply with this rule face being reported, their belongings being removed and fines of \u20ac250 euros (around $270). Chairs, hammocks and umbrellas that are left unattended for more than three hours during the day may be removed, the council said. It added that it has received complaints for some years now about people reserving space on the beach, with visitors arriving mid-morning to find it already staked out with belongings but no sign of their owners. The issue of space-hogging beachgoers is also a daily problem in nearby holiday hotspot Benidorm, according to local news site Informaci\u00f3n. Over the past few months, there has been increasing pushback against holidaymakers in Spain and its islands. Last month, the government of Barcelona \u2013 where thousands have been protesting against mass tourism \u2013 announced that it will bar apartment rentals to tourists by 2028, as it seeks to rein in soaring housing costs and make the city liveable for residents. In May, there were further crackdowns on party boats and public drinking on the islands of Ibiza and Mallorca. And in April, locals in the Canary Islands protested against excessive tourism, blaming visitors for pricing them out of their homes and causing environmental damage.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/travel/calpe-fine-sunbed-hoggers-spain-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_400-tourists-lord-howe-island-australia", "text": "Lord Howe Island has the look of a destination ripe for overtourism, with verdant mountaintops, pristine white-sand beaches and clear-blue waters teeming with colorful fish. Yet on this island of around 400 people, located 372 miles off the east coast of mainland Australia, the beaches are empty. The only sounds on a hike through its rainforests and mountains come from the wildlife. \u201cIt\u2019s what is not here that provides that experience \u2013 that is why it\u2019s so unique,\u201d said Lisa Makiiti, a sixth-generation islander who runs the boutique accommodation Bowker Beach House. There\u2019s \u201cvalue of having somewhere in the world that works in the reverse to every other tourist destination. It\u2019s not bigger and better and more and more.\u201d The secret to that unspoiled landscape is a tactic used in very few other places: limiting the number of tourists who can visit at all. For over 40 years, Lord Howe has implemented a cap of 400 tourists at a time by fixing the number of beds available to visitors. This was to protect Lord Howe\u2019s many unique endemic species, which helped the island earn recognition as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1982. Although the number was arbitrary, maintaining it has minimized environmental impacts\u00a0and created a \u201cone-for-one visitor to local\u201d experience, said Darcelle Matassoni, a sixth-generation islander who works for the Lord Howe Island Board, the island\u2019s government. Unsurprisingly, that means it\u2019s difficult to get there; Makiiti says Bowker has bookings well into 2026. Airfares for a return trip to Sydney can run upwards of US$666, and in peak summer season, accommodation for two can range from US$200 to over US$3,000 per night. \u2018Alien concept\u2019 Those policies showcase a \u201cunited desire to make sure that nature comes out on top,\u201d said Dean Hiscox, who runs Lord Howe Environmental Tours. More than 85% of the island is still covered in its native forest, and around 70% is in a Permanent Park Preserve, meaning all development is prohibited. The residential settlement covers 15%. Visitors often wonder if there\u2019s pressure for more development, but on Lord Howe, that\u2019s an \u201calien concept,\u201d Hiscox said. Even the local community is effectively capped because of  rules on housing. Many residents are descended from original settlers who arrived in the 1800s. \u201cThose families that have been here for those five, six, seven generations have always recognized how special their lifestyle is here,\u201d said Ian Hutton, a naturalist and photographer who has lived on the island since 1980. \u201cThere is that strong generational feeling of protecting their island.\u201d Nature like nowhere else in the world Life on Lord Howe is \u201clike living inside a David Attenborough documentary,\u201d said Hutton, who is also the curator at the Lord Howe Island Museum, on his website. Although it\u2019s just seven miles long, the island is densely packed with plants and animals found nowhere else. The rainforests are filled with creeping plants, orchids and birds. Atop the summit of Mount Gower \u2013 one of the most popular hiking trails on Lord Howe \u2013 sits a rare, endangered cloud forest. The island\u2019s most famous endemic export is seeds of the Kentia Palm, the world\u2019s most popular palm to grow indoors. On the coast, people can walk by nesting colonies of the Providence Petrel, a gray and white seabird with a slightly curved black beak that mainly breeds on Lord Howe. The birds will swoop down when called and are so friendly to humans that a person can pick them up. Much of the allure is the proximity to nature. Beaches are just a few minutes\u2019 walk or bike ride away from the guesthouses, making Lord Howe \u201cthe easiest holiday,\u201d said Anthony Riddle, a sixth-generation islander who co-founded Lord Howe Island Brewing Company and Lord Howe Island Distilling Company. \u201cYou\u2019re only on a boat for five or 10 minutes, and you\u2019re already out to the main reefline. If you try and do that on the Great Barrier Reef, you might be on a boat for three or four hours and still not see nearly as much as you get to see here,\u201d Hiscox said. Around 500 species of fish, as well as starfish, urchins and crabs, populate the world\u2019s southernmost barrier reef right by the island, according to Hutton\u2019s website. One of the best places for diving is Ball\u2019s Pyramid, the world\u2019s tallest sea stack, which sits 14 miles southeast of the main island and is surrounded by caves and waters abundant in rare sea creatures. Like Lord Howe\u2019s residents, those who visit care deeply about preserving the island\u2019s natural world, Hiscox said. Tour guides always explain that tradition of sustainability to their guests, but they don\u2019t have to do much to convince them of its importance. \u201cWe just simply elaborate,\u201d Hiscox said. \u201cWe tell the story about what is it that\u2019s special about Lord Howe Island. You have a captive audience who are already tuned into that philosophy, and want to know about it. You\u2019re talking to the converted.\u201d Many visitors take that passion a step further by participating in local conservation programs. The Island Board has implemented a paid weed eradication program, and Hutton runs weeding ecotours and citizen science campaigns. Sniffer dogs There are also strict biosecurity procedures to protect against invasive species. All imports and visitors are checked, including by sniffer dogs. At the beginning of walking tracks, there are stations for hikers to scrub their boots to stop the spread of fungus. It\u2019s a level of intense conservation that blows people away from the moment they get off the airplane, Hutton said. \u201cThe sniffer dogs check their bags and (visitors) find out that the dogs are not looking for marijuana, they\u2019re just looking for rats and frogs,\u201d Hutton said. The island has carried out removals of introduced predatory feral pigs, goats and cats, and new domestic cats have been banned since 1982. Animals that were introduced to combat invasive species have also been removed. The one recent point of contention has been a successful government initiative in 2019 to eradicate rats and mice, which were destroying native species. The initiative was widely supported, but the use of a chemical rodenticide and the regular property inspections upset some. After the elimination of the rodents, many under-threat native species are now thriving. The Woodhen, a flightless bird that is one of the world\u2019s rarest, almost went extinct but its numbers have increased tenfold since the eradication, Hutton said. Despite efforts by the government and citizens to protect the island, many of its defining features are under threat from climate change.\u00a0A long run of record-breaking air and ocean temperatures fueled by climate change and the natural El Nino phenomenon has\u00a0caused several massive coral bleaching events and dieback in the cloud forest.\u00a0The increasing frequency of severe weather events means their future survival is \u201cin the lap of the gods,\u201d Hiscox said. An isolated history Lord Howe is today just a two-hour plane ride from the mainland, but historically the island and its close-knit community have been isolated. For decades, the only way to get there was by seaplane. These \u201cflying boats\u201d first began  regular flights to Lord Howe just after the end of World War II, and from the 1950s onward ferried passengers back and forth from Sydney six times a week, according to the Australian National Maritime Museum. The journey took around three hours each way. For islanders, life during that time was slow and nonmaterialistic. \u201cThere was no television, no internet, no telephones. We lived a completely unfettered and natural lifestyle. And pretty feral, I suspect, but safe feral,\u201d said Makiiti. \u201cNo shoes and everyone\u2019s main priority was that you could swim, but we just roamed the island in complete freedom and were outside all the time fishing and swimming and just hanging out.\u201d After the government built an airstrip in the 1970s, use of the flying boats ceased, and \u201csuddenly things speeded up a little bit,\u201d Makiiti said. But in many ways life on Lord Howe today is unchanged. Residents keep their doors unlocked, and there is no mobile phone service outside of home Wi-Fi networks. That isolation has bred challenges, but islanders have found unique ways to adapt. There is no secondary school, meaning all children must do distance education or attend boarding schools on the mainland. Buying anything takes a lot of thought because all imports, including food, must come on the fortnightly freight ship. The cost of living is triple that on the mainland \u2013 one apple costs US$2 and a liter of gas and a liter of milk each cost US$2.66, Riddle said. Many islanders have partially offset those costs by farming and gardening \u2013 in the island\u2019s subtropical climate, they can grow most anything from root vegetables to avocados, and have native botanicals like wild lemons. There\u2019s also a bartering system. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a nice other aspect of a connected community, where you\u2019re just sharing everything around and when you have too much of something, everybody benefits from that as well,\u201d Matassoni said. Sustainability in their DNA Despite the challenges, residents feel lucky to live as they do \u2013 rejecting excess with a mentality that\u2019s \u201call about reuse, reduce and look after,\u201d Makiiti said. It\u2019s a relaxed place where people spend their free time surfing, swimming and hiking, and most everyone gets around on bicycles. Respect for the environment is \u201cinstilled in us from a very young age,\u201d Matassoni said, \u201cbecause we are stewards of that environment.\u201d Residents and visitors alike \u201care very conscious of just a simple thing like not dropping an ice cream wrapper,\u201d Hutton said. Around 80% of the island\u2019s electricity is powered by a community solar grid, Hutton said. Everyone is also required to sort their own waste and bring it to the island\u2019s waste management facility. Anything that can\u2019t be reused, composted or recycled gets turned into garden mulch. \u201cNobody likes red tape but everybody understands that it\u2019s all in aid of making sure that we get to keep the lifestyle we have, that we get to keep the natural environment the way it is, that we are all very lucky to be here,\u201d Matassoni said. Makiiti says Bowker Beach House pays attention to the little details \u2013 the toiletries and coffee cups are reusable, and they even send coffee pods back to Nespresso. The eggs laid by the beach house\u2019s chickens go in reusable containers. Islanders \u201calways use the analogy less is more,\u201d Riddle said. \u201cThe longer we can keep it more unique like this, the more unique we are in the world.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/400-tourists-lord-howe-island-australia/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "travel"}}

{"id": "travel_menopause-retreats-hotels-spas-wellness", "text": "Gabriele Sewtz is not the kind of person who goes on wellness retreats. The German-born, Brooklyn-based real estate agent described herself as \u201cvery data-driven\u201d and thinks that oatmeal is an exciting breakfast. But that was before she started experiencing menopause, and before she found herself on a ranch outside of Austin, Texas, trying sound baths, cold plunges and breathwork \u2013 and loved it. Sewtz is one of a growing contingent of women seeking out hotels and resorts that offer menopause-specific programming. \u201cIf you had told me upfront how life-changing that (retreat) would be, I\u2019m like, \u2018Yeah, right. Not going to happen in a million years. Others might experience it, but definitely not me,\u2019\u201d she said. The significant physical, emotional and psychological changes that can happen during menopause are different for every woman. And as the wellness industry expands, it has begun to address perimenopause and menopause. A wave of supplements, skincare brands, nutrition programs and other products are being aimed squarely at this demographic \u2013 and some people find themselves preferring a spa or hotel to a doctor\u2019s office. \u201cIt always starts, I think, as a personal journey,\u201d said Sewtz. \u201cI think the last two, three years have brought on a wealth on the subject of perimenopause and menopause, dedicated Instagram accounts and celebrities joining in. But when it comes to treatment or figuring out what works well for you, you\u2019re pretty much still left to your own devices.\u201d Changing \u2018the change\u2019 \u201cMenopause is having a moment,\u201d said Dr. Barbra Hanna. An ob-gyn in Chicago, she is the founder of MyMenopauseRX, a telehealth service specializing in menopause-related care. Self-care is important, Hanna added, as many women experiencing menopause symptoms are also coping with life stressors like raising kids, managing a busy career or caring for aging relatives. In her opinion, spas are great places to relax, but not necessarily a place to get medical care. \u201cIt is not simply the menopause we want to address. Before the menopause they need to prepare themselves for a proper hormonal balance,\u201d said Dr. Naresh Perembuduri, an Ayurvedic doctor at the upscale Indian resort\u00a0Ananda in the Himalayas, whose website boasts endorsements from Uma Thurman and Oprah. \u201cSo that\u2019s a reason we have named it as a rebalance program.\u201d \u201cFrom menarche to menopause, (women) go through a lot of phases,\u201d said Perembuduri. Ananda does not have a menopause-specific program; rather, it offers a \u201chormonal rebalance\u201d experience. The 14-day program, which includes customized meal plans, exercise regimens and hormone testing, begins at $1,000 a night. And price isn\u2019t the only thing that may keep some women from signing up \u2013 social stigma and lack of education around menopause are still all too real. Fifty-one percent of the world\u2019s population is female, and menopause looks and feels different for everyone, which is one of the reasons it can be so hard to treat. Symptoms vary, including things like joint pain, hot flashes, mood changes, weight fluctuations and pain during sex. For those already interested in travel and wellness, the onset of menopause symptoms is just another reason to consider a spa or retreat visit. Actor Josie Bissett had been to other wellness programs before, but she chose Costa Rica\u2019s The Retreat for something that would specifically address all the changes she was going through. She told CNN that she enjoyed the seven-day The Big M program so much that she opted to stay on longer. \u201cIt was one of the most beautiful places and experiences I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Bissett said. \u201cThere\u2019s no manicures or pedicures. It\u2019s not that place. This is a place to heal, to be nurtured.\u201d While Sewtz\u2019s program \u2013 organized by fitness influencer Hannah Eden \u2013 was specifically designed for group participation, Bissett preferred doing her own thing. \u201cI really needed time to myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to take away from myself that feeling of, like, I should talk to people, I should be social, I should\u2026 No shoulds. You take care of you. You don\u2019t have to do anything that you don\u2019t want to do. You\u2019re here for you. You don\u2019t have to be friends with anybody.\u201d The future of menopause care Some medical professionals urge caution when it comes to using alternative therapies to cope with the symptoms of menopause. Hanna said the line should be drawn when treatments go beyond simple stress relief and self-care into claiming they can perform medical miracles. \u201cIf they want to offer you a lot of blood-testing, saliva-testing, fingerprints, all of these things, that is not evidence-based, that is not how we treat menopause. That\u2019s red flag number one,\u201d she said. \u201cMenopause companies are realizing that there\u2019s this huge economic opportunity to jump on the menopause bandwagon. A massage is a massage, a facial is a facial. There\u2019s no extra lotions and potions that are going to be transformative for you because of perimenopause or menopause, at least not today.\u201d But in five or 10 years? Maybe, she said, considering how much more funding is being given out to researching menopause these days. \u201cI don\u2019t think menopause is going out of fashion. I think menopause is just getting started.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/menopause-retreats-hotels-spas-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_article_how-to-survive-alligator-attack", "text": "Jeffrey Heim woke up on May 30, 2021, with one thing on his mind: Sharks.  Specifically, shark teeth. They\u2019re his passion and his business. An unsuccessful attempt the day before to find any of them only fueled his obsession to find some on his next outing, he told CNN Travel recently. So on a hot, sunny Sunday in Sarasota County, Florida, the 25-year-old Heim proceeded to the Myakka River on a spot about 45 minutes from the Gulf of Mexico. He had been there numerous times and was comfortable with plunging into its murky waters to find the teeth of extinct megalodons in the riverbed. He put on his wetsuit, mask, fins and snorkel and entered the water from the shore, not far from a restaurant along the riverbank.  Heim slipped beneath the surface. He was under no more than one minute when he felt something. Something bad. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything, didn\u2019t see anything. I just felt like a blunt force object \u2013 like someone \u2026 swinging a baseball bat and just whacking my head. But mostly what I felt was what I thought was a huge boat just slamming into me and just pulling me down.\u201d To his shock, it wasn\u2019t a boat.  He was in the water, alone and face-to-face with an alligator.  Gator attacks: Rare but fascinating   Heim was in a situation many people probably fear but very few actually experience: an attack by an alligator. An estimated 5 million wild American alligators are spread out across 10 states in Southeast and beyond, including parts of North Carolina and even the extreme southeastern tip of Oklahoma. Louisiana has an estimated 2 million wild gators in a state of about 4.65 million people. Florida sports roughly 1.25 million alligators (and more than 1,000 American crocodiles). Georgia has about a quarter of a million. Some of these gators inhabit places where lots of people live and many others vacation, such as lakes and rivers all across Florida and coastal South Carolina. Yet gator attacks aren\u2019t that frequent and deaths even more infrequent (deadly attacks from dogs and horses and other mammals are more common). There were 442 unprovoked bite incidents in Florida from 1948 to 2021, and 26 of these bites resulted in people dying, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conversation Commission. It turns out gators, in natural conditions, simply aren\u2019t that interested in people, according to Kimberly Andrews, a gator and snake expert with a doctorate in ecology from University of Georgia\u2019s Marine Extension and Georgia Sea Grant and who manages its Coastal Ecology Lab.  \u201cWe are not their prey. If you think about it, we\u2019re quite dangerous to attack. We\u2019ve got arms and legs. We can stand upright. We can walk, we can swim. \u2026 We\u2019re not a good animal to pick a fight with.\u201d \u201cUnless they\u2019re confronted, they\u2019re going to stay on their own turf.\u201d Nonetheless, people continue to be fascinated by such possible encounters. Overblown reputation     Andrews wants to dispel the notion of gators as aggressive, ravenous menaces on the move. \u201cThey\u2019re called ambush predators. We also call these \u2018sit-and-wait\u2019 predators,\u201d she said.  They\u2019re large, so it\u2019s \u201cenergetically costly for them to be really active. \u2026 We would be considered an active forager. We go out and find our food.\u201d Not so with gators. \u201cWhen you come down to it, they\u2019re not that maneuverable. Large body. Small legs. And this also plays into why the perception of their danger is exaggerated from the actuality.\u201d  Nonetheless, caution is advised when you\u2019re in gator territory, be that at golf courses, swamps, lakes, rivers and hiking and bike trails and fishing spots along waterways. Best defense: Avoid an attack  Education is key to avoiding a bad encounter, Andrews said. Start with knowing when gators are most active. Courtship season starts as spring warms up; mating extends in early summer; and in Okefenokee Swamp in southeastern Georgia, \u201cwe start to see eggs hatch out starting in September and October. \u2026 And that\u2019s when the females are most protective when they feel someone is threatening their babies,\u201d Andrews said. Your best season is winter: If it\u2019s cold, \u201cthey\u2019re not doing whole lot.\u201d When temperatures start settling into the 80s (27 Celsius), gators become mostly nocturnal. So it\u2019s best to avoid that refreshing night dip in unknown waters when it\u2019s hot. Don\u2019t provoke, don\u2019t feed, don\u2019t panic   Unprovoked attacks are rare, Andrews said. People are usually the provocateurs, not the gators. Gators can be disturbed or confused when folks have been known to try to grab them by their tails or go in for close-up photos of sunning gators Even worse, people will feed them. Then the reptiles start to associate humans with food. That\u2019s when gators can be most dangerous \u2013 when they\u2019ve lost their natural fear or disinterest in people. \u201cThey\u2019re more likely to take the easy way out and get our food than to do the work to fight for it,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cIn areas where we have high rates of tourism but not a lot of education and oversight of how people are interacting with alligators, we see feeding issues.\u201d  If you do have a gator encounter, she suggests staying calm and respecting its territory  \u201cSay you\u2019re kayaking, and you see an alligator, just keep going past it. Give it a wide berth, as much as the space will allow,\u201d Andrews said.  \u201cDon\u2019t take the paddles and slap the water. Sometimes people do that to scare the alligator off,\u201d but you\u2019re actually indicating you\u2019re a direct threat.  \u201cIf for some reason they start to swim toward you \u2026 usually try to go in the other direction and just show you\u2019re not interested. Or paddle right on by and ignore the animal.\u201d Also, never mess with the reptiles\u2019 children. \u201cWe always tell people that those one-foot baby alligators, even though they\u2019re so cute, they\u2019re the most dangerous sized alligator to mess with.\u201d That\u2019s because there\u2019s possibly a nearby mother ready to protect her young. More ways to avoid an attack   Authoritative websites have plenty of good advice to avoid a dangerous encounter. From the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory at the University of Georgia: \u2022 Don\u2019t feed ducks, turtles or other animals that share waters with alligators.  \u2022 Stay about 60 feet (18 meters) or more away from an adult alligator. If an alligator hisses or lunges at you, you are too close. \u2022 If you\u2019re driving, let an alligator cross the road. They move across roadways the most often in spring and summer.  \u2022 Supervise pets and children when you\u2019re in gator territory. \u201cLarge alligators do not recognize the difference between domestic pets and wild food sources,\u201d the SREL says. \u2022 Avoid heavy vegetation in and near the water\u2019s edge.  The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission also advises: \u2022 Never swim outside of posted areas, and swim only during daylight hours. Alligators are most active between dusk and dawn. \u2022 Get rid of fish scraps in garbage cans at boat ramps and fish camps; don\u2019t toss them in the water. Experts also advise people to call local or state authorities if you see alligators roaming around neighbors and other places you wouldn\u2019t expect. Do not try to handle the reptiles yourself. As for Jeffrey Heim, these tips were more than theory. Mission: Survival   Heim was in serious trouble, and he knew it. The gator had already bit him in the skull and on the hand. And it was coming toward him again. The gator \u201cpulled my mask off and pulled my head down towards my stomach. And then I come up, head above water. I no longer have the mask with the GoPro that\u2019s filming. And we\u2019re both looking at each other, and we both sit there for about two or three seconds, and I feel my head.\u201d  He wasn\u2019t sure what he was feeling at the time, but he learned later it was his scalp, partially torn off his skull and flapping in the water. Then \u201cshe lunges at me and I back away calmly \u2026  like I would with my experience with sharks, you don\u2019t want to act like prey. So I just backed away to keep my space.\u201d \u201cAnd then she really aggressively lunged at me \u2026\u201d  What to do if you\u2019re attacked   Heaven forbid you\u2019re that person like Heim who is being attacked by an alligator. Would you know what to do? If the gator is trying to drag you under the water, \u201cyou have to assume at this point you\u2019re fighting for your life, and you\u2019ve got to give it all you\u2019ve got,\u201d Andrews said.  \u201cWe recommend trying to poke them in the eye, hitting them in the top part of the skull or the side of the jaw. Those points are sensitive on alligators just like they are on us,\u201d she said. In a water attack, the danger is more from drowning than the bite, Andrews said. So get to land if possible. \u201cWe\u2019re better on land than they are. They\u2019re better in the water.\u201d But don\u2019t assume all is safe if you\u2019re on land. And the alligator has more in its arsenal that a fearsome set of teeth.  You can be injured if you\u2019re hit by the tail. Gators can also whip around with their skull and use it like a battering ram. Andrews knows first-hand how dangerous that can be.   She was part of a capture team once that had a gator taped up and its mouth secured when it unexpectedly whipped its head around.  \u201cIt actually hit me broad with the side of its head across my shins \u2026 and I blacked out. And I wondered, \u2018Oh my gosh, did I fracture my shin bone?\u2019 I had a lump the size of a tennis ball. It is amazing how muscular and powerful they are,\u201d Andrews recalled. The gator uses its mouth. Use yours. \u201cScream, make as much noise [as you can], not only fight back but make yourself as big and as much a pain in the rear end as you possibly can.\u201d If people are nearby, they should call 911 for help, Andrews said. If a pole is nearby, someone can beat on the gator and give it another target.  \u201cAnother person in an attempt to rescue you should never come in the water after you and the alligator. They can help you most by being on the ground and helping you get to the ground,\u201d Andrews said.  Other ways to fend off an attack   Here are some more survival tips from various wildlife departments and other experts: \u2022 If you can escape on land, run away in a straight line. Experts debunk the advice to zig-zag. Gators can move really fast on land, but only in short bursts and distances before they tire out. \u2022 Try to cause a gag reflex by jamming any objects you can reach into the back of the alligator\u2019s mouth. \u2022 Sometimes a gator will reposition its prey in its mouth. With its jaw back open, that is your chance to escape. \u2022 \u201cAlligators clamp down with powerful jaws, then twist and roll. If an alligator bites your arm, it may help to grab the alligator and roll with it to reduce tearing of the arm,\u201d according to advice from the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources. \u2022 Get immediate medical attention if bitten. Alligator bites often result in serious infection.   All of this is specific to American alligators, Andrews emphasizes.  Other crocodilian species in places such as Africa and Australia can be more aggressive. We\u2019re actually prey-sized for some of these, she said.  But the relatively few crocodiles in southern Florida aren\u2019t known for attacking people. The escape   One of Andrews\u2019 survival tips came in very hand handy as the female gator lunged yet again at Heim. \u201cI really backed away. Got out of that river as quickly as I could. I climbed out of the six-foot bank and stumbled over to the parking lot.\u201d He was about to pass out, but he was able \u201cto yell over to some people over at that restaurant.\u201d Fortunately, they heard his cries for help and were able to assist him with a first aid kit from the restaurant and call 911. While waiting for the paramedics, he wasn\u2019t in pain. But \u201cthe whole time I\u2019m sitting down just super loopy and exhausted. That\u2019s when I thought I was going to die.\u201d He ended up in the ICU in a hospital for two days but was back at work the next week \u201cwith staples in my head.\u201d  Lessons learned   Heim has now had time to reflect on what he did that day and on what others can learn from his attack. \u201cI knew there were gators there. This day, I basically did everything wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cI was aware it was gator mating season, but I went to the river with too much confidence, especially being alone, and free diving, which I had never done in that river before.\u201d \u201cThat cockiness, or confidence, led to the bite, honestly, even though this was an uncharacteristically aggressive alligator apparently. It was still the wrong time of year to go.\u201d  Like other young people who have spent time in the watery wilds in the Southeast, he was lulled into a false sense of security because he had been around gators before with no ill results. \u201cI was casually looking around for gators, but if I had even seen one, I had dove with them before and it hadn\u2019t caused an issue.\u201d \u201cI think the difference was this was near a restaurant, and fed gators are the most aggressive gators. So that\u2019s what the gator professionals believe contributed to this attack, too,\u201d Heim said.   \u201cIf you\u2019re going to dive in a river like that, which I don\u2019t suggest anymore, don\u2019t free dive. You\u2019re going to go up and down like their prey. And you\u2019re going to look much smaller that you actually are.\u201d \u201cWeigh all risks. Anything can happen at anytime to anyone. None of us are invincible. And I think it was the youth in me being a little too confident.\u201d  Heim has been chastened, but not chased off. He continues to search for shark teeth and has ramped up operations for his business, SHRKco. His approach is different now. He\u2019s more cautious. He said he has more and better equipment. He\u2019s even been diving back in the Myakka twice since the attack. However, he now goes with other people, including gator experts.  Andrews said it\u2019s crucial for people to co-exist with alligators because they\u2019re an Indispensable part of the ecology as an apex predator keeping populations of other animals in check. \u201cIn the South, they\u2019re part of our heritage. What a charismatic and iconic feature of our landscapes. It should be: We like our sweet tea. We like our grits. We like our alligators. This is part of who we are.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/article/how-to-survive-alligator-attack/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "travel"}}

{"id": "travel_article_chance-encounters-florence-italy-kacie-rose", "text": "Kacie Rose Burns walked into the Florence jazz bar, alone. \u201cI\u2019ll go for one song and suss it out,\u201d she thought, trying to quieten her nerves. Kacie slipped in at the back. The club was dark and busy, a few wall lights and neon signs illuminating people drinking, dancing and chatting. Before she could even take in the musicians on stage, Kacie\u2019s eyes landed on a tall man sitting at the bar. \u201cI walked in and he was there,\u201d Kacie tells CNN Travel today. \u201cWe clocked eyes.\u201d \u201cCiao,\u201d said the stranger, smiling. \u201cCiao,\u201d Kacie said back, before adding apologetically: \u201cThat\u2019s all the Italian I\u2019ve got for you.\u201d It was October 2018. Kacie was a 24-year-old New Yorker on vacation in Florence. It was her first time in Italy and her first time traveling solo. It was an exciting \u2013 and terrifying \u2013 experience. \u201cI was a professional dancer in New York,\u201d explains Kacie. \u201cA very exhausting career \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of toxicity, a lot of rejection, there\u2019s a lot of politics that come into play \u2013 and I was feeling a little stuck, a little unhappy, a little \u2013 just stagnant, if you will.\u201d Kacie spent her days auditioning, traveling for gigs and moonlighting at a clothing store. She needed a break, and she\u2019d long felt a \u201cpull\u201d to Italy and dreamed of an Italian vacation. \u201cI kept saying, \u2018I\u2019ll wait for somebody to go with, I\u2019ll wait, I\u2019ll wait. And then I was waiting for years. And so then one night \u2013 at two in the morning \u2013 I was like, \u2018What am I waiting for? Life is too short.\u2019 So I booked a solo trip to Italy.\u201d Kacie planned to spend the majority of her time in Rome and Venice and just a couple of days in Florence. But in the lead-up to the trip, she got chatting to a customer at the store she worked at. This woman had lived in Florence for five years and sung the Tuscan city\u2019s praises, persuading Kacie to add an extra day to her Florence stint. And that\u2019s how Kacie and the Italian stranger happened to be in the jazz club on the same evening. \u201cI\u2019m really glad that I listened to her,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cThat\u2019s the only reason why we met on the first night that I was in Florence, on that earlier day that I wasn\u2019t originally supposed to be there.\u201d A Florence meeting The man Kacie crossed paths with in the jazz bar was 26-year-old Dario Nencetti, a chef in a Florence hotel who usually worked nights. It just so happened that was the only evening he had off that week. The jazz bar, called Jazz Club Firenze, was one of Dario\u2019s favorite hangouts. He loved the music, the underground ambiance and the fact the bar encouraged punters to sign up for jam sessions. \u201cThat place is, let\u2019s say, unconventional for Florence,\u201d Dario tells CNN Travel. \u201cUsually in Florence, there\u2019s like a table for two or three or four people. In the jazz club, there are big tables, so you can sit with strangers and stuff, which I love.\u201d When Dario realized Kacie didn\u2019t know much Italian beyond \u201cciao,\u201d they switched to English. Dario told Kacie he\u2019d lived in Scotland for a year, and they got talking about travel. Kacie mentioned she was on her first solo trip and Dario said he\u2019d embarked on a similar adventure to Japan earlier that year. \u201cWe bonded from the beginning,\u201d says Dario. \u201cIt was really natural, really easy conversation.\u201d \u201cI remember he made me laugh,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Oh, this guy\u2019s interesting.\u201d So many people ask us, \u2018How did you know?\u2019 And I don\u2019t know how I knew. I was just like, \u2018Oh, this is something different.\u2019\u201d Kacie and Dario stayed at the jazz bar talking into the early hours of the morning. Then they spent as much time as possible together over the next two days. \u201cHe would meet me after his work \u2013 every night he got off at 11. And we would go out and we would just talk,\u201d recalls Kacie. \u201cI instantly fell in love with Florence. It\u2019s a very romantic city - cobblestone streets and medieval buildings. It looks like a painting everywhere you look.\u201d It was a whirlwind two days. One evening they sat by Florence\u2019s Ponte Vecchio bridge and talked until 3 or 4 a.m. It was as though Kacie was in a film \u2013 somewhere between every millennial\u2019s favorite \u201cThe Lizzie McGuire Movie\u201d and classic Florentine romance \u201cA Room with a View.\u201d Then, the two days were up and Kacie had to continue onto the next leg of her trip. It was still like something from a movie \u2013 only it wasn\u2019t obvious this one had a happy ending. \u201cI got on the train and he was standing on the platform. And I remember looking out the train, and I was so sad,\u201d she says. As the train pulled away from the station, Kacie wiped away tears and messaged her best friend back home in New York. \u201cI just met my future husband in Florence,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s the guy I\u2019m gonna marry. I\u2019m never gonna see him again.\u201d Her friend tried to cheer her up. \u201cYou\u2019re going to Rome,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYou\u2019ll meet a gladiator!\u201d But Kacie knew what she had with Dario wasn\u2019t replaceable. \u201cWe never stopped talking. We FaceTimed every single day,\u201d she says. This continued when Kacie was back in the US. And before long, Dario was planning a trip to visit New York. A New York minute On December 8, 2018 Dario arrived in the US. Kacie spent a week introducing Dario to her life in New York. \u201cIt was really cool to see it through his eyes,\u201d she says. \u201cShe showed me the real city,\u201d says Dario. Then the couple flew to Miami for a week\u2019s vacation. For Kacie and Dario, there was never a specific moment where they decided to embark on a relationship. \u201cIt was never a decision to be made,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cIt just went without saying,\u201d agrees Dario. \u201cBut I can\u2019t hide it, long distance was hard.\u201d The two struggled with time zones and their busy jobs that left them with little downtime, but tried to visit each other whenever they could. Cut to September 2019. Dario was back in New York visiting Kacie. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I move here?\u201d he suggested. He\u2019d loved the vibrancy of the city from the get-go and could see himself there. The restaurant scene was incredible. If he could find a job and organize the visa, it seemed like the ideal scenario. Kacie thought so too, so Dario started asking around. He was eventually hired as a chef at an Italian restaurant in Brooklyn. After a couple of months in limbo, his visa was approved. \u201cUp until that point, every time that we had to say goodbye it was borderline traumatic \u2013 we had spent this week together and we knew that this was it for each other,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cSaying goodbye in airports sucked. It would take like a week to recover.\u201d But now the airport goodbyes were consigned to the past. \u201cIt was really exciting,\u201d says Dario. Moving forward together Kacie and Dario spent three months in New York together, giddy with happiness to be in the same country and the same city. Then the pandemic hit. New York City\u2019s performing arts and restaurant industries ground to a halt. Stuck at home, Kacie and Dario found solace and support in one another. As Kacie puts it, she and Dario found \u201cmany silver linings\u201d in this tough time. Dario taught Kacie how to make pasta. They cat-sat. They spent long evenings chatting. But as 2020 rolled on, the couple were aware there was a deadline hanging over them. Dario\u2019s visa was set to run out in December and in the wake of the pandemic, renewal was out of the question. For Kacie and Dario, it seemed like there were only three viable choices: return to long distance, get married or move to Italy. Going back to long distance would mean the return of those airport goodbyes, the last thing either of them wanted. And while Kacie and Dario thought marriage was in their future, they didn\u2019t feel it was right for them at that point. That left moving to Italy. Kacie thought about her career in New York. Performing was off the table and there was no return date in sight. And while her friends were regularly posting on social media about how much they missed dancing, Kacie only felt \u201crelief\u201d that her days were no longer defined by auditioning and uncertainty. \u201cThat was a pretty big wake-up call,\u201d she says. \u201cI had gotten to a point where I needed to take a little step back from performing.\u201d On top of this, Kacie\u2019s New York apartment lease was up. If there was ever a time to relocate to Italy, it was now. \u201cEverything kind of fell into place,\u201d she says. Kacie researched online and found a language academy in Florence offering study visas. She applied, enrolling in Italian lessons. Then, Kacie and Dario packed up their life in New York and got ready to move across the Atlantic. Before stepping on the plane in January 2021, Kacie posted a video to TikTok about meeting Dario and the move to Italy. She\u2019d never posted much on the platform before, but felt inspired to mark this significant life step. When she stepped off the plane and connected to Wi-Fi, her cell phone was blowing up. \u201cIt went viral,\u201d says Kacie. While stuck inside during mandatory two-week quarantine, Kacie continued posting TikTok videos. Her following continued to grow. While her social media presence was getting bigger, for the first few months in Florence, Kacie and Dario\u2019s IRL world remained small. Italy was still in the thrall of Covid, with strict restrictions. But as Kacie studied for her Italian lessons and taught English online and Dario looked for restaurant work, Florence started to slowly reopen. \u201cI remember the first time going to the Duomo. And there was nobody there,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cWhich is crazy, because it\u2019s like the main focus point of Florence. And there\u2019s nobody in the piazza and I remember how bizarre that was.\u201d While that moment was surreal \u2013 even sad \u2013 Kacie and Dario still felt grateful to be at the Florentine landmark together. They\u2019d come a long way, and they were excited for their new life together in Italy. Acclimatizing to Italian life was made easier for Kacie by Dario\u2019s family, who welcomed her wholeheartedly \u2013 even if, in the early days, Kacie struggled with Italian and Dario\u2019s mother didn\u2019t know much English. The two women made communication work by using Google Translate on their cell phones. \u201cThey bonded immediately,\u201d says Dario. Kacie continued to post on social media, and her following ballooned. After about six months, she stopped teaching English online and decided to do social media full time. Dario encouraged this step. \u201cI think it was a really good idea diving into it,\u201d he says today. \u201cIt was the right moment, the right time, and I believed in her from the first moment.\u201d A life together in Italy Almost four years later, Kacie\u2019s expanded her social media presence into a travel company, running group tours around Italy and publishing her own travel guides. Meanwhile, Dario is still passionate about cooking and now works as a fine dining chef at a Florence restaurant. \u201cI really love the life we\u2019ve created here,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cWe live in a beautiful place with great food and he\u2019s got so many awesome things going for him and same with me.\u201d The couple encourage each other in their respective careers and endeavors, but they also savor their downtime. They love living in Florence and exploring Italy together. Dario and Kacie are settled in Florence for now, although they don\u2019t rule out a move elsewhere in the future. \u201cWe\u2019re enjoying the moment,\u201d says Dario. \u201cThe solid thing is the fact that we know we\u2019re in it together.

There\u2019s so many good things waiting. You just have to trust it,\u201d adds Kacie. \u201cTrust in the process.

{"id": "travel_japan-overtourism-nara-deer-intl-hnk", "text": "While Japan\u2019s overtourism issues may be causing headaches for local residents, there\u2019s one group that seems to be benefiting from the influx of people \u2013 deer. Specifically, the deer who live in Nara, the ancient capital outside of Kyoto that is home to a series of UNESCO-recognized historic buildings. Nara and its deer are so closely associated that the light-brown colored animals are pictured in the city\u2019s tourism ads, on buses, train tickets and more. Shops are packed full of deer-themed souvenirs like stuffed animals and antler headbands. The city recently carried out a deer census, determining there are 313 stags (males), 798 does (females) and 214 fawns (babies) in Nara Park. That\u2019s an increase of 92 from last year, and a total of 1,325 deer. But what does this have to do with tourism? Despite Nara being home to attractions like Todaiji Temple, one of the world\u2019s largest wooden structures, the majority of tourists come to meet the deer, who are known for bowing politely when given a cracker. Stalls around Nara sell these special rice bran \u201cShika Senbei\u201d treats, which are safe for the deer to eat. Nobuyuki Yamazaki of the Nara Deer Preservation Foundation told CNN that \u201ca constant increase in the number of deer crackers eaten has resulted in more active reproduction of the deer. There are also more tourists visiting the park, and the deer can get the crackers more easily.\u201d However, not all of the human-deer interactions are positive ones. Some deer have become too accustomed to having people around and too eager to snatch a cracker out of a tourist\u2019s hand. \u201cAs the number of deer and humans increase, so does the number of problems,\u201d Yamazaki added. \u201cIn recent years, we\u2019ve seen an increase in accidents with people being pushed over or bitten by a deer.\u201d A study from the Nara Women\u2019s University found that fewer deer were bowing during the pandemic, when the country was closed to international tourists. Bowing in deer is unique to Nara and has not been found in any other deer species. \u201cA long time ago, the deer in the capital Nara were afraid of humans, so they might have started bowing as a result of being stressed. However, the city gradually became a sightseeing spot and the deer learned to bow to people to get Shika Senbei rice crackers,\u201d said professor Yoichi Yusa, who headed the study. According to government data, 9.3 million people visited Nara in 2022. Japan has been coping with a significant influx of tourists since it reopened post-pandemic. March, April and May of this year each saw more than three million foreign tourists per month coming to Japan, breaking all-time tourism records. Some destinations, following similar measures implemented in Europe, have begun charging tourist fees. Beginning July 1, Mount Fuji implemented a daily visitor cap of 4,000 hikers. Visitors must pay 2,000 yen ($12.40) per person. Meanwhile, the popular Itsukushima Shrine near Hiroshima, which was visited by US President Joe Biden in 2023, recently began charging an entry fee for the first time in its thousand-year history.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/japan-overtourism-nara-deer-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "2024_07_23_travel_passenger-compensation-delta-air-lines-outage", "text": "Delta Air Lines faced its fifth day of operational disruptions on Tuesday stemming from a global tech outage. While most airlines affected by a CrowdStrike software update that crashed Windows systems had largely resumed normal operations by the end of the weekend, Delta was still struggling with the crew tracking system needed to staff its flights. Thousands of bags were separated from passengers who couldn\u2019t make the same journeys upon which their luggage embarked. And some weary, frustrated passengers were still trying to reconstruct travel plans or abandon them for compensation. Passengers over the weekend reported wait times of six hours or more on customer service phone lines before they gave up without reaching agents. The Department of Transportation has opened an investigation into Delta\u2019s service meltdown. Delta said it is cooperating with the DOT and remains \u201centirely focused on restoring our operation.\u201d \u201cAcross our operation,\u00a0Delta\u00a0teams are working tirelessly to care for and make it right for customers impacted by delays and cancellations as we work to restore the reliable, on-time service they have come to expect from\u00a0Delta,\u201d the airline said in a statement. Here\u2019s what we know about what they\u2019re entitled to and how passengers can make claims with the airline. What are Delta passengers entitled to? A refund The Department of Transportation has been adamant that airlines offer money-back refunds to passengers affected by cancellations or \u201csignificant\u201d delays, rather than e-credits for future travel. Travelers may choose e-credits, but portions of their trips not flown are refundable. Delta lists a \u201cright to a refund upon request\u201d in a Monday afternoon update on what it\u2019s doing to serve affected customers. Delta refunds can be requested here. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg hammered the refund requirement on X over the weekend. \u201cI am hearing reports of some airlines only offering flight credits to passengers for cancelled flights.\u00a0Let me be clear \u2013 you are entitled to get your money back promptly if your flight is cancelled and you don\u2019t take a rebooking,\u201d Buttigieg posted Saturday. While there was some question in the early hours of the outage on Friday whether the situation was within the airlines\u2019 control, the DOT soon put that question to rest for US carriers, deeming the fallout from the system outage \u201ccontrollable.\u201d \u201cA \u2018controllable\u2019 flight cancellation or delay is one that is attributable to the airline,\u201d the DOT said in a statement Friday, which put commitments airlines have made to their customers in such events applicable. Those are detailed on this DOT dashboard. Coverage of eligible expenses Delta outlined that it is responsible for covering expenses \u201cresulting from this flight  disruption, including providing meal vouchers, hotel accommodations where available and ground transportation.\u201d Lines stretched down concourses on Saturday evening at Delta\u2019s hometown airport, Atlanta\u2019s Hartsfield-Jackson International. Some passengers reported six-hour waits, and many affected passengers had trouble securing food and lodging over the weekend. Buttigieg addressed mounting complaints from passengers on Sunday: \u201cDelta must provide prompt refunds to consumers who choose not to take rebooking, free rebooking for those who do, and timely reimbursements for food and hotel stays to consumers affected by these delays and cancellations, as well as adequate customer service assistance,\u201d he posted on X. Reimbursement of eligible expenses Travelers who made their own arrangements during the disruption can be reimbursed. \u201cCustomers who have incurred hotel, meal or ground transportation expenses while in transit during this operational disruption may submit eligible expenses for reimbursement,\u201d Delta said in an outline of what travelers can expect.\u00a0(Among the expenses that are not eligible for reimbursement: hotel reservations at the traveler\u2019s destination, vacation experiences, lost wages, tickets to concerts or other events). Impacted passengers can submit reimbursement requests here. Additional compensation The airline has also said it would issue Delta SkyMiles or a travel voucher \u201cin an amount based on the customer\u2019s affected travels.\u201d How can passengers file complaints? Complaints can be filed online with Delta. Online complaints generate a case number that can be used to track them. An auto-response to one passenger complaint filed on Monday said most inquiries receive a response \u201cwithin 7 days,\u201d adding \u201chowever, due to the complexity of certain situations, additional time may be required to respond.\u201d The Department of Transportation also fields air travel service complaints. \u201cWhile you should first try to resolve issues directly with the airline, we want to hear from passengers who believe that Delta has not complied with USDOT-enforced passenger protection requirements during the recent travel disruptions. We will follow up,\u201d Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg posted Tuesday on X. The DOT says on its website that contacting airlines directly may result in the fastest resolution of many service complaints, but the agency does require airlines to acknowledge consumer complaints filed with the DOT. \u00a0The agency also collects complaints in a database to help it spot trends in the industry that may inform future rulemaking. How can passengers retrieve luggage? The operational meltdown has separated thousands of passengers from their luggage, which in many cases made it to destinations the passengers could not reach. Claims for delayed, lost or damaged luggage can be submitted online. However, the form requires a file reference number that can only be obtained through a Delta agent. \u201cYour file reference number is 8 or 10-digit alphanumeric code located on the front of baggage information folder given to you by the Delta agent with whom you first reported your baggage delay,\u201d Delta\u2019s online form says. In Atlanta on Monday morning, passengers waited in two-hour plus lines to speak with Delta agents at the Baggage Service Office to get those reference numbers and file claims. Claims can be filed at any Baggage Service Office. Customers can also call 1-800-325-8224 to make a baggage claim. \u201cWe have set up an internal Baggage Command Center in Atlanta, where we are seeing the highest number of displaced baggage, in an effort to expedite the process of reuniting customers with their belongings,\u201d Delta said on Tuesday. Delta has extended its travel waiver for travel through July 23. Details are available here.

Singapore\u2019s state food agency has approved 16 species of edible insects for sale and consumption in the country, according to a July 8 public circular addressed to food traders. \u201cWith immediate effect, SFA will allow the import of insects and insect products belonging to species that have been assessed to be of low regulatory concern,\u201d the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) said in its release. Insects approved by the SFA include locusts, grasshoppers, mealworms and several species of beetle. \u201cThese insects and insect products can be used for human consumption or as animal feed for food-producing animals,\u201d SFA said, adding that insects could not be \u201charvested from the wild.\u201d \u201cDocumentary proof (is needed to show) that insects are farmed in premises regulated by the Competent Authority,\u201d SFA said.

A spokesperson said that insects not on listed would \u201cneed to undergo evaluation to ensure they can be used for human consumption.\u201d Like much of the world, eating insects in Singapore remains a novelty. Researchers have recorded more than 2,100 edible species of insects \u2013 many of which are packed with important vitamins and minerals and serve as a sustainable source of high protein in contrast to methane-producing livestock. \u201cInsects are an overlooked source of protein and a way to battle climate change,\u201d according to a 2022 report by the World Economic Forum. \u201cOur consumption of animal protein is the source of greenhouses gas and climate change.

Live insects are commonly sold in Singapore as food for pets like songbirds and reptiles, but they could be a new and exciting option for human diners. Local chefs, restaurants and food and beverage companies have been experimenting with different ways to safely serve up insects in dishes like salted egg crabs with superworms and products like protein bars. \u201cAs the insect industry is nascent and insects are a new food item here, SFA has developed an insect regulatory framework which puts in place guidelines for insects to be approved as food,\u201d SFA said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/travel/singapore-approves-insects-consumption-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_vacation-fling-love-story-chance-encounters", "text": "Guillermo Barrantes relationship with Larry Mock was supposed to begin and end in Palm Springs. It was a \u201ccasual, brief encounter.\u201d A vacation dalliance that only lasted half a day. \u201cIt was just so casual, so easily nothing could have happened from it,\u201d Guillermo tells CNN Travel. \u201cWe could have walked away and just had our lives separate. But of course that didn\u2019t happen, because it wasn\u2019t meant to be that way. It was meant to be the way that it was. That it is.\u201d It all started in summer 2013. Guillermo - then in his early 40s - was on vacation in the California resort city of Palm Springs. He was in a phase of life where, he says, he was prioritizing himself, and wasn\u2019t interested in long term romance. \u201cI thrived in being by myself, in traveling by myself, in having dinner by myself \u2013 I loved all of that so much,\u201d says Guillermo, who lived in Boston, Massachusetts at the time. \u201cI wanted no commitment, I wanted no emotional entanglement of any kind. I wanted to have fun, get to know myself. And it was in that mode that I met Larry, when I wasn\u2019t really looking.\u201d During the vacation in Palm Springs, Guillermo was staying at a friend\u2019s apartment, and while the friend worked during the day, Guillermo passed his time at a \u201crun-down, no-frills\u201d resort a couple of blocks away. \u201cYou could just pay for a day pass, they\u2019d give you a towel, and you could be in the pool and use their bar,\u201d he recalls. One day, as he was walking the palm tree-lined streets to the resort, Guillermo swiped right on a guy on a dating app \u2013 Larry Mock, mid-40s, friendly smile. The two men exchanged a few messages back and forth. Larry said he was also on vacation in Palm Springs, staying in the resort Guillermo kept frequenting. They arranged to meet there for a drink by the pool. Guillermo was looking forward to meeting Larry, expecting \u201csome casual fun.\u201d Then, when Guillermo and Larry met, there was \u201cchemistry\u201d right away. Guillermo calls their connection \u201cmagnetic.\u201d \u201cMy impression of Larry: sexy, handsome and warm,\u201d he recalls. Larry was a Texas-based American Airlines flight attendant who\u2019d booked the vacation to Palm Springs at the last minute. He\u2019d recently broken up with a long-term partner but due to lease and budget reasons the two were still living together \u2013 awkwardly \u2013 in Dallas, Texas. Larry\u2019s workdays were spent traveling the world. But during his downtime, he struggled to relax in the apartment with his ex, and this sentiment motivated the spontaneous vacation. \u201cI needed to get out of town for the weekend, because we were just butting heads badly at that time,\u201d Larry tells CNN Travel today. Larry searched his airline\u2019s database, looking at destinations he could visit using the last minute, standby flight tickets available for flight attendants. \u201cPalm Springs had seats, so I booked my standby flight, got to Palm Springs, checked into this resort. And that\u2019s where Guillermo came into the picture,\u201d says Larry. Larry was instantly attracted to Guillermo. He thought he was \u201cjust the most handsome guy\u201d he\u2019d ever seen. And as they got chatting, and Guillermo kept making Larry laugh, Larry sketched out his first impression to include two more adjectives: \u201cso funny, and so kind.\u201d In passing, as the two flirted over pool-side cocktails, Larry mentioned that he was a flight attendant. Guillermo lit up. In fact, his response was \u201cgiddy,\u201d as Larry recalls it. \u201cHe started asking me tons of questions about planes, and flight attendants, and the routes and all of that kind of stuff.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a huge aviation geek,\u201d explains Guillermo. As a kid growing up in Costa Rica, he\u2019d wanted to be a pilot. Instead, he ended up working as an IT consultant. And while he says he was good at that job, liked it well enough and made good money \u2013 he still dreamed about working in aviation. Meeting a flight attendant was fascinating. \u201cI was immediately drawn to his career,\u201d says Guillermo. Larry found Guillermo\u2019s enthusiasm for aviation charming, and happily answered his questions. Later that evening, Larry and Guillermo said their goodbyes, with no plans to meet again. \u201cI was glad to meet him,\u201d says Larry. \u201cBut I was like, \u2018There\u2019s no way I am going to pursue dating somebody that lived in Boston.\u2019 And I still was dealing with what I was dealing with in Dallas.\u201d \u201cWe just really enjoyed the time that we had together,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cBut we went our separate ways.\u201d Unexpected moments Almost without realizing \u2013 and certainly without intending to \u2013 Guillermo and Larry stayed in touch. \u201cWe kept chatting, we kept texting,\u201d says Guillermo. Then, a few days after meeting Larry, Guillermo got an unexpected phone call from his mother in Costa Rica. He was still in Palm Springs at the time. \u201cShe said, \u2018I don\u2019t want you to freak out, but I just got diagnosed with breast cancer. I don\u2019t want you to change the trip.\u2019\u201d Guillermo tried to protest, but his mother insisted he should enjoy the rest of his vacation. She reassured him that her sisters and Guillermo\u2019s father were taking care of her, and she\u2019d see Guillermo later in the month \u2013 he already had a trip to Costa Rica scheduled for that summer. Not wanting to go against his mother\u2019s wishes, Guillermo stayed put in the desert. He tried to \u201ccompartmentalize\u201d the news, but he was really close to his mom, and it was cataclysmic. Later, back home in Boston, Guillermo found himself sharing his mother\u2019s news with Larry, and confiding in him about his fears and worries. He added that his mother lived in Costa Rica, so he\u2019d likely be flying back and forth for the rest of the year. Larry was supportive, empathetic \u2013 and he told Guillermo that he should use the discounted flights Larry got through work. Guillermo was taken aback \u2013 it was \u201csuch a sweet gesture\u201d from someone who was basically a stranger. But then, somehow, Larry already felt much more than that. \u201cVery early on, he and I had just beautiful interactions, and it revealed the kind of person that he was,\u201d he says. And so, rather than dwindling, Larry and Guillermo\u2019s communication increased as the days rolled on. \u201cWithin just a few weeks, we just knew \u2013 without much discussion, without talking about it \u2013 we just knew that there was a very, very strong connection there,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cWe always had something to talk about,\u201d says Larry. Larry was still hesitant about jumping into something new, following the breakdown of his previous relationship. But the messages back and forth with Guillermo became a highlight of his day. And as time passed, he found himself opening up to Guillermo, confiding in him. \u201cAfter a few months, I was like, \u2018Yes, this is exactly what I was looking for my whole life. Someone that I can be my authentic self with,\u2019\u201d says Larry. Long-distance dating In September 2013, two months after their Palm Springs meeting, Larry arranged to visit Guillermo in Boston. At Logan Airport, Larry came down the escalator and spotted Guillermo\u2019s face in the crowd. He was beaming, and started running towards Larry. Then, Guillermo \u201chugged me so hard,\u201d recalls Larry. He remembers thinking, \u201cOh my god, this is the one.\u201d Then Guillermo and Larry went to Boston\u2019s seaport district together, and found a sundrenched rooftop bar where they sat drinking beers. \u201cWe could see the planes approaching Logan, and it was just a sunny and perfect Boston day,\u201d recalls Guillermo. \u201cI remember that, like a picture, sitting by the edge \u2013 I remember the beer and I remember the planes.\u201d It was \u201cmagical,\u201d says Guillermo, but also slightly \u201csurreal.\u201d The Palm Springs encounter was so brief. He never thought he\u2019d see Larry again. And now here Larry was, sitting opposite him, in Guillermo\u2019s city. From there, Guillermo and Larry started dating cross-country. They took advantage of Larry\u2019s discounted flights. Sometimes Larry traveled to Boston, but usually Guillermo visited Larry in Dallas. Guillermo\u2019s love of flying meant that, for him, the four-hour journey across the country was part of the fun. \u201cI was in heaven,\u201d he says. \u201cJust the fact that I was getting to do something that I have always just loved - which is being on an airplane and going somewhere.\u201d Each Friday, as he packed his bag and headed to the airport, Guillermo would also be struck with \u201cexcitement\u201d at the thought of seeing Larry. And during these weekend visits, Guillermo and Larry grew accustomed to each other\u2019s habits, how they moved through their days, how they liked to spend their time. Guillermo got to know Larry\u2019s friends and got to know Dallas as a city. They spoke about their hopes, dreams, ambitions and families. Guillermo says it was obvious that they were \u201cvery aligned on the important aspects of life: how we view finances, closeness with families, politically and world views and enjoyment of the small things in life.\u201d Larry supported Guillermo as he cared for his mother through her cancer, and celebrated with him when she recovered. \u201cFor us, it was a gradual process of falling in love,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cBut a theme for us in our life together is that everything felt right and natural.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t pinpoint the moment, but we simply knew very deep in our hearts that we found the life partner.\u201d \u201cThat made me so happy,\u201d says Larry. For Guillermo, moving to Dallas two years later, in late 2015, was \u201cjust as the easiest decision.\u201d Larry was thrilled. His Dallas-based friendship group had already welcomed Guillermo into the fold, and his parents were happy for him too. \u201cI introduced Guillermo to everybody,\u201d says Larry. \u201cMy family\u2019s always been very accepting of me.\u201d Guillermo\u2019s family situation was more complicated. He\u2019s always been very close with his parents and siblings, but for the first two decades of his adult life, he didn\u2019t talk to his family about relationships. \u201cMy personal life was not necessarily an open book,\u201d Guillermo says. \u201cLove has never been the question - my parents love me, I love my parents and my sisters, we all get along great. But there was always that invisible barrier, which was: I don\u2019t talk about my personal relationships.\u201d But Guillermo didn\u2019t want to hide Larry from anyone - he felt he owed that to himself, and to Larry. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to edit myself, I wasn\u2019t going to filter. I just knew deep in my heart that it was my chance to be able to truly be myself,\u201d he says. So Guillermo started peppering his phone calls home with mentions of Larry. He uploaded cute photos of the two of them to social media. \u201cI\u2019m fearless,\u201d he told himself. \u201cNothing bad can happen here.\u201d A monumental year Cut to 2018, which was a monumental year for Guillermo and Larry for a couple of reasons. For one, it was the year Guillermo followed in Larry\u2019s footsteps and became a flight attendant. It was a mutual friend who suggested Guillermo should give it a shot, and Larry \u2013 who\u2019d spent years listening to Guillermo wax lyrical about airplanes \u2013 was wholeheartedly encouraging. Guillermo applied to Larry\u2019s airline, American Airlines, but wasn\u2019t accepted. But then he applied to Delta, and was accepted on the spot. While Guillermo and Larry loved the idea of working together, flying with different airlines also \u201cworked out great,\u201d says Guillermo. For one, there were two different sets of airline benefits to enjoy. And working in the air was everything Guillermo hoped it would be and more. \u201cI was doing my dream job, my childhood dream job,\u201d he says. \u201cI still have to pinch myself that actually, I am a flight attendant.\u201d 2018 was also the year Guillermo and Larry got married. Guillermo proposed to Larry on an airplane. The couple were flying back to Dallas after visiting San Francisco, where they\u2019d attended an Adele concert. As they were descending, the Dallas lights glistening out the airplane window, Guillermo suddenly felt the time was right. He turned to Larry and asked him to marry him. Larry smiled, and said yes. \u201cDespite it being impromptu, as an aviation geek, I love that I proposed on a flight,\u201d says Guillermo. The couple started planning their nuptials. Guillermo was excited, but he was unsure what role \u2013 if any \u2013 his family would play on the wedding day. While Guillermo had mentioned Larry to his parents, they still hadn\u2019t met him. This was partly because Guillermo\u2019s family were in Costa Rica, and partly because Guillermo wasn\u2019t sure how that meeting would play out. \u201cThe person that I had the most trouble with was my father \u2013 because he was the one that had the hardest time really accepting me,\u201d says Guillermo. As plans for the wedding started to take shape, Guillermo composed a long email to his father. \u201cI said something to the effect of, \u2018Hey Dad, I know I really haven\u2019t really talked much about any of my personal life. But I met this person, Larry, who is the love of my life. We are going to get married. Come, don\u2019t come, no problem. But I just need to tell you because this is probably one of the most important days and times of my life.\u2019\u201d Guillermo\u2019s father didn\u2019t attend the wedding. \u201cFor those reasons and also because he was towards the end of his life, his mobility was a problem,\u201d Guillermo says. \u201cBut my mom, my sisters, my niece and my nephew came, which was far more than I ever imagined or dreamed. That was such a great moment.\u201d Guillermo introduced his mother and sisters to Larry a couple of days before the wedding. They all gathered at a rooftop bar in Dallas, along with Guillermo and Larry\u2019s close friends. When Guillermo\u2019s mother saw Larry for the first time, she enveloped Larry in her arms. The two hit it off right away. Guillermo was overwhelmed with happiness. \u201cFor me, to see Larry and mom interact \u2013 they just love each other so much,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cAnd my sisters just cannot get enough of him \u2013 I just sit back, and just enjoy.\u201d A magical wedding day Guillermo and Larry\u2019s wedding took place at the Dallas Arboretum, a botanical garden. It was an outdoor wedding, and the couple woke up to the rain pouring and concerned texts from guests worried how the wedding would play out in a downpour. \u201cBut then, sure enough, out came the sun at the right time,\u201d recalls Guillermo. Larry and Guillermo wrote their own vows and read them to each other during the ceremony. Guillermo told Larry that he inspired him to be a better son, sibling, friend and person. \u201cYou want a partner that is going to challenge you to be better,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cI always feel that I want to be a better human being just in general, because he is such a figure in my life and everyone\u2019s life \u2013 he is the center of everybody\u2019s life.\u201d In turn, Larry promised Guillermo their married life would be \u201cexciting, adventurous and full of passion.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m proud to take you as my husband. I promise to fly with you to the ends of the earth,\u201d Larry said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to grow old together and look back at this beautiful moment.\u201d He ended the vows telling Guillermo: \u201cTe amo\u201d \u2013 Spanish for \u201cI love you.\u201d The reception was held at a local winery. During the celebrations, Guillermo and Larry danced to Rihanna\u2019s hit \u201cWe Found Love,\u201d which includes the lyric: \u201cWe found love in a hopeless place.\u201d The couple felt it was fitting \u2013 the resort they met at did seem a bit of a \u201chopeless place.\u201d And they never expected that brief meeting would lead to a lasting love. \u201cWe made sure that song was played, because we did find love in a hopeless place,\u201d says Larry. \u201cAnd I love Rihanna, too,\u201d says Guillermo. At one point, Guillermo and Larry walked through the reception doors holding hands, spontaneously lifting their arms in the air, a \u201cvictorious\u201d pose, as Guillermo put it. \u201cIt was just an electric effect,\u201d he says. The last piece of the puzzle A few years into their marriage, Guillermo and Larry visited Costa Rica together for the first time. Larry was excited to see Guillermo\u2019s home country, and Guillermo was excited to show his husband where he grew up \u2013 and the visit was also an opportunity for Larry to finally meet Guillermo\u2019s father. Guillermo was nervous about how the meeting would play out, but when he arrived at his parents\u2019 house with Larry in tow, Guillermo\u2019s father opened his arms and hugged Larry tightly. \u201cHe said, \u2018Welcome home,\u2019\u201d says Guillermo. It was a cathartic, emotional moment for everyone. \u201cI was so nervous that day, meeting the father-in-law,\u201d says Larry. \u201cAnd when he just said \u2018welcome home,\u2019 and hugged me, every bit of nerves went away. I felt comfortable, I felt welcomed, I felt loved.\u201d Larry says the moment felt like the \u201clast piece\u201d of a puzzle slotting into place. Guillermo was overjoyed. \u201cThat evening, which we got to spend \u2013 me, mom, dad, and Larry \u2013 was just a highlight,\u201d says Guillermo. The family played old records on a turntable. Guillermo and his mother danced in the living room, while Larry and Guillermo\u2019s father sipped cocktails and watched, laughing. \u201cI had to just step back, because you have to look at those moments and just kind of create a little mini movie of them,\u201d says Guillermo. Guillermo\u2019s father has since passed away, which makes Guillermo and Larry all the more grateful for that time together in Costa Rica. In general, a feeling of gratitude defines Guillermo and Larry\u2019s relationship \u2013 gratitude for each other and what they\u2019ve brought to one another\u2019s lives, and gratitude that their paths crossed over ten years ago. On their anniversary, the couple usually return to Palm Springs to celebrate the day they met. \u201cNot only is Palm Springs beautiful with a great vibe, but we love to go back and celebrate our meeting place,\u201d says Larry. \u201cWe weren\u2019t looking, neither one of us \u2013 but it did happen, and it\u2019s definitely for life.\u201d \u201cWhat a gift,\u201d says Guillermo, who says his life today is what he dreamed of \u201cas a little gay boy in Costa Rica, always loving the US, always loving airplanes, always envisioning that I would have a relationship where we are completely free to show our love.\u201d \u201cAnd we do, we do,\u201d he says. \u201cWho could ask for anything more?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/vacation-fling-love-story-chance-encounters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_worlds-50-best-restaurants-for-2024", "text": "Any doubts that Spain remains the fine dining center of the world may just have evaporated with the revealing of the World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants for 2024 list. Five eateries from the European nation made the list \u2013 three of them in the top five. The awards\u00a0\u2013 considered the Oscars of global fine dining \u2013 were handed out at a ceremony at the Wynn in Las Vegas on Wednesday evening, with Barcelona\u2019s Disfrutar walking away with the top prize. Ranked number two last year, it\u2019s owned and run by chefs Oriol Castro, Eduard Xatruch and Mateu Casanas. The fact that this trio met while working at the legendary El Bulli should provide a few clues as to what diners can expect \u2013 imaginative and playful dishes executed with technical mastery, such as the caviar-filled Panchino doughnut, the frozen gazpacho sandwich and squab with kombu spaghetti, almond and grape. Coming in at number two was Asador Etxebarri of Atxondo, not far from the Spanish port city of Bilbao. Under the leadership of chef Victor Arguinzoniz, it\u2019s famed for offering unbeatable barbecue that lets the quality of the ingredients shine, such as a red Palam\u00f3s prawn that\u2019s simply grilled and served on its own. But you can never count Paris out.\u00a0The French capital\u2019s Table by Bruno Verjus\u00a0squeezed into third place, while yet another restaurant from Spain \u2013 Madrid\u2019s Diverxo \u2013 took the fourth spot. Coming in at fifth was Lima\u2019s Maido, one of three restaurants from the city to make the list, giving the Peruvian capital\u2019s reputation as South America\u2019s premier dining destination yet another boost. Mexico was the big winner in North America, earning three restaurants on the list, led by Mexico City eatery Quintonil, which came in seventh. The rest of the list Securing five restaurants on the list was enough to make Spain the biggest winner of the night in Vegas. In terms of cities, Paris and Bangkok tied for first, each with four restaurants on the list. Gaggan Anand, at number nine, was the Thai capital\u2019s top entry. As for the event\u2019s host country, the US had two restaurants on this year\u2019s 50 Best list. New York City\u2019s Atomix came in 6th this year, rising two spots since last year. SingleThread, in the town of Healdsburg in California\u2019s Sonoma Valley, landed in 46th place. Three restaurants from Tokyo were awarded, with eatery S\u00e9zanne\u00a0(voted Asia\u2019s best restaurant in 2024) ranking the highest in the Japanese capital, at 15. Hong Kong saw two of its restaurants hit the list, with both making impressive moves. Wing was the city\u2019s highest new entry on the entire list, at 20, while The Chairman was the highest climber, moving from last year\u2019s 50th spot into number 26. The list is compiled based on the votes of the\u00a0The World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants Academy, which is made up of\u00a0 1,080 international restaurant industry experts including food writers and chefs, in 27 regions around the world. Restaurants can only win the top prize once, after which they\u2019re entered into a separate \u201cBest of the Best\u201d program. Members of that elite group include Geranium and Noma in Copenhagen, as well as New York\u2019s Eleven Madison Park, The Fat Duck near London, Osteria Francescana in Modena, Italy, and Mirazur in Menton, France. Last year\u2019s winner, Central of Lima, Peru, now joins them on that list. The world\u2019s 50 best restaurants 2024 1. Disfrutar\u00a0(Barcelona, Spain) 2.

{"id": "travel_mediterranean-beach-vacation-microplastics-pollution", "text": "The Mediterranean Sea may evoke images of luxurious beach holidays, scrumptious seafood meals and endless sandy beaches, but this body of water is increasingly toxic. More than 87% of the Mediterranean Sea, which extends from the Atlantic Ocean to Africa, Europe and Asia, is polluted with microplastics and other pollutants including toxic metals and industrial chemicals, according to a July 2024 report by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). Globally, water pollution is tied to 1.4 million premature deaths, which spells trouble for the 150 million people who live along the Mediterranean coastline, and the 270 million tourists who are drawn to these waters every single year. The Mediterranean Sea laps up against 46,000 kilometers (nearly 29,000 miles) of coastline in 22 countries, many with different environmental standards and practices. Egypt, which contributes 0.25 million tons of plastic that ends up in the Mediterranean, is the worst offender, the group says, followed by Turkey, which contributes 0.11 million tons and Italy, which contributes 0.04 million tons of plastic to the polluted sea \u2013 all part of the 1.9 million plastic fragments per square meter. Medical experts consulted for the WWF report say that humans can ingest microplastics from aquatic environments through the consumption of marine organisms and through water (both drinking and bottled). \u201cOver 840 microplastics can be ingested per year from the consumption of three main commercial fish species (sea bass and two types of mackerel), [and] up to 11 thousand from the high consumption of bivalves (e.g. mussels, clams etc.),\u201d the report states, noting that less contamination comes from eating shrimp. \u201cIf we also count the exposure from air and food not coming from aquatic environments we can ingest over 100 thousand microplastics every day.\u201d Turning the tide At the seaside town of Ostia near Rome, Pierluigi Capozzi scans the sea from his restaurant, Mediterraneo. \u201cMaybe 50 years ago, people didn\u2019t know what we know now about pollution and plastic,\u201d he tells CNN. \u201cBut I see young people without any problems throw plastic bottles into the sea, throw rubbish on the ground, cigarettes, garbage.\u201d But he does see a bright spot. A decade ago, every morning the sand outside his beachfront restaurant was covered with chemicals from the cargo ships that traverse the shipping lanes visible from the coastline. \u201cThanks to better regulation, that chemical pollution is gone now,\u201d he says. The Mediterranean is one of the world\u2019s major reservoirs of marine and coastal diversity, according to the Med Sea Alliance, which works to advocate for the fishing industry through better practices. They say that the heavy pollution is negatively impacting the sea\u2019s rich flora and fauna. Despite only covering 0.7 percent of the world\u2019s ocean area, the sea has 7.5 percent of the world\u2019s marine fauna, and 18 percent of the world\u2019s marine flora. Fishing is a \u20ac4.6 billion industry in the Mediterranean, and water pollution has greatly impacted the livelihood of the 180,000 people who rely on fishing for their livelihoods, says the WWF. The UN\u2019s Environmental Program says sea catches in the Mediterranean have fallen by 34% in the last 50 years, due to both over-fishing and plastics in the water. \u201cAround 730 tonnes of plastic waste end up daily in the Mediterranean Sea,\u201d the group says. \u201cPlastic waste represents 95 to 100% of marine floating waste and 50% of litter on sea beds. In tonnage, plastic could outweigh fish stocks.\u201d Impact on marine life A 2023 study by the Archipelago Institute of Marine Conservation in Greece examined 25 marine animals including eight dolphins, two monk seals and 15 sea turtles and found microplastic pollutants in all of them. \u201cIn particular, among other types of plastic, a total of 10,639 microplastic fibers were detected in the gastrointestinal tract of the dead marine mammals and turtles.\u201d Raffaele Marfella, a professor of advanced science at the Vanvitelli University in Naples, says plastic pollution is an urgent global problem that goes beyond harm to the environment. Citing a recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine, he highlights the link between microplastics\u00a0and nanoplastics known as MNPs and certain cardiovascular diseases. \u201cCurrent knowledge suggests that MNPs can enter the bloodstream through ingestion or inhalation, triggering inflammation and oxidative stress. Over time, chronic exposure to MNPs can accelerate the progression of atherosclerosis and increase the likelihood of cardiovascular events.\u201d Plastic pollution is considered a \u201cforever\u201d pollutant, meaning once it becomes invasive, it is there to stay. Beach-goer Francesco Pacelli told CNN that it breaks his heart when he sees people leaving their garbage and bottles on the water\u2019s edge. \u201cIt is so important to keep a beach clean, the water it is more beautiful,\u201d he says. \u201cIn my opinion it is very important, especially for fish, animals with all the plastic that floats around.\u201d If humans don\u2019t do their part to stop the scourge of water pollution, the dream Mediterranean vacation could soon turn into a nightmare.

{"id": "travel_article_breakfast-tacos-origins-mexico-texas", "text": "Two simple words can spark mouth-watering bliss or a series of blistering retorts in Texans: Breakfast tacos. In the Lone Star State, who gets the credit for these morning tortilla sensations can be a matter of haba\u00f1ero-hot debate. A highly contested Eater article in 2016 helped start a full-on Breakfast Taco War between Austin and San Antonio. While that particular battle eventually settled down, flare-ups continue. But to get a true picture of this simple food with a complex history, we must go beyond Texas and first look at another place: Mexico. Mouthwatering tacos in Monterrey The breakfast taco is actually part of a long parade of foods (pizza, for instance) whose fuzzy origins and various claims of authenticity spark ferocious debate. There\u2019s one thing we know for darn sure: Today, breakfast tacos are enjoyed on both sides of the Rio Grande River. In her CNN \u201cSearching for Mexico\u201d series, actor Eva Longoria traveled to Monterrey in the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n.     There, she enjoyed a breakfast taco with Mexican food bloggers Gerardo Alvarado and Ernesto Esquivel at Tacos Do\u00f1a Mary La Gritona, which has been serving central Monterrey for nearly 20 years.  \u201cThe breakfast taco may be the simplest of street food, but it\u2019s been been hitting the spot for the workers of Monterrey for nearly a century,\u201d narrates Longoria. \u2018Not a junkie food\u2019   CNN Travel caught up with Esquivel \u2013 born and raised in the border state of Sonora and resident of Monterrey for more than 10 years \u2013 to find out more. \u201cWhen I arrived in Monterrey, I discovered all the different types of tacos that everyone eats in the morning. You can have a taco of eggs. You can have a taco of meat. You can have a taco of potatoes.\u201d Esquivel describes breakfast tacos as \u201ca really fast food, but not a junkie food.\u201d  Esquivel said you can find breakfast tacos in other states in northern Mexico, but Monterrey and the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n are the culinary epicenter with more places to get them and a larger selection of fillings.  Some of the city\u2019s favorites are the machacado (dried beef) with eggs, the barbacoa (slow-cooked meat, often in a pit) and the deshebrada (shredded beef). In other words, you\u2019re in meat country. Timeline of the breakfast taco Esquivel said the breakfast taco goes back to the early 1900s and perhaps even earlier in Monterrey.  Compa\u00f1ia Fundidora, a former iron and steel foundry that dates to 1900 but is now a recreational and educational park, helped the breakfast taco get its start in Monterrey. Employees came \u201cto work really early, and so they had to have a really fast breakfast in the morning, and one fast breakfast in the morning is a breakfast taco.\u201d  And from there, the tacos spread into southern Texas, Esquivel said, which is reflected in the cuisine of today. \u201cI think the flavors here in Monterrey, mostly in the north, are similar to some flavors in Texas.\u201d Along with Do\u00f1a Mary\u2019s, he suggests these spots for a breakfast taco if you\u2019re in Monterrey: Tacos Rafa Ahogados, Tacos Piedra and Tony\u2019s Tacos. North of the Rio Grande   The river may mark a political line between two nations, but it has been no barrier at all to crossings of cuisine and culture. And Texas also shares a passion for the breakfast taco. You can tell that just from all the kerfuffles about them. \u201cNo Texas city can claim the breakfast taco,\u201d says Jos\u00e9 Ralat, the taco editor of Texas Monthly magazine. He places the ultimate credit south of the Rio Grande. \u201cIt comes from Mexico \u2013 where exactly, it\u2019s not really known. Geographically, the most likely source is northern Mexico. There is no literature that I have seen that can point to any particular city in northern Mexico.\u201d As for today, \u201cthey\u2019re popular in [the Mexican states of] Tamaulipas, Nuevo Le\u00f3n and Coahuila, which all border Texas,\u201d he said. Eddie Vega \u2013 who grew up in McAllen, across from the Mexican city of Reynosa in Tamaulipas state \u2013 is known as \u201cTaco Poet of Texas.\u201d He points out that historically, what\u2019s now south Texas was once part of Mexico.  Before 1836, \u201cthe border was further north. All this region was eating a combination of indigenous and Spanish food together.\u201d Vega said that growing up, breakfast tacos weren\u2019t some trendy food to him attracting attention from the likes of The New York Times and other coastal media. \u201cWhen you get to south Texas, and I\u2019m from the Valley, we had breakfast tacos, but they were in my house. My mom would make them. It\u2019s not something we\u2019d go to a restaurant to get because economically that region is very poor and nobody\u2019s eating out. Or not eating out in the morning especially.\u201d Enter Austin Ralat and Vega both said the breakfast taco was staple deep in south Texas and then San Antonio long before Austin got in on the action. So how did Austin become so synonymous with them? Austin has \u201ca great branding mentality, they have a knack for PR. Every year, Austin is flooded with coastal elites checking out South by Southwest,\u201d Ralat said. \u201cThey try some options, and then in their minds, they think it\u2019s an Austin thing. My job is to question the stuff \u2026 and let history speak for itself.\u201d  Ralat said San Antonio has \u201ca bit of an inferiority complex that they\u2019re often overlooked to the benefit of Austin when San Antonio is older, has more culture, it\u2019s more diverse, and the food is better.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, they\u2019re both Tex Mex towns, and breakfast tacos are Tex Mex. But they\u2019re also border food. When the Eater article came out\u201d \u2013 championing Austin as \u201chome\u201d of the breakfast taco \u2013 \u201cSan Antonians lost their minds.\u201d   Vega said the culinary history is too distant for any one place to stamp itself as originator or king purveyor. \u201cI don\u2019t know that one city \u2013 San Antonio, Corpus Christi, McAllen, Brownsville or Laredo \u2013 can claim it. You have differences with them because of ingredients.\u201d Movin\u2019 on Jessica Elizarraras, a Rio Grande Valley native and the executive producer for MySA.com, said many people have put the origins dispute behind them. \u201cI think at this point we\u2019ve mostly moved on from the great taco war of 2016,\u201d Elizarraras said in an email interview with CNN Travel. \u201cIs there occasional ribbing? Absolutely! Are there great tacos across the state? 1000 percent. The Mexican diaspora is far-reaching and so are their tacos.\u201d She cites a 2016 article by Gustavo Arellano as a detailed settlement of the issue that effectively shows Austin is not the start of the breakfast taco.  She also points out the regional differences within Texas. \u201cA flour tortilla in San Antonio tends to lean a bit puffier than its Rio Grande Valley/Coast counterparts. Con Huevos Tacos in San Antonio is the best of both worlds: a thin but sturdy tortilla, filled with fun, flavorful combinations.\u201d They\u2019ve gone nationwide   Ralat said he\u2019s now seeing breakfast tacos coast to coast. He was also recently in Nashville and saw them offered there.  \u201cI hesitate to eat them at a place that calls them Austin-style. \u2026 I want the food to be high quality. I don\u2019t want it to be spin.\u201d  Elizarraras suggests people just enjoy them \u2013 with or without huevos (eggs).  \u201cBreakfast tacos are ephemeral as they come, which makes them that much more magical,\u201d she said. \u201cBean and cheese is a great example of a breakfast taco that doesn\u2019t have eggs. \u2026 Chicharron en salsa (verde or rojo) is another example of a tasty taco that doesn\u2019t require eggs. Barbacoa \u2013 made using a whole cow-head, and more generally, beef cheeks \u2013 is a classic breakfast taco in San Antonio, often paired with Big Red [soda] for a Sunday morning treat.\u201d  The joy of it all In the end, why does the origin of a type of food even matter? \u201cPart of the issue is erasure. Just like with anything else in our Mexican-American culture, to feel left out of a conversation when you know you\u2019ve part of that conversation for a long time.\u201d Vega said. And back south of the Rio Grande, they are a source of unity, Esquivel said.  \u201cI think the breakfast tacos here in Monterrey \u2026 and the northeast of the country is something that unites everyone.\u201d  They\u2019re popular with the poor, the middle class and the rich, he said. \u201cThe place can be ugly. The place can be like in the streets. But you will see people in suits there eating breakfast tacos.\u201d  For Ralat, breakfast tacos are much more than a great way to start the morning. \u201cI think history, especially food history, is important to know because it provides another mirror for our culture. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to me that tortillas are the foundation of Mexican culture, and to break bread with someone is a sacred act. So let\u2019s take it literally, and say that you share tacos with someone else. That\u2019s so nice. And it\u2019s just so joyful.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/article/breakfast-tacos-origins-mexico-texas/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_blackwell-school-nps-historic-site-marfa-texas", "text": "At first glance, it\u2019s a rather unmarkable, plain-looking, one-story building that sits in an unadorned lot in the dry West Texas town of Marfa. It has off-white adobe walls and a metal roof. On the front, it has two narrow vertical windows and a wooden door. A handful of utilitarian steps with no railings lead inside. And yet Blackwell School is the newest site in the US National Park system because of the remarkable story of what happened here. Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland formally established the school as a National Historic Site on Wednesday, according to a news release from the National Park Service. It\u2019s one of 76 sites with that designation. It joins the ranks of such historically important places as the Eleanor Roosevelt National Historic Site in New York, the Ford\u2019s Theatre National Historic Site in Washington, DC, and the Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site in Alabama. The US National Park Service now has a total of 430 units, including 63 National Parks, under its wide umbrella. History of Blackwell School Built in 1909, the school \u201cserves as a significant example of how racism and cultural disparity dominated education and social systems in the United States during this period of de facto segregation from 1889 to 1965,\u201d the NPS release said. Unlike schools in much of the South that primarily focused on segregation of African Americans, Blackwell was established for Mexican and Mexican-American students. By receiving the designation, Blackwell School has permanent protection and can provide physical testimony that helps tell the history of Texas school districts that set up elementary schools for Mexican American children, the release said. \u201cA complete history of America must include everyone\u2019s story. The designation of the Blackwell School National Historic Site is an important step in telling a more diverse and inclusive history of the Mexican American experience in our country,\u201d said\u00a0Chuck Sams, director of the National Park Service. The site has the original 1909 adobe schoolhouse and a smaller 1927 classroom building known as the Band Hall. The buildings hold photographs, memorabilia and panels that display quotes and stories from students and teachers, NPS said. Marfa: Tourist attraction Marfa, population just over 1,700, is about 45 miles (72 kilometers) east of the U.S.-Mexico border and about 400 miles west of San Antonio on a lonely stretch of high-altitude highway. The town has become something of an essential stop for a West Texas road trip, especially for lovers of avant-garde art. Artist Donald Judd helped get things started in the 1970s with his installation of minimalist aluminum boxes inside buildings at the former Fort D.A. Russell military post.\u00a0It\u2019s now called The Chinati Foundation (La Fundaci\u00f3n Chinati) and features permanent, large-scale works of art. The town is also home to Prada Marfa, a stocked faux boutique by artist duo Elmgreen & Dragset that comments on materialism. Various art galleries also dot the town, covering a range of styles from world tribal art to minimalist, contemporary works.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/blackwell-school-nps-historic-site-marfa-texas/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_travel_south-korea-overtourism-bukchon-hanok-village-intl-hnk", "text": "As the issue of overtourism sweeps cities and countries around the world, authorities in South Korea have announced stricter controls and measures to protect a historic traditional village district in downtown Seoul from throngs of tourists, who have flooded its streets and caused friction with local residents over the years. Known for its picturesque and well-preserved traditional Korean houses called \u201chanok,\u201d Bukchon Hanok Village is one of Seoul\u2019s most popular tourist hot spots \u2013 attracting thousands of visitors every day. But tourists greatly outnumber residents and complaints about noise, littering and privacy issues in the vicinity have escalated over the years. Located in the Jongno district in downtown Seoul, Bukchon sits near other cultural landmarks like the Jongmyo royal ancestral\u00a0shrine and the grand Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung palaces. In a bid to ease tensions and control crowds, district officials will start to restrict tourist access to the popular village from as early as October this year. It will be designated the country\u2019s first-ever \u201cspecial management area\u201d under South Korea\u2019s Tourism Promotion Act. Strict curfews for non-residents will be reinforced daily between 5 p.m. to 10 a.m. Chartered buses carrying tourists will be restricted in several sections. The aim is to reduce traffic and make Bukchon \u201cfoot-centered,\u201d officials said. Three color-coded zones \u2013 red, orange and yellow \u2013 will also be designated to allow local authorities to control and monitor crowds in the most densely populated areas. Fines will also be imposed on violators, officials said. Following public complaints, signs in four languages warning tourists about noise levels were installed in 2018. The area once served as residential quarters for high-ranking authorities and nobility during the era of the Joseon kings, who ruled Korea from the 1300s until 1910. Today, the area is home to around 6,000 residents as well as businesses like inns, craft stores and cafes \u2013 with several prominent photo spots. However, some of those living and working in the area have dismissed the new measures as being \u201cempty talk.\u201d Cafe owner Lee Youn-hee told CNN that tourists usually leave after sunset anyway, as they\u2019re mostly there to take photos. \u201cIn the winter, visitors are gone by 5 p.m. and during summer maybe by 6 p.m. because the days are longer,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThis won\u2019t make a big difference.\u201d A growing global problem But Seoul isn\u2019t alone. Many global cities are struggling to find a balance between much-needed tourism revenue and maintaining their appeal to residents. Tourists visiting Barcelona this week were sprayed with water by protesters marching through popular areas to demonstrate against mass tourism in the city. Italy\u2019s lagoon city of Venice introduced a\u00a0trial fee\u00a0in April to limit the number of day trippers. Overtourism has long been a problem in Japan, with the situation deteriorating rapidly since the country reopened post-pandemic. The slopes of Mount Fuji have seen increasing human traffic jams, foothills littered with garbage as well as bad tourist behavior. Out-of-control tourists have been especially problematic in Kyoto, one of Japan\u2019s most popular tourist cities, famed for its iconic Gion geisha district. Reports of \u201cgeisha paparazzi\u201d fueled public anger and have prompted city officials to take action. Back in Seoul, about 6.6 million domestic and overseas tourists are believed to have visited Bukchon in 2023, according to government data. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that tourists be respectful to those living here,\u201d Sindere Schoultz, a tourist from Sweden, told CNN. \u201cWe want to come here and have a good time but we don\u2019t want to step on somebody\u2019s toes and be disrespectful.\u201d Another Swedish tourist, Emma H\u00e4gg, said she understood the reasons behind the ban. \u201cI don\u2019t mind it,\u201d she said. \u201cI completely understand why and it\u2019s good that they still want us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/travel/south-korea-overtourism-bukchon-hanok-village-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_married-southwest-pilots", "text": "On their first flight together, Joel Atkinson and Shelley Atkinson couldn\u2019t contain their excitement. They enthused to the flight attendants. They posed for photos. They told passengers via a pre-flight announcement. \u201cWe made a big deal about it,\u201d Joel tells CNN Travel. Then, right before take off, Joel and Shelley sat side by side in the flight deck, just the two of them. They\u2019d come full circle, and were about to embark on an exciting new chapter. \u201cIt felt amazing,\u201d Shelley tells CNN Travel. \u201cAs we prepared to take off, I was giddy, euphoric,\u201d says Joel. Joel and Shelley met as twentysomethings flying jets in the US Air Force. They became fast friends, then, over time, fell in love. Today, they\u2019ve been married for 27 years and counting. They\u2019ve brought up two kids together. And now they\u2019re both pilots for Southwest Airlines. They regularly fly together, with Joel as captain and Shelley as first officer. The couple say working together is \u201camazing.\u201d They treat layovers as \u201cdate nights.\u201d They learn from one another\u2019s respective \u201cwisdom and judgment.\u201d And no, they don\u2019t argue mid-flight. \u201cPeople ask us, how does it work, flying together?\u201d says Joel. \u201cWe know a few pilot couples and some of them fly together, some of them don\u2019t. I\u2019ve heard people say, \u2018Oh I could never fly with my wife or my husband.\u2019\u201d For Joel and Shelley, working together is seamless \u2013 a joy that comes easily to them both. \u201cWe\u2019re best friends,\u201d says Shelley. \u201cThere\u2019s just that unspoken bond,\u201d says Joel. Inspired by \u2018Top Gun\u2019 Shelley grew up in Iowa and moved to Colorado \u2013 Joel\u2019s home state \u2013 as a teenager. The two spent their high school years unaware of one another, but they graduated the same year, and both opted to study at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado in the late 1980s. Joel says he was very influenced by the 1985 Tom Cruise movie \u201cTop Gun\u201d \u2013 \u201cwhich made flying jets look like a lot of fun.\u201d For Shelley, who was an athlete, the appeal of the Air Force Academy was less about flying \u2013 which she only really discovered once she was enrolled \u2013 and more an opportunity to play college basketball. \u201cI didn\u2019t attend the Academy to pursue flying, initially. Once I was there I realized it was a great opportunity for a fun and challenging career,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the introduction to flying there made me want to pursue it further.\u201d Joel and Shelley spent four years studying at the Air Force Academy without actually crossing paths, although Joel was vaguely aware of Shelley. \u201cThere\u2019s not that many women at the Air Force Academy, so I kind of knew who she was,\u201d he says. The two finally met a few years later, after they\u2019d both completed pilot training in different states. They got the same first assignment \u2013 flying Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft in Texas. When Shelley arrived in Texas, Joel had been there for a few months. \u201cSo I was there, kind of established, and she came into the office where I was working,\u201d he recalls. \u201cShe came in and turned in the paperwork, and we said, \u2018Hi,\u2019 just exchanged some pleasantries.\u201d Joel was struck by Shelley right away. \u201cShe\u2019s tall. She looks great. She left the room and this other coworker was just looking at me smiling. And I said, \u2018What?\u2019 And he could tell.\u201d Looking back, Joel thinks it was the \u201ceye contact\u201d he had with Shelley that gave his feelings away. Or maybe just \u201cthe look on my face.\u201d \u201cThere was something there,\u201d says Joel, smiling. \u201cBut I just kind of laughed it off. I was like, \u2018Nah, we\u2019re just going to be friends.\u2019\u201d Joel was also a bit intimidated by Shelley \u2013 he was \u201cattracted to her right away,\u201d but didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d ever be interested in him. \u201cShe\u2019s taller than me. And I had never dated anyone taller than me,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s an athlete, she\u2019s a natural leader, and just an impressive person.\u201d But Joel\u2019s warm nature appealed to Shelley. She felt comfortable around him right away. They became close friends. \u201cJoel has a really great sense of humor,\u201d says Shelley. \u201cI love that about him. And he just really has a sensitive heart to people, all people around him, he looks out for people.\u201d \u201cThat really attracted me to him. And also, he used to have a nice dark head of hair. I really liked that too. But he has a very distinguished look now, and he\u2019s just as handsome as ever.\u201d About a year after they first met, Joel and Shelley were deployed abroad, together. That\u2019s when they \u201ckind of started dating,\u201d as Joel puts it. While there wasn\u2019t much opportunity to go on actual dates on active service, they bonded. \u201cConversations, talking about everything, basically,\u201d says Shelley. \u201cWe really got to know each other\u2019s heart that way. And I think it just made it clear that this is what we were supposed to do.\u201d Back home in the US, the two \u201cstarted officially dating.\u201d \u201cWe just kind of knew that this was going to be it,\u201d says Joel. \u201cAnd within a few months, we got married.\u201d Joel and Shelley became instructor Air Force pilots in Mississippi. Then, in the early 2000s, Shelley gave birth to the couple\u2019s kids, two twins, a boy and a girl. Shelley left flying around this time, but she stayed in the military, working for the US Air National Guard. \u201cI wanted to be at home,\u201d says Shelley. The path to pregnancy wasn\u2019t easy for the couple and Joel calls their kids a \u201chuge blessing.\u201d \u201cWe went through in vitro a couple of times,\u201d he says. \u201cIt took a few years for us to actually get pregnant.\u201d The family relocated back to Colorado and Joel transitioned from military flying to commercial flying, becoming a pilot with Southwest Airlines in 2006. Returning to the air Cut to 2021. The pandemic years were tough going for Joel and Shelley, emotionally speaking. While the couple stayed healthy, their kids were in their late teens and struggled with the upheaval. Plus, Covid was impacting the aviation industry, so Joel was flying less. Around this time, Shelley left her job at the National Guard. She and Joel were wholly focused on their family and their kids\u2019 wellbeing. But in time, the pandemic waned and Joel started flying more regularly. Joel and Shelley\u2019s kids graduated high school and started the next phase of their lives. It was a transitional period for the Atkinson family, and in turn, Shelley started considering her future. She found herself dreaming about flying. She hadn\u2019t been behind the controls of a plane in over two decades, but she felt a call to return. She started wondering if, like Joel, she could become a commercial pilot. When Shelley voiced the idea to Joel, he was immediately enthusiastic. \u201cI said, \u2018Come fly with me,\u2019\u201d says Joel, joking \u201ccue the music.\u201d Then, by coincidence, later that day, Joel saw a social media post from his airline, Southwest, about a pilot who\u2019d taken a two decade break to raise a family, then returned to flying. \u201cShe literally had the same story as me,\u201d says Shelley. It felt like a sign. While Joel didn\u2019t know this other pilot directly, he was able to reach out to her via his work network and pass on contact details to Shelley, who subsequently texted the other pilot, asking for guidance and advice. Then, with encouragement from her new friend \u2013 plus Joel\u2019s wholehearted support \u2013 Shelley committed to returning to the skies full time. While Shelley had years of Air Force experience, she hadn\u2019t flown airplanes for 20 years. She had had to hit the books, take additional tests and ensure her qualifications were up to speed. But before long Shelley was hired by SkyWest Airlines, flying regional jets. Then she joined Joel at Southwest in 2023. \u201cIt was crazy. It happened way faster than I thought it would. It\u2019s been amazing,\u201d says Shelley. \u201cIt was meant to be,\u201d says Joel. Flying together Joel and Shelley credit their success as a co-pilot team to their nearly three decades of marriage, as well as years of co-parenting. \u201cRaising two teenagers during Covid, I tell people that was a lot harder than what we\u2019re doing now,\u201d says Joel. Plus, the two met as colleagues \u2013 so they know how to balance commitment to a job with enjoying each other\u2019s company. Still, as a married couple in the military, Joel and Shelley never flew in the same aircraft. \u201cThe military kind of frowns upon it,\u201d says Joel. \u201cIt\u2019s a little morbid, but they don\u2019t want you to both go down in a plane crash.\u201d No such guidelines exist in commercial aviation, and so once Shelley joined Southwest, she and Joel were able to work side by side. Joel\u2019s seniority allows him to regularly bid for flights with Shelley. And the two find Joel\u2019s years of commercial aviation experience pairs well with Shelley\u2019s fresh take. \u201cShe looks to me and relies on me for the experience that I have. But I also know that she is a very sharp person, she just went through a lot of training. So her knowledge is fresh. And she also has that wisdom and judgment,\u201d says Joel. Since the excitement of their first flight, Joel and Shelley tend not to \u201cmake a big deal\u201d about being a husband and wife pilot duo \u2013 unless it\u2019s preempted by their colleagues. \u201cWe wait for them to ask,\u201d says Shelley. As the couple share the same last name, often crew members put two and two together. As Joel\u2019s the more senior of the two, he often runs the pre-flight briefing. Sometimes he\u2019ll end it with a quick, throwaway: \u201cYes, we\u2019re married.\u201d The crew usually \u201cstart laughing,\u201d says Joel. When Joel and Shelley are taking off and landing, they\u2019re focused on the job at hand. \u201cIt\u2019s very technical,\u201d says Joel. \u201cWe\u2019re running checklists.\u201d But when the airplane reaches cruising altitude, \u201cthere\u2019s some downtime\u201d and Joel and Shelley will make the most of it, talking through their thoughts on life, their kids, their future plans and everything else that\u2019s on their mind. \u201cIt\u2019s so great, because all the years that I was flying, and she was at home, anything I wanted to talk to her about when I\u2019m up in the air, it had to wait,\u201d says Joel. \u201cYou\u2019re saving up conversations until you\u2019re home. It\u2019s like now we\u2019re making up for lost time.\u201d Then, when they land, Joel and Shelley make the most of the layovers. Southwest largely flies domestically, so the couple enjoy traveling the length and breadth of the US together. \u201cIt is a great job, because you go see different places and spend time in different cities,\u201d says Joel, but before Shelley joined Southwest, Joel says layovers sometimes felt like \u201cwasted time, because it was just me, and I couldn\u2019t share it with her.\u201d \u201cBut now we\u2019re together when we\u2019re on the road \u2013 it\u2019s so fun. Because every night on the road, it\u2019s a date night together,\u201d he says. Now, instead of counting the days until he\u2019s home, Joel says his \u201chome is right here\u201d because \u201cshe\u2019s with me.\u201d Family connection While Joel and Shelley have flown together countless times since Shelley joined Southwest, they\u2019ve yet to fly with their kids in tow. That\u2019s on the to-do list \u2013 plus, their son is also training to be a pilot, so there\u2019s a chance Shelley and Joel might pilot an aircraft with him in the future. For Shelley, an additional perk of the last couple of years is her adult kids getting to \u201cview her as a pilot for the first time.\u201d Shelley and Joel\u2019s children grew up knowing their parents met flying jets \u2013 but\u00a0while they saw their father regularly piloting airplanes for Southwest, they never saw Shelley flying. Shelley is really happy her children get to see her doing a job she loves. Shelley\u2019s also proud to be a female pilot in an industry that\u2019s still very male-dominated. She hopes to inspire other people, especially mothers who may have taken a break from the workplace to raise a family, by demonstrating that returning to a passion is possible. \u201cI hope it encourages other women that there is this opportunity out there \u2013 you can come back and you can still do it,\u201d she says. Shelley says she\u2019s really loved rediscovering her love of flying. \u201cThe view from 36,000 feet is pretty awesome,\u201d she says. \u201cFlying over parts of the country - I just love looking down and going, \u2018Oh, what town is that?\u2019\u201d Shelley and Joel particularly enjoy flying in and out of San Diego, California, but they also love it when Southwest takes them to New York. Before Christmas, they enjoyed a stopover in New York City and went searching for the settings of their favorite movies, from \u201cElf\u201d to \u201cSerendipity.\u201d \u201cI love traveling, seeing new places,\u201d says Joel, who adds that he\u2019s gone from avoiding working weekends to voluntarily signing up for Saturday and Sunday flight shifts. He and Shelley now spend Saturday nights watching jazz in Portland, going on hikes in Sacramento or drinking cocktails in Palm Springs. Joel\u2019s always loved flying \u2013 especially what he calls \u201cthe art and science\u201d of aviation. He also loves \u201cserving people, getting them to where they need to be,\u201d but he admits flying during the pandemic was hard going. For Joel, having Shelley now by his side at work has \u201cbeen just a complete turnaround.\u201d Now even the ride to work is fun as the couple car share, coffees in hand. Joel and Shelley, who post about their adventures on their Instagram account @luvpilots, are currently planning to pick up a flight together on Valentine\u2019s Day. Joel bought the two of them heart-printed ties especially \u2013 they\u2019re \u201csilly, but fun,\u201d says Joel. The couple enjoy chronicling their travels on social media \u2013 celebrating their marriage, their respective careers and their adventures. \u201cWe feel blessed. We\u2019re thankful for the opportunity,\u201d says Joel. \u201cWe\u2019re thankful to Southwest Airlines for letting us do this together.\u201d \u201cIf you love doing something, why not do it with the person you love?\u201d says Shelley.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/married-southwest-pilots/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_south-korea-convenience-stores-intl-hnk-dst", "text": "Imagine this: you need to pick up a package, top up your metro card, grab lunch and take out some cash. In most places, that would probably mean separate trips to the post office, the subway station, a restaurant and an ATM. But in South Korea, all that \u2013 and more \u2013 can be done at your nearest convenience store. And you probably won\u2019t have to travel far to find one. South Korea has become the global king of convenience stores, both online and off \u2013 with social media influencers and tourists joining locals in flocking to a rapidly growing number of stores across the country. By the end of last year, there were more than 55,200 convenience stores in the nation of 52 million, according to the Korea Convenience Store Industry Association \u2013 roughly one\u00a0for every 950 people. That\u2019s more than the total number of McDonald\u2019s branches worldwide\u00a0\u2013 and gives South Korea the highest density of stores per capita, overtaking Japan and Taiwan, both also famous for their abundant and versatile convenience stores. \u201cThe convenience store industry in South Korea stands out for its remarkable density and innovative strategies,\u201d said Chang Woo-cheol, a professor of tourism and the food service industry at Kwangwoon University in Seoul. \u201cThey have become an essential retail channel, with the second-largest share in offline retail sales in the country.\u201d It\u2019s a far cry from places like the United States, where convenience stores are usually attached to gas stations or strip malls and are rarely seen in residential areas, partly due to zoning laws. In large South Korean cities like Seoul, convenience stores are on every corner, sometimes with multiple outlets from competing companies dotting the same street. \u201cConvenience stores are open 24 hours a day and play an essential role in our busy lives,\u201d Chang added \u2013 calling the South Korean industry a \u201cglobal success story.\u201d One-stop shops There are a few things that set South Korean convenience stores apart. For starters, they are a one-stop shop offering everything from food and drinks to home goods and lifestyle services. At these stores, customers can charge their phones, pay utility bills, withdraw cash, make online orders and receive deliveries \u2013 and, at certain locations, even charge their electric scooters, exchange foreign currency and send international mail. \u201cConvenience stores in Korea are not only a place where people can (sit) around a table amongst the clutter of beer cans on a late summer night, but also provide essential services,\u201d said Deloitte Korea in a 2020 report, describing the country\u2019s stores as \u201cpampering their customers with extreme convenience.\u201d Then there\u2019s the food section \u2013 a wide variety ranging from instant miso soup to cup noodles in every flavor imaginable, snacks like kimbap and onigiri, and ready-to-eat meal kits. Combine that with in-store seating areas, microwaves and hot water dispensers, and these stores have become a go-to spot for office workers having a quick lunch, partygoers needing a late-night boost and students fueling up before grueling cram school classes. Demand has surged over the years as South Korea has urbanized, said Chang, the hospitality professor. More than 80% of the population now live in urban centers, with many residents leaving rural areas to settle down in fast-paced cities. Another factor is demographics. Fewer South Koreans are getting married or starting families, meaning there are more single-person households than ever \u2013 and often on tighter budgets, given the economic hardships facing many young adults. As of 2021, about 35% of all South Korean households were single residents, according to a McKinsey report released last March. And unlike couples or large families, who may prefer to cook at home and buy in bulk from grocery stores, single residents gravitate toward the cheap, easy option of convenience stores or ordering online. The Covid-19 pandemic contributed to this trend,\u00a0with people preferring to order online or to buy things quickly from stores close to home, the report added. Companies have capitalized on this high demand by strategically opening shops inside other existing business venues or entertainment spaces. For instance, Seoul has convenience stores in karaoke bars and the city\u2019s arts center, the Deloitte report said. All this has translated to huge profits. Between 2010 and 2021, Korean convenience store revenue leaped more than fourfold\u00a0from $5.8 billion to $24.7 billion, surpassing traditional supermarkets and department stores, according to McKinsey, citing London-based market research company Euromonitor. Social media phenomenon These convenience stores aren\u2019t just popular in real life \u2013 they\u2019re also gaining traction on social media, reflecting the global phenomenon many call the \u201cKorean wave.\u201d South Korean exports have swept the world in the past two decades, from K-pop and Korean TV dramas to beauty products, fashion and food. In the past year, the global obsession with Korean items has turned its attention to the country\u2019s convenience stores. A quick search on YouTube, TikTok or Instagram shows an endless supply of videos about Korean convenience stores. In these clips, influencers show off the in-store instant ramen stations, review\u00a0snacks and drinks, or follow online trends such as only eating convenience store foods for a whole day. These videos have proved to be a winning strategy for their creators. Jiny Maeng, an Australia-based content creator who was born in South Korea, began making videos on the topic after seeing similar clips going viral online. They are her most-viewed content, with her top three YouTube videos racking up a total of 76 million views \u2013 and an additional few million views each on TikTok and Instagram. \u201cKorea became a trend itself \u2026 on social media,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess that\u2019s also why (convenience stores) are so popular, because people idolize going to Korea now, it\u2019s just one of the dream locations people want to go to. So, seeing these videos kind of overtake online is a really cool experience for a Korean, actually.\u201d Part of what audiences enjoy is the sensory satisfaction of Maeng displaying convenience store products, she said \u2013 including the crinkling of packaging being torn open or the rattle of plastic \u201cice cups\u201d before they\u2019re filled with drinks. But they were also popular among her Australian and American viewers for the sheer novelty factor, she said. Buying, cooking and eating instant ramen noodles at a convenience store is \u201cmind-blowing\u201d for those used to a more spartan, Western-style store, she said. She pointed to businesses in Sydney, where she lives, as an example. Many cafes and other stores close by 3 p.m. \u2013 ludicrously early by Korean standards. And while Australia has 7-Eleven stores, like in the US, they are usually attached to gas stations and have \u201cvery limited\u201d processed food options like meat pies, sandwiches, donuts and slushies, she said. Chang, the professor, said these online videos have helped drive the popularity of convenience stores in Korea. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of both their distinctiveness and effective marketing through social media that has boosted their popularity,\u201d he said. Indeed, Korean convenience store companies have grown so successful they are even expanding overseas.

{"id": "2024_06_27_travel_restaurants-bars-age-restrictions-bliss-cec", "text": "When Johnny B. Barounis opened The Auction House in New York\u2019s Upper East Side in 1993, he knew he wanted to deter a certain type of customer in their early 20s \u2014 in his words, \u201cthose kids that had their flannel shirts tied around their waists, wearing their Villanova hats backwards, walking around in the street with their Amstel Light in their hand.\u201d He deliberately cultivated an atmosphere at his bar that he felt might intimidate a fresh-out-of-college 20-something: rich velvet drapes, crystal chandeliers, antique furniture. On Fridays and Saturdays, the message was more explicit: Only patrons 25 and up were allowed in the door. \u201cI didn\u2019t need a 21-year-old to come in with two of his friends, to make a ruckus and then get sick in the bathroom,\u201d Barounis says. Barounis says his age policy was rare back then, and some at the time questioned his decision to keep out younger customers. Three decades later, the bar is something of an institution \u2014 and the 25-and-up policy on weekends was so well-received that he implemented it at his sister bar, The Back Room. Today, plenty of bars and lounges around the US impose similar \u2014 if not stricter \u2014 age restrictions, hoping to curb unruly behavior sometimes exhibited by newly legal drinkers and appeal to an older crowd. But such age limits are still unusual at restaurants, as evidenced by the recent controversy around a Missouri eatery. Bliss, an upscale Caribbean restaurant that opened last month in the suburbs of St. Louis, provoked numerous headlines and fervent debate for limiting entry to women 30 and up and men 35 and up. As Barounis sees it, the uproar over the restaurant\u2019s age policy suggests it might have been too extreme. \u201cThe difference between 21 and 25 is greater than 25 and 35,\u201d he says. \u201cWhere do you draw the line?\u201d How the owner of Bliss chooses to run his business is, of course, his prerogative, Barounis and others in the hospitality industry say. But the conversation around the restaurant\u2019s unconventional age policy raises some interesting questions: To what extent can businesses dictate who their customers are? And to what extent should they? Plenty of customers appreciate age restrictions Generally, society seems to have reached a tacit (if begrudging) acceptance of age restrictions at certain establishments. Bars like Barounis\u2019 Auction House have long operated without issue, catering to customers seeking a night out without potential disruptions from patrons who haven\u2019t yet learned how to handle their liquor. Some restaurants have seen increased reservations and sales after instituting bans on young children. And adults-only hotels and resorts are popular for a reason. In fact, Bliss owner Marvin Pate tells CNN his positive dining experiences at adults-only resorts are what inspired his restaurant\u2019s age policy. He and his wife Tina Pate, both 42, found that there was a demand among people their age for an elevated spot where they could kick back, relax and hear the music they grew up listening to. \u201cWhy not just make a lounge type of feel at a resort but in a restaurant setting?\u201d Pate says of his thinking behind Bliss. \u201cMajority of (places) around the country, if you go to a place that\u2019s 35 and up, it\u2019s actually a lounge with fried food. We thought about the concept of a restaurant that\u2019s daily, where people could \u2026 get a luxe environment and just enjoy themselves with actual cooked food.\u201d Judging by the comments on the Bliss Facebook page, many customers welcome the laid-back, mature environment that Bliss promises. Several people urged the restaurant not to backtrack on its age policy despite the criticism it has received, while a few joked that they wouldn\u2019t take issue with an even higher age limit. Still, some in the comments objected to the idea that age was a reliable proxy for maturity level. Others questioned whether Bliss\u2019 stringent policy of carding people at the door was necessary to achieve the sophisticated ambiance that Pate envisioned. Would 20-somethings even want to hang out in a place where a majority of the clientele is in its 30s and 40s? \u201cAn age restriction for a restaurant is a bit of a reach unless it\u2019s a bar and event space too IMO,\u201d one commenter said. \u201cIf they want to deter disruptive crowds it\u2019s better to raise the price range not the age range.\u201d However objectionable some patrons find these age restrictions, such policies don\u2019t generally constitute age discrimination, says Trey Lindley, a civil litigator in North Carolina with the business law firm Lord & Lindley. Businesses generally have the right to set their own guidelines for service, as long as it isn\u2019t on the basis of federally protected categories such as race, religion, national origin or disability, according to Lindley. Think of the \u201cno shirts, no shoes, no service\u201d signs that proliferated in the early 1970s or Covid-era mask mandates. Though federal law prohibits age discrimination within the context of employment, Lindley notes that age isn\u2019t typically a protected characteristic when it comes to federal and state laws banning discrimination in public places. Provided that an establishment has a logical reason for its rules and enforces them uniformly, he says it generally has the right to do so. \u201cI think the biggest concern for restaurants who want to do this is potential blowback,\u201d he adds. Different age policies for men and women raise questions When bars or restaurants institute age requirements, it inevitably elicits some grumbling from those who feel excluded. Just last month, Donerick\u2019s Pub in the suburbs of Columbus, Ohio, made headlines for raising its age limit to 30 and older on Fridays and Saturdays. And each time a restaurant announces a policy restricting children, it inspires intense debate across social media. While there seemed to be a few people who were upset that Bliss implemented age restrictions at all, some of the criticism focused on the fact that the rules are different for men and women. Bliss defended its policy of allowing women 30-plus and men 35-plus, writing in a May Facebook post that it intends to create a \u201cgrown and sexy atmosphere\u201d and helps to \u201cmaintain a sophisticated environment, uphold our standards, and support the sustainability of our unique ambiance.\u201d Pate says the restaurant initially planned to institute a 35-and-up policy for both men and women, but lowered the threshold for women to cater to what he called \u201cladies night out\u201d \u2014 referring to young professional women gathering with female friends for happy hours and other social events. The five-year gap struck some customers as arbitrary, with some women who met the age requirements expressing frustration that they couldn\u2019t visit Bliss with their male partners. \u201cWhy can I come at age 30, but my husband who will be 33 this year can\u2019t?\u201d one user commented on a Facebook post from Bliss. \u201cAssuming that all young people are going to cause problems is cutting out a huge crowd of people who would bring in more business.\u201d \u201cMay I ask why the men have to be older than the women? I would love to be able to come with my fianc\u00e9 (who\u2019s older than me), but he\u2019s not 35 for 2 more years,\u201d another person wrote. Bliss\u2019 age discrepancy may be especially stark, but separate policies for men and women aren\u2019t unheard of among bars and nightclubs. Barounis, for example, recalled working at a bar in Long Island decades ago that barred women under 23 and men under 25. And for years, bars and nightclubs enticed both male and female customers by offering discounted or free drinks for women. Even if Bliss\u2019 rules likely don\u2019t constitute age discrimination, Lindley says the gender discrepancy could open the restaurant to litigation. But Pate maintains that the policies at Bliss aren\u2019t intended to discriminate against anyone. He says the goal is simply to provide a relaxing atmosphere for older customers and adds that he didn\u2019t think the restrictions were out of the norm. Experts say age-exclusive establishments are unlikely to become a trend Though restaurant and bar owners can generally set their own rules on who they allow in, hospitality industry experts that spoke to CNN are doubtful that age-exclusive establishments will become a trend. Excluding patrons under 35 or 30 omits an otherwise desirable slice of the market, says Jason Kaplan, CEO of the restaurant consulting firm JK Consulting. While bars may be able to get away with higher age restrictions, he says he wouldn\u2019t recommend such a strict policy for restaurants given that profit margins on food are much lower. Younger generations tend to spend more money on drinking and eating out, and Kaplan says it\u2019s unlikely that most businesses would want to give that up. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about that sweet spot between young professionals that you\u2019re basically going to eliminate, who are willing to pay for experiences,\u201d Kaplan says. Eddie Fahmy, CEO of A2Z Restaurant Consulting, agrees. He understands why a bar might impose age limits only on certain days, but to him, shutting out a younger demographic entirely is a risky business decision. \u201cIf you\u2019re a restaurant and you want to make money selling food and serving customers, it just doesn\u2019t make sense to me,\u201d he adds. But other establishments with strict age policies say the business model works for them. Toya Taylor, owner of the San Antonio-based 30-plus lounge Horizons & More, says she knows she\u2019s probably losing some business by barring people under 30, but she also feels that doing so reduces her liability. \u201cThe places that are starting (to use age restrictions) are going to see good results, especially if they stick to it,\u201d she adds. Meanwhile, Barounis notes that the buzz generated over Bliss\u2019 age requirements could work in its favor, and he\u2019s eager to see whether the restaurant finds success with its unusual policy or whether it ultimately reverses course. Pate, Bliss\u2019 owner, says he\u2019s not going anywhere. And when those younger customers finally turn 30 or 35, Bliss will be there, waiting to welcome them in. \u201cI feel like we have (filled) a big void that was needed inside American society and just the culture in general,\u201d he adds. \u201cPeople were asking for this, and we just gave the people what they want.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/travel/restaurants-bars-age-restrictions-bliss-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_us-couple-moved-to-thailand-built-home", "text": "With his retirement fast approaching, Jim Dolan, from the US, felt as though his future was more or less mapped out. He and his wife Som Dolan would build a house in her native country, Thailand, and split their time between the Southeast Asian destination and the States. But the couple ended up leaving the US for good after their home in Houston was severely flooded during Hurricane Harvey, a Category 4 storm that hit Texas in 2017. \u201cOur finances were such that we couldn\u2019t live what was thought to be our dream life,\u201d Jim Dolan, who previously worked for NASA, tells CNN Travel. Virtual romance He hadn\u2019t ever really envisioned being based in Thailand permanently. In fact, Jim Dolan \u2013 originally from Worcester, Massachusetts \u2013 hadn\u2019t even visited the country before meeting his future wife, from Bangkok, online in 2006. \u201cWe got to know each other, virtually at first,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd we visited together a number of times before we decided that we were soulmates.\u201d The pair later got engaged, and Som Dolan moved to the US on a fianc\u00e9e visa. \u201cI was not ready to leave the United States at that point,\u201d Jim Dolan explains. \u201cI had a good job and a good career. So I wanted to bring her there. \u201c The couple tied the knot that same year and quickly began building a life in the US together. \u201cThe first couple of years were kind of challenging to me, because of the language,\u201d admits Som Dolan, who speaks both Thai and English, but had only used English for work purposes previously. \u201cIt was very hard for me to understand because the people speak very fast.\u201d It took several years for Som Dolan, who previously worked in IT, to find her feet career-wise, and she briefly worked as a waitress in a Thai restaurant, and as her husband\u2019s assistant. \u201cI had a good job (in Thailand,)\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I moved here, it was hard for me to find a job where I could use my experience.\u201d The Dolans spent 10 years living in the US together and had been looking forward to \u201ca dual Thailand and US kind of lifestyle\u201d in the future. However, that all changed after a series of financial setbacks. Jim Dolan explains that he lost \u201ca lot of money in the stock market in the financial crash in 2009.\u201d Although he says he was able to recover much of this in the following years, the damage inflicted on their home after Hurricane Harvey devastated the Texas Gulf Coast resulted in another financial blow. Financial woes \u201cWe had to rebuild our house in Houston while still living in it,\u201d he says. \u201cThink of trying to change a tire on a race car while the car is going round the track. It was a challenge.\u201d The couple didn\u2019t have flood insurance, something Jim Dolan describes as a \u201cregrettable decision.\u201d Needless to say, the repair work cost them a considerable amount of money, and the Dolans realized that they wouldn\u2019t be able to afford to live as comfortably as they\u2019d hoped if they remained in the US. The pair, who sold their home in Houston and moved to Washington, DC in 2019, soon began looking into the prospect of relocating to Thailand permanently. \u201cIt was not a hard choice to make,\u201d says Jim Dolan. \u201cI had traveled to Thailand a number of times, I really liked being here. \u201cI like the food. I like the culture. I love the climate. It\u2019s a beautiful country. And obviously, Som is a native here. So she\u2019s very comfortable here. \u201cAnd it\u2019s so much more affordable than the United States. It was ultimately a pretty easy decision.\u201d When the global Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020, the Dolans decided to bring forward their plan to build a house in Thailand. \u201cIt was right around the time that I was just approaching retirement age,\u201d explains Jim Dolan. \u201cAnd so we just decided to make the move at that time. We had enough money to build a house, and we were ready to do it.\u201d The couple then bought some land \u201csight unseen\u201d in Sam Roi Yot, located in the province of Prachuap Khiri Khan, for around $50,000. Big move Jim Dolan explains that they deliberately chose the area in the Gulf of Thailand as its position meant that they were less likely to be badly impacted by a natural disaster again. \u201cThere\u2019s no risk of earthquakes or tsunamis on this side of the peninsula,\u201d he says, explaining that while they hadn\u2019t been to Sam Roi Yot before, the couple were familiar with the area, which is about 240 kilometers (150 miles) south of the capital, Bangkok. \u201cSo we don\u2019t have to worry about that. We don\u2019t have fires. We don\u2019t have hurricanes.\u201d Jim Dolan was able to obtain a Thailand Marriage Visa, which currently requires applicants to have at least 400,000THB (around $11,000) in a Thai bank account or a monthly income of no less than 40,000THB (about $1,100). Once they had their affairs in order, the Dolans packed up their lives in the US, shipping some of their belongings over in a container, while taking a \u201cfew necessary things to make our lives a little more comfortable.\u201d In October 2020, they left the US for Thailand \u2013 the couple were given special visas due to the travel restrictions in place at the time. After undergoing a mandatory quarantine period, the Dolans briefly stayed with one of Som Dolan\u2019s relatives in Bangkok, before renting a home to live in while their house was being built. According to Jim Dolan, one of the biggest challenges of the relocation was the process of transporting their beloved pugs Morgan and Gwennie. \u201cThe dogs are difficult to move because they have a very short snout, and that makes their breathing suspect to respiratory problems and some carriers won\u2019t deliver them,\u201d he explains. \u201cSo it took a lot for us to get the two dogs here.\u201d The couple says they found the process of building their three-bedroom home, which they designed themselves, particularly tough, stressing that achieving the result that they desired meant a lot of back and forth with builders and contractors. \u201cIn the last four months of the building period, we had to come to visit the site every single day, to make sure that all the details would be the way that we wanted,\u201d says Som Dolan. The entire process took about a year and a half and cost around $300,000 \u201cincluding fence, fill and landscaping.\u201d \u201cIt turned out to be just what we wanted, and what we had hoped for,\u201d says Jim Dolan. \u201cIt was hard getting here. But the end result is what we wanted, and we\u2019re happy with it.\u201d He goes on to state that Thailand has proven to be more affordable for them, stressing that he and his wife feel \u201cfinancially comfortable\u201d now. \u201cI joined a golf club for about $1,100 to play as many rounds as I want to for a year,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I could do that in the United States.\u201d He also feels that their overall quality of life has improved immensely as a result of being based in Thailand. \u201cIt\u2019s very natural,\u201d says Jim Dolan. \u201cWe eat locally grown vegetables that are plentiful and really cheap. The food is great.\u201d When it comes to healthcare, he\u2019s opted to pay for private medical insurance in Thailand, and finds that it provides \u201cbetter benefits than my Medicare would in the United States and for much, much cheaper.\u201d \u201cThere are a lot of things that the average person might expect to be able to do in their retirement that are available here,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s a different culture. But it\u2019s not a different planet\u2026 You adapt. You learn and you experience. It\u2019s good.\u201d More than four years since their big move, the couple is now very settled in Sam Roi Yot, known for the Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, and love living there. Happy retirement \u201cIt\u2019s very quiet. Very peaceful. Very safe,\u201d says Jim Dolan. \u201cI feel safer here in Thailand than I think in any of the cities that I lived in the United States. \u201cI lived in Denver, Houston and Austin. And all of them have much, much higher rates of crime.\u201d While he and his wife are grateful to be able to live a very comfortable lifestyle in Thailand, Jim Dolan acknowledges that many Thai people \u201clive on a very, very, very small budget\u201d and \u201cservices and taxes are much lower\u201d as a result. He explains that pumps need to be incorporated into the build for certain new homes, as water pressure is \u201cminimal\u201d in the country, and the roads are \u201ca little bit rougher.\u201d \u201cThere are many of those little kinds of issues\u2026\u201d he says. \u201cThe infrastructure, I think, in the United States is more sophisticated, and perhaps more reliable. \u201cBut you pay for it. Your taxes are high. We don\u2019t pay any property taxes here. Our tax burden is virtually zero. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we could have built a brand new, three-bedroom, 3,000-square-foot house, within a mile of the ocean in the United States, on what we did here.\u201d Although he speaks other languages, including Spanish, Jim Dolan has struggled to learn Thai, pointing out that it\u2019s challenging \u201cfor the Western ear because it\u2019s a tonal language.\u201d \u201cThai language is a very, very difficult language to learn,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd I must admit, I haven\u2019t really tried very hard because I have a built-in translator in my family.\u201d And while Som Dolan is thrilled to be living in her native country once again, she says that going from speaking English constantly for a decade to using both Thai and English regularly has been confusing. \u201cI still have to speak English all the time. All day, every day,\u201d she says, pointing out that the majority of her husband\u2019s friends aren\u2019t Thai nationals, and she often finds herself acting as an interpreter. Although Jim Dolan admits that things haven\u2019t always been \u201csmooth sailing,\u201d he\u2019s confident that relocating to Thailand was the right choice for him and his wife. \u201cI think she had a bigger challenge moving to the United States than I had coming here,\u201d he says. He\u2019d advise anyone thinking of making a similar move to visit the country they\u2019re hoping to relocate to first, and avoid the temptation to \u201cup and buy a property on some remote place, halfway around the world, sight unseen.\u201d \u201cWe had traveled to Thailand a number of times and knew the area, knew what we were getting into,\u201d he adds. The Dolans haven\u2019t been back to the US since moving to Thailand, but eventually plan to return for regular trips. Jim Dolan is going to visit his family soon, but his wife has decided to stay behind to look after their dog Gwennie, who is nearly 15 years old\u00a0\u2013 Morgan passed away in 2022. \u201cNo one else would take care of her the way Som takes care of her,\u201d he says. \u201cSo as long as Gwennie is still with us. I\u2019ll be traveling back to the United States solo.\u201d Although he has no regrets about their move, Jim Dolan admits that there are some things that he misses about living in the US. \u201cI miss northeast seafood,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I miss my siblings. They\u2019ve lived on the East Coast for much of my life. \u201cAll of my family members were just a drive away (before) and now it\u2019s a big trip to visit. So that\u2019s a bit of a sacrifice. \u201cBut overall, I think we\u2019re much better off here than we would have been in the United States had we stayed there.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/us-couple-moved-to-thailand-built-home/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "2024_07_23_travel_school-field-trip-date-with-destiny", "text": "Six little words \u2013 mundane to anyone else \u2013 electrified me: Boxed Lunch on the Capitol Steps. It was one line from an itinerary of an upcoming field trip to Columbia, the capital of South Carolina. I couldn\u2019t have been any more excited if I had been told we were headed to New York City or London. The trip arranged by our teachers was a week or so away, and I pored over the schedule multiple times a day. Every line and every stop set my hyperactive sixth-grade mind afire, but none more than the boxed lunch entry. Questions and thoughts raced through my head: What\u2019s a \u201cboxed\u201d lunch? What would be in it? Will it be enough food? Why are we eating on the Capitol steps? How weird! How exciting! Who does stuff like that? Well, my class would! This was around 1974, and I had made the hour-long drive with my parents from my small hometown of about 5,000 souls to big-city Columbia a handful of times by then. My father had taken me to a few University of South Carolina football and basketball games, and my mother had taken me shopping for clothes at the likes of Belk and Kmart. The latter was a mix of drudgery and delight; the former much more solid fun. Both, however, were under firm parental control. But this trip was different. We\u2019d be seeing adult things. Important things. Things with times and agendas. I\u2019d be in the center of the action. Grown-up action. It turned out that each stop \u2013 from a historic home tour to a planetarium \u2013 would influence and inform the rest of my life. And no place proved more prescient than those Capitol steps. Off to Columbia \u2013 and the past! Some parts of that short trip have eluded my memory. For instance, I can\u2019t recall for sure if we took a school bus or went caravan-style in a makeshift fleet of station wagons. I think the cars, but I can\u2019t take that to the bank. I also don\u2019t recall any incidents with my classmates. That\u2019s actually significant because I was that kid. You know, the oddball who was more comfortable around teachers and other adults than his classmates. But other parts of the trip \u2013 what we did and where we did it and how it affected me \u2013 remain crystal clear. Our first stop of the day was the Robert Mills House and Gardens. I already had an interest in history, but I had thought nothing about architecture. That was about to change. The rounded arches of the first floor and the columns on the second floor of the brick mansion fascinated me. And when they told us Mills also designed the Washington Monument, I was 100% sold. The visit boosted my interest in history, especially in touring historic sites, and sparked a lifelong,\u00a0 albeit amateurish, interest in architecture that\u2019s even made its way into my work for CNN Travel. A life-changing boxed lunch South Carolina\u2019s Capitol, popularly called the State House, was just blocks away and was our next stop. Today, the building sports a brownish-gold copper dome, but back in the mid-1970s, the exterior dome was green-tinged before a massive renovation. We took a tour of the amazing State House interior and from a perch in the balcony, we got to see legislators in action. (Again, memory fails if we were watching the House or the Senate). I had no idea what the lawmakers were doing that day, but I was certain it was vitally important. Probably the biggest day in legislative history! Up in the balcony, someone spotted one of my classmate\u2019s older brothers on the floor. He was serving as a page, and I felt a jolt. If he could be a page, maybe I could as well one day. Then it was time to embark on my recent obsession \u2013 it was time for the boxed lunch! The boxes were passed out, and there we were. Eating on the Capitol steps, as outlined and promised on paper. I have no memory what was inside those white cardboard boxes. Probably a sandwich, chips and a cookie, the usual items in one. I have no memory who I sat by. Probably on the outer edges of the group, where I was a less likely target of teasing. But to my dying day, I\u2019ll remember what I thought and how I felt. I had a profound feeling of inner calm. For in that moment, sitting on those steps, looking out over the grounds and the buildings lining downtown Columbia, I realized my future. I had seen only an old house and the inside of a legislature so far, but it was already enough. In just half a day, I knew in a confident, quiet way that this was my place. What I felt didn\u2019t feel like a hopeful prediction or even a longing. Deep in my heart, I was certain that one day I\u2019d be living in Columbia as a college student. As a Gamecock. Studying journalism. I\u2019d again be at this spot, in this city, in the center of the action. And that I\u2019d be ready for it. I had no doubt or hesitation \u2013 this would surely come to pass. As a kid riddled by doubts and disharmony, I don\u2019t think I had ever been more sure or more happy. The cosmos and crime The afternoon stops solidified the revelation I felt on the State House steps. Our next place to visit was the now-closed Gibbes Planetarium, just a short walk away from the State House and the USC campus. If the Mills House represented an interesting past, Gibbes represented an intriguing future. I already enjoyed space-related matters both real (the recent Apollo missions) and imaginary (\u201cStar Trek\u201d reruns). But the Gibbes experience took my otherworldly fascinations to the next level. The night sky program and all the exhibits were yet another escape hatch. While I was already dead-set at this age at being a newspaper reporter, I was getting back-up ideas and interests in mind \u2013 historian or astronomer. In one day, life was quickly becoming endless possibilities. Our next stop appealed to the crime show fan in me \u2013 a tour of the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division. Popularly known in the state by its acronym SLED, you might have seen the agency mentioned in coverage of the Alex Murdaugh case. While I didn\u2019t leave the tour of their facilities with back-up plans of being a detective, it was interesting to get a behind-the-scenes look. My main memories of the place are of microscopes in a crime lab, chemical smells \u2013 and a ridiculous rumor that a classmate had \u201cstolen some drugs\u201d while we were there. But I was on such a natural high that our last stop didn\u2019t bother me a bit as we pulled into a chain steakhouse (I think, but cannot swear, it was Western Sizzlin\u2019) for supper. Normally, situations like that back then would set me on edge. I was terrible at negotiating the intricacies of lunchroom politics. But I recall no such nerves this time. I had just been exposed to the exit ramp from small-town life. Plus, I already had gotten the taste for steak by that age. Win-win. From there, the memories of the day fade into nothingness. That\u2019s because nothing else mattered. I had already learned and experienced everything I needed to know. Back to the future Everything came to pass as I knew it would on that field trip. I applied to the University of South Carolina and was accepted. I signed up as a journalism major \u2013 over the objections of my parents \u2013 before my freshman year even started in 1980. I was even assigned a dorm on Main Street, which runs to the Capital complex on its north and south sides. Everything was coming together. I moved into my fifth-floor dorm room the first day they opened the building to students. Douglas was its name. It was an early \u201860s-style monstrosity and was one of six buildings accurately dubbed The Honeycombs because of their exteriors. The dorm was in rough shape \u2013 and perfect. Hardly anyone was there yet. I guess eager, nerdy freshmen came to campus on the first day. I didn\u2019t care. I had already waited six years for this moment. I wasn\u2019t going to wait another day. And I knew what I had to do. Within days of my arrival, I went across the street to an eatery called Stuffy\u2019s, bought a sub (a new kind of exotic sandwich to me) and proceeded to make the very short trek to the Capitol grounds. It was late afternoon. In August. In Columbia. You don\u2019t know a real summer until you experience that. But I liked hot, humid weather, particularly back then. Again, I can\u2019t remember exactly what I ordered beyond a sub. And it was in a bag, not a box. But I indulged in an oh-so-sweet victory lap and lunch on those Capitol steps to launch my new life. The life I knew all along I could make happen. And did. The steps would continue to play a role in my life. I\u2019d take a lunch there every so often to eat and think. I once saw a clogging performance there my freshman year. It was put on by members of the Presbyterian Student Center, and many of the students at that center would turn out soon enough to become lifelong friends. I\u2019d even stopped at the steps several times after I graduated to sit and remember my sixth-grade self. At CNN Travel, we often write about people traveling to other nations and continents and having epiphanies and experiences that start them on exotic new lives. I didn\u2019t have to go nearly that far. I didn\u2019t even spend the night. For me, it was a mere 60-mile, in-state field trip \u2013 culminating with a Boxed Lunch on the Capitol Steps \u2013 that proved to be my date with destiny.

It\u2019s the Singapore passport, and it\u2019s just been named the world\u2019s most powerful travel document in a quarterly ranking of the passports with the most international clout. For the past 19 years, the Henley Passport Index, created by London-based global citizenship and residence advisory firm Henley & Partners, has been tracking global freedoms in 227 countries and territories around the world, using exclusive data from the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The next passports to come close to Singapore\u2019s global swag are those of Japan, Germany, France, Italy and Spain, which jointly hold the No.2 spot and whose citizens can enjoy visa-free travel to 192 destinations. Then, at third place in the ranking, come South Korea, Sweden, Finland, Austria, Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, all of which have the privilege of seamless jaunts to 191 destinations. The UK, which in the bygone days of 2014 held the top spot jointly with the United States, is in fourth place (190 destinations), alongside New Zealand, Norway, Belgium, Denmark and Switzerland. Australia and Portugal share the No.5 spot (189 destinations) while the US has dropped down to eighth place, with visa-free access to a modest 186 destinations. The widening gap While Singapore\u2019s magic number of 195 is a record high for both Singapore and the ranking, down at the other end of the scale, new lows are also being hit. Afghanistan has long been ranked the world\u2019s weakest passport by the index, but now its citizens can only travel to 26 countries without a visa \u2013 the lowest score recorded in the index\u2019s history of nearly two decades. Christian Kaelin, chair of Henley & Partners, said in a statement, \u201cThe global average number of destinations travelers are able to access visa-free has nearly doubled from 58 in 2006 to 111 in 2024. However, the global mobility gap between those at the top and bottom of the index is now wider than it has ever been.\u201d Nearly five billion people will take to the skies this year, across 39 million flights, according to estimates by the IATA. However, the real cost of air travel has dropped by over a third in that time, says IATA director general Willie Walsh, with airlines\u2019 profit per passenger now averaging out at just over $6 per passenger, \u201cbarely enough for a single espresso in a typical hotel caf\u00e9.\u201d African mobility Africa\u2019s richest man, Nigerian-born Aliko Dangote, complained at the recent Africa CEO Forum in Kigali that he needed 35 visas to travel around the continent - way more than a European visitor. Exclusive new research published in Tuesday\u2019s Henley & Partner\u2019s report compares Schengen visa rejection rates for African applicants to those from other regions. The findings, by Mehari Taddele Maru, Adjunct Professor at the School of Transnational Governance at the European University Institute, and Johns Hopkins University in Italy, were that around 30% of African Schengen visa applicants were rejected, compared to around 10% worldwide. Said Maru, \u201cThe European visa system clearly demonstrates a pre-determined bias against African applicants who face a triple whammy: lower passport power, higher visa rejection rates, and consequently, limited economic mobility.\u201d Multiple indexes Henley & Partners\u2019 list is one of several indexes created by financial firms to rank global passports according to the access they provide to their citizens.

{"id": "travel_north-korea-summer-camp-intl-hnk", "text": "Even for locals, travel inside the isolated nation officially known as the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea is heavily restricted. But arranging a trip was much easier for Russian national Yuri Frolov, 25, who spent two weeks in the hermit kingdom as a high-school student in 2015 and 2016.\u00a0Yuri\u2019s fascination with North Korea began with a TV documentary that portrayed the country as besieged by capitalist neighbors. This curiosity led him to join a \u201cSolidarity with North Korea\u201d group on VKontakte, Russia\u2019s Facebook equivalent. Through this group, he found an opportunity to attend Songdowon International Children\u2019s Camp in Wonsan, on North Korea\u2019s east coast. About $500 covered all expenses for a 15-day trip. His parents consented, and he traveled alone from St. Petersburg to Vladivostok, joining other children and Communist Party officials on the journey. Earlier this year, 100 Russian nationals were the first tour group allowed to visit North Korea since the pandemic, a sign of Russia\u2019s increasing popularity as Pyongyang deepens ties with Moscow. Before the pandemic, the largest source of inbound tourists to North Korea wasn\u2019t Russia \u2013 it was China. Upon his arrival at Songdowon International Children\u2019s Camp in summer 2015, the camp staff greeted Frolov and his group warmly. The camp hosted children from various countries, including Laos, Nigeria, Tanzania and China. However, interactions with North Korean kids were limited to the final day, a deliberate move to prevent any exchange of real experiences. The camp offered typical summer activities like beach outings and sandcastle-building competitions but also included peculiar rituals. Campers were required to wake at 6 a.m. and clean statues of former North Korean leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, even though professionals already maintained the monuments. Having reported from North Korea 19 times, I find Frolov\u2019s experiences both relatable and eye-opening. The heavy emphasis on propaganda, the strict supervision, and the bizarre mix of freedom and control are aspects I\u2019ve encountered repeatedly. One of the more bizarre activities at the summer camp involved a computer game where players, as a hamster in a tank, had to destroy the White House. This game reminded me of an exchange I had with two North Korean campers playing a similar game. When I asked who they were shooting, they responded, \u201cOur sworn enemy, Americans.\u201d I then asked, \u201cWhat if I told you I\u2019m an American? Do you want to shoot me too?\u201d Without hesitation, they replied, \u201cYes.\u201d After reassuring the youngsters I was a \u201cgood American,\u201d they decided I should be allowed to live. And then they smiled and waved as we said goodbye. This is the paradox of North Korea. People were usually friendly and polite, even as they told me the United States should \u201cdrown in a sea of fire.\u201d Despite the heavy propaganda, Frolov remained skeptical. The strict schedule frustrated him, especially when he wasn\u2019t allowed to skip early-morning exercise despite being sick. The camp\u2019s food was another challenge, with Frolov saying he mostly subsisted on rice, potato wedges and bread, leading to an 11-pound weight loss over the 15 days. His craving for familiar food was so intense that upon returning home, he bought a feast from Burger King, though he couldn\u2019t finish it all. Frolov recounted a memorable incident in Pyongyang: \u201cThere was a girl, very young, wearing a dress styled like the American flag in the city center. Surprisingly, no one was angry with her, even though she was told not to wear it again. It was a bizarre moment in such a controlled environment.\u201d \u201cMany things seemed fake, especially the science and innovation buildings. They were not convincing, even for a kid,\u201d he reflected. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a totally awful experience. I was mostly just bored. Apart from the lack of internet, it felt like any basic Russian camp for children.\u201d Despite the unpleasant and tightly controlled environment, he opted to return to the camp the following year, partly due to the Communist Party\u2019s arrangements and what he describes as his aversion to confrontation. In hindsight, Frolov acknowledges the decision as foolish but appreciates the unique stories he can share about North Korea. His account offers a rare glimpse into the experiences of foreign children at a North Korean summer camp, highlighting the country\u2019s efforts to indoctrinate young minds through a mix of cultural exchange and propaganda. Yuri Frolov\u2019s story is a powerful reminder of the lengths to which North Korea will go to shape perceptions and cultivate loyalty. His experiences at Songdowon International Children\u2019s Camp highlight the regime\u2019s use of propaganda and control to influence young minds, a strategy I\u2019ve observed firsthand during my reporting trips. Despite the stark differences in our roles \u2013 him as a camper and me as a journalist \u2013 our experiences reveal the same underlying truth about North Korea\u2019s relentless pursuit of ideological control.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/north-korea-summer-camp-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_article_bear-encounters-prevent-attacks-wellness", "text": "You\u2019re out for a hike, reveling in glorious nature. Suddenly, you spot a bear. And the bear has spotted you, too. Would you know what to do next? Beth Pratt sure would. She was once on the Old Gardiner Road Trail in Yellowstone National Park, enjoying her run in wild nature. Her reverie came to an end when she came upon a grizzly bear eating flowers.  \u201cI stopped. It stood on its hind legs and looked at me. I knew that wasn\u2019t a threatening gesture,\u201d she told CNN Travel. \u201cI\u2019m not kidding, it waved its paw at me as if to say, \u2018just go on your way,\u2019 and went back to eating.\u201d \u201cAnd I walked slowly away and put some distance between us, and the encounter ended fine.\u201d When it comes to dealing with bears, Pratt does have a thing or two on almost all the rest of us, though. She is the California regional executive director for the National Wildlife Federation, a job she\u2019s had for more than 10 years. She worked in Yellowstone for several years \u2013 and once saw nine grizzlies in one day there.    Finally, she lives on the border of Yosemite National Park, and bears will pass through her yard, including this one seen in the footage above in late September 2021. You can hear the enthusiasm in Pratt\u2019s voice as she shares her bear bona fides and advice to make sure bear/human encounters are delightful, not dangerous. \u201cA wild bear is a beautiful sight to see. It\u2019s incredible to see them in the wild. I never had a bad experience with bears. What I try to get people to feel is respect, not fear, for bears. The animal usually wants to avoid the encounters.\u201d  Bears in the news   Bear attacks are rare, Pratt and US National Park Service websites point out, but they do happen:  \u2022 A disable veteran survived an attack from a mother grizzly at Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming in May 2024. \u201cIt was the most violent thing I have ever experienced.\u201d \u2022 A hunter suffered serious injuries in a grizzly bear attack in British Columbia in May 2024. \u2022 Bear attacks are on the increase in Japan. \u2022 A man lost part of his jaw in a grizzly bear attack in Montana in September 2023. \u2022 Two people died in a suspected grizzly bear attack in Canada\u2019s Banff National Park in late September 2023. \u2022 Two collegiate wrestlers were mauled by a grizzly bear near Cody, Wyoming, in October 2022; they had serious injuries but survived. They illustrate the point that rare doesn\u2019t equal never. Feasts for beasts  While it pays to be diligent at any time, autumn is a particularly good season to bone up on bear facts and safety when many bears are in a phase known as hyperphagia, Pratt said. \u201cIt\u2019s a period in the fall where bears are eating anything and everything to fatten up for hibernation.\u201d  She noted mountain lions are comparatively picky eaters. Not bears.   \u201cThey eat everything: Ants. Roadkill. Flowers. Nuts. And unfortunately, human food that\u2019s not secured. Our food is very attractive to them; it\u2019s easy calories.\u201d   Combine that with the fact that some national and state parks have become very popular and crowded, and you have a recipe for potential trouble. \u201cIf more people are using public lands and more people are in the mix, there\u2019s more potential for encounters and conflict. It does concern me a little bit,\u201d Pratt said. The key is being prepared \u2013 and that\u2019s where Pratt and others in the know come in. First rule of \u2018bear fight club\u2019: Don\u2019t fight The best strategy is to never get in harm\u2019s way by enticing or provoking a wild bear. Trying to give a bear food or approaching cute cubs are particularly terrible ways to start an encounter. That\u2019s just looking for trouble. The US National Park Service site points out each bear and each encounter is different, but there are general guidelines useful in most situations. First of all, keep your distance if you happen upon a bear. Don\u2019t approach it, and give it plenty of room to walk away from you. Yellowstone tells you to stay at least 100 yards (300 feet or 91 meters) away; Shenandoah National Park in Virginia suggests 200 feet (61 meters) for its black bears. You can run afoul of the law as well as the bears if you get too close and end up paying a fine.   Other tips: \u2022 Talk calmly to yourself in low tones to identify yourself as human. \u2022 Walk with a group (we\u2019re smellier and noisier in packs) and stay on designated trails. \u2022 If you have a small child or dog, pick it up. \u2022 Don\u2019t put yourself between cubs and their mother. \u2022  Avoid direct eye contact and move away slowly, sideways if possible. Pratt said don\u2019t be alarmed if a bear stands on its hind legs; it\u2019s not considered an aggressive move. Almost all encounters are peaceful, Pratt said. Many times, people never knew they were even close to a bear, as in this YouTube video that shows two people emerging from a basement oblivious to a nearby bear.  What if a bear starts coming at you anyway?  If a bear starts making assertive moves in your direction, you have important decisions to make \u2013 and fast. First thing is: Stand your ground with bears. With either grizzlies (a subspecies of brown bears) or black bears, \u201cplease don\u2019t run. Bears can outrun anybody,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cDon\u2019t climb a tree either. They can also climb trees better than you.\u201d  New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Division of Fish and Wildlife (where the black bear population is growing) also has some tips: \u2022 Make loud noises by yelling, banging pots and pans or using an airhorn to scare bears away. \u2022 Make yourself look as large as possible by waving your arms.  \u2022 If you\u2019re with other people, stay together. Pratt said you can usually intimidate or bluff your way out of sticky bear situations, depending on the bear species and the situation.  But what if a bear is about to attack? You\u2019re now in the rarest of situations \u2013 you\u2019ve attracted a bear\u2019s attention. It didn\u2019t move off. It\u2019s started coming at you aggressively and fast. You think you\u2019re about to be attacked. What\u2019s next? One very crucial thing is to make a quick ID of the kind of bear, because your strategy is going to be different depending on the type of bear.  If it\u2019s a black bear, the NPS and Pratt have a clear message: Do not run. Do not play dead. \u201cYou want to stand your ground with black bears. Look as intimidating as possible,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cThrow things not at it but near it. Make that black bear intimidated by you. Let it know you are a big person. Pick something up; yell at it. If it attacks, fight back \u2013 aim for the face.\u201d It\u2019s a different situation with grizzlies If you\u2019re dealing with a grizzly that won\u2019t back off and an attack is imminent, you\u2019re advised to do the opposite. You should play dead. \u201cAct as unthreatening as possible with a grizzly. Play dead with a grizzly if it starts to attack,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cTuck and cover. Get into a fetal position. Wrap your hands around your neck. Lay on your stomach. Once you do that, 99 percent of the time the grizzly will move on.\u201d  NPS elaborates: \u201cRemain still until the bear leaves the area. Fighting back usually increases the intensity of such attacks. However, if the attack persists, fight back vigorously.\u201d   Fighting back a grizzly bear is the last resort \u2013 \u201cyour Hail Mary pass\u201d as Pratt called it \u2013 when all other options are out. An exception to this rule: If you\u2019re camping in a tent and are attacked, that bear likely sees you as food. NPS and Pratt say this is a time to fight. How do you tell a black bear from a grizzly? First off, know your area and read up on the bears there. In North America, grizzlies have a much more limited range than black bears do. In the Lower 48, they are in Washington, Montana, Idaho and Wyoming. And then in Alaska, too. They also cover large parts of western Canada. Black bears have more territory. They can be found in as many as 40 US states, much of Canada and even parts of northern Mexico, the National Wildlife Federation says. So say you\u2019re in Quebec, the Appalachians, the Ozarks, California or even parts of Florida, that\u2019s going to be a black bear. But if you\u2019re in Yellowstone or Glacier National Park, for instance, that could be a black bear or a grizzly. That\u2019s when it\u2019s crucial to know how to make a quick visual ID. You can\u2019t go by the color of the fur. Black bears can be black, brown, cinnamon, blond, blue-gray or white, according to Bear.org.  One of the best ways to tell the difference, Pratt said, is to look for a hump at the shoulders. Grizzlies have them. Black bears don\u2019t. She also said the face shapes are different. \u201cBlack bear faces look a little more cuddly to me, a little rounder, with a straight nose. A grizzly bear face looks more like a wild predator and has a dished shape.\u201d This NPS webpage has more helpful ways to tell the differences. Fun facts: Eight bear species can be found all over the world \u2013 from tropical Sri Lanka to the frigid reaches of Russia, Norway and Canada. And European websites such as Bear Watching Slovenia give many of the same safety tips as North Americans get. Bear spray and weapons Some people like to carry bear spray and/or a weapon with them when venturing into bear country.  Pratt is an advocate of the former and says be sure to practice using it first before going into the wild. NPS has helpful tips on using spray to ward off bears. She\u2019s more cautious about bringing firearms with you, especially if you\u2019re inexperienced. \u201cTaking a grizzly out with one shot would be tough. You need to be very experienced with a gun to increase your chance of safety.\u201d A Brigham Young University study in 2008 found spray more effective than a firearm. And spray doesn\u2019t permanently harm a bear. Some people like to carry bear bells on their hikes, hoping the noise will ward off the animals. But the park service says that \u201cYelling, clapping and talking are more effective ways of alerting a bear to your presence.\u201d What campers need to know If you\u2019re out camping overnight, you have extra considerations to take. Kyle Patterson, management specialist and public affairs officer at Rocky Mountain National Park, emailed CNN Travel some ways to keep hungry bears away. Patterson advised using a food storage locker if provided in campgrounds and picnic areas. Also, \u201cavoid storing food and coolers in your vehicle. If you must, store food in airtight containers in the trunk or out of sight. Close vehicle windows completely.\u201d Other tips and cautions: \u2022 Don\u2019t store food in tents or pop-up campers in campgrounds or in vehicles at trailheads. \u2022 Don\u2019t leave food, coolers and dirty cookware unattended. Park rangers may confiscate them and cite you. \u2022 Get rid of garbage in bear-resistant dumpsters and trash cans. Human-fed bears usually end up as chronic problems and need to be removed, Patterson said. \u201cA fed bear is a dead bear.\u201d The ball is in our court Pratt emphasized it\u2019s up to humans to be responsible to these creatures. \u201cThe bears are just being bears. We are way more of a threat to them. Bear attacks are so rare. And fatalities are even rarer,\u201d she said. \u201cThe bears\u2019 lives are more at threat than ours in encounters. I want people to have magical, wonderful experiences in the wild. I want people to feel OK about having these encounters.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/article/bear-encounters-prevent-attacks-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "travel"}}

Scott Vuncannon, a 58-year-old real estate developer and farmer, called his wife and said he was going hiking and would be back around 4 p.m.  He packed his safety gear, including a pistol, bear spay and enough food and water to last a couple of days, just in case. He grew up traversing the Uwharrie Mountains in central North Carolina. Now he was taking on more formidable wilderness from his summer home in Highlands, a popular resort town. Still, he had decades of hiking experience. With a 2-year-old Australian shepherd-blue heeler mix named Boone at his side, he headed to the Ellicott Rock Trail around 11 a.m. Wednesday in late August 2018. Two hours later, he was five miles in. \u201cMy dog took off chasing a squirrel, and I stopped and took a sip of water,\u201d Vuncannon recalled to CNN Travel. \u201cI called my dog \u2026 and he came headed back over. And as soon as I took a step, I saw movement.\u201d With no warning, \u201cI saw a snake head come up and strike me in my left calf. \u2026 My natural reaction was to jump back, and I bent over and pulled up my pant leg to see if he actually penetrated my long pants.\u201d Vuncannon saw two bite marks about 2 inches apart. Boone went after the snake, and only then did Vuncannon hear rattling. He tied on a tourniquet below the knee and above the bite. \u201cAs soon as I stood up, I could actually taste the poison in the back of my throat.\u201d His vision got blurry, and he sweated a lot. \u201cI pulled my phone my out and called 911, and of course, it said no cell service.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s when my heart sank.\u201d With no phone service, no human companions and the venom spreading rapidly, how would he survive? How dangerous are rattlesnakes to us?   Vuncannon was in known rattlesnake country. Their range is extensive in the Americas \u2013 from southern Canada to central Argentina. The thickest concentration is in the US Southwest and northern Mexico, according to the National Wildlife Federation. The estimated 36 rattlesnake species are adaptable, living in forests, grasslands, swamps and deserts. They may take up residence where people live and work. But for their range, US deaths from rattlesnake bites and other venomous snakes are quite rare.  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates about 7,000 to 8,000 people are bitten by venomous snakes in the United States each year. About five of those people die.  \u201cThe number of deaths would be much higher if people did not seek medical care,\u201d the CDC says. World estimates for death by venomous snakebite are much higher \u2013 81,000 to 138,000 a year. The pit viper family   Rattlesnakes are \u201cpit vipers\u201d with heat-detecting pits on their heads.  Other US snakes in that family are copperheads and cottonmouths, also called water moccasins. These latter  two species are concentrated in the central and eastern United States, whereas multiple species of rattlesnakes range across the United States.  Most pit vipers typically deliver a \u201chemotoxic\u201d venom that attacks the circulation system, destroying blood vessels and causing tissue damage. The only other venomous snakes in the United States are coral snakes. Known for their bright bands of red, yellow and black, they are in a different snake family that\u2019s related to cobras. They deliver a neurotoxin that disrupts nerve transmission and can cause respiratory failure and paralysis.    You\u2019re scared? So is the rattlesnake  Rattlesnakes\u2019 reclusive nature is one reason why there aren\u2019t more incidents. The rattlesnake \u201cactually views us as a predator; we\u2019re a large animal that could eat him. And they\u2019re afraid of us,\u201d said Ted Clamp, who founded the Edisto Island Serpentarium in coastal South Carolina in 1999 with his late brother.  Rattlesnakes tend to stay hidden.  \u201cWhen we encounter a snake on the move, he\u2019s usually looking for food or looking for a mate or looking for shelter. Otherwise, he stays hidden because they\u2019re so vulnerable to all sorts of predators.\u201d  Kimberly Andrews, who has a doctorate in ecology from University of Georgia\u2019s Marine Extension and Georgia Sea Grant and manages its Coastal Ecology Lab, said rattlesnakes are \u201csit-and-wait predators.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve seen rattlesnakes sit in one place for over a week waiting on a meal.\u201d So when there\u2019s an encounter, people have generally encroached on their territory. Where rattlesnakes hide  Rattlesnakes \u201chunt shelter constantly. They hide under these logs. They hide in stump holes \u2013 under anything they can,\u201d Clamp said. They also like woodpiles, thick brush and spaces under boulders, experts say. Clamp cited a case of a 12-year-old South Carolina boy playing at a log pile who got bit by a canebreak (timber) rattlesnake. He lived but only after a six-week hospital stay. Rodents are much more likely to get into your house than snakes, Andrews said. If snakes do get into your house, it\u2019s most likely you have a rodent infestation. Andrews said rattlesnakes play a key role in balancing the environment. \u201cThey\u2019re mostly eating mice and rats. \u2026 They\u2019re out there doing free pest control,\u201d she said. How to avoid a bite  Clamp and Andrews shared advice on how not to be a statistic. \u201cAlways be careful where you put your hands and your feet,\u201d Clamp said. \u201cIf you have a woodpile, go out and get your wood for the night during the day when you can see,\u201d Andrews added. Wear thick gloves. \u201cIf you\u2019re reaching under your house, shine a light under there. Make sure the coast is clear,\u201d she said. Other tips: \u2022 Wear closed-toe shoes and long pants when venturing into rattlesnake-friendly terrain. \u2022 Go around a rattlesnake on a wilderness trail if possible.  \u2022 If you find a rattlesnake in your yard, call agencies such as your state\u2019s natural resources departments or US Fish & Wildlife or contact a biologist at a local college, Andrews said. Do not try to kill the rattlesnake because that\u2019s when most people get bit, she said. \u2022 If you must deal with a rattlesnake on your own, Andrews says you can use a long branch or pole to gently nudge the snake toward an escape route if you\u2019re at least six feet or more away.   Andrews said rattlesnakes are most active in spring and fall, but vigilance is important all year. They might venture out in winter on a warm day. What do you do if you hear that bone-chilling rattle? \u201cUsually if he\u2019s rattling, he\u2019s alarmed,\u201d Clamp said. \u201cIf you can tell where he is and see him, back away from him. Don\u2019t approach him.\u201d Just know rattling does not come before every bite, as in Vuncannon\u2019s case. In dire straits Vuncannon knew he had to get out. \u201cI slowly, methodically started walking up the mountain, a pretty steep climb.\u201d He had only gone about a quarter of a mile when he lost his balance. He started crawling. Vuncannon was throwing up about every 15 minutes. Then he started to go in and out of consciousness.  \u201cMy dog stayed with me the whole time. He never left my side. He would paw at me and lick me in the face to keep me awake.\u201d About two hours after being bit, he fired a shot from his pistol into the air to get attention. Nothing. Back in Highlands, his wife had a gnawing feeling something was amiss. She found his truck at the trailhead around 4:30, and returned to town for help. Around 5:30, a rescue attempt was finally underway. \u201cJust so happens around 5:30, I had pretty much given in that I wasn\u2019t going to make it out alive. So I went ahead and made a goodbye video to my family with my phone. I recorded about a three-minute video; I couldn\u2019t talk clearly because my throat was so swollen.\u201d It was getting dark, and Boone start to growl. Vuncannon saw a black blur moving his way and feared a bear was coming to finish the rattlesnake\u2019s job.  What to do if a rattlesnake bites you  \u201cIf you are bitten, you need to seek medical attention as quickly as possible,\u201d Clamp said. \u201cIf you know it\u2019s a really serious bite, you should probably call EMS to come get you.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll know if you have a serious bite in just a couple of minutes. \u2026 You can start to feel tingling in your face.\u201d According to the California Poison Control System, other symptoms could include: \u2022 Extreme pain and swelling at the bite\u2022 Lots of bleeding\u2022 Nausea, lightheadedness and drooling\u2022 Swelling in the mouth and throat And if you can\u2019t make that SOS call? \u201cKeep your heartbeat as low as possible. It takes a while for the venom to work. Don\u2019t run. [But] get yourself somewhere you can get a signal as soon as possible,\u201d Clamp said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to really help you from the venom except the serum.\u201d  The snakebite victim should stay as calm as possible and deep breathe, Andrews said. If someone can stay with the victim, that person should talk to them and keep them from falling asleep.  Take notes or voice record on a smartphone what happened, she said. If possible, use a marker or pen and circle where you were bitten in case of swelling. They\u2019ll need to know the bite point at the hospital. Remove jewelry such as rings and tight clothing before you start to swell, the Mayo Clinic says.  What not to do Andrews said don\u2019t employ the out-of-date Boy Scout advice of cut-and-suck (cutting an X at the bite area and sucking the venom out by mouth or suction cups). \u201cIt\u2019s very ineffective,\u201d she said, adding people are likely to do more damage from the knife cut than from the snake bite.  Don\u2019t try to kill the snake to bring to the hospital, Andrews said, and don\u2019t take a picture of it unless you can do so easily. \u201cDon\u2019t comprise your safety by forcing another interaction with an already defensive rattlesnake.\u201d   Clamp, Andrews and other experts say do not apply a tourniquet to a pit viper bite (which is something Vuncannon did). That venom is \u201cconcentrated, and it works like an acid. It breaks down blood vessels and multiple skin tissues,\u201d Clamp said. \u201cAnd if you confine that venom in that area, you\u2019re apt to lose a limb from that. If you allow it to spread, you\u2019re more apt to keep your hand or fingers.\u201d In updated advice, the Boy Scouts and other experts say don\u2019t apply ice or cold packs to the bite and don\u2019t use Advil, Motrin or other nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs. Clamp and Andrews said your response should be the same no matter which type of pit viper bites you. \u201cThe best emergency response to a snakebite is car keys and a cell phone,\u201d Andrews said. Vuncannon\u2019s rescue and recovery   Fortunately, that was not a bear Vuncannon saw but a rescuer\u2019s black lab. However, it was getting dark, and Vuncannon was getting worse.  A helicopter couldn\u2019t be used because of the thick canopy. Vuncannon was too far gone to be slowly carried out. So he was moved by motorcycle, strapped to a driver and held up by paramedics walking on either side. That took three hours.  More than 11 hours after he first got bit, he made it to Mission Hospital in Asheville, but he had already gone into cardiac arrest. Doctors had bad news for his family. Vuncannon had less than a 5% chance to survive. His rescue was one miracle, and he needed a second one. He got around a dozen antivenom treatments and other medical interventions. Vuncannon was in a coma for three days but pulled through. \u201cIt took me a total of about three months to fully recover enough to where I could actually walk and have the energy to get around.\u201d He later learned it was a timber rattlesnake that bit him and that it directly hit a vein, which made the venom spread more rapidly but later spared him from tissue damage.  What Vuncannon learned He\u2019s back on the trails, but he carries a satellite phone, especially on deeper trails. He\u2019s also more likely to find someone to hike with him. If he goes alone, it\u2019s on wider, well-maintained trails. \u201cAnd I also carry hiking poles with me to brush the side of the trail just in case. Let someone know exactly where you\u2019re going, when you\u2019ll be back.\u201d He now has three grandchildren. \u201cI look forward to teaching them about the wilderness and the outdoors and how to avoid snake bites and dangerous encounters.\u201d  Andrews applauds learning about snakes, so that you can keep your family safe and \u201cactually enjoy a venomous snake sighting, something that is comparatively rare and can be pretty special.\u201d Clamp pointed out pit vipers can be lifesavers, too. They\u2019re important to us \u201cbecause a tremendous amount of research has been done with different venoms,\u201d noting some FDA-approved, lifesaving drugs are derived from snake venom.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/article/how-to-survive-rattlesnake-bite/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_vietnam-specialty-salt-coffee-hue-ca-phe-muoi", "text": "It\u2019s become a popular beverage trend on social media platforms like TikTok in recent months \u2013 how to customize your Starbucks order so it tastes like a Vietnamese iced coffee. And increasingly, some posters are including tips on how to request a specialized version of this sweet caffeinated beverage those in the know swear by \u2013 salt coffee, or ca phe muoi. A small, no-frills caf\u00e9 in Vietnam\u2019s historical city of Hue is widely credited with inventing this now-popular beverage, which is made by adding sweetened condensed milk to a base of Vietnamese coffee. The mixture is topped with salted cream and it\u2019s served hot or iced. \u201cWe created salt coffee in 2010 when we opened our first Ca Phe Muoi coffee shop at 10 Nguyen Luong Bang Street,\u201d co-owners Ho Thi Thanh Huong and Tran Nguyen Huu Phong tell CNN Travel via email. \u201cThis combination of condensed milk, salt and black coffee (creates a) creamy mixture that softens the bitterness of the coffee and balances the sweetness of the condensed milk.\u201d The name of the cafe and now-famous drink is telling. \u201cCa phe\u201d means coffee and \u201cmuoi\u201d means salt in Vietnamese. \u201cWe hoped this name would attract people because they always think that black coffee is only with sugar or milk\u2026 we thought that if we wanted to open a coffee shop we had to make (it a little different to) attract the customers, then the salt coffee taste would keep them with us,\u201d says the couple. The strategy worked. Curious locals and tourists began to visit \u2013 and they liked what they were drinking. \u201cHue people had a habit of drinking black coffee with sugar or condensed milk, so salty coffee was (considered) a strange drink,\u201d they add. \u201cWe were really grateful to our first customers, they were willing to try this strange drink, and gave us feedback so we quickly perfected the flavors.\u201d Before long, salt coffee became known as a specialty drink representing historic Hue and cafes around Vietnam began serving it as well. \u201cAfter the Covid-years, salt coffee seems to be a trend across Vietnam,\u201d say the Ca Phe Muoi founders. \u201cIn Hue, salt coffee became a daily drink like black coffee or white coffee so this trend brings more change to our business.\u201d Today, the caf\u00e9 bottles its salt coffee to sell in other Vietnamese cities as well. Though the name might turn people off, the flavors really do work. The sweetened milk and cream balances the bitterness of the coffee, and salt heightens the sweetness \u2013 much like how a little bit of salt in salted caramel makes the caramel flavors more prominent. Even Starbucks\u2019 branches in Vietnam have joined the salt coffee wave, launching their own version of ca phe muoi in May this year. Vietnam isn\u2019t the only country that adds salt to its coffee. In 2023, a Bon Appetit article suggested we should all be adding it to our brews to cut some of the bitterness and heighten the flavors, noting the\u00a0tradition goes back hundreds of years\u00a0in countries like Turkey, Hungary and Siberia. Growing global interest in Vietnamese coffee Vietnam, which primarily grows\u00a0robusta beans, is the world\u2019s second-largest exporter of coffee after Brazil. The country\u2019s coffee exports have already hit $2.9 billion in the first five months of this year, marking a 43.9% increase over the same period last year, according to the International Trade Council. That salt coffee has become ubiquitous around cafes in Hue and a common option on menus across Vietnam nowadays shouldn\u2019t come as much of a surprise. First introduced by French colonists in the 1850s, coffee is extremely popular throughout the country. Coffee outlets range from hole-in-the-wall counters with plastic stools on the sidewalk, to sleek, contemporary cafes with roasters on the premises. (Read more about Vietnam\u2019s vibrant coffee culture here.) Traditional Vietnamese coffee is brewed in a phin \u2013 a metal, filtered brewing device \u2013 that\u2019s  placed over a cup or pot. Many people prefer to stir a tablespoon or two of sweetened condensed milk into the strong brew. And salt coffee is just one of several distinctive Vietnamese coffee drinks that might raise a few eyebrows among those who\u2019ve yet to sample them. Perhaps the most famous of them all is egg coffee, or ca phe trung. Invented in Hanoi, this dessert-like recipe adds a topping of egg yolks, frothed with condensed milk, to a coffee base. And then there\u2019s coconut coffee \u2013\u00a0ca phe cot dua \u2013 which features coffee blended with coconut milk and ice \u2013 a cold treat with a tropical kick. In fruit shake coffee\u00a0\u2013 sinh to ca phe \u2013 coffee is combined with banana or avocado to produce a smoothie. And finally, there\u2019s yogurt coffee\u00a0\u2013 sua chua ca phe\ufeff \u2013 which features black coffee drizzled onto creamy Vietnamese yogurt, another French legacy. According to a report by global market research agency Mintel released in 2023, consumers outside Asia are increasingly interested in these novel coffee experiences and flavors. Some 71% of Gen Z consumers interviewed by Mintel in the US said that they were interested in trying Asian-inspired coffee drinks such as Vietnamese coffee. In the US, 7 Leaves Caf\u00e9, a caf\u00e9 chain selling Vietnamese drinks, has expanded to more than 40 branches across the country after opening its first caf\u00e9 in California in 2011. Meanwhile, independent Vietnamese cafes have been popping up around the country, with Phin Ca Phe in Seattle and C\u00e0ph\u00ea Roasters in Philadelphia among those offering versions of salt coffee. Across the Atlantic in London, venues like Caphe House offer various Vietnamese coffee drinks including ca phe trung. Back in Hue, Huong and Phong say the majority of their patrons order salt coffee, though there are other items on the menu such as chanh xi muoi, a special house-made lemonade with salted lemon jam. And though they serve both iced and hot versions of salt coffee, they think the former is the tastiest option. The couple now has a second, bigger branch of Ca Phe Muoi just a stone\u2019s throw away from the palace and the moat of the ancient Hue Imperial City. \u201cWe feel joy and a little pride because we made a drink that is loved by many people and it is even considered a Hue specialty,\u201d they say.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/vietnam-specialty-salt-coffee-hue-ca-phe-muoi/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "travel"}}

{"id": "travel_little-britain-inn-germany-gary-blackburn", "text": "Rolling hills, thick forests and the Rhine River whirling through it all \u2013 the region of Rheinland-Pfalz, or Rhineland-Palatinate, is textbook Germany. Nearby Bonn was the capital of West Germany from 1949 to 1990, and before that, the Romantic movement descended on the castles and wooded landscapes of the region. For many, this is Deutschland at its finest. And yet one corner of it is not German at all. In the quiet village of Vettelschloss, half an hour south of Cologne, is a patch of land that, to all accounts and purposes belongs to Germany\u2019s old rival: England. \u201cWelcome to Little Britain,\u201d says a banner slung between two houses \u2013 a banner draped in the colors of the Union Jack, the UK flag. The entrance is guarded by two huge statues of lions (like the ones in Trafalgar Square), grenadier guards and a line-up of classic British cars. If that\u2019s not enough, there\u2019s also a life-size resin figure of the late Queen Elizabeth sitting on a bench beside the door, observing the comings and goings. Oh, and Prince William stands grinning behind a bench, next to those grenadier guards. Welcome to the Little Britain Inn, a corner of Germany that shall remain forever England. Step inside to a traditional British pub, where portraits of \u201cPeaky Blinders\u201d actors and lifesize Paddington Bears are your neighbors. Through the doorway is the restaurant, frescoed with medieval-style images of Robin Hood and his merry men. Upstairs, and across two buildings are the bedrooms \u2013 each themed with something British, from James Bond to her late majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, frescoed on the wall. While outside, in a space open to all, is a magical mystery tour of all things British. There are two double decker buses and lifesize statues of characters from film, TV and literature, from Mr. Bean and Jack Sparrow to Alice in Wonderland and Shaun the Sheep. Benches have plaques dedicating them to parts of the UK. Lifesize British bobbies (policemen) stand to attention beside a red carpet leading past the queen. Actually, make that queens \u2013 because there are two Elizabeths, one for each building. Wooden huts \u2013 which host the annual Christmas market and other special events \u2013 are bedecked with larger-than-life images of the royals: Kate and William, Meghan and Harry, Charles and Camilla, and the late queen with Paddington Bear, all superimposed on classic British landscapes. Oh, and there\u2019s a shrine to Princess Diana in a quieter part of the garden. Every year, members of a German fan club of the late princess gather here to pay their respects. Because that\u2019s the thing about the Little Britain Inn. Its biggest fans are German. This little patch of land in Vettelschloss has become a place where age-old rivals meet and remember what they like about each other. It sounds like a heartwarming tale of two cultures coming together \u2013 but it hasn\u2019t all been plain sailing. In fact, the reason the Little Britain Inn exists is because of a cross-cultural argument. A space to combat Brexit The Inn is the idea of Gary Blackburn, a Brit who moved to Germany in 1985, aged 21, with 50 marks (around $27) in his pocket, a small bag of clothes, and the dream of staying a few months, working as a tree surgeon. Nearly four decades later, Blackburn is still there. His tree surgery practice takes him all over Germany. He has brought up six children in the country and married twice: first to a German woman, and, for the past 22 years, to Monika, who\u2019s originally from Poland. Yet despite his cosmopolitan lifestyle, Blackburn always hankered after his homeland. Hence the collection of UK-themed memorabilia that he started in 2016 when he bought an old UK phone booth. It was in the wake of the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, and Blackburn was partly paying homage to his roots, but also wanting to do his bit to rebuild relations between the UK and the EU. \u201cI could see things were going to change, and people were asking what I thought about Brexit. So I started collecting things. The idea was to make a place where the Brits and the Germans could keep their friendship going,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone loved the queen, Germans still talk about her all the time. So I wanted to keep the German-British friendship, rather than have them turn against us for doing Brexit.\u201d The phone box was just the start. Then came the (first) lifesize model of the queen. Then came more. And more. Two double decker London buses \u2013 one of which is from 1966, the year that England infamously beat Germany in the World Cup soccer final \u2013 became the centerpiece of what he modestly calls \u201ca bit of a collection.\u201d In total, he actually has four buses, two of which are currently under restoration. \u201cI went a bit crazy,\u201d he admits. Initially Blackburn stored it all at his home, on the outskirts of the village. Germans visiting the Rhine area would pop by for a gawp, a photo and a chat. But in 2018 he hit a bump in the road. His newest purchase was a tank, and his neighbors  decided to object to the whole installation. The local authorities agreed. They missed the point, says Blackburn; the tank wasn\u2019t a declaration of war. For starters, it\u2019s a post-war model, he\u2019s keen to point out. \u201cIt\u2019s a monument for freedom and peace \u2013 that people shouldn\u2019t forget how horrible wars are,\u201d he says. The footpath running beside his house leads to land that was the scene of heavy fighting during World War II. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any bad intention. I wanted people to think, not hide things under the carpet.\u201d He certainly did make them think. When he was ordered to shut down his exhibition, it made worldwide headlines \u2013 and he received waves of support from Germans who\u2019d enjoyed seeing his homage to the UK when they came biking and hiking along the Rhine. They thought it was all over\u2026. But they didn\u2019t bargain on Blackburn having a cunning plan. A hotel to house his memorabilia Vettelschloss sits across the boundary of two local authorities. While the one in which Blackburn\u2019s home was situated \u2013 Erpel, in the district of Unkel \u2013 asked him to shutter the site, authorities on the other side of the village \u2013 Vettelschloss itself, under the jurisdiction of Linz \u2013 were making more hospitable noises. Blackburn estimates that he has spent over 500,000 euros ($535,000) on his collection. As well as the buses (one alone was 55,000 euros plus tax), he has a collection of cars including a Rolls-Royce, London taxis, a Mini, phone boxes, postboxes, multiple figures and even a Tardis from \u201cDoctor Who.\u201d \u201cI could have retired but this has been more fun, living my dreams and using my imagination,\u201d he says. Monika calls his collection \u201ccrazy.\u201d \u201cHe goes over the top \u2013 he doesn\u2019t buy just one thing, he buys four or five,\u201d she shrugs. So what do you do when your collection of UK memorabilia worth half a million dollars is shuttered by one half of the village? You move it to the other. In 2020, Blackburn saw a house on the Vettelschloss side of the boundary for sale for 350,000 euros ($375,000) and promptly snapped it up. \u201cI bought it to park the tank and the buses,\u201d he says, simply. But then he had a lightbulb moment. Instead of simply recreating the open-air exhibition space they\u2019d had before, they could open a hotel themed around the UK. Who opens a hotel during a pandemic? A man convinced that Germans will love memorabilia of the British royal family. He was right. The Little Britain Inn opened in September 2020, and was immediately so popular that the following year Blackburn bought the house next door to add more rooms, a restaurant and a pub. Today, the hotel caters to the hikers and cyclists who come for the Rhine Valley, as well as those who, according to Blackburn, come to Vettelschloss purely for the Little Britain Inn. Blackburn\u2019s collection \u2013 including the infamous tank, now painted in the colors of the Union Jack \u2013 is scattered around the two houses and the garden area between them. \u201cGermans love it \u2013 more Germans like England than you can imagine,\u201d he says, noting that their 9.3 rating on Booking.com is higher than that of the hotel nearby where the actual queen of England once stayed. The Little Britain Inn also rates 4.8 out of 5 on Google. \u201cLots of people come for a weekend, as a present,\u201d he says. \u201cThe food\u2019s really good. The sheets are Egyptian cotton, brought over from England. The towels are from Guildford (in the UK) \u2013 we spent 40,000 euros on bedding alone. Some of our best guests have been here eight or 10 times \u2013 it\u2019s like they\u2019re our friends.\u201d Today, the Little Britain Inn is going from strength to strength. Its last Christmas fair \u2013 where they sold traditional Cornish pasties, fish and chips, and beer galore, while a DJ and an Elvis impersonator provided the entertainment \u2013 was bigger than the one in the nearby town of Linz, says Blackburn. For the coronation last year, they put on a party, with guests arriving in Charles and Camilla masks. When Queen Elizabeth died, they stuck to a sober screening of the funeral. Rooms fit for a queen Hotel guests can pick one of the 12 rooms themed by place (like Cornwall, which has a mural of a clifftop scene painted behind the bed) or by person, whether real or fictional \u2013 including James Bond, Mr. Bean, Agatha Christie, Harry Potter and the late queen. All have themed murals behind the bed, in which no attention to detail has been spared \u2013 Blackburn says that when he noticed that some flowers in the Cornish room didn\u2019t look like the flowers that grow on Cornish clifftops, he got the artist back in to change them. Awakening in the morning, guests traipse down past the buses, tank and statues, to a full English breakfast of sausages, bacon, baked beans, toast and more. Everything is top quality \u2013 in fact, says Blackburn, everything is sourced from the UK, apart from the eggs. The tea, the beer, everything is shipped over from the UK \u2013 no wonder some Germans pop in for breakfast alone. They also have gin especially blended from them \u2013 the King Charles one is infused with honey, while the top-of-the-range bottle is called Lillibet (the late queen\u2019s nickname). Morning coffee and tea is served in mugs by chi-chi designer Emma Bridgewater with names of the royals painted on them. Those popping in during the day can try fish and chips, roast dinners, cream teas and more, all made by Monika, who had never attempted British food before opening the inn, and says she learned to make the cooked breakfasts and fish and chips by watching YouTube and Instagram videos. Meals are taken either in the medieval-themed dining room (the Robin Hood murals are recreations of the illustrations of a childhood book Blackburn\u2019s grandmother gave him), in the beer garden, or out the front, on a bench beside the queen or chairs underneath Prince William. Regulars have donated bits and pieces to the collection, from pictures of the royals to books, Harry Potter memorabilia and even a piano. About half his clients are German, he says \u2013 and regulars include local politicians, including the mayor of Vettelschloss. \u201cHe comes here, we drink beer, it\u2019s all fine,\u201d says Blackburn. \u201cThey\u2019re nice people.\u201d The other half are mainly made up of migrants and visitors from English-speaking countries, he says. Then there are others visiting the area for work or pleasure. People coming on business to Birkenstock and John Deere, which have factories nearby, stay at the Inn. On the night CNN was in the building, there were visitors from Argentina. Because despite the kitsch, the rooms are incredibly comfortable. Monika and the couple\u2019s daughters Emily and Alyson run the inn together. Emily, 20, is off to hotel school next to learn how to take things up a notch. Blackburn hopes that when he and Monika retire, the girls can take over the business. Cross-cultural contamination But for Blackburn, the Little Britain Inn isn\u2019t a hotel; it\u2019s a state of mind. And one the Germans share. \u201cThe Germans really respect the royals, and felt closer to the UK than anywhere else in the EU,\u201d he says. Blackburn says he hopes to retire back in the UK one day. He is, after all a fervent royalist. Monika is less so but says, diplomatically, \u201cI think England without the kings and queens wouldn\u2019t be the same.\u201d She generously let her husband name their dogs: Charles and Camilla, a red setter-Australian setter mix and a Altdeutsche Sch\u00e4ferhund (a breed known as an \u201cold German shepherd\u201d), who recently had puppies together. They\u2019re not the only ones with royal names in the family: Alyson\u2019s middle name is Diana, and one of Monika and Gary\u2019s sons is called William. The real Charles, Camilla and William may be around 330 miles northwest, but Blackburn lives in hope that one day he might get a royal knock on the door. \u201cI think they\u2019d really appreciate it \u2013 especially because they\u2019re part German,\u201d he says, opening the door of the gents toilets to reveal King Charles plastered over the toilet door, overlooking the urinals. Perhaps a state visit could be on the cards.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/little-britain-inn-germany-gary-blackburn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_china-emperors-food-beijing-forbidden-city-intl-hnk", "text": "The Forbidden City was once one of the most powerful places on the planet. In 1420, while Europe was in the midst of the Hundred Years\u2019 War and yet to discover America, China\u2019s Ming Dynasty ruler was moving into his new home in the center of Beijing and beginning to strengthen his grip on an expanding empire. Inside their vast palace, China\u2019s emperors were unassailable, protected not just by the miles of walls surrounding them, but by the extreme secrecy that governed the lives of the royalty within them. It was called the \u2018Forbidden City\u2019 because few Chinese subjects were allowed to enter. The last emperor was evicted in 1924. In the years that followed, as the world\u2019s largest palace complex began to open its doors to the outside world, the enigmas of even the darkest corners of the Forbidden City were exposed to daylight. But one topic remains murky, even today: Food. Decades after the fall of imperial China, even as historians continue to collaborate to examine China\u2019s past, very little is known about what was eaten in one the world\u2019s richest and most powerful households \u2013 especially in the early days, as most of the ancient documents that might offer insights into the topic have been sealed off because of their fragile state. Zhao Rongguang, a food historian from the northern Chinese province of Heilongjiang, is one of the last few people \u2013 and quite possibly the only person \u2013 to have accessed and thoroughly studied all of them before they were locked away. This puts him in the rare position of being able to debunk many of the myths about palace cuisine that have persisted for decades. Zhao began delving into the Forbidden City\u2019s culinary mysteries more than four decades ago. Beijing back in the 1980s was still a city of bicycles and backstreets \u2013 a far cry from the metropolis of skyscrapers and highways it is today. But it was also an exciting decade, as the country re-opened to the world \u2013 and Western culture \u2013 after leader Deng Xiaoping announced his \u201copen door policy\u201d in late 1978. It was the decade when Wham! became the first Western pop band to perform in China since 1949, and Paris\u2019 iconic Maxim\u2019s restaurant opened an outpost in Beijing. Zhao, now 76, wasn\u2019t distracted by these new trends. He had saved up money from his teaching job to travel to Beijing to pursue his mission to find out what China\u2019s ancient emperors and their families really ate. It wasn\u2019t an easy task. In his path were two main obstacles. Firstly, the enduring secrecies of the palace \u2013 so little had been revealed to those outside its towering red walls during the five centuries it was occupied. Secondly, he says, food wasn\u2019t considered a serious topic worthy of study in China, meaning documents focusing on what was eaten during the early days of palace life were scattered and scarce. Zhao persisted, returning summer after summer to what was then called the First Historical Archives of China, in the old palace\u2019s Xihuamen, or West Prosperity Gate, where he pored over centuries-old imperial documents, which he believes were locked away in the 1990s. Slowly, he began to build up a picture of how dining in the Forbidden City evolved, zeroing in on three historical figures who were key to shaping royal eating habits. And now, nearly 40 years after he began his research, he has a pretty good idea. It all starts, Zhao tells CNN, with Kangxi, an emperor of the Manchu-led Qing Dynasty that seized full control of China after 1644\u00a0when the Ming imperial family, aligned with China\u2019s majority Han ethnic group, was ousted. Under his rule, between 1661 and 1722, the country entered into a relatively peaceful era following decades of dynastic fighting \u2013 and that led to some interesting menu changes inside the Forbidden City. At first, after the Qing Dynasty initially moved in, traditional foods from the nomadic Manchu heartlands of northeastern China were on the table, according to documents from the era studied by Zhao. In the mid-Kangxi reign, royal diets began to evolve. \u201cThere was still a lot of roast game and unusual foods on Kangxi\u2019s table, like tiger testicles,\u201d says Zhao. Tiger testicles? \u201cYes, you heard me right, tiger testicles. Ancient people thought that they had a libido-boosting effect. I believe Kangxi had eaten plenty of them as it was recorded officially that Kangxi had hunted more than 60 tigers in his life.\u201d Rooster combs were another ingredient eaten as an aphrodisiac, says Zhao. But eventually, as society stabilized further during Kangxi\u2019s rule, more ethnic Han dishes began to appear in the mix of palace offerings, like duck gizzard stew. The Forbidden City\u2019s golden influencer The opaque world of Forbidden City dining gets a little clearer when we skip forward to Kangxi\u2019s grandson, an imposing figure known as Qianlong Emperor. During his nearly 61 years on the throne (1735-1796) \u2013 a time Zhao considers the second important phase of the Forbidden City\u2019s culinary evolution \u2013 Qianlong had his daily menus meticulously recorded, a paper trail that means historians can now reconstruct a more accurate view of the lifestyle in the palace at that time. Inside the Hong Kong Palace Museum, for instance, an ongoing exhibition titled \u201cFrom dawn to dusk: Life in the Forbidden City\u201d is heavily based on Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily rituals \u2013 meals included. \u201cSo what is the Forbidden City? It\u2019s a city. It is an institution. Just like any community, food culture was an indispensable part of the entire culture inside the Forbidden City,\u201d says Daisy Yiyou Wang, deputy director of the Hong Kong Palace Museum, a sister museum of Beijing\u2019s Palace Museum at the Forbidden City. \u201cThe food culture itself reflects so much of the identity of the people. Their status and power and authority, and their taste, and relationships as well.\u201d Among the exhibition\u2019s displays is a bulky silver milk teapot that dates to the 18th or 19th century, sitting between a gleaming gold wine ewer with cloud and dragon reliefs and a glass bowl bearing exquisite gold threads. The elaborately painted teapot, with its gilded golden dragons, suggests that milk tea, a Manchu meal staple, was an essential part of the royal court\u2019s diet during the Qing Dynasty. \u201cTea bricks would be broken into boiling water. Milk, butter and a pinch of salt were added. They then filtered the tea leaves out and then served the tea in this type of silver teapot,\u201d says Nicole Chiang, the Hong Kong Palace Museum\u2019s art historian and curator. The salted milk tea reflects the royal court\u2019s Manchurian roots. \u201cEven when Qianlong traveled to the Jiangnan region (south of the Yangtze River where modern-day Hangzhou and Shanghai are), he hired a milk tea master from Mongolia to prepare milk tea for the court every day.\u201d Chiang, who says she enjoys studying the Qing Dynasty due to the sheer number of historical artifacts preserved from that era, from texts to paintings, says the court also dined on hot pot - the traditional Chinese dish in which ingredients are cooked in a simmering bowl of soup stock right on the table. \u201cOne of the palace maids said that (the royal family) would have a hot pot dish almost every day for three months during wintertime. It was a popular dish,\u201d says the historian, pointing to an enamel hot pot from the Forbidden City on display at the Hong Kong Palace Museum. Chiang, currently preparing for a future exhibition on food and travel in the Forbidden City, notes that though Emperor Qianlong had his menus recorded, it\u2019s still challenging to study palace food history as most of the sealed-off documents have\u00a0not\u00a0been released to researchers and the public. (Her own exhibition is based on documents that have already been published by the Palace Museum.) As one of the few who have ever laid eyes on the archived documents, Zhao has had some of his research published in the last few decades. He continues to work and says he is now compiling a book based on all of his findings, which will further demystify the topic of palace cuisine. Through this wealth of knowledge, Zhao has been able to view the long-held beliefs about what was eaten inside the Forbidden City through a wider lens and add some much-needed context. And that includes the emperor\u2019s supposed love for hot pot. \u201cMenus were often presented to the emperor the night before for approval,\u201d he says. \u201cThey reflected the personal tastes of the emperor \u2013 but were not solely based on his preferences. So we know Qianlong Emperor had hot pots \u2013 which were mostly written as \u2018warm pots\u2019 in the records. It could be because of the weather and tradition but it might not mean Qianlong loved them.\u201d He says that in Qianlong Emperor\u2019s time, imperial cuisine was much more refined and diverse \u2013 with both traditional Manchu dishes like roasted Asian roe deers and pheasants \u2013 as well as southern dishes, especially from the Jiangnan region. \u201cThe game on his menus showcases his northern roots,\u201d says Zhao. \u201cOne of the dishes that appeared very often in his record was the Sika deer tail platter. The tail was quite a small part \u2013\u00a0but a wonderfully fat and fragrant part of a deer.\u201d Smoked red-braised duck, fried spring bamboo shoots with pork and bird\u2019s nest soup with rock sugar were some of the other regulars from the Jiangnan region that were frequently eaten in the Forbidden City. Qianlong Emperor, alongside other Qing Dynasty nobility, believed that bird\u2019s nest soup \u2013 made with the solidified saliva of swallows \u2013 was extraordinarily nutritious. So much so that researchers believe he downed a bowl of it every morning before breakfast. \u201cThere are many myths and legends about bird\u2019s nest. It was a relatively new ingredient at that time,\u201d Zhao explains, noting that it didn\u2019t appear in a major encyclopedia on traditional Chinese medicines published in the late 1500s. Based on the historical documents, Qianlong had two main meals per day. His breakfast was at around 6 a.m. and dinner at 2 p.m. But right after he woke up at 4 a.m., he would usually have a snack \u2013 such as bird\u2019s nest soup \u2013 before his morning meal and work. At night, as he went through reports and requests from all over the country, he\u2019d have another bite to eat at 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. \u2013 often consisting of eight to 10 small dishes. \u201cHe usually dined alone except for the snack time at night, when he might be dining with a consort he was going to sleep with,\u201d says Zhao. \u201cTo dine and sleep well \u2013 so he could produce offspring \u2013 were also two main tasks for the emperor.\u201d Although being the ruler of the country did mean that he could enjoy the finest ingredients, he didn\u2019t always indulge. And both Zhao and the experts at Hong Kong Palace Museum agree that dining inside the Forbidden City wasn\u2019t as lavish as most people might assume. \u201cThe majority of (the emperors) grew up in a highly disciplined environment,\u201d says Wang of the Hong Kong Palace Museum. \u201cTheir diet was supposed to be healthy and to be studied by a lot of people already and tested by history.\u201d One of the biggest misunderstandings about dining in the Forbidden City, she says, is the assumption \u201cthat the emperors must eat like a million dishes, especially when you have that Manchu-Han Banquet rumor.\u201d The mythical Manchu-Han Banquet The myth of the extravagant Manchu-Han Banquet \u2013 often cited as an example of how the imperial family ate \u2013 was closely connected to Empress Dowager Cixi \u2013 a former royal concubine who controlled China ruthlessly for almost 50 years until she died in 1908. Cixi is largely responsible for the third and final stage of Zhao\u2019s Forbidden City culinary research, but to understand how she accidentally contributed to one of the biggest misunderstandings about Chinese foods in modern days, it\u2019s worth exploring the unique social and political situation in the decades leading up to China\u2019s re-opening in the late 1970s. It was a period of political and economic isolation for mainland China following the Communists\u2019 victorious emergence from a civil war in 1949. By accident, however, national culinary pride swelled toward one legendary banquet called the \u201cManchu-Han Feast\u201d (or Man Han Quan Xi), which first appeared outside of the Forbidden City in the late Qing Dynasty and was popularized at an expo in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou in the 1950s. \u201cIn 1957, at the first China Import and Export Fair in Guangzhou, one vendor had a sumptuous banquet spread for display,\u201d says Zhao. \u201cOut of the few foreign countries who sent their representatives, Japanese businessmen were intrigued. Japan\u2019s economy happened to be recovering rapidly after World War II. They wanted to learn about this lavish feast and asked a staff member about what kind of feast it was. \u201cThe clueless helper then consulted the boss, also clueless, who asked the chef. The chef wasn\u2019t sure either \u2013 but he had to give some answers, so he said \u2018This is called the Manchu-Han Banquet and it was started by the emperor.\u2019\u201d The Japanese businessmen were said to have been fascinated. From then on, the Manchu-Han Feast became synonymous with emperors and their meals, and Zhao says it became one of the hottest food trends in Japan. Dozens of gourmets and research teams traveled to communist China to find out more about this mysterious imperial diet that technically didn\u2019t actually exist. \u201cWhile mainland China didn\u2019t want to export such capitalistic ideals internationally originally, Hong Kong restaurateurs saw it as a great business opportunity,\u201d says Zhao. (In those days, Hong Kong was under British rule.) In 1978, a Japanese TV station worked with a Hong Kong restaurant to recreate and live-broadcast a massive Manchu-Han feast. The epic banquet was separated into four meals over two days. That only served to deepen the myth, leading people to mistakenly believe the emperor\u2019s feasts had to have 108 dishes spread across two days. After the country\u2019s re-opening, proud chefs in mainland China soon began declaring they could do an even more opulent version of the feast \u2013 one of them featured 1,080 dishes in one banquet, says Zhao. The fascination with this mystified imperial Chinese cuisine spread across East Asia like wildfire. Not even Zhao was immune from it. \u201cThat\u2019s why I decided to go find the truth myself,\u201d says Zhao, noting the banquets are what got him curious about Forbidden City cuisine in the first place. Empress Dowager Cixi\u2019s lavish meals So where does Empress Dowager Cixi fit into all this? Being the real holder of power behind the last few emperors of imperial China before her death, she was known for her extravagant lifestyle and appetite for exquisite Han Chinese foods. \u201cIt was the most lavish era during the Qing Dynasty. Their daily meals had increased from 18 to 23 courses to 25 to 28 courses,\u201d says Zhao. She was also a keen entertainer, hosting regular ceremonial feasts. While there were no official Manchu-Han Banquets, there were other types of imperial feasts held in the Forbidden City throughout the centuries. None of them had as many dishes as the rumors claimed. The most iconic format of them all was \u201cTian An Yan\u201d (translated as Increase Peacefulness Banquet), combining two main types of banquets of the past \u2013 the roast meat-heavy Manchu-style feasts and the Han style with bird\u2019s nest soup and seafood. \u201cBird\u2019s nest-style feasts featured many kinds of rare seafood products like shark fins, sea cucumbers, dried scallops and fish lips. Roast meat usually meant roast pork and roast duck,\u201d says Zhao. \u201cIt was an invention during her time with strict guidelines. Each of these banquets consisted of two hot pot dishes, four big bowls (main dishes with auspicious words written on them), four small bowls of items, six food plates, two platters \u2013 like sliced Peking duck or suckling pig, four types of pastries and bao, one type of noodles, one type of soup and one fruit platter. \u201cHence, even the highest form of Tian An Yan during that time had around 28 dishes at best \u2013 a far cry from the 108 dishes modern media like to portray,\u201d says Zhao. In a society with an increasing reputation for debauchery under Cixi\u2019s corrupt government towards the end of imperial China, wealthy patrons began creating their own \u201cimperial banquets\u201d inspired by Tian An Yan, and called them \u201cManchu-Han Banquets.\u201d This helps explain some of the confusion surrounding their connection to China\u2019s emperors. How hunger led Zhao to food history Despite having studied food for decades, Zhao is far from being a foodie. Quite the opposite, in fact \u2013 he says his obsession with food history stems from horrors he witnessed during his childhood in the three years of famine that followed the Communist leadership\u2019s Great Leap Forward economic policy in the late 1950s. \u201cThe memory of long-term gastrointestinal cramps due to hunger and the shock of the millions of deaths due to hunger in the 1960s are a nightmare that comes back and haunts me from time to time,\u201d says Zhao. \u201cI\u2019m lucky that I survived and it deeply affected my perspective on food.\u201d Because of this, he says he believes understanding the past will improve the world\u2019s future food security. \u201cStudying food history is a part of understanding our food culture in a truthful way,\u201d Zhao says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t only help a country promote its culinary arts but helps us reflect on food and the policies we have today. Who doesn\u2019t enjoy good food? But I didn\u2019t become a food historian to indulge but out of consciousness and responsibility, I want to firmly grasp the truth about it. Today is a continuation of yesterday so studying history is an important part of who we are today and in the future.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/china-emperors-food-beijing-forbidden-city-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_this-man-built-a-plane-for-his-family-in-his-garden", "text": "It wasn\u2019t until he moved near to an airfield in the UK over a decade ago that mechanical engineer Ashok Aliseril Thamarakshan began to seriously consider learning to fly a plane. He got his first taste of flying a few years later, when his wife Abhilasha bought him a 30-minute flight experience for his birthday. Aliseril, who is based in Essex, England, booked in some flying lessons at a local airfield and flew to the Isle of Wight, an island off the English south coast, during his first session. \u201cThat was quite an eye-opener into how (flying) gives you the freedom to just go places if you have that ability, and access to an aircraft,\u201d he tells CNN Travel. \u201cSo that really got me hooked.\u201d Aliseril got his private pilot\u2019s license in 2019 and soon began hiring planes for short flights. Amateur build But as his family grew \u2013 he and Abhilasha now have two daughters \u2013 the two-seater planes typically available for private hire became even less suitable, and he began to mull over the idea of buying his own plane. Aliseril briefly considered buying an older aircraft, and looked at some that had been built in the 1960s and 1970s. However, he says he felt uneasy about the prospect of flying his family in an older aircraft that he wasn\u2019t familiar with, and didn\u2019t think it would be a \u201ccomfortable journey.\u201d Aliseril began to look into the possibility of building a plane himself, reasoning that this would allow him to gain a better understanding of the aircraft so that it would be easier to maintain in the long term. After researching self-assembly aircraft kits, he came across a four-seater plane manufactured by South African company Sling Aircraft that ticked all the right boxes. In January 2020, Aliseril flew to the Sling Aircraft factory facility in Johannesburg for the weekend in order to take the\u00a0Sling TSi aircraft\u00a0on a test flight and was so impressed that he decided to purchase it. \u201cThis was pre-Covid, where travel was still very easy at the time,\u201d he explains. \u201cI ordered the first kit when I got back. And by the time it arrived, the UK was in full lockdown.\u201d Aliseril says his colleagues, some of whom had experience with building aircraft, initially offered to help with the build. But the restrictions brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, which had spread across the world by this point, meant that this wasn\u2019t possible. Undeterred, he constructed a small shed in his back garden and planned out the different stages of the project, which would be monitored by the\u00a0Light Aircraft Association, a UK representative body that oversees the construction and maintenance of home-built aircraft, under an approval from the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The rules for amateur built aircraft differ slightly from country to country. In the US, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has an\u00a0experimental airworthiness category\u00a0where special airworthiness certificates can be issued to kit-built aircraft. Amateur-built airplanes in the UK are investigated by the CAA, who will issue a \u201cPermit to Fly\u201d once satisfied that the aircraft is fit to fly. Although the start of the build was delayed slightly due to the Covid-19 restrictions in place in the UK at the time \u2013 the Light Aircraft Association inspector assigned to the project was required to visit his working space beforehand \u2013 Aliseril was able to begin in April 2020. While he notes that his engineering background helped in some ways, he believes that it was actually his home improvement experience that proved most useful while constructing the aircraft, which has a length of 7.175 meters and a height of 2.45 meters. \u201cThese aircraft kits are designed for any amateur to build, provided you\u2019re a bit hands-on and you\u2019ve got experience working with some specialist tools,\u201d he adds, describing the detailed \u201cIkea furniture type instructions\u201d with drawings that came with the kit. \u201cI would say generally, anyone can get involved in these sorts of builds.\u201d Lockdown project Aliseril completed the work himself, drafting in Abhilasha to assist with some of the sections that required more than one pair of hands. Their eldest daughter Tara, now nine, was on hand for tasks such as removing the plastic from each of the components. By the end of summer 2020, Aliseril had built the tail and the wings. He began constructing the fuselage section in October, when the next part of the kit arrived. Although he\u2019d initially planned to hire a workshop to construct the aircraft, Aliseril feels that creating a workspace at his home was the better choice. \u201cI could just step into the shed and work on it,\u201d he says. \u201cSo having everything just in the back garden really helped, even though space was tight.\u201d Each stage of the project had to be signed off by an inspector before he could move onto the next task \u2013 the Light Aircraft Association completed around 12 inspections in total. Once the majority of the components were constructed, and it was time to put the aircraft together, Aliseril moved everything from his home to a hangar near Cambridge for the final assembly and engine fit. The aircraft passed its final inspection a few months later. It was one of the first Sling TSi homebuilt aircraft constructed in the UK. G-Diya, named after his youngest daughter, was signed off for its first flight in January 2022. Aliseril recalls waiting on the ground anxiously as a test pilot took the plane he\u2019d spent 18 months building up into the air. \u201cHe took it up for about 20 minutes, and then he came back,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a big relief. I couldn\u2019t lift my head up to see what was happening (during the test flight).\u201d That first flight was hugely significant in many ways. \u201cWith these build projects, everyone calls it a project until it\u2019s first flown,\u201d he explains. \u201cOnce it\u2019s flown, it\u2019s always called an aircraft. You never call it a project anymore. That\u2019s psychologically a big step.\u201d When it was time to fly the aircraft for the first time himself, Aliseril was accompanied by another experienced test pilot. While he admits to being decidedly cautious, the test pilot was \u201cthrowing the aircraft about as if it was a racing car.\u201d \u201cI was feeling very nervous, I didn\u2019t want to put any extra stress on it,\u201d Aliseril explains. \u201cBut (the test pilot) was really pushing it to the limits. And it was good to experience that. I know that (the aircraft) can handle this much. \u201cOnce I landed, (the test pilot) clapped his hands and said \u2018Congratulations, you\u2019ve just landed the plane you built.\u2019 That was a great feeling.\u201d G-Diya, which has a range of 1,389 kilometers, went through a number of further test flights before it was issued with a permit to fly in May 2022. The following weekend, Aliseril flew with his wife and daughters Diya and Tara, five, to the Isle of Wight, where they took a short taxi ride from the airfield to the beach. \u201cThe kids were really happy,\u201d he says. \u201cSo that sort of freedom. And the fact that we could just do that on a Saturday and still be back by 4 p.m. That was a great feeling.\u201d They continued taking trips together within the UK, flying to Skegness, a seaside town in eastern England and the village of Turweston in Buckinghamshire, before Aliseril felt comfortable enough to take them a little further afield. Last Easter, the family, who\u2019ve been documenting their trips on their\u00a0Instagram account, fly_home_or_away, traveled to Bergerac, France, which Aliseril describes as their \u201cmost memorable\u201d trip together. According to Aliseril, G-Diya has flown over 300 hours in the past two years, traveling as far as Norway. Family trips For Aliseril, one of the main benefits of the plane, aside from the freedom it provides him and his family, is the friendships he\u2019s formed with other pilots. He was always mindful that owning an aircraft could become a financial burden, but has been able to get round this by working out an arrangement to share it with three others. \u201cTo get your private license, it costs quite a bit,\u201d he adds, before noting that many of those who\u2019ve taken on similar projects are either retired, or are people \u201cwho have the time and financial status\u201d to fund the process. \u201cI kind of knew that from the beginning, and thought I\u2019d take that risk and try to do it myself,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew that once it was done, I would easily be able to find people to share that cost. And it\u2019s worked out quite well (for me).\u201d \u201cIt becomes a communal thing,\u201d he says. \u201cYou always have somebody to fly with if your family is not available. Also, having other pilots who are friends \u2013 you learn from each other.\u201d Now that the aircraft is split equally between four people, \u201cit\u2019s only costing us around the price of an SUV,\u201d adds Aliseril. \u201cIt\u2019s more fuel-efficient in the air \u2013 it only takes about 20 liters of unleaded fuel per hour of flight,\u201d he says. \u201cSo the fuel costs are pretty much equal to driving.\u201d As for the cost of the build, the kit was priced at around \u00a380,000 (about $91,000,) according to Aliseril, while added costs including avionics, as well as the plane\u2019s Rotax engine, propeller and other supplies, brought the total up to around \u00a3180,000 (around $203,000). There was no hangar space at the airfields close to his home, so Aliseril decided to build a new hangar for the plane at an Essex airfield. The new hanger was completed in early 2023. Aliseril says he hopes that more young people will take on projects like this in the future, and points to shared aircraft ownership as a way to make things more cost-efficient, as well as form connections in the aviation world.

{"id": "travel_article_eva-longoria-searching-for-mexico-restaurants", "text": "You\u2019ll no doubt be hungry after watching \u201cEva Longoria: Searching for Mexico.\u201d Every episode is full of mouthwatering regional specialties prepared by chefs all over the country. For those wanting to follow in Eva Longoria\u2019s footsteps, below is a guide to the restaurants and locations she visited. Veracruz: Cradle of Mexican gastronomy Longoria visits the coastal state of Veracuz. Its position along some 400 miles (645 kilometers) of the Caribbean Sea made it a focal point for military conflict \u2013 and the collision of food cultures. \u201cThe people of Veracruz took this treasure trove of ingredients passing in and out of the port and created a whole new cuisine,\u201d Longoria said. \u2022 Longoria met chef Erik Guerrero, who aims to make fishing more sustainable in Veracruz, at Namik restaurant, where they enjoyed ceviche with hot beans and soft shell crab taco. \u2022 Next up, she joined actor and friend Ana de la Reguera for some coffee at historic Caf\u00e9 La Parroquia, Veracruz Port. Tap on the glass three times to ring for milk. \u2022 She headed to the lush inland mountains to meet coffee farming expert Itzel Mendoza at Cafetal Privado en Coetzala to learn how the precious bean is grown. There, they gathered flowers in the fields to be added to chicken stew, a salsa and a palm flower fritter. \u2022 Back in Veracruz Port, she met food historian Nidia Hern\u00e1ndez Medel at Chuchumb\u00e9, a cultural center, to cook some fried yucca, which is traced back to the city\u2019s African slave era.  \u2022 It\u2019s back out of the city to meet with vanilla farmer Norma Gaya, of Gaya Vanilla and Spices, for some vanilla chicken. \u2022 At El Tajin ruins, a Totonac settlement, Longoria met cook Do\u00f1a Marta. She\u2019s the founder of Smoke Women, which keeps ancient Totonac traditions alive. They enjoyed alcamaya (fresh-water shrimp) stew and mushroom empanadas. \u2022  Chef Luis Palmeros, a rising star on the Mexican food scene, introduces Longoria to traditional cook Do\u00f1a Rocio at Cuarto Blanco Market in the inland city of Xalapa (the capital of Veracruz state), for a traditional stuffed jalape\u00f1o. He then takes Longoria to his restaurant, El Cuarto Blanco, for his modern take on the dish. Jalisco: Birthplace of traditions \u2022 At Tortas Ahogadas El Pr\u00edncipe Heredero in Guadalajara, Longoria samples a torta ahogada \u2013 the region\u2019s beloved \u201cdrowned\u201d sandwich. \u2022 In Guadalajara\u2019s Santa Teresita neighborhood, Longoria samples a new preparation of native ingredient chinchayote at Xokol, a restaurant run by chefs \u00d3scar Segundo and Xrysw Ruelas D\u00edaz. \u2022 Longoria attends a charreada, a Mexican rodeo, that takes place at Lienzo Charro Charros De Jalisco. Afterward, she sampled birria, the celebrated goat stew from Jalisco, at the clubhouse. \u2022 Chef Fabian Delgado Padilla treats Longoria to mole with pork belly at his restaurant palReal in Guadlajara\u2019s Colonia Americana neighborhood. \u2022 At Lake Chapala, about 30 miles south of Guadalajara, Longoria meets with members of one of the oldest indigenous groups in Mexico, the Coca people, to talk about their fight to preserve their way of life and history on the lake. They feast on local fish called charales. \u2022 Longoria meets friends Mariana Padilla and Alejandra Pelayo at traditional cantina La Iberia in Guadalajara. Women weren\u2019t allowed in cantinas until the 1980s, Longoria said. \u2022 Then she heads to to the town of Tequila, where Salvador Rosales Trejo shows her how tequila is produced by Tequila Cascahuin using traditional methods. \u2022 Longoria and chef Fabian Delgado Padilla visit Yunaites, his casual restaurant inside a municipal market in Guadalajara, for gorditas topped with pork and mole. Nuevo Le\u00f3n: Where beef is king Say adios to vegetables for a while. Nuevo Le\u00f3n is the land of meat. In this state in northeast Mexico, carne asada is a go-to meal. And it\u2019s the cuisine Longoria grew up with in Texas.  \u2022 In Monterrey, Longoria met up with Alejandro Guti\u00e9rrez, founder of the Mexican Society of Grill Masters, to try the region\u2019s specialty: carne asada (grilled meat). In August, there\u2019s a grill master competition in Santiago, outside of Monterrey. \u2022 Tacos Do\u00f1a Mary La Gritona has been serving breakfast tacos in Monterrey for nearly 20 years. \u201cThese are the best tortillas I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d said Longoria. \u2022 El Jonuco restaurant celebrates the products of Nuevo Le\u00f3n with a focus on seasonal ingredients. They\u2019re known for their cabrito (roasted goat). The restaurant celebrates the little-known history of crypto-Judaism in the region, Longoria said. \u2022 Dona Lupita\u2019s Caf\u00e9, located in the backyard of her home right next to Highway 85 south of Monterrey, is famed for its legendary tamales. \u2022 La Divinita bakery is one of the most successful bakery chains in Monterrey. The founder uses local oranges to make a traditional dessert with Longoria. \u2022 Koli restaurant, run by the three Rivera Rio brothers, is a fine dining restaurant that aims to tell the story of Nuevo Le\u00f3n. Oaxaca: A gastronomic capital Nestled within three vast mountain ranges, Oaxaca is a magnet for food lovers in the know.  A thrill of any visit here is sampling the moles, as well as dishes such as tlayudas (thin Oaxacan \u201cpizzas\u201d), spicy hot chocolate and asado grilled in smoky market stalls. \u201cIt is on another level gastronomically, one of the best places I\u2019ve been to in the world,\u201d Longoria said. \u2022 Mercado de Abastos is a giant market on the edge of Oaxaca City. If you want your chocolate fix, the mercado is still the place to come. This region is known for its moles \u2013 complex sauces featuring many blended ingredients.  \u2022 Casa Oaxaca makes Oaxaca\u2019s famous mole negro drizzled over turkey breast. Longoria called it a magnificently complex and sophisticated sauce. \u2022 At Las Quince Letras, chef Celia Flori\u00e1n made Longoria quesillo \u2013 a stretched Oaxacan cheese --  with crickets and edible flowers. \u2022 In the area of Oaxaca located on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, several muxes, who identify as a third gender and are guardians of Zapotecan cuisine, cooked up stuffed pork with pineapple served alongside pureed potatoes. Longoria called it \u201cthe perfect combination.\u201d \u2022 The farming town of Santa Ana Zegache is the unassuming epicenter of corn. Corn has been worshipped for over 6,000 years and is still the beating heart of Mexican cuisine.  \u2022 In San Baltazar Chichicapam, Longoria visited a palenque (agave farm) run by Do\u00f1a Berta, one of very few female mezcaleras. The farm produces mezcal, the smoky liquor for which this region is famed. \u2022 La Cocina de Humo is a hip restaurant using local ingredients. Chef Thalia Barrios Garc\u00eda is known for her heirloom tomato salad with beet puree and herbal dressing. Longoria said it\u2019s the \u201cperfect dish.\u201d Here\u2019s the recipe.   Yucat\u00e1n: Defined by the Maya Mayan DNA runs through the recipes in Yucat\u00e1n, which has the largest Maya population in Mexico.  The state is located along the Gulf of Mexico and is surrounded by dense forests that isolate it off from the rest of the country. The Maya thrived here for thousands of years before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors in the 1500s. The region\u2019s geography and turbulent history have had a significant impact on the cuisine. \u2022 Ixi\u2019im mixes modern and ancestral techniques and flavors. The restaurant has its own version of the most famous dish from the Yucat\u00e1n, cochinita pibil. Chef Luis Ronz\u00f3n slow-cooks pork underground after it\u2019s marinated in sour orange and spices.  \u2022 Condimentos Enrique is a family-run business that sells recados (spice pastes) in Mercado de Santiago in M\u00e9rida. \u2022 At Huniik, which means \u201cunique spirit\u201d in Maya, chef Roberto Sol\u00eds makes onion tempura with black recado. \u201cI have never had anything like this. This is gorgeous, and it\u2019s delicious,\u201d said Longoria.  \u2022 In his home in Xoc\u00e9n, chef Alberto Kuku prepared one of the oldest dishes, Mayan chicken tamales, for Hanal Pix\u00e1n, a holiday celebrated by the Maya people that means \u201cfood for the souls.\u201d The food honoring the dead \u201ccan easily be carried back to the underworld,\u201d he said. \u2022 Chef Regina Escalante, who runs Merci in M\u00e9rida, showed Longoria how to make grilled seabass with mango, avocado and flor de sal. \u201cI\u2019d have this as my last meal on Earth,\u201d said Longoria. Here\u2019s the recipe. \u2022 At Uxmal, Mayan archaeologist Don Pepe cooked up smoked pork and bean stew. It cooks underground for 12 hours.  \u2022 Kinich in Izamal is famous for its queso relleno. A key ingredient is, surprisingly, Dutch cheese. See how it\u2019s made:  Mexico City: The city of tacos \u201cIt\u2019s crazy, it\u2019s crowded, it\u2019s noisy \u2013 and I love it!\u201d Longoria said as she walked the streets of Mexico City, where she lives part-time with her family. This region was once the capital of the mighty Aztec empire, known as Tenochtitl\u00e1n until the Spanish invaded about 500 years ago and changed its name to Mexico City. Here are the places Eva Longoria visited in the episode: \u2022 Tomasa is a Mexican bakery known for its conchas, a fluffy sweet bread with a crunchy topping.  \u2022 El Huequito in the Historic Center serves up delicious al pastor tacos, which are a staple in Mexico City. \u2022 Tacos Los Alexis is sizzling hot in the taco world. Owner Alexis Ayala uses his five-star culinary training to transform traditional recipes from his childhood into to-die-for gourmet tacos.  \u2022 Contramar in Roma, the bohemian part of town, is one of Longoria\u2019s favorite restaurants. Owner and chef Gabriela C\u00e1mara made her signature dish: pescado a la talla. \u2022 M\u00e1ximo Bistrot, a gourmet restaurant that marries French and Mexican cuisine, is run by chef Eduardo \u201cLalo\u201d Garc\u00eda. For Longoria, he made a roasted beet salad with rocket and wilted purslane. Best known as a weed, purslane is nonetheless edible and very nutritious. \u2022 Mercado de Jamaica is one of hundreds of markets in the city. At the street food stalls, Longoria tried green chorizo tacos and tlacoyos, thick oval-shaped tortillas typically stuffed with beans or cheese. \u2022 Casa Tochan refugee shelter is the first shelter for immigrants in Mexico City. The residents cook dishes from their homeland to share with their housemates.  \u2022 El Moro is an institution famous for its churros and chocolate. \u2022 Hiyoko restaurant in Little Tokyo cooks up a Mexican-Japanese fusion. Chef and restaurateur Edo L\u00f3pez whipped up tapioca tostadas, chicken skewers with ants and duck donburi.  After each episode, we\u2019ll add to this story with the latest locations where you can sample food featured in \u201cSearching for Mexico.\u201d  Sign up for CNN\u2019s Unlocking Mexico newsletter.

{"id": "2021_12_27_travel_what-to-do-flight-canceled-delayed", "text": "Computer glitches. Bad weather. Air traffic controller shortages. Holiday crunches. Accidents and investigations. Unruly passengers. So many things can cause a flight to be delayed or canceled. It\u2019s no wonder travelers are wary about making it to their destinations on time \u2013 or at all. (And even if they make it, their lost luggage might not). In the midst of a global IT fiasco on July 19 and a record-setting summer for air travel, here\u2019s some general advice for navigating a very complicated and frustrating system when flights are delayed or canceled. Avoid getting trapped at the airport As bad as it is to find out your flight has been delayed for a long time, or worse, canceled, it\u2019s better to find out from the comfort of home or a hotel room. \u201cCheck your flight status before you go the airport. Most of these notifications are not happening at the last minute,\u201d said Scott Keyes, the founder of Going.com. \u201cSave yourself the drive to the airport.\u201d  Keyes told CNN Travel that you should sign up for airlines\u2019 free text alerts on the status of flights when you buy your ticket. You should also download your carrier\u2019s app. You can also put your airline and flight number directly into a Google search bar to retrieve the status that way. That\u2019s also handy for friends or family who are on standby to pick you up. Keyes also suggested checking the website FlightAware to track larger flight trends across the country. Days ahead of the now-infamous December 2022 bomb cyclone, many US airlines offered their passengers a chance to change their flights for no fee. When you know a major weather event is forecast, hop on those waiver offers quickly, said Keyes, The early birds have the best choices of the remaining worms (that is seats and flights). If you\u2019re at the airport already  Sometimes, the delays and cancellations happen after you\u2019ve arrived at the airport. Once the bad news has been delivered, what should you do? Keyes said to head as fast as you can to the airline agents\u2019 desk \u2013 and get ready to multitask while you\u2019re in line. Fast is a key word here. \u201cIt\u2019s going to make a difference who arrives first. It\u2019s first-come, first-serve. Positioning yourself close to the desk can pay off,\u201d Keyes said. Then you might want to call up your carrier while you\u2019re waiting. Depending on your spot in line, it might be faster to get through to a call center. \u201cWhatever happens first, great,\u201d he said. Calls to US domestic numbers might have really long waits. Keyes suggested trying an international call center for your carrier instead. \u201cMost US-based travelers aren\u2019t thinking to call the Canadian help line for Delta. You might get through to an agent much quicker. They can all handle your reservations just the same.\u201d You can also use a self-serve kiosk, American Airlines says. \u201cScan your boarding pass or enter your record locator to see your updated trip details. From there you can also switch your flight and print your new boarding passes.\u201d The travel advice website Travel Lens suggests using social media to your advantage. \u201cNot all customer service teams are as helpful as they should be and getting in touch with them via a phone call isn\u2019t always easy,\u201d it told CNN Travel in an email. \u201cAirlines value their reputation on social media and platforms like Twitter [now X] are a great way to get in contact with an employee. If you do use Twitter to reach out, then it\u2019s important to remain polite and calm as this will work in your favor.\u201d Attitude and research matter  Whether you\u2019re dealing with an agent in person or over the phone, how you approach things can make a big difference. That starts with attitude. \u201cHoney attracts more flies than vinegar,\u201d Keyes said. \u201cLook at this from the airline agents\u2019 perspective. They\u2019ve been dealing with irate customers really since the pandemic began. The agent is the one who has the most ability to help you. \u201cAsking nicely and sympathetically is far more likely to get what you want than being a jerk about it.\u201d He had another tip when it\u2019s your turn to talk to an agent about making new arrangements: \u201cCome prepared to offer your own options already. Doing your own research is absolutely helpful.\u201d Your agent can expedite things if you\u2019ve already looked up new routes and possible suggestions while you\u2019ve been waiting.  If you\u2019ve booked through Expedia or another third-party site, you\u2019ll have to deal through them when there\u2019s a cancellation.  If the price is the same, Keyes suggested you book directly with the airline. In case something goes wrong, \u201cit makes it much more complicated with multiple sets of policies\u201d when you booked via a third party. US PIRG, a consumer advocacy group, suggests you avoid layovers when booking if possible. The more times you stop, the more chances for something to go wrong. The group also backs up the advice from Keyes to be nice and polite to agents but also says consumers should be persistent in trying to get the situation resolved satisfactorily.   Help from other airlines Cooperation between airlines could work in your favor. \u201cWhen flights are canceled, many airlines have the option of putting you on another carrier\u2019s flight because they have interline agreements,\u201d Lousson Smith, product operations specialist at Going.com, told CNN Travel.  \u201cThis means, for example, if Delta is having service interruptions but American is running a flight to your destination, you may be able to get on that flight.\u201d \u201cIf you elect not to be accommodated on a later flight and you book a new ticket out of your own pocket, you are entitled to a cash refund, though that may not help you get to where you need to go,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAs we all know, last-minute flights are very expensive.\u201d Trapped for the night   What do you do if it looks like you\u2019re not going to be able to fly out until the next day and you\u2019re not in your home city? \u201cAsk the airline to put you up in a hotel or give you a hotel voucher. They might do it; they might not. It\u2019s not required by law,\u201d Keyes said.  They\u2019re less likely to do it if it\u2019s weather related, he said, than if the problem is a mechanical issue with the plane or staffing issues. Many airlines have committed to offering meal and hotel vouchers in certain cases. The US Department of Transportation has a dashboard that tracks those commitments.     Get to know policies. For instance, Delta Air Lines says it will provide a hotel voucher in some circumstances when the delay is between 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.  Whatever you do, at least ask, Keyes said. A voucher for hotels and even ground transport and meals aren\u2019t likely to just be offered. Also, your credit card could be your friend in this situation. \u201cThe good news is that many credit cards offer travel protections such as reimbursement if a flight cancellation forces you to get a hotel, meals, etc.\u201d Smith said. \u201cThese travel protections are typically included automatically as long as you used the card to pay for your flight. Google your credit card plus travel protections to see what specific offerings your card carries.\u201d If your flight is delayed instead of outright canceled, you might want to weigh whether to wait at the airport. Depending your personal circumstances, hunkering down there for five or six hours might be easier than going to and from a hotel. Also, Keyes said, check whether there is a hotel within the airport. The Points Guy advises trying to get into an airport lounge if you can, where you can recharge your phone and rest more easily. Stay safe. If extreme weather is causing air travel disruption, trying to make the journey by road could be hazardous. Frustrating though it is to stay put, it\u2019s always better to arrive late than not at all. Travel insurance and receipts Consider buying travel insurance, advises Airport Parking Reservations in an email to CNN Travel. It said \u201cmost travel insurance policies provide additional cover for travel uncertainty. Additional [coverage] usually becomes applicable if your flight is postponed by more than 12 hours due to a strike, adverse weather or a mechanical breakdown.\u201d  The site also advises that you keep any receipts of airport purchases. You can try to get the money back from the airline later.  But keep it to the basics. \u201cAirlines only pay for \u2018reasonable\u2019 expenses though, so you are unlikely to get money back for purchases such as alcohol, expensive meals or extravagant hotels. \u201c  Refund entitlements for your flight The US Department of Transportation says you are entitled to a refund of your ticket cost because of a cancellation or \u201csignificant delay\u201d or \u201csignificant change\u201d to your flight and you choose not to travel. This is the policy for cancellations regardless of the reason the airline cancels. In cases of \u201csignificant\u201d delays or changes to itineraries, what constitutes \u201csignificant\u201d remains open to interpretation and depends on a number of factors. New federal rules say travelers deserve cash refunds when inconvenienced by their airline \u2013 not vouchers or travel credits. \u201cFrom now on when your flight is canceled for any reason, you are entitled to an automatic cash refund and it has to be prompt,\u201d Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told CNN when the new rule was announced in April. Tomasz Pawliszyn, CEO of AirHelp, said in an email to CNN Travel before the new rules came into effect that flyers should try to avoid vouchers. \u201cIf travelers are denied boarding, they should not volunteer their seat in exchange for perks or a voucher. If they do, they could be giving up their right to any additional compensation,\u201d Pawliszyn said. \u201cOf course, if the airline makes a compelling enough offer, they may prefer to take it.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2021/12/27/travel/what-to-do-flight-canceled-delayed/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_south-korea-trader-joes-bagel-seasoning-illegal-intl-hnk", "text": "One of America\u2019s most popular exports is illegal in South Korea \u2013 Trader Joe\u2019s Everything But the Bagel seasoning mix. The blend, which is popular with influencers and regularly spotted in recipes on TikTok, contains salt, minced garlic, sesame seeds and poppy seeds \u2013 the last of which is banned in South Korea. Travelers arriving at Seoul\u2019s Incheon Airport (ICN) recently have reported seeing signs specifically mentioning the Everything But the Bagel seasoning mix not being permitted. One poster on X, formerly known as Twitter, shared a poster from the airport. The sign had a picture of the seasoning mix and read in Korean, \u201cWe would like to inform you that the following products containing poppy seeds are restricted from being brought into the country as \u2018Papaver Somniferum L,\u2019 an ingredient of the poppy family designated as narcotic substance under South Korea\u2019s narcotic drugs control law has been detected.\u201d \u201cSeed products with narcotic substances have always been banned from being brought into Korea. Recently, the customs offices have been strengthening crackdown on narcotic related items,\u201d an airport representative told CNN. The poppy plant is a vital source for the same compounds which are found in painkillers like codeine and morphine as well as street drugs like heroin, although the seeds themselves don\u2019t contain any opiates. Recently, a blogger on Korean website Naver posted about their experience bringing Trader Joe\u2019s products back from the US to South Korea. In a post made on July 14, the blogger reported that she brought back 20 bottles of the seasoning, which she learned about online. However, they came out of the luggage conveyer belt with a yellow lock on them, and she had to speak with airport officials to explain why she had brought the forbidden items into the country. \u201cThere seems to be some confusion,\u201d she wrote, adding that other people from her flight also had their products confiscated. Ultimately, \u201cI gave up the seasoning bottles and then I was let go,\u201d she concluded. And South Korea is not the only country with restrictions on poppy seeds. In Singapore, the seeds are officially classified as \u201cprohibited goods\u201d by the Central Narcotics Bureau, but people who want to bring them into the country \u2013 whether in seed form or in food products \u2013 can apply for an exemption through the country\u2019s Health Sciences Authority. Last year, the Pentagon issued a warning to members of the military that consuming poppy seeds could cause a drug test to come back positive. \u201cOut of an abundance of caution, I find protecting service members and the integrity of the drug testing program requires a warning to avoid poppy seeds,\u201d read the memo. Experts say it would be all but impossible to eat enough poppy seeds to get high. \u201cPoppy seeds don\u2019t have nearly enough opiates to intoxicate you,\u201d according to an article published by the University of Florida\u2019s College of Medicine. \u201cBut because drug tests are exquisitely sensitive, consuming certain poppy seed food products can lead to\u00a0positive urine drug test results for opiates\u00a0\u2013 specifically for morphine, codeine or both.\u201d Countries in East Asia often have very strict anti-drug rules and long jail sentences for offenders. Singapore, for example, still uses the death penalty for drug trafficking offenses, including for marijuana. Last year Hong Kong declared cannabidoil (CBD) a \u201cdangerous drug\u201d on the same level as heroin and fentanyl. CBD is a chemical found in hemp and marijuana plants. It\u2019s non-psychoactive, meaning it won\u2019t get you high; instead, CBD is often marketed for everything from helping to relieve pain and inflammation to reducing stress and anxiety. Trader Joe\u2019s is a California-founded grocery store chain with more than 500 locations across the United States.

{"id": "2024_05_23_travel_star-wars-hotel-disney-jenny-nicholson-cec", "text": "In 2023, Disney closed a highly-publicized luxury hotel on the Walt Disney World property called \u201cStar Wars: Galactic Starcruiser.\u201d For Disney superfans, it was a time of high drama and schadenfreude as promises about the hotel\u2019s immersive world ran aground on the rocky reality of some guests\u2019 experiences. Now, a year later, a four-hour-long YouTube deep-dive has resurfaced details about the concept and spread the niche piece of Disney lore to millions of viewers. The creator of the video, YouTuber Jenny Nicholson, is known for her commentary on various corners of fan culture. Some of her most popular videos cover shows and movies like \u201cThe Vampire Diaries,\u201d \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d and installments in the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise. None of them are nearly as long as her most recent video, \u201cThe Spectacular Failure of the Star Wars Hotel.\u201d Over the course of 20 video chapters, Nicholson details her 2022 stay at the \u201cStar Wars: Galactic Starcruiser\u201d hotel in Orlando, Florida. The tale is likely familiar to Disney and Star Wars fans, many of whom heard about the high-dollar, high-concept hotel and its closure in 2023. Nicholson says she paid more than $6,000 for a two-night stay in the hotel, which was supposed to resemble a Star Wars-style spaceship called the Halcyon. The big draw of the hotel lay in what Disney marketing called an \u201cimmersive, customizable Star Wars experience\u201d that Nicholson equated to LARPing, or live-action roleplaying. Guests were encouraged to dress up, and through a combination of live experiences with cast members and choices made in a special app, were guided through a three-day-long Star Wars storyline complete with full itinerary and, if played to its full extent, very little downtime. With Disney-esque details like working lightsabers and colorful themed food, the experience was supposed to feel like a \u201clandlocked cruise,\u201d with all of the entertainment happening onboard the ship \u2014 in reality, a large ultra-secure windowless building near Walt Disney World\u2019s Epcot resort area. Nicholson\u2019s experience squared with some more critical reviews of the hotel: Cramped rooms, inconsistent experiences with technology and a general sense of confusion as to the purpose or audience of the venture. (She also mentioned, at length, some of the things she enjoyed, like cast member performances and details in the ship-hotel\u2019s interior.) Little of this is new information. Disney announced the closing of the Galactic Starcruiser in May 2023, and the hotel served its last guests last September. In a press release provided to CNN from that time, Disney said the project \u201cgave us the opportunity to try new things.\u201d \u201cStar Wars: Galactic Starcruiser is one of our most creative projects ever and has been praised by our guests and recognized for setting a new bar for innovation and immersive entertainment,\u201d the statement read. \u201c\u2026 we will take what we\u2019ve learned to create future experiences that can reach more of our guests and fans.\u201d Still, Nicholson\u2019s video netted more than 2 million views in two days, and has already wormed its way into the social media pipeline of memes and references. Some X users marveled at the fact that they willingly watched a double feature-length video about, as one user said, something they \u201cpreviously never gave a s*** about in my life.\u201d Why yesterday\u2019s drama draws today\u2019s audience Longform videos are an increasingly popular form of YouTube entertainment, and it isn\u2019t unusual to see older topics being reexamined in multi-hour \u201cdeep dives.\u201d Nicholson\u2019s video also combines several winning formulas into one: Disney, Star Wars, insider information (Nicholson includes pictures and videos from her time in the hotel) and, of course, failures. \u201cI couldn\u2019t care less about some dumb Star Wars hotel, but give me those 4 hours,\u201d one X user said. Consumer research from Google claims that longform videos are gaining traction among younger viewers and, interestingly, are even more successful when they cover \u201cfan culture\u201d content. \u201cThere is a healthy appetite for more in-depth exploration of topics such as film, TV, and sports,\u201d a 2022 Google consumer insights report reads. \u201cThese allow for fan-centric creators to share thoughts and ideas at length with an increasingly captive audience: 61% of Gen Z would describe themselves as a \u201creally big\u201d or \u201csuper fan\u201d of someone or something.\u201d Both Star Wars and Disney enjoy particularly loyal fandoms with elephant memories and no qualms about engaging the same topics over and over again. Even the tiniest details in a Star Wars movie or a Disney theme park have cult followings, backstories, fan lore and, of course, their own video deep dives. A spotlight on Disney\u2019s future Nicholson\u2019s video, while not exactly breaking news, drops as Disney prepares a new slate of innovations. Earlier this year, Disney announced a massive 10-year, $60 billion expansion program for its parks, cruises and experiences worldwide. That includes a planned 14-acre expansion at the Magic Kingdom in Orlando\u2019s Walt Disney World and an expansion of the original Disneyland in Anaheim. The company recently got final approval from Anaheim\u2019s city council to move forward with DisneylandForward, a nearly $2 billion investment in the Disneyland resort and surrounding areas. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to build on decades of innovation, creativity, and storytelling to bring new, exciting experiences for our guests,\u201d Disneyland Resort President Ken Potrock wrote in a blog post announcing the approval of the project. In April, Disney CEO Bob Iger said expansion plans for Walt Disney World are on track after the settlement of a long legal battle between Disney and the state of Florida. Iger said the decision \u201cwill actually enable us to pursue the kind of significant investment in our Florida parks.\u201d Disney enthusiasts are expecting a trove of new information this August, when the company hosts its annual D23 Expo that focuses on upcoming projects and attractions. While the Galactic Starcruiser hotel has now earned a place in the annals of Disney lore, renewed interest in its failure provides a new lens through which to see Disney Parks\u2019 ambitions and expansions. Will they live up to everyone\u2019s wildest dreams, or be the subject of the next four-hour YouTube deep dive?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/travel/star-wars-hotel-disney-jenny-nicholson-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_grief-camp-experience-camps-mackenzie-galloway-cole", "text": "When Mackenzie Galloway-Cole saw the reminder in her Google calendar, her first reaction was dread: Three days, blocked out with two words, in all caps: \u201cGRIEF CAMP.\u201d Taking a few deep breaths, Galloway-Cole tried to calm her nerves. Of the two words, it wasn\u2019t the \u201cgrief\u201d part that made her panic. The prospect of \u201ccamp\u201d was way more daunting. \u201cI was nowhere near as afraid of talking about grief as I was afraid of being in a new space, doing something new, alone, with new people,\u201d Galloway-Cole tells CNN Travel today. Galloway-Cole, a New Yorker in her late 20s, is a recent widow. Last November, her wife, Megan, passed away from a sudden cardiac event. \u201cLosing my wife felt like losing my center of gravity,\u201d says Galloway-Cole. \u201cEverything in the world felt upside down and I felt untethered to reality.\u201d About a month after Megan\u2019s death, one of Galloway-Cole\u2019s close friends sent her details about Experience Camps, a US-based nonprofit that runs summer camps for grieving kids. In recent years, Experience Camps has expanded its program to include an annual adults-only grief retreat. When the organization appeared on Galloway-Cole\u2019s radar, Experience Camps was accepting applications for its summer 2024 adult getaway. Sitting in her parents\u2019 home in Kansas, Galloway-Cole scrolled through the details. The MO, according to Experience Camps, is that bereaved adults gather to \u201cgrieve, connect and play\u201d in the beautiful surroundings of a historic summer camp in the Poconos. On the agenda: traditional camp activities including campfires, arts and crafts and sports \u2013\u00a0 interspersed with opportunities for grief-based connection and contemplation. Galloway-Cole wasn\u2019t a camp kid. She spent her childhood and teenage summers taking extra classes at local colleges rather than sitting around a campfire toasting s\u2019mores. And while camp as a concept sounded fun \u2013 at least if Lindsay Lohan in \u201cThe Parent Trap\u201d was anything to go by \u2013 Galloway-Cole was unsure of the reality of \u201csleeping in a cabin in bunks with strangers.\u201d But in the wake of her wife\u2019s death, Galloway-Cole had adopted what she calls a \u201ckitchen sink\u201d attitude to grieving: She\u2019d try pretty much anything in the quest to adjust to her stark new reality. \u201cAt that point, I was also just looking for any sort of way to form connections with other people in the grief space \u2013 trying to just create and build a community,\u201d adds Galloway-Cole. \u201cBeing a widow in my 20s, I don\u2019t have as many people around me who relate to that grief experience. So, when I found out about the camp, I signed up the day I found out.\u201d \u2018A big leap of bravery\u2019 After a phone call with Experience Camps\u2019 program director, Galloway-Cole paid the requisite $425 fee \u201cand then put the dates in my calendar and didn\u2019t think about it too much.\u201d Then, suddenly \u2013 somehow \u2013 it was June 2024. Seven months since Galloway-Cole\u2019s wife passed away. Six months since she\u2019d signed up for grief camp. In that intervening period, Galloway-Cole had waded through the heavy haze of grief to rebuild something of a routine. She\u2019d left the comfort of her parents\u2019 house in Kansas and returned to the New York City apartment she\u2019d once shared with Megan. She\u2019d gone back to her job working in nonprofit communications. She\u2019d reconnected with friends. She\u2019d gone to therapy. She started blogging about her experiences on her Substack, Good Gay Grief. Life wasn\u2019t easy, but there was some semblance of \u201cnew normal\u201d that Galloway-Cole embraced as much as possible. Interrupting this routine to embark on a grief-focused summer camp was daunting, to say the least. But Galloway-Cole put on her favorite T-shirt, packed her suitcase, mapped out the route via GPS, and readied herself to drive two and half hours northwest to Equinunk, Pennsylvania. \u00a0 It was the first time she\u2019d gone on a vacation or trip since her wife died. \u201cSo, that was a big leap of bravery \u2013 and a big milestone to pack the car on my own,\u201d says Galloway-Cole. Galloway-Cole and her wife loved a road trip. (\u201cIf it was between a flight or a 10-hour drive, we would usually drive,\u201d she says). But Galloway-Cole was used to having Megan in the car, by her side. \u201cThere were so many times we would take a 10-hour drive, and we wouldn\u2019t even turn on music, because we would just talk the whole time,\u201d she recalls. As Galloway-Cole got behind the wheel, she was acutely conscious of the empty passenger seat. \u201cI got in the car knowing, \u2018I don\u2019t have my companion anymore. I don\u2019t have my person. I have to find a way to get through this and do it on my own,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cAnd what that looked like for me was I put on a playlist that was high energy, trying to just sing along and keep myself motivated.\u201d Galloway-Cole sang as loud as she could as she navigated the concrete gridlock of New York City and headed toward the rural greenery of upstate New York. As she crossed the Pennsylvania border and got close to Equinunk, the views out the window got vaster, more verdant. Parking up at Camp Equinunk and Blue Ridge, her home for the weekend, Galloway-Cole felt her heart hammering in her chest. The nerves were in full swing. But almost immediately, Galloway-Cole began chatting to another recent arrival. \u201cShe turned out to be another camper who was also there for the weekend, who had previously been involved with Experience Camps before \u2013 so she knew what she was doing,\u201d says Galloway-Cole. \u201cI told her it was my first time and we talked a little bit about it \u2013 so I wasn\u2019t confused for long, there was someone helpful there right away to say, \u2018Here. Come with me. I\u2019ll take care of you.\u2019\u201d This first interaction was indicative of what was to come \u2013 Galloway-Cole was immediately welcomed into the fray. Only a couple of hours after arriving, she found herself sitting with other campers, making name necklaces to wear for the weekend. Threading beads onto the string, Galloway-Cole opted for her nickname \u201cMac\u201d over her full name \u201cMackenzie.\u201d She didn\u2019t usually skip straight to the abbreviation, but Gallowy-Cole figured she was about to share some pretty intimate stuff with her fellow campers, so why not skip the niceties? Opening up In the lead up to the weekend, the campers had been sent a schedule of activities, meals and sharing circles. \u201cI didn\u2019t memorize the schedule,\u201d says Galloway-Cole. \u201cI looked at it once and said, \u2018OK, I guess I\u2019ll figure out what all that means when I get there.\u2019 I think it was just a combination of nerves, but also I was open to letting whatever was supposed to happen, happen \u2013 and letting go and releasing a bit of the control. Just saying, \u2018I\u2019m here, I\u2019m open. And I\u2019m ready to see what this weekend is all about.\u2019\u201d That first day, Galloway-Cole found herself in a sharing circle with a handful of other campers and tried to embrace this mantra. She listened as other campers were candid about their bereavement experiences, watched as they oscillated between laughter and tears. Galloway-Cole stood back at first, taking everything in, feeling \u201cevery emotion on the emotional spectrum,\u201d but gradually she felt less daunted about the prospect of opening up herself. \u201cI was able to see how open everyone else was, in sharing their lives and sharing stories and fun tidbits about the people they love who they\u2019ve lost,\u201d she says. \u201cIt really empowered me to realize part of what\u2019s going to make this whole weekend so impactful is sharing, is pushing myself to share the hardest parts of my life with the strangers that I just met, minutes or hours ago.\u201d So, swallowing her nerves, Galloway-Cole started talking. She spoke about her late wife\u2019s love of basketball, and she was heartened by the reactions of her fellow campers. They were encouraging, nodding along. Afterward, someone suggested a game of pick-up basketball. Galloway-Cole was fighting back tears as she dribbled the ball, but she also felt a sense of lightness, a feeling of joy that had eluded her for a long time. It helped that everyone was so kind and welcoming. Galloway-Cole\u2019s fears about making friends were proved unfounded. While many of the campers knew each other already \u2013 either they\u2019d worked as Experience counselors at a kids\u2019 grief camp or attended previous iterations of the adult grief retreat \u2013 others were newbies like Galloway-Cole. And the old-timers and newbies were equally approachable. There were no cliques at grief camp. The campers ranged in age from early 20s to mid-60s, although the majority were around Galloway-Cole\u2019s age, late 20s to early 30s. In Galloway-Cole\u2019s everyday life, her grief sometimes feels like a stumbling block to connection with other young people \u2013 she doesn\u2019t always know when to mention her loss, can\u2019t predict how her peers might react and she\u2019s always conscious being a 20-something widow is relatively unusual, even shocking. \u201c\u2018Do I mention it? Do I not? Do I bring it up? Will other people feel uncomfortable? Will it sour the mood? Will someone say something and then I\u2019ll get annoyed that what they said was not what I needed to hear, because they don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m going through \u2026\u2019 Those are all the different types of thoughts that I unconsciously am filtering through constantly,\u201d explains Galloway-Cole. But at grief camp, everyone was united by loss, and everyone was there to talk about it. Grief was a fast track to connection, not a hurdle. Over the weekend, Galloway-Cole met other people who\u2019d lost their partners. Others who\u2019d suffered sudden, traumatic loss. Other people in their 20s. Other New Yorkers. Other queer people. She felt a sense of camaraderie and connection that she realized was sometimes lacking in her day-to-day life. While she\u2019s got a great support network of friends and family \u2013 who are also grieving the loss of Megan \u2013 there was something specifically comforting about meeting people going through the exact same experience. And while other campers\u2019 stories of loss were heavy, Galloway-Cole says there was also a consolation in knowing they were all supporting one another. \u201cGrief is so heavy, but it\u2019s the heaviest when you\u2019re holding it on your own,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd when you do get to share parts of it with others, it\u2019s like they\u2019re helping you hold up this boulder. At grief camp, there were 100 people helping you hold up a boulder, it\u2019s a lot easier to hold than when you\u2019re doing it on your own.\u201d Marrying joy and sadness For the Experience Camps team, this idea of mutual support is at the center of everything they do \u2013 as is the idea that a moment of intense sharing could be swiftly followed by a freeing, spontaneous game of basketball. Experience Camps\u2019 years of operating summer camps for grieving kids mean the team puts joy and grief on equal footing. \u201cJoy and grief belong together,\u201d says Jesse Moss, Experience Camps\u2019 marketing director. \u201cYou can\u2019t be 100 percent sad all the time, because you won\u2019t be able to function and heal and grow and you can\u2019t be 100 percent joyful all the time \u2013 because then you\u2019re just pushing your grief down. \u2026 But I think joy and play really can get rid of your inhibitions, and kind of break you down in the same way that grief can \u2013 and so you\u2019re just your most authentic self.\u201d Experience Camps\u2019 kids camps have been running since 2009, meaning a whole generation of kids has now grown up with the program. The adults\u2019 retreat launched in 2022, inspired by feedback from the organization\u2019s adult volunteers. Many of them had their own grief stories, but they didn\u2019t have much opportunity to share them with one another, given their responsibilities at the kids camp. The pilot iteration of the adults retreat was exclusive to Experience Camps volunteers. There were around 30 attendees. In 2023, they extended the remit, opening up the retreat to any adults 21 and over who\u2019d experienced the loss of a parent, caregiver or sibling. Some 60 people signed up. In 2024, the parameters expanded to include anyone dealing with the death of someone important to them, and more than 100 campers gathered for the weekend. According to Experience Camps, interest continues to grow with many people discovering the program via TikTok. The adult camp is oversubscribed, and Experience Camps are looking at ways of expanding the program. Experience Camps isn\u2019t the only organization to run grief retreats \u2013 take Camp Widow, which hosts conference-style events for people grieving a partner across the country, or the kids-focused Comfort Zone Camp. But most of the grief retreat options available for adults don\u2019t include \u201csilly dances and an egg drop competition,\u201d two highlights of Galloway-Cole\u2019s June weekend. Experience Camps, which relies on donations and volunteers, also prides itself on its relative accessibility. The kids camp is free, and the adults camp costs $425 a person inclusive of all meals and activities, with adult scholarships available on a case-by-case basis. While some adult grief retreats lean into the luxury, wellness angle, Experience Camps firmly believes the less glamorous structure of summer camp lends itself perfectly to the grief space. Speaking to CNN Travel, the Experience Camps team suggests that embracing your inner child via games, campfire singalongs, dance competitions and friendship bracelets is the ideal counterpart to heavier moments of reflection and contemplation. These activities are a break from routine \u2013 from jobs, adult responsibilities, day-to-day mundanity. The only real difference between the kids program and the adult version, says Moss, is the adults have more freedom to do their own thing \u2013 and don\u2019t have to be told when to brush their teeth or go to bed. \u201cIn your personal life, you don\u2019t get to be silly, and do competitions and make up dances with your friends anymore. That was something 10 year olds did. But at this camp weekend, you\u2019re talking about your grief, but you\u2019re also making up dances with your friends,\u201d says Moss. \u201cIt\u2019s a really nice balance of nurturing your grief, nurturing your inner child, playing again and being vulnerable and meeting people who are like you.\u201d Michelle Cove, Experience Camps\u2019 director of communications, suggests campers are also better able to navigate their way through tougher moments of reflection and contemplation because they always know \u201cjoy and play is going to be on the other side of it.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s really conducive for having these discussions, which you may or may not have if you\u2019re at a spa retreat with your girlfriends,\u201d Cove tells CNN Travel. The team suggests traveling is a great way of helping to process trauma, too. And it helps when the surroundings are so beautiful. Galloway-Cole calls the campground a \u201cmuch needed and wanted change of pace\u201d compared with life in New York City. \u201cThere\u2019s greenery everywhere,\u201d describes Galloway-Cole. \u201cThere\u2019s a lake, a big green lawn and there\u2019s a flagpole that we meet around every morning.\u201d During her time at camp, Galloway-Cole went for a solo walk around the grounds before each day\u2019s activities began. \u201cI would cross the bridge and head over to the lake. I would sit there, on the docks and just breathe some fresh air, center myself, wake up,\u201d she recalls. \u201cIt was really just a beautiful and tranquil way to start my day, every morning, to be alone with myself and my thoughts and try to connect with my wife a little bit before diving into a packed day.\u201d Making connections Experience Camps\u2019 kids camps have always been places where friendship thrives, and the Experience Camps team are happy to see this reflected in the adult campers\u2019 experiences so far. \u201cThe crossover between the kids camp and the adult camp is the word \u2018lonely,\u2019\u201d says Cove. \u201cHow lonely it is to be grieving. \u2026 And so having this space \u2013 whether it\u2019s for kids at camp or adults at camp \u2013 just to be with everybody who gets it, that\u2019s the star player.\u201d Since her wife passed away, one of Galloway-Cole\u2019s struggles is the idea that new people she meets won\u2019t get to meet Megan. \u201cI feel like they will never know this huge part of me,\u201d she says. But at grief camp, because she was encouraged to speak about Megan freely, Galloway-Cole felt as though she had introduced her partner to her new friends. On the last night of the retreat, the campers enjoyed some drinks and dancing. Toward the end of the evening, Chappell Roan\u2019s song \u201cHot To Go\u201d started blaring out of the speaker. For Galloway-Cole, this was both a joyous moment and a \u201cgut punch.\u201d The couple went to see the pop artist live last October, not long before Megan passed away. Since then, Chappell Roan has become a chart-climbing, global star. For Galloway-Cole, it\u2019s surreal and sad that Megan isn\u2019t able to witness one of her favorite artists hit the mainstream. In her normal life, Galloway-Cole might have swallowed down these thoughts and feelings \u2013 might have worried voicing them aloud would kill the vibe, worried about people\u2019s reactions. But at grief camp, Galloway-Cole didn\u2019t have these hesitations. Instead, she shouted over the music to her new friends: \u201cThis was the last concert Megan went to before she died!\u201d Rather than feeling like she\u2019d brought down the mood of the room, Galloway-Cole felt like she\u2019d just introduced Megan into the room. Her friends hugged her, cheered and the group spontaneously toasted Megan. It\u2019s a moment Galloway-Cole\u2019s thought about a lot since returning home. \u201cMegan\u2019s passing doesn\u2019t change the things she loved, it doesn\u2019t change the things we got to do together. And being able to just talk about her and who she was, and who she always will be, openly, I think is something that I will definitely bring more into my life.\u201d The experience at grief camp led Galloway-Cole to realize she can \u201ccontinue to introduce people to my wife, even though she\u2019s not with us anymore.\u201d She loves it when her grief camp friends reach out to mention something that\u2019s made them think of Megan, whether it\u2019s basketball news or pop music updates. \u201cThose are people that never got to meet her and know her while she was alive. But even they, through what I share with them, feel like they now have a connection to her,\u201d says Galloway-Cole. \u201cThat has been so impactful to hear from other people, and to see that she really does continue to be with me, and I can continue to bring her and introduce her to every person in my life that I come across.\u201d Galloway-Cole and her fellow campers are already planning future meet-ups and weekend trips together \u2013 as well as hopefully reuniting for the 2025 Experience Camps\u2019 adult grief retreat. Next year\u2019s applications aren\u2019t live yet, but those interested can still sign up to be the first to receive information. Galloway-Cole\u2019s also enjoyed sharing stories of grief camp with her friends and loved ones back home. She wrote a piece called \u201cGrief Camp is My Happy Place,\u201d for her Substack, describing her experiences. She set up a new, public Instagram to document her thoughts and feelings. \u201cI think a lot of people hear \u2018grief camp\u2019 and think it\u2019s going to be sad all the time. They think, \u2018Oh, that sounds awful, or how sad.\u2019 Meanwhile, I feel like I came back from grief camp, and I was the happiest and the lightest I had been since my wife passed, because I got to have such a joyous release,\u201d says Galloway-Cole. \u201cWe got to have those hard conversations, but also got to really experience community and connection and joy. And realize that it\u2019s OK for all of these things to coexist, because that\u2019s just what grief and a life with grief looks like.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/grief-camp-experience-camps-mackenzie-galloway-cole/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "travel"}}

A 29-day \u20ac5 reservation entrance fee and reservation experiment, which began on April 25 and ran on selected days until July 14, brought in \u20ac2,425,310 (around $2.64 million), according to\u00a0Venice\u00a0mayor Luigi Brugnaro. The city initially expected to collect around \u20ac700,000 (about $762,163) when the plan was introduced, the mayor had said in April. A total of 3,618,114 individuals made reservations, of whom 1,398,084 were exempted from payment because they stayed in hotels. Other exemptions included 651,254 workers who travelled to the city on days the fee was in place, as well as 466,819 students and 217,589 residents who were not required to pay the entrance fee. Additionally, 78,224 people were exempted because they were related to residents, and 107,146 were exempted for \u201cother\u201d reasons including being born in the city, religious activities such as the papal visit, and those participating in cultural events, according to data released by the city of\u00a0Venice. Saturdays are most popular \u201cFrom a first reading of the data it appears that day-trippers and tourists prefer Saturday to Sunday, and that during all 29 days of experimentation a peak attendance day, equal to that recorded on 30 April 2023, was not reached,\u201d the city said in a statement, adding that the number of people coming to the city on \u201cred flag days\u201d gradually decreased over time. \u201cThe experiment worked and we can move forward. A more in-depth analysis of the data collected in the autumn,\u201d Brugnaro said at a press conference Friday. A CNN team on the ground in\u00a0Venice\u00a0noted that local residents told them that the crowds seemed noticeably smaller than normal and that while still busy, the local residents felt that crowds leading up to the city\u2019s summer event, the Redeemer Festival, haven\u2019t been as bad as previous years. The entrance fee officially ended July 14, but the mayor\u2019s office said they will now determine if they should reinstate it during busy times of the year. No official date to do so has yet been announced. \u201cIt\u2019s a positive balance: The first 29 days of experimentation have finally given the city a tool that has allowed us to know how many people would objectively arrive in\u00a0Venice\u00a0and will be able to give us a way to act accordingly,\u201d tourism councillor Simone Venturini said in a statement. The mayor of\u00a0Venice\u00a0and two aides are currently under investigation for corruption tied to allegedly approving a 3.7-million-square-foot commercial property development by a Singapore developer in exchange for $164 million, according to police. Brugnaro has publicly denied the allegations, but one member of the council has resigned. The CNN team noted a banner calling for the mayor to resign.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/travel/venice-tourism-tax-millions-raised/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_when-your-home-becomes-a-tourist-attraction", "text": "Have you ever looked at a beautiful little mews house in London and thought \u201cit must be so amazing to live there?\u201d If so, you\u2019re not the only one. But for the people who actually do live in those homes, social media photography has changed what it means to live in a picturesque place. Alice Johnston is a longtime resident of Notting Hill, the London neighborhood famous for pastel-painted row houses and for being the setting of the Julia Roberts/Hugh Grant movie of the same name. Johnston,\u00a0a journalist, has complicated feelings about her Instagram-beloved \u2018hood. She lives on Portobello Road, one of the capital\u2019s most famous streets, and has witnessed all kinds of crazy behavior committed in the pursuit of the perfect snapshot. Once, she and a friend were walking his French bulldog when a tourist asked if they could \u201cborrow\u201d the pup for a quick photo op. The friend and the dog consented, the Instagrammer posed with the Frenchie in front of a bright blue door and then handed over five pounds as a thank you. Private lives, public places In that story, everybody had a good time. But there can be a darker side to living inside what some people think is a movie set. \u201cI was once woken up at 6 a.m. on Easter Sunday by French teenagers taking pictures outside,\u201d Johnston says. She shares another anecdote: \u201cOne time I was changing after I got out of the shower and there was this elderly man taking a picture (of my windows) with an iPad.\u201d Although the shutters were closed at the time, she was understandably rattled by the experience. When private homes \u2013 and the people who live in them \u2013 become tourist attractions, clashes can occur. In more rural areas, people can put up fences or other barriers to access, but when these private homes are on public streets in some of the world\u2019s busiest cities, what\u2019s a resident to do? Different communities have taken different approaches. In Hong Kong, a group of five interconnected housing estates nicknamed \u201cthe Monster Building\u201d became a huge selfie spot after it was featured in several Hollywood films, including \u201cTransformers: Age of Extinction.\u201d The mega-building is in Quarry Bay, a relatively quiet neighborhood on the eastern side of Hong Kong island that most travelers skip over. Residents of the working-class community are not able to block the building off due to the fact that there are public businesses on the ground floors. Therefore, some have taken things into their own hands by posting signs asking visitors to be respectful. A sign in English and Chinese erected by building residents reads \u201cThis is a private estate Trespassers are strictly prohibited from all kinds of activities (including but not limited to photographing, gatherings, use of drones and yelling e.t.c.). We shall not take responsibility for property damage and/or personal injury caused by any accident.\u201d However, many visitors ignore the signs or simply think of them as suggestions, and a quick scan of Instagram shows plenty of recent images taken there. Johnston says that a pale-pink house near where she lives has become such a popular photo site that the residents have given up on trying to keep people away. Instead, they\u2019ve put up a donation box asking people to contribute money to charity in exchange for snapping a photo. When your home is a piece of history Chuck Henderson\u2019s grandmother, Della, was a lover of architecture \u2013 so much that she was able to commission a home in California built by the world-renowned American architect\u00a0Frank Lloyd Wright. The Mrs. Clinton Walker House in Carmel-by-the-Sea, nicknamed \u201cthe Cabin on the Rocks,\u201d was completed in 1951 and passed into the hands of Henderson and some of his relatives when Walker died. No one lives in it full time, but the different family members and their guests take turns staying there. Wright fans will come from all over the world to try and get glimpses of some of his masterpieces. While some, like the famous Fallingwater house in Pennsylvania, are year-round attractions, others remain private residences. Many people who own homes featured in architecture textbooks have to add the cost of security measures onto other expenses like utilities and homeowners insurance. \u201cWe put these security cameras in after we had some vandalism about six or seven years ago,\u201d Henderson says. The vandalism in question wasn\u2019t graffiti, though. He explains: \u201cWe have this big wooden remnant of a tree that is placed as the centerpiece of the garden by the original landscape designer. Someone cut a notch from it. It looked clean, like someone used a chainsaw or something. One of our doors \u2013 between the carport and the main house \u2013 has a bunch of nautical cork discs in a rope net and is the counterweight for the door. That has been absconded with a couple of times.\u201d Stlll, though, Henderson and his family have the last laugh on the cork disc thieves \u2013 those weren\u2019t designed by Wright and are of little, if any, value. \u201cWe have people go walking right by the \u2018private property, no trespassing\u2019 sign. We\u2019ve had people dancing in our carport. We get a few people wandering up as a surprise, and as long as they don\u2019t do anything wrong we don\u2019t try to call the police. We\u2019re on a beach surrounded by road and don\u2019t have a lawn, but we had a family of deer.\u201d Coming to a compromise When it comes to living in a much-photographed place, some people try to take the good with the bad. Johnston tries to be sympathetic to travelers coming to her hometown, recalling how she loved taking pictures of historic neighborhoods like the Marais in Paris and Alfama in Lisbon. In fact, she recently found photos of herself as a teenager hanging out at the Notting Hill Carnival, years before she moved to the capital herself. \u201cI love to travel, so I have to be pretty understanding when people travel to where I live, and i feel lucky that it\u2019s cool enough that people want to come where I live.\u201d Henderson and his relatives have come to some compromises in order to let design buffs explore the home while also maintaining their privacy. They occasionally rent it out for photo shoots, such as a campaign by\u00a0eyewear brand Oliver Peoples. In addition, they open the home to the public one day a year to benefit the local Carmel Heritage Society. In 2021, 657 people came bought tickets and toured the property. \u201cFor us it\u2019s a tremendous pleasure to be able to share the house and see so many people happy and excited about it,\u201d says Henderson. \u201cAnd it allows us to be able to tell people when it is open. It gives them an option (to visit) and we don\u2019t have to be the Grinch.\u201d Still, it\u2019s not clear if anyone in the family changed their minds about looking after such a high-profile residence. Henderson and his relatives sold the house in 2023.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/when-your-home-becomes-a-tourist-attraction/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "travel"}}
