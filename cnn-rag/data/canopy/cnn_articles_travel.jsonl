Would you know what to do next? Beth Pratt sure would. She was once on the Old Gardiner Road Trail in Yellowstone National Park, enjoying her run in wild nature. Her reverie came to an end when she came upon a grizzly bear eating flowers.  \u201cI stopped. It stood on its hind legs and looked at me. I knew that wasn\u2019t a threatening gesture,\u201d she told CNN Travel. \u201cI\u2019m not kidding, it waved its paw at me as if to say, \u2018just go on your way,\u2019 and went back to eating.\u201d \u201cAnd I walked slowly away and put some distance between us, and the encounter ended fine.\u201d When it comes to dealing with bears, Pratt does have a thing or two on almost all the rest of us, though. She is the California regional executive director for the National Wildlife Federation, a job she\u2019s had for more than 10 years. She worked in Yellowstone for several years \u2013 and once saw nine grizzlies in one day there.    Finally, she lives on the border of Yosemite National Park, and bears will pass through her yard, including this one seen in the footage above in late September 2021. You can hear the enthusiasm in Pratt\u2019s voice as she shares her bear bona fides and advice to make sure bear/human encounters are delightful, not dangerous. \u201cA wild bear is a beautiful sight to see. It\u2019s incredible to see them in the wild. I never had a bad experience with bears. What I try to get people to feel is respect, not fear, for bears. The animal usually wants to avoid the encounters.\u201d  Bears in the news   Bear attacks are rare, Pratt and US National Park Service websites point out, but they do happen:  \u2022 A disable veteran survived an attack from a mother grizzly at Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming in May 2024. \u201cIt was the most violent thing I have ever experienced.\u201d \u2022 A hunter suffered serious injuries in a grizzly bear attack in British Columbia in May 2024. \u2022 Bear attacks are on the increase in Japan. \u2022 A man lost part of his jaw in a grizzly bear attack in Montana in September 2023. \u2022 Two people died in a suspected grizzly bear attack in Canada\u2019s Banff National Park in late September 2023. \u2022 Two collegiate wrestlers were mauled by a grizzly bear near Cody, Wyoming, in October 2022; they had serious injuries but survived. They illustrate the point that rare doesn\u2019t equal never. Feasts for beasts  While it pays to be diligent at any time, autumn is a particularly good season to bone up on bear facts and safety when many bears are in a phase known as hyperphagia, Pratt said. \u201cIt\u2019s a period in the fall where bears are eating anything and everything to fatten up for hibernation.\u201d  She noted mountain lions are comparatively picky eaters. Not bears.   \u201cThey eat everything: Ants. Roadkill. Flowers. Nuts. And unfortunately, human food that\u2019s not secured. Our food is very attractive to them; it\u2019s easy calories.\u201d   Combine that with the fact that some national and state parks have become very popular and crowded, and you have a recipe for potential trouble. \u201cIf more people are using public lands and more people are in the mix, there\u2019s more potential for encounters and conflict. It does concern me a little bit,\u201d Pratt said. The key is being prepared \u2013 and that\u2019s where Pratt and others in the know come in. First rule of \u2018bear fight club\u2019: Don\u2019t fight The best strategy is to never get in harm\u2019s way by enticing or provoking a wild bear. Trying to give a bear food or approaching cute cubs are particularly terrible ways to start an encounter. That\u2019s just looking for trouble. The US National Park Service site points out each bear and each encounter is different, but there are general guidelines useful in most situations. First of all, keep your distance if you happen upon a bear. Don\u2019t approach it, and give it plenty of room to walk away from you. Yellowstone tells you to stay at least 100 yards (300 feet or 91 meters) away; Shenandoah National Park in Virginia suggests 200 feet (61 meters) for its black bears. You can run afoul of the law as well as the bears if you get too close and end up paying a fine.   Other tips: \u2022 Talk calmly to yourself in low tones to identify yourself as human. \u2022 Walk with a group (we\u2019re smellier and noisier in packs) and stay on designated trails. \u2022 If you have a small child or dog, pick it up. \u2022 Don\u2019t put yourself between cubs and their mother. \u2022  Avoid direct eye contact and move away slowly, sideways if possible. Pratt said don\u2019t be alarmed if a bear stands on its hind legs; it\u2019s not considered an aggressive move. Almost all encounters are peaceful, Pratt said. Many times, people never knew they were even close to a bear, as in this YouTube video that shows two people emerging from a basement oblivious to a nearby bear.  What if a bear starts coming at you anyway?  If a bear starts making assertive moves in your direction, you have important decisions to make \u2013 and fast. First thing is: Stand your ground with bears. With either grizzlies (a subspecies of brown bears) or black bears, \u201cplease don\u2019t run. Bears can outrun anybody,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cDon\u2019t climb a tree either. They can also climb trees better than you.\u201d  New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Division of Fish and Wildlife (where the black bear population is growing) also has some tips: \u2022 Make loud noises by yelling, banging pots and pans or using an airhorn to scare bears away. \u2022 Make yourself look as large as possible by waving your arms.  \u2022 If you\u2019re with other people, stay together. Pratt said you can usually intimidate or bluff your way out of sticky bear situations, depending on the bear species and the situation.  But what if a bear is about to attack? You\u2019re now in the rarest of situations \u2013 you\u2019ve attracted a bear\u2019s attention. It didn\u2019t move off. It\u2019s started coming at you aggressively and fast. You think you\u2019re about to be attacked. What\u2019s next? One very crucial thing is to make a quick ID of the kind of bear, because your strategy is going to be different depending on the type of bear.  If it\u2019s a black bear, the NPS and Pratt have a clear message: Do not run. Do not play dead. \u201cYou want to stand your ground with black bears. Look as intimidating as possible,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cThrow things not at it but near it. Make that black bear intimidated by you. Let it know you are a big person. Pick something up; yell at it. If it attacks, fight back \u2013 aim for the face.\u201d It\u2019s a different situation with grizzlies If you\u2019re dealing with a grizzly that won\u2019t back off and an attack is imminent, you\u2019re advised to do the opposite. You should play dead. \u201cAct as unthreatening as possible with a grizzly. Play dead with a grizzly if it starts to attack,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cTuck and cover. Get into a fetal position. Wrap your hands around your neck. Lay on your stomach. Once you do that, 99 percent of the time the grizzly will move on.\u201d  NPS elaborates: \u201cRemain still until the bear leaves the area. Fighting back usually increases the intensity of such attacks. However, if the attack persists, fight back vigorously.\u201d   Fighting back a grizzly bear is the last resort \u2013 \u201cyour Hail Mary pass\u201d as Pratt called it \u2013 when all other options are out. An exception to this rule: If you\u2019re camping in a tent and are attacked, that bear likely sees you as food. NPS and Pratt say this is a time to fight. How do you tell a black bear from a grizzly? First off, know your area and read up on the bears there. In North America, grizzlies have a much more limited range than black bears do. In the Lower 48, they are in Washington, Montana, Idaho and Wyoming. And then in Alaska, too. They also cover large parts of western Canada. Black bears have more territory. They can be found in as many as 40 US states, much of Canada and even parts of northern Mexico, the National Wildlife Federation says. So say you\u2019re in Quebec, the Appalachians, the Ozarks, California or even parts of Florida, that\u2019s going to be a black bear. But if you\u2019re in Yellowstone or Glacier National Park, for instance, that could be a black bear or a grizzly. That\u2019s when it\u2019s crucial to know how to make a quick visual ID. You can\u2019t go by the color of the fur. Black bears can be black, brown, cinnamon, blond, blue-gray or white, according to Bear.org.  One of the best ways to tell the difference, Pratt said, is to look for a hump at the shoulders. Grizzlies have them. Black bears don\u2019t. She also said the face shapes are different. \u201cBlack bear faces look a little more cuddly to me, a little rounder, with a straight nose. A grizzly bear face looks more like a wild predator and has a dished shape.\u201d This NPS webpage has more helpful ways to tell the differences. Fun facts: Eight bear species can be found all over the world \u2013 from tropical Sri Lanka to the frigid reaches of Russia, Norway and Canada. And European websites such as Bear Watching Slovenia give many of the same safety tips as North Americans get. Bear spray and weapons Some people like to carry bear spray and/or a weapon with them when venturing into bear country.  Pratt is an advocate of the former and says be sure to practice using it first before going into the wild. NPS has helpful tips on using spray to ward off bears. She\u2019s more cautious about bringing firearms with you, especially if you\u2019re inexperienced. \u201cTaking a grizzly out with one shot would be tough. You need to be very experienced with a gun to increase your chance of safety.\u201d A Brigham Young University study in 2008 found spray more effective than a firearm. And spray doesn\u2019t permanently harm a bear. Some people like to carry bear bells on their hikes, hoping the noise will ward off the animals. But the park service says that \u201cYelling, clapping and talking are more effective ways of alerting a bear to your presence.\u201d What campers need to know If you\u2019re out camping overnight, you have extra considerations to take. Kyle Patterson, management specialist and public affairs officer at Rocky Mountain National Park, emailed CNN Travel some ways to keep hungry bears away. Patterson advised using a food storage locker if provided in campgrounds and picnic areas. Also, \u201cavoid storing food and coolers in your vehicle. If you must, store food in airtight containers in the trunk or out of sight. Close vehicle windows completely.\u201d Other tips and cautions: \u2022 Don\u2019t store food in tents or pop-up campers in campgrounds or in vehicles at trailheads. \u2022 Don\u2019t leave food, coolers and dirty cookware unattended. Park rangers may confiscate them and cite you. \u2022 Get rid of garbage in bear-resistant dumpsters and trash cans. Human-fed bears usually end up as chronic problems and need to be removed, Patterson said. \u201cA fed bear is a dead bear.\u201d The ball is in our court Pratt emphasized it\u2019s up to humans to be responsible to these creatures. \u201cThe bears are just being bears. We are way more of a threat to them. Bear attacks are so rare. And fatalities are even rarer,\u201d she said. \u201cThe bears\u2019 lives are more at threat than ours in encounters. I want people to have magical, wonderful experiences in the wild. I want people to feel OK about having these encounters.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/article/bear-encounters-prevent-attacks-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_article_how-to-survive-alligator-attack", "text": "Jeffrey Heim woke up on May 30, 2021, with one thing on his mind: Sharks.  Specifically, shark teeth. They\u2019re his passion and his business. An unsuccessful attempt the day before to find any of them only fueled his obsession to find some on his next outing, he told CNN Travel recently. So on a hot, sunny Sunday in Sarasota County, Florida, the 25-year-old Heim proceeded to the Myakka River on a spot about 45 minutes from the Gulf of Mexico. He had been there numerous times and was comfortable with plunging into its murky waters to find the teeth of extinct megalodons in the riverbed. He put on his wetsuit, mask, fins and snorkel and entered the water from the shore, not far from a restaurant along the riverbank.  Heim slipped beneath the surface. He was under no more than one minute when he felt something. Something bad. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything, didn\u2019t see anything. I just felt like a blunt force object \u2013 like someone \u2026 swinging a baseball bat and just whacking my head. But mostly what I felt was what I thought was a huge boat just slamming into me and just pulling me down.\u201d To his shock, it wasn\u2019t a boat.  He was in the water, alone and face-to-face with an alligator.  Gator attacks: Rare but fascinating   Heim was in a situation many people probably fear but very few actually experience: an attack by an alligator. An estimated 5 million wild American alligators are spread out across 10 states in Southeast and beyond, including parts of North Carolina and even the extreme southeastern tip of Oklahoma. Louisiana has an estimated 2 million wild gators in a state of about 4.65 million people. Florida sports roughly 1.25 million alligators (and more than 1,000 American crocodiles). Georgia has about a quarter of a million. Some of these gators inhabit places where lots of people live and many others vacation, such as lakes and rivers all across Florida and coastal South Carolina. Yet gator attacks aren\u2019t that frequent and deaths even more infrequent (deadly attacks from dogs and horses and other mammals are more common). There were 442 unprovoked bite incidents in Florida from 1948 to 2021, and 26 of these bites resulted in people dying, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conversation Commission. It turns out gators, in natural conditions, simply aren\u2019t that interested in people, according to Kimberly Andrews, a gator and snake expert with a doctorate in ecology from University of Georgia\u2019s Marine Extension and Georgia Sea Grant and who manages its Coastal Ecology Lab.  \u201cWe are not their prey. If you think about it, we\u2019re quite dangerous to attack. We\u2019ve got arms and legs. We can stand upright. We can walk, we can swim. \u2026 We\u2019re not a good animal to pick a fight with.\u201d \u201cUnless they\u2019re confronted, they\u2019re going to stay on their own turf.\u201d Nonetheless, people continue to be fascinated by such possible encounters. Overblown reputation     Andrews wants to dispel the notion of gators as aggressive, ravenous menaces on the move. \u201cThey\u2019re called ambush predators. We also call these \u2018sit-and-wait\u2019 predators,\u201d she said.  They\u2019re large, so it\u2019s \u201cenergetically costly for them to be really active. \u2026 We would be considered an active forager. We go out and find our food.\u201d Not so with gators. \u201cWhen you come down to it, they\u2019re not that maneuverable. Large body. Small legs. And this also plays into why the perception of their danger is exaggerated from the actuality.\u201d  Nonetheless, caution is advised when you\u2019re in gator territory, be that at golf courses, swamps, lakes, rivers and hiking and bike trails and fishing spots along waterways. Best defense: Avoid an attack  Education is key to avoiding a bad encounter, Andrews said. Start with knowing when gators are most active. Courtship season starts as spring warms up; mating extends in early summer; and in Okefenokee Swamp in southeastern Georgia, \u201cwe start to see eggs hatch out starting in September and October. \u2026 And that\u2019s when the females are most protective when they feel someone is threatening their babies,\u201d Andrews said. Your best season is winter: If it\u2019s cold, \u201cthey\u2019re not doing whole lot.\u201d When temperatures start settling into the 80s (27 Celsius), gators become mostly nocturnal. So it\u2019s best to avoid that refreshing night dip in unknown waters when it\u2019s hot. Don\u2019t provoke, don\u2019t feed, don\u2019t panic   Unprovoked attacks are rare, Andrews said. People are usually the provocateurs, not the gators. Gators can be disturbed or confused when folks have been known to try to grab them by their tails or go in for close-up photos of sunning gators Even worse, people will feed them. Then the reptiles start to associate humans with food. That\u2019s when gators can be most dangerous \u2013 when they\u2019ve lost their natural fear or disinterest in people. \u201cThey\u2019re more likely to take the easy way out and get our food than to do the work to fight for it,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cIn areas where we have high rates of tourism but not a lot of education and oversight of how people are interacting with alligators, we see feeding issues.\u201d  If you do have a gator encounter, she suggests staying calm and respecting its territory  \u201cSay you\u2019re kayaking, and you see an alligator, just keep going past it. Give it a wide berth, as much as the space will allow,\u201d Andrews said.  \u201cDon\u2019t take the paddles and slap the water. Sometimes people do that to scare the alligator off,\u201d but you\u2019re actually indicating you\u2019re a direct threat.  \u201cIf for some reason they start to swim toward you \u2026 usually try to go in the other direction and just show you\u2019re not interested. Or paddle right on by and ignore the animal.\u201d Also, never mess with the reptiles\u2019 children. \u201cWe always tell people that those one-foot baby alligators, even though they\u2019re so cute, they\u2019re the most dangerous sized alligator to mess with.\u201d That\u2019s because there\u2019s possibly a nearby mother ready to protect her young. More ways to avoid an attack   Authoritative websites have plenty of good advice to avoid a dangerous encounter. From the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory at the University of Georgia: \u2022 Don\u2019t feed ducks, turtles or other animals that share waters with alligators.  \u2022 Stay about 60 feet (18 meters) or more away from an adult alligator. If an alligator hisses or lunges at you, you are too close. \u2022 If you\u2019re driving, let an alligator cross the road. They move across roadways the most often in spring and summer.  \u2022 Supervise pets and children when you\u2019re in gator territory. \u201cLarge alligators do not recognize the difference between domestic pets and wild food sources,\u201d the SREL says. \u2022 Avoid heavy vegetation in and near the water\u2019s edge.  The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission also advises: \u2022 Never swim outside of posted areas, and swim only during daylight hours. Alligators are most active between dusk and dawn. \u2022 Get rid of fish scraps in garbage cans at boat ramps and fish camps; don\u2019t toss them in the water. Experts also advise people to call local or state authorities if you see alligators roaming around neighbors and other places you wouldn\u2019t expect. Do not try to handle the reptiles yourself. As for Jeffrey Heim, these tips were more than theory. Mission: Survival   Heim was in serious trouble, and he knew it. The gator had already bit him in the skull and on the hand. And it was coming toward him again. The gator \u201cpulled my mask off and pulled my head down towards my stomach. And then I come up, head above water. I no longer have the mask with the GoPro that\u2019s filming. And we\u2019re both looking at each other, and we both sit there for about two or three seconds, and I feel my head.\u201d  He wasn\u2019t sure what he was feeling at the time, but he learned later it was his scalp, partially torn off his skull and flapping in the water. Then \u201cshe lunges at me and I back away calmly \u2026  like I would with my experience with sharks, you don\u2019t want to act like prey. So I just backed away to keep my space.\u201d \u201cAnd then she really aggressively lunged at me \u2026\u201d  What to do if you\u2019re attacked   Heaven forbid you\u2019re that person like Heim who is being attacked by an alligator. Would you know what to do? If the gator is trying to drag you under the water, \u201cyou have to assume at this point you\u2019re fighting for your life, and you\u2019ve got to give it all you\u2019ve got,\u201d Andrews said.  \u201cWe recommend trying to poke them in the eye, hitting them in the top part of the skull or the side of the jaw. Those points are sensitive on alligators just like they are on us,\u201d she said. In a water attack, the danger is more from drowning than the bite, Andrews said. So get to land if possible. \u201cWe\u2019re better on land than they are. They\u2019re better in the water.\u201d But don\u2019t assume all is safe if you\u2019re on land. And the alligator has more in its arsenal that a fearsome set of teeth.  You can be injured if you\u2019re hit by the tail. Gators can also whip around with their skull and use it like a battering ram. Andrews knows first-hand how dangerous that can be.   She was part of a capture team once that had a gator taped up and its mouth secured when it unexpectedly whipped its head around.  \u201cIt actually hit me broad with the side of its head across my shins \u2026 and I blacked out. And I wondered, \u2018Oh my gosh, did I fracture my shin bone?\u2019 I had a lump the size of a tennis ball. It is amazing how muscular and powerful they are,\u201d Andrews recalled. The gator uses its mouth. Use yours. \u201cScream, make as much noise [as you can], not only fight back but make yourself as big and as much a pain in the rear end as you possibly can.\u201d If people are nearby, they should call 911 for help, Andrews said. If a pole is nearby, someone can beat on the gator and give it another target.  \u201cAnother person in an attempt to rescue you should never come in the water after you and the alligator. They can help you most by being on the ground and helping you get to the ground,\u201d Andrews said.  Other ways to fend off an attack   Here are some more survival tips from various wildlife departments and other experts: \u2022 If you can escape on land, run away in a straight line. Experts debunk the advice to zig-zag. Gators can move really fast on land, but only in short bursts and distances before they tire out. \u2022 Try to cause a gag reflex by jamming any objects you can reach into the back of the alligator\u2019s mouth. \u2022 Sometimes a gator will reposition its prey in its mouth. With its jaw back open, that is your chance to escape. \u2022 \u201cAlligators clamp down with powerful jaws, then twist and roll. If an alligator bites your arm, it may help to grab the alligator and roll with it to reduce tearing of the arm,\u201d according to advice from the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources. \u2022 Get immediate medical attention if bitten. Alligator bites often result in serious infection.   All of this is specific to American alligators, Andrews emphasizes.  Other crocodilian species in places such as Africa and Australia can be more aggressive. We\u2019re actually prey-sized for some of these, she said.  But the relatively few crocodiles in southern Florida aren\u2019t known for attacking people. The escape   One of Andrews\u2019 survival tips came in very hand handy as the female gator lunged yet again at Heim. \u201cI really backed away. Got out of that river as quickly as I could. I climbed out of the six-foot bank and stumbled over to the parking lot.\u201d He was about to pass out, but he was able \u201cto yell over to some people over at that restaurant.\u201d Fortunately, they heard his cries for help and were able to assist him with a first aid kit from the restaurant and call 911. While waiting for the paramedics, he wasn\u2019t in pain. But \u201cthe whole time I\u2019m sitting down just super loopy and exhausted. That\u2019s when I thought I was going to die.\u201d He ended up in the ICU in a hospital for two days but was back at work the next week \u201cwith staples in my head.\u201d  Lessons learned   Heim has now had time to reflect on what he did that day and on what others can learn from his attack. \u201cI knew there were gators there. This day, I basically did everything wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cI was aware it was gator mating season, but I went to the river with too much confidence, especially being alone, and free diving, which I had never done in that river before.\u201d \u201cThat cockiness, or confidence, led to the bite, honestly, even though this was an uncharacteristically aggressive alligator apparently. It was still the wrong time of year to go.\u201d  Like other young people who have spent time in the watery wilds in the Southeast, he was lulled into a false sense of security because he had been around gators before with no ill results. \u201cI was casually looking around for gators, but if I had even seen one, I had dove with them before and it hadn\u2019t caused an issue.\u201d \u201cI think the difference was this was near a restaurant, and fed gators are the most aggressive gators. So that\u2019s what the gator professionals believe contributed to this attack, too,\u201d Heim said.   \u201cIf you\u2019re going to dive in a river like that, which I don\u2019t suggest anymore, don\u2019t free dive. You\u2019re going to go up and down like their prey. And you\u2019re going to look much smaller that you actually are.\u201d \u201cWeigh all risks. Anything can happen at anytime to anyone. None of us are invincible. And I think it was the youth in me being a little too confident.\u201d  Heim has been chastened, but not chased off. He continues to search for shark teeth and has ramped up operations for his business, SHRKco. His approach is different now. He\u2019s more cautious. He said he has more and better equipment. He\u2019s even been diving back in the Myakka twice since the attack. However, he now goes with other people, including gator experts.  Andrews said it\u2019s crucial for people to co-exist with alligators because they\u2019re an Indispensable part of the ecology as an apex predator keeping populations of other animals in check. \u201cIn the South, they\u2019re part of our heritage. What a charismatic and iconic feature of our landscapes. It should be: We like our sweet tea. We like our grits. We like our alligators. This is part of who we are.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/article/how-to-survive-alligator-attack/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_what-is-canada-day-history-celebrations", "text": "Every year, three days before the US of A sets the skies alight with impressive fireworks displays as part of nationwide Independence Day celebrations, its friendly neighbor to the north pays tribute to its own origin story. That\u2019s right, we\u2019re talking about Canada Day. Many of us Canadians celebrate this annual July 1 holiday much the same way Americans approach Independence Day. We fly that gorgeous red maple leaf proudly and wear Canada-themed outfits. Some people paint their faces. Festivals and fireworks are all part of the proceedings, whether you\u2019re in Vancouver, Toronto or Charlottetown, with barbecues and pancake breakfasts among the culinary traditions of the day. What about jet planes, you ask? Our famed Canadian Forces Snowbirds aerobatics flight demonstration squadron will be making an appearance in our nation\u2019s capital on the big day. But while the two holidays bear many similarities, professor Matthew Hayday, chair\u00a0of the\u00a0Department of History\u00a0at Ontario\u2019s Guelph University, tells CNN that Canadians don\u2019t make \u201cnearly as big a deal out of Canada Day as Americans do about Independence Day.\u201d \u201cThere is a huge celebration in the national capital in Ottawa, which brings tens of thousands of people to Parliament Hill \u2013 those celebrations date back to the late 1950s \u2013 but in most other communities, it is pretty low key, with some communities organizing picnics and barbecues and firework displays, but nothing along the lines of the various parades that you see in the US,\u201d he says. Canada Day\u2019s origin story To fully understand and compare the two, you need to go back. Way back. US Congress established Independence Day as a holiday in\u00a01870 to mark the passage of the Declaration of Independence on\u00a0July 4, 1776. (In response, the British scolded the \u201cmisguided Americans\u201d and \u201ctheir extravagant and inadmissible Claim of Independency\u201d.) Meanwhile, the July 1 holiday to commemorate Canada\u2019s Confederation became official in 1879, and was originally called Dominion Day. It marks the day the British North America Act came into effect in 1867, effectively creating the Dominion of Canada out of three British colonies: the United Province of Canada (now the provinces of Ontario and Quebec), plus New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. \u201cConfederation was an administrative change, not a revolution,\u201d says Forrest\u00a0Pass, curator of Canada\u2019s Library and Archives, via email. \u201cThe editor of the Toronto\u00a0Globe\u00a0\u2013 precursor to the present-day\u00a0Globe and Mail \u2013 put it best in an editorial on (appropriately) July 4, 1875, when he noted that the\u00a0British North America Act\u00a0has \u2018none of the traditional associations of the Declaration of Independence, and is, to most people, only a piece of very dry, practical legislation.\u2019\u201d Even the choice of the date for Confederation was purely administrative, he says, noting the British parliament tended to sit in the early spring and the legislation it passed usually came into effect on July 1 for accounting reasons. But the desire to celebrate Dominion\u00a0Day owed much to the American model, Pass says. Residents of Canadian border towns traveled to nearby American communities to join their events, while some places with large American populations also hosted 4th of July celebrations. \u201cCanadians had celebrated their own holidays before Confederation, especially the birthday of the King or Queen, but even these observances had come to look a lot like Independence Day in the traditions that surrounded them,\u201d he says. For instance, Pass notes that in the United States, no 19th-century Independence Day was complete without a \u201cFederal Salute\u201d of 13 guns for the original 13 states, and a \u201cNational Salute\u201d of one gun for each state then in the Union. Some early Dominion Day celebrations featured a \u2018Dominion Salute\u2019 of one gun for each province. \u201cLike early 4th of July celebrations, early Dominion Day celebrations were spontaneous; they were organized locally with little encouragement from the federal government,\u201d he says, noting that Ottawa started to take an interest in how the day was marked in the 1950s, and encouraged some standardization. At the same time, he says both the media and politicians were quick to remind Canadians of the constitutional difference. \u201cMoreover, some Canadian newspapers in the 1870s took a perverse pleasure in reprinting stories about deaths and injuries during American 4th of July celebrations so that they could point out how peaceful and orderly Dominion Day observances were.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until 1982 that Dominion Day officially became Canada Day. Historian Hayday says there were dozens of half-hearted and more serious attempts to change the name over the years, dating back to the 1940s. In the end, the switch ended up being a bit divisive. \u201cTo this day, there are still pockets of Canadians who resent what they saw as a move away from Canada\u2019s British heritage with the dropping of the term \u2018Dominion\u2019 from the day,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the vast majority of Canadians now accept the \u2018new\u2019 44-year-old name.\u201d Pass, meanwhile, says the name swap was a\u00a0symptom rather than a cause. \u201cChanges to Canada Day, including the name change, have been part of a broader national identity and national unity policy \u2013 think the new national flag in 1965, the formal adoption of\u00a0\u2018O Canada\u2019\u00a0as the national anthem in 1980, and the creation of the Order of Canada as the country\u2019s highest civilian honor,\u201d he says. \u201cCelebrations today typically emphasize Canada as a multicultural and bilingual country rather than a white, British one, consistent with both Canadians\u2019 evolving values and government policy (it\u2019s often hard to say which of these is the cause and which the effect).\u201d So what can visitors to Canada\u2019s capital expect this year as the nation celebrates its 157th birthday? Ottawa\u2019s official Canada Day ceremonies will take place around LeBreton Flats Park and Parliament Hill. The Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), which turns 100 this year, will mark the occasion with the largest flypast conducted in 20 years over the National Capital Region, at 1 p.m. A series of live musical performances will take place on the main stage from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m., followed by fireworks.

Taquer\u00eda El Califa de Le\u00f3n, located in the San Rafael neighborhood of Mexico City, was among the establishments to garner either one or two stars in the first ever Michelin Guide Mexico, published earlier this week, making it the first Mexican taco stand to receive the honor. Chef Arturo Rivera Mart\u00ednez, who has been serving customers at Taquer\u00eda El Califa de Le\u00f3n for at least two decades, was presented with the famous white chef\u2019s jacket while dishing out his popular tacos on Wednesday. \u201cThe secret is the simplicity of our taco,\u201d Rivera Mart\u00ednez told the Associated Press. \u201cIt has only a tortilla, red or green sauce, and that\u2019s it. That, and the quality of the meat.\u201d Taquer\u00eda El Califa de Le\u00f3n, which is only about 10 feet wide, has been around for more than 50 years and is known for its Gaonera taco, apparently named in honor of Mexican bullfighter Rodolfo Gaona. \u201cThis taqueria may be bare bones with just enough room for a handful of diners to stand at the counter but its creation, the Gaonera taco, is exceptional,\u201d reads a statement on the Michelin Guide website. \u201cThinly sliced beef filet is expertly cooked to order, seasoned with only salt and a squeeze of lime. \u201cAt the same time, a second cook prepares the excellent corn tortillas alongside. The resulting combination is elemental and pure.\u201d When asked which drink he\u2019d recommend that diners match with the \u201cexceptional\u201d tacos, Rivera Mart\u00ednez told reporters, \u201cI like a Coke.\u201d Aside from the aforementioned Gaonera taco, customers can opt for three other meat-filled variations, including a bistec (beef steak) filling, served up on a plastic plate for around $5. \u201cWith meat and tortillas of this caliber, the duo of house-made salsas is hardly even necessary,\u201d says the Michelin Guide. Fine dining restaurant Quintonil, run by chef Jorge Vallejo and Alejandra Flores, awarded two stars, and chef Elena Reygadas\u2019s Rosetta, awarded one star, were among the other establishments included on Michelin\u2019s first-ever rankings for Mexico. Focusing on Mexico City, Oaxaca, Baja California, Los Cabos and Nuevo Le\u00f3n, the Michelin Guide inspectors traveled up and down the country to seek out the best culinary experiences on offer. \u201cWhat a joy it is to honor the uniqueness of the Mexican gastronomic landscape in Mexico City,\u201d Gwendal Poullennec, International Director of the Michelin Guides, said in a statement. \u201cThe first and very promising selection is an an illustration of how the country is showcasing its regions, with their cultures and traditions that are as distinctive as they are distinguishable.\u201d Back in 2016, chef Chan Hon Meng\u2019s Singapore stall became the first street-food establishment to be recognized by the distinguished guide.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/taqueria-el-califa-de-leon-mexico-city/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "2024_06_29_travel_europe-heat-waves-tourism-safety-intl", "text": "Growing up in Texas, Mary Beth Walsh thought she was accustomed to high temperatures. Her hometown of Dallas, which is currently being blasted by unrelenting heat, frequently experiences heat waves. But when the 21-year-old visited Athens in mid-June with her friends she was shocked by the \u201cunbearable\u201d 98 Fahrenheit (37 Celsius) heat\u00a0she faced. \u201cI actually had no idea about the heat that was going on until we were there, which was pretty surprising,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cI always joke around that I have such a high heat tolerance; I bring my sweatshirt with me to class in August (in the US),\u201d she said. But the apartment she was staying in had no air conditioning and temperatures were too high during the day to explore the city on foot. \u201cOur energy levels were lower than we thought they would be,\u201d she said. \u201cIt felt pretty unbearable to walk in the direct heat.\u201d Climate crisis-driven sweltering summers in Europe are now a reality that many tourists are waking up to. Interest in visiting hotter Mediterranean countries dropped in 2023 amid record heatwaves and wildfires, with more temperate destinations becoming increasingly popular, experts say. Recent heat-fueled deaths and disappearances in Greece, including that of the British TV personality Michael Mosley, have the potential to further fuel this northward shift, as incidents of extreme heat influence vacation decisions. The degree to which the travel industry and tourists alike can adapt to the rising tide of climate impacts is becoming a bigger issue for countries in southern Europe, many of which rely on tourism to boost their economies. Night shift The recent high temperatures have brought the climate crisis into sharp focus for some European vacationers. \u201cThe climate crisis that we\u2019ve been fearing will happen in 10 or 15 years is already here in some parts of the world. That\u2019s the scary part,\u201d Roo Clark, 28, from Suffolk in eastern England, who is currently staying with his girlfriend on the Greek island of Skyros, told CNN. \u201cFive years ago, me and my friends wouldn\u2019t have even spoken about it (climate change), whereas now it\u2019s more of a conversation.\u201d Authorities in Greece have repeatedly warned tourists not to underestimate the intense heat, especially during the middle of the day. Hiking in high temperatures has been a common thread linking recent deaths in the country. Temperatures in Greece are forecast to be between 90 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit (low- to mid-30s in Celsius) over the next couple of weeks, a few degrees above summer average, according to CNN meteorologists, except for one to two days when rain is forecast, which will keep temperatures down. Stefanos Sidiropoulos, who runs Greece\u2019s largest travel agency specializing in outdoor activities, said tourists shouldn\u2019t jump straight into activities. \u201cPeople that are coming from north Europe, or from Canada, places with colder temperatures, it\u2019s more difficult for them. They need time to adapt to these conditions,\u201d he told CNN. Sidiropoulos\u2019 travel agency, Trekking Hellas, now offers some activities when temperatures are lower, such as during sunrise and sunset hours. \u201cOr at night, with torches,\u201d he adds. Hooked on tourism Climate change\u2019s influence on where tourists are taking their vacations will have serious repercussions for some countries dependent on income from travelers. In Greece, tourism contributes nearly 38 billion euros ($41 billion) - around 20% of the country\u2019s entire economy, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council. In Italy, where level three heat alerts \u2014 the highest warning \u2014have recently been issued for the cities of Rome, Perugia and Palermo, tourism represents 10% of the country\u2019s economy, according to the latest figures, with one in every eight jobs linked to the industry. Following Europe\u2019s 2023 summer heat wave, which saw thousands flee from wildfires on the Greek island of Rhodes, there was a 7% rise in expression of concerns about climate change among European travelers, according to the European Travel Commission (ETC), a nonprofit association responsible for the promotion of Europe as a travel destination. This followed a decline in interest in southern Mediterranean vacation locations between the summers of 2022 and 2023, with cooler destinations like the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Denmark becoming more appealing, ETC told CNN. \u201cTravelers are increasingly aware of extreme weather events and their potential impact on their vacations,\u201d Eduardo Santander, CEO of ETC, told CNN, adding that in the future this could cause more travelers to visit southern Europe during spring and late fall instead of during the hotter summer months. For now, Santander said that tourist concerns about climate change tend to be relatively short-lived. \u201cTravelers are concerned after the summer but tend to forget about those events when booking their next holidays in spring,\u201d he said. \u2018Riddled with bites\u2019 Extreme heat is one consequence of climate change impacting tourist hot spots across Europe. But there are others. Warmer conditions caused by climate change are pushing populations of disease-transmitting mosquitoes into new areas of Europe, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Clark, the tourist currently staying on Skyros, said that the number of mosquitoes was very high during the heat wave in early June. \u201cWe were absolutely riddled with bites. There was no wind and even though we sprayed ourselves they still found a way,\u201d Clark told CNN. \u201cIt was definitely the low winds and high temperatures that was causing it.\u201d One key species of mosquito that can spread dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses, called Aedes albopictus, is now established in many European countries, including Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, according to ECDC. Andrea Ammon, ECDC director, said travel can contribute to the expansion of the species\u2019 reach. \u201cIncreased international travel from dengue-endemic countries will also increase the risk of imported cases,\u201d she said in a statement. Last year, ECDC recorded 130 locally acquired cases of dengue in Europe, up from 71 cases in 2022. There have been no locally acquired dengue cases reported in Europe so far this summer, ECDC told CNN, but based on previous summer trends they expect the first cases to be reported in the coming weeks. One human case of West Nile virus infection, spread by the native Culex pipiens mosquito, was reported in Spain\u2019s Seville province in March, according to ECDC. Last year, the organization recorded 713 locally acquired human cases of West Nile virus infection in nine EU countries, resulting in 67 deaths. Adapting to the \u2018new normal\u2019 Last summer\u2019s record-breaking temperatures across the globe were driven by a mix of human-caused climate change and the return of the natural , El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, which brings warmer global temperatures. This combination raised temperatures to record levels in parts of Europe, the planet\u2019s fastest- warming continent. But even as the impact of El Ni\u00f1o reduces, experts say that the long-term trend of global warming will continue. \u201cClimate change is tilting the odds in favor of more extreme events happening more frequently, and then becoming more severe,\u201d Rebecca Carter, director of climate adaptation and resilience at the World Resources Institute, told CNN. She added that high tourist numbers in some regions of Europe were putting already hard-pressed local authorities under pressure, as they juggle the need to keep residents safe from high heat as well as protecting visitors. Carter said that the travel industry needs to consider climate adaptation. \u201cIt\u2019s something I don\u2019t think the travel industry is thinking about as much as it should,\u201d she said, adding that booking rules could be made more flexible for flights and hotels, for example. \u201cWhen people plan these trips, it\u2019s weeks or months in advance and you can\u2019t predict when a specific place is going to have extreme heat.\u201d Some tourists, such as parents whose children are at school, have less flexibility when deciding travel plans, Carter said. In these circumstances, she said planning was key: \u201cWhat would you do if there was an extreme heat wave, and the power was out? Can you map out in advance where you would go for help?\u201d Sidiropoulos from Trekking Hellas agreed that forward planning was important, but he was keen for visitors to still get out and enjoy the beauty of Greece\u2019s culture and natural world. \u201cI always say to people who are travelling, \u2018don\u2019t stay in your hotel and just do the classic things like go to a restaurant,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou have the opportunity to see nature \u2026 and to see the authentic side of our country.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/travel/europe-heat-waves-tourism-safety-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_paris-catacombs-eiffel-tower-apartment", "text": "Charming. Historic. Romantic. Paris\u2019s allure remains undimmed. The City of Light is a shining beacon, welcoming in visitors from all over the world keen to indulge in a spot of joie de vivre.  For two years running, it has topped Euromonitor International\u2019s poll of the world\u2019s most attractive cities, winning out when it comes to tourism, sustainability, economic performance and health and safety. All of this will be on show when Paris hosts the 2024 Olympics and Paralympics in July and August, 100 years since the last time the Games were held on French soil. Enduring sites and streets of unrivaled beauty continue to make it such a big draw. From the traffic braving the Arc De Triomphe to the scene-stealing Eiffel Tower, via the ghoulish Catacombs and the resurgent majesty of Notre Dame, Paris is a place where dreamers and history lovers will always feel at home. Rising from the ashes It\u2019s at Notre Dame where Paris\u2019s past and present meet. Work began on arguably the world\u2019s most iconic cathedral in 1163, its position on the banks of the Seine making it one of the city\u2019s most striking landmarks. It bore witness to the French Revolution, Napoleon\u2019s coronation as Emperor of France and two world wars. But in April 2019, it suffered a devastating fire during a planned restoration, the blaze destroying the wooden ceiling and sending its spire tumbling into the cathedral\u2019s nave. Remarkably, the grand fa\u00e7ade, the organ, all the stained glass windows and works of art were only slightly damaged and remained intact. But in December 2024, Notre Dame will open its doors once more, with work that many predicted would take 20 years completed in just five. Two thousand sculptors, stone masons, carpenters and artists were drafted in, their expertise ensuring that the restoration has left the cathedral looking virtually identical to how it did before the fire. Philippe Jost took over as president of the restoration in 2023 and says the wooden ceiling presented the biggest challenge. \u201cThe oak structure, known as \u2018La Floret,\u2019 burned to the ground. It is now rebuilt. We searched for thousands of oak trees in the forests of France,\u201d he says. Jost adds that there was nothing that the team could not restore. \u201cYou cannot identify what has been rebuilt, because it\u2019s the same stone and type of work. It\u2019s the respect we owe the monument.\u201d \u201cI think we\u2019re at 85% or 90%,\u201d he says when asked about how close he and his team are to completion. The work here is utterly incredible, a testament to the fact that such craftsmanship still exists in the 21st century. The naked columns of the cathedral soar up to the ceiling; the walls, stripped of centuries of dust and grime, appear brand new. The cost of the fire hasn\u2019t just been financial. The careful cleaning and restoration \u2013 ensuring the health of the building for perhaps centuries to come \u2013 has stolen some of the mystical gloom and charm that visitors will remember, but that\u2019s a small price to pay for bringing such an important building back from the brink. A deathly detour Paris\u2019s past isn\u2019t just visible at street level, however. Walk into an unremarkable building in the Montparnasse district and take the stairs below ground and you\u2019ll find a very real reminder of the people who once called this city home: the Paris Catacombs. Six million souls lie buried here, in what is thought to be one of the world\u2019s largest mass graves. \u201cThese are all the people who lived in Paris for the past 10 centuries,\u201d says our guide as we walk past rows of skulls and bones, neatly arranged into the walls of these one-time limestone quarries. In the late 18th century, Paris faced a grim reality: overflowing cemeteries posed a dire health threat to its inhabitants. The solution was to take the bodies from these former resting places and move them into a dedicated ossuary housed within the city\u2019s extensive underground limestone quarries. The catacombs themselves occupy just a small fraction of the 300 kilometers of quarries that form an intricate network beneath Paris\u2019s streets. So vast are they that whole communities are said to live within them, with literal underground raves a cornerstone of the city\u2019s alternative party scene. The sheer number of human remains here cannot help but cause deep contemplation. \u201cThis whole theatricality is efficient because everyone who does the tour at some point thinks about his or her own death,\u201d says our guide. \u201cThinking \u2018Yeah, me too one day!\u201d Yes you can can While the dead make for a somewhat morbid distraction, there is something a lot more lively on Boulevard de Clichy, in a place that has been serving up a good time since 1889. The Moulin Rouge. The birthplace of the high-kicking can-can dance, it pioneered a new form of cabaret when it opened in the late 19th century, starting a craze that endured for the best part of 100 years. It was also a byword for the Belle Epoque period, when prosperity and progress pointed towards a better world. Today, it remains every bit as iconic (apart from the occasional mishap), its dancers dressed in stunning costumes that make their moves even more impressive. \u201cWhen you first start wearing it, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s easy, but I\u2019ve been dancing here now for six years so I feel like it\u2019s a part of me,\u201d says Jasmine, one of the dancers who dons these amazing outfits twice a night, every night. Each one is hand-made and tailored to the dancers, with more than three kilometers of the finest ostrich feathers used each year for these creations. They are meticulously crafted by Maxime Leroy and his team at Maison Fevrier \u2013 a prestigious feather atelier that\u2019s been in the game for nearly a century. They need to strike a tricky balance, being heavy without weighing down the dancers when they take to the stage and perform their famous kicks. \u201cIt\u2019s all about how you finish,\u201d says Jasmine when revealing how to can-can properly, explaining that you need to stand up straight and aim for a classic kick with a straight leg. It\u2019s not as easy as it sounds and even harder to do. It\u2019s why, perhaps, the Moulin Rouge endures to this day. A foodie paradise The French aren\u2019t known for their patience, but when it comes to food, they take their time. Like waiting in line, no matter how long, for their morning baguette. Modern technology has streamlined many aspects of bread production. Yet in Paris, there\u2019s still a strong tradition of artisanal craftsmanship and patrons are willing to pay a bit more for it. In fact, in 2022 UNESCO added the French baguette to its list of cultural heritage items, recognizing its significance and importance to the French way of life. And while baking your own is unlikely to match up to one you buy, you can at least have a go at that other Parisian staple, the omelet. And no one knows how to make one better than chef Yannick Alleno. With 16 Michelin stars under his belt, he knows what he\u2019s talking about. In fact, he says that when training new chefs, an omelet is the best dish for them to start with. \u201cYou have to tell them to make an omelet,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is the most difficult thing to realize. Because you\u2019re using two hands. You move the pan and you have to look and control the fire under. Cooking is a dance with the fire. You should know how to dance with the fire. The omelet is the perfect thing for that.\u201d Alleno\u2019s method requires four eggs, milk and a grinding of pepper, before cooking over a high heat, rolling the pan as you go to ensure it\u2019s properly cooked but never hard on the edges. \u201cBecause we are in France\u2026pepper (in the mix), butter on the top. That\u2019s what I like,\u201d grins Alleno as he works his magic. It might seem a simple dish, but eat an omelet in Paris and you\u2019ll leave dreaming of making your own in the same way. The Eiffel Tower\u2019s little-known apartment Of course, no trip to Paris would be complete without taking the time to scale the Eiffel Tower. The city\u2019s tallest building and its most iconic site, it is the symbol not just of Paris, but of France too. And few people know as much about it as tour guide Jose Ruiz Cobo. Cobo is an Eiffel Tower veteran, having worked here for 21 years, but says he never tires of climbing this most incredible of buildings. \u201cEspecially this early when there\u2019s no one here and you can really enjoy the view,\u201d he says as we head towards the top at the start of the day. For Cobo though, the public viewing area at the top isn\u2019t the most special part of the Eiffel Tower. Instead, it\u2019s the private apartment of Gustav Eiffel, the engineer who came up with this amazing structure. Found at the tip of the tower, this small space is stuffed full of history, a place for its creator to contemplate his greatest achievement, a building meant to stand for just 20 years after its construction for the 1889 World Exhibition. The 100-meter square apartment was slimmed down to make way for public restrooms, but remains as magical as you would imagine. And despite countless offers, Eiffel refused to allow tenants to take up residence. \u201cThey offered huge sums of money to rent it for a night,\u201d says Cobo. \u201cBut he was so obsessed with science that he refused. He would only bring family, friends and scientists. The most famous guest is probably\u2026 Thomas Albert Edison who brought his recording device.\u201d It\u2019s part of the Eiffel Tower that few realize is here. Not that the view alone isn\u2019t reason enough to queue for hours on end, of course. It\u2019s undoubtedly the best way to see all of Paris, a city that\u2019s impossible not to love. The views in all directions are quite magnificent, imbuing visitors with the urge to see and experience as much of it before they have to depart.

{"id": "2024_05_28_travel_bolivia-cuisine-top-restaurants-dishes", "text": "Bolivia doesn\u2019t seem like an obvious foodie destination. But the big, landlocked South American country is making waves in the culinary world via top-notch restaurants and transforming foodways pioneered by the ancient Inca and Aymara peoples into modern fusion dishes. Capital city La Paz boasts three eateries \u2014 Gustu, Ancestral and Phayawi \u2014 currently ranked among the top 100 restaurants in Latin America. And more are waiting in the wings. And it\u2019s not just La Paz. Bolivia\u2019s food revolution has also spread to major cities such as Sucre as well as the Uyuni Salt Flats. The new Bolivian cuisine kicked off about a decade ago, according to Marsia Taha, head chef at Gustu. \u201cThere was a generation of new chefs that had a mindset that we should be proud about our identity and our culture and our food,\u201d Taha said. Taha and other likeminded chefs in La Paz coalesced around the concept of \u201czero-kilometer cuisine\u201d \u2014 using as many ingredients as possible that are raised or grown locally and having direct contact with the ranchers or farmers that provide those things. \u201cBy showing that we believe in local products, we were able to show people that Bolivian cuisine could be as great as things coming from outside the country,\u201d adds Sebasti\u00e1n Gim\u00e9nez, chef and co-owner of Ancestral. Revolutionizing Bolivian cuisine It\u2019s not surprising that Gustu has been counted among the continent\u2019s elite dining destinations since first opening its doors in 2013. Co-founder Claus Meyer is a Danish culinary legend who helped pioneer the New Nordic food movement at the Michelin three-star Noma restaurant in Copenhagen, and Gustu is always mentioned among the continent\u2019s top restaurants. Merging Bolivia\u2019s traditional ingredients and food culture with the contemporary Nordic model, Taha and Meyer fashioned a gastronomic melting pot that truly lives up to its name (gustu means \u201cdelicious\u201d in the Quechua language of the Andes). Among the signature dishes are raw Lake Titicaca trout with mango; llama with Amazonian vanilla and ajipa root; Amazon fish with goldenberries and a fermented yuca (cassava); and an out-of-this-world lamb tamale. Taha says that even after a decade in business, she and Gustu\u2019s other chefs are able to keep the concept fresh by traveling around Bolivia to learn about new ingredients and foodways. \u201cLearning how people cook, how they grow their food, and so on. We also give a lot of liberty to our chefs to bring in new ideas.\u201d Variations on the theme Located in the trendy Achumani neighborhood on the south side of La Paz, Ancestral occupies a cozy basement location with floor-to-ceiling windows looking out on a sunken garden. The food is new Bolivian with Basque and Nordic undertones, but the concept is open fire or parrilla-style cooking that revolves around the wood-stoked grill and oven. \u201cWe\u2019re inspired by the biodiversity of Bolivia,\u201d says chef Sebasti\u00e1n Gim\u00e9nez. \u201cWe have jungle, valleys, altiplano, and very high places. We are also inspired by local products and local techniques. We only use Bolivian products, and we only serve Bolivian wines.\u201d But don\u2019t expect traditional Andean or Amazon dishes. Ancestral offers a delicious fusion of old and new in offerings such as the chulet\u00f3n ribeye steak, trout ceviche with grilled corn and sweet potato, and porchetta pork roast with Bolivian tubers and red aji sauce. Manq\u2019a takes another tack. Rather than fine dining, the ambience is decidedly casual, the tables spread across three floors of an old wooden townhouse in the boho Sopocachi neighborhood of central La Paz. It\u2019s especially busy at lunch, a mixed bag of local shoppers, politicians, students and the occasional tourist savoring dishes such as sopa de man\u00ed (peanut soup), gratinated cheese and native potatoes with humacha sauce, soft baked keper\u00ed beef from eastern Bolivia, and surubi catfish from the Amazon served with quinoa, tucupi cassava and edible flowers. Food of the devil The chefs at these top-shelf restaurants don\u2019t have to look far for basic ingredients. Many of the building blocks of their fusion foods are native to the Andes valleys and foothills that extend all the way along Bolivia\u2019s western side from Lake Titicaca to Argentina. More than 4,000 potato types are cultivated in Bolivia and its Andean neighbors, many of them found in just a single, small valley. They come in various shapes, sizes, colors and slightly different flavors. Even more than spuds, Bolivians cherish their quinoa. The country boasts more than 3,100 varieties of quinoa, which contrary to popular opinion is actually the seed of a flowering pseudocereal plant rather than a true grain. An exhibit at the new visitor center in the silver mining town of San Crist\u00f3bal points out that Spanish conquistadors and padres considered quinoa the \u201cfood of the devil\u201d and banned its consumption as a way to control the local indigenous people. Five centuries later, NASA declared quinoa \u201cthe perfect food to grow in indoor greenhouses\u201d during long voyages in outer space because of its resistance to adverse conditions (such as growing in the Andes), versatility and high protein content. No longer vilified as Satan\u2019s feast, it\u2019s also an ideal ingredient for Bolivia\u2019s new-wave cuisine. Zero-kilometer goes wider Sucre, the nation\u2019s judicial capital in south-central Bolivia, isn\u2019t as cosmopolitan as La Paz when it comes to food. But it\u2019s gradually catching up. Located across the street from the city\u2019s Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe, Joy Ride Cafe was founded as a tourist restaurant but evolved into a local hangout for date nights, after-work parties and Sucrense craving burgers, pasta and other global eats. But right down the block is the fusion fare of El Solar. The seven-course degustation menu features dishes such as seafood rice flavored with Amazonian citrus juice, pork belly with pepper sauce and a creamy puree made from plantain and yuca; and beef loin with charque (llama jerky). All of this for 80 bolivianos (roughly $12). Located in southwest Bolivia about 300 miles (500 kilometers) south of La Paz, the otherworldly Salar de Uyuni is the world\u2019s largest and most spectacular salt flat as well as Bolivia\u2019s top tourist attraction. Once upon a time, it was primarily a backpacker destination, but in recent years, more well-heeled travelers (and social media influencers) have sparked a transformation of the local dining scene. Tika restaurant at the Jardines de Uyuni Hotel looks ordinary from the outside, but the kitchen creates Andean-inspired dishes that easily match anything found in Bolivia\u2019s big cities. Chef Tania L\u00f3pez also uses the term \u201czero-kilometer cuisine\u201d to describe the menu at Tika. Among her signature dishes are a sun-dried, shredded llama jerky with local white cheese and a piquant yellow chili pepper sauce, bubbling k\u2019alaphurka corn soup, and lake trout filets in a basil pesto \u201clagoon\u201d with quinoa risotto. L\u00f3pez says one of the closest dishes at Tika to what the ancient Inca may have eaten is the llama potojchi. \u201cPreparation takes more time than beef,\u201d she explains of a succulent dish that resembles goulash. \u201cWe still do this in the traditional way from many centuries ago \u2014 heated on lava rocks.\u201d Dishes that the Incas never tasted \u2014 but would probably die for \u2014 are Tika\u2019s house-made desserts, in particular the quinoa and purple corn ice creams. Tika also does upscale takeaway, meals for a remote picnic that diners can enable on their own or via a 4x4 adventure with Hidalgo Tours, which sets up a table, chairs and bar at a remote location in the middle of the salt flat.\u00a0\u00a0 But that\u2019s not to say that Bolivia\u2019s food revolution has reached every nook and cranny. An hour boat ride from the mainland in the middle of Lake Titicaca, the Isla del Sol (Island of the Sun) is the legendary birthplace of Inca civilization and a place still deeply rooted in the Andean past. On its open-air terrace overlooking the water, the island\u2019s Tacana restaurant serves a traditional pachamanca lunch that includes llama, lake fish, potatoes, corn and other locally sourced dishes \u2014 not all that different than what the Inca rulers would have eaten during their pilgrimages to the island more than 500 years ago.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/travel/bolivia-cuisine-top-restaurants-dishes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_best-towns-america-2024-intro", "text": "You\u2019ve elbowed into the Empire State Building, admired the architecture along the Chicago River and huffed and puffed up and down the streets of San Francisco. Big US cities have attractions in spades \u2014 and crowds, too. This summer, we\u2019re looking at smaller cities that aren\u2019t already at the top of everyone\u2019s travel list \u2014 places where you\u2019ll often find small-town vibes and loads of personality as well as plenty to see and do for a few days or more. At CNN Travel, we tapped our network of contributors for nominations for our inaugural list of America\u2019s Best Towns to Visit. We evaluated their favorites and winnowed the finalists to 10 by looking at each town\u2019s attractions, food and beverage offerings, nightlife and cultural scene, sense of identity, proximity to other interesting spots and wow factor. We also looked at travel essentials, including lodging options and the ease of getting there and around. Our choices range in size from about 50,000 residents to about 225,000. They\u2019re spread across the country and serve as a reminder of what\u2019s great about the United States: communities committed to making their towns better. You\u2019ll see that spirit in revitalized neighborhoods and downtowns and in residents who have put all their passion, creativity and know-how into endeavors that feed souls and bellies. Here are our 2024 picks: 10. Duluth, Minnesota High scores: Cool lakeside setting, outdoor activities, beverage scene A small city best known over the years as an industrial, ore-shipping port on the Great Lakes, Duluth is now gaining a reputation as a refuge from the climate crisis. Its summers are typically quite temperate thanks to its setting alongside Lake Superior. The hilly city offers plenty of outdoor activities, a great beer scene, a cluster of lakeside attractions and a revitalized neighborhood showcasing handmade goods. You can join friendly Duluthians in a community sauna followed by a dip in cool Amity Creek. 9. Knoxville, Tennessee High scores: Down-to-earth vibe, live music, outdoor access You may know Knoxville as home of the University of Tennessee and its orange-and-white tsunami of fandom during sports events. Or you may know it as the host of the 1982 World\u2019s Fair and its distinctive glass tower. But did you know this eastern Tennessee city also offers a burgeoning music scene (watch out Nashville and Memphis!), delightful classic theaters and delicious eats? And there\u2019s a 1,500-acre Urban Wilderness for easy access to outdoor adventure. 8. Grand Rapids, Michigan High scores: Art and design, beer scene, outdoor activities With a world-class sculpture park and public art all over town, Grand Rapids is far more than \u201cBeer City USA.\u201d But with more than 100 breweries, distilleries and cideries, Michigan\u2019s second-largest city comes by its beverage moniker honestly. Museums showcase Grand Rapids\u2019 deep design roots, while the Grand River nods to its family-friendly outdoor assets. And a planned amphitheater along the river\u2019s banks is just part of a bigger waterfront revitalization effort. 7. Macon, Georgia High scores: Musical heritage, cultural attractions, architecture With museums and a revived studio dedicated to its musical heritage, Macon scores high on cultural attractions and the sorts of local institutions that remain beloved for generations. Macon\u2019s revitalized downtown has made way for new restaurants, bars and a boutique hotel. And with a push to turn a site holding thousands of years of history into Georgia\u2019s first US national park and preserve co-managed by the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, the city is paying attention to how its earliest history speaks to its future. 6. Flagstaff, Arizona High scores: Dark skies, outdoor activities, scenery, retro vibe Sunny days and starry nights are big draws in this high-elevation city. Enjoying lovely landscapes and the wonders of the cosmos is easy in Flagstaff, thanks to the San Francisco Peaks, numerous national monuments, the Lowell Observatory and Flagstaff\u2019s status as a Dark Sky City. Route 66 runs through here, where retro hotels cater to travelers stopping in, and downtown has seen a renaissance. The area\u2019s Native American history is another reason to visit. 5. San Luis Obispo, California High scores: Gorgeous scenery, retro vibe, outdoor activities, wineries If you\u2019re dreaming of old-school, relaxed California vibes, the super-pricey Bay Area and traffic-choked Southern California wouldn\u2019t be it. But there\u2019s a place figuratively and literally in between that\u2019s a delightful throwback to the chill, 20th-century Golden State. After all, they don\u2019t call San Luis Obispo \u201cSLO\u201d for nothin\u2019. Here, you can indulge in everything from wine trails to hiking trails without a crush of humanity. The stunning natural environment, with the Pacific nearby, is the cherry on top. 4. Portland, Maine High scores: Next-level food scene, coastal setting, outdoor access This historic harbor town offers some seriously up-to-date dining alongside classics reflecting Maine\u2019s status as the US lobster capital. The food scene here has put it squarely on the map as a culinary destination, with two new James Beard Awards just added to the city\u2019s collection. You\u2019ll also find a booming craft beer scene and tons of opportunities to get out onto the water or into the woods. Strolling the bustling center offers a window onto centuries of maritime history and a Victorian-era rebirth. 3. Tacoma, Washington High scores: Stunning setting, outdoor access, arts scene City settings don\u2019t get much better than this. Tacoma\u2019s location between Puget Sound and Mount Rainier makes for exceptional outdoor recreation in and around town. There are some pretty spectacular sights in the city, too, thanks to Dale Chihuly, the art glass master and Tacoma native.\u00a0At the Museum of Glass, exhibits and glassblowers at work in its hot shop tell the story of the medium. And flightseeing tours will give you a good look at the sacred ancestral lands of the Puyallup Tribe. 2. Providence, Rhode Island High scores: Art, architecture, design, food scene Providence\u2019s dazzling downtown riverfront exists thanks to decades of ambitious work relocating rivers and roads to beautify and preserve the city. Downtown\u2019s rivers have been dancing in the firelight of beloved art installation WaterFire for decades, and public art is everywhere. The city is also home to the renowned Rhode Island School of Design and its museum. Architecture buffs will find plenty to admire, and Providence\u2019s culinary history (with top-notch seafood and Italian cuisine) and diverse restaurants mean you\u2019ll be treated to a global feast. 1. Richmond, Virginia High scores: Cultural attractions, dining and drinks, intriguing neighborhoods Richmond, Virginia \u2013 or \u201cRVA\u201d \u2013 deserves more of the national attention enjoyed by that other capital city a couple of hours to the north. Richmond earns high scores for its top-notch museums and dynamic neighborhoods, and it\u2019s taking a hard look at its complicated history. Plus, it\u2019s got a diverse, chef-driven food scene, more than 30 breweries and ready access to surrounding wine country. And there\u2019s a nearly year-round lineup of festivals \u2014 mark your calendars for the Richmond Folk Festival in the fall.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/best-towns-america-2024-intro/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_atlantis-royal-dubai-best-luxury-resort-hnk-spc-intl", "text": "Free-flowing champagne, 24-karat gold facials, and a VVIP cabana with a suspended plunge pool: these are just some of the ultra-luxury experiences at one of the Middle East\u2019s most opulent resorts. Atlantis, The Royal, opened in Dubai last year, next to the brand\u2019s flagship resort on The Palm. Its three-day opening party \u2014 featuring performances from Beyonc\u00e9 and Swedish House Mafia \u2014 put the hotel on the map as one of the region\u2019s most iconic resorts, and nine months later it became the only hotel in the Middle East to snag a spot on the inaugural\u00a0World\u2019s 50 Best Hotels list. \u201cThe guest rooms and suites are truly setting the bar for the industry, but beyond that, there\u2019s also the collection of restaurants: it\u2019s a great location for entertainment and dining,\u201d says Tom Roelens, general manager at The Royal and managing director at Atlantis Resorts. 90 swimming pools Atlantis, The Royal, isn\u2019t a resort to do things by halves \u2014 evidenced in its 90 bathing spots, ranging from a 300-foot-long (91-meter) sky pool to private cabana plunge baths. CNN visited the hotel in March, before devastating floods hit the city in April. The resort\u2019s must-see venue is Cloud 22, the infinity pool on the 22nd floor. Its \u201cfloating\u201d sun loungers shaded by Dolce&Gabbana parasols offer sweeping views of the iconic man-made Palm islands, with cocktails and light bites (caviar bruschetta, anyone?) available at the swim-up lotus bar. There\u2019s a second lap pool overlooking the Arabian Gulf, and the deck is lined with private cabanas. But when private isn\u2019t enough, there\u2019s the VVIP duplex pool cabana; used by Kendall Jenner for the launch party of her tequila brand, the luxe pool pad has two lounge areas for entertaining and its very own glass-bottomed dipping pool, suspended from the second floor. In the resort\u2019s sky pool villas and signature suites, guests also have access to pools on their private terrace, up to 43 floors high, says Roelens. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken the concept of a resort, which typically would be horizontal, but we\u2019ve made that vertical,\u201d adds Roelens. \u201cThat really creates a very unique experience, where you have these exceptional views across The Palm and skyline of Dubai, but at the same time, you have great privacy.\u201d Pools aren\u2019t the only water feature in this hotel. The interior designers dip into the region\u2019s history, taking inspiration from the Bedouin, the nomadic people who originally inhabited the Arabian desert and navigated via water wells. The theme is neatly summarized in \u201cDroplets\u201d: a 37-foot-tall (11.3-meter) stainless-steel structure in the lobby that represents the first drop of rain in the desert. The theme of water is repeated throughout the resort, from glass elevators encased in 3,500 gallons of cascading water, to three floor-to-ceiling aquariums filled with 7,200 marine animals. Gilded glamour The hotel\u2019s 795 rooms boast designer amenities from diamond jeweler Graff, bathrobes by Italian luxury textile brand Frette, and specially designed gold toothbrushes, combs and brushes. Guests with access to the \u201cRoyal Club\u201d can take advantage of all-day champagne service, daily afternoon tea and canapes, although there\u2019s no shortage of places to eat here. The resort has 17 dining options, including \u201cthe largest collection of celebrity chef restaurants anywhere on the planet,\u201d says Roelens. And venues like Nobu Beach Club \u2014 the luxury hospitality brand\u2019s first, and currently only, beach club venue \u2014 are helping establish the resort\u2019s reputation as \u201csomewhere they want to see and be seen,\u201d adds Roelens. For a bit of rest and relaxation, its 32,300 square-foot (3,000-square-meter) spa offers not only a gold facial (this is Dubai, after all) but also a \u201cgolden hour massage\u201d \u2014 gold-dipped hot volcanic stones with gold-infused aromatherapy oil \u2014 along with therapies grounded in Arabic wellness traditions: desert sand and date sugar exfoliations, and Gulf salt and date seed scrubs. A penthouse fit for a Queen (B) For the ultra-rich, the star of the show is the Royal Mansion, an 11,840-square-foot (1,100-square-meter) four-bedroom, split-level suite \u2014 where Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z stayed when the superstar performed for the opening. Accessed via a private elevator and entrance landscaped with 100-year-old olive trees the resort \u201cadopted,\u201d the duplex offers \u201c360-degree views\u201d across the Palm and the Gulf, says Roelens. With its own infinity pool, amenities by French fashion house Herm\u00e8s, a triple-height library, a home-cinema room, and three dining spaces, guests are given a \u201cunique experience\u201d here, he says. \u201cWe have added some great touches \u2014backgammon games by (crystalware designers) Baccarat, and a Louis Vuitton ping pong table, so there are some really fun elements to that suite as well,\u201d he adds. The stunning interiors are complemented by five-star service: guests are met at the airport where their luggage is picked up by staff, and designer brands \u2014 from Graff to Valentino \u2014 are brought into the suite for a personal shopping experience. Chefs from any of the resort\u2019s restaurants, including its celebrity venues, can cook for guests in the suite\u2019s private kitchen, and 24-hour butlers and bartenders are on-call for any occasion. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s about the service: it\u2019s about our endeavor to create what our guests are looking for, whether or not they know they are looking for that,\u201d says Roelens. A taste of luxury With room rates starting from around $1,300 a night during high season \u2014 and from $100,000 for its most exclusive penthouse, one of the city\u2019s most expensive suites \u2014 the high-life comes with a hefty price tag. But there are more \u201caccessible\u201d ways to enjoy the resort, says Roelens: the Sky Blaze fountain, for example, located in the resort\u2019s expansive grounds, puts on a \u201cdramatic\u201d show every hour from 12pm daily. The fountain is overlooked by Elements Lounge, a terrace bar serving up sunset cocktails, and Estiatorio Milos by Costas Spiliadis, a Greek restaurant with extensive outdoor seating. The business lunch menu at the latter costs just 200 dirhams ($55) \u2014 not a bad price for fountain-side dining at the Middle East\u2019s \u201cbest\u201d resort.\u00a0\u00a0", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/atlantis-royal-dubai-best-luxury-resort-hnk-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "travel"}}

{"id": "2024_06_24_travel_barcelona-ending-apartment-rentals-by-foreign-tourists", "text": "Barcelona, a top Spanish holiday destination, announced on Friday that it will bar apartment rentals to tourists by 2028, an unexpectedly drastic move as it seeks to rein in soaring housing costs and make the city liveable for residents. The city\u2019s leftist mayor, Jaume Collboni, said that by November 2028,\u00a0Barcelona\u00a0will scrap the licenses of the 10,101 apartments currently approved as short-term rentals. \u201cWe are confronting what we believe is\u00a0Barcelona\u2019s largest problem,\u201d Collboni told a city government event. The boom in short-term rentals in\u00a0Barcelona, Spain\u2019s most visited city by foreign tourists, means some residents cannot afford an apartment after rents rose 68% in the past 10 years and the cost of buying a house rose by 38%, Collboni said. Access to housing has become a driver of inequality, particularly for young people, he added. National governments relish the\u00a0economic benefits\u00a0of tourism - Spain ranks among the top-three most visited countries in the world - but with local residents priced out in some places, gentrification and owner preference for lucrative tourist rentals are increasingly a hot topic across Europe. Local governments have announced\u00a0restrictions\u00a0on short-term rentals in places such as Spain\u2019s Canary Islands, Lisbon and Berlin in the past decade. Spain\u2019s Socialist housing minister, Isabel Rodriguez, said she supported\u00a0Barcelona\u2019s decision. \u201cIt\u2019s about making all the necessary efforts to guarantee access to affordable housing,\u201d she posted on X. Vacation rentals platform Airbnb, which hosts a significant number of\u00a0Barcelona\u00a0listings, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \u201cCollboni is making a mistake that will lead to (higher) poverty and unemployment,\u201d\u00a0Barcelona\u2019s tourist apartments association APARTUR said in a statement, adding the ban would trigger a rise in illegal tourist apartments. Hotels stand to benefit from the move. The opening of new hotels in the city\u2019s most popular areas was banned by a far-left party governing\u00a0Barcelona\u00a0between 2015 and 2023, but Collboni has signaled he could relax the restriction. Barcelona\u2019s hotel association declined to comment on Friday\u2019s announcement. \u201cThose 10,000 apartments will be used by the city\u2019s residents or will go on the market for rent or sale,\u201d Collboni said of the measure. Barcelona\u2019s local government said in a statement it would maintain its \u201cstrong\u201d inspection regime to detect potential illegal tourist apartments once the ban comes into force. No new tourist apartments have been allowed in the city in recent years. The local government has ordered the shutting of 9,700 illegal tourist apartments since 2016 and close to 3,500 apartments have been recovered to be used as primary housing for local residents, it said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/travel/barcelona-ending-apartment-rentals-by-foreign-tourists/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_travel_the-worlds-most-liveable-cities-for-2024", "text": "It\u2019s considered among the most beautiful cities in the world to visit, and it seems that Vienna may also be an unbeatable place to live. The Austrian city has been crowned the most liveable city in the world yet again in the annual list from the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), which was released today. The EIU, a sister organization to The Economist, ranked 173 cities across the globe on a number of significant factors, including health care, culture and environment, stability, infrastructure and education. Vienna topped the list for the third consecutive year, receiving \u201cperfect\u201d scores in four out of five of the categories \u2014 the city was marked lower for culture and environment due to an apparent lack of significant sporting events. Perfect scores Just behind the Austrian capital, Denmark\u2019s Copenhagen retained its second place position, while Switzerland\u2019s Zurich moved up from sixth place to third on the list. Australia\u2019s Melbourne fell from third to fourth place, while Canadian city Calgary tied for fifth place with Swiss city Geneva. Canada\u2019s Vancouver and Australia\u2019s Sydney were in joint seventh place, and Japan\u2019s Osaka and New Zealand\u2019s Auckland rounded out the top 10 in joint ninth place. While Western Europe performed well, with 30 cities scoring an average score of 92 out of 100, the region saw an overall decline in stability scores, which was attributed to \u201cincreasing instances of disruptive protests\u201d and crime. In 23rd place, Honolulu, Hawaii was the highest US city on the list, while Atlanta, Georgia moved up four places to number 29. Los Angeles was further down the list in 58th place, while New York came in at No. 70. \u2018Acute housing crisis\u2019 North America achieved the highest average score for education. However, marks for infrastructure were lower than the previous year in Canada due to \u201can acute housing crisis,\u201d which has affected several regions. \u201cThe situation is particularly worrying in Australia and Canada, where the availability of rental properties is at an all-time low and purchase prices have continued to rise despite interest-rate increases,\u201d reads the report. Vancouver fell backwards while remaining in the top 10, and Toronto (ninth on the list in 2023) dropped out of the top 10 to 12th place. UK capital London was ranked as the 45th most liveable city in the world. Over in Asia, Hong Kong saw the largest score improvement since last year, climbing from 61st place to 50th thanks to an improvement in its stability and health care scores. UAE cities saw some of the biggest score increases this year, with Abu Dhabi and Dubai climbing up the list, and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Riyadh, Jeddah and Al Khobar also making significant gains. Meanwhile, Israel\u2019s Tel Aviv experienced one of the biggest declines, dropping 20 places to 112th due to the Israel-Hamas war. Stability decline \u201cGlobal liveability has risen fractionally over the past year but risks to stability remain,\u201d\u00a0 said Barsali Bhattacharyya, deputy industry director at EIU. \u201cStill-high inflation accompanied by high interest rates and other economic headwinds led to another year of frequent protests across the world.\u201d There was little change at the bottom of the list, with Damascus, Syria still ranking as the least liveable in the world, with Libya\u2019s Tripoli, Algeria\u2019s Algiers and Nigeria\u2019s Lagos ranking just above. The study noted that none of the bottom four cities had seen any improvement in its overall score since 2023. \u201cSince we conducted our survey, there have been more instances of civil unrest and demonstrations around the world, such as the campus protests across the US, suggesting continuing stress on liveability that is unlikely to ease in the near future,\u201d said Bhattacharyya. 2024\u2019s Global Liveability Index: The top 10 1.

Beginning July 1, climbers must pay 2,000 yen ($12.40) per person, with a daily maximum of 4,000 climbers per day. \u201cBy strongly promoting comprehensive safety measures for climbing Mount Fuji, we will ensure that Mount Fuji, a treasure of the world, is passed on to future generations,\u201d said Koutaro Nagasaki, governor of Yamanashi Prefecture, when announcing the new regulations earlier this year. \u201cIn order to revive traditional mountain climbing from the foot of Mount Fuji, we will gain a detailed understanding of the Fuji-ko and Oshi culture that supported Mount Fuji worship. We look to link these cultures to this mountain climbing, as it is rooted in the cultural values of the religion.\u201d Fuji-ko is a religion specific to the mountain. Human traffic jams, foothills littered with garbage and inappropriately attired hikers \u2013 some attempting the ascent in sandals - are among the issues plaguing the popular Japanese site. In addition, there will be new guides who manage safety on and around the trails. They will inform climbers when they\u2019re violating etiquette on the mountain, such as sleeping by the side of the trail, starting a fire or wearing unsuitable clothing. According to prefectural data, five million people hiked Mount Fuji in 2019, a rise of three million from 2012. \u201cOvertourism \u2013 and all the subsequent consequences like rubbish, rising CO2 emissions and reckless hikers \u2013 is the biggest problem facing Mount Fuji,\u201d Masatake Izumi, a Yamanashi prefectural government official, told CNN Travel last year. In 2023, a volunteer named Tomoyo Takahashi told CNN she would ask visitors to voluntarily contribute 1,000 yen ($6.20) toward maintaining the mountain. \u201cNot everyone pays the 1,000 yen, and it makes me sad. There should be a mandatory entrance fee that\u2019s much much higher so only visitors who truly appreciate Mount Fuji\u2019s heritage come,\u201d she said at the time. Now, Takahashi will get her wish. The new rules, though, only apply in Yamanashi prefecture, which is where the more popular hiking trails are. Fuji is also located in Shizuoka prefecture, which has not yet implemented any taxes or visitor limits. Governor Nagasaki told reporters that he and the governor of Shizuoka would meet at the end of the climbing season to compare notes. Japan\u2019s tourism headaches Overtourism has become a bigger issue in Japan since the country reopened following the pandemic. In Kyoto, locals in the historic Gion quarter have expressed their concern with tourists who flock there to photograph and sometimes harass the geisha who live and work there, earning the nickname \u201cgeisha paparazzi.\u201d While the city has put up signs and placards asking visitors not to photograph geisha, some locals told CNN Travel that it wasn\u2019t enough. One suggestion offered by the neighborhood council is issuing fines or tickets. And the town of Hatsukaichi, in Hiroshima prefecture in southwestern Japan, has been affected too. The small town is home to the famous orange \u201cfloating shrine\u201d torii gate, which is part of a 1,400-year-old Shinto complex. In October 2023, the town began charging 100 yen (62 cents) per visitor to the shrine. The money from the \u201ctourist tax\u201d goes toward maintaining the site and its infrastructure.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/mount-fuji-japan-visitor-cap-tourist-tax-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "travel"}}

Ceely, a therapist in California who specializes in working with men, believed it was a form of digital detox and meditation. But a growing contingent of young men on the internet are doing the same practice but branding it in a very different way: it\u2019s called \u201craw dogging.\u201d \u201cI was tired of the usual routine of watching a movie or reading a book (onboard) so I said, \u2018I\u2019m just going to kind of stare off into space, and use it is a Zen meditation.\u2019\u201d Ceely says of his experience chilling out on a plane. He says that it can be difficult to get some men to embrace meditation, mindfulness, or anything else that could be considered \u201cspiritual.\u201d While he tells CNN he\u2019s not familiar with the term \u201craw dogging\u201d being used in this particular way, he can see why the eyebrow-raising moniker appeals to a certain kind of traveler. \u201cMen do like challenges,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely more socially acceptable for men to brag about something like this. Also I think it might be more of a male psyche kind of thing: I like a challenge, let me see if I can get through this. It\u2019s an acetic practice, but branding it with bro-speak.\u201d Some men have taken the challenge beyond just eschewing in-flight entertainment, skipping on-board food and drink or even getting up to go to the bathroom. The trend has been popular on social media, with TikTok users one-upping each other for who has gone the longest stretch with the fewest amenities. A British DJ with the handle oiwudini got 1.3 million likes on a video where he bragged about traveling on a seven-hour flight without headphones, sleep or other creature comforts. One commenter called the experience \u201can incredible dopamine detox.\u201d Some women are getting in on the experience too. TikTokker Veronica Skaia said that it\u2019s her preferred form of traveling. \u201cI just stare into the abyss and watch the little GPS plane,\u201d she said in a video that got 9,905 comments. In GQ, reporter Kate Lindsay traces one origin of the unfortunately named trend to the Apple TV show Hijack, where the character played by Idris Elba is on a plane without his phone or any devices. However, on the show Elba\u2019s character doesn\u2019t have much time to stare off into space, as he\u2019s busy trying to negotiate with a group of terrorists who have hijacked the plane he\u2019s on.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/travel/raw-dogging-travel-trend-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "travel"}}

If, however, we absolutely must, the way to make that experience the best it can possibly be is to fly with Qatar Airways. At least that\u2019s the verdict from this year\u2019s Skytrax Awards, which were announced Monday. For the eighth time in the 25-year history of the prestigious awards \u2013 known as the Oscars of commercial aviation \u2013 Qatar was named the World\u2019s Best Airline, in recognition of the quality of service it offers passengers on its modern fleet. \u201cThis is a remarkable achievement for Qatar Airways to win this World\u2019s Best Airline title for 2024, the eighth time they have triumphed,\u201d Skytrax CEO Edward Plaisted said in a statement to mark the award ceremony, which gathered airline execs and cabin crew in a manor house near London\u2019s Heathrow Airport. \u201cWe congratulate Qatar Airways on this success which should be a source of great pride and satisfaction for the airline management and staff.\u201d The Middle Eastern carrier has built a strong reputation over the past decade, helping Qatar\u2019s award-winning Hamad International Airport establish itself as a global aviation hub to challenge regional rivals Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Qatar\u2019s fleet of 230 airplanes ranges from its 10 much-loved A380 superjumbos, to Boeing 777-300ERs, Boeing 787-8s and 787-9s, Airbus A350-900s and A350-1000s, plus a range of smaller capacity jets. \u201cThis is a proud Qatar Airways moment and it is my honor to share this award with my hard working colleagues,\u201d the airline\u2019s CEO Badr Mohammed Al-Meer said in a statement released by Skytrax. \u201cThis award is testimony to our relentless dedication to providing unparalleled service and innovation. We look forward to more wins in the future.\u201d Close-run contest Qatar\u2019s victory meant second place for last year\u2019s winner, Singapore Airlines, but only just. UK-based Skytrax said the votes, gathered from surveys of more than 21 million customers from 100 countries about 350 airlines, were the closest run since the awards began in 1999, requiring a recount. The rest of the top 10 was, once again, devoid of North American airlines, with Dubai\u2019s Emirates airline in third, Japan\u2019s ANA All Nippon Airways in fourth, Hong Kong\u2019s Cathay Pacific in fifth, Japan Airlines in sixth, Turkish Airlines is seventh, Taiwan\u2019s EVA Air in eighth, Air France in ninth and Swiss International Airlines in 10th. There were plenty of consolation prizes. Five-time winner Singapore picked up the prize for World\u2019s Best Cabin Staff \u2013 an achievement senior VP, Tan Pee Teck, put down to the \u201cunwavering dedication and professionalism\u201d of its in-air teams. Singapore also won for Best First Class service and Best Airline in Asia. ANA, meanwhile, picked up the accolade for World\u2019s Best Airport Services, as well as Best Airline Staff Service in Asia. Saudia was named World\u2019s Most Improved Airline, beating Taiwan\u2019s Starlux and Iceland\u2019s Play into second and third places. At the budget end of flying, AirAsia was once again crowned the World\u2019s Best Low-Cost Airline \u2013 repeating an achievement it has made every year since 2010. Singapore\u2019s Scoot was named the World\u2019s Best Long Haul-Low Cost Airline. AirAsia boss Tony Fernandes said his airline\u2019s unwavering success was thanks to the work of its \u201cAllstars\u201d cabin crew coupled with strong brand loyalty. \u201cNo other companies come to my mind in achieving such a winning streak, and we are very proud of it,\u201d he said in a statement.\u00a0 We dedicate this award to all of our Allstars who work tirelessly to make today happen, and also to everyone who has remained loyal to us through the ups and downs AirAsia has experienced.\u201d Still in Asia, Bangkok Airways picked up the World\u2019s Best Regional Airline prize for the eighth consecutive year, while Vistara was named best India/South Asian carrier and Fiji Airways was Best Airline in the Australia/Pacific region. Ethiopian Airlines was named Africa\u2019s best, for the sixth year in a row. Turkish Airlines was Europe\u2019s best, airBaltic was Eastern Europe\u2019s winner and Hainan Airlines was best in China. Delta Air Lines was declared the Best Airline in North America, also picking up the award for Best Airline Staff Service for the region.

{"id": "travel_married-southwest-pilots", "text": "On their first flight together, Joel Atkinson and Shelley Atkinson couldn\u2019t contain their excitement. They enthused to the flight attendants. They posed for photos. They told passengers via a pre-flight announcement. \u201cWe made a big deal about it,\u201d Joel tells CNN Travel. Then, right before take off, Joel and Shelley sat side by side in the flight deck, just the two of them. They\u2019d come full circle, and were about to embark on an exciting new chapter. \u201cIt felt amazing,\u201d Shelley tells CNN Travel. \u201cAs we prepared to take off, I was giddy, euphoric,\u201d says Joel. Joel and Shelley met as twentysomethings flying jets in the US Air Force. They became fast friends, then, over time, fell in love. Today, they\u2019ve been married for 27 years and counting. They\u2019ve brought up two kids together. And now they\u2019re both pilots for Southwest Airlines. They regularly fly together, with Joel as captain and Shelley as first officer. The couple say working together is \u201camazing.\u201d They treat layovers as \u201cdate nights.\u201d They learn from one another\u2019s respective \u201cwisdom and judgment.\u201d And no, they don\u2019t argue mid-flight. \u201cPeople ask us, how does it work, flying together?\u201d says Joel. \u201cWe know a few pilot couples and some of them fly together, some of them don\u2019t. I\u2019ve heard people say, \u2018Oh I could never fly with my wife or my husband.\u2019\u201d For Joel and Shelley, working together is seamless \u2013 a joy that comes easily to them both. \u201cWe\u2019re best friends,\u201d says Shelley. \u201cThere\u2019s just that unspoken bond,\u201d says Joel. Inspired by \u2018Top Gun\u2019 Shelley grew up in Iowa and moved to Colorado \u2013 Joel\u2019s home state \u2013 as a teenager. The two spent their high school years unaware of one another, but they graduated the same year, and both opted to study at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado in the late 1980s. Joel says he was very influenced by the 1985 Tom Cruise movie \u201cTop Gun\u201d \u2013 \u201cwhich made flying jets look like a lot of fun.\u201d For Shelley, who was an athlete, the appeal of the Air Force Academy was less about flying \u2013 which she only really discovered once she was enrolled \u2013 and more an opportunity to play college basketball. \u201cI didn\u2019t attend the Academy to pursue flying, initially. Once I was there I realized it was a great opportunity for a fun and challenging career,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the introduction to flying there made me want to pursue it further.\u201d Joel and Shelley spent four years studying at the Air Force Academy without actually crossing paths, although Joel was vaguely aware of Shelley. \u201cThere\u2019s not that many women at the Air Force Academy, so I kind of knew who she was,\u201d he says. The two finally met a few years later, after they\u2019d both completed pilot training in different states. They got the same first assignment \u2013 flying Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft in Texas. When Shelley arrived in Texas, Joel had been there for a few months. \u201cSo I was there, kind of established, and she came into the office where I was working,\u201d he recalls. \u201cShe came in and turned in the paperwork, and we said, \u2018Hi,\u2019 just exchanged some pleasantries.\u201d Joel was struck by Shelley right away. \u201cShe\u2019s tall. She looks great. She left the room and this other coworker was just looking at me smiling. And I said, \u2018What?\u2019 And he could tell.\u201d Looking back, Joel thinks it was the \u201ceye contact\u201d he had with Shelley that gave his feelings away. Or maybe just \u201cthe look on my face.\u201d \u201cThere was something there,\u201d says Joel, smiling. \u201cBut I just kind of laughed it off. I was like, \u2018Nah, we\u2019re just going to be friends.\u2019\u201d Joel was also a bit intimidated by Shelley \u2013 he was \u201cattracted to her right away,\u201d but didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d ever be interested in him. \u201cShe\u2019s taller than me. And I had never dated anyone taller than me,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s an athlete, she\u2019s a natural leader, and just an impressive person.\u201d But Joel\u2019s warm nature appealed to Shelley. She felt comfortable around him right away. They became close friends. \u201cJoel has a really great sense of humor,\u201d says Shelley. \u201cI love that about him. And he just really has a sensitive heart to people, all people around him, he looks out for people.\u201d \u201cThat really attracted me to him. And also, he used to have a nice dark head of hair. I really liked that too. But he has a very distinguished look now, and he\u2019s just as handsome as ever.\u201d About a year after they first met, Joel and Shelley were deployed abroad, together. That\u2019s when they \u201ckind of started dating,\u201d as Joel puts it. While there wasn\u2019t much opportunity to go on actual dates on active service, they bonded. \u201cConversations, talking about everything, basically,\u201d says Shelley. \u201cWe really got to know each other\u2019s heart that way. And I think it just made it clear that this is what we were supposed to do.\u201d Back home in the US, the two \u201cstarted officially dating.\u201d \u201cWe just kind of knew that this was going to be it,\u201d says Joel. \u201cAnd within a few months, we got married.\u201d Joel and Shelley became instructor Air Force pilots in Mississippi. Then, in the early 2000s, Shelley gave birth to the couple\u2019s kids, two twins, a boy and a girl. Shelley left flying around this time, but she stayed in the military, working for the US Air National Guard. \u201cI wanted to be at home,\u201d says Shelley. The path to pregnancy wasn\u2019t easy for the couple and Joel calls their kids a \u201chuge blessing.\u201d \u201cWe went through in vitro a couple of times,\u201d he says. \u201cIt took a few years for us to actually get pregnant.\u201d The family relocated back to Colorado and Joel transitioned from military flying to commercial flying, becoming a pilot with Southwest Airlines in 2006. Returning to the air Cut to 2021. The pandemic years were tough going for Joel and Shelley, emotionally speaking. While the couple stayed healthy, their kids were in their late teens and struggled with the upheaval. Plus, Covid was impacting the aviation industry, so Joel was flying less. Around this time, Shelley left her job at the National Guard. She and Joel were wholly focused on their family and their kids\u2019 wellbeing. But in time, the pandemic waned and Joel started flying more regularly. Joel and Shelley\u2019s kids graduated high school and started the next phase of their lives. It was a transitional period for the Atkinson family, and in turn, Shelley started considering her future. She found herself dreaming about flying. She hadn\u2019t been behind the controls of a plane in over two decades, but she felt a call to return. She started wondering if, like Joel, she could become a commercial pilot. When Shelley voiced the idea to Joel, he was immediately enthusiastic. \u201cI said, \u2018Come fly with me,\u2019\u201d says Joel, joking \u201ccue the music.\u201d Then, by coincidence, later that day, Joel saw a social media post from his airline, Southwest, about a pilot who\u2019d taken a two decade break to raise a family, then returned to flying. \u201cShe literally had the same story as me,\u201d says Shelley. It felt like a sign. While Joel didn\u2019t know this other pilot directly, he was able to reach out to her via his work network and pass on contact details to Shelley, who subsequently texted the other pilot, asking for guidance and advice. Then, with encouragement from her new friend \u2013 plus Joel\u2019s wholehearted support \u2013 Shelley committed to returning to the skies full time. While Shelley had years of Air Force experience, she hadn\u2019t flown airplanes for 20 years. She had had to hit the books, take additional tests and ensure her qualifications were up to speed. But before long Shelley was hired by SkyWest Airlines, flying regional jets. Then she joined Joel at Southwest in 2023. \u201cIt was crazy. It happened way faster than I thought it would. It\u2019s been amazing,\u201d says Shelley. \u201cIt was meant to be,\u201d says Joel. Flying together Joel and Shelley credit their success as a co-pilot team to their nearly three decades of marriage, as well as years of co-parenting. \u201cRaising two teenagers during Covid, I tell people that was a lot harder than what we\u2019re doing now,\u201d says Joel. Plus, the two met as colleagues \u2013 so they know how to balance commitment to a job with enjoying each other\u2019s company. Still, as a married couple in the military, Joel and Shelley never flew in the same aircraft. \u201cThe military kind of frowns upon it,\u201d says Joel. \u201cIt\u2019s a little morbid, but they don\u2019t want you to both go down in a plane crash.\u201d No such guidelines exist in commercial aviation, and so once Shelley joined Southwest, she and Joel were able to work side by side. Joel\u2019s seniority allows him to regularly bid for flights with Shelley. And the two find Joel\u2019s years of commercial aviation experience pairs well with Shelley\u2019s fresh take. \u201cShe looks to me and relies on me for the experience that I have. But I also know that she is a very sharp person, she just went through a lot of training. So her knowledge is fresh. And she also has that wisdom and judgment,\u201d says Joel. Since the excitement of their first flight, Joel and Shelley tend not to \u201cmake a big deal\u201d about being a husband and wife pilot duo \u2013 unless it\u2019s preempted by their colleagues. \u201cWe wait for them to ask,\u201d says Shelley. As the couple share the same last name, often crew members put two and two together. As Joel\u2019s the more senior of the two, he often runs the pre-flight briefing. Sometimes he\u2019ll end it with a quick, throwaway: \u201cYes, we\u2019re married.\u201d The crew usually \u201cstart laughing,\u201d says Joel. When Joel and Shelley are taking off and landing, they\u2019re focused on the job at hand. \u201cIt\u2019s very technical,\u201d says Joel. \u201cWe\u2019re running checklists.\u201d But when the airplane reaches cruising altitude, \u201cthere\u2019s some downtime\u201d and Joel and Shelley will make the most of it, talking through their thoughts on life, their kids, their future plans and everything else that\u2019s on their mind. \u201cIt\u2019s so great, because all the years that I was flying, and she was at home, anything I wanted to talk to her about when I\u2019m up in the air, it had to wait,\u201d says Joel. \u201cYou\u2019re saving up conversations until you\u2019re home. It\u2019s like now we\u2019re making up for lost time.\u201d Then, when they land, Joel and Shelley make the most of the layovers. Southwest largely flies domestically, so the couple enjoy traveling the length and breadth of the US together. \u201cIt is a great job, because you go see different places and spend time in different cities,\u201d says Joel, but before Shelley joined Southwest, Joel says layovers sometimes felt like \u201cwasted time, because it was just me, and I couldn\u2019t share it with her.\u201d \u201cBut now we\u2019re together when we\u2019re on the road \u2013 it\u2019s so fun. Because every night on the road, it\u2019s a date night together,\u201d he says. Now, instead of counting the days until he\u2019s home, Joel says his \u201chome is right here\u201d because \u201cshe\u2019s with me.\u201d Family connection While Joel and Shelley have flown together countless times since Shelley joined Southwest, they\u2019ve yet to fly with their kids in tow. That\u2019s on the to-do list \u2013 plus, their son is also training to be a pilot, so there\u2019s a chance Shelley and Joel might pilot an aircraft with him in the future. For Shelley, an additional perk of the last couple of years is her adult kids getting to \u201cview her as a pilot for the first time.\u201d Shelley and Joel\u2019s children grew up knowing their parents met flying jets \u2013 but\u00a0while they saw their father regularly piloting airplanes for Southwest, they never saw Shelley flying. Shelley is really happy her children get to see her doing a job she loves. Shelley\u2019s also proud to be a female pilot in an industry that\u2019s still very male-dominated. She hopes to inspire other people, especially mothers who may have taken a break from the workplace to raise a family, by demonstrating that returning to a passion is possible. \u201cI hope it encourages other women that there is this opportunity out there \u2013 you can come back and you can still do it,\u201d she says. Shelley says she\u2019s really loved rediscovering her love of flying. \u201cThe view from 36,000 feet is pretty awesome,\u201d she says. \u201cFlying over parts of the country - I just love looking down and going, \u2018Oh, what town is that?\u2019\u201d Shelley and Joel particularly enjoy flying in and out of San Diego, California, but they also love it when Southwest takes them to New York. Before Christmas, they enjoyed a stopover in New York City and went searching for the settings of their favorite movies, from \u201cElf\u201d to \u201cSerendipity.\u201d \u201cI love traveling, seeing new places,\u201d says Joel, who adds that he\u2019s gone from avoiding working weekends to voluntarily signing up for Saturday and Sunday flight shifts. He and Shelley now spend Saturday nights watching jazz in Portland, going on hikes in Sacramento or drinking cocktails in Palm Springs. Joel\u2019s always loved flying \u2013 especially what he calls \u201cthe art and science\u201d of aviation. He also loves \u201cserving people, getting them to where they need to be,\u201d but he admits flying during the pandemic was hard going. For Joel, having Shelley now by his side at work has \u201cbeen just a complete turnaround.\u201d Now even the ride to work is fun as the couple car share, coffees in hand. Joel and Shelley, who post about their adventures on their Instagram account @luvpilots, are currently planning to pick up a flight together on Valentine\u2019s Day. Joel bought the two of them heart-printed ties especially \u2013 they\u2019re \u201csilly, but fun,\u201d says Joel. The couple enjoy chronicling their travels on social media \u2013 celebrating their marriage, their respective careers and their adventures. \u201cWe feel blessed. We\u2019re thankful for the opportunity,\u201d says Joel. \u201cWe\u2019re thankful to Southwest Airlines for letting us do this together.\u201d \u201cIf you love doing something, why not do it with the person you love?\u201d says Shelley.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/married-southwest-pilots/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_worlds-50-best-restaurants-for-2024", "text": "Any doubts that Spain remains the fine dining center of the world may just have evaporated with the revealing of the World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants for 2024 list. Five eateries from the European nation made the list \u2013 three of them in the top five. The awards\u00a0\u2013 considered the Oscars of global fine dining \u2013 were handed out at a ceremony at the Wynn in Las Vegas on Wednesday evening, with Barcelona\u2019s Disfrutar walking away with the top prize. Ranked number two last year, it\u2019s owned and run by chefs Oriol Castro, Eduard Xatruch and Mateu Casanas. The fact that this trio met while working at the legendary El Bulli should provide a few clues as to what diners can expect \u2013 imaginative and playful dishes executed with technical mastery, such as the caviar-filled Panchino doughnut, the frozen gazpacho sandwich and squab with kombu spaghetti, almond and grape. Coming in at number two was Asador Etxebarri of Atxondo, not far from the Spanish port city of Bilbao. Under the leadership of chef Victor Arguinzoniz, it\u2019s famed for offering unbeatable barbecue that lets the quality of the ingredients shine, such as a red Palam\u00f3s prawn that\u2019s simply grilled and served on its own. But you can never count Paris out.\u00a0The French capital\u2019s Table by Bruno Verjus\u00a0squeezed into third place, while yet another restaurant from Spain \u2013 Madrid\u2019s Diverxo \u2013 took the fourth spot. Coming in at fifth was Lima\u2019s Maido, one of three restaurants from the city to make the list, giving the Peruvian capital\u2019s reputation as South America\u2019s premier dining destination yet another boost. Mexico was the big winner in North America, earning three restaurants on the list, led by Mexico City eatery Quintonil, which came in seventh. The rest of the list Securing five restaurants on the list was enough to make Spain the biggest winner of the night in Vegas. In terms of cities, Paris and Bangkok tied for first, each with four restaurants on the list. Gaggan Anand, at number nine, was the Thai capital\u2019s top entry. As for the event\u2019s host country, the US had two restaurants on this year\u2019s 50 Best list. New York City\u2019s Atomix came in 6th this year, rising two spots since last year. SingleThread, in the town of Healdsburg in California\u2019s Sonoma Valley, landed in 46th place. Three restaurants from Tokyo were awarded, with eatery S\u00e9zanne\u00a0(voted Asia\u2019s best restaurant in 2024) ranking the highest in the Japanese capital, at 15. Hong Kong saw two of its restaurants hit the list, with both making impressive moves. Wing was the city\u2019s highest new entry on the entire list, at 20, while The Chairman was the highest climber, moving from last year\u2019s 50th spot into number 26. The list is compiled based on the votes of the\u00a0The World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants Academy, which is made up of\u00a0 1,080 international restaurant industry experts including food writers and chefs, in 27 regions around the world. Restaurants can only win the top prize once, after which they\u2019re entered into a separate \u201cBest of the Best\u201d program. Members of that elite group include Geranium and Noma in Copenhagen, as well as New York\u2019s Eleven Madison Park, The Fat Duck near London, Osteria Francescana in Modena, Italy, and Mirazur in Menton, France. Last year\u2019s winner, Central of Lima, Peru, now joins them on that list. The world\u2019s 50 best restaurants 2024 1. Disfrutar\u00a0(Barcelona, Spain) 2.

{"id": "2015_07_20_travel_shark-attack-how-to-survive", "text": "First things first. Despite some truly terrifying tales of survival, you are incredibly unlikely to be duking it out with a shark any time soon. But sharks do occasionally attack humans \u2013 and they certainly make news when they do: \u2022 A 14-year-old boy was bitten in the leg by a shark at a\u00a0North Carolina beach\u00a0in late June 2024. \u2022 A lifeguard and surf instructor, who also appeared in \u201cPirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,\u201d after an apparent\u00a0shark\u00a0attack on the North Shore of Oahu, Hawaii, in late June 2024. \u2022 Florida fire officials asked beachgoers to exercise caution in early June 2024 after three people were injured in two separate shark attacks within just 90 minutes of each other at neighboring Walton County beaches. \u2022 A Russian citizen was killed by a shark in the Red Sea in Egypt on June 2023. While these kinds of encounters understandably cause would-be ocean swimmers to worry, there\u2019s no need to panic about your upcoming beach vacation. The chances of being attacked by a shark are extremely low despite the headlines. The Florida Museum of Natural History\u2019s International Shark Attack File found just 69 confirmed, unprovoked shark attacks on people and 36 confirmed bites worldwide in 2023. That compares with 57 confirmed, unprovoked shark bites on people and 32 bites in 2022. Think about it a minute \u2013 the world population is more than 8 billion people. Many of those live near or vacation at the coast. And that\u2019s all the shark attacks recorded. Your chances of drowning are much, much higher. In 2023, the United States once again led the way in unprovoked attacks in 2023 at 36; Florida had the highest state total at 16. That said, you can take steps to increase your chances of survival during a highly improbable attack, according to shark experts interviewed by CNN Travel. Before you get in the water Know your environment Sharks are salt-water creatures. The ocean is their home; we are the visitors. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to the ocean, you have to assume you could encounter a shark regardless of when or where that is,\u201d said Neil Hammerschlag, director of the Shark Research and Conservation Program at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School.  \u201cFortunately, humans aren\u2019t on the menu, and also fortunately, sharks tend to avoid people.\u201d Still, there are places you\u2019re more likely to encounter a shark.  River mouths are not the best place to swim You should avoid estuaries, said Richard Peirce, an author, shark expert and former chair of the UK-based Shark Trust and Shark Conservation Society.  Their often-murky waters are a favorite with bull sharks, which are the most likely to attack humans along with great whites and tiger sharks. \u201cAn awful lot of attacks occur in river mouths, where there is silt and other material in suspension in the river \u2013 people washing their clothes, people washing themselves,\u201d said Peirce. Hammerschlag pointed out another area where an encounter is more likely: deeper channels between the shoreline and sandbars farther out. Avoid areas with fishing Before you jump in the sea, have a look around the horizon: What do you see? If you see fishing boats, Peirce says \u201cforget it.\u201d \u201cWhether the fishing activity is commercial or recreational, material will often be being discarded, and unwanted dead fish, fish parts and the action of gutting fish are all putting chum in the water and inviting attention from sharks,\u201d he said.   Before you go in, watch for unusual fish activity, such as a whole bunch of small- and medium-sized fish jumping out of the water, Hammerschlag said. That\u2019s a possible sign a shark might be nearby. He also advised to not swim within roughly 50 yards of where someone is fishing from shore. Avoid dusk and dawn Swimming early in the morning or late at night can be lovely, but it\u2019s also the time when a shark attack is most likely. \u201cA lot of shark attacks are cases of mistaken identity,\u201d Peirce says, \u201cdue to reduced visibility and identification ability on the behalf of the shark.\u201d Hang with lifeguards Chris Lowe, professor in marine biology and director of the Shark Lab at California State University, Long Beach, advises to \u201cdo your homework\u201d before you go into unfamiliar waters. Bone up a little bit on species you might encounter in different places. If you have any questions, ask a local lifeguard. He said they are a great resource.  \u201cI always recommend people go to guarded beaches. It\u2019s a lot safer,\u201d he said. Don\u2019t wear shiny objects in the water \u201cBe careful with jewelry, anything that flashes because sharks are always looking for fish.\u201d Lowe said. In murky water, a shark may think that flash is a sign of a meal. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t want your hand or foot to get confused with that.\u201d Follow your instincts \u201cProbably the most important thing is to follow your gut,\u201d Hammerschlag said. \u201cIf you feel wary about getting in the water \u2026 just don\u2019t go in the water.\u201d \u201cA lot of people who have been bitten actually said they had a weird sensation before that, like they had an inner voice telling them to get out of the water and they didn\u2019t listen to it,\u201d he said. If a shark is nearby Don\u2019t panic So you\u2019re being circled by a shark. The worst thing you can do right now is panic. \u201cDon\u2019t start splashing around \u2013 you\u2019re just going to excite, incite and encourage the shark\u2019s interest,\u201d said Peirce. Humans, apes, dogs and cats all have paws and hands. If we want to explore something we pick it up and we touch it, we feel it, we put it to our nose. \u201cA shark has got no paws or hands, so if it wants to explore something, the only capability it\u2019s got to do that is to put it in its mouth,\u201d said Peirce.  \u201cThat\u2019s why we often get exploratory bites which don\u2019t result in death and sometimes don\u2019t even result in serious injury. If you go swimming and splashing away, you\u2019re almost inviting the shark to come give you an exploratory or an attack bite.\u201d Maintain eye contact As the shark swims around you, keep your head on a swivel and try to maintain eye contact. \u201cSharks are ambush predators,\u201d Peirce explained. \u201cIf you\u2019re turning around and facing it the whole time while it circles you, it\u2019s not going to be half as comfortable as if it\u2019s able to sneak up from behind.\u201d Hammerschlag concurred, saying you should posture your body toward the shark so it knows you see it and you\u2019re following it. Then slowly back up toward your exit to a boat or shore. If you\u2019re surfing, track the shark with your board, Lowe said. \u201cLet the shark know it\u2019s being watched.\u201d Marine biologists and shark divers Adriana Fragola and Kayleigh Grant show how that eye contact method works with tiger sharks. In a viral TikTok video (see top of story), the shark is seen as Fragola splashes away, capturing its attention. She turns around, faces the approaching shark, remains still in the water and gently deflects the shark away with her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re definitely never going to outswim or outrun a shark if it were actually chasing you,\u201d Fragola says in the video. Stay big or get small This is where it gets complicated. If a shark is clearly in attack mode, you need to make yourself as big as possible in the water, according to Peirce.  \u201cThe bigger you are in the water, the more respect you\u2019ll get,\u201d he said. But if the shark seems to simply be passing through, Peirce\u2019s advice is to roll up into a ball. \u201cIf a shark sees you as a competitor for its food source, that can be one reason it attacks you,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t want to be seen by a great white shark as a competitor \u2013 and if it wasn\u2019t showing massive interest in me \u2013 I would actually curl up so he shows even less interest in me.\u201d If you\u2019re being attacked Don\u2019t play dead This isn\u2019t a bear, it\u2019s a shark. If you find yourself in an aggressive encounter, give it hell: punch, kick and poke at sensitive spots \u2013 but be careful where you aim. \u201cThere\u2019s all this talk about punching a shark in the nose. That\u2019s OK, but remember that just underneath the nose is a mouth,\u201d said Peirce.  \u201cThis is a moving object in the water and you\u2019re not staying still either, so what you don\u2019t want to do is end up effectively punching at the mouth or anywhere near it.\u201d A good shot to the gills can also do the job: \u201cThe gills are very sensitive \u2013 giving a shark a whack in the gills isn\u2019t a bad idea.\u201d Are you carrying anything with you? If so, turn it into a weapon.  \u201cIf you\u2019re a diver with an underwater camera, use it, if you\u2019re a snorkeler, rip off your snorkel and use it to poke the shark,\u201d Peirce says. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of sharks come at me, and it\u2019s (been) enough to use a shark billy \u2013 a small metal rod between two and three feet long \u2013 and I\u2019ve just given them a little nudge on their nose.\u201d It\u2019s a good idea to swim with other people, Lowe said. Not only does that decrease the chances of an attack, he said, but you\u2019ve got someone to assist you to a boat or shore if you are bitten. Cut off the angles If you\u2019re a diver and you run into trouble, try to get into a position where the shark can\u2019t get behind you, says Peirce. \u201cKeep your back to something like a coral reef. Then you\u2019ve only got one direction to look. You\u2019re protected from behind, for example, and that enables you to keep the shark in sight in front of you and maybe swim to the top of the reef slowly to where your boat is.\u201d Slowly back away Displace the least amount of water possible. Try not to thrash and splash around as you gradually swim backwards toward shore. \u201cYou must try and keep the animal in sight and very slowly and gently try and swim backwards and get into shallow water. Again, you\u2019ve got to be careful \u2013 large sharks can attack in very shallow depths.\u201d Doing the above may help to a degree, but Peirce says the likelihood of escaping without injury when a big shark attacks is slim. \u201cIf a white shark is in full attack mode, there\u2019s not much you\u2019re going to be able to do at that point,\u201d he says.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2015/07/20/travel/shark-attack-how-to-survive/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_travel_star-wars-hotel-disney-jenny-nicholson-cec", "text": "In 2023, Disney closed a highly-publicized luxury hotel on the Walt Disney World property called \u201cStar Wars: Galactic Starcruiser.\u201d For Disney superfans, it was a time of high drama and schadenfreude as promises about the hotel\u2019s immersive world ran aground on the rocky reality of some guests\u2019 experiences. Now, a year later, a four-hour-long YouTube deep-dive has resurfaced details about the concept and spread the niche piece of Disney lore to millions of viewers. The creator of the video, YouTuber Jenny Nicholson, is known for her commentary on various corners of fan culture. Some of her most popular videos cover shows and movies like \u201cThe Vampire Diaries,\u201d \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d and installments in the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise. None of them are nearly as long as her most recent video, \u201cThe Spectacular Failure of the Star Wars Hotel.\u201d Over the course of 20 video chapters, Nicholson details her 2022 stay at the \u201cStar Wars: Galactic Starcruiser\u201d hotel in Orlando, Florida. The tale is likely familiar to Disney and Star Wars fans, many of whom heard about the high-dollar, high-concept hotel and its closure in 2023. Nicholson says she paid more than $6,000 for a two-night stay in the hotel, which was supposed to resemble a Star Wars-style spaceship called the Halcyon. The big draw of the hotel lay in what Disney marketing called an \u201cimmersive, customizable Star Wars experience\u201d that Nicholson equated to LARPing, or live-action roleplaying. Guests were encouraged to dress up, and through a combination of live experiences with cast members and choices made in a special app, were guided through a three-day-long Star Wars storyline complete with full itinerary and, if played to its full extent, very little downtime. With Disney-esque details like working lightsabers and colorful themed food, the experience was supposed to feel like a \u201clandlocked cruise,\u201d with all of the entertainment happening onboard the ship \u2014 in reality, a large ultra-secure windowless building near Walt Disney World\u2019s Epcot resort area. Nicholson\u2019s experience squared with some more critical reviews of the hotel: Cramped rooms, inconsistent experiences with technology and a general sense of confusion as to the purpose or audience of the venture. (She also mentioned, at length, some of the things she enjoyed, like cast member performances and details in the ship-hotel\u2019s interior.) Little of this is new information. Disney announced the closing of the Galactic Starcruiser in May 2023, and the hotel served its last guests last September. In a press release provided to CNN from that time, Disney said the project \u201cgave us the opportunity to try new things.\u201d \u201cStar Wars: Galactic Starcruiser is one of our most creative projects ever and has been praised by our guests and recognized for setting a new bar for innovation and immersive entertainment,\u201d the statement read. \u201c\u2026 we will take what we\u2019ve learned to create future experiences that can reach more of our guests and fans.\u201d Still, Nicholson\u2019s video netted more than 2 million views in two days, and has already wormed its way into the social media pipeline of memes and references. Some X users marveled at the fact that they willingly watched a double feature-length video about, as one user said, something they \u201cpreviously never gave a s*** about in my life.\u201d Why yesterday\u2019s drama draws today\u2019s audience Longform videos are an increasingly popular form of YouTube entertainment, and it isn\u2019t unusual to see older topics being reexamined in multi-hour \u201cdeep dives.\u201d Nicholson\u2019s video also combines several winning formulas into one: Disney, Star Wars, insider information (Nicholson includes pictures and videos from her time in the hotel) and, of course, failures. \u201cI couldn\u2019t care less about some dumb Star Wars hotel, but give me those 4 hours,\u201d one X user said. Consumer research from Google claims that longform videos are gaining traction among younger viewers and, interestingly, are even more successful when they cover \u201cfan culture\u201d content. \u201cThere is a healthy appetite for more in-depth exploration of topics such as film, TV, and sports,\u201d a 2022 Google consumer insights report reads. \u201cThese allow for fan-centric creators to share thoughts and ideas at length with an increasingly captive audience: 61% of Gen Z would describe themselves as a \u201creally big\u201d or \u201csuper fan\u201d of someone or something.\u201d Both Star Wars and Disney enjoy particularly loyal fandoms with elephant memories and no qualms about engaging the same topics over and over again. Even the tiniest details in a Star Wars movie or a Disney theme park have cult followings, backstories, fan lore and, of course, their own video deep dives. A spotlight on Disney\u2019s future Nicholson\u2019s video, while not exactly breaking news, drops as Disney prepares a new slate of innovations. Earlier this year, Disney announced a massive 10-year, $60 billion expansion program for its parks, cruises and experiences worldwide. That includes a planned 14-acre expansion at the Magic Kingdom in Orlando\u2019s Walt Disney World and an expansion of the original Disneyland in Anaheim. The company recently got final approval from Anaheim\u2019s city council to move forward with DisneylandForward, a nearly $2 billion investment in the Disneyland resort and surrounding areas. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to build on decades of innovation, creativity, and storytelling to bring new, exciting experiences for our guests,\u201d Disneyland Resort President Ken Potrock wrote in a blog post announcing the approval of the project. In April, Disney CEO Bob Iger said expansion plans for Walt Disney World are on track after the settlement of a long legal battle between Disney and the state of Florida. Iger said the decision \u201cwill actually enable us to pursue the kind of significant investment in our Florida parks.\u201d Disney enthusiasts are expecting a trove of new information this August, when the company hosts its annual D23 Expo that focuses on upcoming projects and attractions. While the Galactic Starcruiser hotel has now earned a place in the annals of Disney lore, renewed interest in its failure provides a new lens through which to see Disney Parks\u2019 ambitions and expansions. Will they live up to everyone\u2019s wildest dreams, or be the subject of the next four-hour YouTube deep dive?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/travel/star-wars-hotel-disney-jenny-nicholson-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_little-britain-inn-germany-gary-blackburn", "text": "Rolling hills, thick forests and the Rhine River whirling through it all \u2013 the region of Rheinland-Pfalz, or Rhineland-Palatinate, is textbook Germany.

The entrance is guarded by two huge statues of lions (like the ones in Trafalgar Square), grenadier guards and a line-up of classic British cars. If that\u2019s not enough, there\u2019s also a life-size resin figure of the late Queen Elizabeth sitting on a bench beside the door, observing the comings and goings. Oh, and Prince William stands grinning behind a bench, next to those grenadier guards. Welcome to the Little Britain Inn, a corner of Germany that shall remain forever England. Step inside to a traditional British pub, where portraits of \u201cPeaky Blinders\u201d actors and lifesize Paddington Bears are your neighbors. Through the doorway is the restaurant, frescoed with medieval-style images of Robin Hood and his merry men. Upstairs, and across two buildings are the bedrooms \u2013 each themed with something British, from James Bond to her late majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, frescoed on the wall. While outside, in a space open to all, is a magical mystery tour of all things British. There are two double decker buses and lifesize statues of characters from film, TV and literature, from Mr. Bean and Jack Sparrow to Alice in Wonderland and Shaun the Sheep. Benches have plaques dedicating them to parts of the UK. Lifesize British bobbies (policemen) stand to attention beside a red carpet leading past the queen. Actually, make that queens \u2013 because there are two Elizabeths, one for each building. Wooden huts \u2013 which host the annual Christmas market and other special events \u2013 are bedecked with larger-than-life images of the royals: Kate and William, Meghan and Harry, Charles and Camilla, and the late queen with Paddington Bear, all superimposed on classic British landscapes. Oh, and there\u2019s a shrine to Princess Diana in a quieter part of the garden. Every year, members of a German fan club of the late princess gather here to pay their respects. Because that\u2019s the thing about the Little Britain Inn. Its biggest fans are German. This little patch of land in Vettelschloss has become a place where age-old rivals meet and remember what they like about each other. It sounds like a heartwarming tale of two cultures coming together \u2013 but it hasn\u2019t all been plain sailing. In fact, the reason the Little Britain Inn exists is because of a cross-cultural argument. A space to combat Brexit The Inn is the idea of Gary Blackburn, a Brit who moved to Germany in 1985, aged 21, with 50 marks (around $27) in his pocket, a small bag of clothes, and the dream of staying a few months, working as a tree surgeon. Nearly four decades later, Blackburn is still there. His tree surgery practice takes him all over Germany. He has brought up six children in the country and married twice: first to a German woman, and, for the past 22 years, to Monika, who\u2019s originally from Poland. Yet despite his cosmopolitan lifestyle, Blackburn always hankered after his homeland. Hence the collection of UK-themed memorabilia that he started in 2016 when he bought an old UK phone booth. It was in the wake of the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, and Blackburn was partly paying homage to his roots, but also wanting to do his bit to rebuild relations between the UK and the EU. \u201cI could see things were going to change, and people were asking what I thought about Brexit. So I started collecting things. The idea was to make a place where the Brits and the Germans could keep their friendship going,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone loved the queen, Germans still talk about her all the time. So I wanted to keep the German-British friendship, rather than have them turn against us for doing Brexit.\u201d The phone box was just the start. Then came the (first) lifesize model of the queen. Then came more. And more. Two double decker London buses \u2013 one of which is from 1966, the year that England infamously beat Germany in the World Cup soccer final \u2013 became the centerpiece of what he modestly calls \u201ca bit of a collection.\u201d In total, he actually has four buses, two of which are currently under restoration. \u201cI went a bit crazy,\u201d he admits. Initially Blackburn stored it all at his home, on the outskirts of the village. Germans visiting the Rhine area would pop by for a gawp, a photo and a chat. But in 2018 he hit a bump in the road. His newest purchase was a tank, and his neighbors  decided to object to the whole installation. The local authorities agreed. They missed the point, says Blackburn; the tank wasn\u2019t a declaration of war. For starters, it\u2019s a post-war model, he\u2019s keen to point out. \u201cIt\u2019s a monument for freedom and peace \u2013 that people shouldn\u2019t forget how horrible wars are,\u201d he says. The footpath running beside his house leads to land that was the scene of heavy fighting during World War II. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any bad intention. I wanted people to think, not hide things under the carpet.\u201d He certainly did make them think. When he was ordered to shut down his exhibition, it made worldwide headlines \u2013 and he received waves of support from Germans who\u2019d enjoyed seeing his homage to the UK when they came biking and hiking along the Rhine. They thought it was all over\u2026. But they didn\u2019t bargain on Blackburn having a cunning plan. A hotel to house his memorabilia Vettelschloss sits across the boundary of two local authorities. While the one in which Blackburn\u2019s home was situated \u2013 Erpel, in the district of Unkel \u2013 asked him to shutter the site, authorities on the other side of the village \u2013 Vettelschloss itself, under the jurisdiction of Linz \u2013 were making more hospitable noises. Blackburn estimates that he has spent over 500,000 euros ($535,000) on his collection. As well as the buses (one alone was 55,000 euros plus tax), he has a collection of cars including a Rolls-Royce, London taxis, a Mini, phone boxes, postboxes, multiple figures and even a Tardis from \u201cDoctor Who.\u201d \u201cI could have retired but this has been more fun, living my dreams and using my imagination,\u201d he says. Monika calls his collection \u201ccrazy.\u201d \u201cHe goes over the top \u2013 he doesn\u2019t buy just one thing, he buys four or five,\u201d she shrugs. So what do you do when your collection of UK memorabilia worth half a million dollars is shuttered by one half of the village? You move it to the other. In 2020, Blackburn saw a house on the Vettelschloss side of the boundary for sale for 350,000 euros ($375,000) and promptly snapped it up. \u201cI bought it to park the tank and the buses,\u201d he says, simply. But then he had a lightbulb moment. Instead of simply recreating the open-air exhibition space they\u2019d had before, they could open a hotel themed around the UK. Who opens a hotel during a pandemic? A man convinced that Germans will love memorabilia of the British royal family. He was right. The Little Britain Inn opened in September 2020, and was immediately so popular that the following year Blackburn bought the house next door to add more rooms, a restaurant and a pub. Today, the hotel caters to the hikers and cyclists who come for the Rhine Valley, as well as those who, according to Blackburn, come to Vettelschloss purely for the Little Britain Inn. Blackburn\u2019s collection \u2013 including the infamous tank, now painted in the colors of the Union Jack \u2013 is scattered around the two houses and the garden area between them. \u201cGermans love it \u2013 more Germans like England than you can imagine,\u201d he says, noting that their 9.3 rating on Booking.com is higher than that of the hotel nearby where the actual queen of England once stayed. The Little Britain Inn also rates 4.8 out of 5 on Google. \u201cLots of people come for a weekend, as a present,\u201d he says. \u201cThe food\u2019s really good. The sheets are Egyptian cotton, brought over from England. The towels are from Guildford (in the UK) \u2013 we spent 40,000 euros on bedding alone. Some of our best guests have been here eight or 10 times \u2013 it\u2019s like they\u2019re our friends.\u201d Today, the Little Britain Inn is going from strength to strength. Its last Christmas fair \u2013 where they sold traditional Cornish pasties, fish and chips, and beer galore, while a DJ and an Elvis impersonator provided the entertainment \u2013 was bigger than the one in the nearby town of Linz, says Blackburn. For the coronation last year, they put on a party, with guests arriving in Charles and Camilla masks. When Queen Elizabeth died, they stuck to a sober screening of the funeral. Rooms fit for a queen Hotel guests can pick one of the 12 rooms themed by place (like Cornwall, which has a mural of a clifftop scene painted behind the bed) or by person, whether real or fictional \u2013 including James Bond, Mr. Bean, Agatha Christie, Harry Potter and the late queen. All have themed murals behind the bed, in which no attention to detail has been spared \u2013 Blackburn says that when he noticed that some flowers in the Cornish room didn\u2019t look like the flowers that grow on Cornish clifftops, he got the artist back in to change them. Awakening in the morning, guests traipse down past the buses, tank and statues, to a full English breakfast of sausages, bacon, baked beans, toast and more. Everything is top quality \u2013 in fact, says Blackburn, everything is sourced from the UK, apart from the eggs. The tea, the beer, everything is shipped over from the UK \u2013 no wonder some Germans pop in for breakfast alone. They also have gin especially blended from them \u2013 the King Charles one is infused with honey, while the top-of-the-range bottle is called Lillibet (the late queen\u2019s nickname). Morning coffee and tea is served in mugs by chi-chi designer Emma Bridgewater with names of the royals painted on them. Those popping in during the day can try fish and chips, roast dinners, cream teas and more, all made by Monika, who had never attempted British food before opening the inn, and says she learned to make the cooked breakfasts and fish and chips by watching YouTube and Instagram videos. Meals are taken either in the medieval-themed dining room (the Robin Hood murals are recreations of the illustrations of a childhood book Blackburn\u2019s grandmother gave him), in the beer garden, or out the front, on a bench beside the queen or chairs underneath Prince William. Regulars have donated bits and pieces to the collection, from pictures of the royals to books, Harry Potter memorabilia and even a piano. About half his clients are German, he says \u2013 and regulars include local politicians, including the mayor of Vettelschloss. \u201cHe comes here, we drink beer, it\u2019s all fine,\u201d says Blackburn. \u201cThey\u2019re nice people.\u201d The other half are mainly made up of migrants and visitors from English-speaking countries, he says. Then there are others visiting the area for work or pleasure. People coming on business to Birkenstock and John Deere, which have factories nearby, stay at the Inn. On the night CNN was in the building, there were visitors from Argentina. Because despite the kitsch, the rooms are incredibly comfortable. Monika and the couple\u2019s daughters Emily and Alyson run the inn together. Emily, 20, is off to hotel school next to learn how to take things up a notch. Blackburn hopes that when he and Monika retire, the girls can take over the business. Cross-cultural contamination But for Blackburn, the Little Britain Inn isn\u2019t a hotel; it\u2019s a state of mind. And one the Germans share. \u201cThe Germans really respect the royals, and felt closer to the UK than anywhere else in the EU,\u201d he says. Blackburn says he hopes to retire back in the UK one day. He is, after all a fervent royalist. Monika is less so but says, diplomatically, \u201cI think England without the kings and queens wouldn\u2019t be the same.\u201d She generously let her husband name their dogs: Charles and Camilla, a red setter-Australian setter mix and a Altdeutsche Sch\u00e4ferhund (a breed known as an \u201cold German shepherd\u201d), who recently had puppies together. They\u2019re not the only ones with royal names in the family: Alyson\u2019s middle name is Diana, and one of Monika and Gary\u2019s sons is called William. The real Charles, Camilla and William may be around 330 miles northwest, but Blackburn lives in hope that one day he might get a royal knock on the door. \u201cI think they\u2019d really appreciate it \u2013 especially because they\u2019re part German,\u201d he says, opening the door of the gents toilets to reveal King Charles plastered over the toilet door, overlooking the urinals. Perhaps a state visit could be on the cards.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/little-britain-inn-germany-gary-blackburn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_vietnam-specialty-salt-coffee-hue-ca-phe-muoi", "text": "It\u2019s become a popular beverage trend on social media platforms like TikTok in recent months \u2013 how to customize your Starbucks order so it tastes like a Vietnamese iced coffee. And increasingly, some posters are including tips on how to request a specialized version of this sweet caffeinated beverage those in the know swear by \u2013 salt coffee, or ca phe muoi. A small, no-frills caf\u00e9 in Vietnam\u2019s historical city of Hue is widely credited with inventing this now-popular beverage, which is made by adding sweetened condensed milk to a base of Vietnamese coffee. The mixture is topped with salted cream and it\u2019s served hot or iced. \u201cWe created salt coffee in 2010 when we opened our first Ca Phe Muoi coffee shop at 10 Nguyen Luong Bang Street,\u201d co-owners Ho Thi Thanh Huong and Tran Nguyen Huu Phong tell CNN Travel via email. \u201cThis combination of condensed milk, salt and black coffee (creates a) creamy mixture that softens the bitterness of the coffee and balances the sweetness of the condensed milk.\u201d The name of the cafe and now-famous drink is telling. \u201cCa phe\u201d means coffee and \u201cmuoi\u201d means salt in Vietnamese. \u201cWe hoped this name would attract people because they always think that black coffee is only with sugar or milk\u2026 we thought that if we wanted to open a coffee shop we had to make (it a little different to) attract the customers, then the salt coffee taste would keep them with us,\u201d says the couple. The strategy worked. Curious locals and tourists began to visit \u2013 and they liked what they were drinking. \u201cHue people had a habit of drinking black coffee with sugar or condensed milk, so salty coffee was (considered) a strange drink,\u201d they add. \u201cWe were really grateful to our first customers, they were willing to try this strange drink, and gave us feedback so we quickly perfected the flavors.\u201d Before long, salt coffee became known as a specialty drink representing historic Hue and cafes around Vietnam began serving it as well. \u201cAfter the Covid-years, salt coffee seems to be a trend across Vietnam,\u201d say the Ca Phe Muoi founders. \u201cIn Hue, salt coffee became a daily drink like black coffee or white coffee so this trend brings more change to our business.\u201d Today, the caf\u00e9 bottles its salt coffee to sell in other Vietnamese cities as well. Though the name might turn people off, the flavors really do work. The sweetened milk and cream balances the bitterness of the coffee, and salt heightens the sweetness \u2013 much like how a little bit of salt in salted caramel makes the caramel flavors more prominent. Even Starbucks\u2019 branches in Vietnam have joined the salt coffee wave, launching their own version of ca phe muoi in May this year. Vietnam isn\u2019t the only country that adds salt to its coffee. In 2023, a Bon Appetit article suggested we should all be adding it to our brews to cut some of the bitterness and heighten the flavors, noting the\u00a0tradition goes back hundreds of years\u00a0in countries like Turkey, Hungary and Siberia. Growing global interest in Vietnamese coffee Vietnam, which primarily grows\u00a0robusta beans, is the world\u2019s second-largest exporter of coffee after Brazil. The country\u2019s coffee exports have already hit $2.9 billion in the first five months of this year, marking a 43.9% increase over the same period last year, according to the International Trade Council. That salt coffee has become ubiquitous around cafes in Hue and a common option on menus across Vietnam nowadays shouldn\u2019t come as much of a surprise. First introduced by French colonists in the 1850s, coffee is extremely popular throughout the country. Coffee outlets range from hole-in-the-wall counters with plastic stools on the sidewalk, to sleek, contemporary cafes with roasters on the premises. (Read more about Vietnam\u2019s vibrant coffee culture here.) Traditional Vietnamese coffee is brewed in a phin \u2013 a metal, filtered brewing device \u2013 that\u2019s  placed over a cup or pot. Many people prefer to stir a tablespoon or two of sweetened condensed milk into the strong brew. And salt coffee is just one of several distinctive Vietnamese coffee drinks that might raise a few eyebrows among those who\u2019ve yet to sample them. Perhaps the most famous of them all is egg coffee, or ca phe trung. Invented in Hanoi, this dessert-like recipe adds a topping of egg yolks, frothed with condensed milk, to a coffee base. And then there\u2019s coconut coffee \u2013\u00a0ca phe cot dua \u2013 which features coffee blended with coconut milk and ice \u2013 a cold treat with a tropical kick. In fruit shake coffee\u00a0\u2013 sinh to ca phe \u2013 coffee is combined with banana or avocado to produce a smoothie. And finally, there\u2019s yogurt coffee\u00a0\u2013 sua chua ca phe\ufeff \u2013 which features black coffee drizzled onto creamy Vietnamese yogurt, another French legacy. According to a report by global market research agency Mintel released in 2023, consumers outside Asia are increasingly interested in these novel coffee experiences and flavors. Some 71% of Gen Z consumers interviewed by Mintel in the US said that they were interested in trying Asian-inspired coffee drinks such as Vietnamese coffee. In the US, 7 Leaves Caf\u00e9, a caf\u00e9 chain selling Vietnamese drinks, has expanded to more than 40 branches across the country after opening its first caf\u00e9 in California in 2011. Meanwhile, independent Vietnamese cafes have been popping up around the country, with Phin Ca Phe in Seattle and C\u00e0ph\u00ea Roasters in Philadelphia among those offering versions of salt coffee. Across the Atlantic in London, venues like Caphe House offer various Vietnamese coffee drinks including ca phe trung. Back in Hue, Huong and Phong say the majority of their patrons order salt coffee, though there are other items on the menu such as chanh xi muoi, a special house-made lemonade with salted lemon jam. And though they serve both iced and hot versions of salt coffee, they think the former is the tastiest option. The couple now has a second, bigger branch of Ca Phe Muoi just a stone\u2019s throw away from the palace and the moat of the ancient Hue Imperial City. \u201cWe feel joy and a little pride because we made a drink that is loved by many people and it is even considered a Hue specialty,\u201d they say.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/vietnam-specialty-salt-coffee-hue-ca-phe-muoi/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_vacation-fling-love-story-chance-encounters", "text": "Guillermo Barrantes relationship with Larry Mock was supposed to begin and end in Palm Springs. It was a \u201ccasual, brief encounter.\u201d A vacation dalliance that only lasted half a day. \u201cIt was just so casual, so easily nothing could have happened from it,\u201d Guillermo tells CNN Travel. \u201cWe could have walked away and just had our lives separate. But of course that didn\u2019t happen, because it wasn\u2019t meant to be that way. It was meant to be the way that it was. That it is.\u201d It all started in summer 2013. Guillermo - then in his early 40s - was on vacation in the California resort city of Palm Springs. He was in a phase of life where, he says, he was prioritizing himself, and wasn\u2019t interested in long term romance. \u201cI thrived in being by myself, in traveling by myself, in having dinner by myself \u2013 I loved all of that so much,\u201d says Guillermo, who lived in Boston, Massachusetts at the time. \u201cI wanted no commitment, I wanted no emotional entanglement of any kind. I wanted to have fun, get to know myself. And it was in that mode that I met Larry, when I wasn\u2019t really looking.\u201d During the vacation in Palm Springs, Guillermo was staying at a friend\u2019s apartment, and while the friend worked during the day, Guillermo passed his time at a \u201crun-down, no-frills\u201d resort a couple of blocks away. \u201cYou could just pay for a day pass, they\u2019d give you a towel, and you could be in the pool and use their bar,\u201d he recalls. One day, as he was walking the palm tree-lined streets to the resort, Guillermo swiped right on a guy on a dating app \u2013 Larry Mock, mid-40s, friendly smile. The two men exchanged a few messages back and forth. Larry said he was also on vacation in Palm Springs, staying in the resort Guillermo kept frequenting. They arranged to meet there for a drink by the pool. Guillermo was looking forward to meeting Larry, expecting \u201csome casual fun.\u201d Then, when Guillermo and Larry met, there was \u201cchemistry\u201d right away. Guillermo calls their connection \u201cmagnetic.\u201d \u201cMy impression of Larry: sexy, handsome and warm,\u201d he recalls. Larry was a Texas-based American Airlines flight attendant who\u2019d booked the vacation to Palm Springs at the last minute. He\u2019d recently broken up with a long-term partner but due to lease and budget reasons the two were still living together \u2013 awkwardly \u2013 in Dallas, Texas. Larry\u2019s workdays were spent traveling the world. But during his downtime, he struggled to relax in the apartment with his ex, and this sentiment motivated the spontaneous vacation. \u201cI needed to get out of town for the weekend, because we were just butting heads badly at that time,\u201d Larry tells CNN Travel today. Larry searched his airline\u2019s database, looking at destinations he could visit using the last minute, standby flight tickets available for flight attendants. \u201cPalm Springs had seats, so I booked my standby flight, got to Palm Springs, checked into this resort. And that\u2019s where Guillermo came into the picture,\u201d says Larry. Larry was instantly attracted to Guillermo. He thought he was \u201cjust the most handsome guy\u201d he\u2019d ever seen. And as they got chatting, and Guillermo kept making Larry laugh, Larry sketched out his first impression to include two more adjectives: \u201cso funny, and so kind.\u201d In passing, as the two flirted over pool-side cocktails, Larry mentioned that he was a flight attendant. Guillermo lit up. In fact, his response was \u201cgiddy,\u201d as Larry recalls it. \u201cHe started asking me tons of questions about planes, and flight attendants, and the routes and all of that kind of stuff.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a huge aviation geek,\u201d explains Guillermo. As a kid growing up in Costa Rica, he\u2019d wanted to be a pilot. Instead, he ended up working as an IT consultant. And while he says he was good at that job, liked it well enough and made good money \u2013 he still dreamed about working in aviation. Meeting a flight attendant was fascinating. \u201cI was immediately drawn to his career,\u201d says Guillermo. Larry found Guillermo\u2019s enthusiasm for aviation charming, and happily answered his questions. Later that evening, Larry and Guillermo said their goodbyes, with no plans to meet again. \u201cI was glad to meet him,\u201d says Larry. \u201cBut I was like, \u2018There\u2019s no way I am going to pursue dating somebody that lived in Boston.\u2019 And I still was dealing with what I was dealing with in Dallas.\u201d \u201cWe just really enjoyed the time that we had together,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cBut we went our separate ways.\u201d Unexpected moments Almost without realizing \u2013 and certainly without intending to \u2013 Guillermo and Larry stayed in touch. \u201cWe kept chatting, we kept texting,\u201d says Guillermo. Then, a few days after meeting Larry, Guillermo got an unexpected phone call from his mother in Costa Rica. He was still in Palm Springs at the time. \u201cShe said, \u2018I don\u2019t want you to freak out, but I just got diagnosed with breast cancer. I don\u2019t want you to change the trip.\u2019\u201d Guillermo tried to protest, but his mother insisted he should enjoy the rest of his vacation. She reassured him that her sisters and Guillermo\u2019s father were taking care of her, and she\u2019d see Guillermo later in the month \u2013 he already had a trip to Costa Rica scheduled for that summer. Not wanting to go against his mother\u2019s wishes, Guillermo stayed put in the desert. He tried to \u201ccompartmentalize\u201d the news, but he was really close to his mom, and it was cataclysmic. Later, back home in Boston, Guillermo found himself sharing his mother\u2019s news with Larry, and confiding in him about his fears and worries. He added that his mother lived in Costa Rica, so he\u2019d likely be flying back and forth for the rest of the year. Larry was supportive, empathetic \u2013 and he told Guillermo that he should use the discounted flights Larry got through work. Guillermo was taken aback \u2013 it was \u201csuch a sweet gesture\u201d from someone who was basically a stranger. But then, somehow, Larry already felt much more than that. \u201cVery early on, he and I had just beautiful interactions, and it revealed the kind of person that he was,\u201d he says. And so, rather than dwindling, Larry and Guillermo\u2019s communication increased as the days rolled on. \u201cWithin just a few weeks, we just knew \u2013 without much discussion, without talking about it \u2013 we just knew that there was a very, very strong connection there,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cWe always had something to talk about,\u201d says Larry. Larry was still hesitant about jumping into something new, following the breakdown of his previous relationship. But the messages back and forth with Guillermo became a highlight of his day. And as time passed, he found himself opening up to Guillermo, confiding in him. \u201cAfter a few months, I was like, \u2018Yes, this is exactly what I was looking for my whole life. Someone that I can be my authentic self with,\u2019\u201d says Larry. Long-distance dating In September 2013, two months after their Palm Springs meeting, Larry arranged to visit Guillermo in Boston. At Logan Airport, Larry came down the escalator and spotted Guillermo\u2019s face in the crowd. He was beaming, and started running towards Larry. Then, Guillermo \u201chugged me so hard,\u201d recalls Larry. He remembers thinking, \u201cOh my god, this is the one.\u201d Then Guillermo and Larry went to Boston\u2019s seaport district together, and found a sundrenched rooftop bar where they sat drinking beers. \u201cWe could see the planes approaching Logan, and it was just a sunny and perfect Boston day,\u201d recalls Guillermo. \u201cI remember that, like a picture, sitting by the edge \u2013 I remember the beer and I remember the planes.\u201d It was \u201cmagical,\u201d says Guillermo, but also slightly \u201csurreal.\u201d The Palm Springs encounter was so brief. He never thought he\u2019d see Larry again. And now here Larry was, sitting opposite him, in Guillermo\u2019s city. From there, Guillermo and Larry started dating cross-country. They took advantage of Larry\u2019s discounted flights. Sometimes Larry traveled to Boston, but usually Guillermo visited Larry in Dallas. Guillermo\u2019s love of flying meant that, for him, the four-hour journey across the country was part of the fun. \u201cI was in heaven,\u201d he says. \u201cJust the fact that I was getting to do something that I have always just loved - which is being on an airplane and going somewhere.\u201d Each Friday, as he packed his bag and headed to the airport, Guillermo would also be struck with \u201cexcitement\u201d at the thought of seeing Larry. And during these weekend visits, Guillermo and Larry grew accustomed to each other\u2019s habits, how they moved through their days, how they liked to spend their time. Guillermo got to know Larry\u2019s friends and got to know Dallas as a city. They spoke about their hopes, dreams, ambitions and families. Guillermo says it was obvious that they were \u201cvery aligned on the important aspects of life: how we view finances, closeness with families, politically and world views and enjoyment of the small things in life.\u201d Larry supported Guillermo as he cared for his mother through her cancer, and celebrated with him when she recovered. \u201cFor us, it was a gradual process of falling in love,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cBut a theme for us in our life together is that everything felt right and natural.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t pinpoint the moment, but we simply knew very deep in our hearts that we found the life partner.\u201d \u201cThat made me so happy,\u201d says Larry. For Guillermo, moving to Dallas two years later, in late 2015, was \u201cjust as the easiest decision.\u201d Larry was thrilled. His Dallas-based friendship group had already welcomed Guillermo into the fold, and his parents were happy for him too. \u201cI introduced Guillermo to everybody,\u201d says Larry. \u201cMy family\u2019s always been very accepting of me.\u201d Guillermo\u2019s family situation was more complicated. He\u2019s always been very close with his parents and siblings, but for the first two decades of his adult life, he didn\u2019t talk to his family about relationships. \u201cMy personal life was not necessarily an open book,\u201d Guillermo says. \u201cLove has never been the question - my parents love me, I love my parents and my sisters, we all get along great. But there was always that invisible barrier, which was: I don\u2019t talk about my personal relationships.\u201d But Guillermo didn\u2019t want to hide Larry from anyone - he felt he owed that to himself, and to Larry. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to edit myself, I wasn\u2019t going to filter. I just knew deep in my heart that it was my chance to be able to truly be myself,\u201d he says. So Guillermo started peppering his phone calls home with mentions of Larry. He uploaded cute photos of the two of them to social media. \u201cI\u2019m fearless,\u201d he told himself. \u201cNothing bad can happen here.\u201d A monumental year Cut to 2018, which was a monumental year for Guillermo and Larry for a couple of reasons. For one, it was the year Guillermo followed in Larry\u2019s footsteps and became a flight attendant. It was a mutual friend who suggested Guillermo should give it a shot, and Larry \u2013 who\u2019d spent years listening to Guillermo wax lyrical about airplanes \u2013 was wholeheartedly encouraging. Guillermo applied to Larry\u2019s airline, American Airlines, but wasn\u2019t accepted. But then he applied to Delta, and was accepted on the spot. While Guillermo and Larry loved the idea of working together, flying with different airlines also \u201cworked out great,\u201d says Guillermo. For one, there were two different sets of airline benefits to enjoy. And working in the air was everything Guillermo hoped it would be and more. \u201cI was doing my dream job, my childhood dream job,\u201d he says. \u201cI still have to pinch myself that actually, I am a flight attendant.\u201d 2018 was also the year Guillermo and Larry got married. Guillermo proposed to Larry on an airplane. The couple were flying back to Dallas after visiting San Francisco, where they\u2019d attended an Adele concert. As they were descending, the Dallas lights glistening out the airplane window, Guillermo suddenly felt the time was right. He turned to Larry and asked him to marry him. Larry smiled, and said yes. \u201cDespite it being impromptu, as an aviation geek, I love that I proposed on a flight,\u201d says Guillermo. The couple started planning their nuptials. Guillermo was excited, but he was unsure what role \u2013 if any \u2013 his family would play on the wedding day. While Guillermo had mentioned Larry to his parents, they still hadn\u2019t met him. This was partly because Guillermo\u2019s family were in Costa Rica, and partly because Guillermo wasn\u2019t sure how that meeting would play out. \u201cThe person that I had the most trouble with was my father \u2013 because he was the one that had the hardest time really accepting me,\u201d says Guillermo. As plans for the wedding started to take shape, Guillermo composed a long email to his father. \u201cI said something to the effect of, \u2018Hey Dad, I know I really haven\u2019t really talked much about any of my personal life. But I met this person, Larry, who is the love of my life. We are going to get married. Come, don\u2019t come, no problem. But I just need to tell you because this is probably one of the most important days and times of my life.\u2019\u201d Guillermo\u2019s father didn\u2019t attend the wedding. \u201cFor those reasons and also because he was towards the end of his life, his mobility was a problem,\u201d Guillermo says. \u201cBut my mom, my sisters, my niece and my nephew came, which was far more than I ever imagined or dreamed. That was such a great moment.\u201d Guillermo introduced his mother and sisters to Larry a couple of days before the wedding. They all gathered at a rooftop bar in Dallas, along with Guillermo and Larry\u2019s close friends. When Guillermo\u2019s mother saw Larry for the first time, she enveloped Larry in her arms. The two hit it off right away. Guillermo was overwhelmed with happiness. \u201cFor me, to see Larry and mom interact \u2013 they just love each other so much,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cAnd my sisters just cannot get enough of him \u2013 I just sit back, and just enjoy.\u201d A magical wedding day Guillermo and Larry\u2019s wedding took place at the Dallas Arboretum, a botanical garden. It was an outdoor wedding, and the couple woke up to the rain pouring and concerned texts from guests worried how the wedding would play out in a downpour. \u201cBut then, sure enough, out came the sun at the right time,\u201d recalls Guillermo. Larry and Guillermo wrote their own vows and read them to each other during the ceremony. Guillermo told Larry that he inspired him to be a better son, sibling, friend and person. \u201cYou want a partner that is going to challenge you to be better,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cI always feel that I want to be a better human being just in general, because he is such a figure in my life and everyone\u2019s life \u2013 he is the center of everybody\u2019s life.\u201d In turn, Larry promised Guillermo their married life would be \u201cexciting, adventurous and full of passion.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m proud to take you as my husband. I promise to fly with you to the ends of the earth,\u201d Larry said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to grow old together and look back at this beautiful moment.\u201d He ended the vows telling Guillermo: \u201cTe amo\u201d \u2013 Spanish for \u201cI love you.\u201d The reception was held at a local winery. During the celebrations, Guillermo and Larry danced to Rihanna\u2019s hit \u201cWe Found Love,\u201d which includes the lyric: \u201cWe found love in a hopeless place.\u201d The couple felt it was fitting \u2013 the resort they met at did seem a bit of a \u201chopeless place.\u201d And they never expected that brief meeting would lead to a lasting love. \u201cWe made sure that song was played, because we did find love in a hopeless place,\u201d says Larry. \u201cAnd I love Rihanna, too,\u201d says Guillermo. At one point, Guillermo and Larry walked through the reception doors holding hands, spontaneously lifting their arms in the air, a \u201cvictorious\u201d pose, as Guillermo put it. \u201cIt was just an electric effect,\u201d he says. The last piece of the puzzle A few years into their marriage, Guillermo and Larry visited Costa Rica together for the first time. Larry was excited to see Guillermo\u2019s home country, and Guillermo was excited to show his husband where he grew up \u2013 and the visit was also an opportunity for Larry to finally meet Guillermo\u2019s father. Guillermo was nervous about how the meeting would play out, but when he arrived at his parents\u2019 house with Larry in tow, Guillermo\u2019s father opened his arms and hugged Larry tightly. \u201cHe said, \u2018Welcome home,\u2019\u201d says Guillermo. It was a cathartic, emotional moment for everyone. \u201cI was so nervous that day, meeting the father-in-law,\u201d says Larry. \u201cAnd when he just said \u2018welcome home,\u2019 and hugged me, every bit of nerves went away. I felt comfortable, I felt welcomed, I felt loved.\u201d Larry says the moment felt like the \u201clast piece\u201d of a puzzle slotting into place. Guillermo was overjoyed. \u201cThat evening, which we got to spend \u2013 me, mom, dad, and Larry \u2013 was just a highlight,\u201d says Guillermo. The family played old records on a turntable. Guillermo and his mother danced in the living room, while Larry and Guillermo\u2019s father sipped cocktails and watched, laughing. \u201cI had to just step back, because you have to look at those moments and just kind of create a little mini movie of them,\u201d says Guillermo. Guillermo\u2019s father has since passed away, which makes Guillermo and Larry all the more grateful for that time together in Costa Rica. In general, a feeling of gratitude defines Guillermo and Larry\u2019s relationship \u2013 gratitude for each other and what they\u2019ve brought to one another\u2019s lives, and gratitude that their paths crossed over ten years ago. On their anniversary, the couple usually return to Palm Springs to celebrate the day they met. \u201cNot only is Palm Springs beautiful with a great vibe, but we love to go back and celebrate our meeting place,\u201d says Larry. \u201cWe weren\u2019t looking, neither one of us \u2013 but it did happen, and it\u2019s definitely for life.\u201d \u201cWhat a gift,\u201d says Guillermo, who says his life today is what he dreamed of \u201cas a little gay boy in Costa Rica, always loving the US, always loving airplanes, always envisioning that I would have a relationship where we are completely free to show our love.\u201d \u201cAnd we do, we do,\u201d he says. \u201cWho could ask for anything more?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/vacation-fling-love-story-chance-encounters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_chance-encounters-retirees-train-second-chance-love", "text": "John Nears looked forward to the trip to South America for years. The vacation was planned by John\u2019s wife Pam, in anticipation of John\u2019s upcoming retirement. Pam mapped out the route, researched the trains and almost \u2013 but not quite \u2013 booked the flights. Then everything got derailed. Pam fell ill with cancer. In 2000, at the age of 63, she died. \u201cI thought life was over for me,\u201d John, who lives in the New Forest, in southwest England, tells CNN Travel today. John had been married to Pam for over 40 years. When retirement rolled around, he felt none of the jubilation or excitement he\u2019d once anticipated. But as days turned into months and months turned into years, John found his thoughts returning to the long-awaited South America trip. After thinking it over, John decided following Pam\u2019s itinerary would be what she\u2019d have wanted \u2013 and going on the vacation in her absence would be a tribute to her. He persuaded his recently divorced friend Chris to join him on the adventure and in March 2004, four years after Pam\u2019s death, the two men embarked on the trip. The six week vacation included marveling at Peru\u2019s Nazca Lines and the salt flats of Bolivia. But the unexpected highlight was a 10-hour train journey across Peru \u2013 from Cusco to Puno. \u201cThis was no normal train,\u201d John recalls. \u201cIt was Orient Express-style with bow tie waiters, cabaret and an observation carriage at the rear.\u201d John and Chris boarded the carriage, searched for their seats, and realized they were booked on a table for four. Already seated at the table were two smartly dressed, smiling American women. John and Chris greeted their seatmates, who introduced themselves as Judy Curtis and Judy Malody. They were two friends from the US who shared not only a first name, but a love of travel. They were both friendly and welcoming, but John was drawn to Judy Curtis right away. He liked the manner in which she spoke \u2013 direct yet warm \u2013 and her smile. \u201cI thought she was attractive,\u201d John says today. \u201cI also thought we would be ships that passed in the night, as the saying goes.\u201d As the train meandered through the Andes, Chris, John, Judy and Judy enjoyed each other\u2019s company. They talked about their lives and travels, and admired the spectacular views. It was Chris who, at the end of the journey, suggested they all swap email addresses. Then the group said their goodbyes, assuming they\u2019d never see each other again. A few hours later, at the Puno hotel, John was waiting for the elevator when he spotted the two Judys walking through the lobby. It turned out the women were staying at the same hotel as John and Chris. John surprised himself by how happy he was to see Judy Curtis again. He suggested they all dine together that evening, which they did, before once again going their separate ways. Back home in the UK, John thought about Judy fondly from time to time. But he didn\u2019t reach out. He was quickly absorbed back into his life in the UK, and the day spent riding the train in Peru felt an increasingly distant memory. But little did he know that Judy, back home in San Diego, California, was thinking fondly of him too. Reaching out In 2004, Judy was \u2013 like John \u2013 a retiree in her 60s. Her husband had passed away several years previously and since then, Judy had tried to make her own luck. She didn\u2019t believe in waiting around for things to happen, for people to call, for life to go your way. So when Judy found herself wondering about the English man from the train, she decided to go ahead and get in touch with him. \u201cHe was kind of interesting to me,\u201d she tells CNN Travel. \u201cSo I contacted him.\u201d In June 2006, around three months after returning from South America, Judy dropped John a friendly email. \u201cIf you\u2019re ever in the US, let me know,\u201d she wrote. When John spotted the email in his inbox, he was delighted. But then he realized it wasn\u2019t clear from the email address or sign off which Judy had contacted him \u2013 he had met two, after all. \u201cWhich Judy is this?\u201d John wrote in response. Judy replied with an email with a photo of herself, smiling. And so began a back and forth that lasted for the next few months. The emails were fun and light, filled with stories of travels and family, comparing life in the UK to life in the US. Judy and John enjoyed their correspondence, but \u201cit was nothing romantic,\u201d says John. \u201cI thought he might become my buddy,\u201d says Judy. Then, in one of his emails, John mentioned he planned to visit New York that fall to visit his cousin, who lived there. Judy suggested John should tack on a visit to California. \u201cI\u2019d never been to the West Coast of the United States, only the East Coast,\u201d recalls John. \u201cBut I thought it would be a wonderful adventure to go to the West Coast. And so there I went, off to the West Coast \u2013 left my cousin in New York for a week \u2013 and met up with Judy, in San Diego.\u201d Judy told John she\u2019d meet him off the plane at San Diego International Airport. In one of her emails, she mentioned she was a bit concerned she wouldn\u2019t recognize him \u2013 after all, she\u2019d only met him once, several months previously. \u201cSo I said, \u2018I\u2019ll be wearing a revolving bow tie and a top hat,\u2019\u201d recalls John. \u201cAnd I made a giant bow tie with the Stars and Stripes on one side, and the Union Jack on the other, and put it on as I left the plane.\u201d Judy was waiting for John at San Diego arrivals. She spotted John right away, his top hat towering above the crowd. Judy started laughing. They hugged. While Judy jokes John\u2019s get-up was \u201cslightly embarrassing,\u201d she felt an instant ease with him. She\u2019d arranged for John to stay at a friend\u2019s vacation rental down the road from her house \u2013 she\u2019d been wary about inviting this man who was pretty much a stranger to stay at her home. But after only a few hours in John\u2019s company, Judy felt like she\u2019d known him for years. As for John, he loved exploring San Diego, and loved getting to know Judy. \u201cWe had a great time,\u201d he says. \u201cJudy took me here, there and everywhere in the San Diego Area. It was really nice.\u201d When the two said their goodbyes at the end of the week, John found himself thinking that they \u201chad a nice relationship possibly developing.\u201d \u201cWe both thought we\u2019d like to meet again.\u201d Growing closer John invited Judy to visit the UK, and she did \u2013 a few months later, in January 2005. The trip coincided with Judy\u2019s birthday. \u201cI thought, \u2018It\u2019s no good being in the UK in the winter,\u2019\u201d recalls John. \u201cSo I booked a trip to Madeira. And we had a wonderful holiday.\u201d John organized tea at the glamorous Madeira\u2019s Reid Palace Hotel, overlooking Funchal bay. The hotel surprised John and Judy with a birthday bottle of champagne waiting in their room. \u201cThe trip to Madeira really cemented our relationship,\u201d says John. \u201cWe knew we were very compatible in every way, it felt complete like that.\u201d Back in their respective homes on opposite sides of the Atlantic, John and Judy started planning their next adventure together. They also confided in their friends and loved ones about their burgeoning feelings. Judy\u2019s friend \u2013 the other Judy, who\u2019d been there that day on the train in Peru \u2013 was especially delighted. She was happy that her dear friend had found someone with whom to enjoy life. \u201cJohn is a fun person to be with,\u201d she tells CNN Travel. \u201cIt\u2019s been wonderful to be even a tiny part of this whole relationship and to see it blossom.\u201d In the UK, John\u2019s two adult children were pleased their father had found unexpected happiness in the wake of their mother\u2019s passing. John\u2019s daughter commented that Judy seemed similar, in many ways, to John\u2019s late wife Pam. John also has two grandchildren who became close to Judy as the relationship developed. As for Judy, her adult daughter welcomed John into their lives. And Judy\u2019s also close with her community of San Diego neighbors. Judy\u2019s friends quickly fell in love with John, who set up a British-themed pub quiz in their neighborhood. \u201cEveryone in my neighborhood knows him. And he knows every house and everybody who lives here. And so he\u2019s always part of the group, from the beginning,\u201d says Judy. In the UK, John\u2019s friends loved it when this glamorous American woman visited town. His friend Chris, who he\u2019s still close with, was happy to have played a role in the relationship coming together \u2013 after all, he was the one to initiate the email swap. \u201cWe\u2019ve had good support systems in both countries,\u201d says John. \u201cPeople in the States welcomed me, and people over here welcomed Judy as part of the family.\u201d In time, John and Judy established a pattern \u2013 regular vacations together, and splitting time between the US and the UK, as well as enjoying their independence. They never really had a formal conversation about the arrangement, says Judy, it just developed naturally. \u201cWe would talk about where we would like to go, and we had all sorts of books and whatnot. But I think what we decided to do was, when it was on his continent he could choose and when it was on my continent, I could choose,\u201d she says. The two travel well together \u2013 whether it\u2019s driving through the US national parks or exploring Antarctica. \u201cWe never really disagree on anything,\u201d says John. \u2018A second life\u2019 It\u2019s now 20 years since John and Judy first met. John describes the past two decades as a \u201csecond life\u201d \u2013 one filled with happiness and adventures he never anticipated. \u201cJudy and I have been to something like 38 countries together, which is quite an amazing situation,\u201d he reflects. \u201cFrom Iceland, in the north, to Antarctica in the south. Kenya, Tanzania, Turkey\u2026\u201d Today, Judy is 83 and John is 87. They last saw one another at the end of 2023, when John took the Cunard Queen Mary 2 cruise ship across the Atlantic to visit Judy. John\u2019s now wondering if this might have been his last trip to the US. It\u2019s a bittersweet thought. \u201cSadly, I think when you get towards the 90s, as I am, international travel is not good fun,\u201d he says. The couple are \u201crealistic\u201d about the future, says John. Health and age means they may not be able to travel together again. But they refuse to feel sad about this fact. Instead, John and Judy are focusing on the joy they\u2019ve experienced together over the past two decades. They\u2019re in touch regularly and video chat every other day or so via communication app WhatsApp. On their calls, John shares funny stories about his volunteer job at a local charity shore. Meanwhile Judy chats about movies and TV shows she\u2019s been enjoying. The two often revisit what Judy calls the \u201cwonderful memories\u201d of their 20 years of adventures. CNN Travel joined one of these calls. There was a lot of laughter and fond reminiscing between John and Judy. \u201cI feel privileged,\u201d John told Judy on the call. \u201cIt\u2019s been such a wonderful relationship.\u201d \u201cThank you, sweetheart,\u201d said Judy to John, smiling into her cell phone from across the Atlantic. \u201cI agree with that.\u201d As John and Judy haven\u2019t been able to meet this year, they\u2019ve both been spending time reflecting on past adventures. \u201cI\u2019m spending more time now looking at the pictures over and over and over,\u201d says Judy. \u201cWe took a lot of pictures. And it\u2019s been fun.\u201d John\u2019s been focused on writing up his memories of his life and travels. He hopes to pass on these chronicles to his children and grandchildren one day. Thinking back on his life, John says he feels inordinately lucky to have enjoyed two great love stories. \u201cI was lucky to have met my wife,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I was also lucky to meet another lovely lady. And to have had another lifetime.\u201d \u201cWhen you\u2019ve lost a partner \u2013 and I was married over 40 years \u2013 life doesn\u2019t end at that point,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible. But it doesn\u2019t end and a new life starts. I think that\u2019s important for older people who\u2019ve lost their partners to think that life can continue in a different way, maybe \u2013 and maybe just as fulfilling as it was in the first place.\u201d John likes to think his serendipitous meeting with Judy on the Peruvian train was preordained in some way. He finds it moving, and comforting, that the trip to Peru was his late wife Pam\u2019s dream. \u201cIt was almost like Pam had planned it,\u201d he says.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/chance-encounters-retirees-train-second-chance-love/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_article_chance-encounters-florence-italy-kacie-rose", "text": "Kacie Rose Burns walked into the Florence jazz bar, alone. \u201cI\u2019ll go for one song and suss it out,\u201d she thought, trying to quieten her nerves. Kacie slipped in at the back. The club was dark and busy, a few wall lights and neon signs illuminating people drinking, dancing and chatting. Before she could even take in the musicians on stage, Kacie\u2019s eyes landed on a tall man sitting at the bar. \u201cI walked in and he was there,\u201d Kacie tells CNN Travel today. \u201cWe clocked eyes.\u201d \u201cCiao,\u201d said the stranger, smiling. \u201cCiao,\u201d Kacie said back, before adding apologetically: \u201cThat\u2019s all the Italian I\u2019ve got for you.\u201d It was October 2018. Kacie was a 24-year-old New Yorker on vacation in Florence. It was her first time in Italy and her first time traveling solo. It was an exciting \u2013 and terrifying \u2013 experience. \u201cI was a professional dancer in New York,\u201d explains Kacie. \u201cA very exhausting career \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of toxicity, a lot of rejection, there\u2019s a lot of politics that come into play \u2013 and I was feeling a little stuck, a little unhappy, a little \u2013 just stagnant, if you will.\u201d Kacie spent her days auditioning, traveling for gigs and moonlighting at a clothing store. She needed a break, and she\u2019d long felt a \u201cpull\u201d to Italy and dreamed of an Italian vacation. \u201cI kept saying, \u2018I\u2019ll wait for somebody to go with, I\u2019ll wait, I\u2019ll wait. And then I was waiting for years. And so then one night \u2013 at two in the morning \u2013 I was like, \u2018What am I waiting for? Life is too short.\u2019 So I booked a solo trip to Italy.\u201d Kacie planned to spend the majority of her time in Rome and Venice and just a couple of days in Florence. But in the lead-up to the trip, she got chatting to a customer at the store she worked at. This woman had lived in Florence for five years and sung the Tuscan city\u2019s praises, persuading Kacie to add an extra day to her Florence stint. And that\u2019s how Kacie and the Italian stranger happened to be in the jazz club on the same evening. \u201cI\u2019m really glad that I listened to her,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cThat\u2019s the only reason why we met on the first night that I was in Florence, on that earlier day that I wasn\u2019t originally supposed to be there.\u201d A Florence meeting The man Kacie crossed paths with in the jazz bar was 26-year-old Dario Nencetti, a chef in a Florence hotel who usually worked nights. It just so happened that was the only evening he had off that week. The jazz bar, called Jazz Club Firenze, was one of Dario\u2019s favorite hangouts. He loved the music, the underground ambiance and the fact the bar encouraged punters to sign up for jam sessions. \u201cThat place is, let\u2019s say, unconventional for Florence,\u201d Dario tells CNN Travel. \u201cUsually in Florence, there\u2019s like a table for two or three or four people. In the jazz club, there are big tables, so you can sit with strangers and stuff, which I love.\u201d When Dario realized Kacie didn\u2019t know much Italian beyond \u201cciao,\u201d they switched to English. Dario told Kacie he\u2019d lived in Scotland for a year, and they got talking about travel. Kacie mentioned she was on her first solo trip and Dario said he\u2019d embarked on a similar adventure to Japan earlier that year. \u201cWe bonded from the beginning,\u201d says Dario. \u201cIt was really natural, really easy conversation.\u201d \u201cI remember he made me laugh,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Oh, this guy\u2019s interesting.\u201d So many people ask us, \u2018How did you know?\u2019 And I don\u2019t know how I knew. I was just like, \u2018Oh, this is something different.\u2019\u201d Kacie and Dario stayed at the jazz bar talking into the early hours of the morning. Then they spent as much time as possible together over the next two days. \u201cHe would meet me after his work \u2013 every night he got off at 11. And we would go out and we would just talk,\u201d recalls Kacie. \u201cI instantly fell in love with Florence. It\u2019s a very romantic city - cobblestone streets and medieval buildings. It looks like a painting everywhere you look.\u201d It was a whirlwind two days. One evening they sat by Florence\u2019s Ponte Vecchio bridge and talked until 3 or 4 a.m. It was as though Kacie was in a film \u2013 somewhere between every millennial\u2019s favorite \u201cThe Lizzie McGuire Movie\u201d and classic Florentine romance \u201cA Room with a View.\u201d Then, the two days were up and Kacie had to continue onto the next leg of her trip. It was still like something from a movie \u2013 only it wasn\u2019t obvious this one had a happy ending. \u201cI got on the train and he was standing on the platform. And I remember looking out the train, and I was so sad,\u201d she says. As the train pulled away from the station, Kacie wiped away tears and messaged her best friend back home in New York. \u201cI just met my future husband in Florence,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s the guy I\u2019m gonna marry. I\u2019m never gonna see him again.\u201d Her friend tried to cheer her up. \u201cYou\u2019re going to Rome,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYou\u2019ll meet a gladiator!\u201d But Kacie knew what she had with Dario wasn\u2019t replaceable. \u201cWe never stopped talking. We FaceTimed every single day,\u201d she says. This continued when Kacie was back in the US. And before long, Dario was planning a trip to visit New York. A New York minute On December 8, 2018 Dario arrived in the US. Kacie spent a week introducing Dario to her life in New York. \u201cIt was really cool to see it through his eyes,\u201d she says. \u201cShe showed me the real city,\u201d says Dario. Then the couple flew to Miami for a week\u2019s vacation. For Kacie and Dario, there was never a specific moment where they decided to embark on a relationship. \u201cIt was never a decision to be made,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cIt just went without saying,\u201d agrees Dario. \u201cBut I can\u2019t hide it, long distance was hard.\u201d The two struggled with time zones and their busy jobs that left them with little downtime, but tried to visit each other whenever they could. Cut to September 2019. Dario was back in New York visiting Kacie. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I move here?\u201d he suggested. He\u2019d loved the vibrancy of the city from the get-go and could see himself there. The restaurant scene was incredible. If he could find a job and organize the visa, it seemed like the ideal scenario. Kacie thought so too, so Dario started asking around. He was eventually hired as a chef at an Italian restaurant in Brooklyn. After a couple of months in limbo, his visa was approved. \u201cUp until that point, every time that we had to say goodbye it was borderline traumatic \u2013 we had spent this week together and we knew that this was it for each other,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cSaying goodbye in airports sucked. It would take like a week to recover.\u201d But now the airport goodbyes were consigned to the past. \u201cIt was really exciting,\u201d says Dario. Moving forward together Kacie and Dario spent three months in New York together, giddy with happiness to be in the same country and the same city. Then the pandemic hit. New York City\u2019s performing arts and restaurant industries ground to a halt. Stuck at home, Kacie and Dario found solace and support in one another. As Kacie puts it, she and Dario found \u201cmany silver linings\u201d in this tough time. Dario taught Kacie how to make pasta. They cat-sat. They spent long evenings chatting. But as 2020 rolled on, the couple were aware there was a deadline hanging over them. Dario\u2019s visa was set to run out in December and in the wake of the pandemic, renewal was out of the question. For Kacie and Dario, it seemed like there were only three viable choices: return to long distance, get married or move to Italy. Going back to long distance would mean the return of those airport goodbyes, the last thing either of them wanted. And while Kacie and Dario thought marriage was in their future, they didn\u2019t feel it was right for them at that point. That left moving to Italy. Kacie thought about her career in New York. Performing was off the table and there was no return date in sight. And while her friends were regularly posting on social media about how much they missed dancing, Kacie only felt \u201crelief\u201d that her days were no longer defined by auditioning and uncertainty. \u201cThat was a pretty big wake-up call,\u201d she says. \u201cI had gotten to a point where I needed to take a little step back from performing.\u201d On top of this, Kacie\u2019s New York apartment lease was up. If there was ever a time to relocate to Italy, it was now. \u201cEverything kind of fell into place,\u201d she says. Kacie researched online and found a language academy in Florence offering study visas. She applied, enrolling in Italian lessons. Then, Kacie and Dario packed up their life in New York and got ready to move across the Atlantic. Before stepping on the plane in January 2021, Kacie posted a video to TikTok about meeting Dario and the move to Italy. She\u2019d never posted much on the platform before, but felt inspired to mark this significant life step. When she stepped off the plane and connected to Wi-Fi, her cell phone was blowing up. \u201cIt went viral,\u201d says Kacie. While stuck inside during mandatory two-week quarantine, Kacie continued posting TikTok videos. Her following continued to grow. While her social media presence was getting bigger, for the first few months in Florence, Kacie and Dario\u2019s IRL world remained small. Italy was still in the thrall of Covid, with strict restrictions. But as Kacie studied for her Italian lessons and taught English online and Dario looked for restaurant work, Florence started to slowly reopen. \u201cI remember the first time going to the Duomo. And there was nobody there,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cWhich is crazy, because it\u2019s like the main focus point of Florence. And there\u2019s nobody in the piazza and I remember how bizarre that was.\u201d While that moment was surreal \u2013 even sad \u2013 Kacie and Dario still felt grateful to be at the Florentine landmark together. They\u2019d come a long way, and they were excited for their new life together in Italy. Acclimatizing to Italian life was made easier for Kacie by Dario\u2019s family, who welcomed her wholeheartedly \u2013 even if, in the early days, Kacie struggled with Italian and Dario\u2019s mother didn\u2019t know much English. The two women made communication work by using Google Translate on their cell phones. \u201cThey bonded immediately,\u201d says Dario. Kacie continued to post on social media, and her following ballooned. After about six months, she stopped teaching English online and decided to do social media full time. Dario encouraged this step. \u201cI think it was a really good idea diving into it,\u201d he says today. \u201cIt was the right moment, the right time, and I believed in her from the first moment.\u201d A life together in Italy Almost four years later, Kacie\u2019s expanded her social media presence into a travel company, running group tours around Italy and publishing her own travel guides. Meanwhile, Dario is still passionate about cooking and now works as a fine dining chef at a Florence restaurant. \u201cI really love the life we\u2019ve created here,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cWe live in a beautiful place with great food and he\u2019s got so many awesome things going for him and same with me.\u201d The couple encourage each other in their respective careers and endeavors, but they also savor their downtime. They love living in Florence and exploring Italy together. Dario and Kacie are settled in Florence for now, although they don\u2019t rule out a move elsewhere in the future. \u201cWe\u2019re enjoying the moment,\u201d says Dario. \u201cThe solid thing is the fact that we know we\u2019re in it together. And that\u2019s what makes it so great,\u201d says Kacie. She tells Dario: \u201cI\u2019m not nervous for what the future holds. Because I\u2019ve got you.\u201d Looking back, Kacie finds it serendipitous and surreal to think her spontaneous decision to travel solo in Italy led her to find a new career, a new home and the love of her life. \u201cThere were so many things that had to happen for it to actually happen, but it just felt normal and natural \u2013 like of course this is right and this was supposed to happen,\u201d she says. \u201cYou never really know what life has planned for you. There\u2019s so many good things waiting. You just have to trust it,\u201d adds Kacie. \u201cTrust in the process. And the path that is meant for you will happen, even if it\u2019s not the path that you intended to take for yourself.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/article/chance-encounters-florence-italy-kacie-rose/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_travel_city-most-expensive-expats-mercer-2024", "text": "Uprooting your life and moving to a completely different city for work isn\u2019t always an easy decision. There are many factors to consider, with cost undoubtedly high on the list. But which international city is the most expensive in the world for expats to move to? Hong Kong has once again taken the title of most costly city for overseas workers in the 2024 Mercer Cost of Living Survey, which was released Monday. The Asian city, which also topped the annual list in 2022 and 2023, was closely followed by Singapore, in second place. Much of the rest of the top 10 was taken up by Swiss cities, with Zurich, Geneva, Basel and Bern coming in third, fourth, fifth and sixth place respectively. Rising housing costs The report examined 226 cities based on the comparative cost of over 200 items in each location, including transportation, food, clothing, household goods and entertainment. New York was the highest US city, taking seventh place, while UK capital London, which was in\u00a017th place last year, jumped to eighth place. Nassau, The Bahamas took ninth place, with Los Angeles rounding out the top 10. According to the report, expensive housing markets and increased costs for transportation, goods and services are among the reasons why the cost of living in the top ranking cities is particularly high. \u201cThe cost of housing is a major factor in the Cost of Living City Ranking,\u201d reads the study, pointing out that employees who spend a significant slice of their income on rent or mortgages will have \u201cless disposable income for other expenses.\u201d \u201cBetween 2023 and 2024, there was a lot of volatility in this cost around the world, with housing rental prices varying significantly between cities.\u201d Additionally, \u201cinflation and exchange-rate fluctuations\u201d were noted to have directly impacted the \u201cpay and savings\u201d of international workers. At 92, Toronto was ranked as the most expensive city in Canada for international employees, followed by Vancouver at 101. Financial impacts While the top of the list changed little from the previous year\u2019s rankings, there were some considerably big jumps further down. Among them were Mexico\u2019s Mexico City and Monterrey, with the former moving up 46 places to number 33, and the latter climbing 40 places to 115. The study also noted that the cost of living in the US was \u201ca significant issue\u201d for 2024, with seven US cities appearing in the top 20. \u201cAs US-based companies continue to source talent globally, inflationary pressures may give some inbound foreign nationals pause to accept a position in some of the high-cost cities and metro areas in the US,\u201d says Vince Cordova, partner and mobility advisory leader at Mercer US. \u201cTherefore, we believe employers should be open about sharing the cost of living and net pay information with prospective staff so they can better understand the financial impacts of relocating to the US, and make a fully informed decision on whether or not to move ahead.\u201d The cities that ranked the lowest for living costs were Pakistan\u2019s Islamabad and Nigeria\u2019s Lagos and Abuja. However, this was said to be partly driven by \u201ccurrency depreciations.\u201d The price of a dozen large eggs, a liter of olive oil and an espresso coffee at a popular caf\u00e9 were among the 200 products taken into consideration when determining the rankings for the cost of living in each of the cities. According to the study, the price of olive oil was the most notable hike on average. \u201cCost-of-living challenges have had a significant impact on multinational organizations and their employees,\u201d\u00a0Yvonne Traber, Mercer\u2019s global mobility leader, said in a statement. \u201cIt is important for organizations to stay informed about cost-of-living trends and inflation rates and seek input from employees on these issues to effectively manage their effects.\u201d 2024 cost of living city ranking 1.

{"id": "travel_ukraine-kyiv-tourists-chernobyl-conflict", "text": "Before Russia invaded Ukraine, visitors from abroad frequently travelled to see Chernobyl, the nuclear power station that disastrously went into meltdown in 1986. After the release of the HBO series \u201cChernobyl\u201d in 2019, record numbers of visitors poured into the exclusion zone around the abandoned city of Pripyat, which housed the plant\u2019s workers, according to official numbers. Back then, President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree to pave the way for more tourists. New land, water and air routes were planned. Museums were being developed. A new modern hotel was on its way. Up to one million tourists a year were expected by 2025. Then the war started and everything changed. Russia attacked and Chernobyl, for a while, became the frontline as Russian troops occupied the exclusion zone, destroyed infrastructure and dug trenches in the radioactive dirt of the infamous Red Forest where dying trees turned the color of rust after being contaminated by fallout. The area is now de-occupied but active fighting continues along the frontlines. For the most part, only official delegations and military personnel currently have access to the exclusion zone. But even as fighting rages in the south, east and north of Ukraine, travellers are still heading to the country, drawn by scars from the ravages of war that are still fresh. In Horenka, a suburb northwest of Kyiv, gray apartment buildings stand deserted and broken windows and damage from Russian shells are a common sight \u2013 a legacy of some of the worst Russian atrocities during the early days of the war. Coming to the area was once unthinkable. But it has now become one of the stops of tours through the towns in Kyiv region that show visitors the devastation and the horrors of war, as they learn more about what happened here from those still living through it. \u201cWe were very much against such tours in the first months of the de-occupation, in the first year of the de-occupation,\u201d said Mariana Oleskiv, head of Ukraine\u2019s State Agency for Tourism Development. \u201cIt was a rather traumatic experience for all the residents.\u201d \u201cBut now we are already seeing a significant change. People are ready for the world to know about the heroism of Ukrainians, on the one hand, and the crimes of the Russians, on the other,\u201d she said. Among those who have gone on such tours are members of international organizations, volunteers, diplomats, people involved in reconstruction efforts and anyone who wants to witness what unfolded here. Jean-Baptiste Laborde, a French student from Bordeaux, is also following the route. He\u2019s accompanied by Svitozar Moiseiv, a guide and co-founder of a travel company behind some of the tours. \u201cI\u2019ve been following events since the war began,\u201d Laborde said. \u201cSo I wanted to see for myself what happened there, the destructions, the Russian occupation.\u201d The journey begins Laborde and Moiseiv start their tour in Horenka. Standing not too far from one of the dilapidated apartment buildings, its entrance covered in red tape, its yard being inspected by a demining team and its innards exposed by bombardment, Moiseiv tells how Russian soldiers arrived here on February 24, 2022, and moved on to the big cities, including the capital. He describes what happened in the nearby villages of Horenka, Bucha, Irpin and Borodianka. The story is suddenly interrupted by a resident who hid in the basement of the building in the early days of the war. Ivan Bilotserkivets\u2019 apartment was destroyed but he and all his neighbors were unharmed. The pensioner recounts how they watched Russian helicopters attempting to land at Hostomel airport, just a few kilometers away. He says locals were sure the violence would end in a few days. But the reality is that the full-scale war is now well into its third year. \u201cIn general, I have a positive view of the fact that people from all over the world come to see our house and the consequences of the war,\u201d Bilotserkivets says. \u201cIt affects their perception of the war when people see the destruction with their own eyes.\u201d From his pocket, he pulls out a drone photo of his home taken just days after it was hit and shows it to Moiseiv and Laborde. \u201cIt is painful when you have worked all your life and done everything in your apartment, and now there are only ashes left,\u201d he says. \u201cAll our belongings were destroyed in one blow.\u201d Bilotserkivets says he has spoken with many of the visitors. \u201cThey come and ask: tell me what happened here and how. Of course, I share our experience. There were people from the United States, Brazil, Portugal, from many countries.\u201d For the locals, the most urgent issue is the restoration of their homes. Hopes of which were raised \u2013 then dashed \u2013 when world-famous graffiti artist Banksy arrived to paint a mural on one of the walls. \u201cBanksy came here several times, and we served him borsch and donuts,\u201d Bilotserkivets says. \u201cWe thought that this would somehow contribute to faster reconstruction. But because of his drawings, the opposite happened. Now we are waiting for a decision on what to do with them, whether they will be dismantled.\u201d The reconstruction can\u2019t start before that decision is made, he said. \u2018Endless cemetery\u2019 A few hundred meters away is another location of the tour, which links the history of Kyiv\u2019s defence against the Nazi army during World War II and the story of a Ukrainian family\u2019s survival during the Russian invasion in 2022. Moiseiv shows Laborde a section of a concrete fortification that was part of the Soviet army\u2019s defences in the 1940s. Almost 80 years later, the crude concrete structure became a shelter for a family for two weeks during heavy shelling when they would only break cover to run back to their house for food, water or candles. Laborde enters the fortifications to experience the conditions in which the family lived. Moiseiv tells Laborde what happened in each of the settlements, how the landscape affected the Russian offensive. The Ukrainian army blew up bridges to stop the Russian advance, he explains, but that made it difficult for people to evacuate quickly as the invading army approached. \u201cFrankly speaking, it is extremely unpleasant and difficult for me to actually be here every time I come here. Because, relatively speaking, we are moving through an endless cemetery,\u201d Moiseiv says. \u201cNow we are driving along Yablunska Street, where more than 70 civilians were killed. We will stop at the memorial to the shooting of young men. From a psychological point of view, this is a difficult process,\u201d he says as the tour reaches Bucha, a town that has come to symbolize Russian atrocities around Kyiv. Moiseiv says he tries to show human suffering in a personalized way on his tours \u2013 damaged houses, holes in the fences of residents. \u201cWe know their names and we know what they did during the hostilities.\u201d \u201cSuch tours are especially needed so that Europe and the whole world can help us more now, so that we can survive this cruel and absolutely inhuman struggle,\u201d he says. Among the locations of the tour is also the Church of St Andrew in Bucha, where more than 100 bodies of civilians were buried in a single mass grave and then exhumed after the liberation of the town. Now there is a memorial at the gravesite. There are fresh flowers near some of the names, as relatives of the victims come to honor the memory of their loved ones. Laborde stops to read the names. Immersive tour Yulia Bevzenko has also been conducting tours in Kyiv for Ukrainians and foreigners for 10 years. Among her clients since the war began have been famous film stars and directors, politicians, foreign ambassadors and volunteers. She developed her \u201cKyiv is not Kiev\u201d route to show how the capital lives during the war. \u201cThe tour is not about entertainment, it is an immersive tour,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not trying to distract their attention from the war. We are trying to immerse them in it.\u201d Before the start of the war Bevzenko ran about four tours for visitors per week. In 2022, she gave four or five tours in English during the entire year, and the guests were not tourists in the true sense of the word. \u201cMy clients during the war, a full-scale war, were people who cannot be called tourists now, because they are representatives of companies that come to help Ukraine, they come here for different reasons,\u201d she said. Moiseiv, the tour guide travelling with the French student, also said pure tourism was almost non-existent after the start of the war, but in 2023 about 100 people visited Bucha with him. Oleskiv, Head of the State Agency for Tourism Development, said too \u201cthat tourism for classical purposes\u201d is very rare. Bevzenko says visiting Bucha and Irpin is an emotional but also educational experience \u2013 for both foreigners and Ukrainians. \u201cThese are not excursions,\u201d she says. The information needs to be presented carefully, accurately and \u201cwith respect, with honor, with an understanding that there is a war going on.\u201d Visitors in Kyiv see the National Guard and military personnel in the streets. Bevzenko takes them to a wall with thousands of photos of fallen soldiers. She shows them the city\u2019s largest medical hub. Petra Schr\u00f6ckeneder, a volunteer from Austria who has been helping house Ukrainians in her home city of Salzburg since the first days of the invasion, went on one of Bevzenko\u2019s tours. \u201cNow I can really understand the pain Ukrainians have every day in their life and how strong they are as a nation,\u201d she says. Some of the locations that touched her the most were the destroyed Irpin bridge, around which people tried to escape to Kyiv from occupied towns like Bucha. Some were shot by the Russians. She also saw graves and the destroyed houses in Bucha. \u201cHearing about it and seeing it are very different things,\u201d said Schr\u00f6ckeneder, who hosted Ukrainian children who had trouble reaching their parents still in the midst of conflict. \u201cI saw the pain,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you see it yourself, I cannot describe how different it is.\u201d \u201cMy mind could not process how many people already died fighting this war,\u201d Schr\u00f6ckeneder said. \u201cUkraine is still protecting Europe with being so strong. And I think it\u2019s very important for other people from Europe to see this.\u201d While many countries, including the US, currently warn against all travel to Ukraine, it seems that a willingness to discover the realities of the conflict, continues to draw visitors across its borders. And with an eye on a post-war future, Mariana Oleskiv, the head of the State Agency for Tourism Development, says she hopes travelers will one day be able to return to Chernobyl. But, she adds, Ukraine\u2019s recent experiences of conflict must remain at the heart of any travel experience. \u201cIt will also contain a part of the new history, including the defense of the Kyiv region, the trenches that (the Russians) dug in the ground contaminated with radiation.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/ukraine-kyiv-tourists-chernobyl-conflict/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "travel"}}

{"id": "travel_chance-encounters-airplane-romance-airport-kiss", "text": "Amy Osmun assumed she\u2019d never see Mike Gilberstadt again. They\u2019d met only 10 hours before. Now they were standing in Amsterdam\u2019s Schiphol Airport, facing one another, both putting off the farewells. But time was ticking. They were both set to catch connecting flights \u2013 Amy to Scotland, Mike to Greece. \u201cI guess we have to say goodbye,\u201d said Amy, reluctantly. In a gesture of farewell, Mike leaned in to hug Amy. He kissed her, briefly, on the cheek. Then Mike readied to leave, adjusting the bag on his shoulder. He was about to turn away when Amy spoke: \u201cIs that all I\u2019m going to get?\u201d she said, smiling. Even as she said it, Amy knew this was a moment she\u2019d remember. \u201cThat\u2019s when he gave me a real kiss,\u201d Amy tells CNN Travel today. \u201cIt was absolutely electric.\u201d For a moment, Amy and Mike stood, kissing, amid the crowds of travelers at the airport. And then it really was time to say goodbye. Mike took Amy\u2019s number, writing down her details on a scrap of paper. Then they went in different directions. As Amy walked away from Mike, she tried to make sense of what had just happened. She never usually spoke to strangers while traveling, let alone kissed them. And she couldn\u2019t figure out how her airport embrace with Mike fit into the wider context of her life. Was Mike just a stranger she\u2019d quickly forget? Would this become a funny story someday? Would she always wonder what could have been? Or would she look back and feel sadness, regret? As Amy lined up at her gate, she tried to shake herself out of her reverie and swipe Mike from her mind. After all, she wasn\u2019t just traveling to Scotland for a vacation \u2014 she was visiting someone. And not just anyone: her boyfriend. Mike couldn\u2019t be someone, Amy told herself, because she already had her someone. An airplane encounter Amy and Mike met on March 23, 2006, on an airplane about to depart Los Angeles International Airport. Back then, Amy was a 24-year-old trainee dietician at California State University, flying to Scotland for spring break. She\u2019d ended up with the middle seat \u2013 an unenviable prospect for a long-haul flight. But while there was someone sitting next to Amy by the window, there was no one sitting in the aisle seat. \u201cIt looked like I had an empty seat next to me for the long-haul flight \u2013 so I was pretty excited,\u201d Amy recalls today.\u00a0 \u201cAnd then I swear, right before the plane doors closed, he came sauntering down the aisle.\u201d \u201cHe\u201d, of course, was Mike \u2014 who is, by his own admission, \u201cnot a punctual man.\u201d He was the last person to board the plane, and he bounced into the empty seat next to Amy, who couldn\u2019t help but roll her eyes. \u201cI was not impressed in the moment, as I faced a 10-hour flight squished in a middle seat,\u201d Amy recalls. But then Mike apologized \u2013 half jokingly, half sincere \u2013 for ruining Amy\u2019s flight. And then, noting her eye mask and travel neck pillow already wrapped around her head, Mike \u2013 half jokingly, half sincere \u2013 offered Amy his shoulder to sleep on instead. Amy smiled despite herself. Later, once they were in the air, when Amy\u2019s food choice arrived and looked less-than-edible, Mike insisted she help herself to his meal tray. As she picked food off his plate, Mike and Amy started chatting \u2013 realizing they were a similar age, both living in Southern California, both interested in travel. Amy thought Mike was funny and self-assured \u2013 and while she noted he tried to mask it under his jokes and bravado, he seemed kind. Feeling comfortable in his presence \u2013 and desperate to sleep \u2013 Amy accepted Mike\u2019s offer of sleeping on his shoulder. Several hours later, Mike and Amy landed in Amsterdam. As they disembarked the airplane, Mike suggested they grab a coffee together. First in the coffee line, and later as they walked through the airport, Amy and Mike continued chatting. Amy noted how easy conversation was \u2013 even though they barely knew one another and were both bleary-eyed from the overnight flight. And then, somehow, they ended up kissing in the middle of Amsterdam Schipol Airport. \u201cI thought I\u2019d never see him again,\u201d says Amy. \u201cSo I was like, \u2018Why not go out there a little bit?\u2019\u201d From long haul to phone calls As for Mike, he\u2019d liked Amy from the moment she scowled at him, eye mask perched on her head, as he boarded the plane at LAX. Throughout his time in Greece, Mike regularly replayed the airport kiss in his mind, hoping he\u2019d see Amy again, wondering if and when he should get in touch. Meanwhile Amy was enduring a \u201cdisastrous\u201d visit with her long-distance boyfriend. She left Scotland single. The break-up wasn\u2019t really anything to do with Mike, says Amy today. She just realized this particular guy wasn\u2019t right for her. Back in California, Amy returned to her classes and doubled down on her studies. From time to time, Amy\u2019s thoughts drifted to Mike \u2013 on their immediate rapport, on the airport kiss \u2013 but when he unexpectedly phoned her one day and asked her out, Amy said no. She was still reeling from her break-up and didn\u2019t want to jump into anything new too quickly. But over the next several weeks, Mike kept calling. Soon, Amy and Mike were chatting on the phone for hours at a time. Mike\u2019s roommates teased him about these lengthy calls, but Mike laughed off their jokes. He enjoyed talking to Amy, and she liked talking to him too. \u201cMike was still just as charming as he was on the plane and at the airport,\u201d says Amy. \u201cSo I finally took him up, and we went on our first date.\u201d That first evening, Amy and Mike met up for sushi and then went for a walk on the beach which turned into Mike giving Amy a piggyback ride. They collapsed onto the sand, laughing. Later, back at Mike\u2019s apartment, Amy marveled at the fact Mike\u2019s television set had TiVo \u2013 a recording device that allows viewers to record live television to watch later. Right away, Amy wrote down a list of her favorite TV shows and asked Mike if he could record them on her behalf. Amy was genuinely excited at this prospect \u2013 but it was also a bit of a ruse: if Mike was recording Amy\u2019s favorite TV shows, she\u2019d definitely be returning to watch them. A week or so later, Amy and Mike enjoyed their second date at the themed dinner entertainment venue Medieval Times. Afterward, back at Mike\u2019s apartment, they caught glimpses of distant fireworks illuminating the skies at Disneyland. Over the next weeks, Amy and Mike continued meeting up regularly. \u201cA month or so in I had met his parents,\u201d recalls Amy. This felt especially significant because Amy had never met her previous boyfriend\u2019s family or friends. There were other signs that Mike was in it for the long haul. \u201cHe let slip that he had told a friend that he thought he was going to marry me,\u201d recalls Amy. Nevertheless, Amy worried her happiness with Mike had an enddate. She was set to leave the US for the UK for several months as part of her dietetics degree. Amy worried her new relationship wouldn\u2019t survive this distance, and she debated what to do, eventually ending things with Mike before she left for the UK. Or, possibly, Mike ended things with Amy. \u201cHe still maintains that he was the one that broke up with me, but I distinctly recall having a conversation with a friend just before about if I should break up with him,\u201d says Amy. The truth was both Amy and Mike were concerned about the impact of long distance on their fledgling relationship. Mike didn\u2019t want Amy to leave, but Amy wasn\u2019t going to abandon a great career opportunity. They both \u2013 reluctantly \u2013 came to the conclusion the relationship must have run its course. \u201cSo we broke up,\u201d says Amy. \u201cBut we stayed in touch.\u201d Staying in touch As soon as Amy left, Mike was flooded with regret. He found himself wishing he could have gone to the UK with her, and he thought about her often. Amy missed Mike too. They kept up to date on one another\u2019s lives via email and the occasional phone call. Social media was still in its infancy back then, so Mike also resorted to old school methods, sending heartfelt cards to Amy across the Atlantic. Today, Mike jokes that this \u201cnever happened.\u201d He\u2019s not generally prone to putting pen to paper, and rarely sends cards to anyone on any occasion. But Amy has the proof \u2013 she kept all Mike\u2019s long distance correspondence, including a Valentine\u2019s Day card sent to her in February 2007. \u201cIt was fate I met you,\u201d reads Mike\u2019s message in the card. \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t tied to Orange County, I would follow you anywhere. But most of all I wish you all the happiness in the world. You\u2019ll always be my Valentine.\u201d Not long after Amy returned home to California that spring, she reunited with Mike. They picked a pointedly non-romantic spot for the reunion: Target, in San Diego. Amy was shopping with a friend of hers, and Mike came along too. The group walked around, browsing, laughing and joking. \u201cIt was one of those Targets with two floors,\u201d recalls Amy. \u201cSo you have a cart elevator \u2013 I was super excited about that.\u201d Amy was also excited to see Mike again. And it was clear he felt the same way. The two kept stealing glances across the Target aisle. Within days, Mike and Amy were a couple again. Moving forward From then on, Amy and Mike\u2019s relationship was unwavering and solid. \u201cOnce we got back together, we were together,\u201d is how Mike puts it. Amy finished her studies and started working as a dietician in a hospital. She and Mike moved in together. Then, in late 2007, Amy and Mike went on a trip to Ireland and Italy. While on a stopover in Venice, Mike asked Amy to marry him. \u201cWe get in that gondola and then under the Rialto Bridge he popped down on his knee on the gondola and proposed,\u201d Amy recalls. She wasn\u2019t expecting the proposal at all, but Amy was thrilled, and said yes immediately. \u201cIt was a fun surprise,\u201d says Amy. \u201cAnd we got to spend the rest of the trip engaged, which was fun.\u201d Amy remembers excitedly phoning her parents and sister, discovering Mike had let them know his intentions before the trip. They were thrilled for her too. Back home in the US, Mike and Amy started planning their wedding for the following year. That\u2019s when they realized their parents shared a wedding anniversary: November 1. As a nod to that coincidence, Amy and Mike got married on November 2, 2008. Amy took Mike\u2019s name, becoming Amy Gilberstadt. During their ceremony, Amy and Mike toasted their parents\u2019 long marriages and their own future. The heartfelt speeches from friends and family also included several references to Amy and Mike\u2019s cinematic airplane meeting. Right after their wedding, Amy and Mike boarded another plane together \u2013 traveling to Hong Kong and then India for their honeymoon. \u201cWe had a lot of fun,\u201d says Amy of the trip. This kickstarted a pattern \u2013 each year, Amy and Mike committed to two big vacations a year. They\u2019ve since traveled to destinations including Japan, China, Australia, New Zealand and Tahiti. \u201cEven when our son was born, he was only six months old and we were in the United Kingdom for a trip,\u201d recalls Amy. Amy and Mike welcomed their son in 2010. They were both delighted to become parents. \u201cI\u2019d always wanted children \u2013 I wanted to have a son and named him after me, which I\u2019ve done, so that they could know my pain of having their calls answered and their mail opened,\u201d says Mike, laughing. Mike and Amy later welcomed a daughter in 2013. The couple describe their two kids as \u201cpretty darn fabulous.\u201d Over the years, Amy and Mike have enjoyed watching one another find their footing as parents. \u201cI can keep the play dates, the organizational stuff going. But I was not, and I\u2019m still not, very good at playing,\u201d says Amy to Mike. \u201cYou\u2019re really good at that. I would give myself about five minutes of playing Barbies and I was like, \u2018I\u2019ve got to go do something else.\u2019 And you could be up there for ages with our daughter.\u201d \u201cWe had a whole world going on,\u201d says Mike of his years playing Barbies with his daughter. In recent years, Amy and Mike have also supported each other through tougher times. In 2020, Amy\u2019s aunt passed away suddenly and her mother became extremely ill with Covid-19. That same year, Mike\u2019s mother was diagnosed with lung cancer. \u201cThat was a really tough time,\u201d says Amy. She and Mike rallied together around their loved ones and \u201csurvived loss and illness,\u201d as Amy puts it. \u201cWe\u2019re still going strong,\u201d she says. Going strong Today, Amy and Mike are focused on family, travel and adventures. The Gilberstadts recently headed to Alaska to catch the Northern Lights and then on to Vermont to see April\u2019s solar eclipse. \u201cI had never seen a total solar eclipse before. So I wasn\u2019t expecting much from that. But that was way more amazing than I thought it would be,\u201d says Mike. \u201cIt was quite a celestial trip.\u201d \u201cWe had a blast,\u201d says Amy. Later this year, Amy and Mike hope to take their kids to Japan \u2013 an 11 hour plus flight from LAX. Amy and Mike joke that they still operate on long haul flights very similarly to how they did on that first flight over 18 years ago: Amy tries everything and anything to get some sleep, while Mike will always offer her his shoulder or lap. The main difference is Amy and Mike have since perfected \u201cplaying with travel points,\u201d as Mike puts it, and like to travel in the premier cabins if they can. And they always avoid the middle seat \u2013 even though it\u2019s what brought them together all those years ago. Today, Amy and Mike look back on their first meeting with a mix of joy, surprise and gratitude. For Amy, it makes her a little \u201cteary-eyed\u201d as she puts it, to reflect on their random meeting and everything they\u2019ve been through since. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d she says. As for Mike, he possibly said it best in one of his other rare forays into card writing \u2013 on Amy\u2019s first Mother\u2019s Day in 2010: \u201cWho would\u2019ve thought all these things would happen,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHopping on that flight to Greece was the best and most rewarding thing I have ever done.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/chance-encounters-airplane-romance-airport-kiss/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "travel"}}

More than 85% will be going by auto. At least the Covid-19 pandemic is just a dusty blip in the rear-view mirror. \u201cWe anticipate this July 4th\u00a0week will be the busiest ever with an additional 5.7 million people traveling compared to 2019,\u201d said Paula Twidale, senior vice president of AAA Travel.

Transportation mishaps and misdeeds We\u2019ve seen another rough go of it lately as people tried to move from Point A to Point B. A power cut led to delays and disruptions at one of the United Kingdom\u2019s busiest airports.

{"id": "2024_06_27_travel_gotene-sweden-land-sale-krona", "text": "You\u2019ve heard of houses on sale in southern Europe for the price of a cup of coffee. Now one country in northern Europe is running a similar scheme: selling plots for just a few cents. G\u00f6tene, 200 miles southwest of Stockholm, is selling 29 plots of land with prices starting at just 1 krona, or 9 US cents, per square meter (11 square feet). This isn\u2019t just any land, though. It\u2019s land on which the lucky buyers can build their dream home \u2013 to live in, or as a holiday home, as the rules currently stand. So if the heat wave is making southern Europe seem less attractive by the day, this might just be the ticket. G\u00f6tene, a rural area with 5,000 residents living in the main town, and 13,000 in the wider municipality, is rural Sweden at its finest. It\u2019s located on the shores of Lake V\u00e4nern, not only Sweden\u2019s largest lake but also the biggest in Scandinavia and the entire EU, at around 10 times the size of Lake Constance. Only Russia has larger lakes on the European continent. For hikers, G\u00f6tene also has a small mountain nearby \u2013 Kinnekulle. It\u2019s also home to two UNESCO-rated sites: the Plat\u00e5bergens Geopark and Lake V\u00e4nern Archipelago and Mount Kinnekulle Biosphere. So why would such an idyllic town need to stage a fire sale of its land? \u2018It\u2019s become a sensation\u2019 Mayor Johan M\u00e5nsson says it\u2019s a combination of the current economic downturn and dwindling rural populations. \u201dThe housing market is currently very slow in our region and Sweden in general because of high interest rates and a bit of a recession, so we wanted to give an injection into the market,\u201d he told CNN. \u201dWe\u2019re also seeing low birth rates and an ageing population so we have to do something, bring more people here.\u201d M\u00e5nsson said they decided to sell off 30 plots for a token fee, choosing land that had been \u201don the market for many many years\u201d without selling. \u201dWe thought why not, it\u2019s an extraordinary situation that requires extraordinary measures. So we did it, and now it\u2019s become a sensation, I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d The scheme launched last month with about 30 interested buyers, said M\u00e5nsson. Four of them bought plots at the one krona per square meter price. Plot size ranged from 700-1,200 square meters. Since then, he says, things have spiraled. \u201dIt went viral and we\u2019ve had thousands and thousands of requests to our telephone exchange,\u201d he said. \u201dWe have two people in our phone exchange in city hall and they have been very sweaty over the past few days. We\u2019re basically in crisis mode.\u201d Because of the unprecedented request \u2013 M\u00e5nsson says there have been calls from all over the world \u2013 the authorities have paused the bidding process until early August to work out how to proceed. When it restarts, it\u2019s likely that there will be a bidding process for the land, rather than selling it for just 1 krona per square meter (the lower price applies only if nobody else wants the land). M\u00e5nsson says that building a house usually costs around 3 to 4 million krona, or $280,000-$375,000. Plots of land usually cost around 500,000 krona, or $47,000. So far, anyone can buy a plot \u2013 they don\u2019t have to be resident in Sweden, or commit to living there permanently. But the town may have to revisit the rules, he said. And of course, building a house doesn\u2019t give you the right to live in it full time. Visa rules are down to the government. The town\u2019s only requirement is that building of the house starts within two years of buying the plot. Cheap houses on the horizon The \u00a0G\u00f6tene fire sale doesn\u2019t end with these 30 plots. M\u00e5nsson said it\u2019s \u201dnot impossible\u201d that they might do some kind of cheap housing scheme similar to the \u201done euro\u201d houses that rural communities in Italy are famous for. \u201dWe have a lot more land, and we\u2019ll have to sit down and see if we can do something to make something more of it other than just these 30 plots. We need something to offer the callers,\u201d he said. In fact, it might even be a turning point for the remote community. \u201cThis was basically a bit of a stunt \u2013 we thought we\u2019d be lucky to sell one or two,\u201d he says. \u201cWith the interest we\u2019re seeing now, it\u2019d be fantastic if we sold all 30. \u201cWe\u2019ve been at a very steady 13,000 inhabitants for several decades. If this goes well\u2026. \u201cIf you\u2019re seeking a quiet life in the country, we can bring you a high quality of life. It\u2019s the perfect match.\u201d There\u2019s just one question: how to pronounce G\u00f6tene? It\u2019s Yeur-te-neh, says M\u00e5nsson.

The National Park Office of Mount Halla has started a campaign to encourage hikers not to dump ramyun broth on the mountain or in its streams in order to preserve a \u201cclean environment,\u201d according to a press release. Mount Halla, measuring 1,947 meters (1.2 miles) tall, is the country\u2019s highest mountain and located on popular vacation destination Jeju Island. In South Korea, it\u2019s trendy for hikers to bring ramyun \u2013 a type of instant noodles served in a disposable cup \u2013 along with them to eat during the day. Banners put up around the mountain read \u201clet\u2019s preserve the clean Mount Halla and pass it on to descendants as it is,\u201d with signs urging the hikers to use only half of the instant soup and water. Smoking, leaving food and trash, unauthorized entry and drinking are prohibited at the mountain, and those who violate the rules can face penalties of up to 2,000,000 won ($1,442.15). \u201cRamen broth contains a lot of salt, so discarding it along the valley\u2019s water stream makes it impossible for aquatic insects to live in contaminated water,\u201d the National Park Office wrote in a Facebook post. Jeju police reportedly conducted a brief crackdown on June 25, following repeated complaints from residents concerning tourist behavior on the island. Visitors can be ticketed or fined for actions including littering, public urination and smoking in designated no-smoking areas. According to the Jeju police, nine foreign tourists were given tickets and fines (which they had to pay on the spot) on the first day of the new controls, mostly for jaywalking. The fine for crossing the street anywhere other than a marked pedestrian crossing is 20,000 won ($14.50), and for crossing at a red light it goes up to 60,000 won ($43.40). Mount Halla is part of the UNESCO-listed Jeju Volcanic Island and Lava Tubes heritage site. Last year, 923,680 people visited the mountain, according to government statistics. And the hot-noodles-on-high-peaks trend is now expanding beyond South Korea.

Barounis opened The Auction House in New York\u2019s Upper East Side in 1993, he knew he wanted to deter a certain type of customer in their early 20s \u2014 in his words, \u201cthose kids that had their flannel shirts tied around their waists, wearing their Villanova hats backwards, walking around in the street with their Amstel Light in their hand.\u201d He deliberately cultivated an atmosphere at his bar that he felt might intimidate a fresh-out-of-college 20-something: rich velvet drapes, crystal chandeliers, antique furniture. On Fridays and Saturdays, the message was more explicit: Only patrons 25 and up were allowed in the door. \u201cI didn\u2019t need a 21-year-old to come in with two of his friends, to make a ruckus and then get sick in the bathroom,\u201d Barounis says. Barounis says his age policy was rare back then, and some at the time questioned his decision to keep out younger customers. Three decades later, the bar is something of an institution \u2014 and the 25-and-up policy on weekends was so well-received that he implemented it at his sister bar, The Back Room. Today, plenty of bars and lounges around the US impose similar \u2014 if not stricter \u2014 age restrictions, hoping to curb unruly behavior sometimes exhibited by newly legal drinkers and appeal to an older crowd. But such age limits are still unusual at restaurants, as evidenced by the recent controversy around a Missouri eatery. Bliss, an upscale Caribbean restaurant that opened last month in the suburbs of St. Louis, provoked numerous headlines and fervent debate for limiting entry to women 30 and up and men 35 and up. As Barounis sees it, the uproar over the restaurant\u2019s age policy suggests it might have been too extreme. \u201cThe difference between 21 and 25 is greater than 25 and 35,\u201d he says. \u201cWhere do you draw the line?\u201d How the owner of Bliss chooses to run his business is, of course, his prerogative, Barounis and others in the hospitality industry say. But the conversation around the restaurant\u2019s unconventional age policy raises some interesting questions: To what extent can businesses dictate who their customers are? And to what extent should they? Plenty of customers appreciate age restrictions Generally, society seems to have reached a tacit (if begrudging) acceptance of age restrictions at certain establishments. Bars like Barounis\u2019 Auction House have long operated without issue, catering to customers seeking a night out without potential disruptions from patrons who haven\u2019t yet learned how to handle their liquor. Some restaurants have seen increased reservations and sales after instituting bans on young children. And adults-only hotels and resorts are popular for a reason. In fact, Bliss owner Marvin Pate tells CNN his positive dining experiences at adults-only resorts are what inspired his restaurant\u2019s age policy. He and his wife Tina Pate, both 42, found that there was a demand among people their age for an elevated spot where they could kick back, relax and hear the music they grew up listening to. \u201cWhy not just make a lounge type of feel at a resort but in a restaurant setting?\u201d Pate says of his thinking behind Bliss. \u201cMajority of (places) around the country, if you go to a place that\u2019s 35 and up, it\u2019s actually a lounge with fried food. We thought about the concept of a restaurant that\u2019s daily, where people could \u2026 get a luxe environment and just enjoy themselves with actual cooked food.\u201d Judging by the comments on the Bliss Facebook page, many customers welcome the laid-back, mature environment that Bliss promises. Several people urged the restaurant not to backtrack on its age policy despite the criticism it has received, while a few joked that they wouldn\u2019t take issue with an even higher age limit. Still, some in the comments objected to the idea that age was a reliable proxy for maturity level. Others questioned whether Bliss\u2019 stringent policy of carding people at the door was necessary to achieve the sophisticated ambiance that Pate envisioned. Would 20-somethings even want to hang out in a place where a majority of the clientele is in its 30s and 40s? \u201cAn age restriction for a restaurant is a bit of a reach unless it\u2019s a bar and event space too IMO,\u201d one commenter said. \u201cIf they want to deter disruptive crowds it\u2019s better to raise the price range not the age range.\u201d However objectionable some patrons find these age restrictions, such policies don\u2019t generally constitute age discrimination, says Trey Lindley, a civil litigator in North Carolina with the business law firm Lord & Lindley. Businesses generally have the right to set their own guidelines for service, as long as it isn\u2019t on the basis of federally protected categories such as race, religion, national origin or disability, according to Lindley. Think of the \u201cno shirts, no shoes, no service\u201d signs that proliferated in the early 1970s or Covid-era mask mandates. Though federal law prohibits age discrimination within the context of employment, Lindley notes that age isn\u2019t typically a protected characteristic when it comes to federal and state laws banning discrimination in public places. Provided that an establishment has a logical reason for its rules and enforces them uniformly, he says it generally has the right to do so. \u201cI think the biggest concern for restaurants who want to do this is potential blowback,\u201d he adds. Different age policies for men and women raise questions When bars or restaurants institute age requirements, it inevitably elicits some grumbling from those who feel excluded. Just last month, Donerick\u2019s Pub in the suburbs of Columbus, Ohio, made headlines for raising its age limit to 30 and older on Fridays and Saturdays. And each time a restaurant announces a policy restricting children, it inspires intense debate across social media. While there seemed to be a few people who were upset that Bliss implemented age restrictions at all, some of the criticism focused on the fact that the rules are different for men and women. Bliss defended its policy of allowing women 30-plus and men 35-plus, writing in a May Facebook post that it intends to create a \u201cgrown and sexy atmosphere\u201d and helps to \u201cmaintain a sophisticated environment, uphold our standards, and support the sustainability of our unique ambiance.\u201d Pate says the restaurant initially planned to institute a 35-and-up policy for both men and women, but lowered the threshold for women to cater to what he called \u201cladies night out\u201d \u2014 referring to young professional women gathering with female friends for happy hours and other social events. The five-year gap struck some customers as arbitrary, with some women who met the age requirements expressing frustration that they couldn\u2019t visit Bliss with their male partners. \u201cWhy can I come at age 30, but my husband who will be 33 this year can\u2019t?\u201d one user commented on a Facebook post from Bliss. \u201cAssuming that all young people are going to cause problems is cutting out a huge crowd of people who would bring in more business.\u201d \u201cMay I ask why the men have to be older than the women? I would love to be able to come with my fianc\u00e9 (who\u2019s older than me), but he\u2019s not 35 for 2 more years,\u201d another person wrote. Bliss\u2019 age discrepancy may be especially stark, but separate policies for men and women aren\u2019t unheard of among bars and nightclubs. Barounis, for example, recalled working at a bar in Long Island decades ago that barred women under 23 and men under 25. And for years, bars and nightclubs enticed both male and female customers by offering discounted or free drinks for women. Even if Bliss\u2019 rules likely don\u2019t constitute age discrimination, Lindley says the gender discrepancy could open the restaurant to litigation. But Pate maintains that the policies at Bliss aren\u2019t intended to discriminate against anyone. He says the goal is simply to provide a relaxing atmosphere for older customers and adds that he didn\u2019t think the restrictions were out of the norm. Experts say age-exclusive establishments are unlikely to become a trend Though restaurant and bar owners can generally set their own rules on who they allow in, hospitality industry experts that spoke to CNN are doubtful that age-exclusive establishments will become a trend. Excluding patrons under 35 or 30 omits an otherwise desirable slice of the market, says Jason Kaplan, CEO of the restaurant consulting firm JK Consulting. While bars may be able to get away with higher age restrictions, he says he wouldn\u2019t recommend such a strict policy for restaurants given that profit margins on food are much lower. Younger generations tend to spend more money on drinking and eating out, and Kaplan says it\u2019s unlikely that most businesses would want to give that up. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about that sweet spot between young professionals that you\u2019re basically going to eliminate, who are willing to pay for experiences,\u201d Kaplan says. Eddie Fahmy, CEO of A2Z Restaurant Consulting, agrees. He understands why a bar might impose age limits only on certain days, but to him, shutting out a younger demographic entirely is a risky business decision. \u201cIf you\u2019re a restaurant and you want to make money selling food and serving customers, it just doesn\u2019t make sense to me,\u201d he adds. But other establishments with strict age policies say the business model works for them. Toya Taylor, owner of the San Antonio-based 30-plus lounge Horizons & More, says she knows she\u2019s probably losing some business by barring people under 30, but she also feels that doing so reduces her liability. \u201cThe places that are starting (to use age restrictions) are going to see good results, especially if they stick to it,\u201d she adds. Meanwhile, Barounis notes that the buzz generated over Bliss\u2019 age requirements could work in its favor, and he\u2019s eager to see whether the restaurant finds success with its unusual policy or whether it ultimately reverses course. Pate, Bliss\u2019 owner, says he\u2019s not going anywhere. And when those younger customers finally turn 30 or 35, Bliss will be there, waiting to welcome them in. \u201cI feel like we have (filled) a big void that was needed inside American society and just the culture in general,\u201d he adds. \u201cPeople were asking for this, and we just gave the people what they want.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/travel/restaurants-bars-age-restrictions-bliss-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_article_breakfast-tacos-origins-mexico-texas", "text": "Two simple words can spark mouth-watering bliss or a series of blistering retorts in Texans: Breakfast tacos. In the Lone Star State, who gets the credit for these morning tortilla sensations can be a matter of haba\u00f1ero-hot debate. A highly contested Eater article in 2016 helped start a full-on Breakfast Taco War between Austin and San Antonio. While that particular battle eventually settled down, flare-ups continue. But to get a true picture of this simple food with a complex history, we must go beyond Texas and first look at another place: Mexico. Mouthwatering tacos in Monterrey The breakfast taco is actually part of a long parade of foods (pizza, for instance) whose fuzzy origins and various claims of authenticity spark ferocious debate. There\u2019s one thing we know for darn sure: Today, breakfast tacos are enjoyed on both sides of the Rio Grande River. In her CNN \u201cSearching for Mexico\u201d series, actor Eva Longoria traveled to Monterrey in the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n.     There, she enjoyed a breakfast taco with Mexican food bloggers Gerardo Alvarado and Ernesto Esquivel at Tacos Do\u00f1a Mary La Gritona, which has been serving central Monterrey for nearly 20 years.  \u201cThe breakfast taco may be the simplest of street food, but it\u2019s been been hitting the spot for the workers of Monterrey for nearly a century,\u201d narrates Longoria. \u2018Not a junkie food\u2019   CNN Travel caught up with Esquivel \u2013 born and raised in the border state of Sonora and resident of Monterrey for more than 10 years \u2013 to find out more. \u201cWhen I arrived in Monterrey, I discovered all the different types of tacos that everyone eats in the morning. You can have a taco of eggs. You can have a taco of meat. You can have a taco of potatoes.\u201d Esquivel describes breakfast tacos as \u201ca really fast food, but not a junkie food.\u201d  Esquivel said you can find breakfast tacos in other states in northern Mexico, but Monterrey and the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n are the culinary epicenter with more places to get them and a larger selection of fillings.  Some of the city\u2019s favorites are the machacado (dried beef) with eggs, the barbacoa (slow-cooked meat, often in a pit) and the deshebrada (shredded beef). In other words, you\u2019re in meat country. Timeline of the breakfast taco Esquivel said the breakfast taco goes back to the early 1900s and perhaps even earlier in Monterrey.  Compa\u00f1ia Fundidora, a former iron and steel foundry that dates to 1900 but is now a recreational and educational park, helped the breakfast taco get its start in Monterrey. Employees came \u201cto work really early, and so they had to have a really fast breakfast in the morning, and one fast breakfast in the morning is a breakfast taco.\u201d  And from there, the tacos spread into southern Texas, Esquivel said, which is reflected in the cuisine of today. \u201cI think the flavors here in Monterrey, mostly in the north, are similar to some flavors in Texas.\u201d Along with Do\u00f1a Mary\u2019s, he suggests these spots for a breakfast taco if you\u2019re in Monterrey: Tacos Rafa Ahogados, Tacos Piedra and Tony\u2019s Tacos. North of the Rio Grande   The river may mark a political line between two nations, but it has been no barrier at all to crossings of cuisine and culture. And Texas also shares a passion for the breakfast taco. You can tell that just from all the kerfuffles about them. \u201cNo Texas city can claim the breakfast taco,\u201d says Jos\u00e9 Ralat, the taco editor of Texas Monthly magazine. He places the ultimate credit south of the Rio Grande. \u201cIt comes from Mexico \u2013 where exactly, it\u2019s not really known. Geographically, the most likely source is northern Mexico. There is no literature that I have seen that can point to any particular city in northern Mexico.\u201d As for today, \u201cthey\u2019re popular in [the Mexican states of] Tamaulipas, Nuevo Le\u00f3n and Coahuila, which all border Texas,\u201d he said. Eddie Vega \u2013 who grew up in McAllen, across from the Mexican city of Reynosa in Tamaulipas state \u2013 is known as \u201cTaco Poet of Texas.\u201d He points out that historically, what\u2019s now south Texas was once part of Mexico.  Before 1836, \u201cthe border was further north. All this region was eating a combination of indigenous and Spanish food together.\u201d Vega said that growing up, breakfast tacos weren\u2019t some trendy food to him attracting attention from the likes of The New York Times and other coastal media. \u201cWhen you get to south Texas, and I\u2019m from the Valley, we had breakfast tacos, but they were in my house. My mom would make them. It\u2019s not something we\u2019d go to a restaurant to get because economically that region is very poor and nobody\u2019s eating out. Or not eating out in the morning especially.\u201d Enter Austin Ralat and Vega both said the breakfast taco was staple deep in south Texas and then San Antonio long before Austin got in on the action. So how did Austin become so synonymous with them? Austin has \u201ca great branding mentality, they have a knack for PR. Every year, Austin is flooded with coastal elites checking out South by Southwest,\u201d Ralat said. \u201cThey try some options, and then in their minds, they think it\u2019s an Austin thing. My job is to question the stuff \u2026 and let history speak for itself.\u201d  Ralat said San Antonio has \u201ca bit of an inferiority complex that they\u2019re often overlooked to the benefit of Austin when San Antonio is older, has more culture, it\u2019s more diverse, and the food is better.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, they\u2019re both Tex Mex towns, and breakfast tacos are Tex Mex. But they\u2019re also border food. When the Eater article came out\u201d \u2013 championing Austin as \u201chome\u201d of the breakfast taco \u2013 \u201cSan Antonians lost their minds.\u201d   Vega said the culinary history is too distant for any one place to stamp itself as originator or king purveyor. \u201cI don\u2019t know that one city \u2013 San Antonio, Corpus Christi, McAllen, Brownsville or Laredo \u2013 can claim it. You have differences with them because of ingredients.\u201d Movin\u2019 on Jessica Elizarraras, a Rio Grande Valley native and the executive producer for MySA.com, said many people have put the origins dispute behind them. \u201cI think at this point we\u2019ve mostly moved on from the great taco war of 2016,\u201d Elizarraras said in an email interview with CNN Travel. \u201cIs there occasional ribbing? Absolutely! Are there great tacos across the state? 1000 percent. The Mexican diaspora is far-reaching and so are their tacos.\u201d She cites a 2016 article by Gustavo Arellano as a detailed settlement of the issue that effectively shows Austin is not the start of the breakfast taco.  She also points out the regional differences within Texas. \u201cA flour tortilla in San Antonio tends to lean a bit puffier than its Rio Grande Valley/Coast counterparts. Con Huevos Tacos in San Antonio is the best of both worlds: a thin but sturdy tortilla, filled with fun, flavorful combinations.\u201d They\u2019ve gone nationwide   Ralat said he\u2019s now seeing breakfast tacos coast to coast. He was also recently in Nashville and saw them offered there.  \u201cI hesitate to eat them at a place that calls them Austin-style. \u2026 I want the food to be high quality. I don\u2019t want it to be spin.\u201d  Elizarraras suggests people just enjoy them \u2013 with or without huevos (eggs).  \u201cBreakfast tacos are ephemeral as they come, which makes them that much more magical,\u201d she said. \u201cBean and cheese is a great example of a breakfast taco that doesn\u2019t have eggs. \u2026 Chicharron en salsa (verde or rojo) is another example of a tasty taco that doesn\u2019t require eggs. Barbacoa \u2013 made using a whole cow-head, and more generally, beef cheeks \u2013 is a classic breakfast taco in San Antonio, often paired with Big Red [soda] for a Sunday morning treat.\u201d  The joy of it all In the end, why does the origin of a type of food even matter? \u201cPart of the issue is erasure. Just like with anything else in our Mexican-American culture, to feel left out of a conversation when you know you\u2019ve part of that conversation for a long time.\u201d Vega said. And back south of the Rio Grande, they are a source of unity, Esquivel said.  \u201cI think the breakfast tacos here in Monterrey \u2026 and the northeast of the country is something that unites everyone.\u201d  They\u2019re popular with the poor, the middle class and the rich, he said. \u201cThe place can be ugly. The place can be like in the streets. But you will see people in suits there eating breakfast tacos.\u201d  For Ralat, breakfast tacos are much more than a great way to start the morning. \u201cI think history, especially food history, is important to know because it provides another mirror for our culture. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to me that tortillas are the foundation of Mexican culture, and to break bread with someone is a sacred act. So let\u2019s take it literally, and say that you share tacos with someone else. That\u2019s so nice. And it\u2019s just so joyful.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/article/breakfast-tacos-origins-mexico-texas/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_four-seasons-gresham-palace-budapest-hotel", "text": "For most of the last century, the story of the Gresham Palace closely mirrored that of the city in which it was built. Built at the turn of the 20th century in prosperous Budapest, it quickly became the Hungarian capital\u2019s hottest address. After enduring two world wars, it suffered neglect under communism before rising majestically, once again, in June 2004 to become one of the city\u2019s, perhaps even central Europe\u2019s, grandest hotels. This summer, the building \u2013 one of the finest examples of Art Nouveau design in Budapest \u2013 is celebrating two decades in its most recent incarnation, as the Four Seasons Gresham Palace, a luxury hotel with panoramic views of the mighty Danube river. The anniversary marks a new milestone in the preservation of this architectural gem that was both ahead of its time when it was built and very much a celebration of the intellectual golden age in which it emerged. The Gresham Palace was conceived around the time that Budapest emerged as one of Europe\u2019s largest cities after the 19th-century unification of affluent Buda on one side of the Danube with rapidly developing Pest on the other, and the absorption of nearby town \u00d3buda. At the time, the Chain Bridge was the main link across the river, and so it was decided to build the palace on the Pest side to act as a kind of bricks-and-mortar gatekeeper. \u201cAfter the unification of Buda, Pest and \u00d3buda in 1873, Budapest became a big cosmopolitan city, a European capital,\u201d J\u00f3zsef Laszlovszky, director of the cultural heritage studies program at Central European University, tells CNN. \u201cBuda and Pest, for a long time, were only connected by the Chain Bridge, thus Sz\u00e9chenyi Square at the end of the bridge on the Pest side was one of the most prominent public spaces with Gresham Palace overlooking them both.\u201d Passionate affair Widely adored today, Gresham\u2019s construction in 1906 was also a story of affection \u2013 it\u2019s also known locally as the \u201cpalace of hearts.\u201d Heart motifs carved into the building were said to be added by the architect, Zsigmond Quittner, because of his love for a future tenant of the palace. Another more probable tale says the hearts were inspired by a passionate affair between Countess Irma Sz\u00e9chenyi and Thomas Gresham, an Englishman behind the building\u2019s construction. Gresham was said to have gifted Sz\u00e9chenyi a heart-shaped pendant which she asked to be woven into the fabric of the palace. Quittner, who won a commission from the Gresham Life Assurance Company, to build the palace, delivered, along with the help of his associate J\u00f3zsef V\u00e1g\u00f3, a prime example of Art Nouveau architecture, infused with the avant-garde flair of Vienna and Paris of that era. It was built to reflect the grandeur of the powerful Austro-Hungarian empire at the time, with lavish interiors and detailed ironwork. Renowned glass-painter and mosaic-maker Miksa Ro\u0301th was also brought in to create ornate exterior glass mosaics and stained glass windows. The palace was not only an architectural triumph but also a hub of technological innovation, featuring central heating and a pioneering dust extraction system. The building also boasted a T-shaped shopping arcade with a glass roof, a novel concept in Budapest in the early 1900s. Upon its completion, Gresham Palace instantly became Budapest\u2019s most sought-after address \u2013 as a place to live for the wealthy, and somewhere to shop and be seen in the exclusive boutiques and cafes on the ground floor. Throughout its history, the palace served Budapest as a cultural hotspot, housing the famous Gresham-Venezia Caf\u00e9 and the P\u00f3dium Cabaret, known for its satirical and sometimes politically daring performances. However, the Soviets\u2019 siege of Budapest in 1944 left the building heavily damaged, and subsequent nationalization under communist rule in 1948 led to further decline. Influential artists \u201cGresham Palace and its coffee house were famous among artists and collectors,\u201d says Laszlovszky. \u201cThe so-called Gresham-circle was an informal, but very important, artistic meeting place before World War II. \u201cMembers of the circle, like R\u00f3bert Ber\u00e9ny, P\u00e1l P\u00e1tzay, B\u00e9ni Ferenczy, J\u00f3zsef Egry, Istv\u00e1n Sz\u0151nyi were painters or sculptors, the best artists of the period. Interestingly, they followed different artistic trends, but they were all influential people in the art life of the period.\u201d Despite suffering during wartime and enduring decades of neglect, the palace\u2019s spirit seemed to survive intact until 2001, when luxury hotel group Four Seasons embarked on an ambitious three-year project to restore the building\u2019s original splendor while integrating modern luxuries. A team of leading Hungarian architects, interior designers and craftsmen was assembled for the project. Architect Gabor Kruppa was responsible for the complete reconstruction of the palace, alongside restoration artist Mikl\u00f3s Szenkir\u00e1lyi. \u201cIt took thousands and thousands of hours for a unique team of highly trained masters from a variety of trades to cut this magnificent, Art Nouveau gem into a brilliant jewel,\u201d Szenkir\u00e1lyi said at the time. \u201cThe Gresham Palace has been born again in wonderful unity, serving as a crown jewel of outstanding beauty that complements our magnificent Chain Bridge.\u201d \u2018Extraordinary history\u2019 Since its reopening in 2004, the Four Seasons Hotel Gresham Palace has provided visitors with a well-appointed sanctuary, offering 179 rooms and suites with panoramic views of the Danube or the cityscape. Its interiors, from the grand lobby to the spa atop, exude a regal air. \u201cGresham Palace is one of Budapest\u2019s most iconic buildings, and today, through its mere existence, unique location, and architecture, it shapes the image that the city presents to any tourist wishing to explore it,\u201d Thibaut Drege, the hotel\u2019s general Manager, tells CNN Travel. \u201cThe fact that Four Seasons was able, 20 years ago, to renovate such a jewel reflects the extraordinary history that this building has undergone since its creation. Ultimately, it is this architecture that reflects an era when Budapest held a prominent position as a destination for high society Europeans. The city is now reclaiming this position, with growing interest notably from high-end travelers.\u201d As well as luxurious accommodation, guests and visitors of the hotel can also enjoy some of Budapest\u2019s top dining and relaxation spots. These include KOLL\u00c1ZS, a contemporary French brasserie which offers what\u2019s arguably the grandest setting in Budapest. The venue serves local Tokaji wines, artisan cocktails and a menu crafted by Executive Chef \u00c1rp\u00e1d Gy\u0151rffy, one of the finalists at the prestigious Bocuse d\u2019Or Hungary competition. The hotel\u2019s MU\u0301ZSA bar also offers artisan cocktails plus Asian food in a setting designed to transport visitors to Budapest\u2019s golden age. The venue also has a cultural program with ballet evenings and live performances. In a city renowned for its thermal baths, there\u2019s inevitably also a luxurious spa, offering steam rooms, a relaxation pool and a \u201cHungarian Moor Mud\u201d treatment, that\u2019s said to be popular with Hollywood A-listers.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/four-seasons-gresham-palace-budapest-hotel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_avoid-stupid-american-stereotype-traveling-abroad", "text": "If you watch shows such as \u201cEmily in Paris,\u201d you can be forgiven for thinking the world is enchanted by Americans who travel abroad. Silly gaffes, like mistaking a public urinal for a monument and taking selfies in front of it, come across as charming quirks on television. However, as a single American woman who moved to Europe and made a LOT of faux pas of my own, I can assure you that the real world is definitely not amused. It\u2019s a hard pill to swallow, but sadly, we\u2019ve gained a reputation around the world for being, well, \u201cstupid Americans.\u201d Is it offensive? Yes. Could we get upset about it? Sure. But with tens of millions of Americans traveling abroad every year, the likelihood is that you\u2019ll encounter us wherever you are in the world. Therefore, our reputation is completely understandable. The reality is, we ALL do \u201cstupid\u201d things, especially when we are in foreign places and we don\u2019t know the local customs, cultures or surroundings. No one is immune from this humiliation, not even genius scholars. However, smart travelers know that doing \u201cstupid\u201d things abroad can not only be disrespectful and embarrassing, but it can put you at risk of being arrested, hurt or the victim of crime. That\u2019s why, instead of letting labels upset me, I choose to focus on how I can become a master traveler. After 20-plus years of exploring the world, I think I\u2019ve managed to crack it. So, here are my top 10 tips on how you can avoid the \u201cstupid American\u201d stereotype and become a \u201cSmart American\u201d abroad. Read social cues People in most countries are extremely polite. They would never tell you that what you are doing is offensive or socially unacceptable. Instead, they will most likely smile and nod, before quickly changing the topic, running away or ghosting you. This behavior definitely makes for a very civilized society, but if you\u2019re a tell-it-like-it-is New Yorker like me, it can be very hard to pick up on social cues. For years, I foolishly thought that what I was saying or doing was of genuine interest to those around me. I had no idea that I was embarrassing myself and chasing people away. As you meet people abroad, try to notice if they are genuinely interested (for example, asking lots of follow-up questions, making eye contact, building on your stories, asking to join in, etc.), or if they are just being polite. If your Spidey sense starts to tingle, it\u2019s probably time to change the subject or move on to a new activity. Keep the volume down It is very true that most Americans have a wonderful zest for life. We don\u2019t think twice about gabbing away with friends (or strangers) on public transportation or laughing whole-heartedly at the dinner table. That\u2019s just our way of being friendly. However, in many places around the world, speaking loudly is considered extremely rude and highly uncommon. It\u2019s not unusual to visit major cities and see people traveling in complete silence while on a packed train. You\u2019ll also notice that you can\u2019t hear the conversation at the table sitting directly next to you in a restaurant. When I first moved to Europe, people would regularly ask, \u201cWhy are you shouting?\u201d I was always shocked. I was just using my normal speaking voice! I didn\u2019t think I was being loud at all. Turns out, I was indeed shouting, at least relative to everyone else around me (imagine how traumatized they\u2019d all be if I did actually shout.). Over the years, I\u2019ve learned to become more aware of my surroundings and to control my volume level accordingly. It\u2019s a skill I will always struggle with, as my default level is apparently a nine out of 10 to most, but it\u2019s also a skill that has had a major positive impact on my business, romantic and personal relationships. Don\u2019t get me wrong, when I\u2019m home in New York, I let it all out and no one even notices. However, when I\u2019m traveling abroad, I\u2019m always careful to keep it to, what feels like, a quiet whisper. Blend in Normally, I\u2019m all for originality and standing out in a crowd. However, when you\u2019re traveling abroad, even to a place you know well, standing out is like wearing a flashing sign that says, \u201cI\u2019m a tourist, come take advantage of me!\u201d Whether it\u2019s pickpockets, grifters or someone more nefarious, there are always bad actors lurking about, looking for fresh prey. Unfortunately, criminals can often spot an American a mile away by either their accent (another reason to keep the volume of your voice down) or their fashion (khakis, golf shirts, sneakers, baseball hats and white socks are usually dead giveaways.) The moment these predators know you\u2019re from out of town, they will pounce. That\u2019s why it\u2019s smart to blend in with the locals and avoid drawing any sort of attention to yourself. Not only will it make you a smart American, it\u2019ll also make you a safer American.\u00a0 Be curious No one likes a know-it-all. That\u2019s why one of the best ways to win people over and skyrocket your knowledge is to be curious. Be a sponge and absorb as much new information as possible. Being genuinely interested in a country, its people, its culture and everyday life is one of the most flattering ways to show respect and connect with a community. Judge Judy always says, \u201cYou have two ears and one mouth for a reason.\u201d In other words, listen twice as much as you talk. \u00a0If you can listen without feeling the need to talk about \u201chow we do things back home\u201d or show off all the things you read in a book, then you will make friends everywhere you go. In fact, the more questions you can ask, the more people will think you\u2019re intelligent! No one expects you to know everything. It\u2019s attractive when you can say, \u201cI don\u2019t know about this, please tell me more.\u201d It shows humility and opens the door for others to share their wisdom and stories with you, which will always help you grow. So, try to forget everything you know, open your mind and be curious. If you do, people will respond with kindness, appreciation and believe that you are very wise. Be street smart Every city has its own scams, and it\u2019s important for you to read up on what the most common scams are in the area you\u2019re visiting before you travel so that you can be street smart. One of the most popular scams is when a taxi driver takes the \u201clong way\u201d to get you to your destination, racking up quite the bill. Not every city has Uber. Local taxi drivers instantly know whether you\u2019re from the area or not, simply by the way you make your request when you enter their vehicle. When I traveled to Rome for the first time, I got into a cab and asked the driver, \u201cHow much to get to this hotel?\u201d He replied \u201c80 euros.\u201d I immediately told him to stop. I removed my bags, which made him very angry, and exited his car. I then called the hotel and asked, the same question. They told me it would be no more than 5 euros. The next taxi I entered, I told the driver, \u201cPlease take me to this hotel. It\u2019s just down the road so should only be around 5 euros, right?\u201d He replied, \u201cYes,\u201d and we were on our way. By letting him know I wasn\u2019t a \u201cstupid American,\u201d we were all able to live happily ever after. The point of this story is do your homework. Get an idea of prices for taxis, food, charges, tipping, etc., ahead of time so you don\u2019t get ripped off or taken advantage of. Know the local scams and know how to reject people who approach you with their games. And most of all, don\u2019t let your excitement to be in a new place lure you into a false sense of security.\u00a0 Be careful about meeting new people, especially from dating apps. Stranger danger is real. Read the news America is so vast that the news tends to focus on what\u2019s going on locally in each state, with a touch of what\u2019s happening across the rest of the country. However, it rarely features international news. As a result, many Americans often have little to no knowledge of what\u2019s going on around the world, thus unfairly adding to the \u201cstupid American\u201d stereotype. Luckily, there is a fast and easy remedy. If you\u2019re planning to travel abroad, simply read the news headlines of the country you\u2019re visiting before you travel. You don\u2019t need to know the country\u2019s full history, but it will help tremendously if you know the basics: Who is the current president / prime minister of the country? What are the hot topics and major headlines? What is the country\u2019s national sport and how is their team doing? Where is the country located on a map, and what countries surround it? Having this information available at your fingertips will not only make you look well-informed, it will help you avoid being left out of conversations. Learn some of the language Do you need to be fluent when you go abroad? Not at all. Do you need to learn the basics? Yes. Absolutely. Most major cities will have plenty of English speakers, but they won\u2019t always be around when you need them. Whether it\u2019s an emergency or just being able to order from a menu, it\u2019s important for you to know some basic words and phrases to get you through the day. I recommend you start with: \u201cHello,\u201d \u201cGoodbye,\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d \u201cPlease\u201d, \u201cHelp,\u201d \u201cSorry,\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t speak ___,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m allergic to ___,\u201d \u201cI would like to go to ____,\u201d \u201cWhere is ___\u201d and a smattering of your favorite foods. Sure, there are apps that can help, but memorizing these phrases will go a long way, not just with communication but also with cooperation. Even if you butcher the words, most people deeply appreciate it when you at least try to speak the local language. It shows respect that you made the effort, and you\u2019ll be surprised at how many doors it can unlock for you. Be an ambassador In many ways, we are all mini-ambassadors of the United States when traveling abroad. For better or worse, how we act will directly reflect, not just on us, but on all Americans. Yet, there\u2019s something in human nature that makes many people act differently when traveling abroad. It\u2019s as if something snaps inside their brains and, suddenly, they become this completely different person who can do and say things they would never consider doing in their daily lives. As you can imagine, this can lead to some bad situations (I\u2019m talking to you, Americans who were arrested for sleeping in the Eiffel Tower). While it might be tempting to take on a \u201cWhat happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas\u201d attitude when traveling abroad, I recommend you think of travel as if you are a sporting fan who is going to see your favorite team at an away game. You are a guest in their house. You can\u2019t expect the other team to have the same food, entertainment, transportation and hospitality. Your support for your team can be an automatic insult to the host team (even if you don\u2019t intend it to be insulting), and if you don\u2019t follow the rules, you\u2019re going to get kicked out of the stadium. But what brings us all together is that we all share a love of the sport. \u00a0It\u2019s the same with travel. Remember, you are a guest. Like any good visitor, you want to make sure you make a positive impression so that you are always welcomed back. Don\u2019t pack a lot of underwear One of the funniest stories I\u2019ve ever heard came from a friend who is a Swedish trumpet player. He roomed with an American while on tour. He said, the man opened his luggage and exposed over 50 pairs of underwear. The trumpet player asked, \u201cWhy have you packed so many pairs of underwear for a two-week tour?\u201d The musician replied, \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if you had washing machines in Europe.\u201d Stories like this are amusing to us, but my friend was beside himself. Do Americans really think that Europe is backward? Well, apparently, some do. If you\u2019re traveling abroad, you may be surprised to know that many countries are far more advanced that the United States in some areas. For example, there has been a high-speed 200 mph train connecting London to Paris since 1994. Yet, America still doesn\u2019t have a high-speed train network of its own. Britain and most of Europe has been using contactless card payments for everything from dining to transport since 2007. Gothenburg, Sweden, is so safe that companies display actual products in front of billboards, and no one steals the items. The list goes on.\u00a0The point here is, for most travel, you won\u2019t need to pack 50 pairs of underwear. Beat them to the punch with humor My biggest secret weapon against being called a \u201cstupid American\u201d is calling myself a \u201cstupid American\u201d first and laughing about it. Let me explain. As I said above, I accept that everyone does stupid things, and I am no exception. I\u2019ve done a LOT of really \u201cstupid\u201d things when traveling in the past, and I\u2019m sure I will do plenty more \u201cstupid\u201d things in the future. That\u2019s OK! I know in my heart that I\u2019m not actually a \u201cstupid\u201d person. So, instead of getting offended or upset about it, I just laugh and get others to laugh with me. For example, whenever I don\u2019t understand something, I\u2019m confident enough to say, \u201cSorry, I know I\u2019m being a stupid American here, but could you help me with this?\u201d I find this approach instantly disarms people. Instead of becoming frustrated, it makes them eager to help. Instead of driving a wedge between our cultures, it brings us closer together. By beating them to the punch and stating the phrase \u201cstupid American\u201d before they even have a chance to think it, it flips the script and delivers a bit of reverse psychology that makes people think and say, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not stupid. I\u2019m happy to help you.\u201d At the very least they will laugh with you, not at you. Don\u2019t believe me?\u00a0 Notice how I used this same technique with you at the beginning of this article. Believe me. Implement this tip and no one will ever roll their eyes or doubt your intelligence ever again.

{"id": "2024_06_24_travel_japanese-hotel-accused-canceling-israeli-guest-reservation-war-crimes-hnk", "text": "A hotel in the Japanese city of Kyoto allegedly canceled an Israeli tourist\u2019s reservation because of \u201cwar crimes,\u201d drawing criticism from local officials who said it violated regulations. The tourist received a Whatsapp message from an employee at the popular destination\u2019s Hotel Material telling him the booking scheduled for June had been canceled in response to the conflict in Gaza, according to the Israeli Embassy in Tokyo. One message, confirmed to CNN, is said to have read: \u201cWe are sorry to inform you that, due to war crimes being committed by Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) members in the conflict taking place in Gaza between Israel and Palestine, we are not able to accept reservations from persons we believe might have ties to the Israeli army.\u201d It\u2019s unclear why the hotel employee believed the person had ties to the Israeli army. The traveler who received the Whatsapp messages made an initial complaint to the Israeli embassy in Tokyo. The person was able to make a new reservation at a different hotel in Kyoto and continued his trip as planned. The Embassy accused the hotel of \u201ca clear case of discrimination\u201d when the news of the alleged incident went viral last week. The hotel, which has not responded to multiple requests from CNN for comment, was also strongly reprimanded by Kyoto\u2019s city government, which accused it of breaching Japan\u2019s Hotel Business Act, which regulates the hospitality industry. \u201cOur position is to provide safe, secure, and high-quality accommodation for citizens and travelers, and we will respond strictly to situations that do not conform to this, such as this one,\u201d a representative for the Kyoto city government told CNN, adding that a city representative visited the hotel in person to inform them of the legal violation. \u2018Singular incident\u2019 Ido Bromberg, a political counselor at the Israeli Embassy, told CNN that the person who allegedly sent the Whatsapp messages was a low-level employee at the Hotel Material, not its general manager, owner or director. The Embassy has sent a formal complaint letter to the Japanese government, but Bromberg emphasized that there is no animosity between the two countries. \u201cWe know that this is not a characteristic of Japan in general or the hotel industry in Japan,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that the hospitality of Japanese hotels is excellent and extremely nice, so we hope that the hotel will take necessary measures to make sure this will not happen again, and with the specific employee.\u201d \u201cWe see this as a very singular incident, and we hope it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d Bromberg noted that there is a direct flight between Tokyo and Tel Aviv operated by Israel\u2019s national carrier El Al and says that Japan is a \u201cfavorable\u201d destination for Israeli tourists. The Israeli embassy says it would appreciate an apology from the hotel but will not pursue any legal action over the allegation. On October 7, 2023, Hamas militants entered Israel via Gaza, taking about 250 people hostage in a violent terror attack that killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that Israel was \u201cat war\u201d shortly afterward. Since then, more than 37,000 people have been killed in Gaza by Israeli military offensives, according to Gaza health authorities. A United Nations inquiry this month found that both Israel and Hamas have committed war crimes amid the war in Gaza.

{"id": "travel_article_eva-longoria-searching-for-mexico-restaurants", "text": "You\u2019ll no doubt be hungry after watching \u201cEva Longoria: Searching for Mexico.\u201d Every episode is full of mouthwatering regional specialties prepared by chefs all over the country. For those wanting to follow in Eva Longoria\u2019s footsteps, below is a guide to the restaurants and locations she visited. Veracruz: Cradle of Mexican gastronomy Longoria visits the coastal state of Veracuz. Its position along some 400 miles (645 kilometers) of the Caribbean Sea made it a focal point for military conflict \u2013 and the collision of food cultures. \u201cThe people of Veracruz took this treasure trove of ingredients passing in and out of the port and created a whole new cuisine,\u201d Longoria said. \u2022 Longoria met chef Erik Guerrero, who aims to make fishing more sustainable in Veracruz, at Namik restaurant, where they enjoyed ceviche with hot beans and soft shell crab taco. \u2022 Next up, she joined actor and friend Ana de la Reguera for some coffee at historic Caf\u00e9 La Parroquia, Veracruz Port. Tap on the glass three times to ring for milk. \u2022 She headed to the lush inland mountains to meet coffee farming expert Itzel Mendoza at Cafetal Privado en Coetzala to learn how the precious bean is grown. There, they gathered flowers in the fields to be added to chicken stew, a salsa and a palm flower fritter. \u2022 Back in Veracruz Port, she met food historian Nidia Hern\u00e1ndez Medel at Chuchumb\u00e9, a cultural center, to cook some fried yucca, which is traced back to the city\u2019s African slave era.  \u2022 It\u2019s back out of the city to meet with vanilla farmer Norma Gaya, of Gaya Vanilla and Spices, for some vanilla chicken. \u2022 At El Tajin ruins, a Totonac settlement, Longoria met cook Do\u00f1a Marta. She\u2019s the founder of Smoke Women, which keeps ancient Totonac traditions alive. They enjoyed alcamaya (fresh-water shrimp) stew and mushroom empanadas. \u2022  Chef Luis Palmeros, a rising star on the Mexican food scene, introduces Longoria to traditional cook Do\u00f1a Rocio at Cuarto Blanco Market in the inland city of Xalapa (the capital of Veracruz state), for a traditional stuffed jalape\u00f1o. He then takes Longoria to his restaurant, El Cuarto Blanco, for his modern take on the dish. Jalisco: Birthplace of traditions \u2022 At Tortas Ahogadas El Pr\u00edncipe Heredero in Guadalajara, Longoria samples a torta ahogada \u2013 the region\u2019s beloved \u201cdrowned\u201d sandwich. \u2022 In Guadalajara\u2019s Santa Teresita neighborhood, Longoria samples a new preparation of native ingredient chinchayote at Xokol, a restaurant run by chefs \u00d3scar Segundo and Xrysw Ruelas D\u00edaz. \u2022 Longoria attends a charreada, a Mexican rodeo, that takes place at Lienzo Charro Charros De Jalisco. Afterward, she sampled birria, the celebrated goat stew from Jalisco, at the clubhouse. \u2022 Chef Fabian Delgado Padilla treats Longoria to mole with pork belly at his restaurant palReal in Guadlajara\u2019s Colonia Americana neighborhood. \u2022 At Lake Chapala, about 30 miles south of Guadalajara, Longoria meets with members of one of the oldest indigenous groups in Mexico, the Coca people, to talk about their fight to preserve their way of life and history on the lake. They feast on local fish called charales. \u2022 Longoria meets friends Mariana Padilla and Alejandra Pelayo at traditional cantina La Iberia in Guadalajara. Women weren\u2019t allowed in cantinas until the 1980s, Longoria said. \u2022 Then she heads to to the town of Tequila, where Salvador Rosales Trejo shows her how tequila is produced by Tequila Cascahuin using traditional methods. \u2022 Longoria and chef Fabian Delgado Padilla visit Yunaites, his casual restaurant inside a municipal market in Guadalajara, for gorditas topped with pork and mole. Nuevo Le\u00f3n: Where beef is king Say adios to vegetables for a while. Nuevo Le\u00f3n is the land of meat. In this state in northeast Mexico, carne asada is a go-to meal. And it\u2019s the cuisine Longoria grew up with in Texas.  \u2022 In Monterrey, Longoria met up with Alejandro Guti\u00e9rrez, founder of the Mexican Society of Grill Masters, to try the region\u2019s specialty: carne asada (grilled meat). In August, there\u2019s a grill master competition in Santiago, outside of Monterrey. \u2022 Tacos Do\u00f1a Mary La Gritona has been serving breakfast tacos in Monterrey for nearly 20 years. \u201cThese are the best tortillas I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d said Longoria. \u2022 El Jonuco restaurant celebrates the products of Nuevo Le\u00f3n with a focus on seasonal ingredients. They\u2019re known for their cabrito (roasted goat). The restaurant celebrates the little-known history of crypto-Judaism in the region, Longoria said. \u2022 Dona Lupita\u2019s Caf\u00e9, located in the backyard of her home right next to Highway 85 south of Monterrey, is famed for its legendary tamales. \u2022 La Divinita bakery is one of the most successful bakery chains in Monterrey. The founder uses local oranges to make a traditional dessert with Longoria. \u2022 Koli restaurant, run by the three Rivera Rio brothers, is a fine dining restaurant that aims to tell the story of Nuevo Le\u00f3n. Oaxaca: A gastronomic capital Nestled within three vast mountain ranges, Oaxaca is a magnet for food lovers in the know.  A thrill of any visit here is sampling the moles, as well as dishes such as tlayudas (thin Oaxacan \u201cpizzas\u201d), spicy hot chocolate and asado grilled in smoky market stalls. \u201cIt is on another level gastronomically, one of the best places I\u2019ve been to in the world,\u201d Longoria said. \u2022 Mercado de Abastos is a giant market on the edge of Oaxaca City. If you want your chocolate fix, the mercado is still the place to come. This region is known for its moles \u2013 complex sauces featuring many blended ingredients.  \u2022 Casa Oaxaca makes Oaxaca\u2019s famous mole negro drizzled over turkey breast. Longoria called it a magnificently complex and sophisticated sauce. \u2022 At Las Quince Letras, chef Celia Flori\u00e1n made Longoria quesillo \u2013 a stretched Oaxacan cheese --  with crickets and edible flowers. \u2022 In the area of Oaxaca located on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, several muxes, who identify as a third gender and are guardians of Zapotecan cuisine, cooked up stuffed pork with pineapple served alongside pureed potatoes. Longoria called it \u201cthe perfect combination.\u201d \u2022 The farming town of Santa Ana Zegache is the unassuming epicenter of corn. Corn has been worshipped for over 6,000 years and is still the beating heart of Mexican cuisine.  \u2022 In San Baltazar Chichicapam, Longoria visited a palenque (agave farm) run by Do\u00f1a Berta, one of very few female mezcaleras. The farm produces mezcal, the smoky liquor for which this region is famed. \u2022 La Cocina de Humo is a hip restaurant using local ingredients. Chef Thalia Barrios Garc\u00eda is known for her heirloom tomato salad with beet puree and herbal dressing. Longoria said it\u2019s the \u201cperfect dish.\u201d Here\u2019s the recipe.   Yucat\u00e1n: Defined by the Maya Mayan DNA runs through the recipes in Yucat\u00e1n, which has the largest Maya population in Mexico.  The state is located along the Gulf of Mexico and is surrounded by dense forests that isolate it off from the rest of the country. The Maya thrived here for thousands of years before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors in the 1500s. The region\u2019s geography and turbulent history have had a significant impact on the cuisine. \u2022 Ixi\u2019im mixes modern and ancestral techniques and flavors. The restaurant has its own version of the most famous dish from the Yucat\u00e1n, cochinita pibil. Chef Luis Ronz\u00f3n slow-cooks pork underground after it\u2019s marinated in sour orange and spices.  \u2022 Condimentos Enrique is a family-run business that sells recados (spice pastes) in Mercado de Santiago in M\u00e9rida. \u2022 At Huniik, which means \u201cunique spirit\u201d in Maya, chef Roberto Sol\u00eds makes onion tempura with black recado. \u201cI have never had anything like this. This is gorgeous, and it\u2019s delicious,\u201d said Longoria.  \u2022 In his home in Xoc\u00e9n, chef Alberto Kuku prepared one of the oldest dishes, Mayan chicken tamales, for Hanal Pix\u00e1n, a holiday celebrated by the Maya people that means \u201cfood for the souls.\u201d The food honoring the dead \u201ccan easily be carried back to the underworld,\u201d he said. \u2022 Chef Regina Escalante, who runs Merci in M\u00e9rida, showed Longoria how to make grilled seabass with mango, avocado and flor de sal. \u201cI\u2019d have this as my last meal on Earth,\u201d said Longoria. Here\u2019s the recipe. \u2022 At Uxmal, Mayan archaeologist Don Pepe cooked up smoked pork and bean stew. It cooks underground for 12 hours.  \u2022 Kinich in Izamal is famous for its queso relleno. A key ingredient is, surprisingly, Dutch cheese. See how it\u2019s made:  Mexico City: The city of tacos \u201cIt\u2019s crazy, it\u2019s crowded, it\u2019s noisy \u2013 and I love it!\u201d Longoria said as she walked the streets of Mexico City, where she lives part-time with her family. This region was once the capital of the mighty Aztec empire, known as Tenochtitl\u00e1n until the Spanish invaded about 500 years ago and changed its name to Mexico City. Here are the places Eva Longoria visited in the episode: \u2022 Tomasa is a Mexican bakery known for its conchas, a fluffy sweet bread with a crunchy topping.  \u2022 El Huequito in the Historic Center serves up delicious al pastor tacos, which are a staple in Mexico City. \u2022 Tacos Los Alexis is sizzling hot in the taco world. Owner Alexis Ayala uses his five-star culinary training to transform traditional recipes from his childhood into to-die-for gourmet tacos.  \u2022 Contramar in Roma, the bohemian part of town, is one of Longoria\u2019s favorite restaurants. Owner and chef Gabriela C\u00e1mara made her signature dish: pescado a la talla. \u2022 M\u00e1ximo Bistrot, a gourmet restaurant that marries French and Mexican cuisine, is run by chef Eduardo \u201cLalo\u201d Garc\u00eda. For Longoria, he made a roasted beet salad with rocket and wilted purslane. Best known as a weed, purslane is nonetheless edible and very nutritious. \u2022 Mercado de Jamaica is one of hundreds of markets in the city. At the street food stalls, Longoria tried green chorizo tacos and tlacoyos, thick oval-shaped tortillas typically stuffed with beans or cheese. \u2022 Casa Tochan refugee shelter is the first shelter for immigrants in Mexico City. The residents cook dishes from their homeland to share with their housemates.  \u2022 El Moro is an institution famous for its churros and chocolate. \u2022 Hiyoko restaurant in Little Tokyo cooks up a Mexican-Japanese fusion. Chef and restaurateur Edo L\u00f3pez whipped up tapioca tostadas, chicken skewers with ants and duck donburi.  After each episode, we\u2019ll add to this story with the latest locations where you can sample food featured in \u201cSearching for Mexico.\u201d  Sign up for CNN\u2019s Unlocking Mexico newsletter.

It has all the hallmarks of the classic fine-dining cuisine Bocuse was famed for: quail and foie gras, wrapped in mushroom pat\u00e9 and pastry, and lavished with truffle sauce. But at Krasota, a fine-dining restaurant in Dubai, nothing is what it seems. Bocuse is not physically there; he\u2019s been dead for six years. Instead, it\u2019s his likeness projected onto the room\u2019s curved walls, before dissolving into the dark. This dish, from the recipe to the wall projection to the deep fake video of Bocuse, was designed by artificial intelligence (AI). It\u2019s one of eight courses in \u201cImaginary Futures,\u201d a multisensory dining experience at Krasota. The experience takes diners through different scenarios of what the future could look like, from an underwater city to a space colony to a post-nuclear apocalypse, with each dish themed for its setting. For its AI scenario, Krasota\u2019s co-founders \u2014\u00a0digital artist Anton Nenashev, chef Vladimir Mukhin, and entrepreneur Boris Zarkov \u2014 ceded control to technology. Nenashev, who designs the projections with 3D computer graphics software, let the AI come up with 150 different concepts, before merging together the best; and Mukhin prompted generative platform Midjourney to reimagine Bocuse\u2019s most iconic recipes, including his signature truffle V.G.E soup. \u201cWe drew inspiration from the intriguing prospect of AI (re)creating individuals based on comprehensive data about their lives and experiences,\u201d explains Zarkov. He describes it as a digital-age s\u00e9ance that evokes the memories and style of the late chef through technology \u2014 and it\u2019s just the beginning for the future of dining, he says. \u201cLiving hand-in-hand with artificial intelligence has shifted from fantasy to reality,\u201d Zarkov adds. \u2018First of its kind\u2019 Zarkov, the restauranteur behind the acclaimed White Rabbit in Moscow (where Mukhin is also head chef and co-founder), came up with the idea for Krasota while visiting teamLabs digital art museum in Tokyo in 2017, which featured an interactive \u201ctea house\u201d experience. \u201cThe projection on the table was very simple \u2014 for example, you take the matcha tea and it\u2019s like the tree starts to grow from your cup,\u201d Zarkov explains. \u201cI decided to do something more with the technology: more (food-focused), more complicated.\u201d Assembling an international team of engineers, they began working on multi-surface projections and an AI-enabled interactive tabletop that uses sensors to distinguish between different objects, such as plates and glasses, versus guests\u2019 hands or phones, which allows targeted projection \u2014 for example, fireflies that \u201cgather\u201d on glasses and plates, or an arcade game activated by the diner\u2019s hand. \u201cThis was the most difficult, complicated technology we made,\u201d says Zarkov. He claims the technology was \u201cthe first of its kind\u201d when Krasota initially launched in Moscow in 2021, and recalls staff spending a full month training the AI by repeatedly putting plates down on the table and moving objects to test it. \u201cAt first, it was not very fast \u2014 when you moved your phone, it would take three seconds to react,\u201d says Zarkov. But AI uses machine learning to improve when it receives new information. \u201cNow you can play with any images on the table. It\u2019s like it\u2019s alive,\u201d he adds. Krasota Dubai opened in 2023 with one show, \u201cImaginary Art,\u201d which takes diners through eight courses inspired by famous works by international artists. Six months later, the team launched \u201cImaginary Future,\u201d a speculative voyage through the world in the coming decades. Getting the pacing of the show right was tricky, says Zarkov. \u201cIt\u2019s important to make the focus on the screen, or on the food,\u201d he says, adding, \u201cWhen you have a lot of focus on the screen, your food becomes popcorn.\u201d The experience carefully directs diners\u2019 attention: the most exciting and dynamic visuals are in the breaks between courses, and when food arrives, the graphics become repetitive and passive. The interactive elements only come to the fore when the plates are cleared, and in case there\u2019s any confusion, the human staff (dressed in eccentric thematic costumes) help focus on the correct medium. Whether it\u2019s the food or the screens, Zarkov hopes guests take away that \u201cart is important. We want them to feel it.\u201d \u2018Sonic seasoning\u2019 Technology at the dinner table isn\u2019t an entirely new concept. In 2007, The Fat Duck by Heston Blumenthal in the UK introduced \u201cthe sound of the sea\u201d \u2014 a now-famous dish of shellfish sashimi, plated on an edible sandy shoreline, accompanied by a mini-iPod stuck in a conch shell and earphones playing the sound of waves crashing gently on the beach and the cry of seagulls. It was one of the first technology-enabled multisensory dishes in the world, says Charles Spence, a professor of experimental psychology at the University of Oxford. He\u2019s spent the last two decades exploring how audio-visual stimuli change how food tastes \u2014 or at least, our perception of it. For example, classical melodies will make you think the food is more expensive, and music that matches the cuisine \u2014 for example, Italian songs with a pasta or pizza dish \u2014 will increase the perception of authenticity. In one experiment, Spence found participants rated the same wine \u201cabout 15% sweeter and fruitier with red lighting, compared to when it\u2019s the green light, which brings out the freshness and the acidity instead.\u201d Even the pitch of music can impact the taste, Spence adds: low-pitched sounds will make something taste more bitter, while tinkling, high-pitched notes will bring out the sweetness. \u201cMore and more chefs are deliberately introducing this kind of \u2018sonic seasoning\u2019 to modify the taste of their food,\u201d says Spence, adding that there\u2019s a growing interest from consumers eagers to explore the \u201csurprising connections\u201d between their different senses. Technology is becoming more common in these multisensory experiences. Restaurants like Zenon, also in Dubai, use \u201cAI-generated art installations\u201d to change the mood of the dining room, and private dining room Jing in Hong Kong explores the ancient Song Dynasty through an immersive dinner experience with projections and a lighting scheme. Multisensory goes sci-fi Most multisensory dining experiences, often hosted at high-end venues and conceptualized by world-class chefs, are expensive and inaccessible. (Krasota\u2019s show starts from 1,200 dirhams, around $326.) But Spence likens it to \u201cthe Formula One of food,\u201d where the best dishes and experiences will \u201cpercolate down to the mainstream.\u201d And that\u2019s already happening: Fanta\u2019s \u201cTikTok experience\u201d asked consumers to explore how the flavor of its special edition drink changed with different stimuli, and Spence is working with Italian food manufacturer Barilla on soundscapes for different pasta types. In the future, Spence sees more companies integrating sensory experiences \u2014 perhaps QR codes on products that link to a playlist to enhance the taste. Zarkov\u2019s vision of the future is a little more sci-fi: he speculates that ultimately, brain chips will trick your mind into presenting your senses with whatever your heart desires. \u201cIn your mind, it looks like the best California sushi rolls you\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d says Zarkov. But really, the dish is \u201cbiomass,\u201d with the precise nutrients, vitamins, and minerals your body needs. But if people are plugged into their own hyper-optimized world, if the dishes on the table don\u2019t look the same to your partner as they do to you, if the decor is different, does dining lose its communal and social aspect? \u201cAny technology that interferes with the social aspects of dining will not succeed,\u201d such as headsets or goggles, says Spence. \u201cPeople mostly want to talk with each other; dining is fundamentally a social activity.\u201d Zarkov agrees that the \u201cmain goal is still socializing\u201d and Krasota avoids technology like VR that could be disruptive to the experience. One element the team is currently testing is projecting a \u201clive skin\u201d onto people\u2019s hands, giving them a different aesthetic, like a scaly fish \u2014 but designing it to move with the person is still \u201cvery complicated,\u201d says Zarkov.\u00a0 Krasota is continuing to develop new ideas and experiment with its projection tech. Its next show, expected to launch in early 2025, is inspired by \u201cAlice in Wonderland,\u201d and will \u201cuse a lot of AI in the production, because they made a huge step forward in the technology last year,\u201d says Zarkov, adding: \u201cWe can now \u2018resurrect\u2019 images of people, use AI in creative processes, and either embrace or fear this collaborative dynamic.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/travel/krasota-restaurant-multisensory-artificial-intelligence-hnk-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_fehmarnbelt-tunnel-denmark-germany", "text": "Descending up to 40 meters beneath the Baltic Sea, the world\u2019s longest immersed tunnel will link Denmark and Germany, slashing journey times between the two countries when it opens in 2029. The first tunnel element of the Fehmarnbelt Tunnel was inaugurated June 17 by King Frederik X of Denmark, in what was a milestone moment four years after construction began in 2020, with more than a decade of planning preceding that. On the Danish side, east of R\u00f8dbyhavn, the factory that will build the 89 massive concrete sections that will make up the tunnel was completed last year. Fermern A/S, the state-owned Danish company in charge of the project, says it\u2019s the largest and most advanced production facility of its kind. The tunnel, which will be 18 kilometers (11.1 miles) long, is one of Europe\u2019s largest infrastructure projects, with a construction budget of over 7 billion euros ($7.1 billion). By way of comparison, the 50-kilometer (31-mile) Channel Tunnel linking England and France, completed in 1993, cost the equivalent of \u00a312 billion ($13.6 billion) in today\u2019s money. Although longer than the Fehmarnbelt Tunnel, the Channel Tunnel was made using a boring machine, rather than by immersing pre-built tunnel sections. It will be built across the Fehmarn Belt, a strait between the German island of Fehmarn and the Danish island of Lolland, and is designed as an alternative to the current ferry service from R\u00f8dby and Puttgarden, which carries millions of passengers every year. Where the crossing now takes 45 minutes by ferry, it will take just seven minutes by train and 10 minutes by car. Faster journey The tunnel, whose official name is Fehmarnbelt Fixed Link, will also be the longest combined road and rail tunnel anywhere in the world. It will comprise two double-lane motorways \u2013 separated by a service passageway \u2013 and two electrified rail tracks. \u201cToday, if you were to take a train trip from Copenhagen to Hamburg, it would take you around four and a half hours,\u201d Jens Ole Kaslund, technical director at Femern A/S, said in 2022. \u201cWhen the tunnel will be completed, the same journey will take two and a half hours. \u201cToday a lot of people fly between the two cities, but in the future it will be better to just take the train,\u201d he adds. The same trip by car will be around an hour faster than today, taking into account time saved by not lining up for the ferry. Besides the benefits to passenger trains and cars, the tunnel will have a positive impact on freight trucks and trains, Kaslund said, because it creates a land route between Sweden and Central Europe that will be 160 kilometers shorter than today. At the moment, traffic between the Scandinavian peninsula and Germany via Denmark can either take the ferry across the Fehmarnbelt or a longer route via bridges between the islands of Zealand, Funen and the Jutland peninsula. Work underway The project dates back to 2008, when Germany and Denmark signed a treaty to build the tunnel. It then took over a decade for the necessary legislation to be passed by both countries and for geotechnical and environmental impact studies to be carried out. While the process completed smoothly on the Danish side, in Germany a number of organizations \u2013 including ferry companies, environmental groups and local municipalities \u2013 appealed against the approval of the project over claims of unfair competition or environmental and noise concerns. In November 2020 a federal court in Germany dismissed the complaints. \u201cThe ruling came with a set of conditions, which we kind of expected and we were prepared for, on how we monitor the environment while we are constructing, on things like noise and sediment spill. I believe that we really need to make sure that the impact on the environment is as little as possible,\u201d Henrik Vincentsen, CEO of Femern A/S, said in 2022. Several other phases of the project are underway, including the digging of the actual trench that will host the tunnel. Each section will be 217 meters long (roughly half the length of the world\u2019s largest container ship), 42 meters wide and 9 meters tall. Weighing in at 73,000 metric tons each, they will be as heavy as more than 13,000 elephants. The factory has three halls and six production lines. The sections will be placed just beneath the seabed, about 40 meters below sea level at the deepest point, and moved into place by barges and cranes. Positioning the sections will take roughly three years. A wider impact Up to 2,500 people will work directly on the construction project. Michael Svane of the Confederation of Danish Industry, one of Denmark\u2019s largest business organizations, told CNN in 2022 that he believes the tunnel will be beneficial to businesses beyond Denmark itself. \u201cThe Fehmarnbelt tunnel will create a strategic corridor between Scandinavia and Central Europe. The upgraded railway transfer means more freight moving from road to rail, supporting a climate-friendly means of transport. We consider cross-border connections a tool for creating growth and jobs not only locally, but also nationally,\u201d he said. While some environmental groups have expressed concerns about the impact of the tunnel on porpoises in the Fehmarn Belt, Michael L\u00f8vendal Kruse of the Danish Society for Nature Conservation thinks the project will have environmental benefits. \u201cAs part of the Fehmarnbelt Tunnel, new natural areas and stone reefs on the Danish and German sides will be created. Nature needs space and there will be more space for nature as a result,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the biggest advantage will be the benefit for the climate. Faster passage of the Belt will make trains a strong challenger for air traffic, and cargo on electric trains is by far the best solution for the environment.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/fehmarnbelt-tunnel-denmark-germany/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "travel"}}
