In the Lone Star State, who gets the credit for these morning tortilla sensations can be a matter of haba\u00f1ero-hot debate. A highly contested Eater article in 2016 helped start a full-on Breakfast Taco War between Austin and San Antonio. While that particular battle eventually settled down, flare-ups continue. But to get a true picture of this simple food with a complex history, we must go beyond Texas and first look at another place: Mexico. Mouthwatering tacos in Monterrey The breakfast taco is actually part of a long parade of foods (pizza, for instance) whose fuzzy origins and various claims of authenticity spark ferocious debate. There\u2019s one thing we know for darn sure: Today, breakfast tacos are enjoyed on both sides of the Rio Grande River. In her CNN \u201cSearching for Mexico\u201d series, actor Eva Longoria traveled to Monterrey in the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n.     There, she enjoyed a breakfast taco with Mexican food bloggers Gerardo Alvarado and Ernesto Esquivel at Tacos Do\u00f1a Mary La Gritona, which has been serving central Monterrey for nearly 20 years.  \u201cThe breakfast taco may be the simplest of street food, but it\u2019s been been hitting the spot for the workers of Monterrey for nearly a century,\u201d narrates Longoria. \u2018Not a junkie food\u2019   CNN Travel caught up with Esquivel \u2013 born and raised in the border state of Sonora and resident of Monterrey for more than 10 years \u2013 to find out more. \u201cWhen I arrived in Monterrey, I discovered all the different types of tacos that everyone eats in the morning. You can have a taco of eggs. You can have a taco of meat. You can have a taco of potatoes.\u201d Esquivel describes breakfast tacos as \u201ca really fast food, but not a junkie food.\u201d  Esquivel said you can find breakfast tacos in other states in northern Mexico, but Monterrey and the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n are the culinary epicenter with more places to get them and a larger selection of fillings.  Some of the city\u2019s favorites are the machacado (dried beef) with eggs, the barbacoa (slow-cooked meat, often in a pit) and the deshebrada (shredded beef). In other words, you\u2019re in meat country. Timeline of the breakfast taco Esquivel said the breakfast taco goes back to the early 1900s and perhaps even earlier in Monterrey.  Compa\u00f1ia Fundidora, a former iron and steel foundry that dates to 1900 but is now a recreational and educational park, helped the breakfast taco get its start in Monterrey. Employees came \u201cto work really early, and so they had to have a really fast breakfast in the morning, and one fast breakfast in the morning is a breakfast taco.\u201d  And from there, the tacos spread into southern Texas, Esquivel said, which is reflected in the cuisine of today. \u201cI think the flavors here in Monterrey, mostly in the north, are similar to some flavors in Texas.\u201d Along with Do\u00f1a Mary\u2019s, he suggests these spots for a breakfast taco if you\u2019re in Monterrey: Tacos Rafa Ahogados, Tacos Piedra and Tony\u2019s Tacos. North of the Rio Grande   The river may mark a political line between two nations, but it has been no barrier at all to crossings of cuisine and culture. And Texas also shares a passion for the breakfast taco. You can tell that just from all the kerfuffles about them. \u201cNo Texas city can claim the breakfast taco,\u201d says Jos\u00e9 Ralat, the taco editor of Texas Monthly magazine. He places the ultimate credit south of the Rio Grande. \u201cIt comes from Mexico \u2013 where exactly, it\u2019s not really known. Geographically, the most likely source is northern Mexico. There is no literature that I have seen that can point to any particular city in northern Mexico.\u201d As for today, \u201cthey\u2019re popular in [the Mexican states of] Tamaulipas, Nuevo Le\u00f3n and Coahuila, which all border Texas,\u201d he said. Eddie Vega \u2013 who grew up in McAllen, across from the Mexican city of Reynosa in Tamaulipas state \u2013 is known as \u201cTaco Poet of Texas.\u201d He points out that historically, what\u2019s now south Texas was once part of Mexico.  Before 1836, \u201cthe border was further north. All this region was eating a combination of indigenous and Spanish food together.\u201d Vega said that growing up, breakfast tacos weren\u2019t some trendy food to him attracting attention from the likes of The New York Times and other coastal media. \u201cWhen you get to south Texas, and I\u2019m from the Valley, we had breakfast tacos, but they were in my house. My mom would make them. It\u2019s not something we\u2019d go to a restaurant to get because economically that region is very poor and nobody\u2019s eating out. Or not eating out in the morning especially.\u201d Enter Austin Ralat and Vega both said the breakfast taco was staple deep in south Texas and then San Antonio long before Austin got in on the action. So how did Austin become so synonymous with them? Austin has \u201ca great branding mentality, they have a knack for PR. Every year, Austin is flooded with coastal elites checking out South by Southwest,\u201d Ralat said. \u201cThey try some options, and then in their minds, they think it\u2019s an Austin thing. My job is to question the stuff \u2026 and let history speak for itself.\u201d  Ralat said San Antonio has \u201ca bit of an inferiority complex that they\u2019re often overlooked to the benefit of Austin when San Antonio is older, has more culture, it\u2019s more diverse, and the food is better.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, they\u2019re both Tex Mex towns, and breakfast tacos are Tex Mex. But they\u2019re also border food. When the Eater article came out\u201d \u2013 championing Austin as \u201chome\u201d of the breakfast taco \u2013 \u201cSan Antonians lost their minds.\u201d   Vega said the culinary history is too distant for any one place to stamp itself as originator or king purveyor. \u201cI don\u2019t know that one city \u2013 San Antonio, Corpus Christi, McAllen, Brownsville or Laredo \u2013 can claim it. You have differences with them because of ingredients.\u201d Movin\u2019 on Jessica Elizarraras, a Rio Grande Valley native and the executive producer for MySA.com, said many people have put the origins dispute behind them. \u201cI think at this point we\u2019ve mostly moved on from the great taco war of 2016,\u201d Elizarraras said in an email interview with CNN Travel. \u201cIs there occasional ribbing? Absolutely! Are there great tacos across the state? 1000 percent. The Mexican diaspora is far-reaching and so are their tacos.\u201d She cites a 2016 article by Gustavo Arellano as a detailed settlement of the issue that effectively shows Austin is not the start of the breakfast taco.  She also points out the regional differences within Texas. \u201cA flour tortilla in San Antonio tends to lean a bit puffier than its Rio Grande Valley/Coast counterparts. Con Huevos Tacos in San Antonio is the best of both worlds: a thin but sturdy tortilla, filled with fun, flavorful combinations.\u201d They\u2019ve gone nationwide   Ralat said he\u2019s now seeing breakfast tacos coast to coast. He was also recently in Nashville and saw them offered there.  \u201cI hesitate to eat them at a place that calls them Austin-style. \u2026 I want the food to be high quality. I don\u2019t want it to be spin.\u201d  Elizarraras suggests people just enjoy them \u2013 with or without huevos (eggs).  \u201cBreakfast tacos are ephemeral as they come, which makes them that much more magical,\u201d she said. \u201cBean and cheese is a great example of a breakfast taco that doesn\u2019t have eggs. \u2026 Chicharron en salsa (verde or rojo) is another example of a tasty taco that doesn\u2019t require eggs. Barbacoa \u2013 made using a whole cow-head, and more generally, beef cheeks \u2013 is a classic breakfast taco in San Antonio, often paired with Big Red [soda] for a Sunday morning treat.\u201d  The joy of it all In the end, why does the origin of a type of food even matter? \u201cPart of the issue is erasure. Just like with anything else in our Mexican-American culture, to feel left out of a conversation when you know you\u2019ve part of that conversation for a long time.\u201d Vega said. And back south of the Rio Grande, they are a source of unity, Esquivel said.  \u201cI think the breakfast tacos here in Monterrey \u2026 and the northeast of the country is something that unites everyone.\u201d  They\u2019re popular with the poor, the middle class and the rich, he said. \u201cThe place can be ugly. The place can be like in the streets. But you will see people in suits there eating breakfast tacos.\u201d  For Ralat, breakfast tacos are much more than a great way to start the morning. \u201cI think history, especially food history, is important to know because it provides another mirror for our culture. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to me that tortillas are the foundation of Mexican culture, and to break bread with someone is a sacred act. So let\u2019s take it literally, and say that you share tacos with someone else. That\u2019s so nice. And it\u2019s just so joyful.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/article/breakfast-tacos-origins-mexico-texas/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_worlds-most-spectacular-airport-landings", "text": "There\u2019s a lot to love about travel. Experiencing a new culture. Eating great food. Staying in top notch hotels\u2026 and landing in a new airport. Of course, not all airports are created equal. Some have incredible amenities. Some provide easy access into town. Some make connections a dream. And some have truly dreamy approaches. There are plenty of spectacular landing strips around, but often the best known are located in out-of-the-way destinations. So here we\u2019ve put together some of the most beautiful approaches in major destinations \u2013 along with which side of the aircraft you should sit to best appreciate them. Rio de Janeiro (SDU) Roller coastering over hills, backed by lush mountains, and fringed by slashes of sandy beaches and the Atlantic Ocean beyond, Rio has one of the most naturally beautiful settings in the world. While international flights land at Gale\u00e3o International Airport, outside the city center, Santos Dumont \u2013 the city\u2019s smaller airport \u2013 serves many domestic destinations (including shuttle flights to S\u00e3o Paulo). Not only is it in the city center, but it\u2019s right in Guanabara Bay, on reclaimed land, making for incredible views as you come in or out. Try the right hand side for a glimpse of Rio\u2019s icons, including Sugarloaf Mountain. Sit on the right Mal\u00e9 (VIA) You\u2019d expect a spectacular approach into the Maldives; and that\u2019s what you get here at Velana International Airport, just offshore from Mal\u00e9 on the island of Hulhul\u00e9. When it was first built in the 1960s, it had a runway made of steel slats; these days it\u2019s a standard asphalt surface, though there\u2019s nothing standard about the views of the atoll-sprinkled Indian Ocean as you come in to land. Sit either side Venice (VCE) From the air, Venice looks like a fish, swimming towards the mainland with its tail flapping against the Adriatic Sea. You don\u2019t see that from the ground, but you do as you come in to land at Marco Polo airport, due north of the city center on the mainland. Sit on the right of the plane and you\u2019ll see the city unspool beneath you, from the MOSE flood barriers and Lido island to the terracotta roofs, stocky belltowers and even flashes of the Grand Canal. In the last few seconds of the flight you\u2019ll see Burano and Torcello islands, before landing amid the salt marshes of the north lagoon. Sit on the right Cape Town (CPT) Swaddled by two oceans \u2013 the Indian and Atlantic \u2013 and with Table Mountain looming up behind, Cape Town is up there with Rio de Janeiro for a spectacular natural setting. Sit on the right hand side and, if you\u2019re on a northwestern approach, you should fly past Table Mountain, poking out above the clouds. You might also glimpse Simon\u2019s Town on the Cape peninsula, or fly straight out over the ocean and back at the city \u2013 in which case, you\u2019ll have water views on either side. Sit on the right San Francisco (SFO) With its mixture of coastline and hills, San Francisco is up there with Cape Town and Rio for knockout natural beauty, and you\u2019ll get views aplenty landing at SFO. It\u2019s best at take off, when the left side can often net you views of the city and Golden Gate Bridge before you bank east. On landing, either side should give you water views \u2013 with glimpses of the ocean to the left and the Bay Area to the right. Sit on the left Genoa (GOA) There are few better ways to make an entry onto the Med than with a landing at Genoa\u2019s airport, whose runway is a peninsula of reclaimed land dandling on the Ligurian Sea, just outside the city center. Which side to plump for depends whether you\u2019re a fan of sea or city views: to see the brightly colored houses of Genoa city center spooling down the cliffside, with mountains rearing up behind them, sit on the right; if you prefer the glistening Med, and the feeling of landing on water, pick the left \u2013 you\u2019ll see the tarmac just before you hit it. Sit on the right for the city, the left for water views London Heathrow (LHR) Heathrow airport may be a way outside London\u2019s city center, but if you\u2019re flying in on the often used eastern approach, you\u2019ll get a bird\u2019s eye view of the UK capital on the right hand side as you swoop over its landmarks on final approach. You\u2019ll follow the Thames through central London, past Greenwich and Canary Wharf, over London Bridge and St Paul\u2019s, and finally past Buckingham Palace and the royal parks which surround it. You\u2019ll glimpse Wembley Stadium right before touchdown. Another, less used approach goes over Windsor \u2013 although the best views for that are from the left. Sit on the right Kigali (KGL) Rwanda is beautiful from the air, and the descent into capital Kigali shows off the country at its best. Crossing over from the Democratic Republic of Congo into Rwanda, you\u2019ll descend over lush green hills, speckled with houses and red streaks of the local earth roads \u2013 all backed up by mountains in the distance for added drama. On the right side, you should glimpse Lake Kivu, which acts as the border between Rwanda and the DCR, before descending over the hills. Sit on the right Nice (NCE) Like Genoa along the coast, and Santos Dumont in Rio, Nice\u2019s airport is built on water, with the runway on reclaimed land. From the left hand side, you\u2019ll likely glide past the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur coastline as you come in, while on the right you\u2019ll see the glittering sea. Sitting on the left for take-off should net you views of Monaco, too. Sit on the left S\u00e3o Paulo (GRU) The world\u2019s largest Portuguese-speaking city, with a whopping population of 12.3 million, S\u00e3o Paulo can feel intimidatingly huge on the ground, but flying in is a different thing entirely. Take an evening flight to see the ultimate urban landscape rolling out below you \u2013 a galaxy of lights beaming so strong that even in cloud cover, those same clouds gleam as if they\u2019re alive. Wherever you sit (as long as it\u2019s not over the wing) you\u2019ll have a sparkling view. Sit either side Innsbruck (INN) Nervous fliers might want a drink before they commence their descent into Innsbruck. The main airport in Austria\u2019s Tyrol region, it\u2019s cocooned by mountains on all sides \u2013 mountains the planes must clear on final descent before making it into the valley to land. Having said that, it\u2019s a spectacular entrance \u2013 particularly in winter, when those same mountains are dusted in snow. Either side\u2019s spectacular, though down in the valley, the mountains on the left, dotted with villages,are arguably more interesting to look at. Sit on the left Queenstown (ZQN) The weather is the main issue flying into the main airport on New Zealand\u2019s South Island \u2013 and means you may barely get a view at all. But if the clouds are playing ball, landing here means spectacular views of the Southern Alps. The left side should give you the best views of the mountains and the South Island\u2019s coast unfolding ahead of you. Sit on the left Hong Kong (HKG) Hong Kong International Airport (also known as Chep Lak Kok) is built on reclaimed land in the South China Sea, so you already know it\u2019s going to be another great landing. Visibility tends to be not great, but you\u2019ll still have superb views of the South China Sea and its islands as you get below cloud level. You\u2019ll swoop over container ships, fishing boats and junks, before descending close to Lantau island (usually on the right) and onto the tarmac. Sit on the right Santiago de Chile (SCL) If snowcapped mountains are your thing, this is the destination for you. You\u2019ll have ravishing views of the Andes as you come in towards Santiago, giving way to arid hills and then the plains, those mountains rearing up in the distance, as you come into the basin to land. Stay on the left side to keep the Andes in sight all the way down. Sit on the left Las Vegas (LAS) Sit on the right of the plane and look north as you come into land at Sin City for spectacular views of the famous Strip. Make it an evening flight to see the neon lights at their finest, or fly in during the day for views of the never-ending Mojave desert surrounding it. You\u2019ll usually approach over Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam, while take-offs whisk you over the sandstone \u2018hills\u2019 of Red Rock Canyon.

{"id": "travel_kazakhstan-destination-wedding-romance-chance-encounters", "text": "Ariff Hassan arrived at the wedding under strict instructions: \u201cStay away from the bridesmaid.\u201d It was August 2018. Ariff had traveled from his home in Singapore to Kazakhstan to attend the wedding of an old friend. This friend, like Ariff, had grown up in Malaysia. They\u2019d been close back in the day, but lost touch when Ariff moved to the UK in early adulthood. When Ariff relocated to Singapore, the two friends reconnected, and then the wedding invite followed. Ariff was touched and honored to make the guest list. Plus, his friend\u2019s soon-to-be wife was from Kazakhstan \u2013 the couple had met in Kuala Lumpur \u2013 and the celebrations were set to take place in Kazakhstan\u2019s largest city: Almaty. A keen traveler, Ariff never turned down the opportunity to explore somewhere new. Right away, he RSVPed \u201cyes.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d been to Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan before, and I thought, \u2018I\u2019ve not been to Kazakhstan. When else am I going to go?\u201d Ariff tells CNN Travel today. Ariff\u2019s friend was delighted that Ariff could make his celebrations. But before the big day, the friend took Ariff aside and gave him a firm warning. \u201cThe bridesmaid\u201d was his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s cousin. Ariff\u2019s friend wanted to avoid a potentially messy family situation, especially as he figured Ariff wasn\u2019t after anything serious. \u201cListen,\u201d said Ariff\u2019s friend. \u201cI know you don\u2019t want to get married. And I don\u2019t want to have any problems later, with my extended family. So just give her a wide berth, OK?\u201d Ariff laughed, but he agreed. Anyway, he wasn\u2019t going to the wedding to meet women \u2013 he just wanted to cheer on his friend on his big day, and experience a new country and culture. In the week leading up to the wedding, the bride and groom planned daily activities for their wedding guests \u2013 many of whom, like Ariff, were in Kazakhstan for the first time. Ariff liked Almaty right away. He recalls thinking the city seemed like \u201ca great mix of old Soviet architecture and modern shiny buildings, quiet alleys and parks, and busy bars and restaurants.\u201d \u201cIt is surrounded by beautiful mountains,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe had the chance to stay in a chalet up there for a few days, where the views were absolutely breathtaking.\u201d Then, the night before the wedding, Ariff attended a dinner hosted by the bride\u2019s side of the family. And that\u2019s when he saw Liliya Dauletaliyeva for the first time. \u201cI remember Lili walked in,\u201d says Ariff. She stood out to him right away. \u201cShe was wearing a check shirt. All the other girls were wearing evening dresses.\u201d Over dinner, Liliya was friendly, chatty and at the center of most of the conversations. To Ariff, she projected self-confidence. \u201cShe was doing the translating, between Russian and English, for everybody\u2019s benefit,\u201d Ariff recalls. But when Liliya approached Ariff and tried to make conversation, Ariff made only noncommittal, vague and decidedly awkward responses. He really wanted to talk to Liliya, find out more about her. But Ariff\u2019s friend\u2019s warning was ringing round his head. Because Liliya was \u2013 of course, inevitably \u2013 the bridesmaid Ariff had been warned to stay away from. First impressions Back in 2018, Liliya Dauletaliyeva, born and raised in Almaty, was in her early 20s and living in the Kazakh capital of Astana. She\u2019d recently finished up her bachelor\u2019s degree and enrolled in a master\u2019s program. Liliya was firmly focused on her studies and \u201cnot planning to get married\u201d any time soon. When she wasn\u2019t working late in the library, Liliya was planning future travels. She loved exploring the world, and prioritized adventures whenever she could. She\u2019d just got back from a trip to Iceland, and was looking forward to her cousin\u2019s wedding partly because she\u2019d get to meet a bunch of people from across the world. At the pre-wedding dinner, Liliya noticed her cousin\u2019s fianc\u00e9 only had a couple of friends who\u2019d flown in for the celebrations. One of the guys seemed outgoing and talkative. The other \u2013 Ariff \u2013 seemed more reserved. Liliya wondered if he was shy, or perhaps nervous. \u201cI know a lot of people, their first impression of Kazakhstan, it might be a bit of a cultural shock,\u201d Liliya tells CNN Travel. \u201cSo I thought that he must be feeling a bit weird \u2013 or maybe even awkward because he just reconnected with his friend that he hadn\u2019t seen for ages.\u201d Liliya tried to talk to Ariff to make him feel \u201cmore comfortable.\u201d But she approached him, his eyes widened and he seemed even more awkward than before. \u201cI didn\u2019t talk back,\u201d says Ariff. \u201cI had instructions to follow.\u201d The wedding the next day was \u201can almost 12-hour affair,\u201d as Ariff recalls. \u201cA Kazah wedding is very different from a Southeast Asian wedding,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of drinks and a lot of dancing.\u201d It was a great day, and when the celebrations wrapped up at around 1 a.m., the party continued at a nearby hotel. \u201cThere was a huge karaoke venue at that hotel,\u201d says Liliya. \u201cAnd so all the young people \u2013 the bridesmaids and the friends and family, we all went there.\u201d That\u2019s how, in the early hours of the morning, Ariff and Liliya found themselves sitting side by side in the karaoke bar. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when we started talking, \u201c says Liliya. \u201cAfter all this singing and drinking and dancing. We just sat down and talked.\u201d After \u201ceight or nine hours of drinking\u201d Ariff was no longer preoccupied about his friend\u2019s warning. \u201cThe instructions went out the window,\u201d he says. Connecting at 1 a.m. At first, Liliya and Ariff talked about Kazakhstan. Liliya asked Ariff what he thought of her home country, commenting that Ariff seemed to be one of very few friends of the groom who\u2019d traveled for the wedding. \u201cWhy did you decide to come?\u201d she asked him. \u201cI know many people are like, \u2018Oh Kazakhstan, what is this place? Why would we go there?\u2019\u201d \u201cI like adventures,\u201d said Ariff. \u201cI love traveling and exploring new countries.\u201d Ariff mentioned the wedding invite had come through when he was planning a trip to Iceland. He\u2019d abandoned those plans, and prioritized Kazakhstan instead. \u201cI told him that I just came back from Iceland a couple of months before,\u201d recalls Liliya. \u201cWe realized that we both love traveling. And then just started talking about all these adventures and travel plans, where we want to go\u2026\u201d Liliya and Ariff spent the rest of the evening deep in conversation, but parted ways without exchanging contact details. Still, Ariff was hopeful they might see each other again \u2013 following the Kazak wedding, Ariff\u2019s friend and Liliya\u2019s cousin had a second wedding celebration planned in Malaysia in a few weeks time. Ariff figured Liliya, as a bridesmaid, would likely be there, although he didn\u2019t know for sure. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her,\u201d he said. \u201cI tried to figure out how to contact her without obviously asking my friend or his wife for help \u2013 because, you know, the instructions were to stay away from the cousin.\u201d In the end, Ariff tracked Liliya down on Facebook and dropped her a friend request and a message: \u201cHey, I hear you\u2019re coming to Malaysia this weekend for the second leg of the wedding,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf you\u2019d like to hang out or something, here\u2019s my number.\u201d \u201cAnd then we did hang out,\u201d says Ariff. It was a fun few days \u2013 Ariff showed Liliya his favorite places in Kuala Lumpur and recalls that they \u201cwere quite excited to see each other.\u201d Still, it wasn\u2019t obvious where their connection would go from there. \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of long distance,\u201d says Liliya. \u201cI kept thinking, \u2018Maybe we can be friends.\u2019\u201d Taking a risk Before she left Malaysia, Liliya \u2013 on a whim \u2013 invited Ariff to come and visit Kazakhstan again, in a month\u2019s time, for her 24th birthday party. \u201cI obviously sat on the decision for about a week and a half, because I thought, \u2018I\u2019ve just been there,\u2019\u201d recalls Ariff. He remembers turning the idea over in his mind. Ariff really liked Liliya and wanted to see her again. But traveling across the world on a bit of a whim seemed \u201ccrazy.\u201d \u201cI was kind of hesitating to go, because I thought, \u2018This is insanity,\u2019\u201d says Ariff. Ariff mentioned the dilemma to an older family friend whose opinion he trusted. Ariff\u2019s confidant told him that, some 40 years ago he\u2019d \u201cmissed an opportunity with a girl\u201d and still regretted it to that day. \u201cHe was like, \u2018Don\u2019t be me. Go and live your life,\u2019\u201d Ariff recalls. So Ariff put aside his hesitations and embarked on the 19-hour journey to visit Liliya. \u201cI took three planes,\u201d he recalls. \u201cSingapore to Bangkok, Bangkok to Almaty, Almaty to Astana.\u201d \u201cI remember I went to pick him up from the airport,\u201d Liliya says. \u201cI was so nervous. I called my friends and I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. Why did I even agree to that? What did I sign up for? This guy, I only saw him for like, four or five days.\u2019\u201d Liliya wondered what she and Ariff were going to talk about, what were they going to do together, would it be awkward? But as soon as they were together again, Liliya and Ariff\u2019s respective worries melted away. \u201cWe literally spent every single day together. He stayed for 10 days. And every minute that I was not in school, we tried to spend together,\u201d says Liliya. \u201cIt was so much fun.\u201d Liliya also felt heartened that Ariff had followed through \u2013 she\u2019d invited him, he\u2019d said he\u2019d come, and then he did. \u201cI was pleasantly surprised,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI was like, \u2018That\u2019s the person that keeps his word, that you can rely on.\u2019 I started thinking, \u2018I wouldn\u2019t mind starting a relationship with a person like this.\u2019\u201d Deciding on the future By the end of the 10 days, both Liliya and Ariff were certain about their future. \u201cThat first trip, we decided we were going to get married,\u201d says Ariff. It wasn\u2019t really a formal conversation, says Liliya: \u201cWe were just having dinner and talking.\u201d Neither of them had been looking for love, let alone marriage. But after meeting each other, Ariff and Liliya were sure they wanted to be together, and to commit to a life side by side. They knew the whole thing was \u201cpretty nuts,\u201d as Ariff puts it today. But they were confident in their feelings and in each other. A month later, in October, Liliya went with Ariff to visit his parents in Malaysia. That Christmas, Ariff\u2019s mother invited Liliya on a family trip to the UK. Ariff\u2019s parents liked Liliya right away \u2013 and, certain marriage was on the cards, Ariff\u2019s mother suggested she and Liliya go shopping for wedding dresses while they were in London. Lilya and Ariff wanted to avoid extended periods of long distance, so around this time Liliya decided to quit her master\u2019s degree and move to Singapore to be with Ariff. \u201cObviously my family didn\u2019t approve,\u201d says Liliya. \u201cBut I thought, \u2018You know what, I can get my master\u2019s in Malaysia or Singapore, and that\u2019s probably an even better option. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u2019\u201d In general Liliya and Ariff\u2019s friends and loved ones were supportive, but a little concerned about the speed at which the romance was moving. \u201cIt was really fast,\u201d admits Liliya. \u201cSome of my friends, they\u2019re still shocked. They\u2019re like, \u2018He hadn\u2019t even proposed and his mom took you to pick a wedding dress.\u2019\u201d Liliya and Ariff shrugged off the concerns, and in December 2018, Liliya moved to Singapore. A couple of months later, Ariff formally proposed, on Valentine\u2019s Day 2019. The couple liked the idea of a \u201ca very small, intimate wedding,\u201d says Liliya. \u201cJust friends and family members, somewhere fun.\u201d \u201cMaybe somewhere in the Mediterranean, a bit of a party with friends,\u201d says Ariff. This dream wasn\u2019t to be. \u201cParents had different ideas,\u201d says Ariff, laughing. Ariff and Liliya ended up with several wedding celebrations \u2013 a small ceremony to sign the legal papers in April 2019, followed by a 300-person wedding in Malaysia in the summer \u201cwith a lot of food and alcohol\u201d and another big party in Kazakhstan. Amid all the planning \u2013 and parental negotiations \u2013 Ariff and Liliya took a break and went on a pre-wedding honeymoon. \u201cIt was great to go on a honeymoon before. We picked places where it was very hard to reach us,\u201d says Ariff. The couple returned from their vacation refreshed and ready to enjoy the August 2019 celebrations. Liliya and Ariff Kazakhstan wedding celebration incorporated a number of Kazakh traditions. \u201cWe had \u2018qyz uzatu,\u2019 a Kazakh traditional ceremony where the bride is sent off from her parental home to the groom\u2019s family, marked by a farewell party attended by close relatives and friends,\u201d says Liliya. \u201cThe event includes ceremonial rites, blessings from elders, presenting gifts to the groom\u2019s family, and the singing of traditional Kazakh songs. Parents give their blessings and advice to the bride.\u201d The Malaysian celebration also included \u201crecitations of prayers and blessings, a traditional meal, and an exchange of gifts,\u201d says Liliya. All of the celebrations were \u201ca blast,\u201d says Ariff. There was lots of laughter, and moving moments too. The family friend who encouraged Ariff to take a risk and visit Liliya was one of the witnesses when the couple signed the papers. Meanwhile, friends from across the world came to celebrate with the couple \u2013 including, of course, Ariff\u2019s childhood friend and Liliya\u2019s cousin, who\u2019d unwittingly kicked off Ariff and Liliya\u2019s love story the year before. \u201cI don\u2019t have any siblings, but I grew up with my cousin,\u201d says Liliya. \u201cWe are very close. So obviously she came to both our weddings, and we\u2019re still super close.\u201d Ariff\u2019s friend had forgiven him for breaking his promise to \u201cstay away from the bridesmaid.\u201d But he still worried, right up until the wedding, that it wouldn\u2019t work out. \u201cI think my friend was very stressed until we got married, until we legally signed the papers because he was like, \u2018Please don\u2019t mess it up,\u2019\u201d says Ariff. \u201cNow we\u2019re all part of one big family,\u201d says Liliya. Taking risks together Post-wedding, Liliya and Ariff settled into an easy rhythm in their relationship. The couple \u201cdon\u2019t have many cultural differences,\u201d says Liliya, even though they grew up in different countries. \u201cWe quickly learned that Kazakh and Malay cultures are very similar, both emphasizing the importance of family, traditions, and community,\u201d she says. Still, they like learning new things about each other\u2019s \u201chistory, people, food\u2026\u201d says Liliya. They enjoy sharing these learning moments with one another. After a few years in Singapore, in 2021 Liliya and Ariff moved to Malaysia. And another big shift occurred last year, when Liliya decided to recommence the master\u2019s course she quit back in 2018. \u201cEven after years of working, this idea of me leaving something incomplete kept bothering me, so I decided to apply again,\u201d she says. Liliya was excited to return to academia, but felt the associated upheaval would only be \u201cworth it\u201d if she was attending one of the best universities in the world. That\u2019s how she ended up accepting a place at the University of Oxford, in the UK. Liliya is loving the experience studying there. The only downside is she and Ariff are now contending with the long distance they actively avoided at the start of their relationship. That is slightly \u201cironic,\u201d admits Ariff. But he\u2019s really proud of Liliya and excited for her next career steps. He visits Oxford every month, and is able to work remotely from the UK for significant chunks of time. In between, the couple video chat regularly. \u201cI think it\u2019s actually much easier to have a long distance relationship when you\u2019ve already been in this relationship for quite some time,\u201d says Liliya. The fact Liliya and Ariff both love traveling also makes journeying back and forth a little easier. \u201cWe want to keep exploring the world and experience living in as many countries as possible,\u201d says Liliya, adding they \u201ccan\u2019t imagine their lives without the thrill of new adventures.\u201d \u201cWe like to take risks, both of us, daily,\u201d says Ariff, pointing out that mindset\u2019s woven into their love story. When they first met, they both jumped into the unknown, flying across the world to visit one another, and then deciding to be together, despite the obstacles. Today, Liliya and Ariff find it surreal to think Liliya barely knew Ariff when she moved across the world to be with him. After five years together, they\u2019re just as certain that they made the right choice. And while they know each other much better, they\u2019re still learning new things about each other. Liliya thinks that\u2019s a big part of what it means to be in love with someone. \u201cIt\u2019s just a great feeling when you feel like you just met this person, because you feel like you keep rediscovering, keep learning something new every day,\u201d she says. \u201cIt never gets boring.\u201d \u201cThinking about how all these puzzle pieces, how they all came together \u2013 I just started believing in destiny. What else can it be?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/kazakhstan-destination-wedding-romance-chance-encounters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}

In a statement to CNN, the airline said the scuffle began when a passenger was reportedly coughing and the man next to him tried to move into another seat to get away. However, the man\u2019s attempt to swap seats didn\u2019t work, as the seat he chose already belonged to another male passenger. Those two men then got into an argument over the seat, which the airline said turned physical. That\u2019s when three female flight attendants stepped in to handle the situation, says EVA. Flight BR08 was about three hours into its 12-hour journey from Taipei to San Francisco on Wednesday, May 8 when the incident took place. EVA, which is based in Taiwan, told CNN that the two brawling passengers were both foreigners but did not specify their countries of origin. Thanks to the quick actions of these flight attendants, with assistance from some concerned passengers, the airline said the two men were separated from each other and the rest of the flight continued as scheduled, successfully landing in San Francisco on time. \u201cThe company has always adopted a zero-tolerance policy towards incidents of passenger nuisance,\u201d EVA told CNN in the statement. \u201cThe company will provide appropriate rewards to [the three cabin crew members] later on.\u201d The plane\u2019s captain contacted San Francisco police mid-flight, and the two combative passengers were taken in for questioning on arrival, according to EVA. This isn\u2019t the first time that an in-air incident on EVA made headlines. In 2019, an obese male passenger reportedly forced female flight attendants to help him undress, use the bathroom and clean him afterward, saying he was physically unable to do so himself. Following the incident, EVA publicly expressed its \u201csincere gratitude\u201d to its employees and vowed to look into the incident further. That same year, EVA reversed its policy of only hiring women as flight attendants and said it would hire men as cabin crew members too.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/eva-air-flight-attendants-break-up-fight-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_india-half-hour-time-zone-explainer-intl-hnk", "text": "Nine hours and 30 minutes ahead of New York. Five hours and 30 minutes ahead of London. Three hours and 30 minutes behind Tokyo. For more than a century, India\u2019s clocks have officially fallen short of the full hour in calculating any time difference it has with most countries. And while it is part of a small group of nations and territories that shares that 30-minute gap - including Iran, Myanmar and parts of Australia - India is perhaps the most unlikely outlier. The huge South Asian nation geographically spans what would normally be two time zones, but much to the frustration of some groups, it clings to its unusual clock settings, refusing to part ways with a system that has a very complicated past. India\u2019s half-hour zone dates back to colonial rule of India and the era when ever-faster steamships and trains were shrinking the world. Until the 19th century, India - like most places around the world - operated on very localized times, which were often different not just from city to city, but from village to village. But playing a key role in the background was East India Company,\u00a0a ruthless and powerful British-owned trading organization that gradually seized control of large parts of the subcontinent. The East India Company was managing the one of Asia\u2019s first observatories, in Madras (now known as Chennai) by 1792. A decade later, the first official astronomer at this observatory declared Madras time to be \u201cthe basis of Indian Standard Time.\u201d It took a few decades, the advent of steam-powered locomotives and the commercial interests of the East India Company to make that stick, though. \u201cThe railroads had immense sway over the colonial powers,\u201d says Geoff Gordon, a senior researcher in public international law at the University of Amsterdam. \u201cBefore the railroads won the contest for Madras time, there was a contest among the powerful cities \u2013 Bombay, Kolkata,\u201d adds Gordon. \u201cThat fight didn\u2019t last long.\u201d Meanwhile, similar debates around the world, driven by the need to better coordinate transcontinental rail travel and improve maritime navigation, led to the establishment of the first international time zones at a conference in Washington D.C. in 1884. The zones were based around the Greenwich Meridian, a line of longitude that runs north-south through the Greenwich Observatory in London. Time zones to the east of the Meridian are typically later than Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) in hourly increments. It took a while for the system to be adopted globally. In India, people were still arguing over Madras Time. Despite the time\u2019s adoption by the country\u2019s railways, it faced considerable opposition from workers and local communities unwilling to have rigid new timings imposed on them. \u201cThere\u2019s less room to maneuver as your working rhythms are linked up no longer with your boss down the street, the church bell, and the 20 other people that you go to work with,\u201d says Gordon. \u201cBut it\u2019s now determined by the railroad that arrives once a day.\u201d Eventually, Madras Time was established nationwide by 1905, with only a few remaining holdouts. The start of the 20th century saw some push from scientific associations to calibrate India\u2019s time to GMT. The Royal Society in London proposed two time zones for India, both in full-hour increments from GMT and one another: Six hours ahead of GMT for the east and five hours for the west of the country. That recommendation was rejected by the colonial government, which opted for a unified time that sat squarely in the middle: five and a half hours ahead of GMT. \u201cIt strikes me as sort of typical of the colonial mindset,\u201d says Gordon. And so, in 1906, India\u2019s British rulers introduced what is now known as Indian Standard Time. The politics of time While the 30-minute difference is a lingering remnant of India\u2019s colonial past, some countries have changed their own time zones more recently. Venezuela\u2019s former president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez set clocks back by half an hour in 2007 to give schoolchildren more daylight time, a move that was later reversed by current leader Nicolas Maduro. In 2015, North Korea moved out of sync with South Korea by creating \u201cPyongyang Time,\u201d putting the country eight and a half hours ahead of GMT instead of nine. India\u2019s colonial-era time zone decision making, however, reflected a chorus of political, scientific and commercial voices both from within the government and outside of it, Gordon says. He compares India during this period to \u201cBrazil,\u201d the 1985 dark dystopian sci-fi fantasy film directed by Terry Gilliam, or the comically complicated contraptions drawn by US cartoonist Rube Goldberg. \u201cIt\u2019s just this unbelievably haphazard Rube Goldberg-esque construction, that is built up through lots of different inputs, lots of people acting opportunistically, lots of people acting naively,\u201d he adds. \u201cThere was a lot of weirdness and wildness.\u201d The consequences of a single time zone India\u2019s single time-zone has been the subject of much debate over the years, with populations in the northeast demanding a separate time zone given how wide the country is. Though this problem isn\u2019t unique to India: geographically, China is the third largest in the world and still only has one time zone, which a 2014 study argues is symbolic of the state\u2019s centralized control over people\u2019s everyday lives. India\u2019s official timekeepers, the National Physical Laboratory, even called for two separate time zones on account of this issue, citing reports of India\u2019s time \u201cbadly affecting\u201d the lives of people in the northeast. It proposed two time zones instead: five and a half hours ahead of GMT for one side of India, and six and a half hours for another, specifically what they\u2019ve described as \u201cextreme northeast regions,\u201d including areas like Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. \u201cDespite geographical differences\u2014such as the sun rising and setting nearly two hours earlier in the northeast compared to Gujarat\u2014both regions adhere to the same time-zone,\u201d says Maulik Jagnani, an assistant professor of economics at Tufts University. Jagnani published a widely cited paper in 2019 highlighting the impact of sunlight on natural circadian rhythms in India, with a focus on children. \u201cThis setup affects children\u2019s sleep patterns [\u2026] children exposed to later sunsets go to bed later,\u201d adds Jagnani. \u201cFixed school and work start times do not allow for corresponding adjustments in wake-up times, leading to reduced sleep and poorer educational outcomes.\u201d The NPL also recognized this issue, adding that the circadian rhythm\u2019s impact on health and work efficiency, is tied to the \u201coverall socio-economic development of the region.\u201d However, it looks like India\u2019s unusual time zone is here to stay. When the question of introducing two time zones was put to India\u2019s parliament in 2019, a government committee rejected the concept over unspecified \u201cstrategic reasons.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/india-half-hour-time-zone-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}

Taquer\u00eda El Califa de Le\u00f3n, located in the San Rafael neighborhood of Mexico City, was among the establishments to garner either one or two stars in the first ever Michelin Guide Mexico, published earlier this week, making it the first Mexican taco stand to receive the honor. Chef Arturo Rivera Mart\u00ednez, who has been serving customers at Taquer\u00eda El Califa de Le\u00f3n for at least two decades, was presented with the famous white chef\u2019s jacket while dishing out his popular tacos on Wednesday. \u201cThe secret is the simplicity of our taco,\u201d Rivera Mart\u00ednez told the Associated Press. \u201cIt has only a tortilla, red or green sauce, and that\u2019s it. That, and the quality of the meat.\u201d Taquer\u00eda El Califa de Le\u00f3n, which is only about 10 feet wide, has been around for more than 50 years and is known for its Gaonera taco, apparently named in honor of Mexican bullfighter Rodolfo Gaona. \u201cThis taqueria may be bare bones with just enough room for a handful of diners to stand at the counter but its creation, the Gaonera taco, is exceptional,\u201d reads a statement on the Michelin Guide website. \u201cThinly sliced beef filet is expertly cooked to order, seasoned with only salt and a squeeze of lime. \u201cAt the same time, a second cook prepares the excellent corn tortillas alongside. The resulting combination is elemental and pure.\u201d When asked which drink he\u2019d recommend that diners match with the \u201cexceptional\u201d tacos, Rivera Mart\u00ednez told reporters, \u201cI like a Coke.\u201d Aside from the aforementioned Gaonera taco, customers can opt for three other meat-filled variations, including a bistec (beef steak) filling, served up on a plastic plate for around $5. \u201cWith meat and tortillas of this caliber, the duo of house-made salsas is hardly even necessary,\u201d says the Michelin Guide. Fine dining restaurant Quintonil, run by chef Jorge Vallejo and Alejandra Flores, awarded two stars, and chef Elena Reygadas\u2019s Rosetta, awarded one star, were among the other establishments included on Michelin\u2019s first-ever rankings for Mexico. Focusing on Mexico City, Oaxaca, Baja California, Los Cabos and Nuevo Le\u00f3n, the Michelin Guide inspectors traveled up and down the country to seek out the best culinary experiences on offer. \u201cWhat a joy it is to honor the uniqueness of the Mexican gastronomic landscape in Mexico City,\u201d Gwendal Poullennec, International Director of the Michelin Guides, said in a statement. \u201cThe first and very promising selection is an an illustration of how the country is showcasing its regions, with their cultures and traditions that are as distinctive as they are distinguishable.\u201d Back in 2016, chef Chan Hon Meng\u2019s Singapore stall became the first street-food establishment to be recognized by the distinguished guide.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/taqueria-el-califa-de-leon-mexico-city/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "embraer-airplanes-boeing-history", "text": "One man\u2019s loss is another man\u2019s gain, goes the saying \u2013 and as Boeing seems caught in a spiral of bad news, one aircraft manufacturer is quietly powering ahead. Brazilian manufacturer Embraer, which specializes in smaller narrow-body passenger jets, has been clocking up major announcements, and will soon comprise the entire regional fleet of American Airlines. And now, rumor has it that the company might be setting its sights even higher. A Wall Street Journal report last week suggested that Embraer \u2013 currently the world\u2019s third largest aircraft manufacturer \u2013 was planning a new narrow-body jet that could \u201ccompete head-on\u201d with the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 Max, which have cornered the global market. Embraer has denied the reports. Yet the company\u2019s star is certainly on the rise. On May 2, Embraer delivered its 1,800th E-Jet aircraft: an E190-E2, to Royal Jordanian Airlines. Five days later, Singapore-based Scoot Airlines took delivery of its first Embraer: another E190-E2, the quietest and most fuel-efficient single-aisle jet on the market. Even in the US, where Boeing has traditionally ruled the roost, Embraer has been making waves. On March 26, United announced a refurb of its Embraer E175 fleet to add larger overhead bins on its Skywest-operated planes. The move will increase storage space by 80%. Skywest is the world\u2019s largest operator of Embraer\u2019s E175 aircraft. Then there\u2019s American Airlines, which announced the purchase of 90 E175 aircraft in March, making AA\u2019s entire regional fleet Embraer by the end of the decade.  The love-in continued in April, when CEO Robert Isom praised the Brazilian company during a quarterly call. \u201cThe rest of the industry\u2026 can learn a lot from them,\u201d he said, while also delivering a public rebuke to Boeing to, \u201cGet your act together.\u201d It\u2019s almost as if as Boeing\u2019s star continues to fall, Embraer\u2019s continues to rise. But can it go even bigger \u2013 and turn the \u201cBig Two\u201d of the skies into a \u201cBig Three?\u201d To do so would require coming up with a new, larger aircraft to rival the 737MAX and the A320. At the moment, Embraer aircraft carry a maximum of 146 passengers, compared to the MAX\u2019s minimum 172. It\u2019d also mean scaling up \u2013 Embraer delivered 181 jets in 2023, of which 64 were commercial aircraft. Before the pandemic, it was delivering around 90 commercial aircraft per year. Yet as Boeing struggles to regain public trust, experts say there\u2019s room for someone else to grab a place in the market. \u201cThe door is open a little for a [Boeing] 737 replacement,\u201d says Robert van der Linden, curator of air transportation at the National Air and Space Museum. Although he notes that it could close again \u201cquickly,\u201d and that debuting a new aircraft is a colossal task for manufacturers, he believes that Embraer might uniquely be capable of making headway in the aviation market \u2013 it already has the contacts and reputation. Rodrigo Silva e Souza, Embraer\u2019s VP of marketing who\u2019s responsible for strategic planning, doesn\u2019t deny that he\u2019s looking at potential options, but says, \u201cThat\u2019s my job.\u201d \u201cDesigning, producing and delivering high-quality, highly reliable products is in our DNA, and I think that\u2019s bringing some contrasts with what we\u2019re seeing with other players,\u201d he says, carefully. But he tells CNN that aircraft take at least a decade to design and build, so while the current gap looks promising, they won\u2019t be jumping in feet-first. \u201cDesigning an aircraft takes 10 years, and in 10 years from now the situation is completely different. \u201cIf someone had designed this before, they could be jumping in now, but you don\u2019t decide to make a new aircraft and have it ready next year,\u201d he says. So could Embraer muscle its way to the top? It\u2019s made it against the odds so far. A storied background For an aircraft manufacturer with such a toehold in the US market, Embraer\u2019s origins might come as a surprise. Based in S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos, in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, the company was founded in 1969 by the Brazilian government \u2013 its name is a portmanteau of Empresa Brasileira de Aeron\u00e1utica (Aeronautics Corporation of Brazil) \u2013 on the back of the development of the Bandeirante, a twin-turboprop aircraft. Initially used for the Brazilian military, the Bandeirante entered commercial service in 1972. With 15-21 seats, it was aimed at \u201ccommuter companies,\u201d says Alvaro Romero, a Chilean aviation historian. The company was privatized in 1994, and went public on the stock market in 2000. By that time, says van der Linden, it had already cracked the US. \u201cThey found a very comfortable niche market for regional jets,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was very wise not to compete directly with Boeing and Airbus. Try and break into an oligopoly and chances are you\u2019re going to get squashed. \u201cRegional jets carry anything from 35 to almost 150 passengers and Embraer grabbed hold of that market.\u201d In the regional market, Embraer\u2019s primary competitor was Canada\u2019s Bombardier, which sold its commercial manufacturing arm to Airbus in 2020. In fact, Embraer nearly made a similar deal with Boeing in 2019, when the US giant signed up to take an 80% stake in the Brazilian company\u2019s commercial division \u2013 before reneging on the deal in 2020. You could call it Embraer\u2019s lucky escape. Now, says Silva e Souza, Embraer\u2019s main rival is Airbus itself. Ahead of the competition So how has Embraer succeeded where others have failed? For van der Linden, Brazil was far-sighted. \u201cAs early as the 1940s, the Brazilian government was interested in establishing aviation and aerospace manufacturing,\u201d he says. Government backing meant that Embraer had money to produce quality planes from the outset. \u201cIt developed a very well-deserved reputation,\u201d he says. For aero historian Mario Overall, a member of the Latin American Aviation Historical Society, Embraer is an \u201cexceptional\u201d company. He puts that global success down to several factors, from its diverse portfolio (Embraer still makes military airplanes and private jets) to its designs, export strategy and outsourcing supply, keeping costs down. \u201cIts versatility has enabled Embraer to cater to a wide range of customers,\u201d he says. Yet he calls taking on Boeing a \u201cdaunting\u201d process and doesn\u2019t believe it\u2019ll develop a larger narrowbody. Legions of fans With major US carriers operating small planes on regional routes, Embraer\u2019s focus on sub-200 passenger planes \u2013 its largest, the E195, has a maximum capacity of 146 seats \u2013 is a perfect fit for the US market. They\u2019re also used on less-trafficked routes in Latin America and Europe, as well as at difficult airports. At London City, which requires a steep 5.5 degree approach for the short runway, 85% of the aircraft are Embraers. And while, by the numbers, AA and United are its top clients, Embraer\u2019s biggest airline fan is perhaps LOT Polish Airlines, where 43 of its 75-strong fleet are Embraers (this week, it announced another three). \u201cThese aircraft have been instrumental in our strategy to expand our network, allowing us to confidently launch new routes, even to destinations with initially lower demand. The Embraer fleet\u2019s reliability, efficiency, and passenger appeal make them indispensable,\u201d says LOT spokesperson Krzysztof Moczulski. It\u2019s not just airlines; plenty of frequent flyers have a crush, too. \u201cIn Europe, it\u2019s the best way to fly economy,\u201d says Koen Berghuis of the 82-seater ERJ-175, which he flies on regularly with LOT. \u201cYou have so much legroom, shoulder room, and some airlines have really comfortable seating. You don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re in a sardine can, which I feel on the Boeing 737 MAX. But the 2-2 configuration is the main benefit,\u201d says Berghuis, editor-in-chief of travel blog Paliparan. That\u2019s right \u2013 the dreaded middle seat simply doesn\u2019t exist. In first class on American and United, Embraer goes one better \u2013 it\u2019s a 1-2 configuration. The smaller jets even have 1-2 in economy, too. Travel vlogger Paul Lucas actively seeks to fly Embraer. \u201cIt\u2019s really pleasant to fly on \u2013 it has really big windows that mean loads of cabin light,\u201d he says (van der Linden compares the windows of a bijou Embraer to those on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner). \u201cThey feel like mainline jets inside, but have the operational benefits of a regional jet,\u201d Lucas says of Embraer\u2019s E-jet range. \u201cThey probably should get more of a profile.\u201d For him, a key reason why Embraer doesn\u2019t get the same hype as the Big Two is that it\u2019s Brazilian. \u201cIn the US, Boeing is a flagship company \u2013 Americans were proud of it until recently. And Airbus is pan-European,\u201d he says. \u201cThen there\u2019s Embraer.\u201d Harvesting while Boeing spirals? As Boeing spirals, is there a chance for Embraer to break through? Silva e Souza says that the company\u2019s current focus is the Energia project, which aims to develop 30-seater hybrid-electric aircraft by 2030, slashing the aircraft carbon emissions by 30% (90% if using SAF). A hydrogen-fuel-cell version is planned for 2035, with a 50-seater scheduled for 2040. He also predicts an untapped market for small, sustainable planes to replace long drives. And while he insists that the company is concentrating on \u201charvesting\u201d following \u201c10-15 years of very strong development\u201d \u2013 he\u2019s not denying that they\u2019re eyeing all options. At the Dubai Airshow in November, he hinted that the company was scanning markets such as the Middle East, where it says that only 16% of flights are full \u2013 meaning smaller aircraft could make certain routes more profitable. Meanwhile the company\u2019s 2023 Market Outlook report suggests that \u201cthe future lies in the middle\u201d \u2013 which Silva e Souza defines as 100-150 seats. Space in the middle? Could that \u201cmiddle\u201d get a little bigger, though? The troubled Boeing MAX starts at 172 seats \u2013 not far off Embraer\u2019s E2-195, which seats 146. The only other potential competitor is Comac\u2019s C919, currently only certified to operate in China. Silva e Souza believes that Chinese-made aircraft will make it into the global market, but \u201cit\u2019ll take a long time.\u201d He doesn\u2019t deny that Embraer is monitoring the market, however. \u201cWe speak to investors. We keep looking: smaller, bigger, commercial, defense \u2013 for each we talk to partners who will help build the business case. But we\u2019ve done nothing specifically on the [MAX rival]. \u201cWe\u2019re confident in our capabilities. But it\u2019s very different taking decisions on the current situation for a product that will come 10 years from now.\u201d If they did take the plunge, they have an army of fans waiting to take flight.", "source": "http://cnn.com/embraer-airplanes-boeing-history/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_portugal-american-woman-never-coming-back", "text": "They\u2019d always planned to retire somewhere outside the US, but when the Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020, Cynthia Wilson and her husband Craig Bjork felt compelled to bring their plans forward. The couple, who married in 2009, had already chosen Portugal as their intended destination after Googling \u201cbest places for Americans to retire to\u201d and finding that the European country \u2013 a place Wilson had never visited \u2013 was high on the list. \u201cIt\u2019s funny because I\u2019ve been to like 33 countries, and almost all of northwest Europe,\u201d Wilson, originally from Seattle, tells CNN Travel. \u201cI\u2019ve been to countries like Estonia, but I almost knew nothing about Portugal. \u2018Aha\u2019 moment Thankfully, her husband, a former US marine, \u201cknew everything about it.\u201d \u201cIt was an \u2018Aha\u2019 moment for me,\u201d says the retired chef and restaurant owner, explaining that Bjork was stationed in Lisbon during the late 1970s and \u201chad regaled me with stories about his life there.\u201d The couple, who met when they were both in their 50s, initially bonded over their love for travel, and Wilson says that it\u2019s been a \u201cnever ending conversation\u201d ever since. \u201cWe started talking about our travels,\u201d she recounts. \u201cAnd we still are talking about our travels.\u201d Once they were married, Wilson and Bjork, who were based in Kansas at the time, began to think more seriously about the type of life that they wanted to have during their retirement years. \u201cWe were both watching our parents spend their entire savings and pensions on medical care,\u201d says Wilson, explaining that they did a lot of research into the cost of living in Portugal and found it to be more favorable. \u201cAnd, in Portugal, we could keep our money for travel. We were required to have private medical insurance as part of the visa process. \u201cBut we also would have access to the national system, particularly for hospitalizations.\u201d Wilson and Bjork, who previously ran a food truck named LumpiaPalooza and the Parsnipity Cafe in Wichita, Kansas, initially gave themselves six years \u201cto plan and dream about moving to Portugal.\u201d However, they opted to speed things up \u201crather than to go into debt to keep the business alive\u201d during the pandemic. \u201cWe decided to retire two years early,\u201d explains Wilson. \u201cSo we retired in 2020 and started the paperwork.\u201d The couple applied for a D7 visa, also known as the \u201cRetirement visa,\u201d which required them to meet specific requirements, including either proof of purchase of a property in the country or a rental agreement of at least 12 months. Community spirit They put a lot of time and energy into choosing which town to live in, eventually settling on the small town of Marinha Grande, located on the Silver Coast close to famed surfing beach Nazare. Wilson explains that they were keen to move somewhere that they could integrate themselves into the local community and spend time with Portuguese people rather than other Americans. \u201cMany people moving to Portugal like to call themselves \u2018expats\u2019 and spend their time at \u2018Meetups\u2019 where they can whine to other \u2018expats\u2019 about how no one in Portugal speaks English, how they can\u2019t find their exact brand of tinned beans and accuse the \u2018natives\u2019 of being impossible to get to know,\u201d she says. \u201cThis was not the life we wanted. We wanted to be immigrants, people moving to a new country to become a part of their culture and community.\u201d Once their visa had been approved and border restrictions had lifted, the couple moved to Marinha Grande, which has a population of just under 40,000, in January 2022. They initially stayed in an Airbnb, which cost them around $800 per month, and soon found themselves hosting some of the friends they\u2019d connected with via a town Facebook page before traveling over. \u201cI was cooking dinner out of our Airbnb two or three times a week for my Portuguese friends,\u201d says Wilson, before adding that they were warmly received by the locals, who seemed intrigued by them. \u201cPeople never pegged us as Americans,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cI think they can\u2019t peg us at all. We seldom get guessed as Americans, and we\u2019re fine with that.\u201d As the couple began to settle into their new lives, Wilson, who describes herself as an \u201cover-achiever,\u201d struggled with having so much time on her hands. Early retirement \u201cRetirement\u2019s been hard for me,\u201d she admits. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a \u2018Type A\u2019 person. My entire life has been work, work, work. I have a list and I live by the list. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s like, I don\u2019t even know what day of the week it is. And that\u2019s been a struggle. \u201cBut I\u2019m in the right place for that. Because that\u2019s kind of OK here. No one looks down at me because I\u2019m not racing all over the world and achieving, achieving and achieving.\u201d Wilson and Bjork are both currently taking Portuguese language classes provided by the government. However, Wilson admits that she hasn\u2019t found learning a new language easy. \u201cPortuguese, the language is very hard,\u201d says Wilson, explaining that she speaks Japanese and Spanish as well as \u201ctourist German, Danish and French.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m really good at languages. But Portuguese is a challenge to learn. \u201cWe don\u2019t find it easy. We find it manageable. Some people, especially people our age, don\u2019t find it manageable.\u201d The couple have also had to change the way that they approach people, particularly while asking for things at shops, after noticing that their direct manner wasn\u2019t being received well. \u201cMy Portuguese friends taught me that you have to first recognize their humanity,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cAnd you do this by saying, \u2018Good morning. How are you?\u2019 And they say, \u2018I\u2019m well. Are you well?\u2019 And once you\u2019ve done that, it\u2019s like a magic key that will open good service up to you.\u201d Wilson goes on to explain that she finds this attitude refreshing, as the focus is firmly on people and personal relationships. \u201cTheir ethic is not job first, or money first,\u201d she adds. \u201cTheir ethic is family and leisure\u2026 \u201cSo that\u2019s refreshing, to see people valuing relationships above the rat race. The rat died here. There\u2019s no place for that.\u201d Wilson has warmly embraced the Portuguese way of life, particularly the focus on food, which has long been a big part of her life. \u201cThe people eat together all the time,\u201d she says. \u201cSunday is considered family day. So there\u2019s a big family meal at everybody\u2019s mom or dad\u2019s house and everybody gathers together and eats. \u201cPortuguese women my age are always cooking. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time with them learning Portuguese food.\u201d While Wilson and Bjork had originally planned to use Portugal as a \u201cjumping off point\u201d to travel around the rest of Europe, they\u2019ve been too busy dealing with all of the tasks that come with relocating to a new country to venture very far. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cFrom governmental stuff, getting your residency card. Then you have to transfer your driver\u2019s license and find a car [if you drive]. \u201cYou have to buy everything [for your house]. And you have to set up yourself with medical and utilities. Really, it\u2019s a huge process.\u201d Affordability factor When asked if she and her husband have found Portugal to be more affordable, Wilson points out that this is all relative to their own experiences, noting their Portuguese friends \u201cpush back a little\u201d if they comment on how much cheaper things are, as it\u2019s not necessarily cheap for them. \u201cWe made that mistake,\u201d she admits. \u201cWhen we first came, we were like, \u2018Oh it\u2019s practically free.\u2019 And we had to quit doing that, because it was offending them [their friends].\u201d She points out that what seems very affordable to them, may not be to affordable to a Portuguese worker earning minimum wage. \u201cA lot of people make minimum wage,\u201d she adds. \u201cSo that being said\u2026 Yes. For Americans, it is cheaper to live here, if you don\u2019t live in Lisbon, Porto or the Algarve. \u201cThose places are like trying to live in San Francisco or Manhattan. Those are expensive cities. \u201cSo if you have your heart set on living in one of those places, you\u2019re going to pay three times what we pay, probably. In rent, food, everything.\u201d During their time in Portugal, the pair have adopted two rescue cats, grandly named Rainha Doce Florabela de Portugal and Rainha Joia Fofa Maria da Silva, through nonprofit organization The Kitten Connection. Wilson will be making snacks for an upcoming fundraising event for the organization and has also been giving regular cooking lessons to a local teenager. \u201cHe loves Asian food and it\u2019s not that easy to get here in Marinha Grande,\u201d she explains. \u201cSo we got the idea of him learning from me.\u201d She and her husband regularly host dinner parties, including an annual Thanksgiving celebration, and attend local events, such as children\u2019s concerts and sports games. Being a part of such a close-knit community has been a dream come true for Wilson, who says that they nearly always bump into someone they know while out and about. \u201cWe have been here for over two years and grow happier every day with our decision,\u201d adds Wilson. \u201cWe have a wealth of Portuguese friends who have helped us every step of the way and opened the doors to their homes and hearts to us.\u201d \u2018Zero problems\u2019 Wilson had become incredibly jaded by the political climate in the US before relocating, and was particularly concerned about gun violence. \u201cI tell people, \u2018We fled the country,\u201d she says. \u201cThe way everything was heading\u2026 We felt outraged and enraged every minute of the day.\u201d She hasn\u2019t been back for a visit since moving to Portugal and says she has no plans to ever return. \u201cI will return to the US in an urn. Period,\u201d she stresses. \u201cThere\u2019s literally nothing that would compel me to return to the US.\u201d While Wilson misses her family and friends, she says that she\u2019s an adventurer at heart and never intended to spend the rest of her days in America. \u201cSome people asked how I could leave my children or what my children think about it.\u201d she says, stressing that her children are grown ups living their own lives. \u201cAnd I have traveled my whole life on my own, leaving my children and my husband to travel for two weeks a year, every year. Just because it was that important to me. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a little bit of a bohemian type of person. So my kids expected nothing less than [me] going out this way. Doing something odd.\u201d Wilson and Bjork say that they\u2019ve had \u201czero problems\u201d since relocating to Portugal and couldn\u2019t be happier. In fact, things have gone so well that others are sometimes skeptical when they recount their experiences. \u201cPeople are like, \u2018You just see everything through rose-colored glasses.\u2019 But everything is as perfect as I say,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cIt has unfolded without any problems for us. It doesn\u2019t happen that way for everyone \u2013 I know that. But I\u2019m going to celebrate what we got. And we got a great experience.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/portugal-american-woman-never-coming-back/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_new-delhi-iron-pillar-india-intl-hnk", "text": "Can an iron structure stand tall for 1,600 years without rusting, despite being exposed to the elements? It seems implausible, considering the supposed lack of technology at the time of its construction. Yet, inside New Delhi\u2019s UNESCO-listed Qutb Minar complex \u2013 a collection of historic monuments and buildings built in the early 13th century in the city\u2019s southern Mehrauli district \u2013 one mysterious structure stands as a testament to this very enigma. Visitors to the courtyard of the complex\u2019s Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque will immediately spot an imposing 7.2-meter, six-ton iron pillar with a decorative top that\u2019s even older than the complex. Remarkably, the pillar is now as pristine as the day it was forged, defying both age and environmental adversities, including the Indian capital\u2019s intense temperatures and increasing pollution. Dating back to the 5th century, its remarkable resilience continues to captivate travelers today. How has it defied corrosion for so long? Typically, iron and iron alloy structures exposed to the air or moisture oxidize over time, rendering them coated in rust unless they are protected, like the Eiffel Tower, by layers of special paint. Scientists both in India and abroad began studying the iron pillar in Delhi in 1912 to try to figure out why it hadn\u2019t corroded. It wasn\u2019t until 2003 that experts at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in the northern city of Kanpur cracked the mystery, revealing the answer in the journal Current Science. They found that the pillar, primarily made of wrought iron, has a high phosphorus content (about 1%), and lacks sulfur and magnesium, unlike modern iron. Additionally, ancient craftsmen used a technique called \u201cforge-welding.\u201d That means they heated and hammered the iron, keeping the high phosphorus content intact, a method uncommon in modern practices. Archeo-metallurgist R. Balasubramaniam, who authored the report, said that this unconventional approach contributed to the pillar\u2019s enduring strength. A thin layer of \u201cmisawite,\u201d a compound of iron, oxygen and hydrogen, was also found on the pillar\u2019s surface, he said. This layer is formed catalytically by the presence of high phosphorus in the iron and the absence of lime, thus further enhancing the pillar\u2019s durability. Balasubramaniam lauded the metallurgists for their ingenuity, describing the pillar as \u201ca living testament to India\u2019s ancient metallurgical prowess.\u201d Its durability is evidenced by historical accounts, including an incident in the 18th century when a cannonball fired at the pillar reportedly failed to break it, showcasing the impressive strength of this ancient monument. Today, the pillar serves as the emblem of scientific organizations like the National Metallurgical Laboratory and the Indian Institute of Metals. Myths and legends surround pillar\u2019s origin Beyond its metallurgical intrigue, the origin of the Iron Pillar is also veiled in mystery. One widely circulated account traces it back to the Gupta Empire, particularly under the reign of Chandragupta II, also known as Vikramaditya, around the 4th and 5th centuries. According to this tale, the pillar was erected in the Varah Temple of Udayagiri Caves, near Vidisha in Madhya Pradesh, as a victory monument dedicated to the Hindu deity Lord Vishnu. It\u2019s said to have once borne a statue of Garuda, the mythical eagle mount of Vishnu, on its top, though this figure has been lost to history. Another theory, proposed by heritage activist and educator Vikramjit Singh Rooprai, suggests it may have been bought by Var\u0101hamihira, a renowned astronomer in the court of King Vikramaditya. \u201cOne of his books, the \u2018Surya Siddhanta,\u2019 details methods for calculating celestial positions, eclipses, and other astronomical phenomena - and it is believed that he used a tall pillar in his calculations,\u201d says Vikramjit. \u201cTherefore, upon his migration from Vidisha to Mihirapuri (now Mehrauli), where he founded an observatory, there exists a likelihood that he brought the pillar with him for continued use in his studies and calculations.\u201d Additionally, some historical records credit notable figures like Raja Anangpal of the Tomar dynasty, and Muslim rulers such as Iltutmish and Qutbuddin Aibek, for the relocation of the pillar to the Qutb complex. It\u2019s also been mentioned in the arts. In the epic poem \u201cPrithviraj Raso,\u201d penned by Chand Bardai, a courtier in the Chahamana dynasty under King Prithviraj Chauhan, the Iron Pillar holds great significance. \u201cBardai describes the Iron Pillar in Raso as a nail holding the Earth on the hoof of Sheshnag, the serpent king in Hindu mythology,\u201d says Vikramjit. \u201cRaso recounts how Raja Anangpal tried to uproot this nail despite warnings from Brahmins of dire consequences. When it was pulled out, revealing a red base believed to be Sheshnag\u2019s blood, panic ensued, fearing Earth\u2019s destruction. Anangpal quickly ordered its reinstallation, but it was not properly secured, resulting in it becoming loose. Thus, Bardai suggests that this incident inspired the colloquial name \u2018Dilli\u2019 for Delhi, which is a pun on the word \u2018dhilli\u2019, meaning \u2018loose\u2019 in Hindi.\u201d Cultural significance and preservation efforts According to one legend, if you stand with your back against the pillar and wrap your arms around it, making sure your fingers touch each other, your wish will come true \u2013 a tradition that imbues the pillar with spiritual significance beyond its historical value. However, the ASI (Archeological Survey of India) has put a fence around the pillar to minimize human impact. Conservation architect and heritage expert, Pragya Nagar, finds the pillar\u2019s preservation remarkable within the complex, despite the demolition and reconstruction of its surroundings over the years. \u201cIf we do look at the technique that was used to create the pillar from a fresh perspective, beyond mere acknowledgment of its ancient origins, we may discover avenues to leverage similar methods for the development of sustainable material alternatives, considering the environmental harm associated with processes like metal extraction,\u201d she tells CNN. \u201cIt is imperative to look at history beyond relics and monuments that simply need to be conserved and marveled at, but as repositories of traditional knowledge and indigenous practices. This holistic approach has the potential to pave the way towards a more sustainable future.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/new-delhi-iron-pillar-india-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}

The board approved a plan to rename the airport on April 11. Following that vote, the City of San Francisco \u2013 which owns a trademark on \u201cSan Francisco International Airport\u201d \u2013 filed a lawsuit on April 18 to prevent the alleged infringement after it said it offered to work with Oakland on alternative names, the city attorney\u2019s office said. The federal suit alleges Oakland plans to \u201cintentionally and knowingly capitalize off of confusion.\u201d In Thursday\u2019s news release, Port Commission President Barbara Leslie said the board \u201ccame to these discussions with a shared love of Oakland and a desire to see our city and airport thrive.\u201d \u201cSince our initial vote, the Port has met with dozens of community leaders and stakeholders and heard their concerns. We are moving forward with a commitment to honoring our past while building a stronger, more inclusive future,\u201d Leslie said. On Tuesday, City Attorney of San Francisco David Chiu had urged the commissioners to reconsider the renaming, adding his office would otherwise move forward with the lawsuit. The city plans to seek a preliminary injunction, a news release from the City Attorney said, alleging the name change \u201cwill very likely cause widespread confusion, mishaps, and economic loss for travelers.\u201d \u201cThe renaming plan appears intentionally designed to divert travelers who may be unfamiliar with Bay Area geography and lead them to believe OAK has a business relationship with SFO, which it does not,\u201d the release said. Following Thursday\u2019s vote, City Attorney of San Francisco spokesperson Jen Kwart said in a statement, \u201cIt is disappointing that Oakland chose to ignore our multiple offers to collaborate on alternative names and avoid litigation. We have no choice but to move forward with next steps in our trademark lawsuit.\u201d The Port of Oakland said Thursday the name change aims to increase passenger growth as travelers may currently be unaware of the airport\u2019s proximity to the region\u2019s attractions, such as the San Francisco Bay Area\u2019s universities, wine country, national laboratories and the cities of San Francisco and Berkeley. \u201cOAK is the closest major airport to 58 percent of the Bay Area population. The combined population of the counties closest to OAK is 4.1 million compared with 1.5 million in San Francisco and San Mateo counties,\u201d Interim Director of Aviation Craig Simon said in the release. \u201cThis designation will let the world know who we serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/travel/oakland-airport-name-lawsuit-san-francisco/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "2024_04_17_travel_lion-cafe-classical-tokyo-kissa-hnk-intl", "text": "Walking into the Lion Cafe, in Tokyo\u2019s Shibuya district, the first thing one notices is the seating. All chairs face one direction, towards two gigantic speakers on the wall, the stars of this 98-year-old institution. It\u2019s one of the city\u2019s few remaining meikyoku kissa, or masterpiece caf\u00e9s. \u201cMeikyoku kissa is a place that plays classical music, where customers can listen to music, have a drink and relax,\u201d says Naoya Yamadera, the current manager of the Lion Cafe. His father, Yanosuke Yamadera, built the original in 1926. It burned down during World War II air raids and was rebuilt and expanded in the 1950s, the decor inspired by its original European Baroque style. Beyond its stone-walled fa\u00e7ade, the cafe\u2019s interior is dimly lit, featuring dark wood and carved reliefs. Unlike most cafes, socializing here is discouraged. Talking on mobile phones is forbidden. When asked to explain why all the seats only face one way, Yamadera says it allows them to offer a more realistic concert experience, as though they\u2019re facing \u201can actual orchestra.\u201d \u201cIt was designed to immerse you in the image of listening to an orchestral performance,\u201d he says. The sound system was custom-made for the space in 1950, embedded into the two-story-high wall at the front of the caf\u00e9. Rows of vinyl records and CDs fill the shelves and racks beneath the speakers \u2013 they\u2019ve got more than 5,000 of each in total, according to Yamadera. Customers can request certain classical pieces from the store\u2019s collection \u2013 unless they\u2019re in the middle of a set playlist. A new fan base emerges Yamadera says he spent his much of childhood in the caf\u00e9. He joined the staff when he was in junior high school, starting as a dishwasher. Throughout the years the caf\u00e9 has changed very little, which Yamadera thinks is its biggest charm. \u201cIn the beginning, the music equipment was expensive. We were doing it at a time when there were no such electrical goods,\u201d says the owner. \u201cThere was a time when the caf\u00e9 operated on a manual (hand-cranked phonograph), which was expensive even in the past, so only a small percentage of people could buy one individually.\u201d This allowed Lion Cafe to lure customers to experience what was a rare form of entertainment at the time. \u201cListening to music was the latest trend, like fashion,\u201d says Yamadera. \u201cFor old customers who were in Tokyo as students and then went to the countryside, they come back here for the first time in 30, 40 or 50 years. The store is still unchanged after such a long time. The customers leave with a good feeling and that is what\u2019s good about this cafe.\u201d He says some of their oldest customers have been visiting the cafe for more than six decades. \u201c(One of our customers) is about 70 years old now, they started coming as a third-year high school student,\u201d says the 62-year-old manager. In recent years, the unique cafe has grown increasingly popular and attracted international attention, too. \u201cThere are quite a lot of newcomers. Many people are not familiar with classical music, so I\u2019d like them to get used to it in places like here,\u201d says Yamadara. \u201cSome of our customers come from as far away as America and Europe. Some also come from all over Japan. They look at guidebooks and see this place as a destination, so I would like to introduce the caf\u00e9 to these people.\u201d After working and DJing at the classical caf\u00e9 for decades, Yamadera says he doesn\u2019t have a single favorite classical piece, but there are a few standouts. \u201cI think I like the most familiar songs. On December 30th and 31st, the chorus of Beethoven\u2019s Symphony No. 9 will be played for a scheduled concert. This one is the most memorable for me,\u201d says Yamadera.

{"id": "travel_article_eva-longoria-searching-for-mexico-restaurants", "text": "You\u2019ll no doubt be hungry after watching \u201cEva Longoria: Searching for Mexico.\u201d Every episode is full of mouthwatering regional specialties prepared by chefs all over the country. For those wanting to follow in Eva Longoria\u2019s footsteps, below is a guide to the restaurants and locations she visited. Veracruz: Cradle of Mexican gastronomy Longoria visits the coastal state of Veracuz. Its position along some 400 miles (645 kilometers) of the Caribbean Sea made it a focal point for military conflict \u2013 and the collision of food cultures. \u201cThe people of Veracruz took this treasure trove of ingredients passing in and out of the port and created a whole new cuisine,\u201d Longoria said. \u2022 Longoria met chef Erik Guerrero, who aims to make fishing more sustainable in Veracruz, at Namik restaurant, where they enjoyed ceviche with hot beans and soft shell crab taco. \u2022 Next up, she joined actor and friend Ana de la Reguera for some coffee at historic Caf\u00e9 La Parroquia, Veracruz Port. Tap on the glass three times to ring for milk. \u2022 She headed to the lush inland mountains to meet coffee farming expert Itzel Mendoza at Cafetal Privado en Coetzala to learn how the precious bean is grown. There, they gathered flowers in the fields to be added to chicken stew, a salsa and a palm flower fritter. \u2022 Back in Veracruz Port, she met food historian Nidia Hern\u00e1ndez Medel at Chuchumb\u00e9, a cultural center, to cook some fried yucca, which is traced back to the city\u2019s African slave era.  \u2022 It\u2019s back out of the city to meet with vanilla farmer Norma Gaya, of Gaya Vanilla and Spices, for some vanilla chicken. \u2022 At El Tajin ruins, a Totonac settlement, Longoria met cook Do\u00f1a Marta. She\u2019s the founder of Smoke Women, which keeps ancient Totonac traditions alive. They enjoyed alcamaya (fresh-water shrimp) stew and mushroom empanadas. \u2022  Chef Luis Palmeros, a rising star on the Mexican food scene, introduces Longoria to traditional cook Do\u00f1a Rocio at Cuarto Blanco Market in the inland city of Xalapa (the capital of Veracruz state), for a traditional stuffed jalape\u00f1o. He then takes Longoria to his restaurant, El Cuarto Blanco, for his modern take on the dish. Jalisco: Birthplace of traditions \u2022 At Tortas Ahogadas El Pr\u00edncipe Heredero in Guadalajara, Longoria samples a torta ahogada \u2013 the region\u2019s beloved \u201cdrowned\u201d sandwich. \u2022 In Guadalajara\u2019s Santa Teresita neighborhood, Longoria samples a new preparation of native ingredient chinchayote at Xokol, a restaurant run by chefs \u00d3scar Segundo and Xrysw Ruelas D\u00edaz. \u2022 Longoria attends a charreada, a Mexican rodeo, that takes place at Lienzo Charro Charros De Jalisco. Afterward, she sampled birria, the celebrated goat stew from Jalisco, at the clubhouse. \u2022 Chef Fabian Delgado Padilla treats Longoria to mole with pork belly at his restaurant palReal in Guadlajara\u2019s Colonia Americana neighborhood. \u2022 At Lake Chapala, about 30 miles south of Guadalajara, Longoria meets with members of one of the oldest indigenous groups in Mexico, the Coca people, to talk about their fight to preserve their way of life and history on the lake. They feast on local fish called charales. \u2022 Longoria meets friends Mariana Padilla and Alejandra Pelayo at traditional cantina La Iberia in Guadalajara. Women weren\u2019t allowed in cantinas until the 1980s, Longoria said. \u2022 Then she heads to to the town of Tequila, where Salvador Rosales Trejo shows her how tequila is produced by Tequila Cascahuin using traditional methods. \u2022 Longoria and chef Fabian Delgado Padilla visit Yunaites, his casual restaurant inside a municipal market in Guadalajara, for gorditas topped with pork and mole. Nuevo Le\u00f3n: Where beef is king Say adios to vegetables for a while. Nuevo Le\u00f3n is the land of meat. In this state in northeast Mexico, carne asada is a go-to meal. And it\u2019s the cuisine Longoria grew up with in Texas.  \u2022 In Monterrey, Longoria met up with Alejandro Guti\u00e9rrez, founder of the Mexican Society of Grill Masters, to try the region\u2019s specialty: carne asada (grilled meat). In August, there\u2019s a grill master competition in Santiago, outside of Monterrey. \u2022 Tacos Do\u00f1a Mary La Gritona has been serving breakfast tacos in Monterrey for nearly 20 years. \u201cThese are the best tortillas I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d said Longoria. \u2022 El Jonuco restaurant celebrates the products of Nuevo Le\u00f3n with a focus on seasonal ingredients. They\u2019re known for their cabrito (roasted goat). The restaurant celebrates the little-known history of crypto-Judaism in the region, Longoria said. \u2022 Dona Lupita\u2019s Caf\u00e9, located in the backyard of her home right next to Highway 85 south of Monterrey, is famed for its legendary tamales. \u2022 La Divinita bakery is one of the most successful bakery chains in Monterrey. The founder uses local oranges to make a traditional dessert with Longoria. \u2022 Koli restaurant, run by the three Rivera Rio brothers, is a fine dining restaurant that aims to tell the story of Nuevo Le\u00f3n. Oaxaca: A gastronomic capital Nestled within three vast mountain ranges, Oaxaca is a magnet for food lovers in the know.  A thrill of any visit here is sampling the moles, as well as dishes such as tlayudas (thin Oaxacan \u201cpizzas\u201d), spicy hot chocolate and asado grilled in smoky market stalls. \u201cIt is on another level gastronomically, one of the best places I\u2019ve been to in the world,\u201d Longoria said. \u2022 Mercado de Abastos is a giant market on the edge of Oaxaca City. If you want your chocolate fix, the mercado is still the place to come. This region is known for its moles \u2013 complex sauces featuring many blended ingredients.  \u2022 Casa Oaxaca makes Oaxaca\u2019s famous mole negro drizzled over turkey breast. Longoria called it a magnificently complex and sophisticated sauce. \u2022 At Las Quince Letras, chef Celia Flori\u00e1n made Longoria quesillo \u2013 a stretched Oaxacan cheese --  with crickets and edible flowers. \u2022 In the area of Oaxaca located on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, several muxes, who identify as a third gender and are guardians of Zapotecan cuisine, cooked up stuffed pork with pineapple served alongside pureed potatoes. Longoria called it \u201cthe perfect combination.\u201d \u2022 The farming town of Santa Ana Zegache is the unassuming epicenter of corn. Corn has been worshipped for over 6,000 years and is still the beating heart of Mexican cuisine.  \u2022 In San Baltazar Chichicapam, Longoria visited a palenque (agave farm) run by Do\u00f1a Berta, one of very few female mezcaleras. The farm produces mezcal, the smoky liquor for which this region is famed. \u2022 La Cocina de Humo is a hip restaurant using local ingredients. Chef Thalia Barrios Garc\u00eda is known for her heirloom tomato salad with beet puree and herbal dressing. Longoria said it\u2019s the \u201cperfect dish.\u201d Here\u2019s the recipe.   Yucat\u00e1n: Defined by the Maya Mayan DNA runs through the recipes in Yucat\u00e1n, which has the largest Maya population in Mexico.  The state is located along the Gulf of Mexico and is surrounded by dense forests that isolate it off from the rest of the country. The Maya thrived here for thousands of years before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors in the 1500s. The region\u2019s geography and turbulent history have had a significant impact on the cuisine. \u2022 Ixi\u2019im mixes modern and ancestral techniques and flavors. The restaurant has its own version of the most famous dish from the Yucat\u00e1n, cochinita pibil. Chef Luis Ronz\u00f3n slow-cooks pork underground after it\u2019s marinated in sour orange and spices.  \u2022 Condimentos Enrique is a family-run business that sells recados (spice pastes) in Mercado de Santiago in M\u00e9rida. \u2022 At Huniik, which means \u201cunique spirit\u201d in Maya, chef Roberto Sol\u00eds makes onion tempura with black recado. \u201cI have never had anything like this. This is gorgeous, and it\u2019s delicious,\u201d said Longoria.  \u2022 In his home in Xoc\u00e9n, chef Alberto Kuku prepared one of the oldest dishes, Mayan chicken tamales, for Hanal Pix\u00e1n, a holiday celebrated by the Maya people that means \u201cfood for the souls.\u201d The food honoring the dead \u201ccan easily be carried back to the underworld,\u201d he said. \u2022 Chef Regina Escalante, who runs Merci in M\u00e9rida, showed Longoria how to make grilled seabass with mango, avocado and flor de sal. \u201cI\u2019d have this as my last meal on Earth,\u201d said Longoria. Here\u2019s the recipe. \u2022 At Uxmal, Mayan archaeologist Don Pepe cooked up smoked pork and bean stew. It cooks underground for 12 hours.  \u2022 Kinich in Izamal is famous for its queso relleno. A key ingredient is, surprisingly, Dutch cheese. See how it\u2019s made:  Mexico City: The city of tacos \u201cIt\u2019s crazy, it\u2019s crowded, it\u2019s noisy \u2013 and I love it!\u201d Longoria said as she walked the streets of Mexico City, where she lives part-time with her family. This region was once the capital of the mighty Aztec empire, known as Tenochtitl\u00e1n until the Spanish invaded about 500 years ago and changed its name to Mexico City. Here are the places Eva Longoria visited in the episode: \u2022 Tomasa is a Mexican bakery known for its conchas, a fluffy sweet bread with a crunchy topping.  \u2022 El Huequito in the Historic Center serves up delicious al pastor tacos, which are a staple in Mexico City. \u2022 Tacos Los Alexis is sizzling hot in the taco world. Owner Alexis Ayala uses his five-star culinary training to transform traditional recipes from his childhood into to-die-for gourmet tacos.  \u2022 Contramar in Roma, the bohemian part of town, is one of Longoria\u2019s favorite restaurants. Owner and chef Gabriela C\u00e1mara made her signature dish: pescado a la talla. \u2022 M\u00e1ximo Bistrot, a gourmet restaurant that marries French and Mexican cuisine, is run by chef Eduardo \u201cLalo\u201d Garc\u00eda. For Longoria, he made a roasted beet salad with rocket and wilted purslane. Best known as a weed, purslane is nonetheless edible and very nutritious. \u2022 Mercado de Jamaica is one of hundreds of markets in the city. At the street food stalls, Longoria tried green chorizo tacos and tlacoyos, thick oval-shaped tortillas typically stuffed with beans or cheese. \u2022 Casa Tochan refugee shelter is the first shelter for immigrants in Mexico City. The residents cook dishes from their homeland to share with their housemates.  \u2022 El Moro is an institution famous for its churros and chocolate. \u2022 Hiyoko restaurant in Little Tokyo cooks up a Mexican-Japanese fusion. Chef and restaurateur Edo L\u00f3pez whipped up tapioca tostadas, chicken skewers with ants and duck donburi.

{"id": "travel_cancun-mexico-cenotes-mayan-temples", "text": "Cancun. It\u2019s all just sun, sand and partying, right? Well, wrong. This famous tourist hotspot on the Yucatan Peninsula may have become a byword for excess, but from Lucha Libre to Mayan history to the natural beauty of its nearby jungles, Cancun offers so much more than a beach vacation. Heading here right now is special too. It\u2019s 50 years since the first hotel opened in Cancun. Back in the early 1970s, this was an empty, beautiful stretch of coastline, save for a small fishing village. The boom here, though, was not organic, but actually part of a plan to create what the Mexican government at the time dubbed a \u201cmultimillion-dollar playground.\u201d That plan, called The Cancun Project, gained approval in 1969 and ground was broken in 1970, with the purpose of building a new city from scratch. It would feature an area still known as the Hotel Zone, a part of town for local residents and workers to live and an airport for flying in people desperate for good weather and a good time. Quintana Roo, which became a Mexican state in 1974, the same year that first hotel opened, is now home to a series of resorts, of which Cancun is the original. Fast-forward and Cancun has become a runaway success. Some 21 million visitors headed here in 2023, beating tourism ministry projections and reminding everyone that it is Mexico\u2019s ultimate must-see. Wrestling with the past A night out on the town in Cancun doesn\u2019t have to involve shots, bashing each other with balloons and dancing in the street, although all of these things have their place. For something truly local, it\u2019s best to get sporty, with a night of Lucha Libre, Mexican wrestling. A sport with a massive fanbase, wrestlers known as Luchadores wrestle in masks which, when they lose, they can never wear again. It all makes for a colorful but brutal experience, one you can\u2019t help but enjoy, whether it\u2019s wrestlers being chucked out of the ring or the delicious tamales you get to snack on before showtime. While this historic form of entertainment, which goes way back into the 1900s, offers visitors a glimpse of local culture, there\u2019s something even older to marvel at in Cancun. Thousands of years before Cancun\u2019s arrival on the tourist scene, the Mayan Empire built temples and cities here, their ruins still visible between the pyramid-like hotels which ape their original design. Diving into history To truly get to grips with the highly developed civilization which grew up here, it pays to go deep into the jungle. To Puerto Morelos and its iconic cenotes. These deep sinkholes, found throughout this part of Mexico, formed during the last ice age, when weakened limestone collapsed, offering up the only source of freshwater in the forest. The word is derived from the Mayan language, whose people believed that they were sacred spaces, a way to access the underworld. \u201cThey call it Xibalba,\u201d explains Roberto Rojo, a biologist and founder of Cenotes Urbanos, a nonprofit conservation organization. \u201cXibalba, that\u2019s the Mayan word for the underworld\u2026 it\u2019s not like hell. It\u2019s just another place in their universe. \u201cMany of the pyramids or the temples are built over a cenote or a cave, or very close to these places, because they were very important for them.\u201d So important, in fact, that whole cities and temples, like Chichen-Itza, designated one of the new seven wonders of the world in 2000, were built around them. Sacrifices were made too, with animals thrown deep into the water to appease the Mayans gods. At Cenote Zapote, in Puerto Morelos, it\u2019s even possible to dive to the bottom and catch sight of something that\u2019s been there for over 10,000 years. \u201cThis is a very special cenote because down there at the bottom [there is] a full skeleton of a big giant ground sloth that lived here during the ice age,\u201d says Rojo. A spiritual experience The peninsula\u2019s jungle also holds other secrets. Two hours from Cancun, in Tulum, hides a museum and arts center that is unusual, topsy-turvy and downright trippy. SFER IK opened in 2019. It\u2019s part museum, part gallery and part jungle, at one with its surroundings, with no flat floors or ceilings, constructed from local timber, vines and even living trees. The brainchild of architect and philanthropist Eduardo Neira Sterkel, also known simply as Roth, it\u2019s designed to bring visitors closer to nature and the beauty of the forest of the Yucatan. It does so in truly one-off style, from its undulating walkways to the way in which vines droop across paths, the trees soaring above. Roth explains that, with 200 trees making up SFER IK, it is a way of bringing nature into the everyday. \u201cI think that nature is the last resource we have, we have to take care of nature,\u201d he says, when asked about why creating this amazing space was so important to him. It\u2019s undoubtedly somewhere that you can feel calm and content, at one with the world around you. It is not the Cancun that is known for its hectic party scene. Far, far from it. Likewise, the healing powers of a Tamazcal Ceremony stand apart from the stereotypes associated with the region. This ancient Mayan tradition is still practiced in the jungle around Cancun today, a chance to relax, detox and purify among the greenery. There are even real local shamans on hand to lead the ceremony in the Temazcal, a stone igloo within which sits a hot fire. Think of it like a jungle sauna. The darkness of the space is designed to break down barriers between people, with ceremonies lasting up to eight hours which involve sharing feelings and thoughts. \u201cThis is very good for our body; we are healing, detoxing,\u201d explains the shaman from inside the Temazcal. It\u2019s believed the Mayans took part in such ceremonies after battle or court competition. Thousands of years ago, they, like so many ancient civilizations all over the globe, understood the power of mindfulness. The old, the new and everything in between While natural wonders draw tourists away from Cancun, the rain, which arrives here more often than you think, drives tourists indoors, into the town\u2019s myriad malls. This might be modern-day Mexico, but the souvenirs here have a distinctly Mayan bent, from the local handicrafts to the temple-covered fridge magnets. Mercifully, the sun is never far away, meaning there\u2019s time to simply marvel at the turquoise waters, the boats skimming the surface, the birds dotting the sky. There\u2019s simply no getting away from the fact that this is an extremely beautiful corner of the world. Like the Mayans, the visionaries of modern-day Cancun knew what they were doing when they created this tourist delight. Today it is a heady blend of the old and new, a remarkable place that is well worth exploring, from its beaches to its bars, its cenotes to its jungle delights.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/cancun-mexico-cenotes-mayan-temples/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_lawsons-fujikawaguchiko-japan-overtourism-intl-hnk", "text": "One week after a small Japanese town announced it was taking unorthodox measures to prevent overtourism at a popular selfie spot, a business caught up in the controversy has made a statement. Lawson\u2019s, one of Japan\u2019s largest convenience store chains, has an outpost in the small town of Fujikawaguchiko. The town in Yamanashi prefecture is well known among tourists due to its location at the beginning of one of the most popular hiking trails up Mount Fuji \u2013 and, now, for its beautiful views of the mountain. Tourists have flooded into Fujikawaguchiko to take one specific picture \u2013 a shot of Mount Fuji behind a Lawson\u2019s store, where the mountain\u2019s classic elegance contrasts with the store\u2019s modern neon signage. This photo vantage spot has become so popular that Fujikawaguchiko is now taking a drastic step \u2013 erecting a barrier to block the view of the mountain to deter would-be picture-takers. Although Lawson\u2019s has not encouraged visitors to take pictures of its store, the company nevertheless issued a statement addressing the issue on May 5. \u201cWe offer our sincere apologies to local residents, customers of these stores, and others for inciting inconvenience and concern due to the popularization of the Lawson Kawaguchiko Station Branch,\u201d the statement reads. And while the town of Fujikawaguchiko is already building the eight-foot-tall barrier that will go up behind the store, Lawson\u2019s says it will take its own steps to prevent bad tourist behavior by putting up signs in multiple languages that warn visitors against littering, blocking traffic and more. In addition, Lawson\u2019s says it has considered hiring private security to manage the store and surrounding area. While simply taking a picture may not seem like a life-altering issue, officials recently told CNN the huge increase in tourists \u2013 and their attendant bad behavior \u2013 has wreaked havoc on tiny Fujikawaguchiko. During peak season, it is common for the town to have three times as many visitors as residents. Many of the photographers who set up their gear in front of Lawson\u2019s leave trash, prevent residents from moving around freely, and stand in the road, which can block traffic and cause accidents, said an unnamed official. Several owners of businesses near the Lawson\u2019s went to the city council with complaints. Fujikawaguchiko is one of many places in Japan coping with overtourism. The country fully reopened post-pandemic in late 2022, leading to a surge of rescheduled trips and \u201crevenge travel.\u201d March 2024 was Japan\u2019s highest tourism month on record, with the country welcoming more than three million travelers. Many of them headed to the same destinations, crowding Kyoto\u2019s narrow streets and the walking trails of Mount Fuji. The damage to Mount Fuji, called Fuji-san in Japanese, has been so significant that local leaders are pushing for stronger measures to regulate tourism at the UNESCO World Heritage site. In 2023, a Yamanashi prefectural government official told CNN that overtourism was the single biggest problem on Fuji-san. In addition to the sheer number of additional bodies, he expressed concern about the problems that come along with more visitors, including erosion, litter, increased carbon emissions and environmental damage caused by hikers who go off marked trails. And Lawson\u2019s is not the only Japanese tourist destination that has resorted to putting up signs warning visitors of bad behaviors. In Kyoto\u2019s historic Gion neighborhood, throngs of tourists cramming the tiny alleys in hopes of spotting a geisha on her way to work have caused clashes between visitors and locals. The local Gion council has put up signs and handed out brochures explaining that behaviors like following geisha, taking pictures of them without asking permission and pulling on their kimonos are disrespectful, but \u201cgeisha paparazzi\u201d continues regardless. No one has a perfect answer for how Japan can cope with overtourism. But Fujikawaguchiko expects to have its picture-blocking barrier in place by the end of the month.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/lawsons-fujikawaguchiko-japan-overtourism-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_dubai-mangroves-design-spc", "text": "A stretch of more than 70 kilometers (43 miles) of shoreline in Dubai could become the site of the \u201cworld\u2019s largest coastal regeneration project,\u201d if a project called Dubai Mangroves were to go ahead. Over 100 million mangroves \u2014 a group of trees and shrubs that live mainly in coastal waters, where they are able to support entire ecosystems \u2014 would be planted as part of the project. That\u2019s enough to absorb over 1.2 million metric tons of CO2 per year, according to URB, the sustainable city developer behind the initiative \u2014 the equivalent of removing 260,000 gas-powered vehicles from the road. \u201cMangroves are nature\u2019s own defense system against coastal erosion and rising sea levels, which are crucial concerns for any coastal city, including Dubai,\u201d says Baharash Bagherian, an urban planner and founder of URB. \u201cCurrently, we\u2019re in the research phase,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe have identified six locations for proposed pilot studies as next stages and are focusing on the designs for those locations. We envision the project\u2019s completion by 2040.\u201d Better than a rainforest URB\u2019s other designs, which are all still in the planning phase, include a masterplan to equip Dubai with over 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) of cycling lanes by 2040, and Dubai Reefs, a floating community for marine research and ecotourism that would include the world\u2019s largest artificial reef. Dubai Mangroves was originally proposed as part of Dubai Reefs, and later singled out as a separate initiative. According to Bagherian, it\u2019s meant to address several environmental and urban challenges. \u201cPrimarily, it aims to combat the effects of climate change,\u201d he says, which is achieved via the mangroves\u2019 natural ability to mitigate sea level rise \u2014 by gradually creating a buffer between sea and land \u2014 and their ability remove carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere. Mangroves are able to do this 10 times faster than mature tropical forests and they can then store the carbon three to five times more densely, according to the US National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration. They bring other benefits, too, as they act as nurseries for marine life and create a natural habitat for fish, birds and other plants, increasing biodiversity. They also directly improve the economy of coastal communities by supporting fisheries and aquaculture, as well as providing raw materials for crafts and construction. Finally, as demonstrated by other mangrove hotspots around the world, they can become a tourist attraction. \u201cThe project is set to raise the bar for ecologically responsible tourism, by creating an environment where visitors can enjoy nature without harming it,\u201d Bagherian says, adding that the goal is not only to attract tourists but to encourage them to become active participants in preserving the natural heritage. A conservation center staffed by marine biologists and a large botanical museum are among the facilities planned for the visitor hub. AI gardeners Technology will play a role in both the development and the operations of Dubai Mangroves, with artificial intelligence (AI) constantly checking over the plants. \u201cWe are looking at utilizing cutting-edge tools such as drone reforestation to plant mangroves efficiently and remote sensing technology to monitor the health and growth of the mangrove forests,\u201d says Bagherian. Drones would precisely place the mangrove seeds in locations where they have the best chance of survival. Satellite imagery would then be used to gain an overview of the mangrove coverage, making it easier to identify areas that require increased attention. At the same time, AI-driven analytics could process large chunks of data to offer guidance to biologists and urbanists on restoration efforts and policy decisions. Six areas are currently being considered for pilot studies that would inform the final plan for the project: Jebel Ali Beach, Dubai Marina Beach, Jumeirah Public Beach, Umm Suqeim Beach, Mercato Beach and Dubai Islands Beach.\u00a0 Bagherian believes that as well as tackling climate change and boosting the local economy through ecotourism, the project would improve quality of life for locals. \u201cOn a social level, it enhances urban liveability by offering recreational spaces for residents and visitors, improving air quality, and contributing to the mental and physical well-being of the community,\u201d he says.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/dubai-mangroves-design-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_article_chance-encounters-florence-italy-kacie-rose", "text": "Kacie Rose Burns walked into the Florence jazz bar, alone. \u201cI\u2019ll go for one song and suss it out,\u201d she thought, trying to quieten her nerves. Kacie slipped in at the back. The club was dark and busy, a few wall lights and neon signs illuminating people drinking, dancing and chatting. Before she could even take in the musicians on stage, Kacie\u2019s eyes landed on a tall man sitting at the bar. \u201cI walked in and he was there,\u201d Kacie tells CNN Travel today. \u201cWe clocked eyes.\u201d \u201cCiao,\u201d said the stranger, smiling. \u201cCiao,\u201d Kacie said back, before adding apologetically: \u201cThat\u2019s all the Italian I\u2019ve got for you.\u201d It was October 2018. Kacie was a 24-year-old New Yorker on vacation in Florence. It was her first time in Italy and her first time traveling solo. It was an exciting \u2013 and terrifying \u2013 experience. \u201cI was a professional dancer in New York,\u201d explains Kacie. \u201cA very exhausting career \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of toxicity, a lot of rejection, there\u2019s a lot of politics that come into play \u2013 and I was feeling a little stuck, a little unhappy, a little \u2013 just stagnant, if you will.\u201d Kacie spent her days auditioning, traveling for gigs and moonlighting at a clothing store. She needed a break, and she\u2019d long felt a \u201cpull\u201d to Italy and dreamed of an Italian vacation. \u201cI kept saying, \u2018I\u2019ll wait for somebody to go with, I\u2019ll wait, I\u2019ll wait. And then I was waiting for years. And so then one night \u2013 at two in the morning \u2013 I was like, \u2018What am I waiting for? Life is too short.\u2019 So I booked a solo trip to Italy.\u201d Kacie planned to spend the majority of her time in Rome and Venice and just a couple of days in Florence. But in the lead-up to the trip, she got chatting to a customer at the store she worked at. This woman had lived in Florence for five years and sung the Tuscan city\u2019s praises, persuading Kacie to add an extra day to her Florence stint. And that\u2019s how Kacie and the Italian stranger happened to be in the jazz club on the same evening. \u201cI\u2019m really glad that I listened to her,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cThat\u2019s the only reason why we met on the first night that I was in Florence, on that earlier day that I wasn\u2019t originally supposed to be there.\u201d A Florence meeting The man Kacie crossed paths with in the jazz bar was 26-year-old Dario Nencetti, a chef in a Florence hotel who usually worked nights. It just so happened that was the only evening he had off that week. The jazz bar, called Jazz Club Firenze, was one of Dario\u2019s favorite hangouts. He loved the music, the underground ambiance and the fact the bar encouraged punters to sign up for jam sessions. \u201cThat place is, let\u2019s say, unconventional for Florence,\u201d Dario tells CNN Travel. \u201cUsually in Florence, there\u2019s like a table for two or three or four people. In the jazz club, there are big tables, so you can sit with strangers and stuff, which I love.\u201d When Dario realized Kacie didn\u2019t know much Italian beyond \u201cciao,\u201d they switched to English. Dario told Kacie he\u2019d lived in Scotland for a year, and they got talking about travel. Kacie mentioned she was on her first solo trip and Dario said he\u2019d embarked on a similar adventure to Japan earlier that year. \u201cWe bonded from the beginning,\u201d says Dario. \u201cIt was really natural, really easy conversation.\u201d \u201cI remember he made me laugh,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Oh, this guy\u2019s interesting.\u201d So many people ask us, \u2018How did you know?\u2019 And I don\u2019t know how I knew. I was just like, \u2018Oh, this is something different.\u2019\u201d Kacie and Dario stayed at the jazz bar talking into the early hours of the morning. Then they spent as much time as possible together over the next two days. \u201cHe would meet me after his work \u2013 every night he got off at 11. And we would go out and we would just talk,\u201d recalls Kacie. \u201cI instantly fell in love with Florence. It\u2019s a very romantic city - cobblestone streets and medieval buildings. It looks like a painting everywhere you look.\u201d It was a whirlwind two days. One evening they sat by Florence\u2019s Ponte Vecchio bridge and talked until 3 or 4 a.m. It was as though Kacie was in a film \u2013 somewhere between every millennial\u2019s favorite \u201cThe Lizzie McGuire Movie\u201d and classic Florentine romance \u201cA Room with a View.\u201d Then, the two days were up and Kacie had to continue onto the next leg of her trip. It was still like something from a movie \u2013 only it wasn\u2019t obvious this one had a happy ending. \u201cI got on the train and he was standing on the platform. And I remember looking out the train, and I was so sad,\u201d she says. As the train pulled away from the station, Kacie wiped away tears and messaged her best friend back home in New York. \u201cI just met my future husband in Florence,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s the guy I\u2019m gonna marry. I\u2019m never gonna see him again.\u201d Her friend tried to cheer her up. \u201cYou\u2019re going to Rome,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYou\u2019ll meet a gladiator!\u201d But Kacie knew what she had with Dario wasn\u2019t replaceable. \u201cWe never stopped talking. We FaceTimed every single day,\u201d she says. This continued when Kacie was back in the US. And before long, Dario was planning a trip to visit New York. A New York minute On December 8, 2018 Dario arrived in the US. Kacie spent a week introducing Dario to her life in New York. \u201cIt was really cool to see it through his eyes,\u201d she says. \u201cShe showed me the real city,\u201d says Dario. Then the couple flew to Miami for a week\u2019s vacation. For Kacie and Dario, there was never a specific moment where they decided to embark on a relationship. \u201cIt was never a decision to be made,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cIt just went without saying,\u201d agrees Dario. \u201cBut I can\u2019t hide it, long distance was hard.\u201d The two struggled with time zones and their busy jobs that left them with little downtime, but tried to visit each other whenever they could. Cut to September 2019. Dario was back in New York visiting Kacie. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I move here?\u201d he suggested. He\u2019d loved the vibrancy of the city from the get-go and could see himself there. The restaurant scene was incredible. If he could find a job and organize the visa, it seemed like the ideal scenario. Kacie thought so too, so Dario started asking around. He was eventually hired as a chef at an Italian restaurant in Brooklyn. After a couple of months in limbo, his visa was approved. \u201cUp until that point, every time that we had to say goodbye it was borderline traumatic \u2013 we had spent this week together and we knew that this was it for each other,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cSaying goodbye in airports sucked. It would take like a week to recover.\u201d But now the airport goodbyes were consigned to the past. \u201cIt was really exciting,\u201d says Dario. Moving forward together Kacie and Dario spent three months in New York together, giddy with happiness to be in the same country and the same city. Then the pandemic hit. New York City\u2019s performing arts and restaurant industries ground to a halt. Stuck at home, Kacie and Dario found solace and support in one another. As Kacie puts it, she and Dario found \u201cmany silver linings\u201d in this tough time. Dario taught Kacie how to make pasta. They cat-sat. They spent long evenings chatting. But as 2020 rolled on, the couple were aware there was a deadline hanging over them. Dario\u2019s visa was set to run out in December and in the wake of the pandemic, renewal was out of the question. For Kacie and Dario, it seemed like there were only three viable choices: return to long distance, get married or move to Italy. Going back to long distance would mean the return of those airport goodbyes, the last thing either of them wanted. And while Kacie and Dario thought marriage was in their future, they didn\u2019t feel it was right for them at that point. That left moving to Italy. Kacie thought about her career in New York. Performing was off the table and there was no return date in sight. And while her friends were regularly posting on social media about how much they missed dancing, Kacie only felt \u201crelief\u201d that her days were no longer defined by auditioning and uncertainty. \u201cThat was a pretty big wake-up call,\u201d she says. \u201cI had gotten to a point where I needed to take a little step back from performing.\u201d On top of this, Kacie\u2019s New York apartment lease was up. If there was ever a time to relocate to Italy, it was now. \u201cEverything kind of fell into place,\u201d she says. Kacie researched online and found a language academy in Florence offering study visas. She applied, enrolling in Italian lessons. Then, Kacie and Dario packed up their life in New York and got ready to move across the Atlantic. Before stepping on the plane in January 2021, Kacie posted a video to TikTok about meeting Dario and the move to Italy. She\u2019d never posted much on the platform before, but felt inspired to mark this significant life step. When she stepped off the plane and connected to Wi-Fi, her cell phone was blowing up. \u201cIt went viral,\u201d says Kacie. While stuck inside during mandatory two-week quarantine, Kacie continued posting TikTok videos. Her following continued to grow. While her social media presence was getting bigger, for the first few months in Florence, Kacie and Dario\u2019s IRL world remained small. Italy was still in the thrall of Covid, with strict restrictions. But as Kacie studied for her Italian lessons and taught English online and Dario looked for restaurant work, Florence started to slowly reopen. \u201cI remember the first time going to the Duomo. And there was nobody there,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cWhich is crazy, because it\u2019s like the main focus point of Florence. And there\u2019s nobody in the piazza and I remember how bizarre that was.\u201d While that moment was surreal \u2013 even sad \u2013 Kacie and Dario still felt grateful to be at the Florentine landmark together. They\u2019d come a long way, and they were excited for their new life together in Italy. Acclimatizing to Italian life was made easier for Kacie by Dario\u2019s family, who welcomed her wholeheartedly \u2013 even if, in the early days, Kacie struggled with Italian and Dario\u2019s mother didn\u2019t know much English. The two women made communication work by using Google Translate on their cell phones. \u201cThey bonded immediately,\u201d says Dario. Kacie continued to post on social media, and her following ballooned. After about six months, she stopped teaching English online and decided to do social media full time. Dario encouraged this step. \u201cI think it was a really good idea diving into it,\u201d he says today. \u201cIt was the right moment, the right time, and I believed in her from the first moment.\u201d A life together in Italy Almost four years later, Kacie\u2019s expanded her social media presence into a travel company, running group tours around Italy and publishing her own travel guides. Meanwhile, Dario is still passionate about cooking and now works as a fine dining chef at a Florence restaurant. \u201cI really love the life we\u2019ve created here,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cWe live in a beautiful place with great food and he\u2019s got so many awesome things going for him and same with me.\u201d The couple encourage each other in their respective careers and endeavors, but they also savor their downtime. They love living in Florence and exploring Italy together. Dario and Kacie are settled in Florence for now, although they don\u2019t rule out a move elsewhere in the future. \u201cWe\u2019re enjoying the moment,\u201d says Dario. \u201cThe solid thing is the fact that we know we\u2019re in it together. And that\u2019s what makes it so great,\u201d says Kacie. She tells Dario: \u201cI\u2019m not nervous for what the future holds. Because I\u2019ve got you.\u201d Looking back, Kacie finds it serendipitous and surreal to think her spontaneous decision to travel solo in Italy led her to find a new career, a new home and the love of her life. \u201cThere were so many things that had to happen for it to actually happen, but it just felt normal and natural \u2013 like of course this is right and this was supposed to happen,\u201d she says. \u201cYou never really know what life has planned for you. There\u2019s so many good things waiting. You just have to trust it,\u201d adds Kacie. \u201cTrust in the process. And the path that is meant for you will happen, even if it\u2019s not the path that you intended to take for yourself.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/article/chance-encounters-florence-italy-kacie-rose/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_jd-power-2024-north-american-airline-satisfaction-survey-results", "text": "Airports are crammed, flight fares are up and airlines are looking ahead to a hectic summer. And all the while North American travelers are kind of dissatisfied \u2013 at least according to consumer research company J.D. Power\u2019s 2024 North American Airline Satisfaction Study. J.D. Power\u2019s annual survey asks passengers to rate an airline\u2019s staff; digital tools; ease of travel; overall trust levels; on-board experience; pre/post-flight experience; and overall value for money. This year\u2019s survey suggests \u201csome airlines\u201d are managing to deliver great customer experiences, as J.D. Power puts it, but the market is challenging \u2013 and even the high scores aren\u2019t especially high. Unlike in previous years, J.D. Power hasn\u2019t revealed an overall North American airline passenger satisfaction score, with Mike Taylor, travel intelligence lead at J.D. Power, telling CNN Travel they\u2019ve chosen instead \u201cto concentrate on who wins which seat class segment.\u201d Coming out top in this year\u2019s rankings for economy class air travel is Southwest Airlines, with an overall score of 685 out of 1,000. That\u2019s a win for Southwest, which also topped last year\u2019s economy rankings \u2013 although this year\u2019s winning score is considerably lower than 2023\u2019s 827 out of 1,000. Meanwhile in the premium economy rankings, Delta Air Lines grades highest, with 716 points. The airline also came in at number one for premium economy passengers in 2023, with a score of 848. Delta ranked highest in J.D. Power\u2019s 2024 first/business rankings too, with a score of 743. Last year, JetBlue came first in this category, with a score of 893. Changing criteria In general, comparisons to previous iterations of the survey aren\u2019t super helpful, as the report\u2019s been slightly rejigged this year. There are some new questions in the mix. And for the first time, rather than ranking each factor on a scale of 1 to 10, passengers were asked to use a six point \u201cpoor to perfect\u201d scale. \u201cRespondents are less likely to award a \u2018perfect\u2019 score which is why you see scores that are lower than last year,\u201d suggests Taylor. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean the airlines are doing worse, just reflects the scale change.\u201d With that in mind, J.D. Power suggests the main takeaway from this year\u2019s survey isn\u2019t lower scores, but the tangible difference made by well-trained airline staff. In the report summary, J.D. Power notes Southwest and Delta\u2019s \u201csignificantly higher scores in all areas where interpersonal interactions can make a difference\u201d and suggests these airlines \u201chave made substantial investments in the people side of their business.\u201d Taylor adds that these airlines \u201cspend a great deal of training time (or hiring efforts) to increase positive personal interaction among the flight attendants/gate crew and the flying public.\u201d \u201cWe see that sustained efforts in these areas seem to be paying off with greater satisfaction with the airline,\u201d he says. According to J.D. Power, this year\u2019s survey results also indicate that media coverage has a \u201cmajor influence\u201d on customer perceptions of airlines. If passengers read a \u201cnegative\u201d news story about an airline, they in turn view the carrier with a more skeptical eye, Taylor says. \u201cWe ask respondents if they remember seeing any news stories in the media about the airline, ask them to characterize the news as negative to positive and then correlate that to the level of trust with the airline,\u201d says Taylor, adding this is a \u201cnew set of questions\u201d added to the survey this year, so it\u2019ll be interesting to see how this trend develops in years to come. The 2024 J.D. Power study is based on responses from 9,582 passengers during the period spanning March 2023 to March 2024. All respondents had to have flown on a major North America airline within the month prior to completing their survey. According to Taylor, the report suggests that what passengers want more than anything is \u201ca safe, comfortable and time-efficient flight.\u201d Airlines can\u2019t control factors like the weather, but well-trained, friendly staff \u201ccreate happier and more loyal customers.\u201d \u201cIt makes a big difference,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cAnd can help airlines stand out in a competitive environment and when people are being picky with their spending.\u201d J.D.

{"id": "travel_thanda-island-private-luxury-tanzania-spc-intl", "text": "Thanda Island, a speck of sand off the Tanzanian coast, has room for only a handful of guests, but space enough for many thousands of inhabitants. A luxury estate which must be rented in its entirety, where prices start at $33,000 per night, you\u2019ll have to share this tropical hideaway with some of Mother Nature\u2019s most majestic creatures, including the largest fish in the sea, the whale shark. Located a 30-minute helicopter ride from Tanzania\u2019s biggest city, Dar es Salaam, Thanda sits amid a private marine reserve with a rigorous conservation and restoration program \u00ad\u2013 one that is already reaping rewards for visitors as well as the surrounding island communities. The brainchild of Swedish entrepreneurs Dan and Christin Olofsson, Thanda Island Hotel has been in operation since 2016. \u201cThey wanted to create the ultimate escape,\u201d says general manager Antigone Meda, who explains that multigenerational families and groups of friends are the island\u2019s typical guests, with most staying for five to eight nights. The island features a villa and two open-air beach chalets. \u201cThe villa was very inspired by the Kennedys\u2019 beach home,\u201d Meda says, referring to the compound in Cape Cod that belonged to the family of JFK. \u201cIt breeds beach romance, nostalgia, (with) a touch of East African flare.\u201d Thanda strives to be as self-sufficient as possible, she adds, with a seawater desalination plant on site, rainwater harvesting, and powered by the largest off-grid solar farm in Tanzania, she claims. Organic waste is turned into compost. But the hotel\u2019s sustainability credentials are only part of the allure for the environmentally conscious traveller. The island sits within Mafia Island Marine Park, and more specifically, Shungimbili Island Marine Reserve, which guests have exclusive use of during their stay. Beyond the island\u2019s white sand beaches, activities include jet skiing, jet boarding, kayaking, sailing, wind surfing and kite surfing. Diving and snorkelling are the most prized sports, however. Whale sharks, humpback whales and blacktip reef sharks are a short boat ride away. These species are being fostered by the island\u2019s conservation program, which started in 2017 with the hiring of a marine biologist, kickstarting a team that has expanded significantly since, including a partnership with the Tanzanian Marine Parks and Reserves Unit. The island itself has a protected turtle nesting area (five species live in the area, with green turtles hatching from 2017), but much of the work takes place at sea. Hassan Jumbe is the dive master at Thanda and works on its coral restoration project. A 10-minute boat ride from the island is a coral nursery tended by Jumbe, where found coral fragments are cut into smaller pieces and cemented to ropes hanging from floating pontoons, and allowed to grow. Another technique involves clipping small corals to the seabed, giving them space to grow. Jumbe started in 2022, and says in the island\u2019s immediate waters there \u201cwas not so many fish.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference now,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe have a very healthy reef and also a lot of fish around. So for the local people, they are so proud of it.\u201d \u201cThe ocean is our life\u201d The dive master explains that 90% of the nearby population, found primarily on Mafia Island, 16 nautical miles away, rely on fishing for a livelihood. While the private reserve is off limits, Jumbe says, the reefs allow a safe breeding space, with populations that spill out over a wider area beyond it, which can be fished in a more sustainable fashion. \u201cThe ocean is our life,\u201d Jumbe adds. \u201cA lot of people didn\u2019t realize how important the coral is.\u201d Meda says the project aims to cover and restore one hectare of reef over the next five years. \u201cI remember when I first came here, I would see one or two blacktip reef sharks. We now have a thriving population of them. You jump in the water and you could almost be surrounded,\u201d she says. One hundred and twenty individual whale sharks have been recorded in the waters, she adds. The benefits to tourism have been married to a number of projects engaging with the Mafia Island community. The majority of employees at Thanda Island come from the neighboring island, and Thanda supports a series of entrepreneurs and small businesses there, says Meda. Jumbe says other people from Mafia Island have been trained in open water diving and coral restoration. \u201cSome guests go as far as helping us with some of our projects on Mafia Island that we run,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey feel a sense of responsibility. It makes them happy that luxury travel can actually make a positive impact.\u201d Cherae Robinson, founder and CEO of luxury travel operator Tastemakers Africa, says Tanzania\u2019s \u201creally dynamic\u201d coastal region is on her radar. \u201c(A) holistic approach to sustainable tourism is really finding its foot(ing) on the continent, because so much of tourism on the continent is in connection with the environment. And so you\u2019re seeing sustainability really on the cutting edge in some places,\u201d she explains. The World Travel Awards has named Thanda Island the \u201cWorld\u2019s Leading Exclusive Private Island\u201d for the last eight years. Like the corals off its pristine shores, its reputation continues to grow and grow.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/thanda-island-private-luxury-tanzania-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_married-southwest-pilots", "text": "On their first flight together, Joel Atkinson and Shelley Atkinson couldn\u2019t contain their excitement. They enthused to the flight attendants. They posed for photos. They told passengers via a pre-flight announcement. \u201cWe made a big deal about it,\u201d Joel tells CNN Travel. Then, right before take off, Joel and Shelley sat side by side in the flight deck, just the two of them. They\u2019d come full circle, and were about to embark on an exciting new chapter. \u201cIt felt amazing,\u201d Shelley tells CNN Travel. \u201cAs we prepared to take off, I was giddy, euphoric,\u201d says Joel. Joel and Shelley met as twentysomethings flying jets in the US Air Force. They became fast friends, then, over time, fell in love. Today, they\u2019ve been married for 27 years and counting. They\u2019ve brought up two kids together. And now they\u2019re both pilots for Southwest Airlines. They regularly fly together, with Joel as captain and Shelley as first officer. The couple say working together is \u201camazing.\u201d They treat layovers as \u201cdate nights.\u201d They learn from one another\u2019s respective \u201cwisdom and judgment.\u201d And no, they don\u2019t argue mid-flight. \u201cPeople ask us, how does it work, flying together?\u201d says Joel. \u201cWe know a few pilot couples and some of them fly together, some of them don\u2019t. I\u2019ve heard people say, \u2018Oh I could never fly with my wife or my husband.\u2019\u201d For Joel and Shelley, working together is seamless \u2013 a joy that comes easily to them both. \u201cWe\u2019re best friends,\u201d says Shelley. \u201cThere\u2019s just that unspoken bond,\u201d says Joel. Inspired by \u2018Top Gun\u2019 Shelley grew up in Iowa and moved to Colorado \u2013 Joel\u2019s home state \u2013 as a teenager. The two spent their high school years unaware of one another, but they graduated the same year, and both opted to study at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado in the late 1980s. Joel says he was very influenced by the 1985 Tom Cruise movie \u201cTop Gun\u201d \u2013 \u201cwhich made flying jets look like a lot of fun.\u201d For Shelley, who was an athlete, the appeal of the Air Force Academy was less about flying \u2013 which she only really discovered once she was enrolled \u2013 and more an opportunity to play college basketball. \u201cI didn\u2019t attend the Academy to pursue flying, initially. Once I was there I realized it was a great opportunity for a fun and challenging career,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the introduction to flying there made me want to pursue it further.\u201d Joel and Shelley spent four years studying at the Air Force Academy without actually crossing paths, although Joel was vaguely aware of Shelley. \u201cThere\u2019s not that many women at the Air Force Academy, so I kind of knew who she was,\u201d he says. The two finally met a few years later, after they\u2019d both completed pilot training in different states. They got the same first assignment \u2013 flying Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft in Texas. When Shelley arrived in Texas, Joel had been there for a few months. \u201cSo I was there, kind of established, and she came into the office where I was working,\u201d he recalls. \u201cShe came in and turned in the paperwork, and we said, \u2018Hi,\u2019 just exchanged some pleasantries.\u201d Joel was struck by Shelley right away. \u201cShe\u2019s tall. She looks great. She left the room and this other coworker was just looking at me smiling. And I said, \u2018What?\u2019 And he could tell.\u201d Looking back, Joel thinks it was the \u201ceye contact\u201d he had with Shelley that gave his feelings away. Or maybe just \u201cthe look on my face.\u201d \u201cThere was something there,\u201d says Joel, smiling. \u201cBut I just kind of laughed it off. I was like, \u2018Nah, we\u2019re just going to be friends.\u2019\u201d Joel was also a bit intimidated by Shelley \u2013 he was \u201cattracted to her right away,\u201d but didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d ever be interested in him. \u201cShe\u2019s taller than me. And I had never dated anyone taller than me,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s an athlete, she\u2019s a natural leader, and just an impressive person.\u201d But Joel\u2019s warm nature appealed to Shelley. She felt comfortable around him right away. They became close friends. \u201cJoel has a really great sense of humor,\u201d says Shelley. \u201cI love that about him. And he just really has a sensitive heart to people, all people around him, he looks out for people.\u201d \u201cThat really attracted me to him. And also, he used to have a nice dark head of hair. I really liked that too. But he has a very distinguished look now, and he\u2019s just as handsome as ever.\u201d About a year after they first met, Joel and Shelley were deployed abroad, together. That\u2019s when they \u201ckind of started dating,\u201d as Joel puts it. While there wasn\u2019t much opportunity to go on actual dates on active service, they bonded. \u201cConversations, talking about everything, basically,\u201d says Shelley. \u201cWe really got to know each other\u2019s heart that way. And I think it just made it clear that this is what we were supposed to do.\u201d Back home in the US, the two \u201cstarted officially dating.\u201d \u201cWe just kind of knew that this was going to be it,\u201d says Joel. \u201cAnd within a few months, we got married.\u201d Joel and Shelley became instructor Air Force pilots in Mississippi. Then, in the early 2000s, Shelley gave birth to the couple\u2019s kids, two twins, a boy and a girl. Shelley left flying around this time, but she stayed in the military, working for the US Air National Guard. \u201cI wanted to be at home,\u201d says Shelley. The path to pregnancy wasn\u2019t easy for the couple and Joel calls their kids a \u201chuge blessing.\u201d \u201cWe went through in vitro a couple of times,\u201d he says. \u201cIt took a few years for us to actually get pregnant.\u201d The family relocated back to Colorado and Joel transitioned from military flying to commercial flying, becoming a pilot with Southwest Airlines in 2006. Returning to the air Cut to 2021. The pandemic years were tough going for Joel and Shelley, emotionally speaking. While the couple stayed healthy, their kids were in their late teens and struggled with the upheaval. Plus, Covid was impacting the aviation industry, so Joel was flying less. Around this time, Shelley left her job at the National Guard. She and Joel were wholly focused on their family and their kids\u2019 wellbeing. But in time, the pandemic waned and Joel started flying more regularly. Joel and Shelley\u2019s kids graduated high school and started the next phase of their lives. It was a transitional period for the Atkinson family, and in turn, Shelley started considering her future. She found herself dreaming about flying. She hadn\u2019t been behind the controls of a plane in over two decades, but she felt a call to return. She started wondering if, like Joel, she could become a commercial pilot. When Shelley voiced the idea to Joel, he was immediately enthusiastic. \u201cI said, \u2018Come fly with me,\u2019\u201d says Joel, joking \u201ccue the music.\u201d Then, by coincidence, later that day, Joel saw a social media post from his airline, Southwest, about a pilot who\u2019d taken a two decade break to raise a family, then returned to flying. \u201cShe literally had the same story as me,\u201d says Shelley. It felt like a sign. While Joel didn\u2019t know this other pilot directly, he was able to reach out to her via his work network and pass on contact details to Shelley, who subsequently texted the other pilot, asking for guidance and advice. Then, with encouragement from her new friend \u2013 plus Joel\u2019s wholehearted support \u2013 Shelley committed to returning to the skies full time. While Shelley had years of Air Force experience, she hadn\u2019t flown airplanes for 20 years. She had had to hit the books, take additional tests and ensure her qualifications were up to speed. But before long Shelley was hired by SkyWest Airlines, flying regional jets. Then she joined Joel at Southwest in 2023. \u201cIt was crazy. It happened way faster than I thought it would. It\u2019s been amazing,\u201d says Shelley. \u201cIt was meant to be,\u201d says Joel. Flying together Joel and Shelley credit their success as a co-pilot team to their nearly three decades of marriage, as well as years of co-parenting. \u201cRaising two teenagers during Covid, I tell people that was a lot harder than what we\u2019re doing now,\u201d says Joel. Plus, the two met as colleagues \u2013 so they know how to balance commitment to a job with enjoying each other\u2019s company. Still, as a married couple in the military, Joel and Shelley never flew in the same aircraft. \u201cThe military kind of frowns upon it,\u201d says Joel. \u201cIt\u2019s a little morbid, but they don\u2019t want you to both go down in a plane crash.\u201d No such guidelines exist in commercial aviation, and so once Shelley joined Southwest, she and Joel were able to work side by side. Joel\u2019s seniority allows him to regularly bid for flights with Shelley. And the two find Joel\u2019s years of commercial aviation experience pairs well with Shelley\u2019s fresh take. \u201cShe looks to me and relies on me for the experience that I have. But I also know that she is a very sharp person, she just went through a lot of training. So her knowledge is fresh. And she also has that wisdom and judgment,\u201d says Joel. Since the excitement of their first flight, Joel and Shelley tend not to \u201cmake a big deal\u201d about being a husband and wife pilot duo \u2013 unless it\u2019s preempted by their colleagues. \u201cWe wait for them to ask,\u201d says Shelley. As the couple share the same last name, often crew members put two and two together. As Joel\u2019s the more senior of the two, he often runs the pre-flight briefing. Sometimes he\u2019ll end it with a quick, throwaway: \u201cYes, we\u2019re married.\u201d The crew usually \u201cstart laughing,\u201d says Joel. When Joel and Shelley are taking off and landing, they\u2019re focused on the job at hand. \u201cIt\u2019s very technical,\u201d says Joel. \u201cWe\u2019re running checklists.\u201d But when the airplane reaches cruising altitude, \u201cthere\u2019s some downtime\u201d and Joel and Shelley will make the most of it, talking through their thoughts on life, their kids, their future plans and everything else that\u2019s on their mind. \u201cIt\u2019s so great, because all the years that I was flying, and she was at home, anything I wanted to talk to her about when I\u2019m up in the air, it had to wait,\u201d says Joel. \u201cYou\u2019re saving up conversations until you\u2019re home. It\u2019s like now we\u2019re making up for lost time.\u201d Then, when they land, Joel and Shelley make the most of the layovers. Southwest largely flies domestically, so the couple enjoy traveling the length and breadth of the US together. \u201cIt is a great job, because you go see different places and spend time in different cities,\u201d says Joel, but before Shelley joined Southwest, Joel says layovers sometimes felt like \u201cwasted time, because it was just me, and I couldn\u2019t share it with her.\u201d \u201cBut now we\u2019re together when we\u2019re on the road \u2013 it\u2019s so fun. Because every night on the road, it\u2019s a date night together,\u201d he says. Now, instead of counting the days until he\u2019s home, Joel says his \u201chome is right here\u201d because \u201cshe\u2019s with me.\u201d Family connection While Joel and Shelley have flown together countless times since Shelley joined Southwest, they\u2019ve yet to fly with their kids in tow. That\u2019s on the to-do list \u2013 plus, their son is also training to be a pilot, so there\u2019s a chance Shelley and Joel might pilot an aircraft with him in the future. For Shelley, an additional perk of the last couple of years is her adult kids getting to \u201cview her as a pilot for the first time.\u201d Shelley and Joel\u2019s children grew up knowing their parents met flying jets \u2013 but\u00a0while they saw their father regularly piloting airplanes for Southwest, they never saw Shelley flying. Shelley is really happy her children get to see her doing a job she loves. Shelley\u2019s also proud to be a female pilot in an industry that\u2019s still very male-dominated. She hopes to inspire other people, especially mothers who may have taken a break from the workplace to raise a family, by demonstrating that returning to a passion is possible. \u201cI hope it encourages other women that there is this opportunity out there \u2013 you can come back and you can still do it,\u201d she says. Shelley says she\u2019s really loved rediscovering her love of flying. \u201cThe view from 36,000 feet is pretty awesome,\u201d she says. \u201cFlying over parts of the country - I just love looking down and going, \u2018Oh, what town is that?\u2019\u201d Shelley and Joel particularly enjoy flying in and out of San Diego, California, but they also love it when Southwest takes them to New York. Before Christmas, they enjoyed a stopover in New York City and went searching for the settings of their favorite movies, from \u201cElf\u201d to \u201cSerendipity.\u201d \u201cI love traveling, seeing new places,\u201d says Joel, who adds that he\u2019s gone from avoiding working weekends to voluntarily signing up for Saturday and Sunday flight shifts. He and Shelley now spend Saturday nights watching jazz in Portland, going on hikes in Sacramento or drinking cocktails in Palm Springs. Joel\u2019s always loved flying \u2013 especially what he calls \u201cthe art and science\u201d of aviation. He also loves \u201cserving people, getting them to where they need to be,\u201d but he admits flying during the pandemic was hard going. For Joel, having Shelley now by his side at work has \u201cbeen just a complete turnaround.\u201d Now even the ride to work is fun as the couple car share, coffees in hand. Joel and Shelley, who post about their adventures on their Instagram account @luvpilots, are currently planning to pick up a flight together on Valentine\u2019s Day. Joel bought the two of them heart-printed ties especially \u2013 they\u2019re \u201csilly, but fun,\u201d says Joel. The couple enjoy chronicling their travels on social media \u2013 celebrating their marriage, their respective careers and their adventures. \u201cWe feel blessed. We\u2019re thankful for the opportunity,\u201d says Joel. \u201cWe\u2019re thankful to Southwest Airlines for letting us do this together.\u201d \u201cIf you love doing something, why not do it with the person you love?\u201d says Shelley.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/married-southwest-pilots/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_stunning-secret-italian-lakes", "text": "Tourists regularly flock to Italy to enjoy its beaches and islands, they admire its historical cities \u2013 and of course they enjoy the food. Recently, they\u2019ve been coming in far greater numbers, leaving some destinations overwhelmed. However, there are still places to visit that offer an escape from the crowds as well as stunning scenery. We\u2019re talking lakes. But not Lake Garda, the huge body of water that nestles up against the Alps, busy with resort towns. And not celebrity-favorite Lake Como. Italy has dozens of secret smaller lakes that boast superb scenery, unknown to mass tourism, where locals get together on day trips and enjoy picnics. These are some of the best: Lake Turano One of the best-kept secrets of Lazio, the region around Rome, is Lake Turano. Visitors to Rome, many who wilt during the heat of the Eternal City\u2019s fiery summers, have no idea that nearby lies an enchanted place that has the views, the history, the food and a welcome breath of fresh air. It wasn\u2019t meant to be a vacation spot at first. When Benito Mussolini, Italy\u2019s former dictator, ordered the construction of this artificial lake in the 1930s to supply water to nearby power plants, the last thing he expected was for it to turn into a weekend detox retreat for people longing for open spaces. Lago del Turano has an ideal location, close to the capital but far from the noise and chaos. Set in the wild countryside north of Rome and surrounded by hills, the location was once home to the Fallisci, an ancient tribe, before they were wiped out by ancient Romans. Free-roaming cows and sheep greet visitors along a road cut through a deep forest that leads to the lake. Once out of the woods, the mesmerizing scenery of the lake forces drivers to stop at a belvedere with benches to take in the view. The lake brims with giant carp that draw anglers from across Italy for fishing contests. Two picturesque towns of stone dwellings with panoramic balconies overlook lake Turano - the clifftop medieval Castel di Tora and the even more ancient Colle di Tora, sit right on the shoreline. There\u2019s also a tall peninsula jutting out into the lake topped with an old monastery. The water is crystal-clear and the pebble shores are dotted with beach facilities where one can rent dinghies, canoes, boats, or simply suntan and sunbathe in tropical-like waters. Just one metal bridge runs over the water connecting Castel di Tora to the main road. In winter, most holiday homes are shut and the narrow alleys are largely deserted apart from cats. In spring, locals spruce up their outdoor patios and socialize in the little piazza. Fresh fish is served at restaurant L\u2019Angoletto, a stone cottage with an open panoramic veranda over the lake. Hotel Turano has cozy, no-frills lakefront rooms and a restaurant serving local specialties. Lake Scanno The most intriguing of all lakes however is Lake Scanno, the \u201cpearl\u201d of eastern Italy\u2019s Abruzzo region, which is as beautiful as it is mysterious. Over the years, tales and myths have been spun about this deep green, heart-shaped lake that persist today, attracting scientists and paranormal investigators who try to find explanations to weird happenings that have long baffled locals. Surrounded by the Apennines mountain range, it is said this natural lake, named after the overhanging village above, has magical powers. Locals believe the lake is alive and some have previously reported unusual phenomena such as shattering light bulbs, exploding TV screens and ceiling lamps dancing as if a small earthquake had just struck. They also tell stories of other unexplained events: sudden water level drops, divers compasses going berserk and dead fish and even long-lost World War II weapons floating on the surface. There\u2019s said to be a mysterious unidentified object buried in the lake bed. Lake Scanno\u2019s unusual atmosphere is almost palpable. In the heady days of summer, the sense of mystery hangs in the warm air. Despite its green color, caused by harmless algae in the water, bathing is permitted here as is windsurfing. The lake is also ripe for exploration, with a \u201cPath of the Heart\u201d trail that circles its banks and takes in a church, said to be a site of miracles, and an old hermitage. Along the shores there is a beach kitted out for summer bathing. There are mountain bike trails and it\u2019s possible to rent rickshaws, rowing boats and canoes.Other facilities include a children\u2019s playground, and a parking area for campers. Lakefront Agriturismo Miralago is a farm and B&B, where horses roam free. It serves traditional dishes like tagliatelle with wild boar. The village of Scanno, a puzzle of lavish bourgeois mansions and humble shepherd dwellings decorated with bright flower pots, is a must-see. Lake Iseo Located just a few miles from Milan, this picturesque spot formed from pure Alpine glacial meltwater is also a source of great sparkling wines, made from grapes grown on its banks. The lake has three islands. The two smallest are private while the largest, Montisola, a huge mountain sticking out of the deep blue water, is heaven for nature-lovers. Here, visitors can rent canoes or fishing boats for a private tour of the lake. Another shoreside attraction is the brightly colored dwellings built for fishermen that stand on stilts over the edge of the water, among them restaurant Locanda al Lago, known for its fish dishes and the sardines hung on the dock to dry. Hotel Sensole is a lakefront Baroque palazzo that contains a gourmet bistrot. Lake Nemi This small lake just beyond the southwestern suburbs of Rome is where locals flock for Sunday lunches with traditional porchetta pork sandwiches and heady red wines. They\u2019re treading in the footsteps of their ancient predecessors. Back in the days of Roman empire, senators and wealthy families came here to relax in lavish retreats around Nemi\u2019s shores, where succulent strawberries grow amid archeological ruins and dense forests. Sited among the Colli Albani hills on the edge of Rome, the lake is of volcanic origin and sits in an extinct crater. It\u2019s accessible by foot along an old route that winds down from a village on the slopes above it that shares the lake\u2019s name. Lakefront B&B Lago di Nemi is an old restyled farmhouse that rents out bicycles, while restaurant La Fiocina on the shore, serves fish specialties like fried whitebait with green peppers. Lake Orta Orta is one of the secret gems of Italy\u2019s Piedmont region, usually overlooked by visitors who flock to the more touristy Lago Maggiore nearby. Created by a melting Alpine glacier, it\u2019s a quiet idyll with picturesque villages, chapels and medieval towers along its banks. In the middle of Orta, the monastery-island of San Giulio rises from the water. Alongside myriad biking and horseback riding trails, it\u2019s possible to waterski and even scuba dive in the translucent waters that lie off its pebble beaches. L\u2019Approdo\u00a0is a four-star lakefront hotel restaurant with a panoramic terrace and pool. Lake Trasimeno This shallow lake formed millennia ago by tectonic movements of the Earth\u2019s crust is located in a less touristy part of Umbria, where just locals have holiday homes and shops in the overhanging village of Castiglione don\u2019t sell the usual souvenirs. Trasimeno\u2019s banks are dotted with medieval hamlets and wooden bridges that cross over the water that are great for birdwatching and sunset drinks. Beaches here rent out windsurf and kite equipment. B&B Dolce Dormire has cozy rooms in the ancient district of Castiglione, while La Casa di Campagna is a rural farm and tavern serving local specialties.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/stunning-secret-italian-lakes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_deer-deadly-vehicles-collision", "text": "Retired public relations professional Bonnie Sashin and her husband had just spent a nice Thanksgiving visit and meal with family at her stepson\u2019s suburban home in the Connecticut city of Fairfield, a charming burg of about 61,000 on Long Island Sound. By the time they departed the 2022 family gathering, the sun had already set, Sashin recalls. They cranked up her fairly new Subaru Forester SUV to head to a nearby hotel, where they were staying the night rather than make the two-and-a-half hour drive back to Brookline, Massachusetts, on full stomachs and in full darkness. \u201cAnd just as we turned the corner, practically out of the subdivision where my stepson lives \u2026\u00a0I can feel something hit the car. You know, it\u2019s dark, and I had no idea what could it be. And I was just very alarmed,\u201d Sashin said. \u201cMy husband thought it was some kind of animal, and we of course stopped and fortunately a nice, civic-minded woman in front of us stopped. \u2026 She got out of the car. She saw me. She was really nice. She said, \u2018Oh, that was a deer.\u2019 And she said, \u2018It happens all the time around here.\u2019\u201c The deadly deer problem It turns out that deer-vehicle collisions are far more than a southern Connecticut problem. They\u2019re a problem across much of the United States and in other nations. It also turns out Sashin was fortunate not to have been injured or even killed in the incident. Even people who realize how common deer-vehicle collisions are might be surprised at these startling stats for the United States from this November 2022 study in the journal Cell Biology: \u2022 Around 2.1 million deer-vehicle collisions occur annually. \u2022 The collisions cause more than $10 billion in economic losses annually. \u2022 Each year, they account for some 59,000 human injuries and 440 human deaths. Kip Adams, chief conservation officer with the National Deer Association, notes that deer are much more deadly to Americans each year than those scary movie and TV threats \u2013 sharks, alligators, bears and venomous snakes \u2013 combined. (For instance, there were just two deaths in the United States by shark attack in 2023.) Looks like we should be much more wary of Bambi than of Jaws. And the United States is not alone in having a deer problem. For instance, a 2023 study from Scotland\u2019s nature agency, NatureScot, estimated that 700 people are injured or killed in deer-vehicle collisions in the United Kingdom annually. They grapple with the deer problem in such far-flung places as British Columbia, Japan, Australia and Germany, too. So what can drivers do to protect themselves from unwanted encounters with these herbivores? When time is not on your side Adams says your best shield against a deer collision isn\u2019t a fancy gadget but knowledge. \u201cThe first step in helping to minimize hitting one is to be aware of when they are most active,\u201d he told CNN Travel in a phone interview. \u201cTwo things that play into that. \u2026 One is when they\u2019re most active daily and then also when they are most active annually.\u201d As for the daily factor, sunrise and sunset should be high-alert times for drivers, Adams said. Why is that? \u201cDeer are what\u2019s known as crepuscular \u2013 crepuscular means most active at dawn and dusk,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThe way their eyes are built, they can do the best job avoiding predators and collecting what they need when they move in low-light situations \u2013 that being dusk and that being dawn.\u201d But \u201cthat\u2019s not our peak vision time. So those two things together \u2013 more activity at a time when we can\u2019t see as good \u2013 really play into increased deer-vehicle collisions at those times,\u201d Adams said. Chad Stewart, a deer, elk and moose management specialist with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, concurs. \u201cI would say the hour on either side of both sunrise and sunset are the greatest times when a collision can occur,\u201d he said in an email interview with CNN Travel. \u201cThis is partly due to deer\u2019s activity around that time, but also because of heavy traffic patterns during those hours.\u201d But collisions can occur anytime around the clock, Adams cautions. Keep seasons in mind Collisions can also happen any time of year \u2013 after all, deer don\u2019t hibernate, Adams points out. But two times of year are typically more high risk. Adams said the first one is spring. That\u2019s fawning time, and \u201cdeer are way more active around roads,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen a doe is having her fawn, the does become extremely territorial of those areas. \u2026 What happens is deer get spread out a lot more on the landscape, which means that they\u2019re more apt to, you know, be near a road.\u201d But autumn is the season most fraught with danger, Adams said, \u201cand the majority of that occurs in November. During that time, deer greatly increase their daily movement patterns,\u201d he said, especially the bucks. Research from State Farm insurance company also highlights November as the most likely month of the year to have a collision with an animal. Where to be on high alert As Bonnie Sashin\u2019s collision in a Connecticut suburb illustrates, you don\u2019t have to be out in wilderness to collide with a deer. \u201cTypically, suburban areas can hold higher densities of deer, and with more miles driven by vehicles occurring in these areas compared to rural areas, total number of collisions tends to be highest in these areas,\u201d Stewart cautioned. \u201cBut with that being said, any place has the potential for a collision.\u00a0 Especially where habitat transitions occur (e.g. forest to field), which are commonly used locations for deer.\u201d Adams said be on extra guard where the woods come out close to the road, where \u201cwe have very little opportunity of seeing those deer prior to them being in front of a vehicle.\u201d The suburbs are also a big problem, he said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s extremely difficult to manage deer populations in those areas. We can\u2019t go in there in most cases and hunt like we do in more rural areas.\u201d States with the biggest deer problems Some US states have a bigger problem with deer-vehicle collisions than others. State Farm compiles annual statistics assessing the risk in each state. While the insurance company\u2019s statistics cover all animal-vehicle collisions, deer account for the majority of them. Seventeen states are considered \u201chigh risk\u201d for an animal-vehicle collision, according to the latest State Farm report for 2023-24. Topping the list is West Virginia, where drivers have a 1 in 38 annual risk of being in an animal-involved claim, State Farm says. That\u2019s not surprising to Adams. The Mountain State is filled with forests, has a high deer population and lacks much in the way of dense urban areas. \u201cThey have a lot of winding roads through wooded areas which further reduces the visibility. A lot of factors play together there that definitely put West Virginia at the top,\u201d Adams said. Rounding out the top 5 states are: No. 2: Montana (1 in 53 chance)No. 3: Pennsylvania (1 in 59 chance)No. 4: Michigan (1 in 60 chance)No. 5: Wisconsin (1 in 60 chance) Your best bets to avoid colliding with an animal: Nevada, where State Farm says the chance is just 1 in 770, and Hawaii (1 in 710 chance). Defensive driving Once you\u2019re better aware of when and where the collision risk is highest, then it\u2019s time to put driving strategies into place. \u201cBasic safe driving principles apply to reduce your chance at a collision.\u00a0 First and foremost, avoid distracted driving,\u201d Stewart said.\u00a0Also, slow down in areas known to have high deer numbers so you can \u201chave better reaction should one jump out in front of your vehicle.\u201d Adams said use your high beams whenever possible in deer territory \u2013 but don\u2019t blind oncoming traffic. Stewart\u2019s not sold on gadget remedies. \u201cUsing things like car mounted whistles are not proven to reduce or prevent collisions from occurring, so saving your money and not falling into a false sense of security with these items is advisable.\u201d However, do make good use of your car horn, advises the National Deer Association in this YouTube video. Some other tips from the Michigan State Police: \u2022 Deer typically follow one another in single file, so if you see one deer, there are likely more nearby.\u2022 Look for the reflection of headlights in a deer\u2019s eyes and deer silhouettes on the shoulder of the road.\u2022 Scan the roadside while driving, especially around wooded lots, fencerows, field edges and areas near water. Do. Not. Swerve. Unfortunately, some drivers despite all their caution are going to have to make a split-second decision \u2013 and fight a natural impulse \u2013 when there\u2019s a deer ahead in the road. \u201cWe have a campaign in Michigan called \u2018Don\u2019t veer for deer.\u2019 The reason this phrase is used is because while nobody wants to hit a deer, there can be far worse consequences by swerving to avoid a deer and hitting something else, like a telephone pole or another car,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cSometimes, collisions with deer simply can\u2019t be avoided. But the important thing is to not make it worse for you or somebody else by abruptly and erratically leaving your lane.\u201d Adams dispenses the same advice with a fatherly touch. \u201cI have a 17-year-old daughter. I talk to her about this all the time. Try to avoid the deer but do not swerve because your chances of having a bad accident are much higher,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s way better to hit a deer with the front of your car going straight where that car is built to withstand an impact than it is to swerve and go off the road\u201d and possibly hit a tree or another vehicle, Adams said. The problem with pets and feeding Collisions account for the vast majority of interactions that result in injuries or deaths to people, Adams said, but they aren\u2019t the only ways people can be hurt by these generally docile grazers. Though incidents are very rare, he said deer that have been raised in captivity and have lost their fear of humans can end up hurting the hands that fed them. \u201cYou can find accounts where \u2026 somebody got attacked by a deer, like literally attacked. In almost every case, that was a captive animal that had been hand reared.\u201d Several years ago, a Colorado woman was cited for illegally raising a young deer that attacked and gored one of her neighbors, according to state wildlife officials. In 2023, a Florida man\u2019s pet deer was euthanized on the scene by officials after the animal attacked one of his neighbors. Also in 2023, a man on vacation in Greece approached too closely to a deer for a selfie. The deer rammed him and broke some of his ribs. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission warns people not to feed deer and to treat them with the respect wild creatures deserve. Hunting accidents Hunting is the other time where human-deer interactions can go wrong. In 2019, an experienced Arkansas hunter was found severely injured in the woods, his body riddled with antler puncture wounds from a deer he had shot but had not killed. He later died. Experts say hunters should wait 15 to 30 minutes before approaching a shot deer to make sure it is dead. However, the biggest danger in deer hunting is other people, Adams said. \u201cHunting is very safe, and it has gotten way safer over the past couple of decades with hunter safety programs, but accidents still do happen. And it\u2019s very clear that the most dangerous person in the woods to you, if you\u2019re hunting, is the person you walked in the woods with.\u201d Again, awareness is key, Adams said. \u201cI have a family camp in northern Pennsylvania. We have a lot of friends and family that hunt that we share our land with. \u2026 If we are going out as a group to hunt deer, bear, whatever \u2026 I have a little safety talk and tell everybody, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s be careful today.\u2019 \u201c \u2018I came away lucky\u2019 Bonnie Sashin\u2019s Thanksgiving night collision with a deer happened in a flash. But the repercussions took a while to sort out. The Good Samaritan who stopped in front of her was quite helpful, she said. \u201cFirst thing she said to me \u2013 which was the best piece of advice for us because no one was hurt \u2013 was call the police \u2026 because you\u2019re gonna want a record for your insurance company.\u201d Sashin said she later learned about a friend who collided with a deer and didn\u2019t call the police right away \u2013\u00a0and the adjuster gave her a hard time. The front fender of Sashin\u2019s new car was bashed in, but she and her husband were able to drive her SUV back to Massachusetts, where they learned the vehicle could be repaired vs. being totaled. \u201cI went in to my body shop where I know the guy, his name is Paul. \u2026 He said, \u2018Bonnie, get in line. You know how many cars I have that have been hit by deer in the last week?\u2019 \u201d There were five or six ahead of hers, he told her. \u201cThe pain in the butt part is that you gotta wait a long time these days with a body shop. \u2026 It\u2019s very hard to get parts.\u201d She had to wait until February to get her SUV repaired. Sashin and her husband continue to drive to family trips in the Northeast, but they try to be off the road before dark these days. Despite everything, she\u2019s grateful they weren\u2019t hurt or the vehicle totaled. \u201cI came away lucky.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/deer-deadly-vehicles-collision/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_plaza-hotel-couple-chance-encounters", "text": "In 1969, Stefano Ripamonti was feeling good about life. He was in his late twenties, working a glamorous job at an Italian high fashion shoe firm. He\u2019d recently married his childhood sweetheart and the newlyweds were settling into an apartment near the Vatican city walls in Rome, Italy. While their new home had great potential, the couple wanted to renovate the space to their tastes, so they employed an interior architect-slash-designer. This architect subsequently spent a lot of time at the apartment with Stefano\u2019s wife \u2013 reconfiguring spaces, suggesting paint colors and offering interior design insights. Meanwhile, Stefano was regularly away on business trips. One day, Stefano returned from a trip to Accra, Ghana, to find his wife standing in the half-decorated apartment, in tears. \u201cApparently during my absence, she and the architect had fallen in love,\u201d Stefano tells CNN Travel today. \u201cAnd just like that, she was out of my life, leaving me devastated.\u201d A trip to New York City Heartbroken, Stefano buried himself in work, and he was subsequently offered a new job with a different Italian shoe company. Not only did the new role pay \u201calmost double,\u201d the job also offered Stefano the chance to visit the US for the first time, to attend a shoe convention in New York City. Stefano had been fascinated with the States since the day American tanks rolled into Rome to liberate the city from the Nazis. Young Stefano and his parents had joined the crowds lining the streets cheering, and then an American soldier jumped down from one of the Sherman tanks to present two-year-old Stefano with a small tin box containing chocolate. Printed on the front of the tin were the words: \u201cMade by Curtiss Candy Co. Chicago.\u201d In the years that followed, Stefano treasured this candy box and daydreamed about Chicago \u2013 home of delicious candy that not only tasted good, but represented freedom. \u201cTo this day, I still have that box,\u201d says Stefano. All of this meant that, for Stefano, nothing could dampen the excitement of his first trip to the US \u2013 not even a lingering heartbreak over a broken marriage. The day after his arrival in the US in February 1970, Stefano dressed in his best suit and strolled into the lobby of New York City\u2019s Plaza Hotel. He hoped to potentially meet some department store buyers, and to soak up the atmosphere of an American institution. Stefano recalls making himself comfortable \u201con a long upholstered bench\u201d in the marble hotel lobby. As he sat there \u2013 people-watching and admiring the grandeur of the space \u2013 Stefano became gradually aware of the young woman sitting next to him, who was reading a copy of the New York Times. When Stefano glanced her way, one word came to mind: \u201cradiant.\u201d He wanted to say something, to introduce himself, but he couldn\u2019t think of anything to say that didn\u2019t seem \u201cinane.\u201d Stefano didn\u2019t want to bother her \u2013 and he was supposed to be networking. Eventually, figuring the elevators were probably a better place to spot potential buyers, Stefano decided to leave the lobby. He was just getting up when the woman lowered her newspaper and smiled at him. \u201cExcuse me, do you have the time?\u201d she asked. Taken aback, Stefano glanced at his watch and realized he still hadn\u2019t adjusted it to Eastern Standard Time. \u201cLet\u2019s see, I have Italian time on my watch,\u201d said Stefano. \u201cOh, are you from Italy?\u201d asked the woman. \u201cI was just there this past summer with my sister.\u201d She folded her newspaper to one side. Then, she held out her hand for Stefano to shake, still smiling. \u201cI\u2019m Sally,\u201d she said. \u201cSally Wilton.\u201d Sally Wilton was a 22-year-old recent college graduate working in Washington D.C. That weekend in February 1970, she\u2019d decided to visit New York City on a spontaneous trip away. \u201cI just decided to go to New York on my own \u2013 I wanted to see a play,\u201d Sally tells CNN Travel. Unbeknownst to Stefano, Sally had noticed Stefano as soon as he sat down on the bench in the lobby. In fact, the whole time he\u2019d been searching for an opportunity to introduce himself, she\u2019d been doing the same. \u201cHe was dressed impeccably, with a velveteen jacket. I remember it was kind of a dark gold color,\u201d recalls Sally. \u201cIt looked so Italian and so well tailored. I was used to American boys that wore sweatshirts and jeans.\u201d During her college years, Sally had spent a year studying abroad in Leeds, England. This experience had opened her mind to travel and she loved meeting people from different countries and cultures. Sally told Stefano this over a coffee in the Palm Court, the grand tearoom in the Plaza Hotel. And she mentioned, in passing, that she was born and raised in Chicago. Stefano couldn\u2019t believe his ears. The city had taken on almost mythical proportions in his mind. To be sitting opposite a woman from Chicago was surreal. Then, Sally casually mentioned her father worked in the candy business. While Sally\u2019s father didn\u2019t work for Curtiss Candy \u2013 that might have been too bizarre \u2013 to Stefano, this connection still felt like a huge coincidence. It felt like fate. Coffee turned into lunch, which turned into Sally and Stefano spending the afternoon exploring New York together. They realized they shared a love of art, dipping into the Guggenheim and then the Museum of Modern Art. The whole time, they couldn\u2019t stop stealing glances at one another. \u201cSally looked so radiant and American, with this big beautiful smile,\u201d recalls Stefano. \u201cShe was beautiful, very attractive. But she was also extremely friendly, sparkling, bubbly.\u201d \u201cStefano was this very good-looking, kind of erudite guy,\u201d says Sally. \u201cIt was enchanting for me.\u201d After just that one afternoon, Stefano felt like \u201cthey kind of fit together right away.\u201d \u201cEven if our cultures were so different, the two cultures clashed together in a positive way,\u201d he says. Stefano was still married, albeit separated. And Sally had a boyfriend back in Washington D.C. But despite these other ties, that whole afternoon, there was something between them that was \u201cdifficult to identify,\u201d as Stefano recalls it, but felt special. Reluctantly, Sally and Stefano said their goodbyes at the end of the day. \u201cI had to go back to my job, and he was supposed to leave New York,\u201d recalls Sally. \u201cBut he said, \u2018If you could come back next week, I\u2019ll manage to stay the whole week and wait for you.\u2019 So I did. I went back. I worked all week. Then I flew back the next weekend.\u201d \u2018The best weekend of our life\u2019 The next weekend was a whirlwind. Sally and Stefano hired a helicopter to fly them across the city. They went dancing at the glittering Rainbow Room, on the 65th floor of 30 Rockefeller Plaza at the Rockefeller Center. They drank cocktails at the Russian Tea Room. They marveled at the fact they\u2019d crossed into each other\u2019s lives. \u201cIt was the best weekend of our life,\u201d says Stefano. \u201cWe were in love.\u201d On Sunday night, Stefano had to return to Italy, and Sally had to go back to Washington D.C. But this distance \u2013 really any other complications \u2013 felt immaterial. \u201cIt was a big spark that we felt, so everything changed,\u201d says Sally. Sitting in Trader Vic\u2019s, a since-closed Tiki Bar at the Plaza Hotel, on their last night together, Stefano wrote a promise for Sally on the back of a beer mat: \u201cSe sono rose, fioriranno,\u201d an Italian phrase meaning \u201cif they are roses, they will bloom.\u201d To Stefano, the words resonated \u2013 if he and Sally were meant to be together, they would be. Underneath he scribbled the location, \u201cNew York,\u201d and the date: February 6, 1970. When they said their goodbyes, Sally vowed to come to Rome as soon as she could. A week later, on Valentine\u2019s Day, a telegram arrived for Stefano: \u201cMy sweet friend stop I send you a Valentine kiss stop Arrive Roma in one or two weeks at most stop Details will follow soon.\u201d Moving across the world The morning Sally arrived in Rome happened to be the day Stefano was in court finalizing his separation from his wife. There was no divorce in Italy back then \u2013 it only came into practice later in 1970 \u2013 but this day signaled the end of Stefano\u2019s broken relationship, and the start of a new chapter. After the court hearing, Sally and Stefano reunited outside Stefano\u2019s apartment. They embraced in the middle of the street, Stefano lifting Sally up in the air and the two of them twirling together. \u201cWe were so excited,\u201d recalls Stefano. \u201cWe hugged and kissed for a while in the middle of the street.\u201d Then Stefano showed Sally his Rome apartment for the first time. \u201cThe decorator that the wife had fallen in love with did a beautiful job,\u201d says Sally. \u201cThe apartment was gorgeous.\u201d The apartment was situated above a little bar, and Stefano and Sally came to an arrangement with the owner. \u201cEvery morning, they\u2019d bring a tray upstairs to our bedroom with cappuccino, fresh fruit, orange juices,\u201d says Stefano. \u201cHe\u2019d\u00a0 put it right on the bed, every morning,\u201d recalls Sally. \u201cIt was very romantic.\u201d For Sally, this wasn\u2019t a quick trip to Rome. She planned to stay indefinitely. She\u2019d quit her job in Washington D.C. and called her parents to tell them she\u2019d met the love of her life. \u201cUnfortunately, the circumstances of our meeting sounded markedly less romantic when received over the phone from your daughter in Italy,\u201d says Stefano. Sally\u2019s parents were concerned that Stefano was still married \u2013 and alarmed that Sally had packed up her life and moved to Rome on the basis of two brief encounters. They decided to fly from Chicago \u2013 not just her parents, but her sisters as well \u2013 to check in on Sally and suss out Stefano. Stefano understood this visit had big stakes at play. He decided, as he puts it today, that he \u201cneeded to do something very impressive for these folks to demolish any suspicions about my character integrity.\u201d Stefano\u2019s father worked for the Rome Metropolitan police, heading up the motorized vehicles unit. Stefano started wondering if his father could organize a personal police escort for Sally\u2019s family upon their arrival at Rome Fiumicino Airport. \u201cMy father, unsurprisingly, answered with a resounding no,\u201d says Stefano. \u201cBut it happened that I personally knew a half-dozen motorcycle cops, having grown up with them since I was 12 years old. I talked to the two closest to me and I explained the situation.\u201d The two policemen agreed to Stefano\u2019s plan \u2013 sort of. \u201cThey said they would quote-on-quote \u2018happen\u2019 to be on location and they would do it,\u201d recalls Stefano. \u201cNobody would ever know.\u201d So upon landing in Italy, Sally\u2019s family zoomed through the Roman traffic, through red lights and busy streets, in a hired limousine, flanked by two policemen on motorcycles. Stefano\u2019s plan worked \u2013 Sally\u2019s father was impressed. \u201cWhen we got to the hotel he jumped out of the limo and he hugged me saying it was the most exhilarating experience he could remember,\u201d says Stefano. This moment \u2013 teamed with the obvious fact of Sally\u2019s happiness \u2013 was enough to quell her family\u2019s worries. \u201cAnd then of course they met Stefano\u2019s parents, who were wonderful, and his brother and sister,\u201d says Sally. \u201cIt was a great weekend and they all went home happy.\u201d A life in Rome With Sally\u2019s family back in the US, Sally and Stefano started making a life for themselves in Rome. Sally adjusted to the late-night Italian dinner parties and tried to pick up the language \u2013 Sally wanted to learn Italian as quickly as possible. It frustrated her when she couldn\u2019t fully participate in conversations with Stefano\u2019s friends. \u201cThe Vietnam War was still going on, I had very strong opinions about it,\u201d recalls Sally. \u201cWe\u2019d all start talking, but I didn\u2019t have the words because my Italian was still very broken.\u201d Meanwhile, Sally and Stefano dined at Rome\u2019s best restaurants most evenings, interspersed with dinners at Stefano\u2019s parents\u2019 house. Neither Sally nor Stefano knew how to cook back them. One of their favorite restaurants was on the Piazza del Popolo and was also frequented by actor Marcello Mastroianni. \u201cHe\u2019d be sitting there with sunglasses on and it was very thrilling,\u201d recalls Sally. \u201cHe was my favorite Italian actor.\u201d Sally quickly fell in love with life in Rome. \u201cWe walked all over the Roman ruins. We went walking around the Colosseum, and Stefano was the best tour guide,\u201d says Sally. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have any responsibilities really \u2013 although he had his work.\u201d By then, Stefano had moved away from the fashion world and was entering the movie business. He\u2019d started a company with an old friend, with the goal of helping distribute and promote American movies in the Italian market. \u201cWe put together a little company in a beautiful office, and we signed up as clients 20th Century Fox, United Artists and Walt Disney,\u201d says Stefano. \u201cSo we launched all their movies.\u201d Stefano and his business partner organized press conferences and ferried American actors across Italy. Stefano and Sally\u2019s life soon involved hobnobbing with celebrities on the regular \u2013 at cocktail parties, premiers, showing actors around Rome. \u201cIt was exciting,\u201d says Stefano. \u201cExciting and glamorous.\u201d There were new developments in Sally and Stefano\u2019s personal life too. They got married, a small church ceremony, with around 25 friends and family cheering them on. Sally took Stefano\u2019s last name, becoming Sally Ripamonti. \u201cAfterwards we lunched at Domus Aurea, which overlooked the Colosseum,\u201d says Sally, who calls the celebrations \u201cvery lovely and intimate.\u201d Sally and Stefano also welcomed their first child, a son. Sally was excited to raise her child in Italy. Italy \u2013 at least Sally\u2019s Italy \u2013 felt \u201cmore open and so much freer,\u201d than the US. Sally and Stefano had a vast group of friends who were open-minded, liberal thinkers. Many of them were gay, and to Sally, there seemed to be more queer acceptance than in early 1970s America. New opportunities Sally and Stefano spent five years living in Italy, welcoming another son, before a job opportunity took the young family to the US. In 1975, Stefano took the business helm at Halston, the forward-thinking American fashion design house whose avant garde designs were storming the fashion world in the 1970s. \u201cHalston is arguably considered still today the greatest fashion designer in the history of American Haute Couture,\u201d says Stefano. \u201cThat association with him changed our life and launched me into an increasingly interesting, challenging and successful career path.\u201d In Chicago, the couple established a \u201crather glamorous social life,\u201d to rival the one they\u2019d enjoyed in Rome. They socialized with the big name 1970s artists, actors, musicians and fashion designers. Meanwhile, Sally and Stefano went on to have two more children, and Sally balanced family life with her passion for painting. Moving to the US was interesting because the couple saw the \u201ctables turn\u201d in many ways. When she first arrived in Italy, Sally was \u201csort of clueless\u201d about how everything worked \u2013 from bills to grocery stores \u2013 so Stefano took the lead. In the US, Sally was familiar with the American system and the lifestyle. She started managing the family affairs. There were other adjustments too. \u201cWhen it came to making friends \u2013 in Italy, I was the star \u2013 \u2018l\u2019Americana.\u2019 Suddenly, I was just another American,\u201d says Sally, laughing. \u201cAnd he was the \u2018Italiano\u2019 \u2013 everybody wanted to meet Stefano.\u201d While Sally enjoyed being closer to her parents and sisters, she found she \u201cmissed a lot of things about Italy.\u201d She and Stefano visited whenever they could. \u201cWe went back and forth a million times with the kids,\u201d says Sally. \u201cThey always knew the grandparents in both places.\u201d Sally and Stefano brought up their kids with a sense of openness, and instilled in them a thirst for travel. One of their sons now lives in Thailand, while another of their sons fell in love with his future wife during a period living in Japan. They\u2019re now married and bringing up kids with Japanese, American and Italian heritage. \u201cThey\u2019re used to this bicultural idea,\u201d says Sally of her children. \u201cThey\u2019re very open. Our kids have a broad vision.\u201d Life as a \u2018pinball machine\u2019 Today, Sally, who is now in her late seventies, and Stefano, who is in his early eighties, live in San Francisco, California, in an apartment overlooking the bay. Over the past few decades the couple have lived across the US \u2013 from New York City to Arizona to Las Vegas, where Stefano worked in the hospitality business. Stefano retired in 2022, while Sally continues to paint. The couple\u2019s life revolves around travel, time with family \u2013 including their four grandchildren \u2013 enjoying their hobbies and spending quality time together. Stefano says when he looks back on his life, he finds himself thinking about a \u201cpinball machine.\u201d There\u2019s a randomness to life, he says, you never know what might happen. \u201cLife, especially mine and Sally\u2019s, ours, has been absolutely full of unexpected things,\u201d he says. \u201cBut life is made like that. Opportunities open up \u2013 and if you are creative, curious, you grab it and see where it goes.\u201d When Sally and Stefano look back on the moment they met, in the Plaza Hotel lobby in 1970, they\u2019re still struck by the fortuity of their encounter \u2013 the idea that if Stefano had \u201cgotten up from that bench at the Plaza one second before\u201d life would be different, \u201cnothing in this story would have happened,\u201d as Stefano puts it. But their overwhelming emotion is a feeling of gratitude, they\u2019re glad they \u201ctook a huge leap,\u201d as Sally describes, embarking on a life together. They\u2019re continuing this mantra into the future \u2013 later this year, Sally and Stefano plan to relocate back to Italy. \u201cAt our age people say, \u2018Are you crazy? You\u2019re starting a whole new life,\u2019\u2019 says Sally. \u201cWe go \u2018Yeah, we are crazy.\u2019\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the pinball machine,\u201d explains Stefano. \u201cLife is an adventure,\u201d says Sally. \u201cYou have to be willing to always stay open to its challenges and rewards. Nothing much happens if you stay at home.\u201d \u201cWe both had a sixth sense we were right for each,\u201d says Stefano. \u201cAnd we would do it again.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/plaza-hotel-couple-chance-encounters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_uk-rock-candy-cheap-imports", "text": "For over 100 years, it has been a staple of the British seaside \u2013 one so classic that one of the best-known novels of the 20th century took its name from it. But rock \u2013 a super-sweet hard candy shaped into long sticks, usually with the name of the resort \u201cwritten\u201d within \u2013 is looking under threat, as local manufacturers say that they are being put out of business by cheap imports. Buying a stick of rock at the seaside has been a typical rite of passage for Brits ever since the candy first swept across the country in a sugary rush, which is thought to have been at the beginning of the 20th century or even a little earlier. By 1938, when author Graham Greene wrote his novel \u201cBrighton Rock\u201d \u2013 which was named after the candy \u2013 he used the snack as a metaphor for morality. Protagonist Ida \u2013 a woman who was pursuing justice against a gang, alone \u2013 says that that people\u2019s characters stay the same throughout their lives, just as the words in a stick of rock run the whole way through. In fact, those famous letters in a piece of rock are handcrafted by artisans, usually in Blackpool, a seaside resort in Lancashire, northwest England. Now the 10 remaining factories in the town say that the industry is at risk, with cheap rock imported from China threatening their business. Their owners have written to the government asking for the UK\u2019s handmade rock to be given protected status \u2013 so that only the candy produced in the country can call itself \u201crock.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very recent problem,\u201d David Thorp, director of Stanton & Novelty Confectioners, one of Blackpool\u2019s 10 rock-makers who wrote the letter, told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been aware of Chinese confectionery and we\u2019ve even sold some ourselves, but it\u2019s been weird and wonderful lollies (lollipops) or marshmallows. But when they started making sticks of rock was when we sat up and needed to do something.\u201d Stanton & Novelty make rock for around 150 seaside towns around the UK \u2013 with each town\u2019s name embedded in the candy. Thorp\u2019s grandfather started the business in 1969. \u201cIt was crazy busy back then \u2013 they couldn\u2019t make enough, didn\u2019t have enough hours in the day.\u201d Now, he says, they have had to diversify their offering, producing lollipops as well as rock, to stay afloat. Fourteen employees work at the factory, as well as Thorp\u2019s parents. His father has worked there for 35 years. When his grandfather started, there were over 30 rock factories in Blackpool alone. But, says Thorp, \u201cEight [factories] have closed in the last two or three years. I\u2019d imagine two more may well close this year.\u201d The UK factories cannot compete on price. \u201cChinese rock is being sold for 12-15p ($0.15-$0.19) per stick, and we\u2019re trying to compete but it\u2019s unsustainable to do so, and becomes economically unviable,\u201d he says. Although Thorp says that Brexit isn\u2019t a direct factor, he says that his cost of ingredients has gone up since the UK left the EU \u2013 as much of the sugar and glucose they use comes from continental Europe. The cost of living crisis in the UK, including soaring energy bills, has made it even harder. Memories of childhood For many Brits, a stick of rock is synonymous with childhood trips to the seaside. \u201cPeople relate it to childhood \u2013 whether that\u2019s their own childhood, or their children\u2019s, or their grandchildren\u2019s,\u201d says Thorp. Of course, most Brits now prefer to hop on a budget airline for some European sun than head to a UK beach \u2013 but Thorp says that even with the change in vacation habits, it was still possible to make a living producing rock. \u201cIf you had a good summer, a nice Easter or a hot half-term holiday, you could always tell,\u201d he says. \u201cI know holidays have changed but it gives people the nostalgia for family holidays.\u201d In Blackpool, making rock is real artisan work. Sugar and glucose are boiled with water, then laid on cold slabs to dry, as coloring is added. While still soft, the different colored batches are \u201cpulled\u201d into strips, and then rolled into large cylinder shapes. Workers compose the letters by hand, using differently colored candy, while the cylinders are still in their original large form \u2013 almost the size of a forearm in diameter. Workers then stretch and compress the cylinders of rock into the inch-thick sticks that go on sale \u2013\u00a0all by hand. It\u2019s a job that requires expertise: at Promotional Candy \u2013 whose owner, Jason Evans, was another of the co-signees of the letter \u2013 the confectioners have a combined 80 years of experience. Thorp says that the imported candy from China doesn\u2019t have the lettering running through the rock, as the expertise is not there yet. But that doesn\u2019t stop distributors and retailers stocking it over more expensive, locally produced candy. \u201cI get quite emotional thinking about [closing down] because we\u2019ve been going for over 55 years,\u201d he says. \u201cThis factory is my family\u2019s identity. It\u2019d be completely heartbreaking.\u201d \u2018We don\u2019t stand a chance\u2019 The business owners who have signed the letter want the government to protect the word \u201crock\u201d or \u201crock stick\u201d in the same way that the UK protects other food and drink: Cornish pasties, Scotch whisky, Wensleydale cheese and Melton Mowbray pork pies can only use these names if they are made in the place they name-check. But rather than keeping it to Blackpool, the rock-makers want candy made anywhere in the UK to qualify, to allow more homegrown producers to take advantage. \u201cThere are very few products that bring up the amount of nostalgia a stick of rock from the seaside does,\u201d says Thorp. \u201cIt\u2019s a sort of national heritage.\u201d Shipping in candy from China also has an environmental cost, he adds. Anita McAleese, owner of McAdams Confectionery and another co-signer of the letter, told CNN that most consumers have no idea that the stick of candy they\u2019re buying has been made in China. \u201cWe don\u2019t really stand a chance if there\u2019s not public awareness,\u201d she says. McAleese\u2019s husband started the business in 1995. \u201cIt was a thriving industry when we started \u2013 there were 18 factories in Blackpool and there was no competition between us because there was enough [business] to go around,\u201d she says. Her 14 employees have slumped to just six since the imported rock started taking hold. \u201ct\u2019s the retailers looking for the cheapest [option],\u201d she says. \u201cI had one distributor who was probably 50% of my work \u2013 and he has gone for the imported rock.\u201d Thorp says that if the homegrown industry goes under, \u201cIt\u2019d be a massive shame.\u201d \u201cSticks of rock are over 100 years old, and a national treasure. It\u2019s part of our shared culture,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll do anything to stop that happening.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/uk-rock-candy-cheap-imports/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_article_how-to-survive-alligator-attack", "text": "Jeffrey Heim woke up on May 30, 2021, with one thing on his mind: Sharks.  Specifically, shark teeth. They\u2019re his passion and his business. An unsuccessful attempt the day before to find any of them only fueled his obsession to find some on his next outing, he told CNN Travel recently. So on a hot, sunny Sunday in Sarasota County, Florida, the 25-year-old Heim proceeded to the Myakka River on a spot about 45 minutes from the Gulf of Mexico. He had been there numerous times and was comfortable with plunging into its murky waters to find the teeth of extinct megalodons in the riverbed. He put on his wetsuit, mask, fins and snorkel and entered the water from the shore, not far from a restaurant along the riverbank.  Heim slipped beneath the surface. He was under no more than one minute when he felt something. Something bad. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything, didn\u2019t see anything. I just felt like a blunt force object \u2013 like someone \u2026 swinging a baseball bat and just whacking my head. But mostly what I felt was what I thought was a huge boat just slamming into me and just pulling me down.\u201d To his shock, it wasn\u2019t a boat.  He was in the water, alone and face-to-face with an alligator.  Gator attacks: Rare but fascinating   Heim was in a situation many people probably fear but very few actually experience: an attack by an alligator. An estimated 5 million wild American alligators are spread out across 10 states in Southeast and beyond, including parts of North Carolina and even the extreme southeastern tip of Oklahoma. Louisiana has an estimated 2 million wild gators in a state of about 4.65 million people. Florida sports roughly 1.25 million alligators (and more than 1,000 American crocodiles). Georgia has about a quarter of a million. Some of these gators inhabit places where lots of people live and many others vacation, such as lakes and rivers all across Florida and coastal South Carolina. Yet gator attacks aren\u2019t that frequent and deaths even more infrequent (deadly attacks from dogs and horses and other mammals are more common). There were 442 unprovoked bite incidents in Florida from 1948 to 2021, and 26 of these bites resulted in people dying, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conversation Commission. It turns out gators, in natural conditions, simply aren\u2019t that interested in people, according to Kimberly Andrews, a gator and snake expert with a doctorate in ecology from University of Georgia\u2019s Marine Extension and Georgia Sea Grant and who manages its Coastal Ecology Lab.  \u201cWe are not their prey. If you think about it, we\u2019re quite dangerous to attack. We\u2019ve got arms and legs. We can stand upright. We can walk, we can swim. \u2026 We\u2019re not a good animal to pick a fight with.\u201d \u201cUnless they\u2019re confronted, they\u2019re going to stay on their own turf.\u201d Nonetheless, people continue to be fascinated by such possible encounters. Overblown reputation     Andrews wants to dispel the notion of gators as aggressive, ravenous menaces on the move. \u201cThey\u2019re called ambush predators. We also call these \u2018sit-and-wait\u2019 predators,\u201d she said.  They\u2019re large, so it\u2019s \u201cenergetically costly for them to be really active. \u2026 We would be considered an active forager. We go out and find our food.\u201d Not so with gators. \u201cWhen you come down to it, they\u2019re not that maneuverable. Large body. Small legs. And this also plays into why the perception of their danger is exaggerated from the actuality.\u201d  Nonetheless, caution is advised when you\u2019re in gator territory, be that at golf courses, swamps, lakes, rivers and hiking and bike trails and fishing spots along waterways. Best defense: Avoid an attack  Education is key to avoiding a bad encounter, Andrews said. Start with knowing when gators are most active. Courtship season starts as spring warms up; mating extends in early summer; and in Okefenokee Swamp in southeastern Georgia, \u201cwe start to see eggs hatch out starting in September and October. \u2026 And that\u2019s when the females are most protective when they feel someone is threatening their babies,\u201d Andrews said. Your best season is winter: If it\u2019s cold, \u201cthey\u2019re not doing whole lot.\u201d When temperatures start settling into the 80s (27 Celsius), gators become mostly nocturnal. So it\u2019s best to avoid that refreshing night dip in unknown waters when it\u2019s hot. Don\u2019t provoke, don\u2019t feed, don\u2019t panic   Unprovoked attacks are rare, Andrews said. People are usually the provocateurs, not the gators. Gators can be disturbed or confused when folks have been known to try to grab them by their tails or go in for close-up photos of sunning gators Even worse, people will feed them. Then the reptiles start to associate humans with food. That\u2019s when gators can be most dangerous \u2013 when they\u2019ve lost their natural fear or disinterest in people. \u201cThey\u2019re more likely to take the easy way out and get our food than to do the work to fight for it,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cIn areas where we have high rates of tourism but not a lot of education and oversight of how people are interacting with alligators, we see feeding issues.\u201d  If you do have a gator encounter, she suggests staying calm and respecting its territory  \u201cSay you\u2019re kayaking, and you see an alligator, just keep going past it. Give it a wide berth, as much as the space will allow,\u201d Andrews said.  \u201cDon\u2019t take the paddles and slap the water. Sometimes people do that to scare the alligator off,\u201d but you\u2019re actually indicating you\u2019re a direct threat.  \u201cIf for some reason they start to swim toward you \u2026 usually try to go in the other direction and just show you\u2019re not interested. Or paddle right on by and ignore the animal.\u201d Also, never mess with the reptiles\u2019 children. \u201cWe always tell people that those one-foot baby alligators, even though they\u2019re so cute, they\u2019re the most dangerous sized alligator to mess with.\u201d That\u2019s because there\u2019s possibly a nearby mother ready to protect her young. More ways to avoid an attack   Authoritative websites have plenty of good advice to avoid a dangerous encounter. From the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory at the University of Georgia: \u2022 Don\u2019t feed ducks, turtles or other animals that share waters with alligators.  \u2022 Stay about 60 feet (18 meters) or more away from an adult alligator. If an alligator hisses or lunges at you, you are too close. \u2022 If you\u2019re driving, let an alligator cross the road. They move across roadways the most often in spring and summer.  \u2022 Supervise pets and children when you\u2019re in gator territory. \u201cLarge alligators do not recognize the difference between domestic pets and wild food sources,\u201d the SREL says. \u2022 Avoid heavy vegetation in and near the water\u2019s edge.  The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission also advises: \u2022 Never swim outside of posted areas, and swim only during daylight hours. Alligators are most active between dusk and dawn. \u2022 Get rid of fish scraps in garbage cans at boat ramps and fish camps; don\u2019t toss them in the water. Experts also advise people to call local or state authorities if you see alligators roaming around neighbors and other places you wouldn\u2019t expect. Do not try to handle the reptiles yourself. As for Jeffrey Heim, these tips were more than theory. Mission: Survival   Heim was in serious trouble, and he knew it. The gator had already bit him in the skull and on the hand. And it was coming toward him again. The gator \u201cpulled my mask off and pulled my head down towards my stomach. And then I come up, head above water. I no longer have the mask with the GoPro that\u2019s filming. And we\u2019re both looking at each other, and we both sit there for about two or three seconds, and I feel my head.\u201d  He wasn\u2019t sure what he was feeling at the time, but he learned later it was his scalp, partially torn off his skull and flapping in the water. Then \u201cshe lunges at me and I back away calmly \u2026  like I would with my experience with sharks, you don\u2019t want to act like prey. So I just backed away to keep my space.\u201d \u201cAnd then she really aggressively lunged at me \u2026\u201d  What to do if you\u2019re attacked   Heaven forbid you\u2019re that person like Heim who is being attacked by an alligator. Would you know what to do? If the gator is trying to drag you under the water, \u201cyou have to assume at this point you\u2019re fighting for your life, and you\u2019ve got to give it all you\u2019ve got,\u201d Andrews said.  \u201cWe recommend trying to poke them in the eye, hitting them in the top part of the skull or the side of the jaw. Those points are sensitive on alligators just like they are on us,\u201d she said. In a water attack, the danger is more from drowning than the bite, Andrews said. So get to land if possible. \u201cWe\u2019re better on land than they are. They\u2019re better in the water.\u201d But don\u2019t assume all is safe if you\u2019re on land. And the alligator has more in its arsenal that a fearsome set of teeth.  You can be injured if you\u2019re hit by the tail. Gators can also whip around with their skull and use it like a battering ram. Andrews knows first-hand how dangerous that can be.   She was part of a capture team once that had a gator taped up and its mouth secured when it unexpectedly whipped its head around.  \u201cIt actually hit me broad with the side of its head across my shins \u2026 and I blacked out. And I wondered, \u2018Oh my gosh, did I fracture my shin bone?\u2019 I had a lump the size of a tennis ball. It is amazing how muscular and powerful they are,\u201d Andrews recalled. The gator uses its mouth. Use yours. \u201cScream, make as much noise [as you can], not only fight back but make yourself as big and as much a pain in the rear end as you possibly can.\u201d If people are nearby, they should call 911 for help, Andrews said. If a pole is nearby, someone can beat on the gator and give it another target.  \u201cAnother person in an attempt to rescue you should never come in the water after you and the alligator. They can help you most by being on the ground and helping you get to the ground,\u201d Andrews said.  Other ways to fend off an attack   Here are some more survival tips from various wildlife departments and other experts: \u2022 If you can escape on land, run away in a straight line. Experts debunk the advice to zig-zag. Gators can move really fast on land, but only in short bursts and distances before they tire out. \u2022 Try to cause a gag reflex by jamming any objects you can reach into the back of the alligator\u2019s mouth. \u2022 Sometimes a gator will reposition its prey in its mouth. With its jaw back open, that is your chance to escape. \u2022 \u201cAlligators clamp down with powerful jaws, then twist and roll. If an alligator bites your arm, it may help to grab the alligator and roll with it to reduce tearing of the arm,\u201d according to advice from the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources. \u2022 Get immediate medical attention if bitten. Alligator bites often result in serious infection.   All of this is specific to American alligators, Andrews emphasizes.  Other crocodilian species in places such as Africa and Australia can be more aggressive. We\u2019re actually prey-sized for some of these, she said.  But the relatively few crocodiles in southern Florida aren\u2019t known for attacking people. The escape   One of Andrews\u2019 survival tips came in very hand handy as the female gator lunged yet again at Heim. \u201cI really backed away. Got out of that river as quickly as I could. I climbed out of the six-foot bank and stumbled over to the parking lot.\u201d He was about to pass out, but he was able \u201cto yell over to some people over at that restaurant.\u201d Fortunately, they heard his cries for help and were able to assist him with a first aid kit from the restaurant and call 911. While waiting for the paramedics, he wasn\u2019t in pain. But \u201cthe whole time I\u2019m sitting down just super loopy and exhausted. That\u2019s when I thought I was going to die.\u201d He ended up in the ICU in a hospital for two days but was back at work the next week \u201cwith staples in my head.\u201d  Lessons learned   Heim has now had time to reflect on what he did that day and on what others can learn from his attack. \u201cI knew there were gators there. This day, I basically did everything wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cI was aware it was gator mating season, but I went to the river with too much confidence, especially being alone, and free diving, which I had never done in that river before.\u201d \u201cThat cockiness, or confidence, led to the bite, honestly, even though this was an uncharacteristically aggressive alligator apparently. It was still the wrong time of year to go.\u201d  Like other young people who have spent time in the watery wilds in the Southeast, he was lulled into a false sense of security because he had been around gators before with no ill results. \u201cI was casually looking around for gators, but if I had even seen one, I had dove with them before and it hadn\u2019t caused an issue.\u201d \u201cI think the difference was this was near a restaurant, and fed gators are the most aggressive gators. So that\u2019s what the gator professionals believe contributed to this attack, too,\u201d Heim said.   \u201cIf you\u2019re going to dive in a river like that, which I don\u2019t suggest anymore, don\u2019t free dive. You\u2019re going to go up and down like their prey. And you\u2019re going to look much smaller that you actually are.\u201d \u201cWeigh all risks. Anything can happen at anytime to anyone. None of us are invincible. And I think it was the youth in me being a little too confident.\u201d  Heim has been chastened, but not chased off. He continues to search for shark teeth and has ramped up operations for his business, SHRKco. His approach is different now. He\u2019s more cautious. He said he has more and better equipment. He\u2019s even been diving back in the Myakka twice since the attack. However, he now goes with other people, including gator experts.  Andrews said it\u2019s crucial for people to co-exist with alligators because they\u2019re an Indispensable part of the ecology as an apex predator keeping populations of other animals in check. \u201cIn the South, they\u2019re part of our heritage. What a charismatic and iconic feature of our landscapes. It should be: We like our sweet tea. We like our grits. We like our alligators. This is part of who we are.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/article/how-to-survive-alligator-attack/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_vacation-fling-love-story-chance-encounters", "text": "Guillermo Barrantes relationship with Larry Mock was supposed to begin and end in Palm Springs. It was a \u201ccasual, brief encounter.\u201d A vacation dalliance that only lasted half a day. \u201cIt was just so casual, so easily nothing could have happened from it,\u201d Guillermo tells CNN Travel. \u201cWe could have walked away and just had our lives separate. But of course that didn\u2019t happen, because it wasn\u2019t meant to be that way. It was meant to be the way that it was. That it is.\u201d It all started in summer 2013. Guillermo - then in his early 40s - was on vacation in the California resort city of Palm Springs. He was in a phase of life where, he says, he was prioritizing himself, and wasn\u2019t interested in long term romance. \u201cI thrived in being by myself, in traveling by myself, in having dinner by myself \u2013 I loved all of that so much,\u201d says Guillermo, who lived in Boston, Massachusetts at the time. \u201cI wanted no commitment, I wanted no emotional entanglement of any kind. I wanted to have fun, get to know myself. And it was in that mode that I met Larry, when I wasn\u2019t really looking.\u201d During the vacation in Palm Springs, Guillermo was staying at a friend\u2019s apartment, and while the friend worked during the day, Guillermo passed his time at a \u201crun-down, no-frills\u201d resort a couple of blocks away. \u201cYou could just pay for a day pass, they\u2019d give you a towel, and you could be in the pool and use their bar,\u201d he recalls. One day, as he was walking the palm tree-lined streets to the resort, Guillermo swiped right on a guy on a dating app \u2013 Larry Mock, mid-40s, friendly smile. The two men exchanged a few messages back and forth. Larry said he was also on vacation in Palm Springs, staying in the resort Guillermo kept frequenting. They arranged to meet there for a drink by the pool. Guillermo was looking forward to meeting Larry, expecting \u201csome casual fun.\u201d Then, when Guillermo and Larry met, there was \u201cchemistry\u201d right away. Guillermo calls their connection \u201cmagnetic.\u201d \u201cMy impression of Larry: sexy, handsome and warm,\u201d he recalls. Larry was a Texas-based American Airlines flight attendant who\u2019d booked the vacation to Palm Springs at the last minute. He\u2019d recently broken up with a long-term partner but due to lease and budget reasons the two were still living together \u2013 awkwardly \u2013 in Dallas, Texas. Larry\u2019s workdays were spent traveling the world. But during his downtime, he struggled to relax in the apartment with his ex, and this sentiment motivated the spontaneous vacation. \u201cI needed to get out of town for the weekend, because we were just butting heads badly at that time,\u201d Larry tells CNN Travel today. Larry searched his airline\u2019s database, looking at destinations he could visit using the last minute, standby flight tickets available for flight attendants. \u201cPalm Springs had seats, so I booked my standby flight, got to Palm Springs, checked into this resort. And that\u2019s where Guillermo came into the picture,\u201d says Larry. Larry was instantly attracted to Guillermo. He thought he was \u201cjust the most handsome guy\u201d he\u2019d ever seen. And as they got chatting, and Guillermo kept making Larry laugh, Larry sketched out his first impression to include two more adjectives: \u201cso funny, and so kind.\u201d In passing, as the two flirted over pool-side cocktails, Larry mentioned that he was a flight attendant. Guillermo lit up. In fact, his response was \u201cgiddy,\u201d as Larry recalls it. \u201cHe started asking me tons of questions about planes, and flight attendants, and the routes and all of that kind of stuff.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a huge aviation geek,\u201d explains Guillermo. As a kid growing up in Costa Rica, he\u2019d wanted to be a pilot. Instead, he ended up working as an IT consultant. And while he says he was good at that job, liked it well enough and made good money \u2013 he still dreamed about working in aviation. Meeting a flight attendant was fascinating. \u201cI was immediately drawn to his career,\u201d says Guillermo. Larry found Guillermo\u2019s enthusiasm for aviation charming, and happily answered his questions. Later that evening, Larry and Guillermo said their goodbyes, with no plans to meet again. \u201cI was glad to meet him,\u201d says Larry. \u201cBut I was like, \u2018There\u2019s no way I am going to pursue dating somebody that lived in Boston.\u2019 And I still was dealing with what I was dealing with in Dallas.\u201d \u201cWe just really enjoyed the time that we had together,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cBut we went our separate ways.\u201d Unexpected moments Almost without realizing \u2013 and certainly without intending to \u2013 Guillermo and Larry stayed in touch. \u201cWe kept chatting, we kept texting,\u201d says Guillermo. Then, a few days after meeting Larry, Guillermo got an unexpected phone call from his mother in Costa Rica. He was still in Palm Springs at the time. \u201cShe said, \u2018I don\u2019t want you to freak out, but I just got diagnosed with breast cancer. I don\u2019t want you to change the trip.\u2019\u201d Guillermo tried to protest, but his mother insisted he should enjoy the rest of his vacation. She reassured him that her sisters and Guillermo\u2019s father were taking care of her, and she\u2019d see Guillermo later in the month \u2013 he already had a trip to Costa Rica scheduled for that summer. Not wanting to go against his mother\u2019s wishes, Guillermo stayed put in the desert. He tried to \u201ccompartmentalize\u201d the news, but he was really close to his mom, and it was cataclysmic. Later, back home in Boston, Guillermo found himself sharing his mother\u2019s news with Larry, and confiding in him about his fears and worries. He added that his mother lived in Costa Rica, so he\u2019d likely be flying back and forth for the rest of the year. Larry was supportive, empathetic \u2013 and he told Guillermo that he should use the discounted flights Larry got through work. Guillermo was taken aback \u2013 it was \u201csuch a sweet gesture\u201d from someone who was basically a stranger. But then, somehow, Larry already felt much more than that. \u201cVery early on, he and I had just beautiful interactions, and it revealed the kind of person that he was,\u201d he says. And so, rather than dwindling, Larry and Guillermo\u2019s communication increased as the days rolled on. \u201cWithin just a few weeks, we just knew \u2013 without much discussion, without talking about it \u2013 we just knew that there was a very, very strong connection there,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cWe always had something to talk about,\u201d says Larry. Larry was still hesitant about jumping into something new, following the breakdown of his previous relationship. But the messages back and forth with Guillermo became a highlight of his day. And as time passed, he found himself opening up to Guillermo, confiding in him. \u201cAfter a few months, I was like, \u2018Yes, this is exactly what I was looking for my whole life. Someone that I can be my authentic self with,\u2019\u201d says Larry. Long-distance dating In September 2013, two months after their Palm Springs meeting, Larry arranged to visit Guillermo in Boston. At Logan Airport, Larry came down the escalator and spotted Guillermo\u2019s face in the crowd. He was beaming, and started running towards Larry. Then, Guillermo \u201chugged me so hard,\u201d recalls Larry. He remembers thinking, \u201cOh my god, this is the one.\u201d Then Guillermo and Larry went to Boston\u2019s seaport district together, and found a sundrenched rooftop bar where they sat drinking beers. \u201cWe could see the planes approaching Logan, and it was just a sunny and perfect Boston day,\u201d recalls Guillermo. \u201cI remember that, like a picture, sitting by the edge \u2013 I remember the beer and I remember the planes.\u201d It was \u201cmagical,\u201d says Guillermo, but also slightly \u201csurreal.\u201d The Palm Springs encounter was so brief. He never thought he\u2019d see Larry again. And now here Larry was, sitting opposite him, in Guillermo\u2019s city. From there, Guillermo and Larry started dating cross-country. They took advantage of Larry\u2019s discounted flights. Sometimes Larry traveled to Boston, but usually Guillermo visited Larry in Dallas. Guillermo\u2019s love of flying meant that, for him, the four-hour journey across the country was part of the fun. \u201cI was in heaven,\u201d he says. \u201cJust the fact that I was getting to do something that I have always just loved - which is being on an airplane and going somewhere.\u201d Each Friday, as he packed his bag and headed to the airport, Guillermo would also be struck with \u201cexcitement\u201d at the thought of seeing Larry. And during these weekend visits, Guillermo and Larry grew accustomed to each other\u2019s habits, how they moved through their days, how they liked to spend their time. Guillermo got to know Larry\u2019s friends and got to know Dallas as a city. They spoke about their hopes, dreams, ambitions and families. Guillermo says it was obvious that they were \u201cvery aligned on the important aspects of life: how we view finances, closeness with families, politically and world views and enjoyment of the small things in life.\u201d Larry supported Guillermo as he cared for his mother through her cancer, and celebrated with him when she recovered. \u201cFor us, it was a gradual process of falling in love,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cBut a theme for us in our life together is that everything felt right and natural.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t pinpoint the moment, but we simply knew very deep in our hearts that we found the life partner.\u201d \u201cThat made me so happy,\u201d says Larry. For Guillermo, moving to Dallas two years later, in late 2015, was \u201cjust as the easiest decision.\u201d Larry was thrilled. His Dallas-based friendship group had already welcomed Guillermo into the fold, and his parents were happy for him too. \u201cI introduced Guillermo to everybody,\u201d says Larry. \u201cMy family\u2019s always been very accepting of me.\u201d Guillermo\u2019s family situation was more complicated. He\u2019s always been very close with his parents and siblings, but for the first two decades of his adult life, he didn\u2019t talk to his family about relationships. \u201cMy personal life was not necessarily an open book,\u201d Guillermo says. \u201cLove has never been the question - my parents love me, I love my parents and my sisters, we all get along great. But there was always that invisible barrier, which was: I don\u2019t talk about my personal relationships.\u201d But Guillermo didn\u2019t want to hide Larry from anyone - he felt he owed that to himself, and to Larry. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to edit myself, I wasn\u2019t going to filter. I just knew deep in my heart that it was my chance to be able to truly be myself,\u201d he says. So Guillermo started peppering his phone calls home with mentions of Larry. He uploaded cute photos of the two of them to social media. \u201cI\u2019m fearless,\u201d he told himself. \u201cNothing bad can happen here.\u201d A monumental year Cut to 2018, which was a monumental year for Guillermo and Larry for a couple of reasons. For one, it was the year Guillermo followed in Larry\u2019s footsteps and became a flight attendant. It was a mutual friend who suggested Guillermo should give it a shot, and Larry \u2013 who\u2019d spent years listening to Guillermo wax lyrical about airplanes \u2013 was wholeheartedly encouraging. Guillermo applied to Larry\u2019s airline, American Airlines, but wasn\u2019t accepted. But then he applied to Delta, and was accepted on the spot. While Guillermo and Larry loved the idea of working together, flying with different airlines also \u201cworked out great,\u201d says Guillermo. For one, there were two different sets of airline benefits to enjoy. And working in the air was everything Guillermo hoped it would be and more. \u201cI was doing my dream job, my childhood dream job,\u201d he says. \u201cI still have to pinch myself that actually, I am a flight attendant.\u201d 2018 was also the year Guillermo and Larry got married. Guillermo proposed to Larry on an airplane. The couple were flying back to Dallas after visiting San Francisco, where they\u2019d attended an Adele concert. As they were descending, the Dallas lights glistening out the airplane window, Guillermo suddenly felt the time was right. He turned to Larry and asked him to marry him. Larry smiled, and said yes. \u201cDespite it being impromptu, as an aviation geek, I love that I proposed on a flight,\u201d says Guillermo. The couple started planning their nuptials. Guillermo was excited, but he was unsure what role \u2013 if any \u2013 his family would play on the wedding day. While Guillermo had mentioned Larry to his parents, they still hadn\u2019t met him. This was partly because Guillermo\u2019s family were in Costa Rica, and partly because Guillermo wasn\u2019t sure how that meeting would play out. \u201cThe person that I had the most trouble with was my father \u2013 because he was the one that had the hardest time really accepting me,\u201d says Guillermo. As plans for the wedding started to take shape, Guillermo composed a long email to his father. \u201cI said something to the effect of, \u2018Hey Dad, I know I really haven\u2019t really talked much about any of my personal life. But I met this person, Larry, who is the love of my life. We are going to get married. Come, don\u2019t come, no problem. But I just need to tell you because this is probably one of the most important days and times of my life.\u2019\u201d Guillermo\u2019s father didn\u2019t attend the wedding. \u201cFor those reasons and also because he was towards the end of his life, his mobility was a problem,\u201d Guillermo says. \u201cBut my mom, my sisters, my niece and my nephew came, which was far more than I ever imagined or dreamed. That was such a great moment.\u201d Guillermo introduced his mother and sisters to Larry a couple of days before the wedding. They all gathered at a rooftop bar in Dallas, along with Guillermo and Larry\u2019s close friends. When Guillermo\u2019s mother saw Larry for the first time, she enveloped Larry in her arms. The two hit it off right away. Guillermo was overwhelmed with happiness. \u201cFor me, to see Larry and mom interact \u2013 they just love each other so much,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cAnd my sisters just cannot get enough of him \u2013 I just sit back, and just enjoy.\u201d A magical wedding day Guillermo and Larry\u2019s wedding took place at the Dallas Arboretum, a botanical garden. It was an outdoor wedding, and the couple woke up to the rain pouring and concerned texts from guests worried how the wedding would play out in a downpour. \u201cBut then, sure enough, out came the sun at the right time,\u201d recalls Guillermo. Larry and Guillermo wrote their own vows and read them to each other during the ceremony. Guillermo told Larry that he inspired him to be a better son, sibling, friend and person. \u201cYou want a partner that is going to challenge you to be better,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cI always feel that I want to be a better human being just in general, because he is such a figure in my life and everyone\u2019s life \u2013 he is the center of everybody\u2019s life.\u201d In turn, Larry promised Guillermo their married life would be \u201cexciting, adventurous and full of passion.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m proud to take you as my husband. I promise to fly with you to the ends of the earth,\u201d Larry said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to grow old together and look back at this beautiful moment.\u201d He ended the vows telling Guillermo: \u201cTe amo\u201d \u2013 Spanish for \u201cI love you.\u201d The reception was held at a local winery. During the celebrations, Guillermo and Larry danced to Rihanna\u2019s hit \u201cWe Found Love,\u201d which includes the lyric: \u201cWe found love in a hopeless place.\u201d The couple felt it was fitting \u2013 the resort they met at did seem a bit of a \u201chopeless place.\u201d And they never expected that brief meeting would lead to a lasting love. \u201cWe made sure that song was played, because we did find love in a hopeless place,\u201d says Larry. \u201cAnd I love Rihanna, too,\u201d says Guillermo. At one point, Guillermo and Larry walked through the reception doors holding hands, spontaneously lifting their arms in the air, a \u201cvictorious\u201d pose, as Guillermo put it. \u201cIt was just an electric effect,\u201d he says. The last piece of the puzzle A few years into their marriage, Guillermo and Larry visited Costa Rica together for the first time. Larry was excited to see Guillermo\u2019s home country, and Guillermo was excited to show his husband where he grew up \u2013 and the visit was also an opportunity for Larry to finally meet Guillermo\u2019s father. Guillermo was nervous about how the meeting would play out, but when he arrived at his parents\u2019 house with Larry in tow, Guillermo\u2019s father opened his arms and hugged Larry tightly. \u201cHe said, \u2018Welcome home,\u2019\u201d says Guillermo. It was a cathartic, emotional moment for everyone. \u201cI was so nervous that day, meeting the father-in-law,\u201d says Larry. \u201cAnd when he just said \u2018welcome home,\u2019 and hugged me, every bit of nerves went away. I felt comfortable, I felt welcomed, I felt loved.\u201d Larry says the moment felt like the \u201clast piece\u201d of a puzzle slotting into place. Guillermo was overjoyed. \u201cThat evening, which we got to spend \u2013 me, mom, dad, and Larry \u2013 was just a highlight,\u201d says Guillermo. The family played old records on a turntable. Guillermo and his mother danced in the living room, while Larry and Guillermo\u2019s father sipped cocktails and watched, laughing. \u201cI had to just step back, because you have to look at those moments and just kind of create a little mini movie of them,\u201d says Guillermo. Guillermo\u2019s father has since passed away, which makes Guillermo and Larry all the more grateful for that time together in Costa Rica. In general, a feeling of gratitude defines Guillermo and Larry\u2019s relationship \u2013 gratitude for each other and what they\u2019ve brought to one another\u2019s lives, and gratitude that their paths crossed over ten years ago. On their anniversary, the couple usually return to Palm Springs to celebrate the day they met. \u201cNot only is Palm Springs beautiful with a great vibe, but we love to go back and celebrate our meeting place,\u201d says Larry. \u201cWe weren\u2019t looking, neither one of us \u2013 but it did happen, and it\u2019s definitely for life.\u201d \u201cWhat a gift,\u201d says Guillermo, who says his life today is what he dreamed of \u201cas a little gay boy in Costa Rica, always loving the US, always loving airplanes, always envisioning that I would have a relationship where we are completely free to show our love.\u201d \u201cAnd we do, we do,\u201d he says. \u201cWho could ask for anything more?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/vacation-fling-love-story-chance-encounters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_lynn-rippelmeyer-first-female-747-pilot", "text": "Lynn Rippelmeyer\u2019s reach for the sky started from an unlikely place. \u201cI grew up on a farm in the 1950s. There were no women flying, there were no female airline pilots. I had an interest in aviation because there were airplanes flying overhead, and I thought how much fun it would be to see the world from up there. The closest I could come to pretending that was riding my horse up to the top of these limestone bluffs overlooking the Mississippi River, about a mile away from the farm, and imagine that the horse had wings \u2014 like Pegasus \u2014 and could soar and fly over the fields.\u201d So, she did the next best thing: become a flight attendant. She got hired in 1972 by TWA, then a major airline, and started working on the Queen of the Skies, the Boeing 747: \u201cIt had just come out, and TWA was one of the first airlines to fly it. I loved how it looked,\u201d she says. However, she was mostly curious about how it worked: \u201cIf I started asking questions about what was going on in the cockpit and asked [the flight crew] about their jobs and the airplane, we could have an almost intelligent adult conversation, and I could sit up there and enjoy it, so that\u2019s what I did.\u201d At the time, flight crews on large aircraft were made up of two pilots plus a flight engineer, who was easier to talk to because his seat was positioned behind those of the pilots. So, Rippelmeyer says, she could ask even more questions and learn even more about switches, hydraulics and engines. The next summer, she got serious about her passion and started taking flying lessons in Vermont, on a small Piper seaplane: \u201cI just loved it. It was the closest I\u2019ve ever been to being addicted to anything.\u201d In 1975, she learned that the first two female airline pilots in the United States \u2013 Bonnie Tiburzi at American Airlines and Emily Warner at Frontier \u2013 had been hired. Encouraged, she started the career pilot program for the role of flight engineer in Miami. She obtained her first commercial license in 1976. A historic moment, kept secret Rippelmeyer\u2019s first cockpit job came just a year later with a small commuter airline, Air Illinois, as first officer on a Twin Otter \u2014 a 20-passenger turboprop regional plane. The airline already had a female captain in its ranks, but upon hiring Rippelmeyer, the owner told her that they would be never flying together. \u201cI asked why, and he said, \u2018Well, we have to have a man up there in case anything goes wrong, don\u2019t we? And we also don\u2019t want to scare our passengers away, do we?\u2019 Because he was the owner, he could make whatever rules he wanted. And at that time, there was no law or regulation against it, so we just went with it.\u201d However, with only three airplanes and about 20 pilots, keeping the two women from flying together was a scheduling nightmare. \u201cOne day, we just had to \u2014 Emilie, the captain, was already there, but her first officer was sick and there was nobody else that could get to the airplane on time but me,\u201d Rippelmeyer said. She had the dispatcher call the owner of the airline and heard him screaming through the phone: \u201cHe said I could take the flight, but we couldn\u2019t make any announcements and we had to keep the cockpit door closed. Nobody had to know there were two women in there. So that\u2019s what we did.\u201d It was December 30, 1977, and that was the first scheduled flight in the United States with an all-female crew \u2013 but it was kept a secret. At least, \u201csince nobody died,\u201d Lippenmeyer says, the two were no longer intentionally kept apart and flew together many more times. However, her days at Air Illinois were numbered: \u201cThe pay for being a first-year pilot wasn\u2019t even enough to make rent,\u201d she says. To make ends meet, she was still working as a flight attendant, resulting in a grueling schedule: \u201cI couldn\u2019t do both. I tried for about a month and there should be a rule against it. But at Air Illinois, I had a goal: I needed 1,000 hours of gas-turbine flight time. And once I had that, there really wasn\u2019t any more reason to hang out there.\u201d Too short to be a pilot? With enough flight experience in her pocket, Rippelmeyer could take a crack at bigger airlines. One of them \u2014 the now defunct Ozark Air Lines \u2014 rejected her at the end of the interview process because, they said, at 5\u20194\u201d she was too short to be a pilot: \u201cI knew I wasn\u2019t, but again, they could make whatever rules they wanted.\u201d She got hired by TWA as a flight engineer, flying on the Boeing 727. The airline had two other female pilots, and they got along well. However, they all got furloughed just a week short of being off probation: \u201cYou can\u2019t wait to get off probation, because your salary doubles \u2014 the first year at any airline is poverty,\u201d she says. It was a blessing in disguise. Rippelmeyer found a job at a cargo carrier called Seaboard World Airlines \u2013 as first officer on the Boeing 747, flying out of JFK on transatlantic routes. \u201cIt was a very unique situation, because in most airlines, you started as a flight engineer \u2013 like I did at TWA \u2013 and then you worked your way up,\u201d she says. \u201cBut at Seaboard, they had professional engineers. Guys that did not have a pilot license and didn\u2019t care about upgrading to pilot. So when you got hired as a pilot, you immediately went to the first officer seat.\u201d The year was 1980, and Rippelmeyer had just become the first female pilot to fly the 747. \u201cI didn\u2019t even think a woman could do that,\u201d she says, because the male pilots she had worked with had told her it would be too difficult \u2013 psychologically and physically. \u201cThey had kind of convinced me there was a physical aspect to it. They told me that on four-engine airplanes, if two engines went out on one side, no woman would have the strength to push the rudder down to keep the airplane flying straight.\u201d But Captain Carl Hirschberg, an experienced pilot who was her superior and flight instructor, was excited about having a 747 female pilot and told her that she could. Better yet, he showed her how to do it. \u201cIn the simulator one day, he said we\u2019d have an engine failure on takeoff, and then a second failure on the same side. And that\u2019s not supposed to happen. It never happens. The first officer doesn\u2019t have to demonstrate that. But I didn\u2019t have time to think about it \u2014 I just had to deal with it.\u201d \u201cI came back around and landed with the two engines out. And it wasn\u2019t as good as he could have done it, but I managed it. My leg, from pushing on the rudder so hard for two engines, was just shaking. I couldn\u2019t stand up. Why would you do that to me? And he said, \u2018Because I\u2019m not having you up there thinking you can\u2019t do something that you can. And you\u2019re welcome.\u2019 \u201d Breaking records The dream didn\u2019t last long, because Rippelmeyer was furloughed once again: \u201cI was 30 years old at this point, didn\u2019t have a job, wasn\u2019t married, didn\u2019t have an income. Flying was not working out. I was wondering if I had messed up my life.\u201d Luckily, the deregulation of airlines \u2014 which removed federal control over routes and fares \u2014 led to an influx of newcomers on the market, and among these was an airline called People Express, which flew from 1981 to 1987: \u201cI started out as a first officer on the 737 and since I got hired at the very beginning, it was less than a year before I became a captain. I got to be one of the very first female airline captains in the world.\u201d Later, People Express started flying the Boeing 747s and in 1984, Rippelmeyer became the first woman to captain a jumbo on a transoceanic flight, from Newark to London Gatwick. \u201cBeautiful weather, lovely ride, nice landing. I walked through the cabin and people were congratulating me. There were all kinds of celebrations, TV, radio and photographers waiting for the arrival. Everybody was very, very gracious and wonderful about it. It was quite something,\u201d she says. Rippelmeyer briefly flew the Boeing 727 before People Express was acquired by Continental in 1987. The uncertainty that came with the merger caused her to take time off to go sailing through French Polynesia and then settle in California to marry and have children. After a hiatus of almost 10 years, a divorce and a move to Texas, she returned to the skies in 1998, finding ingenious ways to balance family and work life. \u201cMy two sons and I moved to Houston where Continental had a base. I returned to flying domestically on the 737 to be able to be home with my children more. The kids were only 3 and 7. Initially, I thought I needed to find a live-in nanny,\u201d she says. \u201cBut there was this one flight to Tegucigalpa, Honduras, that checked in at 9 a.m. and got back at 4 p.m. \u2014 so I would be able to drop the kids off at school, go to work and pick them back up. It was a difficult approach into the airport, which required extra training. It\u2019s a visual-only landing onto a short runway at a high altitude surrounded by mountains and has no electronic guidance. The chief pilot called me to ask why in the world I wanted to fly into the most dangerous airport we had. I told him it matched my kids\u2019 school schedule.\u201d \u201cSo that\u2019s what I flew for the better part of 12 years until the kids were old enough, and it worked out great. I could drop them off at school and get to the airport and fly to Central America - it\u2019s only two and a half hours from Houston. It was fun once you got used to it.\u201d Grounded Rippelmeyer\u2019s flights to Tegucigalpa also led to what she calls her \u201cretirement job\u201d \u2013 helping the people of Roatan, an island off the coast of Honduras. After meeting missionaries on board her flights, she began bringing in supplies donated by friends and family. She then created a nonprofit called ROSE (Roatan Support Effort) to support clinics, schools, community kitchens, sports programs and an animal shelter. Her last flight as a pilot took off in 2013 on a Boeing 787 with United Airlines, which had merged with Continental Airlines the previous year. \u201cMy first 747 flight was to London and then my last 787 flight was to London,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a perfect flight. The crew was fantastic. The layover was great. The weather in London was beautiful. And I thought, this is as good as it gets \u2013 and for the first time, I\u2019d rather be doing something else. My heart was in Honduras with the nonprofit. So, when I got back, I told the chief pilot that I wanted to retire.\u201d Rippelmeyer, who has written two memoirs \u2013 titled \u201cLife Takes Wings\u201d and \u201cLife Takes Flight\u201d \u2013 is nostalgic about the 747 and never quite warmed up to the more modern 787, which she calls \u201ca flying computer\u201d that is repaired with a laptop rather than a toolkit. \u201cIt\u2019s pieces of electronic equipment talking to other pieces of electronic equipment, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that,\u201d she says. \u201cIt usually works. It\u2019s much lighter in weight and uses less fuel, which is fantastic. Maybe I just never flew her long enough to be attached to her the way I was with the 747.\u201d She reckons that things have improved for women\u2019s careers in aviation: \u201cNow all women who want to be airline pilots have that opportunity. Aviation schools and airlines are accepting female applicants just as willingly as males. I don\u2019t see any discrimination against women any longer,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe if there is any left, it\u2019s because there are still some old schools of thoughts that say a woman should be home with her children. But I think that\u2019s gradually going to change.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/lynn-rippelmeyer-first-female-747-pilot/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_airplane-passenger-overhead-bin", "text": "Airplane overhead compartments. Home to luggage of all shapes and sizes, the odd coat or two, several duty-free bags, a fair bit of dust and\u2026 passengers? Last week, a video was posted on TikTok appearing to depict a traveler on a Southwest Airlines flight peering out from inside an overhead locker. The clip quickly spread across social media, although the original TikTok seems to have since been deleted. It\u2019s not the first time a video like this has hit the internet. In 2019, a flight attendant \u2013 also on a Southwest flight \u2013 was captured on film poking their head out of an overhead compartment. At the time, the airline released a statement saying the crew member was enjoying \u201ca brief moment of fun,\u201d before confirming \u201cthis is not our normal procedure.\u201d A Southwest representative told CNN Travel the airline was also \u201caware\u201d of last week\u2019s locker incident and is currently \u201clooking into it.\u201d Not a \u2018certifiable place for passengers\u2019 Given passengers are advised to stay in their seats for the duration of a plane journey \u2013 usually with their seatbelt fastened \u2013 it should go without saying that climbing into the overhead locker is a bad idea. As British flight attendant Kris Major tells CNN Travel, the overhead bin is \u201cnot a certifiable place to be as a passenger.\u201d \u201cIf we encountered turbulence they could get hurt \u2013 if they got blown out they could really get hurt and they could also hurt someone underneath them,\u201d says Major, adding that a passenger in an overhead bin also wouldn\u2019t have access to an oxygen mask in the event of an emergency. His words are echoed by Guido van Geenen, vice president of corporate communications for overhead bin supplier Diehl Aviation. Van Geenen tells CNN Travel that while the lockers are designed to accommodate \u201cquite a lot of weight\u201d that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re a safe place for passengers. \u201cClimbing in and out of an overhead bin may also be dangerous,\u201d adds van Geenen. In order to get into a locker, a person would have to clamber onto the back of the airplane seat, which could buckle under the weight. Van Geenen also makes the important point that \u201cbins do not have a way to open them from the inside\u201d \u2013 meaning if you\u2019re inside a locker and someone closes it from the outside \u201cyou have a problem.\u201d \u201cAll in all, we definitely do not recommend using the overhead bins for a nap,\u201d says van Geenen. \u201cThey are designed to safely hold the passengers\u2019 bags, but not made for a casual nap.\u201d Flight attendant\u2019s perspective Flight attendant Major\u2019s witnessed a lot in his 25 years of flying, but he\u2019s never actually seen a traveler inside the luggage bin. \u201cIf I saw a passenger trying to climb into an overhead locker, it would take me a few seconds to believe that was what was happening in front of me,\u201d he says. That said, Major admits he has \u201cseen photographs of crew in lockers\u201d and suggests it\u2019s the kind of thing that, while \u201cpretty frowned upon\u201d does happen from time to time when crew have the aircraft to themselves before boarding. While there\u2019s been a recent uptick in unruly passenger behavior on airplanes, Major says that if he encountered a passenger inside the locker, he wouldn\u2019t automatically assume they were being deliberately disruptive. His goal, first and foremost, would be to \u201cjust get them out\u201d and ensure they were safe. \u201cIt would depend on why they were up there as to my reaction,\u201d says Major. \u201cI would get them out, and then ascertain what was going on. I would assume that they were either under the influence of something, or mentally unwell.\u201d If a passenger spots another passenger inside an overhead locker, Major advises they notify a crew member, rather than intervene themselves \u2013 this same advice applies if passengers witness any untoward or unusual behavior on board. \u201cA passenger could inadvertently create a passenger disruption incident, because they could create conflict \u2013 whereas the crew are trained to de-escalate,\u201d Major says. Major also discourages passengers from filming and posting about an incident like this one. What might seem like a funny viral moment could have negative consequences, says Major, especially if the person in the video is already vulnerable. Future of overhead lockers While the airplane overhead locker is currently out of bounds for passengers, some as-yet-to-be-realized airplane cabin concepts reimagine this area as a space for travelers to stretch out and relax mid-flight. Take Toyota Boshoku\u2019s CLOUD CAPSULE concept, which envisages the area above the economy seat as an additional space for passengers to retreat to once the airplane reaches cruising altitude. In 2021, this design was nominated for a Crystal Cabin Award, a prestigious aviation design prize. While this concept might seem futuristic, the idea of passengers making use of the overhead locker space has some precedent. Way back in the 1950s, travelers who flew with Pan American Airways across the Atlantic on the Boeing 377 Stratocruiser were able to sleep in overhead compartments mid-flight. Major says flight attendants \u201calways look out for future developments,\u201d but he suggests crew are more focused on overhead lockers becoming bigger to accommodate more bags, rather than being adapted to accommodate passengers. \u201cHand luggage is one of the biggest issues facing flight attendants,\u201d says Major. \u201cIt causes problems if we can\u2019t get all those bags away or if we can\u2019t get passengers to put their bags away or if they\u2019re bringing too much on\u2026\u201d On most flights, overhead locker space is \u201cat a premium\u201d as Major puts it. Bins are so packed with travelers\u2019 bags and belongings that the idea of a person squeezing in there too is laughable. But Major is keen to stress that while the idea of someone climbing into the overhead locker might \u201cseem funny,\u201d it\u2019s important to remember an airplane cabin is a very specific environment and safety restrictions are there for a reason. \u201cYou\u2019re barrelling through the sky at 35,000 feet \u2013 500, 600 miles per hour,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to create an issue on board the aircraft, it\u2019s not the place to do it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/airplane-passenger-overhead-bin/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}

{"id": "travel_tourist-taxes-do-they-work", "text": "In April 2024, Venice began its controversial experiment to\u00a0charge day trippers\u00a0\u20ac5 ($5.40) to visit the city on some of the busiest days of the year. But it\u2019s not just the lagoon city, with its\u00a030 million visitors\u00a0a year, which is interested in trying out new tourism taxes. In the UK, a council in the county of Kent\u00a0has recommended\u00a0introducing a tourism tax on overnight stays in the county. In Scotland, it seems likely that\u00a0visitors to Edinburgh\u00a0will be paying a fee by 2026, and the Welsh government\u00a0plans to introduce\u00a0similar legislation later this year. There are more than 60 destinations around the world where this type of tax is already in place. These vary from a nationwide tax in Iceland to various towns across the US. Some have been in place for a long time (France was the\u00a0first in 1910), but most were introduced during the last decade or two. Before the pandemic really struck (and tourism was put on hold), 2020 was described by one newspaper as the\u00a0\u201cyear of the tourist tax,\u201d as Amsterdam joined an ever-growing list of destinations, which includes Paris, Malta and Cancun, to charge visitors for simply visiting. Introducing these tourist taxes has often been controversial, with industry bodies\u00a0voicing concerns\u00a0about the potential impacts on the tourist trade. And it appears that the link between such levies and visitor numbers is not simple, with several studies reaching different conclusions. For example, some have suggested that tourism levies have hindered\u00a0international tourism in the Balearics\u00a0and\u00a0the Maldives, and that they may dissuade people from participating in\u00a0domestic tourism. Yet in one of the world\u2019s most popular tourism spots with a levy, Barcelona, visitor numbers have\u00a0consistently risen, with hotel guests increasing from 7.1 million in 2013 to 9.5 million in 2019. In fact, the relationship between a visitor levy and tourist flow is so complex that there is no unified view, even within the same country. Italy has been one of the most studied, and results\u00a0are inconsistent\u00a0there too. Another study, looking at three neighbouring Italian seaside spots finds that only in one destination has the visitor levy\u00a0reduced tourist flow. And a study on the Italian cities of Rome, Florence and Padua shows that these cities\u00a0have not experienced any negative effects\u00a0either in terms of domestic or international demand. So the impact of tourism taxes on visitor numbers is inconclusive. But what about other effects, such as the potential benefits of spending the revenues raised? As part of an ongoing research project, we looked at seven different destinations in which tourist taxes are levied to look at how the money raised is then spent. For most places, tourism tax revenues were being used to fund marketing and branding \u2013 so invested directly into promoting more tourism. The income was also commonly used to fund tourism infrastructure, from public toilets and walking or cycling paths to a multi-billion dollar\u00a0convention centre\u00a0in Orange County, Florida. In\u00a0the Balearics, revenues tend to go to projects that mitigate the negative impacts of tourism on the environment, culture and society of the islands. These include waste management, conserving natural habitats and historical monuments, and social housing. But in general, tourism taxes have been implemented successfully across the destinations we looked at, and there is little evidence of tourists being put off from visiting. Research also suggests that when tourists are told what the levy is used for \u2013 and when it relates directly to\u00a0improving their experience\u00a0or\u00a0enhancing sustainable tourism\u00a0\u2013\u00a0tourists are willing to accept and pay\u00a0the levy. Day trippers For many tourism destinations, the major problem is not overnight tourists, but rather\u00a0day visitors\u00a0who use local resources while making little in the way of a financial contribution. For these reasons, taxes might also be used to deter day visits and instead encourage longer stays. Venice is at the forefront\u00a0of this shift. And in April 2024, after long discussions between the local authority, residents and business owners, Venice started a\u00a0trial\u00a0of a day visitor tax (a so-called\u00a0\u201caccess fee.\u201d) Back in Kent, it may take longer for any such radical plans to come to fruition. In contrast to Scotland and Wales, there are currently no national plans to\u00a0introduce tourist taxes\u00a0in England. This might be considered shortsighted, given the dire need of many destinations in England to improve local infrastructure that tourists rely on, including\u00a0clean bathing water\u00a0and\u00a0public transport. In\u00a0Manchester\u00a0and\u00a0Liverpool, businesses have implemented voluntary overnight charges on visitors, in the absence of the statutory basis to implement compulsory levies. Many other towns and cities will probably follow their lead. Tourism taxes are something we might all have to consider budgeting for in our future travel plans, wherever we choose to visit.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/tourist-taxes-do-they-work/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_ghost-tour-chance-encounters", "text": "Amelia Showalter was debating whether asking a stranger to join her on a ghost tour was a mad idea. She was sitting in a crowded bar in Edinburgh\u2019s Old Town, the last dregs of a glass of Scottish whisky in front of her. Also in front of her: Lucas Demaria. An Argentinian DJ she\u2019d just met. He was a fellow Edinburgh tourist and a self-confessed \u201cbig nerd.\u201d And he was someone Amelia was \u201cvery much liking talking with\u201d Amelia swallowed the last of her whisky, and in turn swallowed her reservations. She wanted to carry on her conversation with Lucas. And she was in a city she\u2019d never visited before. If he said no, it didn\u2019t matter. What did she have to lose? \u201cI\u2019m heading on this ghost tour soon,\u201d Amelia said. \u201cDo you want to come? It\u2019s supposed to be spooky.\u201d Lucas raised his eyebrow. \u201cNot that I actually believe in ghosts,\u201d Amelia added quickly. \u201cSure,\u201d said Lucas, laughing. \u201cWhy not.\u201d The next thing they knew, Amelia and Lucas were walking, shoulder to shoulder, down Edinburgh\u2019s cobbled streets. Dusk was falling and the city, with its stone spired buildings and hills and crags in the distance, had a dreamy atmosphere. The ghost tour focused on the city\u2019s bloody history, with the guide recounting the chilling tale of grave robbers Burke and Hare, stories of plague and taking the group into Edinburgh\u2019s eerie Blair Street underground vaults, a series of abandoned chambers beneath the city\u2019s South Bridge. \u201cYou\u2019d think it wouldn\u2019t be very romantic,\u201d Amelia tells CNN Travel today. \u201cBut it was, because you\u2019re kind of pretending to be scared.\u201d Amelia and Lucas stood closer and closer as the tour progressed. Their hands brushed against each other, but didn\u2019t quite touch. And then, tour over, the two ducked into a bar. They sat together, drinking and chatting into the night. \u201cAnd at some point I was like, \u2018We should make out,\u2019\u201d says Amelia. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Yes,\u2019\u201d says Lucas, laughing. \u201cI feel like at that point we were both like, \u2018Come on, we\u2019re going to kiss,\u2019\u201d says Amelia. \u201cIt was going that way for sure,\u201d says Lucas. One day in Edinburgh Amelia and Lucas went on the spontaneous ghost tour on June 4, 2018, which just so happened to be Amelia\u2019s 35th birthday. Back then, Amelia lived and worked in Washington D.C., running a political data consultancy. She\u2019d previously worked on President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign in 2012. From time to time, Amelia\u2019s work led to interesting travel opportunities \u2013 and that\u2019s how she ended up visiting the UK in June 2018. She got invited to speak at a conference in London, and decided to tack on some extra days exploring the UK. \u201cI was like, \u2018Well, if I\u2019m going to be sort of traveling on my own, when I turn 35, I should do something fun \u2013 I should go celebrate somehow,\u2019\u201d says Amelia. Amelia decided to attend a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d convention in Manchester in the north of England (\u201cI love sci-fi, fantasy, all that stuff,\u201d she says). Then she headed up to Scotland to squeeze in a day of solo travel in Edinburgh. \u201cI just had the one day there,\u201d recalls Amelia. \u201cSo I went to the National Museum of Scotland. I ate some haggis. And then I wanted to have some Scotch.\u201d Amelia figured it would be fitting to sample a 35-year-old Scottish whisky on the day of her 35th birthday. She Googled Edinburgh\u2019s best whisky bars and the internet suggested Edinburgh institution Bow Bar, situated on the city\u2019s colorful, winding Victoria Street. Amelia headed in that direction, pushed open the blue door and grabbed a seat at the bar. She\u2019d just started sipping her drink when she spotted Lucas. He caught her eye because he was \u2013 unlike almost everyone else inside Bow Bar\u2013 drinking a beer. \u201cI just thought it was so strange that this person was drinking a beer in a whisky bar,\u201d says Amelia. \u201cI really wanted to know, \u2018What beer is so good that you\u2019re doing that instead of drinking some whisky?\u2019\u201d Without really thinking twice, Amelia turned to the stranger and asked the question. Connecting over whisky In June 2018, Lucas Demaria was 36 and starting to \u201cgive up on trying to find the one,\u201d as he puts it. Disillusioned with romance, Lucas decided to focus on exploring the world. \u201cI started traveling late in my life,\u201d Lucas tells CNN Travel. \u201cAnd it just blew my mind.\u201d He arrived in Edinburgh for the first time on the morning of June 4, 2018. He\u2019d heard the city was scenic, but he couldn\u2019t quite believe how spectacular it really was. \u201cI made it there and was like, \u2018Oh my God, this is a beautiful city,\u2019\u201d recalls Lucas. \u201cI had in my mind eating haggis, so I dropped the bag in the hostel, started walking, ate haggis, and then I told myself, \u2018Okay, I need to drink some scotch\u2019 But I\u2019m very into beer. And I know really nothing about scotch.\u201d Lucas stumbled across the Bow Bar while wandering around on foot. It looked like the place to go to satisfy his whisky quest. But once inside, the range of options was pretty intimidating. Lucas stared at the bottles, mystified. In the end he ordered a beer to enjoy while he mulled over the whisky options. When Amelia struck up conversation, questioning his drink choice, Lucas told her a truncated version of this explanation. He\u2019d actually been debating how to strike up conversation with Amelia before she got in there first \u2013 he\u2019d noticed her almost right away: \u201cSitting at the end of the bar, a beautiful lady,\u201d as he recalls it. Drink orders explained, the conversation moved on. Lucas was wearing a \u201cStar Wars\u201d T-shirt, and Amelia commented on it, saying she was also a fan. \u201cI showed her my \u2018Star Wars\u2019 tattoos,\u201d says Lucas. At the time, Amelia was into cosplay \u2013 recreating and wearing the costumes of fictional characters. So after she\u2019d admired the tattoos, she got out her phone, and showed Lucas some photos of her hand-sewn \u201cStar Wars\u201d costumes. \u201cIt was a nerd meeting,\u201d says Lucas, laughing. From there, the two talked a bit about their impressions of the UK, realizing along the way that they shared the same favorite British band: The Beatles. The conversation flowed in a way that surprised them both \u2013 neither Lucas or Amelia usually spoke to strangers in bars. \u201cIt\u2019s not in my nature,\u201d says Lucas. \u201cBut I would do that while traveling.\u201d \u201cYeah, I would never just go start talking to a random person in a bar in D.C., which is where I lived at the time,\u201d agrees Amelia. \u201cBut when I travel, I\u2019m just a much more open-minded person.\u201d It was this outlook that prompted Amelia to invite Lucas to join her on the ghost tour \u2013 and prompted Lucas to say yes. After the evening of whisky drinking, ghost stories and growing closer, Amelia and Lucas had to say their goodbyes. Amelia was heading down to London for her conference, while Lucas still had a few more days exploring Edinburgh. The two exchanged contact details, and started communicating via messaging app WhatsApp. \u201cFirst it was just text, for a couple of weeks, with some photos,\u201d recalls Amelia. And then, one day when she was back home in Washington D.C., Amelia saw a voice recording from Lucas pop up on her phone. Voice notes are pretty commonplace in the US now, but in 2018, Amelia had never come across the concept. In contrast, Lucas regularly sent voice notes to his friends in Argentina. Amelia clicked play, and Lucas\u2019 voice echoed around her bedroom. Her heart started racing. \u201cTo hear his voice and everything, I was just so excited,\u201d she recalls. \u201cAnd it made me realize, \u2018Oh, I really like this guy.\u2019 Because when I was hearing his voice again, it was just so wonderful.\u201d Before long, Amelia and Lucas were video calling regularly. \u201cWe\u2019d be talking for an hour, a couple of hours,\u201d recalls Amelia. \u201cSeveral times a week,\u201d says Lucas. Statistics of love Amelia\u2019s a data scientist by trade, and even while caught up in the heady emotions of falling for Lucas, she tried to think things through logically. \u201cWhen we met, I started making a little spreadsheet of how certain I felt that he was the love of my life,\u201d recalls Amelia. \u201cI wasn\u2019t being overly romantic \u2013 the first entry was 10% \u2013 a 10% chance Lucas was the love of my life. Which is actually really high if you think about it, just because what are the odds that any person is the love of your life?\u201d As she spent more and more time WhatsApping Lucas, Amelia added more data to the spreadsheet. \u201cIt went up to 20%,\u201d she says. \u201cI kept plotting it out.\u201d But Amelia knew the only way of securing a higher score would be to see Lucas again. The prospect had been raised on their video calls \u2013 but they had to figure out the logistics. Lucas\u2019 DJ job was always busier during his Argentinian summer months, starting November through to January. If he was going to embark on another vacation, it needed to be before then. Amelia considered visiting Lucas, and Lucas debated visiting Amelia, but ultimately the two decided meeting in a third country was the best plan. \u201cSo in October of 2018, we scheduled a 10-day trip to Peru together,\u201d recalls Amelia. \u201cOur second date.\u201d On their respective flights to Peru, Amelia and Lucas played back their months of video conversations in their head. They were both excited, but also apprehensive. \u201cI think my biggest fear, going to Peru, was, \u2018What if I get there, and all of a sudden, it just feels wrong? Like I\u2019ve built this whole thing up in my head,\u2019\u201d recalls Amelia. \u201cBecause you can kind of do that with long distance.\u201d But as soon as Amelia saw Lucas, her fears dissolved. \u201cImmediately, I was like, \u2018Oh, no, this is great,\u2019\u201d Amelia says. \u201cWithin the first two days, when we were walking around Lima, it was like, \u2018This feels really serious.\u2019 And it felt good.\u201d In between hiking the Inca Trail, marveling at Machu Picchu and eating mountains of delicious Peruvian food, Amelia and Lucas started talking about marriage. \u201cBy the end of the trip, we were not exactly engaged. But we were sort of engaged to be engaged,\u201d says Amelia. She updated her spreadsheet: the percentage was steadily climbing. The idea of marrying someone you\u2019d only met twice seemed bizarre, but both Amelia and Lucas felt calm and excited when they considered their future together \u2013 with just a dash of surprise at the whole thing. After all, their lives were taking a direction neither of them had anticipated \u2013 it was a happy shift, but a shift all the same. \u201cI never thought about getting married either until I met her, basically,\u201d says Lucas. Amelia echoes this. \u201cI had really gotten fine with the idea of being single,\u201d she says. \u201cI was like, \u2018Well, maybe I\u2019m just going to be one of those people that doesn\u2019t meet anybody. And that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m just going to have a life on my own.\u2019\u201d The future suddenly looked very different for both of them. In February 2019, Lucas came to D.C. to visit Amelia. He met her parents, friends and loved ones. Not long after, Amelia visited Lucas in Argentina. It was during that trip that the couple officially got engaged. They picked out the ring together, making official something both of them knew was on the cards from pretty much day one. Explaining this feeling to loved ones was sometimes a little \u201cstrange,\u201d says Amelia. She recalls saying: \u201cI met this guy in Scotland, but he\u2019s from Argentina. And I think we might get married\u201d and fielding disbelieving responses, and some concerns. \u201cIt was just definitely a strange thing to explain to people,\u201d Amelia reflects today. \u201cBut I think also, it\u2019s such a different thing when you\u2019re in your 30s \u2013 because you know yourself better. I think it would be ill advised to do that when you\u2019re 20, because you don\u2019t really know yourself and it\u2019s easy to get kind of caught up. But I think after 15, 20 years of dating, you know yourself \u2013 and you have had enough other relationships to know what doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Getting married Amelia and Lucas were married at a small courthouse ceremony in Washington D.C. in the summer of 2019. Then, four months later, the couple threw a big D.C. celebration for family and friends. As a DJ, Lucas had worked hundreds of weddings. He\u2019d seen stuff he liked, stuff he didn\u2019t like \u2013 and all in all, knew what added up to a great evening. Amelia was on the same page. The couple wanted the evening to feel like, \u201ca night at the bar with all your friends,\u201d as Amelia puts it. Amelia and Lucas rented a cafe-bar called Emissary in D.C. for the evening. \u201cWe had endless appetizers,\u201d recalls Amelia. \u201cSo there wasn\u2019t a sit down dinner. It was just food whenever you want, open bar, with all the usual stuff that\u2019s on the menu, and espresso when you want because it was also a cafe.\u201d Lucas mixed the music in advance, while Amelia made her own wedding dress using the sewing skills she\u2019d perfected from her years of cosplay. And when she was planning her speech and considering what to say, Amelia dug out the spreadsheets she\u2019d compiled when she first met Lucas. \u201cI printed signs with the graphs I made,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone thought it was very funny.\u201d Meanwhile Lucas\u2019 best friend from Argentina made a speech in which he recounted the moment Lucas first told him he\u2019d met Amelia \u2013 and how he\u2019d known she was someone special based on the excited, heartfelt tone of Lucas\u2019 voice. The wedding also nodded to Amelia and Lucas\u2019 first conversation in Bow Bar about their shared love of \u201cStar Wars.\u201d Midway through their first dance \u2013 to The Beatles\u2019 \u201cIn My Life\u201d \u2013 the couple interrupted proceedings to have a mini lightsaber battle. \u201cSecretly, we had hidden some lightsabers with a couple of our friends,\u201d explains Amelia, laughing. \u201cSo halfway through the dance. We did a little lightsaber action, little tiny dance fight, and then back to dancing.\u201d \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t think that lightsabers would work with the Beatles in my life. When I say it out loud, it sounds like a really weird combination, but it was really fun.\u201d A month or so later, Lucas and Amelia relocated from D.C. to Seattle, Washington, where Amelia had grown up and where her parents still lived. She was ready to leave the US capital, and figured if she and Lucas might have a kid, it\u2019d be nice to be closer to family. As for Lucas, serendipitously, Seattle happened to be a perfect fit. He loved grunge music (\u201cI was a kid in the \u201890s,\u201d he shrugs), IPA beers and black coffee. He was instantly \u201cso happy\u201d there. Life in Seattle Cut to today and Lucas and Amelia still live in Seattle. Lucas set up his own successful Seattle-based DJ business, while Amelia\u2019s still working in political data analysis. The couple are also kept busy by their three-year-old son Jude. He\u2019s named \u2013 of course \u2013 for The Beatles song, \u201cHey Jude.\u201d The name seemed appropriate, given Lucas and Amelia both love The Beatles and talked about the band that first night in Edinburgh. \u201cIt\u2019s so funny because those things \u2013 the fact that we both love \u2018Star Wars\u2019 and The Beatles \u2013 it mattered a lot at the beginning because it was like, \u2018Oh, we have these things in common,\u2019\u201d reflects Amelia. \u201cAnd now I don\u2019t think about them so much, because we just have a whole life together.\u201d \u201cI think shared values are, in the end, way more important than a shared taste for movies,\u201d agrees Lucas. It\u2019s their similar\u00a0 approach to life, Lucas suggests, that\u2019s led him and Amelia to the happiness they continue to enjoy today. Plus, while they still enjoy watching the same TV and movies, Amelia and Lucas\u2019 tastes do occasionally diverge. Amelia loves a Broadway musical, for example, which isn\u2019t Lucas\u2019 vibe. Meanwhile Amelia\u2019s never quite got her head around Lucas\u2019 passion for heavy metal. The pandemic, and then the birth of Jude, put a pause on Lucas and Amelia\u2019s desire to travel the world together post-wedding. But in 2023, the couple embarked on a long-awaited \u201camazing\u201d Honeymoon to Japan, leaving Jude in the care of his grandparents. Also on the travel agenda is one day returning to Edinburgh, this time with Jude in tow. Amelia and Lucas want to show their son where they met, and retrace the steps of their first evening together. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take Jude to the bar,\u201d says Lucas. \u201cPut him on the bar,\u201d adds Amelia, laughing. \u201cAnd say, \u2018This is your fault.\u2019\u201d \u201cFree drinks for us,\u201d jokes Lucas. In reality, they\u2019ll probably hold off on returning to Edinburgh until Jude\u2019s old enough to enjoy the trip in his own right. \u201cMaybe on our 10 year anniversary, or something,\u201d says Amelia. \u201cThere\u2019s so much of Scotland I\u2019ve never seen, so we definitely want to go back there someday.\u201d Something Lucas and Amelia still marvel at is the idea that they\u2019re so compatible, despite the fact they grew up thousands of miles from each other \u2013 and only happened to be in the same bar, in the same city, in the same country by happenstance. \u201cIt\u2019s so weird, he\u2019s just a random guy in a bar,\u201d says Amelia. \u201cFrom a different country,\u201d adds Lucas. Neither are who the other envisaged when they imagined a prospective life partner. Lucas \u2013 who recalls breaking up with an ex who lived 15 minutes away from him because he felt like they were from \u201cdifferent worlds\u201d \u2013 finds it incongruous yet incredible that he ended up marrying someone he met on vacation. As for Amelia, she always figured she\u2019d end up with a fellow Ivy League graduate, who also worked in the D.C. politics world. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like, \u2018Oh I must be with that kind of person,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cBut you just get an idea of, \u2018This is probably who I will end up with.\u2019 I never would have assumed it would be a DJ from Argentina.\u201d All this suggests, says Amelia and Lucas, that compatibility has little to do with shared backgrounds. It goes back to that shared values thing and being on the same wavelength, they say \u2013 and the idea of being open, of willingly embarking on adventures. \u201cI mean, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to absolutely find the love of your life from traveling,\u201d says Lucas. \u201cYou could find the love of one night, and that can be fun too,\u201d says Amelia. Amelia and Lucas are also grateful that their relationship continues to develop as they grow together. \u201cWe were in love,\u201d says Lucas of their 2018 selves. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t know each other 100% as we do know.\u201d \u201cI always felt certain about you,\u201d says Amelia to Lucas. \u201cBut I\u2019m more in love with you all the time. It\u2019s wonderful.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/ghost-tour-chance-encounters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_disneyland-expansion-rezoning-approval", "text": "Disney cleared a major hurdle to start developing a colossal expansion of its Disneyland theme parks on Tuesday night when the Anaheim city council unanimously gave final approval to rezone much of the property. Disney\u2019s original resort in California, which comprises a shopping district, parking areas and two theme parks, is about 550 acres, which is less than 2% of the size of Walt Disney World in Florida. But with newly approved \u201cmulti-use\u201d zoning, Disney can now expand its theme parks in Anaheim without acquiring any new land, by building attractions where the company could previously only build hotels or parking lots.\u00a0This paves the way for a multi-decade project to expand both of its theme parks there: Disneyland and Disney California Adventure. \u201cFor nearly seven decades, Disneyland Resort has made a unique, irreplaceable impact on hundreds of millions of guests from around the world. How exciting to know our best days are still ahead \u2013 I can\u2019t wait to show you what\u2019s to come,\u201d Disneyland Resort President Ken Potrock said in a statement Tuesday night. The project, dubbed \u201cDisneylandForward,\u201d does not require any public funding. While no specific designs have been shared yet, Disney has released concept art for what the expansion could look like on the west side of the resort, in areas surrounding Disneyland Hotel and Pixar Place Hotel. \u201cThis is long overdue \u2013 this is decades overdue. This, in my opinion, is the biggest thing Disney has done since they opened the gate in \u201955,\u201d said Dennis Speigel, owner and founder of International Theme Park Services, a global consultant for theme park projects. Speigel, who is not involved in Disney\u2019s plans, said this project could allow Disneyland Resort to go from an estimated 25 million visits per year to 40 million over the next 20 years. \u201cYou\u2019re going from a two-room house to a five-room house,\u201d Speigel said, adding that visitors will be much more comfortable in the expanded space and increase per capita spending by staying longer to experience more attractions. What will the new areas look like? Disney CEO Bob Iger said during a shareholders\u2019 meeting in April that DisneylandForward\u2019s potential new projects could include \u201cthe opportunity to embark on all-new Avatar adventures with a visit to the world of Pandora.\u201d The released concept art for a possible Avatar land shows a space similar to Pandora in Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom in Florida, but with guests on boats in the middle of an open lake, a look evoking the franchise\u2019s second film, \u201cThe Way of Water.\u201d In a video posted by Disney in January, Rachel Alde, Disney Experiences senior VP of global development, said a 1990s agreement with the city of Anaheim permitted Disney to build 6.8 million square feet of theme park space, but the company has only built 46% of that due to restrictions in space and zoning. \u201cJust imagine what we could do with this space. Right now, it\u2019s surface parking lots. But what if we could become the first-ever land based on Wakanda, from the Black Panther franchise? A land based on Zootopia leveraging the work you saw earlier at Shanghai Disney Resort. The creation of Arendelle from Frozen, similar to what you saw at three of our international parks. Or even the opportunity to celebrate Dia de los Muertos, in a Coco-themed land resonating with the diverse community in Southern California.\u201d \u2018Disneyland will never be completed\u2019 Don Ballard, an author and historian who wrote a book on the historic Disneyland Hotel, said the company\u2019s original resort is \u201cever evolving. I mean, you know, the technology changes, people\u2019s tastes change.\u201d Ballard brought up a famous quote by Walt Disney: \u201cDisneyland will never be completed. It will continue to grow as long as there is imagination left in the world.\u201d Todd James Pierce, a Cal Poly San Luis Obispo professor who wrote the book \u201cThree Years in Wonderland\u201d on the making of Disneyland, said, \u201cWhen Walt was alive, almost every year there was a new attraction, if not multiple new attractions. The one break is right around the World\u2019s Fair, because he was busy doing other things. But this gives the Disneyland Resort the land to really expand in that way \u2026 So if people are fans, there\u2019s going to be something new not too long from now, every year, every couple of years.\u201d Pierce said that what\u2019s interesting about the concept art they\u2019ve chosen is \u201cnone of these things are standalone attractions. They\u2019re all 8- to 12-acre themed environments, usually around one or related [stories],\u201d like an entire Frozen land. Ballard and Pierce both believe that beyond creating something imaginative, the new project is also practical in relieving crowds in the compact resort. Ballard, who proposed to his wife at Disneyland, joked, \u201cIt was just me and 80,000 of my closest friends. And I asked her to marry me in front of the castle, and four girls behind her said \u2018yes.\u2019\u201d Pierce said that by having new lands open, Disney can also more easily close existing attractions to redevelop them, because guests can spread out and not be forced into tight crowds. How to keep it in the \u2018bubble\u2019 Disney theme parks around the world are known for creating an immersive atmosphere, where a visitor leaves the \u201creal\u201d world for something fantastical. To do so requires a \u201cDisney bubble,\u201d as fans call it, where one is shielded from the outside world. But there will be a challenge with this project because part of the land that could be redeveloped is separate from the main Disneyland Resort campus. Disney has shown in concept art that one piece of land on the east side, which is currently the Toy Story surface parking lot, could be turned into a mixed-use hotel, restaurant and shopping district similar to Disney Springs in Florida. To get from the main theme parks to this shopping area requires crossing city streets with 7-Elevens and CVS drugstores, Pierce said. The challenge is \u201cnot in doing what they do really well, which is build themed environments, but figuring out how to connect up this patchwork of property that they\u2019ll now control,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cElevated walkways, a people mover system or a Skyliner system (the elevated gondolas), something like that\u2026is probably going to be necessary, otherwise the vacation experience becomes fragmented.\u201d The DisneylandForward project includes approval for pedestrian bridges over city streets, but anything else would require separate city approval, according to Mike Lyster, chief communications officer for the city of Anaheim. Another concern is making sure there\u2019s enough parking. By potentially building theme park lands on top of what are currently parking lots, Disney would need to create new parking accommodations elsewhere around the resort. Disney has said it envisions building a new parking location on the east side of the resort, which would include one to three pedestrian bridges with upgraded entrance accessibility for hotels and businesses along Harbor Boulevard. A 40-year promise Tuesday\u2019s rezoning approval will go into effect in 30 days. Next,\u00a0Disney and the city of Anaheim will\u00a0finalize\u00a0a development agreement that would be good until 2064. \u201cThis is a milestone for the city. We\u2019re looking at a unique opportunity not just for Anaheim, but for the state of California,\u201d said Ashleigh Aitken, the mayor of Anaheim. The agreement, which is likely to be finalized in the coming week,\u00a0includes\u00a0Disney committing $1.9 billion to the project in the first 10 years, paying $40 million to take over two streets currently owned by the city, paying $45 million for transportation improvements, contributing $8 million for city parks, and contributing $30 million for affordable housing. Speigel said he believes the company will exceed the initial investment promise and spend more than $3 billion. This\u00a0expansion project\u00a0comes as the company had previously announced a $60 billion investment in its parks and cruises around the world over the next 10 years. Aitken said more than 50% of the city of Anaheim\u2019s general fund comes from dollars generated in the tourism industry. So not only would the project transform the guest experience, it would also result in a major investment in the city. She also said she has been one of the \u201cfiercest critics\u201d of expansion in the resort district, opposing city subsidies and ensuring the project\u2019s support from construction and hospitality unions. \u201cAnd I\u2019m comfortable that the Disneyland team has answered a lot of those concerns.\u201d Aitken said the resulting proposal is well thought-out and a \u201cwin-win\u201d for everyone.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/disneyland-expansion-rezoning-approval/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}

{"id": "travel_vietage-luxury-train-vietnam-anantara-intl-hnk", "text": "There\u2019s nothing quite like settling back into your train seat, the urban skyline out the window fading into lush natural landscapes as you make your way to your next destination. According to rail experts, an increasing number of luxury travelers are looking to experience this sensation, all part of a global shift towards slower and more sustainable tourism activities. Anantara is among the hospitality giants now tapping into this demand, with the high-end hotel brand offering a new five-hour luxury train experience in southern Vietnam that connects the popular resort destinations of Na Trang and Quy Nhon \u2013 its second route in the country. The first \u201cThe Vietage by Anantara\u201d luxury train carriage launched in 2020 \u2013 a six-hour journey connecting Da Nang and Quy Nhon. Ananatara\u2019s head of PR and marketing for Vietnam, Kate Jones tells CNN the new carriage heads in the opposite direction and aims to expose travelers to even more of Vietnam\u2019s beautiful views. Like the first Vietage carriage, it will be attached to Vietnam\u2019s state-run commercial railway that runs up and down the country. \u201cThe main difference is that the new route connecting Nha Trang and Quy Nhon passes through many more coastal areas than the journey between Da Nang and Quy Nhon,\u201d says Jones. \u201cThere is a selection of really quite stunning bays and some striking coastline facing the East Sea. There are some mountainous areas and still plenty of rice paddies and lotus ponds, but the coastal scenery is the biggest view \u2018pull\u2019 for this five-hour journey.\u201d This is slow travel at its best \u2013 the trains hit an average speed of 51.9 kilometers per hour (32.2 mph) according to Anantara. That gives guests on the Quy Nhon-Nha Trang route plenty of time to enjoy their complimentary afternoon tea set, which includes local caviar, Vietnamese artisanal cheeses, a selection of cold cuts and premium Vietnamese teas. For the six-hour journeys between Da Nang and Quy Nhon, passengers are served a pre-ordered three-course gourmet meal. Guests on either route also get complimentary snacks, free-flow wine, cocktails, mocktails, teas, coffee and soft drinks, plus a 15-minute head and shoulder treatment. The Vietage carriage is fitted out with a sit-up bar, restroom facilities and six private booths that seat two, each of which comes with power outlets, charging stations, free wifi and amenity baskets with pillows, blankets and other essentials. Travelers can reserve their seats online at Thevietagetrain.com, while those wanting to combine their rail journeys with a stay at one of Anantara\u2019s properties \u2013 \u2013 Anantara Hoi An Resort, Anantara Quy Nhon Villas or Avani Quy Nhon Resort \u2013 can book packages through those individual hotel websites. The cost of a one-way Vietage journey is $420 per person. The new route departs from Nha Trang Train Station at 2 p.m., arriving at Dieu Tri Station in Quy Nhon at 6:29 p.m. For those preferring to travel in the opposite direction, trains depart Dieu Tri Train Station at 2:15 p.m. - arriving at Nha Trang Train Station at 6:36 p.m. The original route departs from Da Nang Train Station at 8 a.m., arriving at Quy Nhon\u2019s Dieu Tri Station at 2:03 p.m. There is also an evening option that departs Quy Nhon at 7:00 p.m., arriving in Da Nang at 12:53 a.m. the following day. This Vietage journey is slightly cheaper, costing $315 per passenger. As for demand, Jones says many are turning to rail travel rather than \u201crushing through airports to get from A to B.\u201d \u201cThe domestic aviation industry in Vietnam right now is also facing some challenges with the disappearance of two airlines and a reduced fleet with the national carrier, so overall air travel is currently not popular, plus overly expensive,\u201d she says. \u201cThe Vietage is the only experience of its kind in Vietnam and, of course, with the return of the Belmond train, the awareness of luxury rail travel is growing in Southeast Asia.\u201d In addition to traveling slowly and more sustainably, Jones says rail travelers gain real visual insights into the country, taking in scenes like \u201crural villages, fishermen casting their nets, farmers in fields with the water buffaloes \u2013 things you definitely don\u2019t experience at 35,000 feet.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/vietage-luxury-train-vietnam-anantara-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_article_dumplings-worlds-best", "text": "How to define a dumpling? In its most basic sense, it\u2019s a pocket of dough filled with some form of savory or sweet stuffing.  And the easy ideas are surely the best, because dumplings are a popular food across the globe: both simple and complex, local and global, adaptable yet fixed in their home regions as cheap, tasty staples to snack on.     Here are no fewer than 35 of our favorites around the world to get your taste buds flowing. Xiaolongbao     Served steamed in bamboo baskets, xiaolongbao look different from other types of Chinese dumplings, as the skin is gathered and pinched at the top instead of folded in half.  Xiaolongbao are also unique in that aside from the traditional pork filling, a small piece of aspic is folded into the dumpling, which melts when steamed. Thanks to the broth, the filling stays moist and flavorful.   Ravioli   Italy is, of course, the global home of filled pasta, and ravioli is one of its most famous offerings \u2013 so famous that it has been exported across the world.  Ravioli \u2013 as well as other Italian filled pastas \u2013 can be packed with anything from meat to cheese to vegetables, or any combination thereof.   If the processed canned or bagged varieties familiar to lazy college students makes up your only impression of ravioli, rectify that as soon as possible. Preferably with a trip to Rome.   Sichuan spicy wonton    The spicy Sichuan wonton, or chao shou, comes to the table drenched in a spicy chili oil flavored with Sichuan peppercorn and a black vinegar sauce. The chao shou is boiled and the very best specimens are so slippery they\u2019re nearly impossible to pick up with chopsticks.  The combination of savory meat, smooth wonton skin and tongue-numbing sauce, makes for the most pleasant runny nose you\u2019ve ever had.  Manti   Manti hail from Central Asia \u2013 they\u2019re eaten in places such as Turkey, northwestern China, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan \u2013 and are very closely related to East Asian variants of dumplings.   Adopted by Turks who traveled across Central Asia during the Mongol Empire, these dumplings can be filled with lamb, beef, quail or chicken \u2013 or be left unfilled. Turkish manti are served with yogurt and spiced with red pepper and melted butter.   Bryndzov\u00e9 halu\u0161ky    A national dish in Slovakia, bryndzov\u00e9 halu\u0161ky is a dish of potato dumplings served with bryndza, a Slovakian sheep\u2019s cheese, and sprinkled with bacon or pork fat.  Siomay     A steamed fish dumpling served with vegetables and peanut sauce, think of siomay as the Indonesian street food equivalent of shumai, traditionally found in Cantonese dim sum restaurants. Adopted from Chinese Indonesian cuisine, the most popular variant of siomay is found in Bandung. The best way to sample these dumplings is from a street vendor carting a steamer on his bicycle.   Shrimp wonton   The Hong Kong-style shrimp wonton is a thick dumpling holding shrimp and minced pork. It\u2019s commonly served with thin egg noodles or on its own in a seafood broth.  Many a heated debate over the best shrimp wonton has been heard locally, but there\u2019s never any arguing over its prime place in the Hong Kong diet.  Pierogi   Originating in Central and Eastern Europe, pierogi are most commonly thought of as Polish.  These dumplings can be stuffed with potato, minced meat, cheese, fruit or sauerkraut. They\u2019re usually boiled, then pan-fried in butter with onions. This finishing flourish is the selling point of the dish, adding another layer of flavor.  Modak    Modak is a sweet from Maharashtra, offered to Lord Ganesha during Ganesh Chathurthi, the festival dedicated to him every year between August and September.  The teardrop-shaped dumpling is kneaded from rice flour and stuffed with coconut and jaggery \u2013 an unrefined whole cane sugar.  Dushbara    These Azerbaijani dumplings are filled with lamb or beef, and usually served in broth.  Rather like the most fiddly of Italian pasta dumplings, they\u2019re folded by hand, a process made more difficult by their small size. Vinegar and garlic sauce tops it off with an extra kick.  Kartoffelknoedel  Found across Germany, kartoffelknoedel, or potato dumplings, usually accompany meat dishes. The Bavarian variant combines both raw and cooked potato, stuffed with a crouton or bread filling.   Coxinha   This is a popular street food in Brazil: effectively chicken dumplings, made from fried dough with shredded chicken in the middle.  They\u2019re shaped in the form of a teardrop, supposedly to resemble a chicken thigh \u2013 the dish was originally made from thigh meat. Some add potato to the dough before frying, for an extra carby oomph.   Pelmeni    Pelmeni are Russian dumplings from Siberia, likely introduced to Russian cuisine by the Mongols. Similar to Chinese jiaozi, Turkish manti and eastern European pierogi, pelmeni are distinguished by the thickness of the dumpling skin. Pelmeni may be stuffed with anything from meat to mushrooms to cheese, but never with anything sweet.   Dim sim   Some dumpling purists say that the Australian dim sim is merely a bastardized version of Chinese dumplings. But we say, if a dumpling has fans standing in line, it\u2019s a worthy dumpling. Dim sim is a combination of meat or fish mixed with cabbage and enclosed in a wrapper. It may be steamed, deep-fried or barbecued, and is usually much larger than a Chinese dumpling. Dim sims usually taste gingery \u2013 a feature of westernized Chinese cuisine found in Australia, North America and Europe.  Brik   The word \u201cbrik\u201d is thought to derive from Turkish, but this is a thoroughly Tunisian dumpling, a deep-fried triangle of deliciousness, often with an egg popped inside for extra gooey flavor. It can be filled with tuna, harissa and parsley, or anything from capers to cheese and meat. Banh bot loc    Banh bot loc are Vietnamese pork and shrimp dumplings, with wrappers made from tapioca flour. When cooked, tapioca flour becomes clear, giving the dumpling its appearance and the wrapper its chewy texture. There are two major variants: wrapped in banana leaves and steamed, or boiled.  Empanada  If you\u2019ve ever been to Argentina (or neighboring Latin American countries) you\u2019ll almost certainly have eaten an empanada: pastry stuffed with meat, fish or other fillings, then baked or fried.  In Argentina, the traditional fillings depend on where you are \u2013 olives are often worked into the filling in Mendoza, for example. Usually, though, you\u2019ll have a choice of meat \u2013 chicken and beef are classics.  Tangyuan  Tangyuan is a Chinese dessert \u2013 sticky balls made from glutinous rice flour containing a sweet filling, such as ground peanuts or black sesame paste, and served in a bowl of sweet soup or rolled in ground peanuts.  Some tangyuan are served as smaller, unfilled rice balls in a soup made from cane sugar. In dessert shop chains all over Hong Kong, tangyuan are served with ice cream, topped with a drizzle of syrup.  Chicken and dumplings  Chicken and dumplings is probably the ultimate in Southern comfort food in the United States. Chicken soup is a dish found all over the world, but the addition of dumplings gives the soup an extra something. American dumplings are usually a mix of flour, vegetable shortening and milk \u2013 in this case, dropped directly into the chicken broth. The broth may be a clear chicken soup, or thickened with flour or cream.   Kimchi mandu    Mandu, the Korean take on dumplings, are more closely related to manti found in Central Asian cuisine than to Chinese or Japanese dumplings. Mandu are often folded into circular shapes, a technique rarely found in Chinese cuisine.  As ubiquitous as kimchi is in Korea, it was probably inevitable that somewhere along the way someone would chop up kimchi and stick it in a dumpling.  Canederli  When winter nights are closing in and the temperatures are dropping, what could be better than a golf ball-sized dumpling made from bread, stuffed with things like speck (a type of cured ham), cheese and onion, washed down with a tanker of beer?  Italians flock to Alto Adige, the autonomous region in the north of the country, which was part of Austrian Tyrol until being annexed to Italy under Fascism, for these traditional Tyrolean dumplings. Eat them in broth, or order a plateful (some restaurants do canederli \u201cflights\u201d of different fillings). Just be warned \u2013 these are huge, and you\u2019ll likely find your eyes are far bigger than your stomach.  Bawan  Bawan is a Taiwanese street snack commonly found in night markets around the island. A translucent wrapper made from rice flour, corn starch and sweet potato starch holds a stuffing of pork, bamboo shoots and mushrooms. Bawan is served with a sweet and savory sauce. The dumplings are steamed, then deep-fried to keep the wrapper from drying out.   Momo    Momo are dumplings found in northern Indian, Nepali and Tibetan cuisine. They may be filled with meat, vegetables or cheese, and are usually served with a tomato-based dipping sauce. Enterprising Nepali vendors in Kathmandu have also taken to filling momos with Snickers and Mars bars, especially in areas frequented by tourists.  Uszka  Uszka are similar to Polish pierogi \u2013 the word \u201cuszka\u201d means \u201clittle ears\u201d in Polish. They\u2019re usually filled with minced meat and mushrooms and put in borscht soup. Uszka stuffed with bolete mushrooms and chopped onions without meat are served in clear borscht for Christmas Eve meals in Poland.  Gyoza   Related to Chinese pot stickers, Japanese gyoza tend to be made with thinner wrappers and filled with minced pork. Frozen gyoza are found in most grocery stores all over the world, but the best restaurants for gyoza always turn out to be holes-in-the-wall outside of Tokyo subway stations.   Crab rangoon   Found on Chinese takeout menus in the United States, crab rangoon are deep-fried dumplings served as a side dish. They\u2019re stuffed with cream cheese and imitation crab meat made from a fish-based paste.   It may not be an authentic Chinese dish, but love of fried cheese crosses cultures.  Teochew fun gor    Not your typical pork-filled dumpling, the Teochew fun gor is usually packed with peanuts, chives, dried shrimp, pork, radish, mushrooms and cilantro.  The wrapper is made of a combination of wheat flour, tapioca flour, corn starch and potato starch, giving the fun gor its translucent appearance. Teochew fun gor is most popular in Cantonese dim sum restaurants.  Samosa    Usually triangular in shape, samosas are a deep-fried snack popular in south and southeast Asia. They may be filled with a variety of stuffings, including potato, onions, peas, lentils and ground lamb.  Khinkali    Straddling Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia, it\u2019s not surprising that Georgia has its own dumpling. The khinkali resembles the xiaolongbao. It\u2019s formed by gathering the pleats of the wrapper at the top and stuffed with spiced beef and pork. Khinkali are usually served with coarse ground black pepper.  Gnocchi    Gnocchi are small, thick pasta shapes that can be made from semolina flour, potato, flour, eggs, cheese \u2013 or a combination of the lot. They originated in northern Italy, though are eaten throughout the country today, with recipes varying from region to region. Gnocchi are prepared like other pasta dishes, and may be served in tomato-based sauces, pesto sauces or with any other sauce you might find on pasta.  Daifuku    Duty-free shops in Japanese airports are packed with what look like mountains of pre-wrapped boxes of Japanese treats. Many of these boxes actually contain daifuku. They are a type of mochi (glutinous rice cakes), only they\u2019re stuffed \u2013 usually with sticky-sweet red azuki. Daifuku are popular as gifts in Japan \u2013 specialty stores that create a dazzling array of varieties move countless boxes over holiday periods.  Amish apple dumpling  The apple dumpling is popular across the United States, and common among the Amish, especially in and around Pennsylvania.  A peeled and cored apple is stuffed with cinnamon and sugar, then wrapped in a piece of dough and baked until the apple becomes tender. The pairing of the apple dumpling, fresh from the oven, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top makes for a divine dessert.  Ravioli del plin  Every region of Italy produces its own filled pasta, of course, but these, from southern Piedmont, are particularly prized. Much smaller than regular ravioli \u2013 they\u2019re barely bigger than Bolognese tortellini \u2013 they\u2019re filled with either a meat mix (which often includes rabbit) and served with a glaze of meaty sauce, or contain a vegetable mix, often cabbage with rice.  As well as being small in size, the pasta is also rolled super thin, so the dumplings seem to melt in the mouth. \u201cPlin\u201d isn\u2019t the place where they came from; the word derives from a local dialect word for \u201cpinch,\u201d as the pockets are pinched together by hand.  Shish barak  This is the ultimate Lebanese comfort food: lamb dumplings, similar to manti, and served drenched in yoghurt \u2013 usually goat, rather than cow, to give the flavor a bit more bang.  The lamb is mixed with pine nuts and spices before being wrapped in the dough, and slow-cooked in the yoghurt with water. It\u2019s labor-intensive \u2013 requiring constant stirring, to keep the consistency.   Ashak  These vegetarian dumplings hail from Afghanistan, and are also similar to manti. Recipes vary, but the stalwart is some kind of green vegetable inside \u2013 which can be chives, scallions, or celery, as they make it in Venice\u2019s refugee-run Orient Experience restaurant.

It\u2019s highly likely visitors have encountered the characters of the country\u2019s famed \u201cmasked drama\u201d at some point during their travels without even realizing it. At Suvarnabhumi International Airport in Bangkok, for instance, large statues of yak, or giant ogres, tower over departing passengers. These giants are among the many colorful characters that appear in the Ramakien, a national Thai epic based on\u00a0the\u00a0Hindu tale of Ramayana. And Khon, dating back to the Ayutthaya era (1351\u20131767), brings the many stories of\u00a0this classic piece of literature to life by combining dance, martial arts and traditional Thai music with exquisite costumes and jewelry, earning it a spot on UNESCO\u2019s Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity list in 2018. Backstage at Sala Chalermkrung Royal Theatre In Khon, there are a few groups of characters but the main ones are the \u201cPhra\u201d (lords), the \u201cNang\u201d (ladies), those aforementioned \u201cYak\u201d (ogres), and the \u201cLing\u201d (monkeys). The monkey and ogre performers all wear masks, while the other characters accentuate their facial features with dramatic, bold makeup. (Dialogue is voiced by a narrator, who is unseen during the performance.) These days, Khon is performed everywhere from schools to special events, and even in tourist-frequented Thai restaurants. But one of the best places to experience an authentic Khon performance is Bangkok\u2019s Sala Chalermkrung Royal Theatre. On a recent visit to this historic space, which hosts three shows per day, five days a week, CNN headed backstage to speak with the Khon performers and find out about the challenges of keeping this art form alive in modern times. The two main leads of this particular Khon show, who play Hanuman (the Monkey King) and the Princess Mermaid (Suvannamaccha), must arrive several hours early to prepare for the day\u2019s three performances. (See them perform together in the above video.) Apassara Nok-ork, 35, plays the role of the mermaid, or golden fish, who tries to wreck Hanuman\u2019s plans to build a bridge across the sea. Plot twist: She falls in love with him instead. As she applies heavy, detailed makeup to her face, Apassara tells CNN she has been studying traditional Thai dance since she was around four years old, choosing to focus on Khon from the age of 15. \u201cWe have to start it at a very young age,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd we have to keep practicing the routine, and keep training our body to maintain our strength, since the costume is really heavy. While we perform, if we didn\u2019t have enough training, our exhaustion will show and the audience would see it.\u201d Among the most important skills a Khon performer must possess is flexibility. Even the hand movements the female dancers carry out on stage are highly unnatural, the result of years of intense training. When asked to demonstrate her own flexibility, Apassara grasps the four fingers of her left hand at the tips, pulling them back with her right hand, her wrist joint bending back to a position that would debilitate most. She says the training required to get to this skill level tends to weed out those who aren\u2019t truly passionate about the art. \u201cPeople who don\u2019t have enough physical and mental strength, they may just quit in the middle of the studies,\u201d she says. When Apassara gets on stage for the first show of the day at Sala Chalermkrung, not a hint of tiredness can be seen on her face. In spite of the weight of the metallic headpiece \u2013 its strap pulled tightly across her chin \u2013 and the masses of golden fabric that envelop her body, she moves effortlessly across the stage, evading the chasing Hanuman until they meet for a beautiful duet. For Apassara, all of the pain and hard work over the years has been worth it. \u201cKhon has taken me to perform at grand ceremonies including royal events, it also has taken me to faraway places \u2013 I have traveled all over the world,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel proud every time I am able to present this valuable art to audiences. I still feel excited every single time I perform, no matter how many times I have done it before.\u201d Behind the mask with Hanuman The masks worn by those playing the roles of giants and monkeys vary depending on the character\u2019s status and rank, and can take weeks and even months for skilled artisans to create. Many of the masked characters also need to be sewn into their costumes for the perfect fit \u2013 zippers and buttons simply won\u2019t do the trick. That includes Hanuman, the Monkey King. Among the performers tasked with playing that role at Sala Chalermkrung is 34-year-old Thanet Pakwisath, who has been practicing Khon for more than 20 years. He tells CNN the acrobatics that the monkey must perform, including leaps and summersaults, requires incredible strength and constant training \u2013 a commitment he is happy to make. \u201cKhon is more than my life now,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I believe that other performers here at Sala Chalermkrung would have the same belief.\u201d But like many of his colleagues, he fears for its fate. \u201cI want people to pay attention to Khon more, because I don\u2019t know if it will disappear in the future or people may not care about it anymore,\u201d says Thanet. \u201cCurrently, there is only a small group of people who are preserving it. I want everyone to help \u2013 both Thai people and foreigners.\u201d Sala Chalermkrung: A living museum Bangkok\u2019s Sala Chalermkrung Royal Theater has its own fascinating back story. Located on historic Charoenkrung Road \u2013 Bangkok\u2019s first paved street \u2013 it celebrated its 90th anniversary in 2023. Sponsored by King Prajadhipok\u00a0to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the founding of Bangkok, upon opening in 1933 it gave locals a chance to experience films with sound \u2013 most of them foreign movies dubbed in Thai \u2013 in a modernist, high-tech building with air conditioning. It wasn\u2019t until after World War II that Thai film really flourished \u2013 and so did the cinema. Sala Chalermkrung became synonymous with film openings, its premieres attended by movie stars among other Thai celebrities. But from the late 1970s, visitors to Sala Chalermkrung began to decline. When the 1990s rolled around, it was time to make a change. Following a series of renovations, it reopened with a new purpose: To showcase and preserve Khon, along with other classic Thai performing arts. Thankfully, the building\u2019s original charms have been retained, from the lobby to the theater itself. These days, the shows at Sala Chalermkrung are rotated periodically, with staff telling CNN a new Khon performance will be introduced in July. Visitors can buy a ticket at the door for 400 baht ($11) however, admission to the nearby Grand Palace (500 baht) includes a free pass to one of the theater\u2019s weekday Khon performances, which take place at 1 p.m., 2:30 p.m. and 4 p.m. Sala Chalermkrung Royal Theater, 66 Sala Chalermkrung, Charoenkrung Road, Phra Nakhon District, Bangkok; +66 (0)2 224 4499 ", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/sala-chalermkrung-khon-unesco-bangkok-masked-drama/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_inappropriate-behavior-shuts-down-dublin-new-york-portal", "text": "That didn\u2019t take long. Less than a week after two public sculptures featuring a livestream between Dublin, Ireland, and New York City debuted, \u201cinappropriate behavior\u201d in real-time interactions between people in the two cities has prompted a temporary shutdown. The two sculptures, \u201cThe Portals,\u201d are round, lens-like installations with a 24/7 video link to allow residents and visitors in the two cities to interact with each other. Social media videos have shown people flashing body parts to people on the other side. The installation does not include audio. The creators of the sculptures are now \u201cinvestigating possible technical solutions to inappropriate behaviour by a small minority of people in front of the Portal,\u201d according to a statement from the Dublin City Council. \u201cDublin City Council had hoped to have a solution in place today, but unfortunately the preferred solution, which would have involved blurring, was not satisfactory,\u201d the City Council said late Tuesday. The team behind the sculptures, Portals.org, is looking at other options. The City Council planned to switch off the live stream at 10 p.m. local time Tuesday and said that Portals.org expected to be able to turn it on again later this week. \u201cWe are delighted by how many people have been enjoying the Portal since it was launched last week,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt has become a global phenomenon and it is important to note that the overwhelming majority of people interacting with the Dublin Portal have behaved appropriately.\u201d Organizers in New York also underlined that the inappropriate behavior has come from \u201ca very small minority\u201d of visitors. \u201cIn New York, we have had a set of protocols in place since the Portal\u2019s launch, including 24/7 on-site security and barriers to prevent people from stepping onto the Portal,\u201d said a statement from Flatiron NoMad Partnership, one of the project\u2019s organizers in New York. While the creators and their partners in both cities work on \u201cadditional solutions to limit such behavior appearing on the livestream,\u201d the New York Portal will be turned off for a few days starting at 5 p.m. local time Tuesday, according to Flatiron NoMad Partnership. On the Dublin side, the portal is installed facing the capital city\u2019s main street, O\u2019Connell Street. In New York, the portal sculpture is located on the Flatiron South Public Plaza at Broadway, Fifth Avenue and 23rd Street. The Portals are the brainchild of Lithuanian artist Benediktas Gylys. The project\u2019s intention, according to Daith\u00ed de R\u00f3iste, Dublin\u2019s Lord Mayor, was to expand global connections. \u201cOne of my key aims as Lord Mayor is to make the City more inclusive. The Portals project embodies this, bringing together technology, engineering and art to bring communities from across the world closer together and to allow people to meet and connect outside of their social circles and cultures,\u201d de R\u00f3iste said in a news release on May 8 announcing the project\u2019s debut. The Lord Mayor noted the \u201cdeep historical and cultural bond\u201d between the two cities. In July, Dublin expects to connect to destinations in Poland, Brazil and Lithuania, according to de R\u00f3iste\u2019s statement. \u201cI would encourage Dubliners and visitors to the City to come and interact with the sculpture and extend an Irish welcome and kindness to cities all over the world,\u201d de R\u00f3iste\u2019s May 8 statement said. De R\u00f3iste said the portals project is part of events lined up to coincide with Dublin\u2019s 2024 EU Capital of Smart Tourism Designation. The Dublin-New York city pairing isn\u2019t the first real-time bridge between cities through these sculptures. The first Portals, according to the organization\u2019s website, linked Vilnius, Lithuania, with Lublin, Poland, in 2021.

{"id": "travel_europes-best-long-distance-hiking-trails", "text": "The slow approach to travel has never been more important. From overtourism to taking multiple flights, rushing from A to B isn\u2019t just stressful, it can be environmentally damaging. Which is why, sometimes travel needs to be stripped back to basics \u2013 a pair of boots, a backpack and a map. These mind-loosening multi-day hikes on some of Europe\u2019s best long distance trails offer a chance to reconnect with the world, get some invigorating exercise and enjoy peaceful moments in some of the continent\u2019s most beautiful scenery. Hyssna Trail, Sweden West Sweden\u2019s quiet beauty is the star of the show on this 40-kilometer (25-mile), two-day hike. A circular route, it starts at Hyssna\u2019s 12th century church, which can be accessed by bus from Gothenburg in just 40 minutes. The trail passes through towering beech forests and offers the opportunity for a refreshing dip in Lilla H\u00e5lsj\u00f6n lake, where there\u2019s a dedicated swimming spot. The route is well signposted, with plenty of picnic spots and a well appointed camp site. For those in need of something a tad more luxurious, there\u2019s the\u00a0Hyssna Forest Resort, where five star cabins feature their own outdoor showers, vast picture windows and king size beds. Karhunkierros Trail, Finland Finnish Lapland is renowned as a winter destination, with magical displays of\u00a0aurora borealis\u00a0and a fascinating ancient\u00a0Sami\u00a0culture. It\u2019s also home to the 82-kilometer (51-mile) Karhunkierros Trail, the most well-known long-distance walk in Finland. It\u2019s a route best explored in summer, when the nights are bright and the forests verdant. The path begins in Hautaja\u0308rvi village in Lapland\u2019s Salla and ends at the Rukatunturi Fell in Kuusamo, taking four days, depending on the weather, which can change rapidly. Passing through\u00a0Oulanka National Park, there\u2019s a sense of being in a true wilderness, where trout leap from rivers and lynx and wolverines prowl through the pines. King Charles III England Coastal Path, England Covering a colossal 4,300 kilometers (2,672 miles), the\u00a0England Coast Path, named after the country\u2019s king since 2022, is a lifetime\u2019s undertaking for those who wish to cover every step. The good news is that it can be easily broken down into sections, with northwest, northeast, east, southeast and southwest regions to explore. Whether taking in the rugged, high cliffs and gorgeous bays of Cornwall or the vast skies and deep silence of Suffolk and Norfolk, just a few days on this epic route will leave anyone rejuvenated. Slovenian Mountain Trail, Slovenia It\u2019s no surprise that the\u00a0Slovenia Mountain Trail\u00a0has become so popular. This stunning route, covering some 616 kilometers (362 miles) runs from Maribor in the country\u2019s northeast, all the way to Ankaran, on the Adriatic Coast. And while doing it all in one go over 28 days might seem extreme, it can be broken into smaller sections. There are routes through the forests and primeval bogs of the Pohorje Hills or across the Julian Alps, much of which form part of the beautiful Triglav National Park. There are 49 different mountain huts to choose from and those opting to complete the entire trek will scale some 23 mountains in the process. John Muir Way, Scotland Known as the \u201cFather of the National Parks\u201d in the US, Muir\u2019s passion for the outdoors led him to set up the Sierra Club, arguably America\u2019s most important environmental organization, as well as ensuring that the Yosemite Valley gained protected status. It isn\u2019t just in the United States where Muir is memorialized. In his native Scotland, the\u00a0John Muir Way\u00a0stretches coast to coast, from Helensburgh on the Firth of Clyde to Dunbar, Muir\u2019s birthplace on the Firth of Forth. The 215-kilometer (134-mile) route takes around 10 days to complete, passing through Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park and through some of Scotland\u2019s most bucolic and underappreciated countryside. Vikos Gorge and Mount Gamila, Zagoria, Greece The remote and beautiful mountains of Zagoria are arguably Greece\u2019s best-kept secret. Tucked away in the northwest of the country, they offer spectacular hiking without the crowds. The highlight is undoubtedly the Vikos Gorge, which according to the Guinness Book of Records is the deepest gorge relative to its width in the world. In places, its cliffs tower 1,350 meters (4,429 feet). Wander its dry riverbed in summer and keep an eye out for rare wild chamois hopping across the cliff faces.\u00a0Trekking Hellas\u00a0offers a three-day trek including the gorge and the chance to head to a mountain refuge on nearby Mount Gamila. Apuseni Mountains, Romania The untamed Apuseni Mountains in western Romania, part of the wider Carpathian Range, offer an insight into a part of Europe where time still moves slowly and the way of life is steeped in tradition. Hiking through the majestic hills and seemingly endless forests, you can see peregrine falcons circling on thermals high above, while the footprints of wolves and European brown bears point to the presence of some of the continent\u2019s most elusive creatures.\u00a0Much Better Adventures\u00a0runs a four day snowshoeing trek through the region in winter, where guests stay with Romanian families and receive a proper local welcome. The Camino Frances, France and Spain The Camino de Santiago is Europe\u2019s most famous pilgrimage route, finishing in Santiago de Compostela in the Galicia region of northwest Spain. It is here where the remains of the apostle St James are said to be buried. Traditionally, pilgrims headed here from their homes from all across Europe, but now hikers have multiple ways to walk \u201cthe Camino,\u201d whether across Spain, from Portugal or France. The\u00a0Camino Frances\u00a0is the most popular route, starting in St. Jean in France before heading through Pamplona and Leon before arriving in Santiago. The full route can take seven weeks, or the final 100 kilometers, from Sarria, can be tackled in about six or seven days. Alta Via Uno, Dolomites, Italy Italy\u2019s Dolomites are one of the most rugged and awe-inspiring ranges on the continent. Those up for the challenge can hike from Dobbiaco in the north to Belluno in the south, a 120-kilometer (75-mile) jaunt that takes nine days. The route clambers over rocky outcrops as jagged snow covered peaks rear up all around. The region\u2019s hospitable mountain huts offer overnight places to rest and recuperate ahead of another tough day in the hills. It\u2019s worth taking time to explore around Passo Falzarego, where battles were fought during World War I. Some sections have cables to help walkers cross tough terrain. Trekkers will need to be in good shape, but it\u2019s an unforgettable experience. Engadine Panorama Trail, Switzerland Summers in Switzerland are the stuff of dreams for those who love to strap on their boots and set off on an adventure. With warm temperatures, wildflower meadows and looming Alps, it\u2019s a place for a proper escape from the day-to-day. While many routes head high into the mountains, the Engadine Panorama Trail is more sedate, ideal for beginners or those keen on something less strenuous. The 55-kilometer (34-miles) route in the southeast of the country starts in Zernez and takes in traditional villages and sparkling lakes, with spectacular Alpine views at every turn. Ibex can often be spotted climbing high above the paths, which are well signposted. Tour du Mont Blanc, France, Italy and Switzerland Few multi-day hikes in Europe fire the imagination like the Tour du Mont Blanc. This 11 day epic covers 170 kilometers (105 miles) over 11 days and takes in three countries - France, Italy and Switzerland - following a route around western Europe\u2019s highest mountain. The good news is that things are extremely well organized, with regular water fountains and refuges every few miles. However, don\u2019t show up thinking you can just bunk down for the night after a long day\u2019s walking: Huts and refuges require booking in advance during the busy summer months. Hiking anticlockwise from the village of Les Houches offers relentless views of Mont Blanc.\u00a0Tour du Mont Blanc Hike\u00a0offers bespoke guidance on getting the most from the trip. Rota Vicentina Fishermen\u2019s Trail, Portugal A network of single-day and multi-day paths in the Alentejo and Algarve regions in southern Portugal, the Rota Vicentina can be easily overlooked for the mountainous thrills of central Europe. But the Fisherman\u2019s Trail, a 225-kilometer (140-mile) path which cleaves to the Atlantic coastline, offers a wild and memorable alternative. Following routes used by fishermen to access the ocean, this trail makes its way along sandy paths and over high cliff tops, with walkers having to contend with the wind and changing weather. The reward comes in the form of azure waters and huge views, not to mention the sense of being reinvigorated by all that sea air. Laugavegur Hiking Trail, Iceland Inaccessible during winter, Iceland\u2019s ethereal Laugavegur Hiking Trail opens between July and September, drawing in committed hikers from across the globe. The reason? Its landscape is unlike anything else on Earth. Shaped by glaciers and the country\u2019s relentless volcanic activity, this is a place where it\u2019s impossible not to feel utterly infinitesimal. The 55-kilometer (34-mile) route is best done over four days, giving time to tackle the challenging terrain and take in the views. Highlights include bathing in the geothermal springs at Landmannalaugar, marveling at the colorful slopes of Brennisteinsalda and walking over the lush valley of Hvanngil. Six dedicated huts and adjacent campsites are available, but booking ahead or signing up for a guided adventure as advised as the path can get busy.\u00a0Much Better Adventures\u00a0has a range of options. Sheep\u2019s Head Way, Cork, Ireland Ireland doesn\u2019t lack when it comes to lush, windswept vistas. And few can match the\u00a0Sheep\u2019s Head Way, a 93-kilometer (57-mile route) in Cork, which takes in some of the county\u2019s, and the country\u2019s, most dramatic coastline. Starting in the town of Bantry, it heads out to the Sheep\u2019s Head peninsula and its titular lighthouse, with views\u00a0 across the raging, bright blue Atlantic to the Beara and Mizen peninsulas. The route itself takes six days, but there are options to cut it short or opt for less taxing day hikes if the weather gets a little wild. Which, in this magical part of the world, it often does.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/europes-best-long-distance-hiking-trails/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_us-air-force-medical-airlift-carnival-cruise-ship", "text": "A US Air Force rescue team airlifted a civilian passenger needing urgent medical care this past weekend from a Carnival cruise ship that was hundreds of miles out in open Atlantic waters. The dramatic May 4 medical rescue involved three helicopter air-to-air refuelings to reach the Carnival Venezia, according to a news release from the 920th Rescue Wing. The Venezia was returning to port in New York City after various stops in the Bahamas and Caribbean but was about 350 nautical miles (about 400 land miles or 645 kilometers) away from the US mainland. Called into action from Patrick Space Force Base in Florida were two HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters, two HC-130J Combat King II aircraft and two teams of combat rescue officers and pararescuemen, the release said. Because of the distance that had to be covered, the 920th Rescue Wing had to employ the helicopter air-to-air refuelings, also called HAAR, \u201cwhich involves connecting a probe from the helicopter to a drogue on the HC-130J aircraft, allowing fuel transfer mid-flight,\u201d the release said. When the aircraft arrived, rescuers were hoisted down from the helicopters and began preparing the patient for transport, the release said. The patient and his mother were taken up into the helicopter, and he received medical attention en route to a hospital on the mainland. Neither the 920th Rescue Wing nor the cruise line had further information about the patient\u2019s condition or where he was taken for treatment. \u201cEveryone in the wing mobilized with exceptional speed,\u201d said Capt. Dylan Gann, 301st Rescue Squadron pilot, in the release. \u201cBy uniting our efforts, we saved crucial time, delivering life-saving assistance six hours ahead of other response teams.\u201d Carnival told CNN Travel that the cruise line worked with Air Force and US Coast Guard officials to adjust Venezia\u2019s course to meet the medical helicopter. The ship continued toward New York after the medical airlift and arrived as scheduled on Monday.

{"id": "travel_article_how-to-avoid-survive-cobra-bite", "text": "Thailand is full of snakes \u2013 more than 200 species, including cobras. That might be unsettling for some people, but it was ideal for Prangmart Charoenwai as a boy in southern Thailand. He was intrigued by the reptiles. He once captured a nonvenomous sunbeam snake, letting it go days later when he couldn\u2019t feed it properly. He watched online videos to learn techniques in grabbing them, he told CNN. He saw his first cobra when he was about 15 or 16.  \u201cIt was quite big,\u201d Prangmart, now 39, said. \u201cI later saw that snake spread its hood. I stood there watching its behavior. It threatened me, but I felt it was not scary. \u2026 I thought it was beautiful.\u201d His fascination and confidence grew, but his good fortune with cobras didn\u2019t last. In April 2021, the market owner went out on a mission in Trang province in southern Thailand with his rescue group, which responds to routine emergency response tasks, including snake-catching.   Residents in the area said they were concerned about some king cobras. Prangmart arrived at the site with about 15 team members. They didn\u2019t find any cobras the first day, but that changed the next day after some thick brush and overgrown vines were cleared out. \u201cI saw a hole in a big rock where I spotted a snake\u2019s tail, and it looked like it was going into that hole,\u201d Prangmart recalled. \u201cI ran there quickly, and then used a hook to try to get it out.\u201d  But the snake eluded the device.  \u201cDue to my carelessness, because I have been working in this area for too long, I decided to use my bare hand to snatch the cobra\u2019s tail out.\u201d That impulsive grab turned out to be a major miscalculation. Cobras and their world Cobras have an extensive range \u2013 from much of Africa into the Middle East, then into India and the rest of South Asia. From there, they continue into Southeast Asia and Indonesia. That puts them in potential contact with billions of people.  They belong to the elapid family of snakes, which has roughly 300 venomous species. Coral snakes, sea snakes, mambas and kraits are also in this group.  There are about 30 cobra species, according to expert Rom Whitaker, who helped start the Madras Crocodile Bank Trust in India. (Its spinoff, the Irula Snake-catchers Industrial Cooperative Society, supplies the venom used to produce life-saving antivenom to India).   Whitaker said he uses an approximation of the number of species because cobra taxonomy often changes as experts learn more about the snakes. Africa accounts for roughly two-thirds of the species.  Generally, cobras deliver a neurotoxin, which interferes with nerve impulses and can cause paralysis of the heart and lungs. That\u2019s different from that of many vipers, such as rattlesnakes. They generally have a hemotoxin that attacks the blood vessels and causes bleeding and tissue damage. But Nick Brandehoff, who practices emergency medicine and medical toxicology in Colorado and California, said he and other experts are learning that snake venom is more complicated than that simple breakdown. Some elapids have hemotoxic properties, and some vipers have neurotoxic properties. It can vary from snake to snake.  Either way, venomous snakebites are a serious problem in many tropical regions. Only an average of five people die a year of venomous snakebites in the United States, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the World Health Organization estimates around 81,000 to 138,000 people die each year worldwide from snakebites, while about three times that many people live with permanent disabilities. Aggressive or defensive? Despite the high number of deaths and envenomings (bites in which venom is delivered into the body), don\u2019t assume cobras are aggressive. \u201cCobras are shy snakes, and though they make a dramatic show when cornered and alarmed, rearing up, spreading a hood, and hissing loudly, this is stark fear, not aggression,\u201d said Whitaker. \u201cThe snake only wants to be left alone.\u201d Brandehoff, who helps run the Asclepius Snakebite Foundation, added that \u201cthey\u2019re typical of most other snakes in that they don\u2019t want human contact.\u201d And he emphasized cobras don\u2019t chase people.  Kim Gray, curator of herpetology and ichthyology with the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, cited another reason cobras don\u2019t like to bite people. \u201cVenom is valuable to the snake, and it is used to immobilize prey and begin the digestion process, which the snake needs because it eats whole food items and has no limbs to help it in this process,\u201d Gray said.  \u201cSo it does not want to waste its venom by recklessly biting and envenoming all the humans it can encounter.\u201d Biting is a last resort if its typical warning signs to back off don\u2019t work, she said. Are tourists at risk? The vast majority of cobra bites happen to agricultural workers in fields and other locals, often low-income people living in easy-to-enter dwellings and who sleep on the floor, Brandehoff said. \u201cThough people have an idea that the \u2018jungle is full of snakes,\u2019 that\u2019s really not true,\u201d Whitaker added. \u201cCobras are most common in agricultural areas thanks to the proliferation of their favorite prey: rats and mice. \u201cAlert snakes like cobras are frightened of humans and usually flee or freeze when a human approaches. The odds of encountering a cobra on the usual tourist routes in India or Thailand are very slim.\u201d  People staying in hotels with full facilities in a city have less to worry about than those in rural, rustic facilities, Gray said.  If you do find yourself bedding down in a place more likely to attract cobras, she suggested: \u2022 Keep debris away from the shelter\u2022 Clean up food and grains that might attract rats\u2022 Try to keep furniture higher up off the floor and sleep in an elevated bed. Whitaker said it is essential to shine a flashlight when walking at night and not put your hands in thick, bushy spots. What to do if you spot a cobra The experts are unanimous: Leave the snake alone. \u201cMove deliberately and calmly away from the snake \u2013 while keeping an eye on its location if possible,\u201d Gray said. \u201cMove to an open area free of brush and rock outcrops if possible\u201d if you\u2019re outdoors. \u201cDo not try to restrain it, capture it or kill it with a broom or shovel or anything,\u201d she emphasized. Brandehoff concurred. \u201cGive it its space. You are a large mammalian predator to them. They do not want to engage you.\u201d  Whitaker said that bites \u201cusually don\u2019t happen from the strike of a cobra in the hooded posture but \u2026 happen when the snake is stressed by being stepped upon or mistakenly grabbed.\u201d What should you do if you chance on a cobra that\u2019s already really close and seems ready to strike? \u201cMove quickly away,\u201d Gray said. \u201cHuman reaction time is so slow compared to their strike so there may not be much you can do \u2013 but typically the trajectory of the cobra\u2019s bite is forward and downward, and they are not able to change direction mid-strike, so perhaps a sideways rapid move away from the snake may be beneficial.\u201d A serious misstep in capturing a cobra  Prangmart Charoenwai\u2019s impulsive maneuver to grab an escaping cobra cost him.  \u201cThe hole was not deep; the snake made a U-turn out quicker than I thought.\u201d  That\u2019s when it happened. Prangmart got bit on his left thumb. Then he got bit on his right hand. Despite the strikes, Prangmart was determined to capture and bag the cobra himself since he was already bitten \u2013 even though his left hand was already getting numb. \u201cI was told to step aside; I refused. Instead, they told me to stay chilled and urged me to quickly go to the hospital and treat my wound.\u201d They finally bagged the cobra, and Prangmart was able to walk to an ambulance. But his trouble had just started \u2013 the hospital was two hours away.  What to do if you are bitten As Prangmart was learning the hard way, cobra bites are very serious business. But they are by no means a death sentence. \u201cMost snakebites, even cobra bites, are not fatal.\u201d Whitaker said. \u201cBut any snakebite must be treated as a medical emergency. \u201cThe single most important thing to do is to get to a hospital without any delay. Do not resort to any local or home remedy because there is only one cure for a snakebite and that is antivenom.\u201d Gray said that you should try to stay calm and \u201cimmobilize the limb that was bitten, get to the closest hospital without delay (and) make a note of where the bite occurred and the time the bite occurred.\u201d  Also, get a description or photo of the snake if it can be taken safely. This can help doctors with treatment, she said.   Do not tie a tourniquet or try the old \u201ccut and suction\u201d method, Whitaker said, nor should you use a so-called \u201csnakebite kit.\u201d Brandehoff said that if the bite comes from a cobra with strictly neurotoxic venom, people may recommend a crepe wrap, which can help reduce the spread of the venom from a limb to the rest of the body via compression.  \u201cThe problem with that is most people don\u2019t know what kind of snake bit them\u201d and that it\u2019s not reasonable to expect people to readily ID various cobra species.  And if the venom has hemotoxic properties, a wrap can cause more harm than good, damaging tissue around the bite area, he said. Rings and other jewelry should be removed. \u201cThe earlier antivenom can be administered, the better your chances of not having long-term disability or potentially dying,\u201d he said.    Spitting cobras can cause \u201cvenom ophthalmoplegia,\u201d which is basically burning of the eyes, Brandehoff said. Permanent damage can occur but is rarer.   The main treatment is washing the eyes \u201ccopiously,\u201d he said. \u2018I thought I may not make it\u2019 Prangmart\u2019s arrival at the hospital in Thailand did not end his emergency. \u201cAfter I received the serum, I had an allergic reaction,\u201d he said. \u201cI started to have short breaths, rashes. The doctor had to rush back and treated me again. I was watched regularly during that time.\u201d Was he afraid he would die? \u201cThe severe conditions I had to endure at the hospital lasted about two hours. It was when I thought I may not make it. My heart rate was racing, too.\u201d Prangmart pulled through the immediate crisis but then embarked on a 15-day ordeal, bouncing between Western medical doctors and practitioners of Thai traditional medicine to try to save his left hand, where repeated infections threatened to spread.  He eventually got better, but he\u2019s left with a big scar, an important reminder for him and the rest of his team. \u201cAt that time when I saw the snake, I felt excited and I didn\u2019t want it to escape into the hole. Because of that excitement, I hurriedly grabbed the snake. What happened to me, it was my own carelessness.\u201d  And if someone else should encounter a cobra? \u201cKeep calm and watch it; don\u2019t hurry, turn your back and run. \u2026 If you are very scared, start to retreat backward step by step,\u201d he said. \u201cGenerally, these snakes are not likely to attack people first unless there is clear threat to them.\u201d  Why cobras aren\u2019t our enemies Cobras keep the environment in balance. \u201cWithout cobras, the rodent problem in agricultural areas could lead to famine,\u201d Whitaker said. \u201cThese are the most efficient rodent predators in existence, able to enter rat burrows and clean out the entire family.\u201d But he said antivenom efforts must continue. \u201cThose of us who appreciate and respect snakes need to support programs to help reduce the tremendous burden of snakebites affecting tens of millions of rural people in Africa, Asia and South America,\u201d Whitaker said. Brandehoff agreed: \u201cWe can\u2019t attempt to eradicate snakebites like we can malaria. The best thing we can do is try to mitigate snakebites by trying to minimize contacts.\u201d  We need to \u201clearn to live with them. \u2026 In a lot of cultures, there\u2019s a lot of fear of snakes. See a snake, kill a snake; it\u2019s not helpful.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/article/how-to-avoid-survive-cobra-bite/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
