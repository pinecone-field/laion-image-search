Chez Michou, which lies in the hilltop neighborhood of Montmartre in the French capital, announced in a Facebook post Monday that it will be closing its doors with \u201cgreat regret\u201d due to \u201cfinancial reasons.\u201d The club said it staged its last performance on Sunday evening, using its Facebook post to thank its final audience for \u201cmaking the evening so festive and moving.\u201d Chez Michou was founded in 1956 by cabaret artist Michel Catty, known simply as Michou. Michou\u2019s colorful drag performances made him a household name in France and he was known for habitually dressing in extravagant blue outfits. Michou was still running his club when he died in February 2020. French President Emmanuel Macron was one of the many high-profile figures to pay tribute, saying after he died that \u201cthe sky of Montmartre, from now on, will be a little less blue.\u201d His storied club inspired the classic 1978 French film \u201cLa Cage aux Folles,\u201d which was later remade into Hollywood title \u201cThe Birdcage\u201d starring Robin Williams in 1996. In recent years, however, the club came into financial difficulty, and will now be unable to honor its bookings for the coming months. Just last week, it announced its participation in a pride event in Liege, Belgium, in August. The owners hope a liquidator is appointed in the next two weeks to help find a buyer for the property, they said. \u201cWe are deeply sorry to have to cancel our performances and for any inconvenience this may cause,\u201d the club told its patrons on Facebook Monday. Catherine Catty-Jacquart, the niece of Michou, who took over operations after his death in 2020, previously told French national news agency AFP that life running a cabaret was \u201cdifficult.\u201d  \u201cWe\u2019re living from day to day,\u201d Jacquart said, adding that bookings for July had not filled up despite the Olympic Games taking place in the French capital. In its announcement, the club paid special tribute to its patrons who they called \u201cpart of the Cabaret Chez Michou family,\u201d adding: \u201cWhatever happens, you will always have a place in our hearts.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/travel/club-michou-closes-paris-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_uk-tourism-drop-visitor-numbers-election", "text": "It\u2019s hardly a great tourism slogan. \u201cBritain is grinding to a halt\u201d was the verdict of the UK\u2019s Labour Party on the country they hoped to govern, as they were setting out their case for election in June. On July 4, they won by a landslide, promising change. As residents wonder what to expect day-to-day, those abroad might wonder what it means for their travel plans. Because one industry that could do with a change is tourism. Since time immemorial, visitors have flocked to the UK. Its heritage and cultural sites have traditionally made it one of the jewels in Europe\u2019s crown. Yet while visitor numbers are up across the board on the continent \u2013 nearly all EU member states saw numbers rise in 2023 year-on-year \u2013 the UK has not yet caught up with pre-pandemic numbers. Nearly 41 million overseas residents visited the UK in 2019. In 2023, 37.68 million entered \u2013 a drop of 7.3%. Compare that with Italy, which set a new record for arrivals numbers in 2023. Only Luxembourg saw a drop of 0.1% fewer tourists. What\u2019s more, international visitors applying for a tourist visa were down by 19% on pre-pandemic numbers. The slow recovery coincides with tourism-allied hiccups. Regular strikes have been hampering transport. \u201cRail cancelations are at record levels,\u201d according to the new government in its pre-election manifesto. The UK has a glorious coastline, but in recent years many beaches are increasingly polluted by sewage. Tax-free shopping for tourists has been axed, and EU visitors now need a passport to visit, which most don\u2019t have. And in 2024, the rhetoric around safety in the capital has been ramped up. In February, then prime minister Rishi Sunak suggested the country was descending into \u201cmob rule.\u201d He also flagged a 20% rise in knife crime in London in May. His comments were political, made while campaigning for local elections. Yet few listening from abroad would have noted the context. So what\u2019s gone wrong for the UK \u2013 and can the incoming government turn it around? Labour\u2019s pre-election manifesto, in which the party outlined its plans for the country, pretty much ignored the tourism industry. But it didn\u2019t mince its words when describing the problems. \u201cBritain is grinding to a halt,\u201d it said. \u201cRail cancelations are at record levels\u2026 Conservative chaos has seen major projects abandoned, decades-long delays\u2026 and our infrastructure crumbling.\u201d The party has promised to \u201cmodernize\u201d UK transport infrastructure, \u201crebuilding Britain.\u201d The railways will be brought under public ownership. Those traveling by car will be pleased to know that Labour also pledged to repair potholes. However none of this will be quick. Labour\u2019s infrastructure overhaul is based on a 10-year plan. Shifting priorities Is the UK really doing that badly or have travel trends shifted, post-pandemic? For Tom Jenkins, CEO of the European Tourism Organisation, it\u2019s the latter. \u201cI think the UK is doing perfectly well but we\u2019ll see more people going to [continental] Europe,\u201d he says of 2024, adding that there\u2019s \u201callegedly a slight plateau of American demand for the UK.\u201d Patricia Yates, CEO of VisitBritain, disagrees, saying that American visitors have \u201cdriven our recovery since the pandemic.\u201d Kayla Zeigner, owner of travel agency Destination Europe, says she is booking ever-more trips to the UK. But for Marcy Zyonse, owner of Live The Dream Travel, a luxury vacations company, the UK has been hit by changing post-pandemic travel trends. \u201cThe appetite for epic, culturally immersive travel has been so strong in the past couple of years,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople were starved for that. In the US, we didn\u2019t go beyond the Caribbean for a couple of years, so people are looking to do that Greece or Italy trip. We\u2019ve missed out on two or three years of travel, and I think the UK is too low down on the list.\u201d English-speakers want a more exotic experience, she says \u2013 starting with a foreign language. After all, the UK is known for history, culture and the royals \u2013 all of which will be around next year. It\u2019s easier to prioritize that for a much-needed Mediterranean break. And that heritage has also meant the outgoing government has let the tourism industry slide, says Yates. \u201cThere\u2019s a view that we have enormous strength in our culture and heritage, and people will just come,\u201d she says. \u201cThat isn\u2019t the case. Like every export industry, we have to pitch \u2013 to tell people why they should come now. The balance of being a history and heritage destination is that it was there 10 years ago and will be there in 10 years.\u201d There\u2019s also a hangover from the pandemic, when UK travel rules were particularly chaotic, say experts. Destinations that opened early got visitors raving about their first post-lockdown trips \u2013 which had a knock-on effect. \u201cCurrent hotspots are destinations that opened early in 2021 to American tourists, which created a huge surge in demand,\u201d says Zeigler. Zyonse agrees. \u201cYou guys in the UK were behind, and people lost confidence. People booking in 2021 for 2022 didn\u2019t book the UK, and the effect snowballed. Social media has driven people to those places [that opened up earlier].\u201d Making Britain \u2018great\u2019 again So what\u2019s to be done? For Yates, the new government could use tourism as an economy-booster \u2013 to the tune of 7% growth every year, she says, according to VisitBritain\u2019s projections. \u201cThe strength of tourism is that you can dial up quickly \u2013 we don\u2019t need to build lots of infrastructure,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a case of promoting the right places at the right time to the right customers.\u201d Promotion is tricky in itself. The outgoing Conservative government was infamous for its \u201causterity\u201d cuts to public spending. In evidence to parliament in March 2024, VisitBritain revealed that its marketing budget was around \u201c\u00a318 million ($23 million) annually, compared to over 80 euros million ($85.5 million) for Ireland.\u201d Back in November 2021, Yates told CNN that VisitBritain didn\u2019t know what its budget would be from March 2022. Today, she explains, it has a \u00a319.8 million core budget, and gets around the same amount from another government campaign. That\u2019s still around half of Ireland\u2019s budget \u2013 so private-sector funding is used to boost it. \u201cWe know that for every \u00a31 invested we get \u00a315 spent by tourists \u2013 a slice goes to the treasury, and money goes directly from international visitors into the economy. It\u2019s a win-win,\u201d she says. But she\u2019s keen for the new government to help take things further. \u201cTourism delivers over three million jobs, around 10% of the economy,\u201d she says. \u201cTo have a real growth plan, we have to make a statement about Britain overseas that will drive visitors and investment.\u201d Welcoming visitors Not many tourists will have cared about political instability \u2013 as Zeigler says, \u201cAmericans are dealing with our own political chaos.\u201d But Yates says that what does cut through is \u201cthe message of welcome.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s hugely important as a driver for international visitors,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes Britain has done that well, like during the London Olympics. Sometimes we don\u2019t score as well. We need to look at how we position Britain as a welcoming destination, and how we look at borders and visas.\u201d In the 2023 Anholt-Ipsos Nation Brands Index, which ranks 60 nations on a range of attributes, the UK received its lowest ever rating for \u201cWelcome.\u201d Its rankings for \u201cCulture\u201d and \u201cPeople\u201d also dropped, though overall it rose two places to fourth position. A visa for a Chinese visitor to the UK lasts a year, but costs the same about as a 10-year visa to the US, she says. Marcus Lee, CEO of China Travel Online says that visa efficiency is one of the top three drivers for Chinese tourists. Visitors from the Gulf states have increased since the UK introduced a speedy \u201celectronic travel authorization\u201d scheme to fast-track their applications, says Yates. The scheme was due to expand to Europe and US markets \u2013 it will now be up to the Labour government to do so. Meanwhile the self-styled \u201chostile environment\u201d towards immigration of the last government hasn\u2019t helped either. \u201cFor tourism, we want an efficient and effective border, but we do want people to come,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need to think about language.\u201d She says that people who visit the UK on vacation are 18% more likely to invest in the country \u2013 and investment is something the new government will be looking for. Brexit side effects As a result of Brexit, in 2021 the UK government abolished tax-free shopping for non-EU citizens. It means the UK is now the only European country not offering tax-free shopping to visitors from outside the continent. Data from London retail promoter New West End Company in February showed that although visitor numbers in 2023 to the area were just 4% below 2019 levels, spending was down 19%. Visitors from the Gulf states \u2013 some of the wealthiest tourists to grace the UK \u2013 were up 20% on 2019 figures, yet they only spent 10% more. The pattern was repeated with tourists from across the globe. US tourists were up 8% but spent 14% less. In Italy and Spain, however, US spending was up by 143% and 179% respectively. \u201cThe impact of losing tax-free shopping is clear to see,\u201d says Dee Corsi, chief executive of the NWEC. \u201cWhile the UK strives to return to pre-pandemic levels of travel and spend, continental Europe\u2019s recovery continues at pace. \u201cWhilst the likes of Italy and France are actively leveraging tax-free shopping as a driver of growth, British businesses continue to trade at a disadvantage. With domestic spend remaining squeezed, a continued decline of tourist spending will have a knock-on effect on employment rates, inward investment, and supply chains across the nation.\u201d She calls bringing back tax-free shopping a \u201crare, golden opportunity for the government to\u2026 inject a shot of growth back into the economy, with a tried-and-tested scheme and a captive audience.\u201d \u201cWe would urge the new government to grasp this opportunity with both hands,\u201d she adds. Meanwhile, EU citizens now need a passport to visit the UK, where pre-Brexit they could cross the border with their ID cards. In 2021, Jenkins told CNN that three-quarters of Europeans don\u2019t have passports. Then there are clouds on the horizon regarding getting in and out. When the new ETIAS scheme launches, every traveler entering the Schengen area for the first time will need their biometric data captured. \u201cIt\u2019ll be time consuming initally,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s evidence that really bad entry systems deter people.\u201d \u2019Bridgerton\u2019 to the rescue? So what can be done? For Zyonse, VisitBritain should spend that marketing budget on attracting influencers and travel advisors to lesser-known destinations. A self-declared lover of the UK, who calls London \u201ca better version of New York,\u201d she says that the post-pandemic drive for more \u201cepic\u201d adventures calls for a different approach. Timelapse videos of an elevator going up London\u2019s Shard skyscraper, or something more wild in the Lake District, could attract social media likes, she says. She also thinks that the \u201cmajority\u201d of US family trips are driven by children\u2019s choices. She just went to Greece to give her daughter a \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d experience, and says that the UK \u201cneeds to get young girls posting on social media wearing a crown, or having afternoon tea, or doing something \u2018Bridgerton\u2019-related.\u201d She\u2019ll approve of VisitBritain\u2019s next big campaign, then. Launching at the end of 2024, \u201cStarring Great Britain\u201d will revolve around filming locations, says Yates, who adds that her team also wants to promote cheaper, out-of-season travel. For Yates, the new government offers a chance to grow the industry. But she warns that the UK needs to revamp its international reputation, wishing for it \u201cto be seen internationally as a welcoming, culturally diverse, vibrant country that people want to visit, send their kids to school and invest in.\u201d With the new government promising change from day one, it might not be long until she sees her dreams coming true.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/uk-tourism-drop-visitor-numbers-election/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "travel"}}

According to CNN affiliate BFMTV, around 500 spectators watched the inauguration of the blades on Friday evening, welcoming the installation with thunderous applause. Jean-Victor Clerico, General Manager of Moulin Rouge Paris, said that the aim was to reinstall the blades before July 15, when the Olympic flame passes the venue on its way to the opening of the Summer Games. About 20 can-can dancers performed to celebrate the installation, BFMTV reported, adding that, right now, the windmill\u2019s blades do not turn, as mechanical works couldn\u2019t be completed before the inauguration date. It is unclear why the windmill\u2019s sails fell off the iconic dancehall back in April. Then, the venue said that it had ruled out any \u201cmalicious act\u201d and Paris\u2019 fire department told BFMTV that nobody had been injured. Shows continued while the blades were missing.

{"id": "travel_article_breakfast-tacos-origins-mexico-texas", "text": "Two simple words can spark mouth-watering bliss or a series of blistering retorts in Texans: Breakfast tacos. In the Lone Star State, who gets the credit for these morning tortilla sensations can be a matter of haba\u00f1ero-hot debate. A highly contested Eater article in 2016 helped start a full-on Breakfast Taco War between Austin and San Antonio. While that particular battle eventually settled down, flare-ups continue. But to get a true picture of this simple food with a complex history, we must go beyond Texas and first look at another place: Mexico. Mouthwatering tacos in Monterrey The breakfast taco is actually part of a long parade of foods (pizza, for instance) whose fuzzy origins and various claims of authenticity spark ferocious debate. There\u2019s one thing we know for darn sure: Today, breakfast tacos are enjoyed on both sides of the Rio Grande River. In her CNN \u201cSearching for Mexico\u201d series, actor Eva Longoria traveled to Monterrey in the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n.     There, she enjoyed a breakfast taco with Mexican food bloggers Gerardo Alvarado and Ernesto Esquivel at Tacos Do\u00f1a Mary La Gritona, which has been serving central Monterrey for nearly 20 years.  \u201cThe breakfast taco may be the simplest of street food, but it\u2019s been been hitting the spot for the workers of Monterrey for nearly a century,\u201d narrates Longoria. \u2018Not a junkie food\u2019   CNN Travel caught up with Esquivel \u2013 born and raised in the border state of Sonora and resident of Monterrey for more than 10 years \u2013 to find out more. \u201cWhen I arrived in Monterrey, I discovered all the different types of tacos that everyone eats in the morning. You can have a taco of eggs. You can have a taco of meat. You can have a taco of potatoes.\u201d Esquivel describes breakfast tacos as \u201ca really fast food, but not a junkie food.\u201d  Esquivel said you can find breakfast tacos in other states in northern Mexico, but Monterrey and the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n are the culinary epicenter with more places to get them and a larger selection of fillings.  Some of the city\u2019s favorites are the machacado (dried beef) with eggs, the barbacoa (slow-cooked meat, often in a pit) and the deshebrada (shredded beef). In other words, you\u2019re in meat country. Timeline of the breakfast taco Esquivel said the breakfast taco goes back to the early 1900s and perhaps even earlier in Monterrey.  Compa\u00f1ia Fundidora, a former iron and steel foundry that dates to 1900 but is now a recreational and educational park, helped the breakfast taco get its start in Monterrey. Employees came \u201cto work really early, and so they had to have a really fast breakfast in the morning, and one fast breakfast in the morning is a breakfast taco.\u201d  And from there, the tacos spread into southern Texas, Esquivel said, which is reflected in the cuisine of today. \u201cI think the flavors here in Monterrey, mostly in the north, are similar to some flavors in Texas.\u201d Along with Do\u00f1a Mary\u2019s, he suggests these spots for a breakfast taco if you\u2019re in Monterrey: Tacos Rafa Ahogados, Tacos Piedra and Tony\u2019s Tacos. North of the Rio Grande   The river may mark a political line between two nations, but it has been no barrier at all to crossings of cuisine and culture. And Texas also shares a passion for the breakfast taco. You can tell that just from all the kerfuffles about them. \u201cNo Texas city can claim the breakfast taco,\u201d says Jos\u00e9 Ralat, the taco editor of Texas Monthly magazine. He places the ultimate credit south of the Rio Grande. \u201cIt comes from Mexico \u2013 where exactly, it\u2019s not really known. Geographically, the most likely source is northern Mexico. There is no literature that I have seen that can point to any particular city in northern Mexico.\u201d As for today, \u201cthey\u2019re popular in [the Mexican states of] Tamaulipas, Nuevo Le\u00f3n and Coahuila, which all border Texas,\u201d he said. Eddie Vega \u2013 who grew up in McAllen, across from the Mexican city of Reynosa in Tamaulipas state \u2013 is known as \u201cTaco Poet of Texas.\u201d He points out that historically, what\u2019s now south Texas was once part of Mexico.  Before 1836, \u201cthe border was further north. All this region was eating a combination of indigenous and Spanish food together.\u201d Vega said that growing up, breakfast tacos weren\u2019t some trendy food to him attracting attention from the likes of The New York Times and other coastal media. \u201cWhen you get to south Texas, and I\u2019m from the Valley, we had breakfast tacos, but they were in my house. My mom would make them. It\u2019s not something we\u2019d go to a restaurant to get because economically that region is very poor and nobody\u2019s eating out. Or not eating out in the morning especially.\u201d Enter Austin Ralat and Vega both said the breakfast taco was staple deep in south Texas and then San Antonio long before Austin got in on the action. So how did Austin become so synonymous with them? Austin has \u201ca great branding mentality, they have a knack for PR. Every year, Austin is flooded with coastal elites checking out South by Southwest,\u201d Ralat said. \u201cThey try some options, and then in their minds, they think it\u2019s an Austin thing. My job is to question the stuff \u2026 and let history speak for itself.\u201d  Ralat said San Antonio has \u201ca bit of an inferiority complex that they\u2019re often overlooked to the benefit of Austin when San Antonio is older, has more culture, it\u2019s more diverse, and the food is better.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, they\u2019re both Tex Mex towns, and breakfast tacos are Tex Mex. But they\u2019re also border food. When the Eater article came out\u201d \u2013 championing Austin as \u201chome\u201d of the breakfast taco \u2013 \u201cSan Antonians lost their minds.\u201d   Vega said the culinary history is too distant for any one place to stamp itself as originator or king purveyor. \u201cI don\u2019t know that one city \u2013 San Antonio, Corpus Christi, McAllen, Brownsville or Laredo \u2013 can claim it. You have differences with them because of ingredients.\u201d Movin\u2019 on Jessica Elizarraras, a Rio Grande Valley native and the executive producer for MySA.com, said many people have put the origins dispute behind them. \u201cI think at this point we\u2019ve mostly moved on from the great taco war of 2016,\u201d Elizarraras said in an email interview with CNN Travel. \u201cIs there occasional ribbing? Absolutely! Are there great tacos across the state? 1000 percent. The Mexican diaspora is far-reaching and so are their tacos.\u201d She cites a 2016 article by Gustavo Arellano as a detailed settlement of the issue that effectively shows Austin is not the start of the breakfast taco.  She also points out the regional differences within Texas. \u201cA flour tortilla in San Antonio tends to lean a bit puffier than its Rio Grande Valley/Coast counterparts. Con Huevos Tacos in San Antonio is the best of both worlds: a thin but sturdy tortilla, filled with fun, flavorful combinations.\u201d They\u2019ve gone nationwide   Ralat said he\u2019s now seeing breakfast tacos coast to coast. He was also recently in Nashville and saw them offered there.  \u201cI hesitate to eat them at a place that calls them Austin-style. \u2026 I want the food to be high quality. I don\u2019t want it to be spin.\u201d  Elizarraras suggests people just enjoy them \u2013 with or without huevos (eggs).  \u201cBreakfast tacos are ephemeral as they come, which makes them that much more magical,\u201d she said. \u201cBean and cheese is a great example of a breakfast taco that doesn\u2019t have eggs. \u2026 Chicharron en salsa (verde or rojo) is another example of a tasty taco that doesn\u2019t require eggs. Barbacoa \u2013 made using a whole cow-head, and more generally, beef cheeks \u2013 is a classic breakfast taco in San Antonio, often paired with Big Red [soda] for a Sunday morning treat.\u201d  The joy of it all In the end, why does the origin of a type of food even matter? \u201cPart of the issue is erasure. Just like with anything else in our Mexican-American culture, to feel left out of a conversation when you know you\u2019ve part of that conversation for a long time.\u201d Vega said. And back south of the Rio Grande, they are a source of unity, Esquivel said.  \u201cI think the breakfast tacos here in Monterrey \u2026 and the northeast of the country is something that unites everyone.\u201d  They\u2019re popular with the poor, the middle class and the rich, he said. \u201cThe place can be ugly. The place can be like in the streets. But you will see people in suits there eating breakfast tacos.\u201d  For Ralat, breakfast tacos are much more than a great way to start the morning. \u201cI think history, especially food history, is important to know because it provides another mirror for our culture. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to me that tortillas are the foundation of Mexican culture, and to break bread with someone is a sacred act. So let\u2019s take it literally, and say that you share tacos with someone else. That\u2019s so nice. And it\u2019s just so joyful.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/article/breakfast-tacos-origins-mexico-texas/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_travel_bolivia-cuisine-top-restaurants-dishes", "text": "Bolivia doesn\u2019t seem like an obvious foodie destination. But the big, landlocked South American country is making waves in the culinary world via top-notch restaurants and transforming foodways pioneered by the ancient Inca and Aymara peoples into modern fusion dishes. Capital city La Paz boasts three eateries \u2014 Gustu, Ancestral and Phayawi \u2014 currently ranked among the top 100 restaurants in Latin America. And more are waiting in the wings. And it\u2019s not just La Paz. Bolivia\u2019s food revolution has also spread to major cities such as Sucre as well as the Uyuni Salt Flats. The new Bolivian cuisine kicked off about a decade ago, according to Marsia Taha, head chef at Gustu. \u201cThere was a generation of new chefs that had a mindset that we should be proud about our identity and our culture and our food,\u201d Taha said. Taha and other likeminded chefs in La Paz coalesced around the concept of \u201czero-kilometer cuisine\u201d \u2014 using as many ingredients as possible that are raised or grown locally and having direct contact with the ranchers or farmers that provide those things. \u201cBy showing that we believe in local products, we were able to show people that Bolivian cuisine could be as great as things coming from outside the country,\u201d adds Sebasti\u00e1n Gim\u00e9nez, chef and co-owner of Ancestral. Revolutionizing Bolivian cuisine It\u2019s not surprising that Gustu has been counted among the continent\u2019s elite dining destinations since first opening its doors in 2013. Co-founder Claus Meyer is a Danish culinary legend who helped pioneer the New Nordic food movement at the Michelin three-star Noma restaurant in Copenhagen, and Gustu is always mentioned among the continent\u2019s top restaurants. Merging Bolivia\u2019s traditional ingredients and food culture with the contemporary Nordic model, Taha and Meyer fashioned a gastronomic melting pot that truly lives up to its name (gustu means \u201cdelicious\u201d in the Quechua language of the Andes). Among the signature dishes are raw Lake Titicaca trout with mango; llama with Amazonian vanilla and ajipa root; Amazon fish with goldenberries and a fermented yuca (cassava); and an out-of-this-world lamb tamale. Taha says that even after a decade in business, she and Gustu\u2019s other chefs are able to keep the concept fresh by traveling around Bolivia to learn about new ingredients and foodways. \u201cLearning how people cook, how they grow their food, and so on. We also give a lot of liberty to our chefs to bring in new ideas.\u201d Variations on the theme Located in the trendy Achumani neighborhood on the south side of La Paz, Ancestral occupies a cozy basement location with floor-to-ceiling windows looking out on a sunken garden. The food is new Bolivian with Basque and Nordic undertones, but the concept is open fire or parrilla-style cooking that revolves around the wood-stoked grill and oven. \u201cWe\u2019re inspired by the biodiversity of Bolivia,\u201d says chef Sebasti\u00e1n Gim\u00e9nez. \u201cWe have jungle, valleys, altiplano, and very high places. We are also inspired by local products and local techniques. We only use Bolivian products, and we only serve Bolivian wines.\u201d But don\u2019t expect traditional Andean or Amazon dishes. Ancestral offers a delicious fusion of old and new in offerings such as the chulet\u00f3n ribeye steak, trout ceviche with grilled corn and sweet potato, and porchetta pork roast with Bolivian tubers and red aji sauce. Manq\u2019a takes another tack. Rather than fine dining, the ambience is decidedly casual, the tables spread across three floors of an old wooden townhouse in the boho Sopocachi neighborhood of central La Paz. It\u2019s especially busy at lunch, a mixed bag of local shoppers, politicians, students and the occasional tourist savoring dishes such as sopa de man\u00ed (peanut soup), gratinated cheese and native potatoes with humacha sauce, soft baked keper\u00ed beef from eastern Bolivia, and surubi catfish from the Amazon served with quinoa, tucupi cassava and edible flowers. Food of the devil The chefs at these top-shelf restaurants don\u2019t have to look far for basic ingredients. Many of the building blocks of their fusion foods are native to the Andes valleys and foothills that extend all the way along Bolivia\u2019s western side from Lake Titicaca to Argentina. More than 4,000 potato types are cultivated in Bolivia and its Andean neighbors, many of them found in just a single, small valley. They come in various shapes, sizes, colors and slightly different flavors. Even more than spuds, Bolivians cherish their quinoa. The country boasts more than 3,100 varieties of quinoa, which contrary to popular opinion is actually the seed of a flowering pseudocereal plant rather than a true grain. An exhibit at the new visitor center in the silver mining town of San Crist\u00f3bal points out that Spanish conquistadors and padres considered quinoa the \u201cfood of the devil\u201d and banned its consumption as a way to control the local indigenous people. Five centuries later, NASA declared quinoa \u201cthe perfect food to grow in indoor greenhouses\u201d during long voyages in outer space because of its resistance to adverse conditions (such as growing in the Andes), versatility and high protein content. No longer vilified as Satan\u2019s feast, it\u2019s also an ideal ingredient for Bolivia\u2019s new-wave cuisine. Zero-kilometer goes wider Sucre, the nation\u2019s judicial capital in south-central Bolivia, isn\u2019t as cosmopolitan as La Paz when it comes to food. But it\u2019s gradually catching up. Located across the street from the city\u2019s Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe, Joy Ride Cafe was founded as a tourist restaurant but evolved into a local hangout for date nights, after-work parties and Sucrense craving burgers, pasta and other global eats. But right down the block is the fusion fare of El Solar. The seven-course degustation menu features dishes such as seafood rice flavored with Amazonian citrus juice, pork belly with pepper sauce and a creamy puree made from plantain and yuca; and beef loin with charque (llama jerky). All of this for 80 bolivianos (roughly $12). Located in southwest Bolivia about 300 miles (500 kilometers) south of La Paz, the otherworldly Salar de Uyuni is the world\u2019s largest and most spectacular salt flat as well as Bolivia\u2019s top tourist attraction. Once upon a time, it was primarily a backpacker destination, but in recent years, more well-heeled travelers (and social media influencers) have sparked a transformation of the local dining scene. Tika restaurant at the Jardines de Uyuni Hotel looks ordinary from the outside, but the kitchen creates Andean-inspired dishes that easily match anything found in Bolivia\u2019s big cities. Chef Tania L\u00f3pez also uses the term \u201czero-kilometer cuisine\u201d to describe the menu at Tika. Among her signature dishes are a sun-dried, shredded llama jerky with local white cheese and a piquant yellow chili pepper sauce, bubbling k\u2019alaphurka corn soup, and lake trout filets in a basil pesto \u201clagoon\u201d with quinoa risotto. L\u00f3pez says one of the closest dishes at Tika to what the ancient Inca may have eaten is the llama potojchi. \u201cPreparation takes more time than beef,\u201d she explains of a succulent dish that resembles goulash. \u201cWe still do this in the traditional way from many centuries ago \u2014 heated on lava rocks.\u201d Dishes that the Incas never tasted \u2014 but would probably die for \u2014 are Tika\u2019s house-made desserts, in particular the quinoa and purple corn ice creams. Tika also does upscale takeaway, meals for a remote picnic that diners can enable on their own or via a 4x4 adventure with Hidalgo Tours, which sets up a table, chairs and bar at a remote location in the middle of the salt flat.\u00a0\u00a0 But that\u2019s not to say that Bolivia\u2019s food revolution has reached every nook and cranny. An hour boat ride from the mainland in the middle of Lake Titicaca, the Isla del Sol (Island of the Sun) is the legendary birthplace of Inca civilization and a place still deeply rooted in the Andean past. On its open-air terrace overlooking the water, the island\u2019s Tacana restaurant serves a traditional pachamanca lunch that includes llama, lake fish, potatoes, corn and other locally sourced dishes \u2014 not all that different than what the Inca rulers would have eaten during their pilgrimages to the island more than 500 years ago.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/travel/bolivia-cuisine-top-restaurants-dishes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_canada-dream-supersonic-bomber-avro-arrow", "text": "It was meant to be one of the most advanced aircraft of its era, dispatching the threat of Soviet nuclear bombers and making Canada a world leader in military aviation and engineering. The Avro Arrow, also known as the CF-105, had a lot resting on its wings. However, the dream turned into a nightmare when the program was canceled less than a year after the plane\u2019s first flight, and well before it entered into service. To this day, 65 years later, the Avro Arrow remains one of Canada\u2019s biggest collective regrets and still fuels public discourse, as recently unveiled documents have shed some light on exactly what happened to the doomed project. \u201cThis aircraft was completely Canadian,\u201d says Richard Mayne, chief historian of the Royal Canadian Air Force, \u201cand the performance markers during its development very much showed that it was at least on par with the most advanced designs of the time.\u201d \u201cWhen it got canceled, that was one of Canada\u2019s \u2019what if\u2019 moments,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe Arrow has still got a grip on our national psyche.\u201d Cold War threat The Avro Arrow was a direct response to the perceived threat from the Soviet Union, following the end of World War II, of bombers capable of flying over the Arctic and reaching North America with a nuclear payload. \u201cThe Royal Canadian Air Force put out a requirement in 1952 for an interceptor capable of Mach 2 speed and an altitude of 50,000 feet,\u201d Mayne tells CNN. \u201cThey needed something fast that had the range and the altitude to intercept these Soviet bombers as far north as possible, before they reached Canada.\u201d Aircraft manufacturer Avro Canada had just successfully put into service the CF-100 Canuck, a versatile twinjet fighter designed and built in Canada, and was tasked with developing a vastly more advanced version of it. It was an ambitious plan that came at a significant moment for Canada. \u201cThe country had emerged from the Second World War as a major player,\u201d says Mayne. \u201cWe had the third largest navy in the world, the fourth largest air force. But Canadian citizenship didn\u2019t actually exist until 1947 \u2013 Canada had just come of age.\u201d Development started in 1955, and in record time the first Arrow was rolled out to the public, on October 4, 1957 \u2013 the same day as the launch of the Sputnik I, the world\u2019s first artificial satellite, which marked the start of the space age. \u201cIt was a coincidence,\u201d says Mayne, \u201cbut a horrible one, because Sputnik demonstrated that you could put a nuclear payload on the rocket that sent it into orbit. And the Arrow wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything about intercontinental ballistic missiles.\u201d Dead on arrival Designed for a crew of two and sporting a \u201cdelta\u201d wing design and a white livery that gave it an elegant look, the Arrow was just under 78 feet long with a wingspan of 50 feet, making it comparatively larger than both its predecessor, the CF-100 Canuck, and the Phantom F4, a dominant American fighter plane that would enter service in 1961. It first flew on March 25, 1958, but by that time, Mayne says, strategic thinkers, senior military personnel and politicians already believed the world had entered a \u201cpush button\u201d warfare scenario, where the nuclear threat was restricted to long-range missiles, with interceptors and bombers no longer playing a dominant role. \u201cThat turned out to be false, because the bomber threat continued and it continues to this day, but that was the thinking at the time,\u201d says Mayne. The plane had lost relevance, and the ballooning costs of the project and the changing political climate did the rest. On February 29, 1959, Prime Minister John Diefenbaker canceled the program, and within weeks the five planes that had been built, along with most of the assembly line, were destroyed for fear that they could be the subject of Soviet espionage. As a result, thousands of jobs were lost and Avro Canada eventually collapsed entirely. \u201cIf the United Kingdom had bought some Arrows, that actually might have saved the program,\u201d says Mayne. \u201cBut with no foreign contracts, our country was too small to support such an advanced technology. We were shooting for the stars, which is ironic because a lot of Avro engineers later went down to NASA and helped with the Apollo program.\u201d A life of its own Rumors and myths immediately began to swirl around the reasons for the abrupt cancellation of the program, some of which persist to this day. \u201cThe aircraft has taken on almost a mythological standing in Canada,\u201d says Alan Barnes, a senior fellow at Ottawa\u2019s Carleton University who has looked at the role played by intelligence in the decision to stop the plane\u2019s development. One set of myths, according to Barnes, essentially blames the United States for misleading Canada on the shifting Soviet threat, supposedly because they didn\u2019t want Canada to produce an aircraft that would have been better than American ones. Another says Canadian intelligence analysts deliberately misconstrued information to support a decision that the government had essentially made, providing an excuse for it. \u201cBut all of this was speculation, as nobody had actually seen the intelligence reports,\u201d he says. But in 2023, Barnes published a paper on those reports, after retrieving archival documents that show a clear link between the intelligence and how it was used by those in charge at the time. \u201cAt the beginning, the air force really didn\u2019t pay any attention to intelligence,\u201d he tells CNN. \u201cThey decided they wanted a big new fancy plane, so they came up with all the operational requirements largely in isolation, without really paying attention to what the reports were saying.\u201d By the late 1950s, he adds, the Arrow arrow was getting very expensive and quite delayed. \u201cCanadian intelligence produced a very high quality assessment in early 1958, saying the bomber threat was nowhere near as serious as previously thought, and that the Soviets weren\u2019t building up a massive bomber force, and were likely to shift their production and research into missiles,\u201d says Barnes. The policy implication was that if a threat was being reduced, there was very little reason to be spending so much money on an aircraft that wouldn\u2019t be able to deal with the ballistic missiles. \u201cBy the summer of 1958, the Chiefs of Staff Committee had come to the conclusion that they could no longer recommend continuing with the program, but didn\u2019t want to cancel it right then because of the political impact,\u201d says Barnes. \u201cThey sort of delayed things into early 1959, when it was still seen publicly as a disaster for Canadian industry as well as a political scandal. The government did what they needed to do, but it blew up in their face. They lost the election a couple of years later, to a certain extent on these defense issues.\u201d According to Barnes, the aircraft was never as good as people made it out to be. \u201cIt was canceled at just the right time to maintain this kind of mythology,\u201d he says. \u201cIt never flew with any of its armaments and the actual engines that it was designed to use. Everything was potential, so many Canadians can still pretend that this would have been the best aircraft in the world.\u201d Enduring impact In 1997, the CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) commissioned a TV miniseries about the plane titled \u201cThe Arrow\u201d starring Dan Aykroyd as Crawford Gordon, president of Avro Canada. A full-size wooden model of the aircraft was built for the production and is currently in the archives of the Reynolds Museum in Wetaskiwin, Alberta. Another model, made of aircraft-grade aluminum, is on display at the Edenvale Airport near Muskoka, Ontario. A third model, about two-thirds the size of a real Arrow, is under construction at Springbank Airport in Calgary \u2013 but this one is meant to actually fly. It\u2019s the passion project of a group of engineers who are hoping to take it to the skies by 2026. Although none of the actual Arrows have survived intact, the original cockpit and nose gear of one of them as well as parts of the wings of another are on display at the Canada Aviation and Space Museum in Ottawa. Perhaps the strongest indication of Canada\u2019s obsession with the Arrow came in 2018, when after a year of searching, sunken Arrow models were recovered from the bottom of Lake Ontario. The models were fired across the lake as part of flight tests in the mid-1950s, and numerous groups had been looking for them before without success. The endeavor was funded out of pocket by John Burzynski, a Canadian mining businessman. \u201cThe significance of finding the models lies in reminding Canadians of the great effort that went into designing, testing, building and flying an advanced technological aircraft, all done in a short six-year timeframe,\u201d Burzynski says, adding that among the pieces discovered was one of the very first test models, substantially intact, which is now on display at the Canadian Aviation and Space Museum in Ottawa. Speaking of the importance and role of the Arrow in Canadian history, Burzynski says that everything was possible to the generation that followed World War II, and the world was changing quickly. \u201cThe massive effort that went into the Arrow program was essentially a live exercise, showing that anything is possible when enough effort and ingenuity is applied to a problem,\u201d he says. \u201cTo many it seems that this would have been an inflection point for Canada to develop both a vigorous air and possibly even space program, had it not been abruptly canceled.\u201d CORRECTION: An earlier headline on this story mischaracterized the Avro Arrow. It was an interceptor aircraft.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/canada-dream-supersonic-bomber-avro-arrow/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_travel_denali-national-park-riley-wildfire", "text": "No date has been set for the reopening of a popular national park in Alaska after a rare active wildfire near the park\u2019s entrance was reported Sunday, officials said. Evacuation orders were issued for\u00a0Denali National Park and Preserve on Monday as crews began battling the Riley Fire, park officials said on\u00a0Facebook. Since then, the park has been closed, and it has no timeline for a reopening, park officials told CNN Tuesday. \u201cPark tour and transit bus service will remain suspended on Wednesday, July 3,\u201d the park posted late Tuesday. \u201cPark campgrounds will close at 11:00am on Wednesday.\u201d The wildfire had burned 388 acres and was 25% contained as of Tuesday evening, park officials said. But a bit of good news emerged Wednesday morning: \u201cCloudy skies and cooler temperatures are aiding firefighters and water-dropping aircraft,\u201d park officials said. \u201cHelicopters are able to maneuver through the Nenana River corridor to draw water from a nearby lake to make numerous water drops on the fire.\u201d More than 600,000 people visit the park every year, with most visiting in the summer, according to the National Park Service. Meanwhile, employees who were forced to evacuate from park housing are staying in the nearby town of Healy, the park said. The fire is extremely rare for that area because an active fire hasn\u2019t been there for 100 years, park officials told CNN. Although it hasn\u2019t caused any injuries or structural damage as of Tuesday, the Riley Fire is affecting local air quality conditions, park officials said. The blaze ignited as the nation grapples this week with more\u00a0extreme heat\u00a0\u2013 the deadliest form of weather globally and\u00a0one that makes wildfires more likely and destructive. Additional crews arrived at the Alaska preserve\ufeff on Tuesday to help combat the fire, according to park officials. Cloudy skies and cooler temperatures are aiding firefighters, the Bureau of Land Management\u2019s Alaska Fire Service said Tuesday on the state\u2019s interagency wildfire information website. \u201cThe fire has already burned through most of the black spruce in the area. It is now burning mostly hardwoods and brush, which helped moderate fire behavior,\u201d the Alaska Fire Service said. \u201cThe winds, which are typically channeled through the Nenana River corridor, have been uncharacteristically calm since the Riley Fire started on Sunday.\u201d The cause of the fire is unknown, and a fire investigator will be brought in to investigate, park officials said. The Riley Fire is one of 33 large wildfires currently burning across Alaska, spanning almost 300,000 acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. The Alaska wildfire season typically begins in late May and ends in late July, according to the National Park Service. On average,\u00a01 million acres burn statewide\u00a0every year, the park service says. \u201cPeak fire season period is now underway in Alaska, and conditions are expected to worsen under persisting and recurrent hot, dry air masses, combined with the long daylight period,\u201d the National Interagency Fire Center said Tuesday.

{"id": "travel_eat-until-youre-bankrupt-japan-osaka", "text": "Let\u2019s be honest. Osaka hasn\u2019t got Tokyo\u2019s mind-bending urban sprawl, where every turn opens up a world of adventure. Likewise, it lacks the historic temples, tree-covered hills and ancient history of Kyoto. What it does have, though, are two of the biggest draws any visitor to Japan could ask for. The best food anywhere in the country. And the people, who are funky, fun and playful. This is a place to come and eat, enjoy the odd local brew and take in a city where day-to-day pleasures come to the fore unlike anywhere else. Food is practically a religion in Osaka, which is now anticipating the global spotlight as it gears up to host Expo 2025. It is known as the kitchen of Japan, and, for foodies, any tour of its myriad culinary delights must start in Dotonbori. The streets along either side of the Dotonbori Canal, between the D\u014dtonboribashi Bridge and Nipponbashi Bridge, in the city\u2019s Namba district, are the place to spend a gut-busting afternoon. You\u2019ll know you\u2019re in the right place when you see restaurants adorned with huge, moving mechanical crabs and octopus models looming above, demanding you come inside and eat. Octopus is, unquestionably, the main ingredient here, the essential part of Osaka\u2019s great gift to Japan: takoyaki. Dough balls filled with diced octopus, fried until blisteringly hot, they can be picked up for on-the-go snacking wherever you turn. However, as Tokyo-based CNN producer Junko Ogura says, these are not for eating in one go. \u201cIt\u2019s really hot,\u201d she says. \u201cJust be careful. Not the whole thing!\u201d Of course, few tourists can resist this approach, even if it does leave them with a scorched mouth. Takoyaki is, however, just the start. As Junko explains, Osakans even have a saying for their food-based obsessions. \u201cKuidaore.\u201d It basically means: \u201cEat in Osaka like you\u2019re going to go bankrupt.\u201d That goes for easing succulent crab meat from its shell with chopsticks and dining on ultra-fresh sushi, with chefs working their magic and handing you the result to wolf down immediately. On Sennichimae Doguyasuji \u2013 aka \u201ckitchen shopping street\u201d \u2013 you can pick up the finest Japanese knives and cooking equipment, so you can continue to craft your own dishes back home. \u2018You look healthy, I love you\u2019 There is, though, one dish that you\u2019ll need to set aside a chunk of change for. Something so succulent and delicious that it has become renowned the world over. Kobe beef. Readily available in Dotonbori and across Osaka, this delicacy\u2019s reputation precedes it. This is meat reared to the most exacting standards, with prices to match. A kilo of Kobe grade 11 sirloin can go for $300 or more. Boarding a Shinkansen bullet train from the heart of Osaka, you can be in Kobe in just half an hour. The cows are raised just outside the city under strict conditions. Those who\u2019ve been in Japan for less than seven days cannot come into contact with them. In fact, to speak with a farmer involved in their care requires CNN\u2019s Junko to call them via Zoom. When asked how the cattle are treated compared with other cows, the farmer is effusive in his explanation. \u201cHe [touches] them as much as possible, talks to them and says, \u2018you look cute, you look healthy, I love you,\u2019\u201d says Junko, translating the farmer\u2019s words. If that seems out there, you can add in the well-worn fact that farmers massage and pet their cows. The farmer himself says that after three years of care, he is sad to see his charges head off to be slaughtered, but is happy in the knowledge that they provide happiness to those who eat them. Succulent, and with a melt-in-the-mouth texture, Kobe beef is arguably the best on Earth, a cornerstone of any foodie outing in Osaka. Let\u2019s all go to the ball game After all that food, a spot of exercise tends to be the order of the day. Like so many parts of Japan, Osaka is obsessed with baseball. The game has been a fixture in this part of the world since it was first introduced in 1872. Today, baseball is played by all ages, from kids in little league right through to octogenarians enjoying a pick-up game on a summer afternoon. It\u2019s as much about watching as it is playing, however. The local team is the Hanshin Tigers, one of the most storied baseball franchises in Japan. The club began life in 1936 and briefly played as the Osaka Tigers, before reverting to Hanshin, the city 20 minutes west, where it plays at Koshien Stadium. Long seen as an underdog, the Tigers won the Japan Series in 2023, breaking a 38-year hoodoo called \u201cThe Curse of the Colonel,\u201d believed to have been caused by overly excited fans throwing a statue of KFC legend Colonel Sanders into the Dotonbori Canal when they last won the title 1985. Hardcore fans attend every game, including Takada, a local man who spells out his priorities while sitting in the bleachers waiting for a rain-delayed game to get going. \u201cHanshin Tigers number one,\u201d he says with a smile. \u201cHanshin Tigers. Then family. Then work or career.\u201d Takada says he wept when the Tigers won the pennant in 2023, hugging friends and crying so much that tears came out of his nose. Even today\u2019s game being called off can\u2019t dampen his spirits. A long soak If a love of nonstop action seems to be behind Osakans\u2019 fun and playful attitude, respite is at hand in the city\u2019s many marvelous onsens. These natural springs are part of a classic culture and require an etiquette all of their own. Tattoos must be covered, owing to body art being viewed historically in Japan as something that only adorned yakuza gangsters. Participants must be naked and are separated into men\u2019s and women\u2019s baths, ready for a wash and long soak at the end of a busy day at work. In the onsen, it\u2019s all about \u201cnaked friendship,\u201d a place where everybody is equal, much like the sauna cultures of Finland and Estonia. The beautiful countryside surrounding Osaka is full of them, but city center baths are easy to find too, making them an ideal spot to take time out and even meet a few local people \u2013 albeit without any clothes on. Osaka is, after all, a city of flavors and friendship. A place where you can eat royally and spend time doing so with people who are obsessed with the best food and making sure everyone receives the finest hospitality. It\u2019s on show in restaurants, ballparks and onsens, too. Somewhere you need to go all out and make peace with the fact you might go \u201cKuidaore.\u201d Tokyo and Kyoto may be the cities known for having it all in Japan. But it\u2019s important to always make time for Osaka.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/eat-until-youre-bankrupt-japan-osaka/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_best-towns-america-2024-intro", "text": "You\u2019ve elbowed into the Empire State Building, admired the architecture along the Chicago River and huffed and puffed up and down the streets of San Francisco. Big US cities have attractions in spades \u2014 and crowds, too. This summer, we\u2019re looking at smaller cities that aren\u2019t already at the top of everyone\u2019s travel list \u2014 places where you\u2019ll often find small-town vibes and loads of personality as well as plenty to see and do for a few days or more. At CNN Travel, we tapped our network of contributors for nominations for our inaugural list of America\u2019s Best Towns to Visit. We evaluated their favorites and winnowed the finalists to 10 by looking at each town\u2019s attractions, food and beverage offerings, nightlife and cultural scene, sense of identity, proximity to other interesting spots and wow factor. We also looked at travel essentials, including lodging options and the ease of getting there and around. Our choices range in size from about 50,000 residents to about 225,000. They\u2019re spread across the country and serve as a reminder of what\u2019s great about the United States: communities committed to making their towns better. You\u2019ll see that spirit in revitalized neighborhoods and downtowns and in residents who have put all their passion, creativity and know-how into endeavors that feed souls and bellies. Here are our 2024 picks: 10. Duluth, Minnesota High scores: Cool lakeside setting, outdoor activities, beverage scene A small city best known over the years as an industrial, ore-shipping port on the Great Lakes, Duluth is now gaining a reputation as a refuge from the climate crisis. Its summers are typically quite temperate thanks to its setting alongside Lake Superior. The hilly city offers plenty of outdoor activities, a great beer scene, a cluster of lakeside attractions and a revitalized neighborhood showcasing handmade goods. You can join friendly Duluthians in a community sauna followed by a dip in cool Amity Creek. 9. Knoxville, Tennessee High scores: Down-to-earth vibe, live music, outdoor access You may know Knoxville as home of the University of Tennessee and its orange-and-white tsunami of fandom during sports events. Or you may know it as the host of the 1982 World\u2019s Fair and its distinctive glass tower. But did you know this eastern Tennessee city also offers a burgeoning music scene (watch out Nashville and Memphis!), delightful classic theaters and delicious eats? And there\u2019s a 1,500-acre Urban Wilderness for easy access to outdoor adventure. 8. Grand Rapids, Michigan High scores: Art and design, beer scene, outdoor activities With a world-class sculpture park and public art all over town, Grand Rapids is far more than \u201cBeer City USA.\u201d But with more than 100 breweries, distilleries and cideries, Michigan\u2019s second-largest city comes by its beverage moniker honestly. Museums showcase Grand Rapids\u2019 deep design roots, while the Grand River nods to its family-friendly outdoor assets. And a planned amphitheater along the river\u2019s banks is just part of a bigger waterfront revitalization effort. 7. Macon, Georgia High scores: Musical heritage, cultural attractions, architecture With museums and a revived studio dedicated to its musical heritage, Macon scores high on cultural attractions and the sorts of local institutions that remain beloved for generations. Macon\u2019s revitalized downtown has made way for new restaurants, bars and a boutique hotel. And with a push to turn a site holding thousands of years of history into Georgia\u2019s first US national park and preserve co-managed by the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, the city is paying attention to how its earliest history speaks to its future. 6. Flagstaff, Arizona High scores: Dark skies, outdoor activities, scenery, retro vibe Sunny days and starry nights are big draws in this high-elevation city.

{"id": "travel_the-end-of-off-season-travel-cmb", "text": "It might be an impossible task to find a traveler who loves crowds and long lines. However, they\u2019re part of the price that most tourists have to pay to visit some of the world\u2019s most famous attractions, especially during peak times. It used to be that someone looking for a bargain could count on traveling in the shoulder or low season \u2013 for example, Italy was once more affordable in the fall, while Hong Kong was cheaper in the boiling-hot summer months. But the pandemic threw a lot of this conventional travel wisdom out the window. Many offices and schools switched to online-only, which provided people a rare opportunity to spend long periods away from home. Some companies kept those remote working policies after the pandemic ended, providing their workers with more opportunities to explore the world while still drawing a paycheck. All that tourism, though, comes with consequences. Practically every day there\u2019s a new headline about efforts to combat overtourism, such as new hotel bans in Amsterdam, photo-blocking barricades in Japan and mass protests in the Canary Islands. According to the United Nations, global travel  will return to pre-pandemic levels in 2024 \u2013 and could go higher. That, in turn, begs a question: Is there such a thing as an off-season anymore? \u201cOn the one hand, global travel is getting busier and busier,\u201d explains Olivier Ponti, a director at ForwardKeys, a Spain-based travel data and analysis company. \u201cThere are still some peak seasons and those peak seasons remain really busy, but the low seasons are getting busier and busier as well.\u201d Recently, ForwardKeys crunched some numbers in three of the world\u2019s most popular beach destinations: Thailand, Hawaii and the Maldives. Here\u2019s the math: take the total number of tourists in a year and divide that figure by 12, which works out to an average of 8% per month. Then, you can plot a graph to see which months are higher and lower than that total to determine when the peak season is. \u201cIn Thailand, low season typically spans from April to September with April and May being really hot,\u201d says Ponti. \u201cDuring this low season the tourist volumes each month constitute more than 7% of the annual total. That means very, very little seasonality.\u201d In other words? \u201cThere is no off-season anymore in a place like that.\u201d The climate change effect Arguably the biggest single factor affecting what we know as \u201cpeak season\u201d travel is weather. \u201cA lot of people tend to assume that the low season is defined as the time of the year when the weather is the crappiest,\u201d says Ged Brown, owner of the aptly-named tour company Low Season Traveller. But climate change is redefining what that \u201ccrappiest\u201d weather might be. A 2023 survey from the European Travel Commission reported that European travelers cited weather as their number-one factor in deciding where to go on vacation, with 8% of respondents saying they were concerned about extreme weather in European destinations. Heat waves in southern European countries like Italy, Spain and Greece caused a crisis last summer, with the trend only continuing upward. Multiple foreign tourists have gone missing or died amid extreme heat in Greece so far this season. More than 62,000 people died heat-related deaths in Europe in 2022, the continent\u2019s hottest summer on record. Following the devastating headlines, ForwardKeys\u2019 data shows an immediate spike in searches for summertime flights to northern European destinations like Denmark and Sweden. Mikey Sadowski, head of communications at tour organizer Intrepid Travel, says that the company has had to drop or reschedule some of its popular trips due to climate change. In Nepal, he says, there\u2019s an \u201cincrease of the monsoon season now. Snow is melting faster, the glaciers are melting faster, the water is running faster and routes that we normally could access before are no longer accessible. So we\u2019re actually having to shorten the [travel] seasons to avoid heavy monsoon time.\u201d Intrepid\u2019s own CEO canceled an Italian cruise with his mother because of hot weather concerns, Sadowski says. Beyond the thermostat Climate may be an important factor in booking a holiday, but it\u2019s not the only one. ForwardKeys\u2019 Ponti, himself a father of two, notes that many travelers have to plan their trips at the same time because they are working around school schedules. Some families choose to homeschool their children as a way to experience other parts of the world without being beholden to a schedule. The parents who opt to \u201cworldschool\u201d can travel during off-peak times \u2013 while also teaching their kids about different cultures. But every family\u2019s situation is different. For those whose kids are grown and out of the house or who don\u2019t have kids at all, there are more opportunities to be flexible when booking travel. Ann Woodward, a childfree American who has been living in Mexico for the past three years, makes a point of learning school schedules in her area so that she can plan around them. \u201cI am generally trying to not move, to not be on a plane, to not be on a bus, to not go to touristic attractions during those periods. I actually call it hiding,\u201d she laughs. Woodward, who has a pension from her last job in the US, can afford to travel for months at a time, preferring to choose one destination and rent an apartment rather than hop from place to place. For her, it\u2019s not just about saving money \u2013 it\u2019s about knowing her physical and emotional limits. \u201cI think that things that were acceptable and fun, even in my 20s and 30s, I can\u2019t handle anymore,\u201d she says. \u201cFor me, part of the past five years, I\u2019ve become much more focused on healing my nervous system. And I will say that I think I ignored it when I was living in New York, to be quite honest. I was ignoring a lot of cues from my body when I was living there when I was younger. So, whereas maybe an average person would be like, \u2018Wow, this park is really busy today,\u2019 or, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s lots of people in my photos,\u2019 I would just get there and turn around and leave. I just won\u2019t even engage.\u201d Still, Woodward acknowledges that she is in a privileged position. She spent much of her youth traveling and has already \u201cchecked off\u201d many of the big bucket list places that attract the most crowds, which means that she can now go to smaller towns and other less busy areas in addition to visiting during off-peak times. However, there are benefits from traveling during high seasons, especially when it comes to infrastructure. Some flights and train routes run more frequently \u2013 or only \u2013 during peak season. Travelers who go to less busy regions may find that shops and restaurants have more limited hours or close entirely when the flocks of visitors leave. Those without flexible schedules shouldn\u2019t feel like their future holds nothing but long, sweltering lines in overcrowded cities. Brown of Low Season Traveller puts together itineraries for adventurous travelers who are looking for a destination their friends haven\u2019t been to already \u2013 or those looking to get a less hectic experience at an old classic. \u201cIf your main purpose for travel is the most perfect weather, then yeah, you\u2019re going to pay a premium for that. And another premium that you\u2019re going to pay is the fact that it\u2019s going to be crowded and you\u2019re going to have to have queues and lines everywhere and find it difficult to get reservations and all of that kind of stuff,\u201d Brown says. \u201cFor me, the challenge is about finding the joy in those low seasons, finding those nuggets of gold.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/the-end-of-off-season-travel-cmb/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_termessos-turkey-hidden-ancient-mountaintop-city", "text": "Alexander the Great tried to conquer Termessos but failed. Today, the incredible deserted ruins of this once-powerful city, perched like a fortified eagle\u2019s nest high in the mountains of southwestern Turkey, can be conquered by anyone willing to make the hike up here. But few people ever do. Termessos stands empty. A spectacular archeological jewel, preserved in isolation, seen only by a few handfuls of people who make the trip from the beach resorts of nearby tourism hot spot Antalya. That\u2019s a shame for those who miss out. For those who do get to explore, it\u2019s a major bonus. They get to wander around one of Turkey\u2019s most impressive ancient cities all by themselves. It\u2019s a place of incredible atmosphere: history and landscape; views and silence; nature and destruction \u2013 all combining to create one of the Mediterranean\u2019s great unsung archaeological wonders. Here, slowly being swallowed by vegetation and worn down by time, are gigantic mausoleums, vast underground cisterns, temples, imposing city walls and a breathtaking theater perched, like Machu Picchu, on a hilltop that offers views stretching for miles all around. Despite its emptiness, Termessos is easy to reach. It only takes around 45 minutes to drive from Antalya\u2019s traffic-snarled downtown to the gates of Mount G\u00fcll\u00fck-Termessos National Park \u2013 a protected wildlife haven that surrounds the ruins. After paying a three-euro (about $3) gate fee at the park\u2019s entrance, visitors then face another 10-minute ride further into the pine and gorse-clad hills along a switchback road that reaches about 1,000 meters above sea level. Eventually the road emerges into what seems like an uninteresting parking lot with a public restroom. This was, in fact, at one time a giant agora, or marketplace for the city, which in its heyday 2,000 years ago would\u2019ve been bustling with traders and citizens. It\u2019s here where the Termessos adventure begins. And it begins with death. Tomb raiders Hidden by vegetation at one end of the agora are the stone-strewn remains of what was clearly once a grand street leading away along the hillside. Instead of houses or shops, this was lined with the tombs of Termessos\u2019 rich and mighty. Ancient sarcophagi carved with clues to who they once contained, like shields and spears for warriors, lie scattered. Some are small, others huge \u2013 offering clues to levels of wealth or power. Some are unfinished, their huge pedestals hinting at what would\u2019ve been. All of them have been broken into by raiders over the centuries, their walls smashed or lids prised off despite once being locked shut with metal clasps. Tree roots and ivy creepers have also snaked through the stonework. \u201cThe thieves working here were very good at their jobs,\u201d says \u00d6nder U\u011fuz, an Antalya-based art teacher and licensed guide who offers tours of Termessos, which he\u2019s been captivated by since first coming here as a student in 1996 (\u201cIt was love at first sight!\u201d). Reaching the heart of the ancient city involves an uphill hike along a leafy pathway that\u2019s a little rough and steep in places. Visitors here need to be equipped with sturdy footwear and OK with mildly strenuous hiking on tricky terrain. In summer, it\u2019s best to visit early before temperatures start to climb, and bring water. Soon the lower city walls loom into view \u2013 a first hint at how well-defended Termessos was when it was built perhaps around the fourth or fifth century BCE, long before the Romans showed up with the engineering skills that would transform the known world. Which raises the question: how did the people of Termessos do it? U\u011fuz laughs off the suggestion of any mystery here. We\u2019re too caught up in the achievements of our technological age to appreciate even the basic abilities of our distant ancestors, in his opinion. \u201cYou and I, we\u2019re nothing without our computers and social media accounts,\u201d he says (shortly after taking a snap for his own Instagram feed). \u201cTake those away and we are helpless. Not these people. They worked with stone for centuries. They had nothing else. Building things like this was what they knew how to do.\u201d The people of Termessos were known as Solyms, descendants of Luwians, an ancient civilization that was spread across what is now Turkey, but largely overlooked by archaeological scholars until the past few decades. To this day, little is known about the Solyms or when they constructed their city. But they clearly knew what they were doing. Their choice of location showed a genius for strategic thinking. Not only was it on a major trade route, enabling it to grow wealthy on goods and payments from people heading to and from the Mediterranean, its altitude and commanding views made it easy to defend. Which is why when Alexander the Great showed up around 333 BCE \u2013 when Termessos made its first real appearance in the history books \u2013 he was apparently unable to invade or blockade the city into surrender, despite multiple attempts. He reputedly called the city an \u201ceagle\u2019s nest.\u201d Later, the Romans had more success in controlling the city. Not through force, says U\u011fuz, but through more insidious means, like offering autonomy under Roman \u201cprotection.\u201d \u201cThe Romans were like the mafia,\u201d he suggests. Fight school Climbing higher up the hillside on a rocky path sprouting with fragrant wild sage, there\u2019s more evidence of how sophisticated life in Termessos would\u2019ve been. To the left, there\u2019s the marble ruins of the city\u2019s gymnasium, a kind of college campus for trainee soldiers, complete with bathhouse and refectory. Some of the main building is still intact, with indications that impressive arches once ran across its front wall. Inside were two floors, plus a subterranean vault for storage. In front is the palaestra, an area that would\u2019ve been used for wrestling and combat training and which today is littered with pieces of the gymnasium\u2019s terracotta roof tiles. It is, of course, mostly derelict. Termessos was believed to have been destroyed by an earthquake the exact date of which is not known, but possibly the 4th or 5th century. What remains is not the work of archeological reconstruction. It\u2019s the genuine state the building has been left in for the past 1,600 years. Here, the silence and emptiness of the place allow the imagination to wander \u2013 bringing those warriors back to life and allowing visualization of their mock battles in a place that has changed so little over time. Further up, the upper city walls give commanding views of the forest below and offer a good vantage point over anyone trying to sneak up for an invasion. Beyond them is more evidence of civilization. There are the remains of a covered water drainage system. And for a city that had few water sources, they are one of its most impressive assets \u2013 gigantic multi-chambered underground cisterns carved by hand into solid rock and lined with plaster. Capable of holding up to 1,500 tons of water, these cavernous containers would\u2019ve been vital to the survival of a city that had few natural sources of H2O \u2013 especially when Alexander the Great was mounting blockades. Today, they\u2019re filled with broken columns and other rubble, likely dumped there when the city was abandoned. There\u2019s speculation water shortages could\u2019ve been behind a decision to finally relocate the city elsewhere. Luxury shops Nearby, there\u2019s the imposing outer wall of the bouleuterion or assembly house that would\u2019ve been the city\u2019s seat of power, another central agora dating back to pre-Roman times and the ruins of a colonnaded street that once housed the city\u2019s most exclusive shops. \u201cThis is the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es of Termessos,\u201d says U\u011fuz. Like the Parisian upscale retail boulevard, this would\u2019ve been where the wealthy spent their cash, he explains. The finest olive oils, cloths, leather goods and items imported from all around the Mediterranean would\u2019ve been on sale here. These are all sideshows to the city\u2019s showstopper attraction: the theater After a last scramble over huge slabs of marble, the view opens up onto an epic panorama of the large performance space, perched on the city\u2019s highest point. The setting is breathtaking, with mountain ravines cascading away on either side. The sheer drop behind the theater\u2019s upper walls is dizzying. It\u2019s a reminder to be careful when exploring ruins that haven\u2019t been fenced off for safety. With room for about 4,000 people, the semi-circle of stone terraces faces the ruins of what would\u2019ve been a stage. The theater probably predated the arrival of the Romans, but was later updated along Roman lines. In Termessos, the location is particularly significant, as it sits opposite a mountain that was once sacred to the city\u2019s inhabitants. It\u2019s easy to see why this was such a hallowed spot, with views that, on haze-free days, stretch as far as the port of Antalya. And again, it\u2019s a place to sit and imagine what life was like nearly 2,000 years ago, when such theaters would\u2019ve been used by the Romans as, according to U\u011fuz, a propaganda tool - a soft force to keep their empire in check. As history lessons go, this is pretty spectacular. U\u011fuz (who can be contacted via email: onder.uguz@gmail.com) says he never tires of exploring Termessos. He also offers tours of other more popular archaeological sites in the area, but the tranquility and beauty of this hidden ancient wonder draw him back time and again. He particularly loves soaking in the vistas from the city\u2019s upper walls. \u201cUsually, I\u2019m sitting there with my wife, under a juniper tree in springtime, a beautiful blue sky with this great scenery,\u201d he says, adding that year-round, the solitude offered by Termessos is also an attraction. \u201cFor me it\u2019s perfect. Just you and nature; little squirrels and archaeology. The only thing missing is a cold beer.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/termessos-turkey-hidden-ancient-mountaintop-city/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "travel"}}

Matteo Salvini, Italy\u2019s deputy prime minister and minister of infrastructure and transport, announced the change on social media Friday, writing: \u201cGood news: Milan Malpensa airport will be named after Silvio Berlusconi.\u201d According to Salvini, officials from the Lombardy region where the airport is based put in a request to rename it a year ago. On Friday, the board of directors of the country\u2019s National Civil Aviation Authority approved it. \u201cThe final decision is up to the minister of infrastructure and transport and I am ready to put my final signature, with pride and emotion, in memory of my friend Silvio, a great entrepreneur, a great Milanese and a great Italian,\u201d Salvini said. \u201cHe is always with us.\u201d It is unclear when Malpensa, which offers flights to 180 destinations in 77 countries, will officially be renamed. CNN has reached out to MilanAirports, the company that owns Malpensa, for comment.

{"id": "travel_shohei-ohtani-japanese-tourism-los-angeles", "text": "Her nails are painted blue and white. There\u2019s a Dodgers logo on one nail, the number 17 on another. Takayo Hizume had gone to a nail salon at home in Japan to get them done, then flew about 10 hours to Los Angeles, spending a great deal \u2014 considering the weak yen \u2014 to stay several days in California. The effort is all for one person: Shohei Ohtani. The six-foot-four star hitter and pitcher has been drawing fans from across the Pacific for years. But with his\u00a0historic Dodgers contract, the influx of Japanese tourists has reached a fever pitch in Los Angeles\u00a0for\u00a0Ohtani\u2019s first season with the team. And he\u2019s not even pitching yet. Ohtani, who is\u00a0recovering from elbow surgery, is hitting this season but not expected to start pitching for the Dodgers until 2025. Still, a major Japanese travel agency told CNN it\u2019s now booking up to 200 clients from Japan at every Dodgers home game. And with 12 new Japanese sponsors, Japanese-language stadium tours and new Japanese menu items, the Dodgers are making the most of the Ohtani effect. Japan\u2019s \u2018son\u2019 When asked why she traveled halfway across the world to see a baseball game, Hizume said Ohtani feels like her own son. Hizume spoke in Japanese, while the general manager of the Miyako Hotel \u2013 where she was staying in Los Angeles \u2013 stood next to her and translated. Hizume explained that she felt a connection because her son played baseball, and she feels Ohtani is like Japan\u2019s son. Akira Yuhara, the general manager, said that this is a common sentiment among those in Japan, feeling as if Ohtani is representative of the best of the country\u2019s young men. \u201cPeople like Shohei\u2019s heart. He\u2019s [a] very honest person,\u201d Yuhara said. His honesty seemed cemented in fans\u2019 esteem after\u00a0federal investigators cleared him\u00a0in a recent sports betting scandal, in which his former interpreter pleaded guilty of swindling Ohtani out of $17 million. \u201cHe\u2019s just a phenomenal individual, right?\u201d said Judy Clow, who brought her brother from Japan to a Japanese-language tour at Dodger Stadium. \u201cWait till he starts pitching for us! My gosh!\u201d Some Japanese fans said they had traveled abroad to see him play before. Some had gone as far as South Korea, while others had made it to Southern California within the last few years when Ohtani played for the Los Angeles Angels, who are located southeast of LA in Anaheim. Some of the six new Japanese-language tour guides at Dodger Stadium actually worked at Angels Stadium previously, serving the same fans. Even when there is no home Dodgers game, groups of Japanese visitors gather at an empty Dodger Stadium for the chance to see the dugout, the field, the press box and championship trophies. Japanese-language tours are offered four days a week. Global flair for America\u2019s pastime In addition to Japanese-language tours, visitors find familiar flavors and ads as well. Christine Gerriets, executive chef at Dodger Stadium, said that the stadium offers all the traditional ballpark eats like Dodger dogs, as well as some new items, like chicken katsu sandwiches, sushi, Kurobuta pork sausages, and takoyaki, which are Japanese round fritters filled with octopus. \u201cWe had to put a little bit of LA flair to the takoyaki,\u201d Gerriets said, pointing out traditional and tempura flavors, alongside one with salsa and cheese, and another covered in guacamole. Mihana Hayashi, an Ohtani fan from Nagoya, Japan, said the guacamole and cheese takoyaki had great \u201cAmerican taste,\u201d perhaps symbolic of how being American often means blending global cultures. And celebrating \u201cAmerica\u2019s pastime\u201d involves welcoming throngs of global fans. Hayashi and her sister had traveled to see Ohtani before. When asked why they were such fans, her sister Nanoha said, \u201cHe\u2019s [a] good baseball player and so cute!\u201d The frenzy at home games\u00a0begins long before\u00a0the game\u00a0starts. Groups who are part of special VIP tours, along with a gaggle of Japanese and American media, gather behind ropes on the field, as they watch Ohtani emerge from the dugout to warm up. In early July, the Dodgers hosted \u201cJapanese Heritage Night,\u201d featuring performers and giveaways sponsored by\u00a0Japanese retailer\u00a0Daiso. In the distance, the ad boards along the sides of the stadium are covered with signs from Daiso and other new Japanese sponsors, like Toyo Tires and probiotic beverage company Yakult. Stan Kasten, president and CEO of the Dodgers, said the ad real estate was sold out at home, so sponsors are now buying space at other stadiums when the Dodgers play away games. \u201cWe were expecting a spike but truly nothing like this,\u201d Kasten said. \u201cThis is good for everyone. This is good for all of baseball. And I think all of baseball is really proud at what we are experiencing opening this up in a much bigger way to our international fan base.\u201d \u2018LA Rising\u2019 Kasten said there are tour buses dropping off fans from Japan at Dodger Stadium \u201cmorning and night.\u201d Many of those tour buses are also stopping in Little Tokyo, where these visitors can see the 150-foot-tall Ohtani mural that has made headlines in Japan. The artwork, entitled \u201cLA Rising,\u201d was painted freehand by artist Robert Vargas, on the side of the Miyako Hotel. Fans stop at the street corner, point their phones at a QR code on the sidewalk, then raise their phones to the mural to see an augmented reality where Ohtani swings, then pitches, before they hear the sound of announcer Vin Scully saying, \u201cIt\u2019s time for Dodger baseball!\u201d Vargas said he painted this piece in nine days at the beginning of the season, to bring everyone together at the crossroads of Los Angeles\u2019 Asian American and Latino American communities. \u201cThis area\u2019s been hard hit during Covid, and I really felt like as a long-time resident of downtown LA I wanted to be able to contribute to the AAPI community and support that,\u201d Vargas said. \u201cOhtani represents how to do things the right way on and off the field. And I wanted to celebrate that.\u201d Impressive stats Businesses like the Miyako Hotel, Mr. Ramen, and Far Bar, among others, say their foot traffic has doubled compared to this time last year. \u201cIn 2023, LA welcomed 230,000 visitors from Japan which was a 91.7% increase from 2022,\u201d said Adam Burke, president and CEO of Los Angeles Tourism. \u201cOur goal with this market would be to bring more Japanese to the city and certainly have them experience LA\u2019s sports teams, but also expand their horizons to experience other authentic and diverse LA neighborhoods and encourage longer lengths of stay.\u201d While the organization says international tourism has been improving with pandemic recovery, a 91.7% increase in visitors specifically from Japan far outpaces the overall growth in international tourists during the same year. Additionally, LA Tourism estimates that 80% to 90% of visitors from Japan go to Dodger Stadium at least once during their visit to Los Angeles. Yuhara sees that in practice, when at 3 p.m. on any home game day, Miyako Hotel\u2019s lobby is full of guests from Japan, wearing Dodgers gear, ready to head out the door. He said rooms are fully booked during home game series. In a search for downtown Los Angeles hotel rooms, CNN found higher hotel rates during Dodger home games. This difference of hotel rates per night can sometimes be upwards of $100. However, for some game days all the way into September, hotels like the Miyako are completely sold out. Across the street, Mr. Ramen, which has been serving up noodles for more than 30 years, offers a 50% discount on the first 17 bowls of ramen the day after any Ohtani home run. Far Bar offers a free shot after each Ohtani home run. The owner of Far Bar, Don Tahara, said it\u2019s a unifying moment: \u201cWhen Shohei comes to bat, that\u2019s when the conversations stop.\u201d Whether fans are from Japan, Japanese American like Tahara, or have no connection to Japan at all, the craze continues in full swing.

{"id": "travel_stranger-invite-vacation-italy-chance-encounter", "text": "Carter Leathers was sitting at a table on the terrace of a boutique hotel in the center of Florence, Italy \u2013 sipping a Negroni and trying to calm her nerves. The courtyard was peaceful, open and airy, dotted with aperitivo-hour drinkers. Carter tried to soak up the Florentine vibes \u2013 and avoid checking her phone and reading the inevitable anxious messages from her mother. Then through the stone arches into the courtyard, walked a tall, confident-looking guy in a blue suit. This must be Max Ratzenb\u00f6ck, thought Carter. The man was looking around the courtyard, and then his eyes met Carter\u2019s. He started smiling, looking instantly pleased to see her. This feeling was mutual. Carter smiled back. \u201cWow, he looks good,\u201d Carter thought to herself. Carter and Max said their hellos. And soon Max was sitting opposite Carter, his own Negroni in hand. \u201cOnce we started talking, we just kept smiling at each other,\u201d Carter tells CNN Travel today. \u201cWe just hit it off.\u201d The decision to meet up in Florence no longer felt quite so crazy. \u201cOkay, yeah. This is going to work,\u201d Carter recalls thinking. An \u2018Eat, Pray, Love\u2019 trip It was late August 2022. Carter, a 35-year-old esthetician from Sacramento, California, was on what she calls an \u201cEat, Pray, Love-style\u201d vacation in Europe. Earlier that summer, Carter had dated a guy in California and she\u2019d hoped their relationship might go somewhere. Instead, it unceremoniously ended. In the wake of that disappointment, Carter made a conscious choice to shift her priorities. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m just going to go do my own thing. I\u2019m not waiting for anybody,\u2019\u201d she thought. With that mindset, Carter booked a solo trip to Europe. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m just going to go and explore and kind of see what happens, and see who I meet,\u2019\u201d recalls Carter. Carter was excited for a change of scene, a change of pace. She loves art and imagined herself whiling away afternoons in galleries in picturesque European cities \u2013 without having to accommodate a partner\u2019s needs or requirements. While putting together her itinerary, Carter knew Florence and Rome were non-negotiable stop-offs. But she wasn\u2019t sure about her third destination. She weighed up options and in the end, she got inspiration from an unlikely place: an episode of reality television show \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d filmed in Vienna, Austria. The episode included sweeping shots of the historic buildings and green parks. \u201cThe city looked so pretty,\u201d recalls Carter. Flights booked and hotel reservations made, Carter decided to switch her dating app location settings to Vienna. Carter\u2019s app of choice was Bumble, which prompts women to make the first move in hetrosexual pairings. \u201cI was like, \u2018Okay, let\u2019s see what the guys look like in Vienna,\u2019\u201d Carter recalls. And that\u2019s when Carter saw Max Ratzenb\u00f6ck for the first time. \u201cAs I started swiping, he was the second guy that came up and I was just like, \u2018Oh, my gosh, I hope we match,\u2019\u201d Carter recalls. A couple of hours later, Carter\u2019s phone pinged: Max from Vienna had liked her back. It was a match. A dating app match In the summer of 2022 Max was a 31-year-old Austrian comedian finding his footing in his personal life and career in the wake of the pandemic. \u201cI\u2019d just moved into the apartment I\u2019d always wanted to have \u2013 it was in the middle of Vienna, it\u2019s an old apartment, a bit of a bachelor pad,\u201d Max tells CNN Travel today. \u201cI was acting and I\u2019m a comedian. But since Covid, I left the stage, basically, because at that time, the stage was not really an option.\u201d Like many comedians in the wake of the pandemic, Max turned to TikTok. He found some success posting comedic videos there, and became focused on growing his social media audience, while also juggling his day job at an advertising agency. \u201cBasically that\u2019s what all I was doing \u2013 meeting with friends and working \u2013 and then I took a chance on Bumble too,\u201d says Max. Max vividly remembers the moment he opened the dating app and saw Carter for the first time. \u201cThere\u2019s this gorgeous-looking lady on my front page,\u201d he recalls. Max was so struck by Carter, he remembers questioning if she was \u201ceven real.\u201d \u201cI would get that question a lot, if I was real,\u201d says Carter today. \u201cThey\u2019d be like, \u2018Oh this is a fake profile.\u2019\u201d Max swiped to the right \u201cimmediately.\u201d Then he got the notification: Carter liked him too, it was a match. Max couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cThat turned out to be a very good decision,\u201d says Max, of his decision to swipe right on Carter\u2019s profile. \u201cThe best I ever made.\u201d Max and Carter started messaging back and forth right away, with Carter explaining to Max she was based in the US, but would be visiting Europe in a few weeks time. Their messages were light, flirty, and friendly. Carter suggested Max could maybe show her around Vienna. \u201cI was totally, totally doing that,\u201d says Max. \u201cI blocked all my stuff out of my calendar to have four to five days to show Carter around Vienna.\u201d A spontaneous decision Carter and Max exchanged regular messages in the lead up to her arrival in Europe. Then, when Carter got to Italy, she and Max switched from chatting on Bumble to using messaging app WhatsApp. And now they were in the same time zone, their back and forth became even more frequent. \u201cWhen I was in Rome, I started texting him more and more,\u201d recalls Carter. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, he seems like a nice guy.\u2019 But you never know who you\u2019re talking to.\u201d Carter was excited, but also a little wary about the idea of meeting up with a total stranger in a foreign country. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to meet up with this guy, I should FaceTime him to make sure he\u2019s real,\u201d she thought. So one evening, while she was relaxing on the balcony of her Rome hotel room, Carter spontaneously hit the call button on her cell phone. Some 700 miles away in Vienna, Max was sitting at home, playing video games online with friends. \u201cIt was a Saturday night. It was summer, it was really hot,\u201d recalls Max. \u201cI think I\u2019d played basketball, had a nice shower, and now there was a nice summer breeze coming in. And then she called me for the first time.\u201d Max saw Carter\u2019s name pop up on his phone and immediately dropped the video game controller. \u201cI told my friends to get off \u2013 \u2018I\u2019m not here for the next two or three games,\u2019\u201d recalls Max. \u201cAnd then we had our first talk face to face. She was on her balcony having a glass of red wine in Rome.\u201d Carter thought it was \u201cendearing\u201d that, rather than being out partying on a Saturday night, Max was home playing video games. She felt it boded well for their potential connection. \u201cI\u2019m more of a homebody too,\u201d explains Carter. And even though she\u2019d called him out of the blue, Max looked thrilled to speak with her. The video chat quashed any worries Carter had about meeting Max in person. \u201cIt just felt really easy talking to him,\u201d she says. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, this is nice. I like this guy.\u2019\u201d During the FaceTime call, Carter mentioned she was going to be going to Florence next. Max then spoke a bit about his memories of Florence \u2013 it was a city he\u2019d visited multiple times, as he\u2019d spent regular family vacations in Tuscany growing up. As Max described his fondness for Florence, a thought crossed Carter\u2019s mind. \u201cI\u2019m just gonna be wandering around the city by myself,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you actually want to come meet me in Florence?\u201d Carter pretty much assumed Max would say no \u2013 she figured he\u2019d be busy, unable to make it work, unwillingly to spontaneously travel to Italy. But to her surprise, Max just smiled and said yes immediately. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait,\u201d recalls Max. \u201cI was completely stoked to meet her. We\u2019d been talking for a couple of weeks and it intensified over time. So I got that flight to Florence.\u201d An Italian rendez-vous That\u2019s how Carter came to be waiting for Max in the hotel courtyard on August 31, 2022 sipping her Negroni. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018This is either going to go really good or really bad,\u2019\u201d Carter recalls. \u201cI was trying not to be nervous.\u201d Max was nervous too. When he told a close friend about his plans, his friend was pretty blunt. \u201cOh, wow,\u201d the friend said. \u201cEither this is going to become the biggest romance of all time, or it\u2019s going to be the worst holiday of your life.\u201d \u201cYeah, you\u2019re probably right,\u201d said Max. Carter\u2019s mother, meanwhile, was \u201cso worried.\u201d In a series of frantic texts, she told Carter to hide her passport, and send updates as soon as she\u2019d met Max in person. Despite the nerves \u2013 and their loved ones\u2019 apprehension \u2013 as soon as Carter and Max met in person on the Florence hotel terrace, they both felt certain they\u2019d made the right decision. They spent the rest of the evening chatting, flirting and laughing over cocktails. This evening set the tone for the rest of the four days, in which they were together pretty much 24/7. \u201cWe just hit it off so well that I was like, \u2018Just stay with me. I want you to stay with me,\u2019\u201d recalls Carter. \u201cAnd so he ended up staying with me in my hotel the rest of the time in Florence. Pretty much from the moment we met, we were together.\u201d In Florence, Carter and Max spent the days sightseeing around the city and evenings ducking into osterias to share bottles of wine and bowls of pasta. They took photos together \u2013 including their first-ever picture, posing on Florence\u2019s Ponte Vecchio bridge \u2013 something that should have been awkward, but they both wanted to capture the moment. Carter texted the pictures to her mother and sister. \u201cWow, you look great together,\u201d they replied. Max also sent the Ponte Vecchio photo to his mother. \u201cI told her right away,\u201d recalls Max. \u201cI said: \u2018Wow, look at that picture, isn\u2019t she beautiful? We hit it off and it\u2019s going great.\u2019\u201d When their time in Florence came to an end, Carter and Max traveled on to Vienna, together. \u201cIt was three, four days in Florence,\u201d recalls Carter. \u201cAnd then another four days in Vienna,\u201d adds Max. \u201cSo our first date lasted a week,\u201d says Carter, laughing. Falling in love in Vienna After the amazing time in Florence, Max was excited to show Carter around Vienna, the city he called home. \u201cI was pretty eager to give her the cr\u00e8me-de-la-cr\u00e8me tour,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a very proud Austrian. I\u2019m very happy with this capital city. We have this very beautiful city.\u201d Unlike Florence and Rome, Vienna is \u201cnever really on the list of places for Americans who do Europe,\u201d says Max. \u201cThat\u2019s so weird to me,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause it\u2019s the center of culture. And it\u2019s gorgeous.\u201d Max was determined Carter would fall in love with Vienna \u2013 especially given they were falling for one another too. The first evening was spent at Vienna\u2019s historic opera house watching Puccini\u2019s romantic opera \u201cLa Boh\u00e8me.\u201d Max and Carter sat hand-in-hand in the theater, drank red wine in intermission and afterward Max introduced Carter to a Viennese tradition. \u201cThere\u2019s a very famous sausage stand, right next to the Opera House, where you would meet the president after the opera \u2013 because everybody goes there to get a sausage and a piece of bread with mustard, and eat it and have a last sip of beer before they go home after the opera,\u201d says Max. The two also toured the city\u2019s numerous palaces, visited the Sch\u00f6nbrunn Zoo and rode the historic Ferris wheel. For Carter and Max, the time in Vienna was both a whirlwind romantic haze and defined by a feeling of easy, surprising intimacy. \u201cI was really comfortable. When we were in Vienna, he was already ironing my clothes for me,\u201d says Carter. \u201cIt went from zero to 100, really, really quick, in terms of comfort. \u201cHe just took such good care of me and that\u2019s what really impressed me. He watched out for me, he showed me around\u2026\u201d Then, all of a sudden, the week was up and Carter had to fly back to California. Max took Carter to the airport and as they said their goodbyes in the departures area, he was firm that the farewell wasn\u2019t forever: \u201cI\u2019m going to come and see you in California,\u201d he promised. As they hugged goodbye, a feeling of certainty crossed Carter\u2019s mind. \u201cThis is it,\u201d she thought. \u201cAnd either I\u2019m going to have to move here, or he\u2019s going to have to move to America.\u201d Carter boarded her flight, and Max went home alone. Back in his apartment, Max called his mother to fill her in properly on his romantic adventure, enthusing about Carter and their time together. \u201cAnd then I put my phone away and I was sitting there, I was like \u2018Oh, this is weird,\u2019\u201d he says. Max suddenly felt lonely and sad \u2013 and simultaneously, he found himself marveling at that feeling. \u201cYou met this person only a week before \u2013 three and a half weeks before online \u2013 and now she\u2019s not here and it\u2019s horrible,\u201d he thought. Max\u2019s life in Vienna felt empty without Carter. And over the next few weeks, as he wandered around the city, Max realized every corner of the city reminded him of her \u2013 whether he was walking past the sausage stand outside the Opera House, or just spotting the Ferris wheel turning in the city skyline. Back in Sacramento, Carter kept having to remind herself that her visit to Europe wasn\u2019t a dream. It felt like a \u201cfairy tale,\u201d she says. And it was hard to wrap her head around everything that had happened in such a short space of time. As soon as he could, Max booked a flight to visit Carter for later in the fall. Eventually, this visit rolled around. \u201cI went and picked him up from the airport. And I was like, \u2018I cannot believe he\u2019s here. I can\u2019t believe it. Oh my gosh, this is real. He really came. He\u2019s really here,\u2019\u201d recalls Carter. A California visit Carter wanted to introduce Max to the best of California in the same way he\u2019d shown her Vienna. So first they stopped off in San Francisco, then the two went to Napa Valley and spent a few days in the wine country. \u201cI took him wine tasting and showed him all over there,\u201d recalls Carter. \u201cIt was really fun.\u201d Carter also introduced Max to her whole family and they all traveled together to the coastal city of Monterey for a few days\u2019 vacation. \u201cIt was great. We just threw him into the fire,\u201d says Carter. \u201cWe had a lot of fun,\u201d says Max. \u201cMonterey is a little nice town on the coast on the way south \u2013 I totally fell in love with that place too.\u201d When Max and Carter said goodbye at the end of Max\u2019s trip, they promised to meet again as soon as they could. And so Carter booked a trip to Vienna for December, which happened to coincide with her birthday. Carter assumed they\u2019d stay in Vienna, wander around the Christmas markets \u2013 but Max had a surprise up his sleeve: \u201cHe said, \u2018We\u2019re going to Paris for your birthday,\u2019\u201d recalls Carter. She couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cI had always wanted to see Paris,\u201d says Carter. After the Parisian getaway, Carter returned to the US for Christmas. Max joined her, and the two welcomed the New Year together, excited for all 2023 might bring. But while Carter and Max were certain they wanted to be together, the shape of their future was still uncertain. They\u2019d both spent way more money on international flights in 2022 than they\u2019d ever anticipated. It just wasn\u2019t sustainable to travel back and forth so regularly. So Max and Carter waited it out for a few months, and while the nine-hour time difference was difficult to navigate, the couple remained committed to one another from across the Atlantic. Making a decision After a few months apart, in spring 2023 Carter returned to Austria, joining Max on a family vacation to the south of the country. \u201cThat was the first time she met my dad and my brother and his girlfriend and my mom,\u201d says Max. The trip was a bit of a baptism of fire, Max admits. \u201cWe went on this unbelievably long biking trip,\u201d he recalls. \u201cShe did so well, I couldn\u2019t believe it, because it was, like, 55 kilometers \u2013 you know, really long \u2013 electric vehicles, up and down the hills \u2013 but with several wine breaks, so that made it a bit easier.\u201d It was during this trip that Carter and Max started talking more seriously about the future, and what it might look like. \u201cI want you here with me,\u201d Max told Carter. \u201cI want you here with me more than anything.\u201d But when the topic of marriage came up, Carter was surprised to realize they were on slightly different pages. All her friends in the US in committed relationships were married. But Max had friends in Austria who\u2019d been with their partners for over a decade and shared several kids, but had no intention of ever signing marriage papers. To Carter, this seemed to be something of a cultural gap \u2013 maybe there was a stronger commitment to the institution of marriage in the US than in Austria? Max even said he never planned to get married. But when Carter explained that marriage was important to her, a crucial symbol of commitment in a relationship, Max understood. He wanted to be with Carter forever, that much was sure. And so Max and Carter confirmed marriage was in their future. Also in their future? Carter leaving California and permanently moving to Vienna. This was a big decision, but Carter had fallen in love with the Austrian capital, and was excited at the idea of a life there. The couple did also consider Max moving to the US, but in the end, Vienna won out. \u201cIt\u2019s always ranked the most livable city in the world,\u201d Carter says, referring to the recent Economist Intelligence Unit list of the world\u2019s most livable cities, which ranked Vienna at number one for the third year in a row.\u00a0\u201cWe just felt quality of life would be a lot better here in Vienna.\u201d As for Max, he suggests moving to the US at some point isn\u2019t off the table. \u201cI\u2019ve always had a very big affiliation with America,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd why should I not take the same thing on my back that Carter did for me, and move over to America? We\u2019ll see. But I think that Vienna is just the perfect place to live, all in all.\u201d In May 2023, Carter moved out of her Sacramento apartment, sold her car and all her furniture, packed a couple of suitcases, and moved across the world to start a new life. Sadly, just as Carter set off for the airport, Max\u2019s grandmother unexpectedly passed away. Carter arrived in Vienna to a grieving Max and a few days later, accompanied him to the funeral. It was a \u201crough start,\u201d admits Max. But he was so pleased to see Carter. For both Max and Carter, being by each other\u2019s side during this tough period reinforced their certainty that they\u2019d made the right decision. \u201cYou want to have your better half at your side when life gets a bit hard,\u201d says Max. \u201cAnd my grandma was really important to me, so I appreciated Carter being there.\u201d Carter didn\u2019t bring much with her to Europe \u2013 she\u2019d sold basically everything, after all. But there was one non-negotiable: her dog, Waffles. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to come without her,\u201d says Carter. Max was almost as excited about Waffles moving in as he was finally living with Carter. \u201cI never had a dog, ever,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I always wanted one. She\u2019s awesome.\u201d Adjusting to life in Vienna was a big change \u2013 for both Waffles and Carter \u2013 but Carter felt supported by Max as she began to accilimatize to Austria. \u201cHe made it very easy for me to come over and start my life here,\u201d she says. A wedding and an anniversary In late August 2023, on the one year anniversary of their first meeting, Carter and Max got married in Austria, in a small city hall wedding attended by immediate family. Carter took Max\u2019s name, becoming Carter Ratzenb\u00f6ck. \u201cWe had a little brunch with our eight guests,\u201d says Max. \u201cAnd then we took off to go right back to Florence.\u201d In Florence, Max and Carter retraced the steps of their first trip together. The couple recreated their first ever photo together \u2013 taken a year previously, on Florence\u2019s Ponte Vecchio Bridge. And as a nod to that first date, Carter dug out the sparkly headband she\u2019d worn that day, which serendipitously coordinated with her white wedding dress. The couple also took photos in the Uffizi Gallery, kissing in front of Botticelli\u2019s \u201cThe Birth of Venus.\u201d And as they walked around Florence, passersby, spotting that they were newlyweds, started cheering and clapping. Today Max and Carter are fast approaching their first wedding anniversary \u2013 and the two year anniversary of their first meeting. They plan to return to Florence once again to celebrate both occasions. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of making it a thing,\u201d says Carter. \u201cThis will be year three in Florence.\u201d For Carter and Max it\u2019s surreal to think how much their lives have changed since their first meeting just two years ago. Today, Carter admits it was \u201ckind of crazy\u201d to arrange a date with a guy who lived on the other side of the world. And Max appreciates it was \u201cpretty crazy\u201d to fly to Florence to see a woman he met on the internet. The couple are grateful everything worked out \u2013 and appreciate their happy ending was perhaps against the odds. But Carter\u2019s also grateful for their mutual optimistic outlook, which defined their early decisions and still defines their relationship today. \u201cBe optimistic,\u201d she says. \u201cTake a chance \u2013 that\u2019s what I was thinking at the time.\u201d After all, Carter says, if she hadn\u2019t been optimistic about travel, about love, about Max \u2013 her life today would look very different. Carter and Max suggest their story also disproves the notion that falling in love via a dating app is less romantic than stumbling across a stranger the old-fashioned way. \u201cThank goodness for dating apps,\u201d says Carter. \u201cIt allowed us to reach each other. Because I would never have met him otherwise. There\u2019s no way we would have ever ran into each other. Because like we said, he likes to stay in and play video games\u2026 And how cool is it that you get to meet somebody through this app, on the other side of the world and see what those people are like? I just think online dating opens up so many more possibilities.\u201d \u201cI think our story is the perfect example that the impossible is out there,\u201d adds Max. \u201cAll those parts\u2026 with meeting online, one in the heart of Europe, one on the west coast in America, one completely involved in his life and one in her life traveling\u2026 All those puzzle pieces are perfect for a novel, but not for real life, at least that\u2019s what most people think. But that\u2019s not true. We are the best example. And we\u2019re very happy that it happened that way.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/stranger-invite-vacation-italy-chance-encounter/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_vacation-fling-love-story-chance-encounters", "text": "Guillermo Barrantes relationship with Larry Mock was supposed to begin and end in Palm Springs. It was a \u201ccasual, brief encounter.\u201d A vacation dalliance that only lasted half a day. \u201cIt was just so casual, so easily nothing could have happened from it,\u201d Guillermo tells CNN Travel. \u201cWe could have walked away and just had our lives separate. But of course that didn\u2019t happen, because it wasn\u2019t meant to be that way. It was meant to be the way that it was. That it is.\u201d It all started in summer 2013. Guillermo - then in his early 40s - was on vacation in the California resort city of Palm Springs. He was in a phase of life where, he says, he was prioritizing himself, and wasn\u2019t interested in long term romance. \u201cI thrived in being by myself, in traveling by myself, in having dinner by myself \u2013 I loved all of that so much,\u201d says Guillermo, who lived in Boston, Massachusetts at the time. \u201cI wanted no commitment, I wanted no emotional entanglement of any kind. I wanted to have fun, get to know myself. And it was in that mode that I met Larry, when I wasn\u2019t really looking.\u201d During the vacation in Palm Springs, Guillermo was staying at a friend\u2019s apartment, and while the friend worked during the day, Guillermo passed his time at a \u201crun-down, no-frills\u201d resort a couple of blocks away. \u201cYou could just pay for a day pass, they\u2019d give you a towel, and you could be in the pool and use their bar,\u201d he recalls. One day, as he was walking the palm tree-lined streets to the resort, Guillermo swiped right on a guy on a dating app \u2013 Larry Mock, mid-40s, friendly smile. The two men exchanged a few messages back and forth. Larry said he was also on vacation in Palm Springs, staying in the resort Guillermo kept frequenting. They arranged to meet there for a drink by the pool. Guillermo was looking forward to meeting Larry, expecting \u201csome casual fun.\u201d Then, when Guillermo and Larry met, there was \u201cchemistry\u201d right away. Guillermo calls their connection \u201cmagnetic.\u201d \u201cMy impression of Larry: sexy, handsome and warm,\u201d he recalls. Larry was a Texas-based American Airlines flight attendant who\u2019d booked the vacation to Palm Springs at the last minute. He\u2019d recently broken up with a long-term partner but due to lease and budget reasons the two were still living together \u2013 awkwardly \u2013 in Dallas, Texas. Larry\u2019s workdays were spent traveling the world. But during his downtime, he struggled to relax in the apartment with his ex, and this sentiment motivated the spontaneous vacation. \u201cI needed to get out of town for the weekend, because we were just butting heads badly at that time,\u201d Larry tells CNN Travel today. Larry searched his airline\u2019s database, looking at destinations he could visit using the last minute, standby flight tickets available for flight attendants. \u201cPalm Springs had seats, so I booked my standby flight, got to Palm Springs, checked into this resort. And that\u2019s where Guillermo came into the picture,\u201d says Larry. Larry was instantly attracted to Guillermo. He thought he was \u201cjust the most handsome guy\u201d he\u2019d ever seen. And as they got chatting, and Guillermo kept making Larry laugh, Larry sketched out his first impression to include two more adjectives: \u201cso funny, and so kind.\u201d In passing, as the two flirted over pool-side cocktails, Larry mentioned that he was a flight attendant. Guillermo lit up. In fact, his response was \u201cgiddy,\u201d as Larry recalls it. \u201cHe started asking me tons of questions about planes, and flight attendants, and the routes and all of that kind of stuff.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a huge aviation geek,\u201d explains Guillermo. As a kid growing up in Costa Rica, he\u2019d wanted to be a pilot. Instead, he ended up working as an IT consultant. And while he says he was good at that job, liked it well enough and made good money \u2013 he still dreamed about working in aviation. Meeting a flight attendant was fascinating. \u201cI was immediately drawn to his career,\u201d says Guillermo. Larry found Guillermo\u2019s enthusiasm for aviation charming, and happily answered his questions. Later that evening, Larry and Guillermo said their goodbyes, with no plans to meet again. \u201cI was glad to meet him,\u201d says Larry. \u201cBut I was like, \u2018There\u2019s no way I am going to pursue dating somebody that lived in Boston.\u2019 And I still was dealing with what I was dealing with in Dallas.\u201d \u201cWe just really enjoyed the time that we had together,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cBut we went our separate ways.\u201d Unexpected moments Almost without realizing \u2013 and certainly without intending to \u2013 Guillermo and Larry stayed in touch. \u201cWe kept chatting, we kept texting,\u201d says Guillermo. Then, a few days after meeting Larry, Guillermo got an unexpected phone call from his mother in Costa Rica. He was still in Palm Springs at the time. \u201cShe said, \u2018I don\u2019t want you to freak out, but I just got diagnosed with breast cancer. I don\u2019t want you to change the trip.\u2019\u201d Guillermo tried to protest, but his mother insisted he should enjoy the rest of his vacation. She reassured him that her sisters and Guillermo\u2019s father were taking care of her, and she\u2019d see Guillermo later in the month \u2013 he already had a trip to Costa Rica scheduled for that summer. Not wanting to go against his mother\u2019s wishes, Guillermo stayed put in the desert. He tried to \u201ccompartmentalize\u201d the news, but he was really close to his mom, and it was cataclysmic. Later, back home in Boston, Guillermo found himself sharing his mother\u2019s news with Larry, and confiding in him about his fears and worries. He added that his mother lived in Costa Rica, so he\u2019d likely be flying back and forth for the rest of the year. Larry was supportive, empathetic \u2013 and he told Guillermo that he should use the discounted flights Larry got through work. Guillermo was taken aback \u2013 it was \u201csuch a sweet gesture\u201d from someone who was basically a stranger. But then, somehow, Larry already felt much more than that. \u201cVery early on, he and I had just beautiful interactions, and it revealed the kind of person that he was,\u201d he says. And so, rather than dwindling, Larry and Guillermo\u2019s communication increased as the days rolled on. \u201cWithin just a few weeks, we just knew \u2013 without much discussion, without talking about it \u2013 we just knew that there was a very, very strong connection there,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cWe always had something to talk about,\u201d says Larry. Larry was still hesitant about jumping into something new, following the breakdown of his previous relationship. But the messages back and forth with Guillermo became a highlight of his day. And as time passed, he found himself opening up to Guillermo, confiding in him. \u201cAfter a few months, I was like, \u2018Yes, this is exactly what I was looking for my whole life. Someone that I can be my authentic self with,\u2019\u201d says Larry. Long-distance dating In September 2013, two months after their Palm Springs meeting, Larry arranged to visit Guillermo in Boston. At Logan Airport, Larry came down the escalator and spotted Guillermo\u2019s face in the crowd. He was beaming, and started running towards Larry. Then, Guillermo \u201chugged me so hard,\u201d recalls Larry. He remembers thinking, \u201cOh my god, this is the one.\u201d Then Guillermo and Larry went to Boston\u2019s seaport district together, and found a sundrenched rooftop bar where they sat drinking beers. \u201cWe could see the planes approaching Logan, and it was just a sunny and perfect Boston day,\u201d recalls Guillermo. \u201cI remember that, like a picture, sitting by the edge \u2013 I remember the beer and I remember the planes.\u201d It was \u201cmagical,\u201d says Guillermo, but also slightly \u201csurreal.\u201d The Palm Springs encounter was so brief. He never thought he\u2019d see Larry again. And now here Larry was, sitting opposite him, in Guillermo\u2019s city. From there, Guillermo and Larry started dating cross-country. They took advantage of Larry\u2019s discounted flights. Sometimes Larry traveled to Boston, but usually Guillermo visited Larry in Dallas. Guillermo\u2019s love of flying meant that, for him, the four-hour journey across the country was part of the fun. \u201cI was in heaven,\u201d he says. \u201cJust the fact that I was getting to do something that I have always just loved - which is being on an airplane and going somewhere.\u201d Each Friday, as he packed his bag and headed to the airport, Guillermo would also be struck with \u201cexcitement\u201d at the thought of seeing Larry. And during these weekend visits, Guillermo and Larry grew accustomed to each other\u2019s habits, how they moved through their days, how they liked to spend their time. Guillermo got to know Larry\u2019s friends and got to know Dallas as a city. They spoke about their hopes, dreams, ambitions and families. Guillermo says it was obvious that they were \u201cvery aligned on the important aspects of life: how we view finances, closeness with families, politically and world views and enjoyment of the small things in life.\u201d Larry supported Guillermo as he cared for his mother through her cancer, and celebrated with him when she recovered. \u201cFor us, it was a gradual process of falling in love,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cBut a theme for us in our life together is that everything felt right and natural.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t pinpoint the moment, but we simply knew very deep in our hearts that we found the life partner.\u201d \u201cThat made me so happy,\u201d says Larry. For Guillermo, moving to Dallas two years later, in late 2015, was \u201cjust as the easiest decision.\u201d Larry was thrilled. His Dallas-based friendship group had already welcomed Guillermo into the fold, and his parents were happy for him too. \u201cI introduced Guillermo to everybody,\u201d says Larry. \u201cMy family\u2019s always been very accepting of me.\u201d Guillermo\u2019s family situation was more complicated. He\u2019s always been very close with his parents and siblings, but for the first two decades of his adult life, he didn\u2019t talk to his family about relationships. \u201cMy personal life was not necessarily an open book,\u201d Guillermo says. \u201cLove has never been the question - my parents love me, I love my parents and my sisters, we all get along great. But there was always that invisible barrier, which was: I don\u2019t talk about my personal relationships.\u201d But Guillermo didn\u2019t want to hide Larry from anyone - he felt he owed that to himself, and to Larry. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to edit myself, I wasn\u2019t going to filter. I just knew deep in my heart that it was my chance to be able to truly be myself,\u201d he says. So Guillermo started peppering his phone calls home with mentions of Larry. He uploaded cute photos of the two of them to social media. \u201cI\u2019m fearless,\u201d he told himself. \u201cNothing bad can happen here.\u201d A monumental year Cut to 2018, which was a monumental year for Guillermo and Larry for a couple of reasons. For one, it was the year Guillermo followed in Larry\u2019s footsteps and became a flight attendant. It was a mutual friend who suggested Guillermo should give it a shot, and Larry \u2013 who\u2019d spent years listening to Guillermo wax lyrical about airplanes \u2013 was wholeheartedly encouraging. Guillermo applied to Larry\u2019s airline, American Airlines, but wasn\u2019t accepted. But then he applied to Delta, and was accepted on the spot. While Guillermo and Larry loved the idea of working together, flying with different airlines also \u201cworked out great,\u201d says Guillermo. For one, there were two different sets of airline benefits to enjoy. And working in the air was everything Guillermo hoped it would be and more. \u201cI was doing my dream job, my childhood dream job,\u201d he says. \u201cI still have to pinch myself that actually, I am a flight attendant.\u201d 2018 was also the year Guillermo and Larry got married. Guillermo proposed to Larry on an airplane. The couple were flying back to Dallas after visiting San Francisco, where they\u2019d attended an Adele concert. As they were descending, the Dallas lights glistening out the airplane window, Guillermo suddenly felt the time was right. He turned to Larry and asked him to marry him. Larry smiled, and said yes. \u201cDespite it being impromptu, as an aviation geek, I love that I proposed on a flight,\u201d says Guillermo. The couple started planning their nuptials. Guillermo was excited, but he was unsure what role \u2013 if any \u2013 his family would play on the wedding day. While Guillermo had mentioned Larry to his parents, they still hadn\u2019t met him. This was partly because Guillermo\u2019s family were in Costa Rica, and partly because Guillermo wasn\u2019t sure how that meeting would play out. \u201cThe person that I had the most trouble with was my father \u2013 because he was the one that had the hardest time really accepting me,\u201d says Guillermo. As plans for the wedding started to take shape, Guillermo composed a long email to his father. \u201cI said something to the effect of, \u2018Hey Dad, I know I really haven\u2019t really talked much about any of my personal life. But I met this person, Larry, who is the love of my life. We are going to get married. Come, don\u2019t come, no problem. But I just need to tell you because this is probably one of the most important days and times of my life.\u2019\u201d Guillermo\u2019s father didn\u2019t attend the wedding. \u201cFor those reasons and also because he was towards the end of his life, his mobility was a problem,\u201d Guillermo says. \u201cBut my mom, my sisters, my niece and my nephew came, which was far more than I ever imagined or dreamed. That was such a great moment.\u201d Guillermo introduced his mother and sisters to Larry a couple of days before the wedding. They all gathered at a rooftop bar in Dallas, along with Guillermo and Larry\u2019s close friends. When Guillermo\u2019s mother saw Larry for the first time, she enveloped Larry in her arms. The two hit it off right away. Guillermo was overwhelmed with happiness. \u201cFor me, to see Larry and mom interact \u2013 they just love each other so much,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cAnd my sisters just cannot get enough of him \u2013 I just sit back, and just enjoy.\u201d A magical wedding day Guillermo and Larry\u2019s wedding took place at the Dallas Arboretum, a botanical garden. It was an outdoor wedding, and the couple woke up to the rain pouring and concerned texts from guests worried how the wedding would play out in a downpour. \u201cBut then, sure enough, out came the sun at the right time,\u201d recalls Guillermo. Larry and Guillermo wrote their own vows and read them to each other during the ceremony. Guillermo told Larry that he inspired him to be a better son, sibling, friend and person. \u201cYou want a partner that is going to challenge you to be better,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cI always feel that I want to be a better human being just in general, because he is such a figure in my life and everyone\u2019s life \u2013 he is the center of everybody\u2019s life.\u201d In turn, Larry promised Guillermo their married life would be \u201cexciting, adventurous and full of passion.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m proud to take you as my husband. I promise to fly with you to the ends of the earth,\u201d Larry said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to grow old together and look back at this beautiful moment.\u201d He ended the vows telling Guillermo: \u201cTe amo\u201d \u2013 Spanish for \u201cI love you.\u201d The reception was held at a local winery. During the celebrations, Guillermo and Larry danced to Rihanna\u2019s hit \u201cWe Found Love,\u201d which includes the lyric: \u201cWe found love in a hopeless place.\u201d The couple felt it was fitting \u2013 the resort they met at did seem a bit of a \u201chopeless place.\u201d And they never expected that brief meeting would lead to a lasting love. \u201cWe made sure that song was played, because we did find love in a hopeless place,\u201d says Larry. \u201cAnd I love Rihanna, too,\u201d says Guillermo. At one point, Guillermo and Larry walked through the reception doors holding hands, spontaneously lifting their arms in the air, a \u201cvictorious\u201d pose, as Guillermo put it. \u201cIt was just an electric effect,\u201d he says. The last piece of the puzzle A few years into their marriage, Guillermo and Larry visited Costa Rica together for the first time. Larry was excited to see Guillermo\u2019s home country, and Guillermo was excited to show his husband where he grew up \u2013 and the visit was also an opportunity for Larry to finally meet Guillermo\u2019s father. Guillermo was nervous about how the meeting would play out, but when he arrived at his parents\u2019 house with Larry in tow, Guillermo\u2019s father opened his arms and hugged Larry tightly. \u201cHe said, \u2018Welcome home,\u2019\u201d says Guillermo. It was a cathartic, emotional moment for everyone. \u201cI was so nervous that day, meeting the father-in-law,\u201d says Larry. \u201cAnd when he just said \u2018welcome home,\u2019 and hugged me, every bit of nerves went away. I felt comfortable, I felt welcomed, I felt loved.\u201d Larry says the moment felt like the \u201clast piece\u201d of a puzzle slotting into place. Guillermo was overjoyed. \u201cThat evening, which we got to spend \u2013 me, mom, dad, and Larry \u2013 was just a highlight,\u201d says Guillermo. The family played old records on a turntable. Guillermo and his mother danced in the living room, while Larry and Guillermo\u2019s father sipped cocktails and watched, laughing. \u201cI had to just step back, because you have to look at those moments and just kind of create a little mini movie of them,\u201d says Guillermo. Guillermo\u2019s father has since passed away, which makes Guillermo and Larry all the more grateful for that time together in Costa Rica. In general, a feeling of gratitude defines Guillermo and Larry\u2019s relationship \u2013 gratitude for each other and what they\u2019ve brought to one another\u2019s lives, and gratitude that their paths crossed over ten years ago. On their anniversary, the couple usually return to Palm Springs to celebrate the day they met. \u201cNot only is Palm Springs beautiful with a great vibe, but we love to go back and celebrate our meeting place,\u201d says Larry. \u201cWe weren\u2019t looking, neither one of us \u2013 but it did happen, and it\u2019s definitely for life.\u201d \u201cWhat a gift,\u201d says Guillermo, who says his life today is what he dreamed of \u201cas a little gay boy in Costa Rica, always loving the US, always loving airplanes, always envisioning that I would have a relationship where we are completely free to show our love.\u201d \u201cAnd we do, we do,\u201d he says. \u201cWho could ask for anything more?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/vacation-fling-love-story-chance-encounters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "travel"}}

{"id": "2024_06_27_travel_restaurants-bars-age-restrictions-bliss-cec", "text": "When Johnny B. Barounis opened The Auction House in New York\u2019s Upper East Side in 1993, he knew he wanted to deter a certain type of customer in their early 20s \u2014 in his words, \u201cthose kids that had their flannel shirts tied around their waists, wearing their Villanova hats backwards, walking around in the street with their Amstel Light in their hand.\u201d He deliberately cultivated an atmosphere at his bar that he felt might intimidate a fresh-out-of-college 20-something: rich velvet drapes, crystal chandeliers, antique furniture. On Fridays and Saturdays, the message was more explicit: Only patrons 25 and up were allowed in the door. \u201cI didn\u2019t need a 21-year-old to come in with two of his friends, to make a ruckus and then get sick in the bathroom,\u201d Barounis says. Barounis says his age policy was rare back then, and some at the time questioned his decision to keep out younger customers. Three decades later, the bar is something of an institution \u2014 and the 25-and-up policy on weekends was so well-received that he implemented it at his sister bar, The Back Room. Today, plenty of bars and lounges around the US impose similar \u2014 if not stricter \u2014 age restrictions, hoping to curb unruly behavior sometimes exhibited by newly legal drinkers and appeal to an older crowd. But such age limits are still unusual at restaurants, as evidenced by the recent controversy around a Missouri eatery. Bliss, an upscale Caribbean restaurant that opened last month in the suburbs of St. Louis, provoked numerous headlines and fervent debate for limiting entry to women 30 and up and men 35 and up. As Barounis sees it, the uproar over the restaurant\u2019s age policy suggests it might have been too extreme. \u201cThe difference between 21 and 25 is greater than 25 and 35,\u201d he says. \u201cWhere do you draw the line?\u201d How the owner of Bliss chooses to run his business is, of course, his prerogative, Barounis and others in the hospitality industry say. But the conversation around the restaurant\u2019s unconventional age policy raises some interesting questions: To what extent can businesses dictate who their customers are? And to what extent should they? Plenty of customers appreciate age restrictions Generally, society seems to have reached a tacit (if begrudging) acceptance of age restrictions at certain establishments. Bars like Barounis\u2019 Auction House have long operated without issue, catering to customers seeking a night out without potential disruptions from patrons who haven\u2019t yet learned how to handle their liquor. Some restaurants have seen increased reservations and sales after instituting bans on young children. And adults-only hotels and resorts are popular for a reason. In fact, Bliss owner Marvin Pate tells CNN his positive dining experiences at adults-only resorts are what inspired his restaurant\u2019s age policy. He and his wife Tina Pate, both 42, found that there was a demand among people their age for an elevated spot where they could kick back, relax and hear the music they grew up listening to. \u201cWhy not just make a lounge type of feel at a resort but in a restaurant setting?\u201d Pate says of his thinking behind Bliss. \u201cMajority of (places) around the country, if you go to a place that\u2019s 35 and up, it\u2019s actually a lounge with fried food. We thought about the concept of a restaurant that\u2019s daily, where people could \u2026 get a luxe environment and just enjoy themselves with actual cooked food.\u201d Judging by the comments on the Bliss Facebook page, many customers welcome the laid-back, mature environment that Bliss promises. Several people urged the restaurant not to backtrack on its age policy despite the criticism it has received, while a few joked that they wouldn\u2019t take issue with an even higher age limit. Still, some in the comments objected to the idea that age was a reliable proxy for maturity level. Others questioned whether Bliss\u2019 stringent policy of carding people at the door was necessary to achieve the sophisticated ambiance that Pate envisioned. Would 20-somethings even want to hang out in a place where a majority of the clientele is in its 30s and 40s? \u201cAn age restriction for a restaurant is a bit of a reach unless it\u2019s a bar and event space too IMO,\u201d one commenter said. \u201cIf they want to deter disruptive crowds it\u2019s better to raise the price range not the age range.\u201d However objectionable some patrons find these age restrictions, such policies don\u2019t generally constitute age discrimination, says Trey Lindley, a civil litigator in North Carolina with the business law firm Lord & Lindley. Businesses generally have the right to set their own guidelines for service, as long as it isn\u2019t on the basis of federally protected categories such as race, religion, national origin or disability, according to Lindley. Think of the \u201cno shirts, no shoes, no service\u201d signs that proliferated in the early 1970s or Covid-era mask mandates. Though federal law prohibits age discrimination within the context of employment, Lindley notes that age isn\u2019t typically a protected characteristic when it comes to federal and state laws banning discrimination in public places. Provided that an establishment has a logical reason for its rules and enforces them uniformly, he says it generally has the right to do so. \u201cI think the biggest concern for restaurants who want to do this is potential blowback,\u201d he adds. Different age policies for men and women raise questions When bars or restaurants institute age requirements, it inevitably elicits some grumbling from those who feel excluded. Just last month, Donerick\u2019s Pub in the suburbs of Columbus, Ohio, made headlines for raising its age limit to 30 and older on Fridays and Saturdays. And each time a restaurant announces a policy restricting children, it inspires intense debate across social media. While there seemed to be a few people who were upset that Bliss implemented age restrictions at all, some of the criticism focused on the fact that the rules are different for men and women. Bliss defended its policy of allowing women 30-plus and men 35-plus, writing in a May Facebook post that it intends to create a \u201cgrown and sexy atmosphere\u201d and helps to \u201cmaintain a sophisticated environment, uphold our standards, and support the sustainability of our unique ambiance.\u201d Pate says the restaurant initially planned to institute a 35-and-up policy for both men and women, but lowered the threshold for women to cater to what he called \u201cladies night out\u201d \u2014 referring to young professional women gathering with female friends for happy hours and other social events. The five-year gap struck some customers as arbitrary, with some women who met the age requirements expressing frustration that they couldn\u2019t visit Bliss with their male partners. \u201cWhy can I come at age 30, but my husband who will be 33 this year can\u2019t?\u201d one user commented on a Facebook post from Bliss. \u201cAssuming that all young people are going to cause problems is cutting out a huge crowd of people who would bring in more business.\u201d \u201cMay I ask why the men have to be older than the women? I would love to be able to come with my fianc\u00e9 (who\u2019s older than me), but he\u2019s not 35 for 2 more years,\u201d another person wrote. Bliss\u2019 age discrepancy may be especially stark, but separate policies for men and women aren\u2019t unheard of among bars and nightclubs. Barounis, for example, recalled working at a bar in Long Island decades ago that barred women under 23 and men under 25. And for years, bars and nightclubs enticed both male and female customers by offering discounted or free drinks for women. Even if Bliss\u2019 rules likely don\u2019t constitute age discrimination, Lindley says the gender discrepancy could open the restaurant to litigation. But Pate maintains that the policies at Bliss aren\u2019t intended to discriminate against anyone. He says the goal is simply to provide a relaxing atmosphere for older customers and adds that he didn\u2019t think the restrictions were out of the norm. Experts say age-exclusive establishments are unlikely to become a trend Though restaurant and bar owners can generally set their own rules on who they allow in, hospitality industry experts that spoke to CNN are doubtful that age-exclusive establishments will become a trend. Excluding patrons under 35 or 30 omits an otherwise desirable slice of the market, says Jason Kaplan, CEO of the restaurant consulting firm JK Consulting. While bars may be able to get away with higher age restrictions, he says he wouldn\u2019t recommend such a strict policy for restaurants given that profit margins on food are much lower. Younger generations tend to spend more money on drinking and eating out, and Kaplan says it\u2019s unlikely that most businesses would want to give that up. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about that sweet spot between young professionals that you\u2019re basically going to eliminate, who are willing to pay for experiences,\u201d Kaplan says. Eddie Fahmy, CEO of A2Z Restaurant Consulting, agrees. He understands why a bar might impose age limits only on certain days, but to him, shutting out a younger demographic entirely is a risky business decision. \u201cIf you\u2019re a restaurant and you want to make money selling food and serving customers, it just doesn\u2019t make sense to me,\u201d he adds. But other establishments with strict age policies say the business model works for them. Toya Taylor, owner of the San Antonio-based 30-plus lounge Horizons & More, says she knows she\u2019s probably losing some business by barring people under 30, but she also feels that doing so reduces her liability. \u201cThe places that are starting (to use age restrictions) are going to see good results, especially if they stick to it,\u201d she adds. Meanwhile, Barounis notes that the buzz generated over Bliss\u2019 age requirements could work in its favor, and he\u2019s eager to see whether the restaurant finds success with its unusual policy or whether it ultimately reverses course. Pate, Bliss\u2019 owner, says he\u2019s not going anywhere. And when those younger customers finally turn 30 or 35, Bliss will be there, waiting to welcome them in. \u201cI feel like we have (filled) a big void that was needed inside American society and just the culture in general,\u201d he adds. \u201cPeople were asking for this, and we just gave the people what they want.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/travel/restaurants-bars-age-restrictions-bliss-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_article_how-to-survive-rattlesnake-bite", "text": "Talk about a heavenly day: The Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, temperatures in the low 70s and low humidity. Scott Vuncannon, a 58-year-old real estate developer and farmer, called his wife and said he was going hiking and would be back around 4 p.m.  He packed his safety gear, including a pistol, bear spay and enough food and water to last a couple of days, just in case. He grew up traversing the Uwharrie Mountains in central North Carolina. Now he was taking on more formidable wilderness from his summer home in Highlands, a popular resort town. Still, he had decades of hiking experience. With a 2-year-old Australian shepherd-blue heeler mix named Boone at his side, he headed to the Ellicott Rock Trail around 11 a.m. Wednesday in late August 2018. Two hours later, he was five miles in. \u201cMy dog took off chasing a squirrel, and I stopped and took a sip of water,\u201d Vuncannon recalled to CNN Travel. \u201cI called my dog \u2026 and he came headed back over. And as soon as I took a step, I saw movement.\u201d With no warning, \u201cI saw a snake head come up and strike me in my left calf. \u2026 My natural reaction was to jump back, and I bent over and pulled up my pant leg to see if he actually penetrated my long pants.\u201d Vuncannon saw two bite marks about 2 inches apart. Boone went after the snake, and only then did Vuncannon hear rattling. He tied on a tourniquet below the knee and above the bite. \u201cAs soon as I stood up, I could actually taste the poison in the back of my throat.\u201d His vision got blurry, and he sweated a lot. \u201cI pulled my phone my out and called 911, and of course, it said no cell service.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s when my heart sank.\u201d With no phone service, no human companions and the venom spreading rapidly, how would he survive? How dangerous are rattlesnakes to us?   Vuncannon was in known rattlesnake country. Their range is extensive in the Americas \u2013 from southern Canada to central Argentina. The thickest concentration is in the US Southwest and northern Mexico, according to the National Wildlife Federation. The estimated 36 rattlesnake species are adaptable, living in forests, grasslands, swamps and deserts. They may take up residence where people live and work. But for their range, US deaths from rattlesnake bites and other venomous snakes are quite rare.  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates about 7,000 to 8,000 people are bitten by venomous snakes in the United States each year. About five of those people die.  \u201cThe number of deaths would be much higher if people did not seek medical care,\u201d the CDC says. World estimates for death by venomous snakebite are much higher \u2013 81,000 to 138,000 a year. The pit viper family   Rattlesnakes are \u201cpit vipers\u201d with heat-detecting pits on their heads.  Other US snakes in that family are copperheads and cottonmouths, also called water moccasins. These latter  two species are concentrated in the central and eastern United States, whereas multiple species of rattlesnakes range across the United States.  Most pit vipers typically deliver a \u201chemotoxic\u201d venom that attacks the circulation system, destroying blood vessels and causing tissue damage. The only other venomous snakes in the United States are coral snakes. Known for their bright bands of red, yellow and black, they are in a different snake family that\u2019s related to cobras. They deliver a neurotoxin that disrupts nerve transmission and can cause respiratory failure and paralysis.    You\u2019re scared? So is the rattlesnake  Rattlesnakes\u2019 reclusive nature is one reason why there aren\u2019t more incidents. The rattlesnake \u201cactually views us as a predator; we\u2019re a large animal that could eat him. And they\u2019re afraid of us,\u201d said Ted Clamp, who founded the Edisto Island Serpentarium in coastal South Carolina in 1999 with his late brother.  Rattlesnakes tend to stay hidden.  \u201cWhen we encounter a snake on the move, he\u2019s usually looking for food or looking for a mate or looking for shelter. Otherwise, he stays hidden because they\u2019re so vulnerable to all sorts of predators.\u201d  Kimberly Andrews, who has a doctorate in ecology from University of Georgia\u2019s Marine Extension and Georgia Sea Grant and manages its Coastal Ecology Lab, said rattlesnakes are \u201csit-and-wait predators.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve seen rattlesnakes sit in one place for over a week waiting on a meal.\u201d So when there\u2019s an encounter, people have generally encroached on their territory. Where rattlesnakes hide  Rattlesnakes \u201chunt shelter constantly. They hide under these logs. They hide in stump holes \u2013 under anything they can,\u201d Clamp said. They also like woodpiles, thick brush and spaces under boulders, experts say. Clamp cited a case of a 12-year-old South Carolina boy playing at a log pile who got bit by a canebreak (timber) rattlesnake. He lived but only after a six-week hospital stay. Rodents are much more likely to get into your house than snakes, Andrews said. If snakes do get into your house, it\u2019s most likely you have a rodent infestation. Andrews said rattlesnakes play a key role in balancing the environment. \u201cThey\u2019re mostly eating mice and rats. \u2026 They\u2019re out there doing free pest control,\u201d she said. How to avoid a bite  Clamp and Andrews shared advice on how not to be a statistic. \u201cAlways be careful where you put your hands and your feet,\u201d Clamp said. \u201cIf you have a woodpile, go out and get your wood for the night during the day when you can see,\u201d Andrews added. Wear thick gloves. \u201cIf you\u2019re reaching under your house, shine a light under there. Make sure the coast is clear,\u201d she said. Other tips: \u2022 Wear closed-toe shoes and long pants when venturing into rattlesnake-friendly terrain. \u2022 Go around a rattlesnake on a wilderness trail if possible.  \u2022 If you find a rattlesnake in your yard, call agencies such as your state\u2019s natural resources departments or US Fish & Wildlife or contact a biologist at a local college, Andrews said. Do not try to kill the rattlesnake because that\u2019s when most people get bit, she said. \u2022 If you must deal with a rattlesnake on your own, Andrews says you can use a long branch or pole to gently nudge the snake toward an escape route if you\u2019re at least six feet or more away.   Andrews said rattlesnakes are most active in spring and fall, but vigilance is important all year. They might venture out in winter on a warm day. What do you do if you hear that bone-chilling rattle? \u201cUsually if he\u2019s rattling, he\u2019s alarmed,\u201d Clamp said. \u201cIf you can tell where he is and see him, back away from him. Don\u2019t approach him.\u201d Just know rattling does not come before every bite, as in Vuncannon\u2019s case. In dire straits Vuncannon knew he had to get out. \u201cI slowly, methodically started walking up the mountain, a pretty steep climb.\u201d He had only gone about a quarter of a mile when he lost his balance. He started crawling. Vuncannon was throwing up about every 15 minutes. Then he started to go in and out of consciousness.  \u201cMy dog stayed with me the whole time. He never left my side. He would paw at me and lick me in the face to keep me awake.\u201d About two hours after being bit, he fired a shot from his pistol into the air to get attention. Nothing. Back in Highlands, his wife had a gnawing feeling something was amiss. She found his truck at the trailhead around 4:30, and returned to town for help. Around 5:30, a rescue attempt was finally underway. \u201cJust so happens around 5:30, I had pretty much given in that I wasn\u2019t going to make it out alive. So I went ahead and made a goodbye video to my family with my phone. I recorded about a three-minute video; I couldn\u2019t talk clearly because my throat was so swollen.\u201d It was getting dark, and Boone start to growl. Vuncannon saw a black blur moving his way and feared a bear was coming to finish the rattlesnake\u2019s job.  What to do if a rattlesnake bites you  \u201cIf you are bitten, you need to seek medical attention as quickly as possible,\u201d Clamp said. \u201cIf you know it\u2019s a really serious bite, you should probably call EMS to come get you.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll know if you have a serious bite in just a couple of minutes. \u2026 You can start to feel tingling in your face.\u201d According to the California Poison Control System, other symptoms could include: \u2022 Extreme pain and swelling at the bite\u2022 Lots of bleeding\u2022 Nausea, lightheadedness and drooling\u2022 Swelling in the mouth and throat And if you can\u2019t make that SOS call? \u201cKeep your heartbeat as low as possible. It takes a while for the venom to work. Don\u2019t run. [But] get yourself somewhere you can get a signal as soon as possible,\u201d Clamp said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to really help you from the venom except the serum.\u201d  The snakebite victim should stay as calm as possible and deep breathe, Andrews said. If someone can stay with the victim, that person should talk to them and keep them from falling asleep.  Take notes or voice record on a smartphone what happened, she said. If possible, use a marker or pen and circle where you were bitten in case of swelling. They\u2019ll need to know the bite point at the hospital. Remove jewelry such as rings and tight clothing before you start to swell, the Mayo Clinic says.  What not to do Andrews said don\u2019t employ the out-of-date Boy Scout advice of cut-and-suck (cutting an X at the bite area and sucking the venom out by mouth or suction cups). \u201cIt\u2019s very ineffective,\u201d she said, adding people are likely to do more damage from the knife cut than from the snake bite.  Don\u2019t try to kill the snake to bring to the hospital, Andrews said, and don\u2019t take a picture of it unless you can do so easily. \u201cDon\u2019t comprise your safety by forcing another interaction with an already defensive rattlesnake.\u201d   Clamp, Andrews and other experts say do not apply a tourniquet to a pit viper bite (which is something Vuncannon did). That venom is \u201cconcentrated, and it works like an acid. It breaks down blood vessels and multiple skin tissues,\u201d Clamp said. \u201cAnd if you confine that venom in that area, you\u2019re apt to lose a limb from that. If you allow it to spread, you\u2019re more apt to keep your hand or fingers.\u201d In updated advice, the Boy Scouts and other experts say don\u2019t apply ice or cold packs to the bite and don\u2019t use Advil, Motrin or other nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs. Clamp and Andrews said your response should be the same no matter which type of pit viper bites you. \u201cThe best emergency response to a snakebite is car keys and a cell phone,\u201d Andrews said. Vuncannon\u2019s rescue and recovery   Fortunately, that was not a bear Vuncannon saw but a rescuer\u2019s black lab. However, it was getting dark, and Vuncannon was getting worse.  A helicopter couldn\u2019t be used because of the thick canopy. Vuncannon was too far gone to be slowly carried out. So he was moved by motorcycle, strapped to a driver and held up by paramedics walking on either side. That took three hours.  More than 11 hours after he first got bit, he made it to Mission Hospital in Asheville, but he had already gone into cardiac arrest. Doctors had bad news for his family. Vuncannon had less than a 5% chance to survive. His rescue was one miracle, and he needed a second one. He got around a dozen antivenom treatments and other medical interventions. Vuncannon was in a coma for three days but pulled through. \u201cIt took me a total of about three months to fully recover enough to where I could actually walk and have the energy to get around.\u201d He later learned it was a timber rattlesnake that bit him and that it directly hit a vein, which made the venom spread more rapidly but later spared him from tissue damage.  What Vuncannon learned He\u2019s back on the trails, but he carries a satellite phone, especially on deeper trails. He\u2019s also more likely to find someone to hike with him. If he goes alone, it\u2019s on wider, well-maintained trails. \u201cAnd I also carry hiking poles with me to brush the side of the trail just in case. Let someone know exactly where you\u2019re going, when you\u2019ll be back.\u201d He now has three grandchildren. \u201cI look forward to teaching them about the wilderness and the outdoors and how to avoid snake bites and dangerous encounters.\u201d  Andrews applauds learning about snakes, so that you can keep your family safe and \u201cactually enjoy a venomous snake sighting, something that is comparatively rare and can be pretty special.\u201d Clamp pointed out pit vipers can be lifesavers, too. They\u2019re important to us \u201cbecause a tremendous amount of research has been done with different venoms,\u201d noting some FDA-approved, lifesaving drugs are derived from snake venom.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/article/how-to-survive-rattlesnake-bite/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "2022_07_03_travel_drowning-water-safety-tips-wellness", "text": "On Good Friday 2017, Wyatt Werneth got a call from his wife, who had gone grocery shopping with their daughter: The car\u2019s broken down. Please rescue us. Werneth hopped in his vehicle to assist, driving by Patrick Space Force Base near Cape Canaveral, Florida. From the A1A highway, Werneth said you can see the ocean. What he saw next was a twist of fate that led to a much more urgent kind of rescue. \u201cI could see someone waving in traffic as I was going by. \u2026 I pulled in to see what was going on; I had the immediate instinct that something was happening in the water,\u201d Werneth recalled to CNN Travel. \u201cWhen I came over the berm, I did not realize what I was getting into. There were multiple people in the water.\u201d And they were in trouble. Very serious trouble. Rip current kind of trouble. The scene would send chills of dread down anyone\u2019s spine \u2014 but at least Werneth was prepared. He is an experienced lifeguard instructor and had water rescue equipment with him.  But with at least five people struggling in a vicious Atlantic rip current, how would he possibly save them all? The statistics are grim Rip currents could be a major hazard along much of the US Gulf Coast this weekend because of Hurricane Beryl. And with temperatures so high, the desire to take a dip in the water will be strong. Be cautious, check local conditions and see below for more details about what to do if you\u2019re caught in one. Whether it\u2019s from these potentially dangerous currents, seemingly placid lakes or swimming pools, the drowning statistics from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are shocking. In the CDC\u2019s most recently updated numbers, more than 4,000 fatal unintentional drownings happen every year in the United States (including boating incidents). That is an average of 11 drowning deaths per day. July tends to be the peak month for deaths. From 2018 to 2021, the states with the most drowning deaths per 100,000 people were the following: 1. Alaska2. Hawaii3. Montana4. Louisiana5. Florida Your odds of drowning are much, much higher than being attacked by a shark or an alligator. World drowning statistics are even more shocking. There are an estimated 236,000 annual drowning deaths worldwide, according to the UN\u2019s World Health Organization. That comes out to an average of 647 people per day. And then there are the even more numerous nonfatal drownings. The CDC says people who survive a drowning incident have a range of outcomes: \u201cFrom no injuries to very serious injuries or permanent disability.\u201d The tragedy is many of these deaths and injuries are preventable, experts say. What can you do to enjoy the water \u2014 be it ocean, river, lake or swimming pool \u2014 safely and not join the ranks of drowning deaths? Turns out, a lot. Who is most at risk? Knowing who is likely to drown is critical. At-risk groups need the most attention. In the United States, those include the following: \u2022 The youngest people: Children 1 to 4 have the highest drowning rates, the CDC says, mostly in swimming pools. \u2022 Males: They account for nearly 80% of fatal drownings in the United States. More risk-taking behaviors and alcohol use are cited as reasons. Across the world, WHO reports males have twice the fatal drowning rate of females. \u2022 People with seizure disorders: People with conditions such as epilepsy are at a higher risk for drowning, and that can happen in a bathtub. Drowning prevention tips The CDC emphasizes the importance of learning basic water safety skills, saying formal lessons can reduce the risk of drowning.  However, \u201cchildren who have had swimming lessons still need close and constant supervision when in or around water,\u201d the agency notes. Don\u2019t get distracted by TV, books or the phone when watching children in the water.  If you\u2019re drinking alcoholic beverages, stay out of the water and don\u2019t go boating. Impaired judgment and slow reactions can lead to tragedy. People in boats and weaker swimmers should wear life jackets, especially in open water. And keep an eye on the weather. Exit if there\u2019s a thunderstorm or heavy rains. Know the water environments Understand the waters you\u2019re about to enter. Different bodies of water carry different types of dangers: OCEAN RIP CURRENTS Rip currents flow away from shore. They often form at breaks in sandbars and close to piers and rock groins.  Look for signs of a rip current before entering, says the United States Lifesaving Association. That can be \u201ca narrow gap of darker, seemingly calmer water between areas of breaking waves and whitewater,\u201d a difference in water color or \u201ca line of foam, seaweed or debris moving seaward.\u201d Here\u2019s what to do you\u2019re caught in one: \u2022 Stay calm. Rip currents don\u2019t pull you underwater but do sweep you farther from shore. \u2022 Don\u2019t swim against the current. Try to escape by \u201cswimming out of the current in a direction following the shoreline,\u201d the USLA says. You may be able to escape by floating or treading water and ride the current out.  \u2022 If you\u2019re in trouble, yell and wave for help. If you\u2019re not trained, don\u2019t try to rescue people yourself. Seek a lifeguard, call 911 or throw a flotation device their way. Direct the person to swim parallel to the shoreline to escape. OTHER OCEAN TIPS The National Weather Service warns swimmers to watch out for \u201cshorebreak\u201d waves. They crash directly onto the sand and can batter and disorient swimmers. \u201cWhen in doubt, don\u2019t go out,\u201d said Wyatt Werneth, who is also the public service spokesperson for the American Lifeguard Association. Swim Guide advises people to swim in the hour before or the hour after low tide or high tide when waters are generally calmer. (But conditions can vary beach to beach). RIVERS Tubing and other activities are popular in rivers. But swift currents and obstacles below the surface or debris can be hazardous.  Werneth said to research the river before you enter. LAKES AND PONDS The placid waters of lakes and ponds can lull waders and swimmers into a false sense of security. Sharp, sudden dropoffs and debris under the water can startle or entangle people, Werneth said, leading to panic and drowning. He said go in with a swim buddy. Dive only in designated areas. The USLA says enter unknown waters feet first to avoid striking your head. Swimmers shouldn\u2019t stray into areas where personal watercraft and boats are speeding by. SWIMMING POOLS The National Drowing Prevention Alliance has this advice for pool owners: \u201cfour-sided fencing with self-closing self-latching gates, door and window alarms, and safety covers can help make sure kids don\u2019t get to the water unsupervised.\u201d And even if your children know how to swim, adults should still maintain a careful watch. Keep flotation devices on hand. BOATING The National Park Service\u2019s \u201cOperation Dry Water\u201d reminds people that all vessels must carry personal flotation devices. National lifeguard shortage Werneth, who is also a spokesman for the American Lifeguard Association, has warned of an ongoing lifeguard shortage in the United States for years now. A June 15, 2024, news release from the ALA called the shortage in Florida \u201cdisturbing.\u201d Werneth said the group\u2019s message has always been \u201cswim in front of a lifeguard.\u201d But he said the reality of the shortage is prompting a new one: \u201cLearn to swim, America.\u201d \u201cWe want people to self-lifeguard. Assign someone in your family to be a water watcher. Have that person learn CPR.\u201d And if someone can\u2019t swim and still wants to wade, \u201cput a life jacket on them. That\u2019s going to make a difference.\u201d Werneth said that if you plan on going to a destination that features water activities, go online first to find out the lifeguard situation and adapt your plans as needed. Some pools, lakes and beaches might not even be open.  Operation Rescue Back in 2017 at that Florida beach, Werneth\u2019s task was daunting. But he had a cool head, decades of experience \u2014 and fortunately, a second experienced helper on hand whom he later learned was from the Air Force. \u201cHe was single-handedly pulling people out before I even got there. \u2026 That Air Force guy was kind of coming back with one. I saw that he had one that was kind of going unconscious, and I immediately jumped in the water, swam out, grabbed the unconscious person and got him out.\u201d Werneth guesses that they were about 50 yards out, and he recalls they ended up pulling five male teens out of the water. They weren\u2019t even in swimming attire, Werneth said, leading him to think it was a spur-of-the-moment decision to enter the ocean. Would the group have died without the rescue, which left him exhausted? \u201cI assure you they all would have. \u2026 These people were going in to help each other, and it caused a chain reaction. Do not go into the water to assist anyone without a flotation device,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was perfect timing that I showed up and happened to be there to help those guys.\u201d All because the family car had broken down. But not everyone can rely on luck. In the end, you need \u201cwater confidence,\u201d gained by experience and respect for the water. \u201cThe fear is what generates the panic which generates the drowning.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/07/03/travel/drowning-water-safety-tips-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_mount-fuji-japan-visitor-cap-tourist-tax-intl-hnk", "text": "Mount Fuji, a UNESCO World Heritage site and an icon of Japan, has put new regulations in place for climbers amid concerns about overcrowding. Beginning July 1, climbers must pay 2,000 yen ($12.40) per person, with a daily maximum of 4,000 climbers per day. \u201cBy strongly promoting comprehensive safety measures for climbing Mount Fuji, we will ensure that Mount Fuji, a treasure of the world, is passed on to future generations,\u201d said Koutaro Nagasaki, governor of Yamanashi Prefecture, when announcing the new regulations earlier this year. \u201cIn order to revive traditional mountain climbing from the foot of Mount Fuji, we will gain a detailed understanding of the Fuji-ko and Oshi culture that supported Mount Fuji worship. We look to link these cultures to this mountain climbing, as it is rooted in the cultural values of the religion.\u201d Fuji-ko is a religion specific to the mountain. Human traffic jams, foothills littered with garbage and inappropriately attired hikers \u2013 some attempting the ascent in sandals - are among the issues plaguing the popular Japanese site. In addition, there will be new guides who manage safety on and around the trails. They will inform climbers when they\u2019re violating etiquette on the mountain, such as sleeping by the side of the trail, starting a fire or wearing unsuitable clothing. According to prefectural data, five million people hiked Mount Fuji in 2019, a rise of three million from 2012. \u201cOvertourism \u2013 and all the subsequent consequences like rubbish, rising CO2 emissions and reckless hikers \u2013 is the biggest problem facing Mount Fuji,\u201d Masatake Izumi, a Yamanashi prefectural government official, told CNN Travel last year. In 2023, a volunteer named Tomoyo Takahashi told CNN she would ask visitors to voluntarily contribute 1,000 yen ($6.20) toward maintaining the mountain. \u201cNot everyone pays the 1,000 yen, and it makes me sad. There should be a mandatory entrance fee that\u2019s much much higher so only visitors who truly appreciate Mount Fuji\u2019s heritage come,\u201d she said at the time. Now, Takahashi will get her wish. The new rules, though, only apply in Yamanashi prefecture, which is where the more popular hiking trails are. Fuji is also located in Shizuoka prefecture, which has not yet implemented any taxes or visitor limits. Governor Nagasaki told reporters that he and the governor of Shizuoka would meet at the end of the climbing season to compare notes. Japan\u2019s tourism headaches Overtourism has become a bigger issue in Japan since the country reopened following the pandemic. In Kyoto, locals in the historic Gion quarter have expressed their concern with tourists who flock there to photograph and sometimes harass the geisha who live and work there, earning the nickname \u201cgeisha paparazzi.\u201d While the city has put up signs and placards asking visitors not to photograph geisha, some locals told CNN Travel that it wasn\u2019t enough. One suggestion offered by the neighborhood council is issuing fines or tickets. And the town of Hatsukaichi, in Hiroshima prefecture in southwestern Japan, has been affected too. The small town is home to the famous orange \u201cfloating shrine\u201d torii gate, which is part of a 1,400-year-old Shinto complex. In October 2023, the town began charging 100 yen (62 cents) per visitor to the shrine. The money from the \u201ctourist tax\u201d goes toward maintaining the site and its infrastructure.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/mount-fuji-japan-visitor-cap-tourist-tax-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_travel_paris-chefs-immigrants-national-rally", "text": "Located on the famous Rue Bretagne \u2013 known as one of the best bar streets in Paris \u2013 the terrace of Le Pinardier is always busy on summer evenings.  It\u2019s a quintessentially French experience - regulars ordering the wines of the day alongside cheese and charcuterie - but one only made possible by one of the most divisive issues in the country right now: immigration. At Le Pinardier, those food orders from the sunny terrace quickly end up 70 feet away, in the kitchen, in the hands of 24-year-old chef, Sazal Saha. Originally from the city of Kuhlna in Bangladesh, Saha is in his fifth year at Le Pinardier after training in catering for two years at the Joliet-Curie School in northern France. He\u2019s typically the only person working in the kitchen, which means he does everything: buying the produce, preparing ingredients, cooking, washing the dishes and cleaning. \u201cManaging the kitchen is not easy when you\u2019re working alone,\u201d Saha told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s so complicated, sometimes I get tired, but I\u2019m used to it,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cWhen I first moved to France, I didn\u2019t know anything about cheese, but I know almost everything about them now,\u201d he said. One key reason behind Saha\u2019s decision to become a cook in the French capital is because he saw the huge demand from the industry. A job French people don\u2019t want? Across France and especially in Paris, hospitality is one of the industries that is most heavily reliant on immigrant workers. Roughly 25% of the cooks in France are immigrants from outside of the European Union, the then French Labor Minister Olivier Dussopt told Europe 1 radio at the beginning of 2024. Half of the 86,000-plus chefs in the French capital are immigrants, according to data published by the French National Institute of Statistic and Economic Studies in 2022. They\u2019re the main force supporting the gastronomic landscape of the French capital, feeding and delighting tourists from across the globe. \u201cMost of the people working in kitchens [in Paris] are either from Bangladesh or Sri Lanka,\u201d said Florian Mousson, owner of Le Pinardier. Born and raised in a family of generations of restaurant owners in the southern city of Marseille, Mousson believes that his business would not survive without immigrant workers. Yet, in this month\u2019s French parliamentary elections, which enters a second round vote this weekend, anti-immigration sentiment is seen as one of the factors driving the popularity of far-right party Rassemblement National (National Rally). In Paris, kitchen workers are mostly originally from South Asia, like Saha. In Mousson\u2019s hometown Marseille and many places in the south of France, restaurants and bars rely on immigrants from the Comoros, a former French colony in the Indian Ocean. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough job. You work standing up, you work evenings and weekends, you put in long hours, and it\u2019s very hot in the kitchen. Often in Paris, the kitchens are very small, so it\u2019s a very strenuous job,\u201d Mousson said. \u201cThere are fewer and fewer French people who are willing to do this job,\u201d he added. He hired Saha shortly after he opened Le Pinardier in 2019, making contact through a website called Leboncoin, the French version of Craigslist. Mousson says that he\u2019s not only a good cook, but a tough worker and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 a team player. Some might argue that restaurant owners prefer to hire immigrants because they cost less, but for Mousson that is not the case. \u201cI don\u2019t care if my cook is French or a foreigner. But when you put out an ad looking for a chef, for every eight or nine foreign CVs you receive, you get one French CV, so even statistically speaking you\u2019re more likely to hire a foreigner,\u201d he said. Saha earns a good salary due to the long hours he has to work. Mousson says that it\u2019s not low salaries that dictate who works in the kitchen; it\u2019s whether the person has the sticking power for such a demanding position. Mousson\u2019s first chef was French. But she resigned after only three days because she wanted a job where she can solely focus on cooking and not do the rest of the job \u2013 cleaning the kitchen, cleaning dishes and all the rest. \u201cFor a small business like us, we cannot afford to hire multiple people in the kitchen,\u201d Mousson said. \u2018I\u2019m a little worried\u2019 Saha likes Paris. Over the past five years, cooking for Parisians and tourists has allowed him to buy an apartment in a suburb and make a living in the French capital. But now the looming possibility of the far right coming to power is keeping him up at night. \u201cI am a little worried. I believe their decision is not correct,\u201d he said, referring to the immigration policies and rhetoric he saw on TV the weekend before. National Rally won a record 33.15% of the vote, leading the race following the first round of French parliamentary elections on June 30, according to data published by the French Interior Ministry. While it remains to be seen if the party can capture an absolute majority in the French National Assembly, it will almost certainly become the biggest force in the new parliament. Running on a \u201cFrance first\u201d agenda, National Rally is calling for much stricter control on immigration, both legal and illegal. It also wants to give French citizens preferential treatment in the social welfare system. \u201cWe are here, we are not doing bad things, we are working here, we are paying taxes, we are paying everything like all French people,\u201d Saha said. \u201cWhy are they making decisions that are so hard on immigration? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d But this doesn\u2019t stop him from looking forwards to his future life in France, a country that he loves. \u201cI am proud to work in a French restaurant. I like it. I love it,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/travel/paris-chefs-immigrants-national-rally/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_article_eva-longoria-searching-for-mexico-restaurants", "text": "You\u2019ll no doubt be hungry after watching \u201cEva Longoria: Searching for Mexico.\u201d Every episode is full of mouthwatering regional specialties prepared by chefs all over the country. For those wanting to follow in Eva Longoria\u2019s footsteps, below is a guide to the restaurants and locations she visited. Veracruz: Cradle of Mexican gastronomy Longoria visits the coastal state of Veracuz. Its position along some 400 miles (645 kilometers) of the Caribbean Sea made it a focal point for military conflict \u2013 and the collision of food cultures. \u201cThe people of Veracruz took this treasure trove of ingredients passing in and out of the port and created a whole new cuisine,\u201d Longoria said. \u2022 Longoria met chef Erik Guerrero, who aims to make fishing more sustainable in Veracruz, at Namik restaurant, where they enjoyed ceviche with hot beans and soft shell crab taco. \u2022 Next up, she joined actor and friend Ana de la Reguera for some coffee at historic Caf\u00e9 La Parroquia, Veracruz Port. Tap on the glass three times to ring for milk. \u2022 She headed to the lush inland mountains to meet coffee farming expert Itzel Mendoza at Cafetal Privado en Coetzala to learn how the precious bean is grown. There, they gathered flowers in the fields to be added to chicken stew, a salsa and a palm flower fritter. \u2022 Back in Veracruz Port, she met food historian Nidia Hern\u00e1ndez Medel at Chuchumb\u00e9, a cultural center, to cook some fried yucca, which is traced back to the city\u2019s African slave era.  \u2022 It\u2019s back out of the city to meet with vanilla farmer Norma Gaya, of Gaya Vanilla and Spices, for some vanilla chicken. \u2022 At El Tajin ruins, a Totonac settlement, Longoria met cook Do\u00f1a Marta. She\u2019s the founder of Smoke Women, which keeps ancient Totonac traditions alive. They enjoyed alcamaya (fresh-water shrimp) stew and mushroom empanadas. \u2022  Chef Luis Palmeros, a rising star on the Mexican food scene, introduces Longoria to traditional cook Do\u00f1a Rocio at Cuarto Blanco Market in the inland city of Xalapa (the capital of Veracruz state), for a traditional stuffed jalape\u00f1o. He then takes Longoria to his restaurant, El Cuarto Blanco, for his modern take on the dish. Jalisco: Birthplace of traditions \u2022 At Tortas Ahogadas El Pr\u00edncipe Heredero in Guadalajara, Longoria samples a torta ahogada \u2013 the region\u2019s beloved \u201cdrowned\u201d sandwich. \u2022 In Guadalajara\u2019s Santa Teresita neighborhood, Longoria samples a new preparation of native ingredient chinchayote at Xokol, a restaurant run by chefs \u00d3scar Segundo and Xrysw Ruelas D\u00edaz. \u2022 Longoria attends a charreada, a Mexican rodeo, that takes place at Lienzo Charro Charros De Jalisco. Afterward, she sampled birria, the celebrated goat stew from Jalisco, at the clubhouse. \u2022 Chef Fabian Delgado Padilla treats Longoria to mole with pork belly at his restaurant palReal in Guadlajara\u2019s Colonia Americana neighborhood. \u2022 At Lake Chapala, about 30 miles south of Guadalajara, Longoria meets with members of one of the oldest indigenous groups in Mexico, the Coca people, to talk about their fight to preserve their way of life and history on the lake. They feast on local fish called charales. \u2022 Longoria meets friends Mariana Padilla and Alejandra Pelayo at traditional cantina La Iberia in Guadalajara. Women weren\u2019t allowed in cantinas until the 1980s, Longoria said. \u2022 Then she heads to to the town of Tequila, where Salvador Rosales Trejo shows her how tequila is produced by Tequila Cascahuin using traditional methods. \u2022 Longoria and chef Fabian Delgado Padilla visit Yunaites, his casual restaurant inside a municipal market in Guadalajara, for gorditas topped with pork and mole. Nuevo Le\u00f3n: Where beef is king Say adios to vegetables for a while. Nuevo Le\u00f3n is the land of meat. In this state in northeast Mexico, carne asada is a go-to meal. And it\u2019s the cuisine Longoria grew up with in Texas.  \u2022 In Monterrey, Longoria met up with Alejandro Guti\u00e9rrez, founder of the Mexican Society of Grill Masters, to try the region\u2019s specialty: carne asada (grilled meat). In August, there\u2019s a grill master competition in Santiago, outside of Monterrey. \u2022 Tacos Do\u00f1a Mary La Gritona has been serving breakfast tacos in Monterrey for nearly 20 years. \u201cThese are the best tortillas I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d said Longoria. \u2022 El Jonuco restaurant celebrates the products of Nuevo Le\u00f3n with a focus on seasonal ingredients. They\u2019re known for their cabrito (roasted goat). The restaurant celebrates the little-known history of crypto-Judaism in the region, Longoria said. \u2022 Dona Lupita\u2019s Caf\u00e9, located in the backyard of her home right next to Highway 85 south of Monterrey, is famed for its legendary tamales. \u2022 La Divinita bakery is one of the most successful bakery chains in Monterrey. The founder uses local oranges to make a traditional dessert with Longoria. \u2022 Koli restaurant, run by the three Rivera Rio brothers, is a fine dining restaurant that aims to tell the story of Nuevo Le\u00f3n. Oaxaca: A gastronomic capital Nestled within three vast mountain ranges, Oaxaca is a magnet for food lovers in the know.  A thrill of any visit here is sampling the moles, as well as dishes such as tlayudas (thin Oaxacan \u201cpizzas\u201d), spicy hot chocolate and asado grilled in smoky market stalls. \u201cIt is on another level gastronomically, one of the best places I\u2019ve been to in the world,\u201d Longoria said. \u2022 Mercado de Abastos is a giant market on the edge of Oaxaca City. If you want your chocolate fix, the mercado is still the place to come. This region is known for its moles \u2013 complex sauces featuring many blended ingredients.  \u2022 Casa Oaxaca makes Oaxaca\u2019s famous mole negro drizzled over turkey breast. Longoria called it a magnificently complex and sophisticated sauce. \u2022 At Las Quince Letras, chef Celia Flori\u00e1n made Longoria quesillo \u2013 a stretched Oaxacan cheese --  with crickets and edible flowers. \u2022 In the area of Oaxaca located on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, several muxes, who identify as a third gender and are guardians of Zapotecan cuisine, cooked up stuffed pork with pineapple served alongside pureed potatoes. Longoria called it \u201cthe perfect combination.\u201d \u2022 The farming town of Santa Ana Zegache is the unassuming epicenter of corn. Corn has been worshipped for over 6,000 years and is still the beating heart of Mexican cuisine.  \u2022 In San Baltazar Chichicapam, Longoria visited a palenque (agave farm) run by Do\u00f1a Berta, one of very few female mezcaleras. The farm produces mezcal, the smoky liquor for which this region is famed. \u2022 La Cocina de Humo is a hip restaurant using local ingredients. Chef Thalia Barrios Garc\u00eda is known for her heirloom tomato salad with beet puree and herbal dressing. Longoria said it\u2019s the \u201cperfect dish.\u201d Here\u2019s the recipe.   Yucat\u00e1n: Defined by the Maya Mayan DNA runs through the recipes in Yucat\u00e1n, which has the largest Maya population in Mexico.  The state is located along the Gulf of Mexico and is surrounded by dense forests that isolate it off from the rest of the country. The Maya thrived here for thousands of years before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors in the 1500s. The region\u2019s geography and turbulent history have had a significant impact on the cuisine. \u2022 Ixi\u2019im mixes modern and ancestral techniques and flavors. The restaurant has its own version of the most famous dish from the Yucat\u00e1n, cochinita pibil. Chef Luis Ronz\u00f3n slow-cooks pork underground after it\u2019s marinated in sour orange and spices.  \u2022 Condimentos Enrique is a family-run business that sells recados (spice pastes) in Mercado de Santiago in M\u00e9rida. \u2022 At Huniik, which means \u201cunique spirit\u201d in Maya, chef Roberto Sol\u00eds makes onion tempura with black recado. \u201cI have never had anything like this. This is gorgeous, and it\u2019s delicious,\u201d said Longoria.  \u2022 In his home in Xoc\u00e9n, chef Alberto Kuku prepared one of the oldest dishes, Mayan chicken tamales, for Hanal Pix\u00e1n, a holiday celebrated by the Maya people that means \u201cfood for the souls.\u201d The food honoring the dead \u201ccan easily be carried back to the underworld,\u201d he said. \u2022 Chef Regina Escalante, who runs Merci in M\u00e9rida, showed Longoria how to make grilled seabass with mango, avocado and flor de sal. \u201cI\u2019d have this as my last meal on Earth,\u201d said Longoria. Here\u2019s the recipe. \u2022 At Uxmal, Mayan archaeologist Don Pepe cooked up smoked pork and bean stew. It cooks underground for 12 hours.  \u2022 Kinich in Izamal is famous for its queso relleno. A key ingredient is, surprisingly, Dutch cheese. See how it\u2019s made:  Mexico City: The city of tacos \u201cIt\u2019s crazy, it\u2019s crowded, it\u2019s noisy \u2013 and I love it!\u201d Longoria said as she walked the streets of Mexico City, where she lives part-time with her family. This region was once the capital of the mighty Aztec empire, known as Tenochtitl\u00e1n until the Spanish invaded about 500 years ago and changed its name to Mexico City. Here are the places Eva Longoria visited in the episode: \u2022 Tomasa is a Mexican bakery known for its conchas, a fluffy sweet bread with a crunchy topping.  \u2022 El Huequito in the Historic Center serves up delicious al pastor tacos, which are a staple in Mexico City. \u2022 Tacos Los Alexis is sizzling hot in the taco world. Owner Alexis Ayala uses his five-star culinary training to transform traditional recipes from his childhood into to-die-for gourmet tacos.  \u2022 Contramar in Roma, the bohemian part of town, is one of Longoria\u2019s favorite restaurants. Owner and chef Gabriela C\u00e1mara made her signature dish: pescado a la talla. \u2022 M\u00e1ximo Bistrot, a gourmet restaurant that marries French and Mexican cuisine, is run by chef Eduardo \u201cLalo\u201d Garc\u00eda. For Longoria, he made a roasted beet salad with rocket and wilted purslane. Best known as a weed, purslane is nonetheless edible and very nutritious. \u2022 Mercado de Jamaica is one of hundreds of markets in the city. At the street food stalls, Longoria tried green chorizo tacos and tlacoyos, thick oval-shaped tortillas typically stuffed with beans or cheese. \u2022 Casa Tochan refugee shelter is the first shelter for immigrants in Mexico City. The residents cook dishes from their homeland to share with their housemates.  \u2022 El Moro is an institution famous for its churros and chocolate. \u2022 Hiyoko restaurant in Little Tokyo cooks up a Mexican-Japanese fusion. Chef and restaurateur Edo L\u00f3pez whipped up tapioca tostadas, chicken skewers with ants and duck donburi.  After each episode, we\u2019ll add to this story with the latest locations where you can sample food featured in \u201cSearching for Mexico.\u201d  Sign up for CNN\u2019s Unlocking Mexico newsletter.

{"id": "travel_avoid-stupid-american-stereotype-traveling-abroad", "text": "If you watch shows such as \u201cEmily in Paris,\u201d you can be forgiven for thinking the world is enchanted by Americans who travel abroad. Silly gaffes, like mistaking a public urinal for a monument and taking selfies in front of it, come across as charming quirks on television. However, as a single American woman who moved to Europe and made a LOT of faux pas of my own, I can assure you that the real world is definitely not amused. It\u2019s a hard pill to swallow, but sadly, we\u2019ve gained a reputation around the world for being, well, \u201cstupid Americans.\u201d Is it offensive? Yes. Could we get upset about it? Sure. But with tens of millions of Americans traveling abroad every year, the likelihood is that you\u2019ll encounter us wherever you are in the world. Therefore, our reputation is completely understandable. The reality is, we ALL do \u201cstupid\u201d things, especially when we are in foreign places and we don\u2019t know the local customs, cultures or surroundings. No one is immune from this humiliation, not even genius scholars. However, smart travelers know that doing \u201cstupid\u201d things abroad can not only be disrespectful and embarrassing, but it can put you at risk of being arrested, hurt or the victim of crime. That\u2019s why, instead of letting labels upset me, I choose to focus on how I can become a master traveler. After 20-plus years of exploring the world, I think I\u2019ve managed to crack it. So, here are my top 10 tips on how you can avoid the \u201cstupid American\u201d stereotype and become a \u201cSmart American\u201d abroad. Read social cues People in most countries are extremely polite. They would never tell you that what you are doing is offensive or socially unacceptable. Instead, they will most likely smile and nod, before quickly changing the topic, running away or ghosting you. This behavior definitely makes for a very civilized society, but if you\u2019re a tell-it-like-it-is New Yorker like me, it can be very hard to pick up on social cues. For years, I foolishly thought that what I was saying or doing was of genuine interest to those around me. I had no idea that I was embarrassing myself and chasing people away. As you meet people abroad, try to notice if they are genuinely interested (for example, asking lots of follow-up questions, making eye contact, building on your stories, asking to join in, etc.), or if they are just being polite. If your Spidey sense starts to tingle, it\u2019s probably time to change the subject or move on to a new activity. Keep the volume down It is very true that most Americans have a wonderful zest for life. We don\u2019t think twice about gabbing away with friends (or strangers) on public transportation or laughing whole-heartedly at the dinner table. That\u2019s just our way of being friendly. However, in many places around the world, speaking loudly is considered extremely rude and highly uncommon. It\u2019s not unusual to visit major cities and see people traveling in complete silence while on a packed train. You\u2019ll also notice that you can\u2019t hear the conversation at the table sitting directly next to you in a restaurant. When I first moved to Europe, people would regularly ask, \u201cWhy are you shouting?\u201d I was always shocked. I was just using my normal speaking voice! I didn\u2019t think I was being loud at all. Turns out, I was indeed shouting, at least relative to everyone else around me (imagine how traumatized they\u2019d all be if I did actually shout.). Over the years, I\u2019ve learned to become more aware of my surroundings and to control my volume level accordingly. It\u2019s a skill I will always struggle with, as my default level is apparently a nine out of 10 to most, but it\u2019s also a skill that has had a major positive impact on my business, romantic and personal relationships. Don\u2019t get me wrong, when I\u2019m home in New York, I let it all out and no one even notices. However, when I\u2019m traveling abroad, I\u2019m always careful to keep it to, what feels like, a quiet whisper. Blend in Normally, I\u2019m all for originality and standing out in a crowd. However, when you\u2019re traveling abroad, even to a place you know well, standing out is like wearing a flashing sign that says, \u201cI\u2019m a tourist, come take advantage of me!\u201d Whether it\u2019s pickpockets, grifters or someone more nefarious, there are always bad actors lurking about, looking for fresh prey. Unfortunately, criminals can often spot an American a mile away by either their accent (another reason to keep the volume of your voice down) or their fashion (khakis, golf shirts, sneakers, baseball hats and white socks are usually dead giveaways.) The moment these predators know you\u2019re from out of town, they will pounce. That\u2019s why it\u2019s smart to blend in with the locals and avoid drawing any sort of attention to yourself. Not only will it make you a smart American, it\u2019ll also make you a safer American.\u00a0 Be curious No one likes a know-it-all. That\u2019s why one of the best ways to win people over and skyrocket your knowledge is to be curious. Be a sponge and absorb as much new information as possible. Being genuinely interested in a country, its people, its culture and everyday life is one of the most flattering ways to show respect and connect with a community. Judge Judy always says, \u201cYou have two ears and one mouth for a reason.\u201d In other words, listen twice as much as you talk. \u00a0If you can listen without feeling the need to talk about \u201chow we do things back home\u201d or show off all the things you read in a book, then you will make friends everywhere you go. In fact, the more questions you can ask, the more people will think you\u2019re intelligent! No one expects you to know everything. It\u2019s attractive when you can say, \u201cI don\u2019t know about this, please tell me more.\u201d It shows humility and opens the door for others to share their wisdom and stories with you, which will always help you grow. So, try to forget everything you know, open your mind and be curious. If you do, people will respond with kindness, appreciation and believe that you are very wise. Be street smart Every city has its own scams, and it\u2019s important for you to read up on what the most common scams are in the area you\u2019re visiting before you travel so that you can be street smart. One of the most popular scams is when a taxi driver takes the \u201clong way\u201d to get you to your destination, racking up quite the bill. Not every city has Uber. Local taxi drivers instantly know whether you\u2019re from the area or not, simply by the way you make your request when you enter their vehicle. When I traveled to Rome for the first time, I got into a cab and asked the driver, \u201cHow much to get to this hotel?\u201d He replied \u201c80 euros.\u201d I immediately told him to stop. I removed my bags, which made him very angry, and exited his car. I then called the hotel and asked, the same question. They told me it would be no more than 5 euros. The next taxi I entered, I told the driver, \u201cPlease take me to this hotel. It\u2019s just down the road so should only be around 5 euros, right?\u201d He replied, \u201cYes,\u201d and we were on our way. By letting him know I wasn\u2019t a \u201cstupid American,\u201d we were all able to live happily ever after. The point of this story is do your homework. Get an idea of prices for taxis, food, charges, tipping, etc., ahead of time so you don\u2019t get ripped off or taken advantage of. Know the local scams and know how to reject people who approach you with their games. And most of all, don\u2019t let your excitement to be in a new place lure you into a false sense of security.\u00a0 Be careful about meeting new people, especially from dating apps. Stranger danger is real. Read the news America is so vast that the news tends to focus on what\u2019s going on locally in each state, with a touch of what\u2019s happening across the rest of the country. However, it rarely features international news. As a result, many Americans often have little to no knowledge of what\u2019s going on around the world, thus unfairly adding to the \u201cstupid American\u201d stereotype. Luckily, there is a fast and easy remedy. If you\u2019re planning to travel abroad, simply read the news headlines of the country you\u2019re visiting before you travel. You don\u2019t need to know the country\u2019s full history, but it will help tremendously if you know the basics: Who is the current president / prime minister of the country? What are the hot topics and major headlines? What is the country\u2019s national sport and how is their team doing? Where is the country located on a map, and what countries surround it? Having this information available at your fingertips will not only make you look well-informed, it will help you avoid being left out of conversations. Learn some of the language Do you need to be fluent when you go abroad? Not at all. Do you need to learn the basics? Yes. Absolutely. Most major cities will have plenty of English speakers, but they won\u2019t always be around when you need them. Whether it\u2019s an emergency or just being able to order from a menu, it\u2019s important for you to know some basic words and phrases to get you through the day. I recommend you start with: \u201cHello,\u201d \u201cGoodbye,\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d \u201cPlease\u201d, \u201cHelp,\u201d \u201cSorry,\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t speak ___,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m allergic to ___,\u201d \u201cI would like to go to ____,\u201d \u201cWhere is ___\u201d and a smattering of your favorite foods. Sure, there are apps that can help, but memorizing these phrases will go a long way, not just with communication but also with cooperation. Even if you butcher the words, most people deeply appreciate it when you at least try to speak the local language. It shows respect that you made the effort, and you\u2019ll be surprised at how many doors it can unlock for you. Be an ambassador In many ways, we are all mini-ambassadors of the United States when traveling abroad. For better or worse, how we act will directly reflect, not just on us, but on all Americans. Yet, there\u2019s something in human nature that makes many people act differently when traveling abroad. It\u2019s as if something snaps inside their brains and, suddenly, they become this completely different person who can do and say things they would never consider doing in their daily lives. As you can imagine, this can lead to some bad situations (I\u2019m talking to you, Americans who were arrested for sleeping in the Eiffel Tower). While it might be tempting to take on a \u201cWhat happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas\u201d attitude when traveling abroad, I recommend you think of travel as if you are a sporting fan who is going to see your favorite team at an away game. You are a guest in their house. You can\u2019t expect the other team to have the same food, entertainment, transportation and hospitality. Your support for your team can be an automatic insult to the host team (even if you don\u2019t intend it to be insulting), and if you don\u2019t follow the rules, you\u2019re going to get kicked out of the stadium. But what brings us all together is that we all share a love of the sport. \u00a0It\u2019s the same with travel. Remember, you are a guest. Like any good visitor, you want to make sure you make a positive impression so that you are always welcomed back. Don\u2019t pack a lot of underwear One of the funniest stories I\u2019ve ever heard came from a friend who is a Swedish trumpet player. He roomed with an American while on tour. He said, the man opened his luggage and exposed over 50 pairs of underwear. The trumpet player asked, \u201cWhy have you packed so many pairs of underwear for a two-week tour?\u201d The musician replied, \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if you had washing machines in Europe.\u201d Stories like this are amusing to us, but my friend was beside himself. Do Americans really think that Europe is backward? Well, apparently, some do. If you\u2019re traveling abroad, you may be surprised to know that many countries are far more advanced that the United States in some areas. For example, there has been a high-speed 200 mph train connecting London to Paris since 1994. Yet, America still doesn\u2019t have a high-speed train network of its own. Britain and most of Europe has been using contactless card payments for everything from dining to transport since 2007. Gothenburg, Sweden, is so safe that companies display actual products in front of billboards, and no one steals the items. The list goes on.\u00a0The point here is, for most travel, you won\u2019t need to pack 50 pairs of underwear. Beat them to the punch with humor My biggest secret weapon against being called a \u201cstupid American\u201d is calling myself a \u201cstupid American\u201d first and laughing about it. Let me explain. As I said above, I accept that everyone does stupid things, and I am no exception. I\u2019ve done a LOT of really \u201cstupid\u201d things when traveling in the past, and I\u2019m sure I will do plenty more \u201cstupid\u201d things in the future. That\u2019s OK! I know in my heart that I\u2019m not actually a \u201cstupid\u201d person. So, instead of getting offended or upset about it, I just laugh and get others to laugh with me. For example, whenever I don\u2019t understand something, I\u2019m confident enough to say, \u201cSorry, I know I\u2019m being a stupid American here, but could you help me with this?\u201d I find this approach instantly disarms people. Instead of becoming frustrated, it makes them eager to help. Instead of driving a wedge between our cultures, it brings us closer together. By beating them to the punch and stating the phrase \u201cstupid American\u201d before they even have a chance to think it, it flips the script and delivers a bit of reverse psychology that makes people think and say, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not stupid. I\u2019m happy to help you.\u201d At the very least they will laugh with you, not at you. Don\u2019t believe me?\u00a0 Notice how I used this same technique with you at the beginning of this article. Believe me. Implement this tip and no one will ever roll their eyes or doubt your intelligence ever again.

{"id": "2024_07_08_travel_barcelona-tourism-protests-scli-intl", "text": "Protesters in Barcelona have sprayed visitors with water as part of a demonstration against mass tourism. Demonstrators marching through areas popular with tourists on Saturday chanted \u201ctourists go home\u201d and squirted them with water pistols, while others carried signs with slogans including \u201cBarcelona is not for sale.\u201d Thousands of protesters took to the streets of the city in the latest demonstration against mass tourism in Spain, which has seen similar actions in the Canary Islands and Mallorca recently, decrying the impact on living costs and quality of life for local people. The demonstration was organised by a group of more than 100 local organizations, led by the Assemblea de Barris pel Decreixement Turi\u0301stic (Neighborhood Assembly for Tourism Degrowth). According to official figures, almost 26 million visitors made an overnight stay in the Barcelona region in 2023, spending \u20ac12.75 billion ($13.8 billion). However, the Assemblea de Barris pel Decreixement Tur\u00edstic says that these visitors increase prices and put pressure on public services, while profits from the tourism industry are unfairly distributed and increase social inequality. It has published 13 proposals to reduce the number of visitors and transition the city to a new model of tourism, including the closure of cruise ship terminals, more regulation of tourist accommodation and an end to public spending on tourism promotion. On Saturday, the city\u2019s mayor, Jaume Collboni, highlighted a series of measures that he has announced recently to reduce the impact of mass tourism, including increasing the nightly tourist tax to \u20ac4 ($4.30) and limiting the number of cruise ship passengers. At the end of June, Collboni also announced that it would end apartment rentals for tourists by 2028 by scrapping short-term rental licenses for more than 10,000 apartments. This would help to make housing more affordable for long-term residents, according to Collboni, who said rents had increased 68% in the past 10 years, with the cost of buying a house up 38%. However, Collboni has been criticized for allowing events such as a Louis Vuitton catwalk show in architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed\u2019s Parc G\u00fcell in May, as well as the upcoming America\u2019s Cup sailing competition. The growing discontent in Barcelona echoes similar protests in other parts of Spain. In April, locals in the\u00a0Canary Islands\u00a0mobilized to protest against\u00a0excessive tourism, blaming visitors for pricing them out of their homes and causing environmental damage. These complaints are common to many tourist hot spots around the world, which have experienced record visitor numbers recently as the travel industry has roared back from a pandemic-induced downturn. Such surges may be sweet for local economies and hospitality businesses\u2019 bottom line, but they also come with notable downsides: increased noise, pollution, traffic and strain on resources; a lower quality of life for locals; and a diminished visitor experience, among others. Not surprisingly, many tourist magnets have created initiatives and restrictions intended to combat overtourism, including new or increased tourist taxes, campaigns aimed at discouraging problematic visitors and attendance caps at popular attractions.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/travel/barcelona-tourism-protests-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "travel"}}

{"id": "travel_worlds-50-best-restaurants-for-2024", "text": "Any doubts that Spain remains the fine dining center of the world may just have evaporated with the revealing of the World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants for 2024 list. Five eateries from the European nation made the list \u2013 three of them in the top five. The awards\u00a0\u2013 considered the Oscars of global fine dining \u2013 were handed out at a ceremony at the Wynn in Las Vegas on Wednesday evening, with Barcelona\u2019s Disfrutar walking away with the top prize. Ranked number two last year, it\u2019s owned and run by chefs Oriol Castro, Eduard Xatruch and Mateu Casanas. The fact that this trio met while working at the legendary El Bulli should provide a few clues as to what diners can expect \u2013 imaginative and playful dishes executed with technical mastery, such as the caviar-filled Panchino doughnut, the frozen gazpacho sandwich and squab with kombu spaghetti, almond and grape. Coming in at number two was Asador Etxebarri of Atxondo, not far from the Spanish port city of Bilbao. Under the leadership of chef Victor Arguinzoniz, it\u2019s famed for offering unbeatable barbecue that lets the quality of the ingredients shine, such as a red Palam\u00f3s prawn that\u2019s simply grilled and served on its own. But you can never count Paris out.\u00a0The French capital\u2019s Table by Bruno Verjus\u00a0squeezed into third place, while yet another restaurant from Spain \u2013 Madrid\u2019s Diverxo \u2013 took the fourth spot. Coming in at fifth was Lima\u2019s Maido, one of three restaurants from the city to make the list, giving the Peruvian capital\u2019s reputation as South America\u2019s premier dining destination yet another boost. Mexico was the big winner in North America, earning three restaurants on the list, led by Mexico City eatery Quintonil, which came in seventh. The rest of the list Securing five restaurants on the list was enough to make Spain the biggest winner of the night in Vegas. In terms of cities, Paris and Bangkok tied for first, each with four restaurants on the list. Gaggan Anand, at number nine, was the Thai capital\u2019s top entry. As for the event\u2019s host country, the US had two restaurants on this year\u2019s 50 Best list. New York City\u2019s Atomix came in 6th this year, rising two spots since last year. SingleThread, in the town of Healdsburg in California\u2019s Sonoma Valley, landed in 46th place. Three restaurants from Tokyo were awarded, with eatery S\u00e9zanne\u00a0(voted Asia\u2019s best restaurant in 2024) ranking the highest in the Japanese capital, at 15. Hong Kong saw two of its restaurants hit the list, with both making impressive moves. Wing was the city\u2019s highest new entry on the entire list, at 20, while The Chairman was the highest climber, moving from last year\u2019s 50th spot into number 26. The list is compiled based on the votes of the\u00a0The World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants Academy, which is made up of\u00a0 1,080 international restaurant industry experts including food writers and chefs, in 27 regions around the world. Restaurants can only win the top prize once, after which they\u2019re entered into a separate \u201cBest of the Best\u201d program. Members of that elite group include Geranium and Noma in Copenhagen, as well as New York\u2019s Eleven Madison Park, The Fat Duck near London, Osteria Francescana in Modena, Italy, and Mirazur in Menton, France.

{"id": "travel_when-your-home-becomes-a-tourist-attraction", "text": "Have you ever looked at a beautiful little mews house in London and thought \u201cit must be so amazing to live there?\u201d If so, you\u2019re not the only one. But for the people who actually do live in those homes, social media photography has changed what it means to live in a picturesque place. Alice Johnston is a longtime resident of Notting Hill, the London neighborhood famous for pastel-painted row houses and for being the setting of the Julia Roberts/Hugh Grant movie of the same name. Johnston,\u00a0a journalist, has complicated feelings about her Instagram-beloved \u2018hood. She lives on Portobello Road, one of the capital\u2019s most famous streets, and has witnessed all kinds of crazy behavior committed in the pursuit of the perfect snapshot. Once, she and a friend were walking his French bulldog when a tourist asked if they could \u201cborrow\u201d the pup for a quick photo op. The friend and the dog consented, the Instagrammer posed with the Frenchie in front of a bright blue door and then handed over five pounds as a thank you. Private lives, public places In that story, everybody had a good time. But there can be a darker side to living inside what some people think is a movie set. \u201cI was once woken up at 6 a.m. on Easter Sunday by French teenagers taking pictures outside,\u201d Johnston says. She shares another anecdote: \u201cOne time I was changing after I got out of the shower and there was this elderly man taking a picture (of my windows) with an iPad.\u201d Although the shutters were closed at the time, she was understandably rattled by the experience. When private homes \u2013 and the people who live in them \u2013 become tourist attractions, clashes can occur. In more rural areas, people can put up fences or other barriers to access, but when these private homes are on public streets in some of the world\u2019s busiest cities, what\u2019s a resident to do? Different communities have taken different approaches. In Hong Kong, a group of five interconnected housing estates nicknamed \u201cthe Monster Building\u201d became a huge selfie spot after it was featured in several Hollywood films, including \u201cTransformers: Age of Extinction.\u201d The mega-building is in Quarry Bay, a relatively quiet neighborhood on the eastern side of Hong Kong island that most travelers skip over. Residents of the working-class community are not able to block the building off due to the fact that there are public businesses on the ground floors. Therefore, some have taken things into their own hands by posting signs asking visitors to be respectful. A sign in English and Chinese erected by building residents reads \u201cThis is a private estate Trespassers are strictly prohibited from all kinds of activities (including but not limited to photographing, gatherings, use of drones and yelling e.t.c.). We shall not take responsibility for property damage and/or personal injury caused by any accident.\u201d However, many visitors ignore the signs or simply think of them as suggestions, and a quick scan of Instagram shows plenty of recent images taken there. Johnston says that a pale-pink house near where she lives has become such a popular photo site that the residents have given up on trying to keep people away. Instead, they\u2019ve put up a donation box asking people to contribute money to charity in exchange for snapping a photo. When your home is a piece of history Chuck Henderson\u2019s grandmother, Della, was a lover of architecture \u2013 so much that she was able to commission a home in California built by the world-renowned American architect\u00a0Frank Lloyd Wright. The Mrs. Clinton Walker House in Carmel-by-the-Sea, nicknamed \u201cthe Cabin on the Rocks,\u201d was completed in 1951 and passed into the hands of Henderson and some of his relatives when Walker died. No one lives in it full time, but the different family members and their guests take turns staying there. Wright fans will come from all over the world to try and get glimpses of some of his masterpieces. While some, like the famous Fallingwater house in Pennsylvania, are year-round attractions, others remain private residences. Many people who own homes featured in architecture textbooks have to add the cost of security measures onto other expenses like utilities and homeowners insurance. \u201cWe put these security cameras in after we had some vandalism about six or seven years ago,\u201d Henderson says. The vandalism in question wasn\u2019t graffiti, though. He explains: \u201cWe have this big wooden remnant of a tree that is placed as the centerpiece of the garden by the original landscape designer. Someone cut a notch from it. It looked clean, like someone used a chainsaw or something. One of our doors \u2013 between the carport and the main house \u2013 has a bunch of nautical cork discs in a rope net and is the counterweight for the door. That has been absconded with a couple of times.\u201d Stlll, though, Henderson and his family have the last laugh on the cork disc thieves \u2013 those weren\u2019t designed by Wright and are of little, if any, value. \u201cWe have people go walking right by the \u2018private property, no trespassing\u2019 sign. We\u2019ve had people dancing in our carport. We get a few people wandering up as a surprise, and as long as they don\u2019t do anything wrong we don\u2019t try to call the police. We\u2019re on a beach surrounded by road and don\u2019t have a lawn, but we had a family of deer.\u201d Coming to a compromise When it comes to living in a much-photographed place, some people try to take the good with the bad. Johnston tries to be sympathetic to travelers coming to her hometown, recalling how she loved taking pictures of historic neighborhoods like the Marais in Paris and Alfama in Lisbon. In fact, she recently found photos of herself as a teenager hanging out at the Notting Hill Carnival, years before she moved to the capital herself. \u201cI love to travel, so I have to be pretty understanding when people travel to where I live, and i feel lucky that it\u2019s cool enough that people want to come where I live.\u201d Henderson and his relatives have come to some compromises in order to let design buffs explore the home while also maintaining their privacy. They occasionally rent it out for photo shoots, such as a campaign by\u00a0eyewear brand Oliver Peoples. In addition, they open the home to the public one day a year to benefit the local Carmel Heritage Society. In 2021, 657 people came bought tickets and toured the property. \u201cFor us it\u2019s a tremendous pleasure to be able to share the house and see so many people happy and excited about it,\u201d says Henderson. \u201cAnd it allows us to be able to tell people when it is open. It gives them an option (to visit) and we don\u2019t have to be the Grinch.\u201d Still, it\u2019s not clear if anyone in the family changed their minds about looking after such a high-profile residence. Henderson and his relatives sold the house in 2023.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/when-your-home-becomes-a-tourist-attraction/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_article_bear-encounters-prevent-attacks-wellness", "text": "You\u2019re out for a hike, reveling in glorious nature. Suddenly, you spot a bear. And the bear has spotted you, too. Would you know what to do next? Beth Pratt sure would. She was once on the Old Gardiner Road Trail in Yellowstone National Park, enjoying her run in wild nature. Her reverie came to an end when she came upon a grizzly bear eating flowers.  \u201cI stopped. It stood on its hind legs and looked at me. I knew that wasn\u2019t a threatening gesture,\u201d she told CNN Travel. \u201cI\u2019m not kidding, it waved its paw at me as if to say, \u2018just go on your way,\u2019 and went back to eating.\u201d \u201cAnd I walked slowly away and put some distance between us, and the encounter ended fine.\u201d When it comes to dealing with bears, Pratt does have a thing or two on almost all the rest of us, though. She is the California regional executive director for the National Wildlife Federation, a job she\u2019s had for more than 10 years. She worked in Yellowstone for several years \u2013 and once saw nine grizzlies in one day there.    Finally, she lives on the border of Yosemite National Park, and bears will pass through her yard, including this one seen in the footage above in late September 2021. You can hear the enthusiasm in Pratt\u2019s voice as she shares her bear bona fides and advice to make sure bear/human encounters are delightful, not dangerous. \u201cA wild bear is a beautiful sight to see. It\u2019s incredible to see them in the wild. I never had a bad experience with bears. What I try to get people to feel is respect, not fear, for bears. The animal usually wants to avoid the encounters.\u201d  Bears in the news   Bear attacks are rare, Pratt and US National Park Service websites point out, but they do happen:  \u2022 A disable veteran survived an attack from a mother grizzly at Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming in May 2024. \u201cIt was the most violent thing I have ever experienced.\u201d \u2022 A hunter suffered serious injuries in a grizzly bear attack in British Columbia in May 2024. \u2022 Bear attacks are on the increase in Japan. \u2022 A man lost part of his jaw in a grizzly bear attack in Montana in September 2023. \u2022 Two people died in a suspected grizzly bear attack in Canada\u2019s Banff National Park in late September 2023. \u2022 Two collegiate wrestlers were mauled by a grizzly bear near Cody, Wyoming, in October 2022; they had serious injuries but survived. They illustrate the point that rare doesn\u2019t equal never. Feasts for beasts  While it pays to be diligent at any time, autumn is a particularly good season to bone up on bear facts and safety when many bears are in a phase known as hyperphagia, Pratt said. \u201cIt\u2019s a period in the fall where bears are eating anything and everything to fatten up for hibernation.\u201d  She noted mountain lions are comparatively picky eaters. Not bears.   \u201cThey eat everything: Ants. Roadkill. Flowers. Nuts. And unfortunately, human food that\u2019s not secured. Our food is very attractive to them; it\u2019s easy calories.\u201d   Combine that with the fact that some national and state parks have become very popular and crowded, and you have a recipe for potential trouble. \u201cIf more people are using public lands and more people are in the mix, there\u2019s more potential for encounters and conflict. It does concern me a little bit,\u201d Pratt said. The key is being prepared \u2013 and that\u2019s where Pratt and others in the know come in. First rule of \u2018bear fight club\u2019: Don\u2019t fight The best strategy is to never get in harm\u2019s way by enticing or provoking a wild bear. Trying to give a bear food or approaching cute cubs are particularly terrible ways to start an encounter. That\u2019s just looking for trouble. The US National Park Service site points out each bear and each encounter is different, but there are general guidelines useful in most situations. First of all, keep your distance if you happen upon a bear. Don\u2019t approach it, and give it plenty of room to walk away from you. Yellowstone tells you to stay at least 100 yards (300 feet or 91 meters) away; Shenandoah National Park in Virginia suggests 200 feet (61 meters) for its black bears. You can run afoul of the law as well as the bears if you get too close and end up paying a fine.   Other tips: \u2022 Talk calmly to yourself in low tones to identify yourself as human. \u2022 Walk with a group (we\u2019re smellier and noisier in packs) and stay on designated trails. \u2022 If you have a small child or dog, pick it up. \u2022 Don\u2019t put yourself between cubs and their mother. \u2022  Avoid direct eye contact and move away slowly, sideways if possible. Pratt said don\u2019t be alarmed if a bear stands on its hind legs; it\u2019s not considered an aggressive move. Almost all encounters are peaceful, Pratt said. Many times, people never knew they were even close to a bear, as in this YouTube video that shows two people emerging from a basement oblivious to a nearby bear.  What if a bear starts coming at you anyway?  If a bear starts making assertive moves in your direction, you have important decisions to make \u2013 and fast. First thing is: Stand your ground with bears. With either grizzlies (a subspecies of brown bears) or black bears, \u201cplease don\u2019t run. Bears can outrun anybody,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cDon\u2019t climb a tree either. They can also climb trees better than you.\u201d  New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Division of Fish and Wildlife (where the black bear population is growing) also has some tips: \u2022 Make loud noises by yelling, banging pots and pans or using an airhorn to scare bears away. \u2022 Make yourself look as large as possible by waving your arms.  \u2022 If you\u2019re with other people, stay together. Pratt said you can usually intimidate or bluff your way out of sticky bear situations, depending on the bear species and the situation.  But what if a bear is about to attack? You\u2019re now in the rarest of situations \u2013 you\u2019ve attracted a bear\u2019s attention. It didn\u2019t move off. It\u2019s started coming at you aggressively and fast. You think you\u2019re about to be attacked. What\u2019s next? One very crucial thing is to make a quick ID of the kind of bear, because your strategy is going to be different depending on the type of bear.  If it\u2019s a black bear, the NPS and Pratt have a clear message: Do not run. Do not play dead. \u201cYou want to stand your ground with black bears. Look as intimidating as possible,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cThrow things not at it but near it. Make that black bear intimidated by you. Let it know you are a big person. Pick something up; yell at it. If it attacks, fight back \u2013 aim for the face.\u201d It\u2019s a different situation with grizzlies If you\u2019re dealing with a grizzly that won\u2019t back off and an attack is imminent, you\u2019re advised to do the opposite. You should play dead. \u201cAct as unthreatening as possible with a grizzly. Play dead with a grizzly if it starts to attack,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cTuck and cover. Get into a fetal position. Wrap your hands around your neck. Lay on your stomach. Once you do that, 99 percent of the time the grizzly will move on.\u201d  NPS elaborates: \u201cRemain still until the bear leaves the area. Fighting back usually increases the intensity of such attacks. However, if the attack persists, fight back vigorously.\u201d   Fighting back a grizzly bear is the last resort \u2013 \u201cyour Hail Mary pass\u201d as Pratt called it \u2013 when all other options are out. An exception to this rule: If you\u2019re camping in a tent and are attacked, that bear likely sees you as food. NPS and Pratt say this is a time to fight. How do you tell a black bear from a grizzly? First off, know your area and read up on the bears there. In North America, grizzlies have a much more limited range than black bears do. In the Lower 48, they are in Washington, Montana, Idaho and Wyoming. And then in Alaska, too. They also cover large parts of western Canada. Black bears have more territory. They can be found in as many as 40 US states, much of Canada and even parts of northern Mexico, the National Wildlife Federation says. So say you\u2019re in Quebec, the Appalachians, the Ozarks, California or even parts of Florida, that\u2019s going to be a black bear. But if you\u2019re in Yellowstone or Glacier National Park, for instance, that could be a black bear or a grizzly. That\u2019s when it\u2019s crucial to know how to make a quick visual ID. You can\u2019t go by the color of the fur. Black bears can be black, brown, cinnamon, blond, blue-gray or white, according to Bear.org.  One of the best ways to tell the difference, Pratt said, is to look for a hump at the shoulders. Grizzlies have them. Black bears don\u2019t. She also said the face shapes are different. \u201cBlack bear faces look a little more cuddly to me, a little rounder, with a straight nose. A grizzly bear face looks more like a wild predator and has a dished shape.\u201d This NPS webpage has more helpful ways to tell the differences. Fun facts: Eight bear species can be found all over the world \u2013 from tropical Sri Lanka to the frigid reaches of Russia, Norway and Canada. And European websites such as Bear Watching Slovenia give many of the same safety tips as North Americans get. Bear spray and weapons Some people like to carry bear spray and/or a weapon with them when venturing into bear country.  Pratt is an advocate of the former and says be sure to practice using it first before going into the wild. NPS has helpful tips on using spray to ward off bears. She\u2019s more cautious about bringing firearms with you, especially if you\u2019re inexperienced. \u201cTaking a grizzly out with one shot would be tough. You need to be very experienced with a gun to increase your chance of safety.\u201d A Brigham Young University study in 2008 found spray more effective than a firearm. And spray doesn\u2019t permanently harm a bear. Some people like to carry bear bells on their hikes, hoping the noise will ward off the animals. But the park service says that \u201cYelling, clapping and talking are more effective ways of alerting a bear to your presence.\u201d What campers need to know If you\u2019re out camping overnight, you have extra considerations to take. Kyle Patterson, management specialist and public affairs officer at Rocky Mountain National Park, emailed CNN Travel some ways to keep hungry bears away. Patterson advised using a food storage locker if provided in campgrounds and picnic areas. Also, \u201cavoid storing food and coolers in your vehicle. If you must, store food in airtight containers in the trunk or out of sight. Close vehicle windows completely.\u201d Other tips and cautions: \u2022 Don\u2019t store food in tents or pop-up campers in campgrounds or in vehicles at trailheads. \u2022 Don\u2019t leave food, coolers and dirty cookware unattended. Park rangers may confiscate them and cite you. \u2022 Get rid of garbage in bear-resistant dumpsters and trash cans. Human-fed bears usually end up as chronic problems and need to be removed, Patterson said. \u201cA fed bear is a dead bear.\u201d The ball is in our court Pratt emphasized it\u2019s up to humans to be responsible to these creatures. \u201cThe bears are just being bears. We are way more of a threat to them. Bear attacks are so rare. And fatalities are even rarer,\u201d she said. \u201cThe bears\u2019 lives are more at threat than ours in encounters. I want people to have magical, wonderful experiences in the wild. I want people to feel OK about having these encounters.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/article/bear-encounters-prevent-attacks-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_article_chance-encounters-florence-italy-kacie-rose", "text": "Kacie Rose Burns walked into the Florence jazz bar, alone. \u201cI\u2019ll go for one song and suss it out,\u201d she thought, trying to quieten her nerves. Kacie slipped in at the back. The club was dark and busy, a few wall lights and neon signs illuminating people drinking, dancing and chatting. Before she could even take in the musicians on stage, Kacie\u2019s eyes landed on a tall man sitting at the bar. \u201cI walked in and he was there,\u201d Kacie tells CNN Travel today. \u201cWe clocked eyes.\u201d \u201cCiao,\u201d said the stranger, smiling. \u201cCiao,\u201d Kacie said back, before adding apologetically: \u201cThat\u2019s all the Italian I\u2019ve got for you.\u201d It was October 2018. Kacie was a 24-year-old New Yorker on vacation in Florence. It was her first time in Italy and her first time traveling solo. It was an exciting \u2013 and terrifying \u2013 experience. \u201cI was a professional dancer in New York,\u201d explains Kacie. \u201cA very exhausting career \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of toxicity, a lot of rejection, there\u2019s a lot of politics that come into play \u2013 and I was feeling a little stuck, a little unhappy, a little \u2013 just stagnant, if you will.\u201d Kacie spent her days auditioning, traveling for gigs and moonlighting at a clothing store. She needed a break, and she\u2019d long felt a \u201cpull\u201d to Italy and dreamed of an Italian vacation. \u201cI kept saying, \u2018I\u2019ll wait for somebody to go with, I\u2019ll wait, I\u2019ll wait. And then I was waiting for years. And so then one night \u2013 at two in the morning \u2013 I was like, \u2018What am I waiting for? Life is too short.\u2019 So I booked a solo trip to Italy.\u201d Kacie planned to spend the majority of her time in Rome and Venice and just a couple of days in Florence. But in the lead-up to the trip, she got chatting to a customer at the store she worked at. This woman had lived in Florence for five years and sung the Tuscan city\u2019s praises, persuading Kacie to add an extra day to her Florence stint. And that\u2019s how Kacie and the Italian stranger happened to be in the jazz club on the same evening. \u201cI\u2019m really glad that I listened to her,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cThat\u2019s the only reason why we met on the first night that I was in Florence, on that earlier day that I wasn\u2019t originally supposed to be there.\u201d A Florence meeting The man Kacie crossed paths with in the jazz bar was 26-year-old Dario Nencetti, a chef in a Florence hotel who usually worked nights. It just so happened that was the only evening he had off that week. The jazz bar, called Jazz Club Firenze, was one of Dario\u2019s favorite hangouts. He loved the music, the underground ambiance and the fact the bar encouraged punters to sign up for jam sessions. \u201cThat place is, let\u2019s say, unconventional for Florence,\u201d Dario tells CNN Travel. \u201cUsually in Florence, there\u2019s like a table for two or three or four people. In the jazz club, there are big tables, so you can sit with strangers and stuff, which I love.\u201d When Dario realized Kacie didn\u2019t know much Italian beyond \u201cciao,\u201d they switched to English. Dario told Kacie he\u2019d lived in Scotland for a year, and they got talking about travel. Kacie mentioned she was on her first solo trip and Dario said he\u2019d embarked on a similar adventure to Japan earlier that year. \u201cWe bonded from the beginning,\u201d says Dario. \u201cIt was really natural, really easy conversation.\u201d \u201cI remember he made me laugh,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Oh, this guy\u2019s interesting.\u201d So many people ask us, \u2018How did you know?\u2019 And I don\u2019t know how I knew. I was just like, \u2018Oh, this is something different.\u2019\u201d Kacie and Dario stayed at the jazz bar talking into the early hours of the morning. Then they spent as much time as possible together over the next two days. \u201cHe would meet me after his work \u2013 every night he got off at 11. And we would go out and we would just talk,\u201d recalls Kacie. \u201cI instantly fell in love with Florence. It\u2019s a very romantic city - cobblestone streets and medieval buildings. It looks like a painting everywhere you look.\u201d It was a whirlwind two days. One evening they sat by Florence\u2019s Ponte Vecchio bridge and talked until 3 or 4 a.m. It was as though Kacie was in a film \u2013 somewhere between every millennial\u2019s favorite \u201cThe Lizzie McGuire Movie\u201d and classic Florentine romance \u201cA Room with a View.\u201d Then, the two days were up and Kacie had to continue onto the next leg of her trip. It was still like something from a movie \u2013 only it wasn\u2019t obvious this one had a happy ending. \u201cI got on the train and he was standing on the platform. And I remember looking out the train, and I was so sad,\u201d she says. As the train pulled away from the station, Kacie wiped away tears and messaged her best friend back home in New York. \u201cI just met my future husband in Florence,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s the guy I\u2019m gonna marry. I\u2019m never gonna see him again.\u201d Her friend tried to cheer her up. \u201cYou\u2019re going to Rome,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYou\u2019ll meet a gladiator!\u201d But Kacie knew what she had with Dario wasn\u2019t replaceable. \u201cWe never stopped talking. We FaceTimed every single day,\u201d she says. This continued when Kacie was back in the US. And before long, Dario was planning a trip to visit New York. A New York minute On December 8, 2018 Dario arrived in the US. Kacie spent a week introducing Dario to her life in New York. \u201cIt was really cool to see it through his eyes,\u201d she says. \u201cShe showed me the real city,\u201d says Dario. Then the couple flew to Miami for a week\u2019s vacation. For Kacie and Dario, there was never a specific moment where they decided to embark on a relationship. \u201cIt was never a decision to be made,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cIt just went without saying,\u201d agrees Dario. \u201cBut I can\u2019t hide it, long distance was hard.\u201d The two struggled with time zones and their busy jobs that left them with little downtime, but tried to visit each other whenever they could. Cut to September 2019. Dario was back in New York visiting Kacie. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I move here?\u201d he suggested. He\u2019d loved the vibrancy of the city from the get-go and could see himself there. The restaurant scene was incredible. If he could find a job and organize the visa, it seemed like the ideal scenario. Kacie thought so too, so Dario started asking around. He was eventually hired as a chef at an Italian restaurant in Brooklyn. After a couple of months in limbo, his visa was approved. \u201cUp until that point, every time that we had to say goodbye it was borderline traumatic \u2013 we had spent this week together and we knew that this was it for each other,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cSaying goodbye in airports sucked. It would take like a week to recover.\u201d But now the airport goodbyes were consigned to the past. \u201cIt was really exciting,\u201d says Dario. Moving forward together Kacie and Dario spent three months in New York together, giddy with happiness to be in the same country and the same city. Then the pandemic hit. New York City\u2019s performing arts and restaurant industries ground to a halt. Stuck at home, Kacie and Dario found solace and support in one another. As Kacie puts it, she and Dario found \u201cmany silver linings\u201d in this tough time. Dario taught Kacie how to make pasta. They cat-sat. They spent long evenings chatting. But as 2020 rolled on, the couple were aware there was a deadline hanging over them. Dario\u2019s visa was set to run out in December and in the wake of the pandemic, renewal was out of the question. For Kacie and Dario, it seemed like there were only three viable choices: return to long distance, get married or move to Italy. Going back to long distance would mean the return of those airport goodbyes, the last thing either of them wanted. And while Kacie and Dario thought marriage was in their future, they didn\u2019t feel it was right for them at that point. That left moving to Italy. Kacie thought about her career in New York. Performing was off the table and there was no return date in sight. And while her friends were regularly posting on social media about how much they missed dancing, Kacie only felt \u201crelief\u201d that her days were no longer defined by auditioning and uncertainty. \u201cThat was a pretty big wake-up call,\u201d she says. \u201cI had gotten to a point where I needed to take a little step back from performing.\u201d On top of this, Kacie\u2019s New York apartment lease was up. If there was ever a time to relocate to Italy, it was now. \u201cEverything kind of fell into place,\u201d she says. Kacie researched online and found a language academy in Florence offering study visas. She applied, enrolling in Italian lessons. Then, Kacie and Dario packed up their life in New York and got ready to move across the Atlantic. Before stepping on the plane in January 2021, Kacie posted a video to TikTok about meeting Dario and the move to Italy. She\u2019d never posted much on the platform before, but felt inspired to mark this significant life step. When she stepped off the plane and connected to Wi-Fi, her cell phone was blowing up. \u201cIt went viral,\u201d says Kacie. While stuck inside during mandatory two-week quarantine, Kacie continued posting TikTok videos. Her following continued to grow. While her social media presence was getting bigger, for the first few months in Florence, Kacie and Dario\u2019s IRL world remained small. Italy was still in the thrall of Covid, with strict restrictions. But as Kacie studied for her Italian lessons and taught English online and Dario looked for restaurant work, Florence started to slowly reopen. \u201cI remember the first time going to the Duomo. And there was nobody there,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cWhich is crazy, because it\u2019s like the main focus point of Florence. And there\u2019s nobody in the piazza and I remember how bizarre that was.\u201d While that moment was surreal \u2013 even sad \u2013 Kacie and Dario still felt grateful to be at the Florentine landmark together. They\u2019d come a long way, and they were excited for their new life together in Italy. Acclimatizing to Italian life was made easier for Kacie by Dario\u2019s family, who welcomed her wholeheartedly \u2013 even if, in the early days, Kacie struggled with Italian and Dario\u2019s mother didn\u2019t know much English. The two women made communication work by using Google Translate on their cell phones. \u201cThey bonded immediately,\u201d says Dario. Kacie continued to post on social media, and her following ballooned. After about six months, she stopped teaching English online and decided to do social media full time. Dario encouraged this step. \u201cI think it was a really good idea diving into it,\u201d he says today. \u201cIt was the right moment, the right time, and I believed in her from the first moment.\u201d A life together in Italy Almost four years later, Kacie\u2019s expanded her social media presence into a travel company, running group tours around Italy and publishing her own travel guides. Meanwhile, Dario is still passionate about cooking and now works as a fine dining chef at a Florence restaurant. \u201cI really love the life we\u2019ve created here,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cWe live in a beautiful place with great food and he\u2019s got so many awesome things going for him and same with me.\u201d The couple encourage each other in their respective careers and endeavors, but they also savor their downtime. They love living in Florence and exploring Italy together.

There\u2019s so many good things waiting. You just have to trust it,\u201d adds Kacie. \u201cTrust in the process.

{"id": "travel_life-in-bhutan-intl-hnk", "text": "Located between China and India, the world\u2019s two most populous countries, high in the Himalayas, sits Bhutan. Known as the Land of the Thunder Dragon, it\u2019s a Buddhist monarchy of 700,000 residents that has only had regular television broadcasts since 1999. Most foreigners who have heard of Bhutan know two things: the country charges international visitors a $100/day sustainable development fee (aka tourist tax), and that it is the birthplace of the Gross National Happiness Index, a system intended to look after the well-being of citizens and the environment. As this once-hidden kingdom gradually opens up to the world, those things alone make it an intriguing travel destination, alongside historic temples, un-crowded hiking and trekking trails and stunning Himalayan landscapes. But is it really happy? And what does that mean for people living here? Its citizens have a variety of answers. \u201cThe first thing (foreigners) talk about is the gross national happiness that we promote in Bhutan,\u201d says KJ Temphel, founder of the conservation group Green Bhutan. \u201cI think definitely living in Bhutan, for me personally, it\u2019s quite peaceful and I\u2019m very happy to be here.\u201d The World Happiness Report, published annually by Oxford University and the United Nations, puts Nordic nations Finland, Sweden and Denmark at the top of its happiness rankings. The list ranks 143 nations and territories around the world \u2013 but Bhutan isn\u2019t one of them. \u201cI must say that our people were actually happy, but now due to all those modern things and all those technologies coming in, somehow we are disconnected more and then we tend to be more depressed and more sad,\u201d says Tandin Phubz, a creator of the Humans of Thimpu Facebook page, which features photos and profiles of everyday people in the capital in the style of Brandon Staunton\u2019s famous Humans of New York project. \u201cBhutan is a Buddhist country. Spirituality and religion have a very strong effect,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe thing is that with all those gadgets and televisions (people) are somehow distracted from this. They tend to forget to do their morning and evening prayers. They\u2019re on the phones watching TikToks, swiping up and down.\u201d Encountering the world Modernization is a relative term in Bhutan. Locals will proudly tell you that Thimpu is the only world capital without any traffic lights, and shops and restaurants are locally owned and run. Bhutan is the rare world destination that isn\u2019t full of international brands. While there are a few \u2013 outposts of the upscale Le Meridien and Aman hotel chains, for example \u2013 even the capital is mostly bereft of corporate logos. Entrepreneur Chokey Wangmo thinks it\u2019s unlikely that corporations like McDonald\u2019s and Starbucks would ever come to Bhutan \u2013 not because of local policies or customs, but because it wouldn\u2019t be a profitable market for them. \u201cOur population is so (small), we wouldn\u2019t be able to even get the money back for the franchise in the next 10 years,\u201d says Wangmo, who runs several businesses in the southern Bhutanese town of Gelephu, including a coffee shop. \u201cEven if the whole population comes and takes one coffee every day, it will be really hard for them to pay back (the franchise fee).\u201d Wangmo has a front-row seat to how Bhutan is changing. Gelephu, a town of about 10,000 people near the border of India\u2019s Darjeeling state, has been hand-selected as the site for a new \u201cMindfulness City,\u201d a project spearheaded by the country\u2019s king, Gyalpo Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck. It seems impossible to imagine Bhutan without the country\u2019s fifth monarch. Portraits of the king and royal family \u2013 he and Queen Jetsun Pema have three young children \u2013 are in nearly every home and business in Bhutan, displayed the way other nations might hang up their national flags. Photos of the king are omnipresent in the country\u2019s Buddhist temples, placed alongside pictures of lamas and laden with offerings of flowers, fruits and sweets. \u201cIf you look at the houses of the private enterprise, the rich people in Bhutan, their houses are huge and quite decorative,\u201d says Temphel. \u201cBut if you look at our royal family houses, they\u2019re very small and they\u2019re just a simple living and I think humble. And that\u2019s how it matters. How they think about the country and the people, I think. It\u2019s not thinking about themselves, but they\u2019re thinking about the people in the country.\u201d A generation on the brink A growing number of young people are leaving Bhutan to study and work overseas. Phubz, who is in his 20s and currently lives in Perth, Australia pursuing a master\u2019s in communications, is part of Bhutan\u2019s new generation, balancing his love of family and heritage with a desire to see more of the world. \u201cThere\u2019s this Bhutanese quote where it says that, \u2018You do whatever the neighbor does. If he or she goes and milks the cow, you go and milk the cow. If they go and work in the fields, you go and work in the fields.\u2019\u201d He compares this to the current trend of young people leaving to work and study abroad. \u201cParents feel that, \u2018Oh, that neighbor\u2019s son or daughter is going to Australia, I have to send (mine) as well.\u2019\u201d Temphel echoes those sentiments, saying he is worried that Bhutan will have a big population imbalance with more old people than young ones, similar to other Asian countries like Japan and South Korea. \u201cMy worry is after seven years staying in other countries, you are more acquainted with the custom, the habits that you have in different countries, it would be very difficult for them to adjust immediately in Bhutan,\u201d he says. Those Bhutanese who do want to explore the wider world can\u2019t just grab their suitcases and head off. Only three countries have diplomatic embassies in Thimpu, which means that most international relationships have to go via India. Bhutan\u2019s currency, the ngultrum, is pegged to the Indian rupee, and most shops and businesses will accept both. The Henley Passport Index ranks Bhutan\u2019s passport 87th most powerful in the world, with its holders able to access 55 places visa-free \u2013 a list that does not include the United States, Australia or the European Union. Bhutan\u2019s sole international aviation hub, Paro International (PBH), is one of the most beautiful airport descents in the world \u2013 but also one of the most logistically challenging. Located in a valley between two mountains, only smaller planes can come in and out safely. As a result, Paro only offers short hops to nearby Bangkok, Dhaka, Kathmandu and New Delhi. Some of those logistics may become easier, though. In addition to being the home of the new Mindfulness City, Gelephu has been chosen for a new international airport. Its flatter terrain means that there will be space for longer runways \u2013 and, likely, jumbo jets that can go all the way to the Middle East, Europe and beyond. According to government data, the per capita income in Bhutan is 115,787 ngultrum ($1,387) per year. When a flight from Paro to Bangkok begins at $350, international travel is still out of reach for many Bhutanese. Foreigners who want to emigrate to Bhutan, though, don\u2019t have it easy. Only Bhutanese citizens can buy land, and the only way to get Bhutanese citizenship \u2013 even if you\u2019re married to someone from Bhutan \u2013 is by the personal approval of the king. What comes next Wangmo, who spent her student years in India before returning to Bhutan, has been able to see her homeland from both a local and foreign perspective. \u201cThe way we are living is old now,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have to learn and accept new ways.\u201d She gives several examples of workplace culture that she thinks have made it harder for business owners: for example, she couldn\u2019t find a bank in Bhutan that would allow her to fill out account paperwork online instead of going in person. Wangmo says that things like meeting scheduling, out-of-office messages, and online customer service generally don\u2019t exist in Bhutanese offices. Most jobs in Bhutan require traditional dress \u2013 a one-piece garment called a gho paired with knee-high socks for men, and a two-piece jacket and skirt set called a kari for women \u2013 to be worn while working, but some will swap into jeans and T-shirts on weekends. Temphel, of Green Bhutan, says that the Bhutanese mindset is community-centric, where everyone knows each other and looks out for each other. It\u2019s common for neighbors to stop by uninvited and for the whole village to visit a new baby or welcome someone back from the hospital. For Wangmo, this sense of community spirit can sometimes be stifling. She says that she has a hard time telling people that she wants to eat dinner alone or that she doesn\u2019t want guests over every day. And despite Bhutan\u2019s free public health care system, she believes one critical thing is missing \u2013 honesty around mental health. At Coffee Cat Caf\u00e9, which she owns and manages in Gelephu, patrons are encouraged to talk about their mental health with each other. Wangmo says that many people hit a breaking point during the pandemic as forced isolation took them out of the networks they knew so well. \u201cNobody was socializing because of the Covid thing,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd then, once they started talking, they understood how important it was to talk about what they were feeling. And I think that is really when the mental health (conversation) really came into light. Mental health, I think, it\u2019s a very, very personal struggle.\u201d To make it easier for people to open up, Coffee Cat Caf\u00e9 holds events like poetry readings. There are motivational quotes written on the walls and a well-stocked lending library. On their social media accounts, there are campaigns about ending period stigma and encouraging female entrepreneurs. For Wangmo, who is training her restaurant and caf\u00e9 staff to have a more tourist-centric mindset, change hasn\u2019t come quickly enough. \u201cJust because we are wearing different clothes and having all these cars from other countries, it\u2019s not going to get us there,\u201d she says. \u201c(Change is) going to hit us hard. Some people are not happy, some people are scared, they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, if they can survive it. But when we are one faith, we have to do this, there\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t do.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/life-in-bhutan-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_travel_star-wars-hotel-disney-jenny-nicholson-cec", "text": "In 2023, Disney closed a highly-publicized luxury hotel on the Walt Disney World property called \u201cStar Wars: Galactic Starcruiser.\u201d For Disney superfans, it was a time of high drama and schadenfreude as promises about the hotel\u2019s immersive world ran aground on the rocky reality of some guests\u2019 experiences. Now, a year later, a four-hour-long YouTube deep-dive has resurfaced details about the concept and spread the niche piece of Disney lore to millions of viewers. The creator of the video, YouTuber Jenny Nicholson, is known for her commentary on various corners of fan culture. Some of her most popular videos cover shows and movies like \u201cThe Vampire Diaries,\u201d \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d and installments in the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise. None of them are nearly as long as her most recent video, \u201cThe Spectacular Failure of the Star Wars Hotel.\u201d Over the course of 20 video chapters, Nicholson details her 2022 stay at the \u201cStar Wars: Galactic Starcruiser\u201d hotel in Orlando, Florida. The tale is likely familiar to Disney and Star Wars fans, many of whom heard about the high-dollar, high-concept hotel and its closure in 2023. Nicholson says she paid more than $6,000 for a two-night stay in the hotel, which was supposed to resemble a Star Wars-style spaceship called the Halcyon. The big draw of the hotel lay in what Disney marketing called an \u201cimmersive, customizable Star Wars experience\u201d that Nicholson equated to LARPing, or live-action roleplaying. Guests were encouraged to dress up, and through a combination of live experiences with cast members and choices made in a special app, were guided through a three-day-long Star Wars storyline complete with full itinerary and, if played to its full extent, very little downtime. With Disney-esque details like working lightsabers and colorful themed food, the experience was supposed to feel like a \u201clandlocked cruise,\u201d with all of the entertainment happening onboard the ship \u2014 in reality, a large ultra-secure windowless building near Walt Disney World\u2019s Epcot resort area. Nicholson\u2019s experience squared with some more critical reviews of the hotel: Cramped rooms, inconsistent experiences with technology and a general sense of confusion as to the purpose or audience of the venture. (She also mentioned, at length, some of the things she enjoyed, like cast member performances and details in the ship-hotel\u2019s interior.) Little of this is new information. Disney announced the closing of the Galactic Starcruiser in May 2023, and the hotel served its last guests last September. In a press release provided to CNN from that time, Disney said the project \u201cgave us the opportunity to try new things.\u201d \u201cStar Wars: Galactic Starcruiser is one of our most creative projects ever and has been praised by our guests and recognized for setting a new bar for innovation and immersive entertainment,\u201d the statement read. \u201c\u2026 we will take what we\u2019ve learned to create future experiences that can reach more of our guests and fans.\u201d Still, Nicholson\u2019s video netted more than 2 million views in two days, and has already wormed its way into the social media pipeline of memes and references. Some X users marveled at the fact that they willingly watched a double feature-length video about, as one user said, something they \u201cpreviously never gave a s*** about in my life.\u201d Why yesterday\u2019s drama draws today\u2019s audience Longform videos are an increasingly popular form of YouTube entertainment, and it isn\u2019t unusual to see older topics being reexamined in multi-hour \u201cdeep dives.\u201d Nicholson\u2019s video also combines several winning formulas into one: Disney, Star Wars, insider information (Nicholson includes pictures and videos from her time in the hotel) and, of course, failures. \u201cI couldn\u2019t care less about some dumb Star Wars hotel, but give me those 4 hours,\u201d one X user said. Consumer research from Google claims that longform videos are gaining traction among younger viewers and, interestingly, are even more successful when they cover \u201cfan culture\u201d content. \u201cThere is a healthy appetite for more in-depth exploration of topics such as film, TV, and sports,\u201d a 2022 Google consumer insights report reads. \u201cThese allow for fan-centric creators to share thoughts and ideas at length with an increasingly captive audience: 61% of Gen Z would describe themselves as a \u201creally big\u201d or \u201csuper fan\u201d of someone or something.\u201d Both Star Wars and Disney enjoy particularly loyal fandoms with elephant memories and no qualms about engaging the same topics over and over again. Even the tiniest details in a Star Wars movie or a Disney theme park have cult followings, backstories, fan lore and, of course, their own video deep dives. A spotlight on Disney\u2019s future Nicholson\u2019s video, while not exactly breaking news, drops as Disney prepares a new slate of innovations. Earlier this year, Disney announced a massive 10-year, $60 billion expansion program for its parks, cruises and experiences worldwide. That includes a planned 14-acre expansion at the Magic Kingdom in Orlando\u2019s Walt Disney World and an expansion of the original Disneyland in Anaheim. The company recently got final approval from Anaheim\u2019s city council to move forward with DisneylandForward, a nearly $2 billion investment in the Disneyland resort and surrounding areas. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to build on decades of innovation, creativity, and storytelling to bring new, exciting experiences for our guests,\u201d Disneyland Resort President Ken Potrock wrote in a blog post announcing the approval of the project. In April, Disney CEO Bob Iger said expansion plans for Walt Disney World are on track after the settlement of a long legal battle between Disney and the state of Florida. Iger said the decision \u201cwill actually enable us to pursue the kind of significant investment in our Florida parks.\u201d Disney enthusiasts are expecting a trove of new information this August, when the company hosts its annual D23 Expo that focuses on upcoming projects and attractions. While the Galactic Starcruiser hotel has now earned a place in the annals of Disney lore, renewed interest in its failure provides a new lens through which to see Disney Parks\u2019 ambitions and expansions. Will they live up to everyone\u2019s wildest dreams, or be the subject of the next four-hour YouTube deep dive?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/travel/star-wars-hotel-disney-jenny-nicholson-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "2024_07_06_climate_italy-sicily-water-shortage-drought-tourism-intl", "text": "Set atop a hill on the Italian island of Sicily, Agrigento is a heritage tourist\u2019s paradise. Beneath the archaeological structures and relics of its Valley of the Temples lies an ancient maze-like aqueduct system that still captures water today. But the aqueduct, and others built in modern times,\u00a0are running so dry that small hotels and guesthouses in the city and nearby coast are being forced to turn tourists away. They don\u2019t have enough water to guarantee their guests a toilet that flushes or a shower after a day out in the summer heat. Sicily began enforcing water restrictions in February when the region declared a state of emergency amid a relentless drought. Leaky, aging infrastructure has only worsened the shortages, which have hit tourism and agriculture alike, two sectors crucial to Sicily\u2019s economy. Rationing is in place for more than 1 million people across 93 communities. Some are having to reduce water consumption by up to 45%. That means taps run dry according to schedule, and supply is shut off completely overnight in most places. Having enough water to drink is a matter of getting organized during the day. On TripAdvisor and other travel forums, tourists are asking whether it\u2019s worth visiting Sicily\u2019s impacted areas. Hotels are warning clients about potential shortages, and are helping visitors rebook elsewhere on the island where restrictions are less severe or not in effect. At the Le Cinque Novelle bed and breakfast (B&B) in central Agrigento, where restrictions are tight, the owners have put filters on their showers and sinks to save as much water as possible. But their guests often complain. \u201cRightly, people ask us for reassurances before coming, but we don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d Giovanni Lopez, who owns the B&B, told CNN. \u201cThe situation is quickly impacting the entire tourist accommodation sector, which risks serious economic consequences, given that tourism is a sector almost everyone in this part of Sicily relies on.\u201d The Sicilian regional government has asked Rome for subsidies to import water from the mainland, but there\u2019s no concrete plan to help the island as yet. The office of Italy\u2019s tourism minister, Diana Santanch\u00e8, did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment, but in April, she said Sicily should try to spread out its tourism season and avoid focusing solely on summer, when water problems worsen. Summers in Sicily are becoming unbearable for many. Last year, the island endured severe wildfires that forced tourists to evacuate or postpone their visits. Now the drought-triggered water shortages are another worry. Human-caused climate change is heating Europe faster than any other continent, and Sicily sits right at the center of this change. It was here that Europe\u2019s temperature record was smashed in August 2023, when the city of Syracuse hit 48.8 degrees Celsius (119.8 degrees Fahrenheit). Other parts of Italy are also experiencing drought, but only Sicily\u2019s is considered \u201cextreme,\u201d the highest level, according to the Italian National Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA). Less than a quarter of the usual rain fell during the winter across the island, which has left around 20% of underground aquifers in a state of \u201cwater scarcity,\u201d according to ISPRA. In February, the regional government declared a \u201cstate of crisis and water emergency\u201d for irrigation and drinking in Agrigento and four other provinces to last until at least the end of the year. Marco Maccarrone, who owns the Caico Trattoria e Cantina restaurant in Agrigento, says the island is being left to fight for itself. \u201cThe summer season is upon us and we are worried. No one has given us alternative solutions to the water tankers that we are paying for ourselves,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThis risks destroying the only resource we have: tourism.\u201d Maccarrone has lived in Agrigento\u2019s historical center for 20 years and complains that the flow of water is painfully slow. \u201cIn\u00a0half an hour, we can\u2019t fill a single pot,\u201d he said. Hotels are obliged to have a certain amount of water reserves relative to their capacity, said Nicola Farruggio, president of Sicily\u2019s Hotel Federation, which means they also have had to buy water from the mainland. But smaller structures, including family-run hotels and B&Bs, often don\u2019t have a way to store enough to meet the requirements. And if they are located within a residential building, they are subject to the strict rations that apply to condominiums, which means they simply cannot guarantee water to guests. Francesco Picarella, head of Agrigento\u2019s Hotel Federation, who also owns a hotel in the city center, says years of ineffective governance have made things worse. There has been talk of rebuilding the water network since 2011, but little progress has been made, he said. \u201cToday\u2019s problem is the result of a failed water management policy that has been going on for 20 years,\u201d he said. \u201cThe hotels that have their own reserves somehow compensate; the B&Bs in the historic center are in extreme difficulty.\u201d He said that the reservoirs are drying up because of lack of rain but also leaks. In response to CNN\u2019s request for comment, the Sicilian regional government\u2019s office pointed to a study that outlined government plans to drill new wells, build more pipelines and bring aging desalination plants back online. The report also says Sicily has not received enough funds from Rome to carry out its plans. The local federation of B&Bs said that \u201cit should have been a golden year\u201d for Agrigento, which in March last year was named the Italian Capital of Culture for 2025, an accolade that typically draws more tourists. \u201cInstead, word of mouth about the water crisis can ruin the season.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 It was just starting to see an uptick, too. In 2023, visitor numbers increased by 24% compared to the year before, according to Picarella. The island\u2019s tourism ministry said Sicily was expecting to see over 2% more visitors than last year after many postponed their trips because of the wildfires. \u201cPeople see this destination with a lot of interest,\u201d Picarella said. \u201cThis summer we are expecting a greater number of holidaymakers and every day we have to invent a way to move forward.\u201d Running out of time The situation is just as dire for farmers. At an organic farm near Caltanissetta in central Sicily, around 50 kilometers (around 30 miles) northeast of Agrigento, goats are drinking a muddy sludge where a pond once was. Luca Cammarata, who owns the farm, said the drought means grass for grazing is also scarce. He\u2019s never seen Sicily so dry. The lack of water has meant farmers like Cammarata are faced with the devastating choice: cull their herds or let them die of starvation or dehydration. Citrus farmers are also seeing their famous Sicilian oranges shrivelling on their trees from lack of water. The reservoirs used for irrigation around Mount Etna, where the oranges are grown, now hold around half the amount of water than they usually do. If there\u2019s no summer rain, they will drop to around 25%, according to the ANBI Observatory on Water Resources, a government agency. Over-development of urban centers and citrus and wheat farms have reduced the natural wetlands by 20%, worsening the problem, ANBI said. Sicily\u2019s regional president, Renato Schifani, said the island\u2019s losses \u2014 between crops, empty reservoirs and dying livestock \u2014 have already topped \u20ac1 billion. That doesn\u2019t even take into consideration potential loss of tourism dollars because tourists that can\u2019t access water on one part of the island are rebooking in others. But for communities in places like Agrigento, the losses are devastating. It\u2019s just as bleak for Cammarata, who says his whole livelihood \u2014 his 300 goats, 160 head of cattle and dairy operation \u2014\u00a0is at risk. \u201cThe consortium used to guarantee water rotation every five or six days,\u201d he said, referring to a farmers representative group. \u201cNow they can no longer tell us if and when they will open the taps.\u201d The solutions are complicated, even for an island surrounded by water. The three desalination plants that could clean Sicily\u2019s seawater for drinking, sanitation or irrigation have been closed for more than 10 years. Getting them back online, or drilling new wells, will take time. And time is yet another thing the island is running out of.

The plane has the capacity to hold up to 339 passengers, according to Air Europa\u2019s website. One of the passengers, Evangelina Saravia, told the Uruguayan news outlet Teledoce that there had been about 20 minutes of mild turbulence before the plane suddenly dropped 400 meters at a speed of 1,000 kilometers per hour \u2013 catching some passengers, who had ignored the seatbelt warnings, off guard. \u201c(Before the drop) there were people walking, people without belts. There were children sleeping without belts,\u201d Saravia said. \u201cPeople were thrown from the seats and hit the ceiling, that\u2019s why the ceiling broke,\u201d she added. Another passenger, Daniel Monta\u00f1ez, told CNN he and his wife had been sleeping with their seat belts on when the turbulence hit and awoke to see some of their fellow passengers hitting the ceiling of the cabin and falling back down. \u201cPeople who did not have their seat belts unfortunately suffered consequences, injuries,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were people broken, people on the floor, people screaming, people who felt bad, people bleeding \u2026 A rather chaotic image. As you can imagine, the nerves at that point start to play after you come to your senses about what happened, because at that moment you don\u2019t really notice anything, only movements and madness.\u201d Another passenger, Stevan, told Reuters: \u201cThere are passengers with fractures and injuries to their arms, faces, and legs. There are about 30 people injured. It was a pretty horrible feeling; we thought we were going to die there, but thank God it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d The Spanish airline said that another plane was set to depart later on Monday from Madrid and pick up the passengers stranded in Brazil to continue their journey to Uruguay. Air Europa those passengers in need of healthcare were treated in Brazil\u2019s Natal International Airport. A second Air Europe flight picked up some of those diverted to Brazil and took them to Montevideo, Uruguay, their original destination, according to an Air Europa post on X. The passengers arrived in Montevideo on Tuesday morning at 07:20 a.m. local time, according to Air Europa. The airline added in a post on X that they \u201cregret what happened and the inconvenienced caused.\u201d Air Europa also said that some personnel have traveled to Natal to support the passengers that continue to receive medical assistance. The news comes as the latest development in a string of bad publicity for the airplane manufacturer Boeing. While there\u2019s no evidence so far that the injuries on the Air Europa flight had anything to do with a safety malfunction, Boeing has recently faced a series of whistleblowers alleging safety issues at the company. Just last week,\u00a0a whistleblower came forward alleging parts\u00a0of Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliner planes were built in an unsafe manner \u2013 potentially leading to \u201cdevastating consequences.\u201d A previous whistleblower, Sam Salehpour, a Boeing engineer, said he found and reported similar gaps in 787 and 777 aircraft. For nearly two years starting in 2021, the FAA and Boeing\u00a0halted deliveries of the new Dreamliners\u00a0while it looked into the gaps. Boeing said it made changes in its manufacturing process and deliveries ultimately resumed. More than a dozen whistleblowers have come forward against Boeing in recent years, and the number has grown substantially since a\u00a0door plug blew off a 737 Max plane\u00a0in January just after takeoff, leaving a gaping hole in the side the plane. The FAA has opened multiple investigations into Boeing and the US Department of Justice said it\u00a0may file criminal charges\u00a0against the company because of its ongoing quality and safety failures.

{"id": "travel_article_how-to-survive-alligator-attack", "text": "Jeffrey Heim woke up on May 30, 2021, with one thing on his mind: Sharks.  Specifically, shark teeth. They\u2019re his passion and his business. An unsuccessful attempt the day before to find any of them only fueled his obsession to find some on his next outing, he told CNN Travel recently. So on a hot, sunny Sunday in Sarasota County, Florida, the 25-year-old Heim proceeded to the Myakka River on a spot about 45 minutes from the Gulf of Mexico. He had been there numerous times and was comfortable with plunging into its murky waters to find the teeth of extinct megalodons in the riverbed. He put on his wetsuit, mask, fins and snorkel and entered the water from the shore, not far from a restaurant along the riverbank.  Heim slipped beneath the surface. He was under no more than one minute when he felt something. Something bad. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything, didn\u2019t see anything. I just felt like a blunt force object \u2013 like someone \u2026 swinging a baseball bat and just whacking my head. But mostly what I felt was what I thought was a huge boat just slamming into me and just pulling me down.\u201d To his shock, it wasn\u2019t a boat.  He was in the water, alone and face-to-face with an alligator.  Gator attacks: Rare but fascinating   Heim was in a situation many people probably fear but very few actually experience: an attack by an alligator. An estimated 5 million wild American alligators are spread out across 10 states in Southeast and beyond, including parts of North Carolina and even the extreme southeastern tip of Oklahoma. Louisiana has an estimated 2 million wild gators in a state of about 4.65 million people. Florida sports roughly 1.25 million alligators (and more than 1,000 American crocodiles). Georgia has about a quarter of a million. Some of these gators inhabit places where lots of people live and many others vacation, such as lakes and rivers all across Florida and coastal South Carolina. Yet gator attacks aren\u2019t that frequent and deaths even more infrequent (deadly attacks from dogs and horses and other mammals are more common). There were 442 unprovoked bite incidents in Florida from 1948 to 2021, and 26 of these bites resulted in people dying, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conversation Commission. It turns out gators, in natural conditions, simply aren\u2019t that interested in people, according to Kimberly Andrews, a gator and snake expert with a doctorate in ecology from University of Georgia\u2019s Marine Extension and Georgia Sea Grant and who manages its Coastal Ecology Lab.  \u201cWe are not their prey. If you think about it, we\u2019re quite dangerous to attack. We\u2019ve got arms and legs. We can stand upright. We can walk, we can swim. \u2026 We\u2019re not a good animal to pick a fight with.\u201d \u201cUnless they\u2019re confronted, they\u2019re going to stay on their own turf.\u201d Nonetheless, people continue to be fascinated by such possible encounters. Overblown reputation     Andrews wants to dispel the notion of gators as aggressive, ravenous menaces on the move. \u201cThey\u2019re called ambush predators. We also call these \u2018sit-and-wait\u2019 predators,\u201d she said.  They\u2019re large, so it\u2019s \u201cenergetically costly for them to be really active. \u2026 We would be considered an active forager. We go out and find our food.\u201d Not so with gators. \u201cWhen you come down to it, they\u2019re not that maneuverable. Large body. Small legs. And this also plays into why the perception of their danger is exaggerated from the actuality.\u201d  Nonetheless, caution is advised when you\u2019re in gator territory, be that at golf courses, swamps, lakes, rivers and hiking and bike trails and fishing spots along waterways. Best defense: Avoid an attack  Education is key to avoiding a bad encounter, Andrews said. Start with knowing when gators are most active. Courtship season starts as spring warms up; mating extends in early summer; and in Okefenokee Swamp in southeastern Georgia, \u201cwe start to see eggs hatch out starting in September and October. \u2026 And that\u2019s when the females are most protective when they feel someone is threatening their babies,\u201d Andrews said. Your best season is winter: If it\u2019s cold, \u201cthey\u2019re not doing whole lot.\u201d When temperatures start settling into the 80s (27 Celsius), gators become mostly nocturnal. So it\u2019s best to avoid that refreshing night dip in unknown waters when it\u2019s hot. Don\u2019t provoke, don\u2019t feed, don\u2019t panic   Unprovoked attacks are rare, Andrews said. People are usually the provocateurs, not the gators. Gators can be disturbed or confused when folks have been known to try to grab them by their tails or go in for close-up photos of sunning gators Even worse, people will feed them. Then the reptiles start to associate humans with food. That\u2019s when gators can be most dangerous \u2013 when they\u2019ve lost their natural fear or disinterest in people. \u201cThey\u2019re more likely to take the easy way out and get our food than to do the work to fight for it,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cIn areas where we have high rates of tourism but not a lot of education and oversight of how people are interacting with alligators, we see feeding issues.\u201d  If you do have a gator encounter, she suggests staying calm and respecting its territory  \u201cSay you\u2019re kayaking, and you see an alligator, just keep going past it. Give it a wide berth, as much as the space will allow,\u201d Andrews said.  \u201cDon\u2019t take the paddles and slap the water. Sometimes people do that to scare the alligator off,\u201d but you\u2019re actually indicating you\u2019re a direct threat.  \u201cIf for some reason they start to swim toward you \u2026 usually try to go in the other direction and just show you\u2019re not interested. Or paddle right on by and ignore the animal.\u201d Also, never mess with the reptiles\u2019 children. \u201cWe always tell people that those one-foot baby alligators, even though they\u2019re so cute, they\u2019re the most dangerous sized alligator to mess with.\u201d That\u2019s because there\u2019s possibly a nearby mother ready to protect her young. More ways to avoid an attack   Authoritative websites have plenty of good advice to avoid a dangerous encounter. From the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory at the University of Georgia: \u2022 Don\u2019t feed ducks, turtles or other animals that share waters with alligators.  \u2022 Stay about 60 feet (18 meters) or more away from an adult alligator. If an alligator hisses or lunges at you, you are too close. \u2022 If you\u2019re driving, let an alligator cross the road. They move across roadways the most often in spring and summer.  \u2022 Supervise pets and children when you\u2019re in gator territory. \u201cLarge alligators do not recognize the difference between domestic pets and wild food sources,\u201d the SREL says. \u2022 Avoid heavy vegetation in and near the water\u2019s edge.  The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission also advises: \u2022 Never swim outside of posted areas, and swim only during daylight hours. Alligators are most active between dusk and dawn. \u2022 Get rid of fish scraps in garbage cans at boat ramps and fish camps; don\u2019t toss them in the water. Experts also advise people to call local or state authorities if you see alligators roaming around neighbors and other places you wouldn\u2019t expect. Do not try to handle the reptiles yourself. As for Jeffrey Heim, these tips were more than theory. Mission: Survival   Heim was in serious trouble, and he knew it. The gator had already bit him in the skull and on the hand. And it was coming toward him again. The gator \u201cpulled my mask off and pulled my head down towards my stomach. And then I come up, head above water. I no longer have the mask with the GoPro that\u2019s filming. And we\u2019re both looking at each other, and we both sit there for about two or three seconds, and I feel my head.\u201d  He wasn\u2019t sure what he was feeling at the time, but he learned later it was his scalp, partially torn off his skull and flapping in the water. Then \u201cshe lunges at me and I back away calmly \u2026  like I would with my experience with sharks, you don\u2019t want to act like prey. So I just backed away to keep my space.\u201d \u201cAnd then she really aggressively lunged at me \u2026\u201d  What to do if you\u2019re attacked   Heaven forbid you\u2019re that person like Heim who is being attacked by an alligator. Would you know what to do? If the gator is trying to drag you under the water, \u201cyou have to assume at this point you\u2019re fighting for your life, and you\u2019ve got to give it all you\u2019ve got,\u201d Andrews said.  \u201cWe recommend trying to poke them in the eye, hitting them in the top part of the skull or the side of the jaw. Those points are sensitive on alligators just like they are on us,\u201d she said. In a water attack, the danger is more from drowning than the bite, Andrews said. So get to land if possible. \u201cWe\u2019re better on land than they are. They\u2019re better in the water.\u201d But don\u2019t assume all is safe if you\u2019re on land. And the alligator has more in its arsenal that a fearsome set of teeth.  You can be injured if you\u2019re hit by the tail. Gators can also whip around with their skull and use it like a battering ram. Andrews knows first-hand how dangerous that can be.   She was part of a capture team once that had a gator taped up and its mouth secured when it unexpectedly whipped its head around.  \u201cIt actually hit me broad with the side of its head across my shins \u2026 and I blacked out. And I wondered, \u2018Oh my gosh, did I fracture my shin bone?\u2019 I had a lump the size of a tennis ball. It is amazing how muscular and powerful they are,\u201d Andrews recalled. The gator uses its mouth. Use yours. \u201cScream, make as much noise [as you can], not only fight back but make yourself as big and as much a pain in the rear end as you possibly can.\u201d If people are nearby, they should call 911 for help, Andrews said. If a pole is nearby, someone can beat on the gator and give it another target.  \u201cAnother person in an attempt to rescue you should never come in the water after you and the alligator. They can help you most by being on the ground and helping you get to the ground,\u201d Andrews said.  Other ways to fend off an attack   Here are some more survival tips from various wildlife departments and other experts: \u2022 If you can escape on land, run away in a straight line. Experts debunk the advice to zig-zag. Gators can move really fast on land, but only in short bursts and distances before they tire out. \u2022 Try to cause a gag reflex by jamming any objects you can reach into the back of the alligator\u2019s mouth. \u2022 Sometimes a gator will reposition its prey in its mouth. With its jaw back open, that is your chance to escape. \u2022 \u201cAlligators clamp down with powerful jaws, then twist and roll. If an alligator bites your arm, it may help to grab the alligator and roll with it to reduce tearing of the arm,\u201d according to advice from the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources. \u2022 Get immediate medical attention if bitten. Alligator bites often result in serious infection.   All of this is specific to American alligators, Andrews emphasizes.  Other crocodilian species in places such as Africa and Australia can be more aggressive. We\u2019re actually prey-sized for some of these, she said.  But the relatively few crocodiles in southern Florida aren\u2019t known for attacking people. The escape   One of Andrews\u2019 survival tips came in very hand handy as the female gator lunged yet again at Heim. \u201cI really backed away. Got out of that river as quickly as I could. I climbed out of the six-foot bank and stumbled over to the parking lot.\u201d He was about to pass out, but he was able \u201cto yell over to some people over at that restaurant.\u201d Fortunately, they heard his cries for help and were able to assist him with a first aid kit from the restaurant and call 911. While waiting for the paramedics, he wasn\u2019t in pain. But \u201cthe whole time I\u2019m sitting down just super loopy and exhausted. That\u2019s when I thought I was going to die.\u201d He ended up in the ICU in a hospital for two days but was back at work the next week \u201cwith staples in my head.\u201d  Lessons learned   Heim has now had time to reflect on what he did that day and on what others can learn from his attack. \u201cI knew there were gators there. This day, I basically did everything wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cI was aware it was gator mating season, but I went to the river with too much confidence, especially being alone, and free diving, which I had never done in that river before.\u201d \u201cThat cockiness, or confidence, led to the bite, honestly, even though this was an uncharacteristically aggressive alligator apparently. It was still the wrong time of year to go.\u201d  Like other young people who have spent time in the watery wilds in the Southeast, he was lulled into a false sense of security because he had been around gators before with no ill results. \u201cI was casually looking around for gators, but if I had even seen one, I had dove with them before and it hadn\u2019t caused an issue.\u201d \u201cI think the difference was this was near a restaurant, and fed gators are the most aggressive gators. So that\u2019s what the gator professionals believe contributed to this attack, too,\u201d Heim said.   \u201cIf you\u2019re going to dive in a river like that, which I don\u2019t suggest anymore, don\u2019t free dive. You\u2019re going to go up and down like their prey. And you\u2019re going to look much smaller that you actually are.\u201d \u201cWeigh all risks. Anything can happen at anytime to anyone. None of us are invincible. And I think it was the youth in me being a little too confident.\u201d  Heim has been chastened, but not chased off. He continues to search for shark teeth and has ramped up operations for his business, SHRKco. His approach is different now. He\u2019s more cautious. He said he has more and better equipment. He\u2019s even been diving back in the Myakka twice since the attack. However, he now goes with other people, including gator experts.  Andrews said it\u2019s crucial for people to co-exist with alligators because they\u2019re an Indispensable part of the ecology as an apex predator keeping populations of other animals in check. \u201cIn the South, they\u2019re part of our heritage. What a charismatic and iconic feature of our landscapes. It should be: We like our sweet tea. We like our grits. We like our alligators. This is part of who we are.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/article/how-to-survive-alligator-attack/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_us-couple-relocate-ecuador-state-of-emergency", "text": "When Ruth Harrison and Dan Phillips relocated from the US to Ecuador two years ago, their main goal was to enjoy a peaceful retirement. Life had other ideas. Just as the couple \u2013 who have chosen to use pseudonyms for this article \u2013 were settling into a new chapter in a more affordable country that offered interesting new\u00a0travel\u00a0opportunities \u2013 things took an unexpected turn. Ecuador was plunged into a nationwide\u00a0state of emergency\u00a0after one of its most powerful drug lords escaped from prison and an \u201cinternal armed conflict\u201d broke out as security forces took on criminal groups accused of spreading extreme violence. A nightly curfew was imposed and the US State Department cautioned travelers heading there. From the outside, Ecuador now looked far from an ideal place to escape the pressures of life in their former US hometown, Albuquerque. But despite ongoing political tensions, the couple say that they have no regrets about moving there and love their new lives. \u2018People were panicking\u2019 \u201cI would say our opinion hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cI think we\u2019re very happy with our decision.\u201d Shortly before the state of emergency was announced, gunmen armed with explosives had stormed a TV station during a live broadcast. Harrison and Phillips say that, while they were getting trickles of information, they were not aware of the seriousness of the situation until much later. \u201cPeople were kind of panicking and everybody was heading home,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cWe had no idea any of this was happening.\u201d He recounts how a concerned Ecuadorian woman drove over while he was waiting at the bus stop with a friend and told them to head for home. Once Phillips made it to their rented house in Cuenca, a city in southern Ecuador\u2019s Andes mountains, he and Harrison, who had noticed a larger than normal amount of people buying up food at the local store, were able to piece things together. They soon realized that they\u2019d likely be stuck inside for a little while. \u201cWe had enough stuff stocked here for about three days,\u201d says Phillips, adding that there was \u201ckind of a three-day pause,\u201d before \u201ceverybody took a deep breath and went back to life.\u201d However, the couple stress that the situation has had little impact on their lives, largely due to the location of Cuenca, which is well away from the coastal towns, where the \u201cbiggest problems\u201d are. \u201cWe did see a more visible police presence the first few months, but that had returned to normal,\u201d says Harrison, stressing that believes the state of emergency \u201caffected native Ecuadorians, more than expats.\u201d So what prompted this American couple, who were living in Albuquerque up until 2022, to up sticks and move to Ecuador in the first place? Harrison and Phillips explain that they were getting increasingly concerned about how comfortably they\u2019d be able to live in the US as they approached retirement age. Although they were in \u201ca really good spot\u201d financially, Harrison, who previously worked in finance, says that the rising cost of living in the US left her worried that they wouldn\u2019t be able to enjoy the type of retirement that they\u2019d always imagined. \u201cThere weren\u2019t going to be resources for things that we like to do,\u201d she tells CNN Travel. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get compressed in about 10 to 15 years.\u201d Harrison and Phillips, who spent many vacations touring the US Mountain West region by motorcycle, also wanted the opportunity to take more trips together, as well as the budget to live comfortably. Retirement plans \u201cI wanted it (retirement) to be something more than playing video games on my telephone and making trips to the thrift store,\u201d adds Harrison. Realizing that they might have to look outside of the US for a better future, they discussed the possibility of relocating somewhere their money would go further. \u201cWe looked at Italy. We looked at Portugal. We looked at Spain, and Mexico,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cI think we looked at one or two of the Baltic states.\u201d The couple also looked into destinations further afield, such as Colombia, Panama, and of course, Ecuador. In 2017, they\u2019d taken a two-week motorcycle tour in the latter, and were very much taken with the country, finding it to be \u201cvery affordable.\u201d \u201cOne of the things we liked best about Ecuador was all the variety of the country: the glaciers, the beaches, or the Amazon,\u201d says Harrison. The issue of safety was something that they gave a lot of thought before making, comparing crime rates in US cities to those in Ecuador. After some soul searching, Harrison and Phillips decided that Ecuador would be the best place to spend their retirement. \u201cReally, what it came down to was the immigration policies in Ecuador at that time, and now, are much easier to navigate than many other countries,\u201d explains Phillips. Although Ecuador offers various visas for foreigners, they opted for the \u201cProfessional Visa,\u201d which is available to applicants with a university degree (or higher) and is valid for two years. They called in an Ecuadorian immigration facilitator to help them through the process. After researching potential cities to base themselves in, the couple decided on Cuenca, a destination that they hadn\u2019t visited during their trip to Ecuador, but had read much about online. Ecuador calling \u201cExpats in Cuenca are very active on Facebook,\u201d explains Harrison. \u201cWe were able to find Cuenca web pages for apartment rentals, forums for advice on professionals or services. The more we dug, the more information we found.\u201d Once they\u2019d made the decision, the couple began the process of applying for a visa, and put their home on the market. \u201cWe liquidated, resigned, prepared and packed up over the next four months to get here,\u201d says Harrison, explaining that they sold their house, cars, furniture and motorcycles before leaving. In July 2022, the couple flew into the city of Guayaquil with just four suitcases and their two cats. They\u2019ve since adopted two \u201cferal\u201d kittens. Harrison and Phillips initially stayed in an Airbnb, but eventually found a home situated on the first level of a huge house, where they have four bedrooms and three and a half bathrooms. During those first few months, the couple spent much of their time getting to know the area, and doing tourist activities. \u201cWe were so busy from morning to night,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cJust learning the city that we moved to, which is quite good. \u201cWe had to find out how to walk around, when is it safe to go places, when it\u2019s not safe to go places, we had to find the grocery stores, we had to find everything.\u201d The couple were quickly embraced by the local expat community, and made many friends. However, it took them a little longer to get to know locals due to the language barrier. \u201cThat is starting to happen now as our language skills improve,\u201d says Phillips. Phillips, who grew up in a small town in northeastern Montana, says that the experience of living in Cuenca feels similar, and very far removed from life in Albuquerque. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t move as fast (as Albuquerque), it doesn\u2019t bustle as much, people aren\u2019t in as much of a hurry. People smile. People say, \u2018Hello.\u2019 \u201cWhenever you start a conversation with an Ecuadorian, you have to start with the greeting. \u2018Hello, good afternoon. Good morning. Good evening. How are you?\u2019 Every single one.\u201d Harrison admits that she\u2019s had to get used to refraining from being \u201cshort and curt\u201d during day-to-day conversations, which was how she was used to operating in the US, where people are \u201cso busy.\u201d \u201cI have to be careful when I engage in a conversation that I am respective of their habit rather than my tradition,\u201d she explains. \u201cBecause part of being so busy, you don\u2019t want to take up someone\u2019s time.\u201d The couple have also noticed that restaurants don\u2019t \u201cchase you off the table\u201d once you\u2019ve finished your meal while eating out in Cuenca. \u201cYou can sit there pretty much forever,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cThey do seem a little relieved after you get up and leave after three hours though.\u201d No regrets When it comes to safety, the couple say that, despite the tensions in the country, they felt more at risk of \u201crandom violence\u201d while living in America. \u201cIn the US, when I went shopping, I located exits out of stores other than the door I came in,\u201d says Harris. \u201cIn case I had to run, and I have never felt that in Ecuador.\u201d As for the cost of living, they say they get a lot more bang for their buck in Ecuador and are able to live more comfortably. \u201cDepending on your way of life, you can replicate your American life here for about one half to one third of the cost of the same standard in the US,\u201d says Harrison, adding that their rental is nicer than the home they had in the US. \u201cYou can eat out for as little as $2 a meal. I think the highest we\u2019ve seen is $18 a meal.\u201d She goes on to explain that, as utilities are regulated in Ecuador, they spend around $85 a month on water, gas, electricity, internet and cell phone bills. They pay around $470 a month to live in their rented home. The couple aren\u2019t planning to buy a property in Ecuador, explaining that they\u2019ve found house prices in the country to be \u201csimilar to the US.\u201d While Harrison and Phillips have no desire to return to the US, they admit to missing simple things, like the food. And even this has lessened over time. \u201cYou can\u2019t just pop into a Wendy\u2019s here and have a big burger,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t exist here. But the Kentucky Fried Chicken is actually better.\u201d He\u2019s also had to accept that he\u2019ll likely never get to ride to some of the places on his bucket list now that he\u2019s based in Ecuador permanently. \u201cOn the other hand, I have a whole new continent, and a whole new country to explore down here,\u201d he says. While relocating to Ecuador has worked out for them despite the recent crisis, Harris says she\u2019d advise other couples considering making a similar decision to ensure that they\u2019re \u201con the same page.\u201d \u201cI have met some couples where the one person was the big idea person, and the other one just came along because they felt a sense of marital responsibility,\u201d she says. \u201cSo they didn\u2019t feel like it was their choice that they came here. They just followed a spouse.\u201d Although they know of expats who\u2019ve decided to leave Ecuador and return home in recent years, Harrison and Phillips plan to stay put for the foreseeable future, and hope to eventually become permanent residents. However, they\u2019ve openly discussed \u201cwhat we think it would take for us to leave,\u201d says Harrison. She says they would only consider it if they felt that foreigners were being specifically targeted by criminals in Cuenca. \u201cNever seen it. Never heard of it,\u201d she adds. According to the couple, the longer they stay in Ecuador, the less they miss the US, and the more comfortable they are with their choice to leave. \u201cIt\u2019s a decision we made together,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cAnd it was as informed a decision as can be at the time. \u201cI think we\u2019ve adapted to life in Ecuador pretty, pretty readily.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/us-couple-relocate-ecuador-state-of-emergency/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_married-southwest-pilots", "text": "On their first flight together, Joel Atkinson and Shelley Atkinson couldn\u2019t contain their excitement. They enthused to the flight attendants. They posed for photos. They told passengers via a pre-flight announcement. \u201cWe made a big deal about it,\u201d Joel tells CNN Travel. Then, right before take off, Joel and Shelley sat side by side in the flight deck, just the two of them. They\u2019d come full circle, and were about to embark on an exciting new chapter. \u201cIt felt amazing,\u201d Shelley tells CNN Travel. \u201cAs we prepared to take off, I was giddy, euphoric,\u201d says Joel. Joel and Shelley met as twentysomethings flying jets in the US Air Force. They became fast friends, then, over time, fell in love. Today, they\u2019ve been married for 27 years and counting. They\u2019ve brought up two kids together. And now they\u2019re both pilots for Southwest Airlines. They regularly fly together, with Joel as captain and Shelley as first officer. The couple say working together is \u201camazing.\u201d They treat layovers as \u201cdate nights.\u201d They learn from one another\u2019s respective \u201cwisdom and judgment.\u201d And no, they don\u2019t argue mid-flight. \u201cPeople ask us, how does it work, flying together?\u201d says Joel. \u201cWe know a few pilot couples and some of them fly together, some of them don\u2019t. I\u2019ve heard people say, \u2018Oh I could never fly with my wife or my husband.\u2019\u201d For Joel and Shelley, working together is seamless \u2013 a joy that comes easily to them both. \u201cWe\u2019re best friends,\u201d says Shelley. \u201cThere\u2019s just that unspoken bond,\u201d says Joel. Inspired by \u2018Top Gun\u2019 Shelley grew up in Iowa and moved to Colorado \u2013 Joel\u2019s home state \u2013 as a teenager. The two spent their high school years unaware of one another, but they graduated the same year, and both opted to study at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado in the late 1980s. Joel says he was very influenced by the 1985 Tom Cruise movie \u201cTop Gun\u201d \u2013 \u201cwhich made flying jets look like a lot of fun.\u201d For Shelley, who was an athlete, the appeal of the Air Force Academy was less about flying \u2013 which she only really discovered once she was enrolled \u2013 and more an opportunity to play college basketball. \u201cI didn\u2019t attend the Academy to pursue flying, initially. Once I was there I realized it was a great opportunity for a fun and challenging career,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the introduction to flying there made me want to pursue it further.\u201d Joel and Shelley spent four years studying at the Air Force Academy without actually crossing paths, although Joel was vaguely aware of Shelley. \u201cThere\u2019s not that many women at the Air Force Academy, so I kind of knew who she was,\u201d he says. The two finally met a few years later, after they\u2019d both completed pilot training in different states. They got the same first assignment \u2013 flying Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft in Texas. When Shelley arrived in Texas, Joel had been there for a few months. \u201cSo I was there, kind of established, and she came into the office where I was working,\u201d he recalls. \u201cShe came in and turned in the paperwork, and we said, \u2018Hi,\u2019 just exchanged some pleasantries.\u201d Joel was struck by Shelley right away. \u201cShe\u2019s tall. She looks great. She left the room and this other coworker was just looking at me smiling. And I said, \u2018What?\u2019 And he could tell.\u201d Looking back, Joel thinks it was the \u201ceye contact\u201d he had with Shelley that gave his feelings away. Or maybe just \u201cthe look on my face.\u201d \u201cThere was something there,\u201d says Joel, smiling. \u201cBut I just kind of laughed it off. I was like, \u2018Nah, we\u2019re just going to be friends.\u2019\u201d Joel was also a bit intimidated by Shelley \u2013 he was \u201cattracted to her right away,\u201d but didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d ever be interested in him. \u201cShe\u2019s taller than me. And I had never dated anyone taller than me,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s an athlete, she\u2019s a natural leader, and just an impressive person.\u201d But Joel\u2019s warm nature appealed to Shelley. She felt comfortable around him right away. They became close friends. \u201cJoel has a really great sense of humor,\u201d says Shelley. \u201cI love that about him. And he just really has a sensitive heart to people, all people around him, he looks out for people.\u201d \u201cThat really attracted me to him. And also, he used to have a nice dark head of hair. I really liked that too. But he has a very distinguished look now, and he\u2019s just as handsome as ever.\u201d About a year after they first met, Joel and Shelley were deployed abroad, together. That\u2019s when they \u201ckind of started dating,\u201d as Joel puts it. While there wasn\u2019t much opportunity to go on actual dates on active service, they bonded. \u201cConversations, talking about everything, basically,\u201d says Shelley. \u201cWe really got to know each other\u2019s heart that way. And I think it just made it clear that this is what we were supposed to do.\u201d Back home in the US, the two \u201cstarted officially dating.\u201d \u201cWe just kind of knew that this was going to be it,\u201d says Joel. \u201cAnd within a few months, we got married.\u201d Joel and Shelley became instructor Air Force pilots in Mississippi. Then, in the early 2000s, Shelley gave birth to the couple\u2019s kids, two twins, a boy and a girl. Shelley left flying around this time, but she stayed in the military, working for the US Air National Guard. \u201cI wanted to be at home,\u201d says Shelley. The path to pregnancy wasn\u2019t easy for the couple and Joel calls their kids a \u201chuge blessing.\u201d \u201cWe went through in vitro a couple of times,\u201d he says. \u201cIt took a few years for us to actually get pregnant.\u201d The family relocated back to Colorado and Joel transitioned from military flying to commercial flying, becoming a pilot with Southwest Airlines in 2006. Returning to the air Cut to 2021. The pandemic years were tough going for Joel and Shelley, emotionally speaking. While the couple stayed healthy, their kids were in their late teens and struggled with the upheaval. Plus, Covid was impacting the aviation industry, so Joel was flying less. Around this time, Shelley left her job at the National Guard. She and Joel were wholly focused on their family and their kids\u2019 wellbeing. But in time, the pandemic waned and Joel started flying more regularly. Joel and Shelley\u2019s kids graduated high school and started the next phase of their lives. It was a transitional period for the Atkinson family, and in turn, Shelley started considering her future. She found herself dreaming about flying. She hadn\u2019t been behind the controls of a plane in over two decades, but she felt a call to return. She started wondering if, like Joel, she could become a commercial pilot. When Shelley voiced the idea to Joel, he was immediately enthusiastic. \u201cI said, \u2018Come fly with me,\u2019\u201d says Joel, joking \u201ccue the music.\u201d Then, by coincidence, later that day, Joel saw a social media post from his airline, Southwest, about a pilot who\u2019d taken a two decade break to raise a family, then returned to flying. \u201cShe literally had the same story as me,\u201d says Shelley. It felt like a sign. While Joel didn\u2019t know this other pilot directly, he was able to reach out to her via his work network and pass on contact details to Shelley, who subsequently texted the other pilot, asking for guidance and advice. Then, with encouragement from her new friend \u2013 plus Joel\u2019s wholehearted support \u2013 Shelley committed to returning to the skies full time. While Shelley had years of Air Force experience, she hadn\u2019t flown airplanes for 20 years. She had had to hit the books, take additional tests and ensure her qualifications were up to speed. But before long Shelley was hired by SkyWest Airlines, flying regional jets. Then she joined Joel at Southwest in 2023. \u201cIt was crazy. It happened way faster than I thought it would. It\u2019s been amazing,\u201d says Shelley. \u201cIt was meant to be,\u201d says Joel. Flying together Joel and Shelley credit their success as a co-pilot team to their nearly three decades of marriage, as well as years of co-parenting. \u201cRaising two teenagers during Covid, I tell people that was a lot harder than what we\u2019re doing now,\u201d says Joel. Plus, the two met as colleagues \u2013 so they know how to balance commitment to a job with enjoying each other\u2019s company. Still, as a married couple in the military, Joel and Shelley never flew in the same aircraft. \u201cThe military kind of frowns upon it,\u201d says Joel. \u201cIt\u2019s a little morbid, but they don\u2019t want you to both go down in a plane crash.\u201d No such guidelines exist in commercial aviation, and so once Shelley joined Southwest, she and Joel were able to work side by side. Joel\u2019s seniority allows him to regularly bid for flights with Shelley. And the two find Joel\u2019s years of commercial aviation experience pairs well with Shelley\u2019s fresh take. \u201cShe looks to me and relies on me for the experience that I have. But I also know that she is a very sharp person, she just went through a lot of training. So her knowledge is fresh. And she also has that wisdom and judgment,\u201d says Joel. Since the excitement of their first flight, Joel and Shelley tend not to \u201cmake a big deal\u201d about being a husband and wife pilot duo \u2013 unless it\u2019s preempted by their colleagues. \u201cWe wait for them to ask,\u201d says Shelley. As the couple share the same last name, often crew members put two and two together. As Joel\u2019s the more senior of the two, he often runs the pre-flight briefing. Sometimes he\u2019ll end it with a quick, throwaway: \u201cYes, we\u2019re married.\u201d The crew usually \u201cstart laughing,\u201d says Joel. When Joel and Shelley are taking off and landing, they\u2019re focused on the job at hand. \u201cIt\u2019s very technical,\u201d says Joel. \u201cWe\u2019re running checklists.\u201d But when the airplane reaches cruising altitude, \u201cthere\u2019s some downtime\u201d and Joel and Shelley will make the most of it, talking through their thoughts on life, their kids, their future plans and everything else that\u2019s on their mind. \u201cIt\u2019s so great, because all the years that I was flying, and she was at home, anything I wanted to talk to her about when I\u2019m up in the air, it had to wait,\u201d says Joel. \u201cYou\u2019re saving up conversations until you\u2019re home. It\u2019s like now we\u2019re making up for lost time.\u201d Then, when they land, Joel and Shelley make the most of the layovers. Southwest largely flies domestically, so the couple enjoy traveling the length and breadth of the US together. \u201cIt is a great job, because you go see different places and spend time in different cities,\u201d says Joel, but before Shelley joined Southwest, Joel says layovers sometimes felt like \u201cwasted time, because it was just me, and I couldn\u2019t share it with her.\u201d \u201cBut now we\u2019re together when we\u2019re on the road \u2013 it\u2019s so fun. Because every night on the road, it\u2019s a date night together,\u201d he says. Now, instead of counting the days until he\u2019s home, Joel says his \u201chome is right here\u201d because \u201cshe\u2019s with me.\u201d Family connection While Joel and Shelley have flown together countless times since Shelley joined Southwest, they\u2019ve yet to fly with their kids in tow. That\u2019s on the to-do list \u2013 plus, their son is also training to be a pilot, so there\u2019s a chance Shelley and Joel might pilot an aircraft with him in the future. For Shelley, an additional perk of the last couple of years is her adult kids getting to \u201cview her as a pilot for the first time.\u201d Shelley and Joel\u2019s children grew up knowing their parents met flying jets \u2013 but\u00a0while they saw their father regularly piloting airplanes for Southwest, they never saw Shelley flying. Shelley is really happy her children get to see her doing a job she loves. Shelley\u2019s also proud to be a female pilot in an industry that\u2019s still very male-dominated. She hopes to inspire other people, especially mothers who may have taken a break from the workplace to raise a family, by demonstrating that returning to a passion is possible. \u201cI hope it encourages other women that there is this opportunity out there \u2013 you can come back and you can still do it,\u201d she says. Shelley says she\u2019s really loved rediscovering her love of flying. \u201cThe view from 36,000 feet is pretty awesome,\u201d she says. \u201cFlying over parts of the country - I just love looking down and going, \u2018Oh, what town is that?\u2019\u201d Shelley and Joel particularly enjoy flying in and out of San Diego, California, but they also love it when Southwest takes them to New York. Before Christmas, they enjoyed a stopover in New York City and went searching for the settings of their favorite movies, from \u201cElf\u201d to \u201cSerendipity.\u201d \u201cI love traveling, seeing new places,\u201d says Joel, who adds that he\u2019s gone from avoiding working weekends to voluntarily signing up for Saturday and Sunday flight shifts. He and Shelley now spend Saturday nights watching jazz in Portland, going on hikes in Sacramento or drinking cocktails in Palm Springs. Joel\u2019s always loved flying \u2013 especially what he calls \u201cthe art and science\u201d of aviation. He also loves \u201cserving people, getting them to where they need to be,\u201d but he admits flying during the pandemic was hard going. For Joel, having Shelley now by his side at work has \u201cbeen just a complete turnaround.\u201d Now even the ride to work is fun as the couple car share, coffees in hand. Joel and Shelley, who post about their adventures on their Instagram account @luvpilots, are currently planning to pick up a flight together on Valentine\u2019s Day. Joel bought the two of them heart-printed ties especially \u2013 they\u2019re \u201csilly, but fun,\u201d says Joel. The couple enjoy chronicling their travels on social media \u2013 celebrating their marriage, their respective careers and their adventures. \u201cWe feel blessed. We\u2019re thankful for the opportunity,\u201d says Joel. \u201cWe\u2019re thankful to Southwest Airlines for letting us do this together.\u201d \u201cIf you love doing something, why not do it with the person you love?\u201d says Shelley.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/married-southwest-pilots/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_youngest-duo-ride-around-the-world-by-motorbike", "text": "They first traveled long distance by motorcycle just a few years ago, but this couple now hold the title of youngest duo to circumnavigate the globe on a motorbike, two up. Lavi Scholl and Ollie Gamblin, now aged 32 and 34, visited 39 different countries, including Morocco, Argentina, and Mongolia, during their record setting 589-day motorbike trip and even found time to squeeze in a quick wedding. \u201cIt was quite an endeavor to set out and say, \u2018Right, we\u2019re going to do this,\u2019\u201d Gamblin, from the UK, tells CNN Travel. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really know how long it was going to take. We didn\u2019t know whether we\u2019d get to the end.\u201d Record-setting journey The couple, who tied the knot while riding through Las Vegas last year, first met while they were both working on a farm in Australia in 2017 and began traveling together soon after. \u201cI had a campervan at the time,\u201d adds Gamblin, explaining that Scholl had been camping in tents while traveling in her car. \u201cAnd Lavi thought it would be a good upgrade to join me in the camper van.\u201d After departing Australia, Scholl and Gamblin spent around five and a half months hiking around New Zealand. \u201cWe realized that we both have a passion for overland (travel),\u201d says Scholl, from Germany. Keen to take things further, the couple began planning a cycling trip around the world. However, after going on a short test run, they decided that it\u2019d be too \u201cexhausting\u201d and would \u201cprobably take years and years and years.\u201d \u201cSo we decided the best form of travel would be a motorcycle,\u201d says Gamblin, who has had a motorcycle license since he was 17. \u201cAnd that was the first time either of us have traveled overland or anything on a motorcycle.\u201d After a friend made an attempt to become the youngest male to circumnavigate the globe by motorcycle, the pair got in touch with Guinness World Records to see if they could set the record for the youngest pair to circumnavigate the globe by motorcycle (riding pillion). They had to meet certain requirements, which included beginning and starting their trip at the same location, traveling in one direction continuously and traveling through two antipodal points. The couple, known as \u201cLavi and Ollie\u201d were loaned a Suzuki V-Strom 1050XT by UK dealership Motorcycle World, and Gamblin says he fell over while riding out of the parking lot. Unsteady start \u201cI couldn\u2019t handle the weight of the bike on my leg with no gear and Lavi wasn\u2019t even on the bike,\u201d he says. After going on a test ride to the Peak District in central England, the couple marked out a route around the world on Google Maps and got together as much money as they could to fund the trip and purchase all the gear they\u2019d need on the road. \u201cWe\u2019ve never done this before,\u201d explains Gamblin. \u201cSo we had to buy everything from scratch.\u201d Their trip was delayed as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, but the pair were eventually able to set off in April 2022, starting from the Ace Cafe, a popular motorcyclist hangout in northwest London. \u201cNot all international borders were open at the time,\u201d says Gamblin. \u201cBut we figured that, as we were going along, it would sort of open up. And luckily it did.\u201d When planning their route, they looked into countries that did not require a Carnet De Passage, a passport for a car or motorbike, in order to save on costs. \u201cThe countries we chose didn\u2019t need a Carnet De Passage, and we\u2019d already researched all the visas to make sure that we could get those along the way,\u201d adds Gamblin. \u201cOr if we needed them in advance, we knew which ones to get.\u201d In order to keep costs down, they opted to wild camp as much as they could and avoid eating out. \u201cWe always cook our own food,\u201d says Scholl. \u201cThis was a really good way to save some money. And also, we didn\u2019t drink or party.\u201d While the couple had planned to travel eastwards, they were forced to rethink due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, instead heading south and west across France, Spain and then onto Morocco. \u201cIn the first few months we fell over many, many times on dirt roads, gravel,\u201d says Gamblin. \u201cAny difficult terrain, we just fell over.\u201d Scholl, who rode pillion for the duration of the trip, describes those initial months as a \u201csteep, steep learning curve.\u201d While they eventually got into a solid groove, the journey, which saw them travel nearly 47,000 miles (76,000 kilometers,) wasn\u2019t without its difficulties. Once they arrived in Senegal, Scholl and Gamblin shipped the bike, which they nicknamed \u201cBumblebee\u201d to Brazil. But the shipping container was temporarily \u201clost\u201d en route, which delayed them by around seven weeks and had them seriously questioning whether they\u2019d be able to complete the journey. \u201cThat was really, really challenging for me,\u201d Scholl says. \u201cWhen the bike made it to Brazil, (and) we could get it, it was the happiest day of my life, I think.\u201d Once they were reunited with Bumblebee, the pair were able to continue on through South America, traveling through Brazil, Bolivia and Peru. \u201cThe whole continent of South America really left some marks on me,\u201d says Scholl. \u201cEvery country is very unique.\u201d Ride of their lives The couple experienced some \u201cdifficult moments\u201d during this section of the trip, particularly while riding through the Andes Mountains. \u201cThat was quite tough for us, because of the altitude,\u201d says Gamblin, explaining that they both experienced altitude sickness. \u201cWe\u00a0 had to ride through snow storms and a lightning storm.. So we had some tough conditions\u2026 \u201cAnd we were at altitude for more than a month, I think. So there were some really physically tough days, and it took its toll on us.\u201d Scholl and Gamblin rode all the way down to Argentina, before heading back up to Chile, and riding through Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia. From here, they flew their bike into Panama and entered North America, stopping off in Las Vegas for four days to get married \u201cby Elvis.\u201d \u201cWe had been engaged for six years and had always said that if we got to Las Vegas ever on our travels, we would get married there by Elvis,\u201d the couple told CNN via email. \u201cAnd on this trip that\u2019s exactly what we did. Quick four-day stop and then back on the road. Nothing like a honeymoon of riding thousands of miles.\u201d They then headed to Canada, before sending their bike to Seoul, South Korea via air freight. Once they\u2019d collected it, the newlyweds continued on, heading to Vladivostok, Russia by boat and then on to Mongolia. Gamblin found riding through Mongolia particularly challenging, explaining that he broke his rib after falling off the bike. \u201cAlthough it was probably the most difficult (place) to ride in, Mongolia was absolutely spectacular for me,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was like riding in a National Geographic documentary. \u201cThe roads are very challenging. We fell off loads of times\u2026 So it was challenging, but it was really rewarding.\u201d Despite this, the pair say that they very much enjoyed their time in the country, and loved wild camping there. \u201cThere was an amazing local culture with everybody living in gers (circular, domed tent-style dwellings) and herds of wild animals all over the place,\u201d adds Gamblin. \u201cSo it really felt exactly what I imagined Mongolia to be like in my head.\u201d Once they crossed over to Central Asia, the couple were able to re-energize in Kazakhstan and go on to finish the final leg of the trip, which saw them ride back towards Europe and on to the UK. Triumphant finish Gamblin and Scholl were joined by several other riders for the last section of the trip, from the southeastern UK port of Dover to London, including some of those who\u2019d been following their adventure via their YouTube and Instagram accounts. \u201cThere were lots and lots of riders that came,\u201d says Gamblin. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know any of them. But they all came to support us and we have this massive convoy heading from Dover to London.\u201d The group were greeted by a huge celebration when they arrived back in London on November 19 of last year. \u201cIt was very surreal,\u201d admits Gamblin. \u201cBecause we came back to the Ace Cafe, where we started, same place. \u201cAnd we sat at the same table that we started out at before we left on the trip\u2026 You have the same people that have been there at the beginning. So it\u2019s sort of like nothing actually happened.\u201d After submitting all of the proof required by Guinness World Records, the couple, who has since returned Bumblebee to the dealership, were informed that they\u2019d officially set the record for the youngest pair to circumnavigate the world on a motorcycle (riding pillion.) \u201cThey came back to us about two weeks ago, and approved the records,\u201d says Gamblin. \u201cSo it\u2019s official now.\u201d Currently based in the UK, Scholl and Gamblin say that they\u2019re still processing their incredible feat while trying to get used to being in one place at a time. \u201cThe funny thing is, we never had a flat (apartment), or a house or like this sort of situation together (before),\u201d says Scholl, who recently obtained her motorbike license. Both stress that they have no intention of settling down, and are already planning their next adventure. They plan to head off on a UK-based riding trip so that Scholl can improve her motorcycle skills. \u201cLater in the year, we want to go abroad and start a new trip, but on two separate bikes instead of one,\u201d adds Gamblin. Scholl and Gamblin are hugely proud of their achievement and hope that their story will show others that you don\u2019t necessarily need to \u201cdo endless amounts of preparation to do something\u201d as \u201csometimes the best way is to just learn by doing.\u201d \u201cA lot of people find a lot of reasons not to do something,\u201d says Gamblin. \u201cAnd they think they have to be ultimately prepared in every single way\u2026 \u201cWe didn\u2019t have everything worked out on the way, but we did manage to work it out as we went along.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/youngest-duo-ride-around-the-world-by-motorbike/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "travel"}}

Some of the ships, such as Grandeur of the Seas and Harmony of the Seas, have changed the days they make port calls to Cozumel, in Mexico\u2019s Yucatan Peninsula, in an effort to avoid the hurricane\u2019s forecasted path into the area.

Carnival Horizon, originally scheduled to make port at Grand Cayman in the Cayman Islands on July 3, canceled the visit. Its scheduled trip to Cozumel, Mexico, on July 4 was also replaced with a visit to\u00a0Nassau in the Bahamas on July 5. Carnival Liberty was moving its scheduled visit to Cozumel for July 5 to Tuesday as the cruise attempted to avoid the hurricane\u2019s forecasted path into the area. \u201cThe safety of our guests and crew is paramount, and we are continuing to monitor forecasts and factor in guidance from the National Hurricane Center, U.S. Coast Guard and the local port authorities to provide timely updates to our guests as more information becomes available,\u201d said Carnival in a statement.
