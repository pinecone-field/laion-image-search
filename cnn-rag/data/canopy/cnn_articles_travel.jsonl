Those are just some of the words residents of Antarctica use to describe life in the world\u2019s coldest, most mysterious continent. In 1959, 12 countries - including Chile, Japan, Australia and the United States \u2013 signed the Antarctic Treaty, pledging that the seventh continent would only be used \u201cfor peaceful purposes only.\u201d As a result, there are no military bases there, although military planes and ships can bring people and supplies. That means that only a few thousand humans can say that they have lived in Antarctica. And yet, despite bunking with strangers, taking 90-second showers and having zero privacy, there are intrepid travelers who believe all the challenges are worth it. Keri Nelson is one of them. The Minnesota native first went to the White Continent in 2007 to work as a janitor at McMurdo Base, one of the three US outposts there. Now a veteran of 16 Antarctica seasons, she has done stints at all three stations \u2013 in addition to McMurdo, the largest and most active, there are Amundsen-Scott Station at the geographic south pole, and Palmer Station, north of the Antarctic peninsula. \u201cIf I was going to describe it in musical form,\u201d Nelson says, \u201cI would say McMurdo was like gritty, dirty bluegrass and South Pole was like symphony music and Palmer is like really corny, fun pop music.\u201d Summer camp for grownups In the summer months from October to March there can be as many as 1,000 people at McMurdo Base, from scientists to carpenters to dishwashers. Many support staffers have multiple jobs. For example, Evan Townsend, creator of the Antarctica Flag, worked in the kitchen, tended bar and managed the craft room during his stint there. \u201cIt is an entire town,\u201d Keri Nelson says of McMurdo. \u201cYou could go whole seasons and never meet a lot of people there, and it\u2019s just very busy at those stations. It\u2019s just bustle, bustle, bustle all the time.\u201d That\u2019s due to McMurdo\u2019s size as the biggest base, but also due to the rotation of staff, since people will move between other stations or go out on expeditions and research trips throughout the season. While there are some modern amenities \u2013 a room for watching DVDs, a craft room, a gym \u2013 the clubhouse feel of the base offers lots of opportunities for socializing. Nelson has organized fashion shows complete with a runway and played music in the \u201cice bands\u201d that often form during a season. Just three kilometers (two miles) from McMurdo is New Zealand\u2019s Scott Base, and sometimes staffers will make the trip across Ross Island to visit their US counterparts \u2013 joining in on their jam sessions, book club meetings and movie marathons. Some staffers even volunteer to teach classes in yoga, languages or other interests. \u201cThat was my thing that I learned in Antarctica, hip hop dancing and Thai massage,\u201d says Chris Long. Long, who claims to be from \u201cthe most remote living family in New Zealand,\u201d has spent more of his life living off the grid than on it. As a 19-year-old, he took a last-minute gig working in the galley (kitchen) of a Russian ice breaker ship going to Antarctica. He \u201cabsolutely hated\u201d the job, but found his calling along the way. After those disastrous few months, during which the unforgiving waters of the Southern Ocean regularly sent the ship bobbing at 45-degree angles, Long redirected into a job managing logistics for the scientists at Scott Base and now works as support staff for travelers who visit Antarctica by ship. It\u2019s an unconventional life, spending half the year going back and forth across the notoriously chaotic waters of the Drake Passage to South America, but Long says he can\u2019t imagine any other way to be. The other side of the ice Laura Bullesbach doesn\u2019t see anything of her own experience in the stories of fashion shows and book clubs. Her own Antarctic season, which concluded in March 2024, was more serene. She was one of half-a-dozen people staffing the world\u2019s southernmost post office, UK Antarctic Heritage Trust-administered Port Lockroy. \u201cThe island is the size of a football field, so it\u2019s tiny. And you live in a hut together where there are basically two rooms,\u201d she says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any running water and therefore no showers, no proper flushing toilets, and you\u2019re always on top of each other. \u201cWhen I said goodbye at the airport to one of my colleagues, we hadn\u2019t been without each other since the end of October for longer than maybe what it takes to take a shower on a ship. You\u2019re close friends and you\u2019re roommates and you\u2019re colleagues and it\u2019s everything at once.\u201d One common misconception, Bullesbach says, is that life on the remote continent is boring. At Port Lockroy there were daily tasks that kept everybody busy, from basic life admin like taking turns cooking meals to more serious tasks like surveying the water for any plastic that may have washed up and keeping track of the island\u2019s penguin colony. Plus, there\u2019s an educational component. When private, scientific or commercial ships visited Port Lockroy, which is the first scientific base established by the UK in Antarctica, Bullesbach and other team members would go on board to give educational talks, sell souvenirs and pick up mail. But there were perks \u2013 they could often use the onboard showers and sometimes, there were fresh fruits and vegetables they could take back to the island to supplement their supply of tinned and dried foods. Competing for the opportunity to clean up puke Unless you\u2019re a scientist in a very specialized field, your best bet for living in Antarctica is by applying for a support role at one of the stations. Nelson was so gung-ho about going to the White Continent that she went to Denver to attend a McMurdo job fair. After initially being rejected for a job as a dishwasher, she emphasized her training as a registered nurse when applying to be a janitor. One of the interview questions, she says, was \u201cwhat\u2019s the grossest thing you\u2019ve ever cleaned up?\u201d It worked. Since that first stint as a cleaner, Nelson has held a variety of Antarctic jobs, eventually working her way up to a station administrator. The pay was low, but Nelson didn\u2019t care. She wanted the experience of living in Antarctica, and she notes that despite the small paychecks, all meals, room and board, and transport to and from the continent are covered. But landing an Antarctica job isn\u2019t just about having the right CV. Living in close quarters for long periods requires a certain kind of personality. \u201cYou can be an amazing engineer or scientist, but if you can\u2019t live in a small hut or a small station with three other people or maybe on a station with 40 other people for the summer, then you\u2019re no good for the job,\u201d says Long. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter how good you are at the job. Being able to fit in with the team is the most important. You don\u2019t want to make enemies in that kind of environment.\u201d When Bullesbach reached the final round of interviews for the Port Lockroy jobs, she and other candidates went out to a rural area for what she calls a \u201cselection camp.\u201d There, applicants were put into different teams and given assignments like building a tent while blindfolded. The purpose was two-fold: to measure everyone\u2019s practical skills and abilities while also judging how well they could problem-solve and work with others. Another consideration for working \u201con the ice\u201d is what country you\u2019re from and if your country has a base in the Antarctic. Bullesbach is German, but she has the right to work in the UK, which made her eligible for the Port Lockroy job. However, if you\u2019re not a citizen of a country with an Antarctic program there are still some options to spend time in Antarctica, mostly by working in tourism. Once you get the Antarctica bug, Long and Nelson say, it\u2019s pretty hard to get rid of. Getting in the first time is difficult, but since so few people have Antarctica work experience it\u2019s easier to keep returning after multiple seasons. One member of Bullesbach\u2019s team, Clare Ballantyne, had a previous season at Port Lockroy under her belt and served as a mentor to some of the first-timers. \u201cMy expertise is living and working in the most uninhabitable places on Earth,\u201d Long says. \u201c[A resident] might be a scientist, very smart person, knows a whole lot about whatever their area of expertise is, but if you send them down to Antarctica, they\u2019re gonna die tomorrow. So you need someone who is good at looking after and training people to live in that environment.\u201d Planning for every eventuality It\u2019s one of the most common questions for someone about to move to Antarctica: what to pack? For Bullesbach, the answer was \u201cnot much.\u201d She and her colleagues were limited to two bags each. \u201cYou have three jumpers, two pairs of trousers, lots of socks, and then that\u2019s kind of enough,\u201d she says. \u201cThen we got to send a box down with some other personal stuff. Any kind of hygiene products we might need, we got to send down beforehand and then everyone brought one or two board games or stuff to keep us all entertained in the evenings.\u201d Those living at larger and more established camps have the benefit of using what previous residents have left behind. At McMurdo, Nelson says, there was a lending library of books and DVDs, plus gear, clothing and other odds and ends that one might find useful. There were also medical supplies, from basic bandages and gauze to more serious equipment like a defibrillator. Electronics have also been helpful when it comes to packing for the edge of the world. Bullesbach could just bring her fully stocked Kindle instead of physical books to save space and, thanks to solar panels, there was always enough power to keep it charged. There was internet access at Port Lockroy thanks to Starlink, but the team voted as a group not to use their phones during mealtimes. Long says he\u2019s also a minimalist. After some trial and error during his earlier seasons, he now has his packing routine down to a science. \u201cNow I have the gear that I like, so I don\u2019t need to take so many things. I have exactly the pair of salopettes that I like and the warm jacket that I like and the hat that I like. That way, the more you know your gear, the less that you have to think about yourself, the more you can do your job.\u201d Still, there are risks in choosing to live and work in, as Long puts it, the most uninhabitable place on earth. At larger camps like McMurdo, there are trained medical professionals on base who can do a wide variety of procedures. But if someone needs a more serious operation or an urgent treatment, the patient will need to wait for a ship or boat to take them to the closest city \u2013 which could take anywhere from two to 10 days. Long gives several examples of serious injuries that happened in Antarctica. In one case, he says a cruise ship vacationer fell on the ice and broke her arm. Luckily, the on-board doctor was able to put her arm in a cast, and the traveler continued the next two weeks of the trip as planned. In a more serious case, a Russian scientist \u2013 who was also a medical doctor \u2013 realized that his appendix had burst and performed emergency surgery on himself. \u201cHe knew what he was doing and so he knew he was going to die if he didn\u2019t. So he tried and he did it and lived,\u201d says Long. \u201cThat\u2019s what you do when there\u2019s no other option.\u201d Leaving the ice behind Antarctica can have a powerful spell on the people who visit. Both Nelson and Long say they can\u2019t imagine not spending time there, and Bullesbach was already applying for a second expedition the week after returning from her first. Meanwhile, Nelson has launched a podcast, Antarctica Did That For Me, to share her experiences. In a fast-paced globalized world where everyone is on their phones all the time, Antarctica offers a rare opportunity to live a different kind of life. However, climate change is already affecting the seventh continent, and not only by shrinking glaciers. More and more countries who weren\u2019t part of the initial Antarctic Treaty, namely China, are trying to lay claim to part of it as the planet warms. \u201c[Antarctica] is set aside by treaty right now for science and peace and projects that benefit humanity. It\u2019s one of the things I love personally about working in the program. It\u2019s why I\u2019m an Antarctica devotee,\u201d says Nelson. \u201cStuff just keeps being taken from Antarctica. Information, ice, resources like seals and whales and fish,\u201d Klaus Dodds, professor of Geopolitics at the University of London, told CNN in 2021. \u201cAntarctica\u2019s fragility, I think, represents the fragility of the wider world. I think the Antarctic represents, in essence, not just the idealism that the treaty represents, but it also represents the supreme contradictory nature of humanity more generally.\u201d Nelson says that Antarctica gives her a sense of peace that she can\u2019t replicate anywhere else. \u201cWhen I\u2019m there, I can feel exactly as tiny as I am in this universe, no smaller than I am in this universe, but no bigger.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/what-its-really-like-to-live-in-antarctica-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_villa-vie-odyssey-perpetual-cruise", "text": "Under a blazing blue sky in the legendary Harland & Wolff shipyard in Northern Ireland, where the Titanic was once built, the modestly sized Villa Vie Odyssey sits in dry dock, dwarfed by the huge 12-deck Caribbean party boat that looms beside it. But when it sets sail on May 30, after intense refurbishment and cosmetic work, this 31-year-old ship will be one of the hottest new innovations in the cruise industry. It will be one of only two residential cruise ships in operation \u2013 and its world tour will have successfully launched where others have very dramatically failed. Around 300 passengers \u2013 or \u201cresidents\u201d \u2013 will be on board to start the voyage from Belfast which will visit 425 ports in 147 countries across all seven continents, circumnavigating the globe every three-and-a-half years. For this is to be a cruise without end, where passengers can choose between pay-as-you-go and ownership options, spending as little as 35 days or the whole of their natural life on board, with the ship itself being replaced around every 15 years. 1,301 days of summer The relatively small size of the 924-capacity vessel means it\u2019s capable of docking in the heart of destinations, with port stays ranging from a leisurely two to seven days, rather than the typical \u201chit and run\u201d cruise ship approach. These long-term cruise residents do, after all, have all the time in the world. The global itinerary, broken down into 16 \u201csegments\u201d over 1,301 days, has been carefully designed so that it catches the spring-summer seasons in both the northern and summer hemisphere. Residents, if they so choose, may never feel the winter chill again. There\u2019s no commitment to stay on board for the full three and a half years, or to get off when that\u2019s over. Residents can pick and choose between segments as they like. South America is the most popular part and the transatlantic section the least, Villa Vie Residences CEO Mikael Petterson told the dry dock press tour Sunday. Learning from the past Takeup has been high. Of the 295 cabins available at launch, 270 have been sold, with some residents choosing to join later in the voyage. Petterson expects all cabins to be fully booked by the end of the Northern European segment, which ends in August, and more will be opened up during segment two, which is Greenland to Miami. \u201cWe have a significant amount of people that want to come and see the ship themselves before committing, for obvious reasons,\u201d says Petterson. It\u2019s been a long journey to this upcoming launch and this is not the first venture of its kind. In November 2023, Life at Sea Cruises canceled its three-year voyage shortly before departure, having not secured a ship, leaving passengers stranded and pursuing refunds of tens of thousands of dollars. Villa Vie was started by Petterson and other former members of the Life at Sea executive team who quit when the original team split in May 2022. He says they\u2019ve been able to learn from the mistakes of those who\u2019ve gone before. Conservative option The ship now known as Villa Vie Odyssey was constructed in 1993 and \u2013 as the 495-cabin MS Braemar \u2013 was purchased from Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines last year for $13 million. A further $12 million has been spent on the refurb and getting it fully recertified and up to standard. \u201cAt $25 million all in, it\u2019s less than half of what anyone else has been trying,\u201d says Pettersen. \u201cThe ship is much cheaper, the financing is in place, the equity\u2019s in place, the sales are more than twice what Life at Sea had, so we\u2019re just in a completely different position.\u201d The reason the team chose this conservatively sized and priced vessel is \u201cbecause we wanted to make sure we could pull it through,\u201d he says. \u201cThe challenge has all been with the technical and getting her from asleep to awake. We\u2019re largely there. We\u2019re moving onto the hotel and that\u2019s the easy bit,\u201d he laughs. The boat is wearing its age well and it\u2019s not all been an uphill struggle. In 2009, it was enlarged during a refurb, and was renovated again in 2019, with many of the public areas getting a stylish new face. \u201cA lot of these spaces were only in service for four months since they were last revitalized, so we haven\u2019t had to do anything to them,\u201d explains Pettersen. There are plans to keep updating spaces after launch, too \u2013 like a lived-in home rather than an off-the-peg hotel. Under $33,000 a year As the Odyssey, the ship will have eight decks, a wraparound promenade and an enlarged pool \u2013 combining the Braemar\u2019s two, so that passengers can swim laps. And when that feels too energetic, there are two Jacuzzis to lounge in. There will be three restaurants, five bars and lounges, a spa, a fitness center, a library and a medical center. Then there\u2019s the spacious business center with sea views, internet from Starlink and Viasat 3, and an \u201cinteractive culinary center\u201d for those missing the kitchen, as well as for cooking classes. There will also be a golf program with a simulator on board and outings to greens around the world. It\u2019s also surprisingly affordable, as round-the-world cruise experiences go. Over on megayacht The World \u2013 the other residential cruise ship \u2013 prices start at $2 million a year. But on Villa Vie Odyssey, an annual rental works out at less than $32,485, while a three-year stint will set you back $97,455. An inside cabin is $89 per person per day, outside cabins start at $119 per person per day, and balconies at $199. All food and soft drinks are included, plus alcohol at dinner, as well as Wi-Fi and medical visits (but not procedures or medicines). There\u2019ll also be 24/7 room service, weekly housekeeping and bi-weekly laundry service at no extra cost. Endless Horizons Meanwhile, buying entails paying outright for a cabin \u2013 starting at $99,000 for an internal one, $149,000 for an outdoor and $249,000 for a balcony. Owners must then pay monthly fees starting at $1,750 per person, $2,500 per person, or $4,000 per person respectively \u2013 or $21,000, $30,000 or $48,000 per year. Owners can then rent it out to other people themselves (for no charge) or through Villa Vie for a fee. Those buying a cabin will be guaranteed it for 15 years, which is the estimated life of the ship. And then there\u2019s the newly introduced Endless Horizons program, where residents make a one-time payment of \u200b\u200b$299,000 for lifetime access to a cabin, transferring ships when the cruise does. Prices are based on double occupancy. Solo travelers get discounts of 30% for an internal cabin, 20% for an outside one and 10% for a balcony. There are also a lot more solo travelers than one might expect on a typical vacation cruise \u2013 50% of this first takeup are single. In the under-40s range, there are a lot more single male travelers than female, but post-retirement age, there are more women. The average age of traveler is 58 and 80% are from the United States, with Canadians being the next biggest group. Floating community A few of them are on board during the dry dock tour, such as John and Melody Hennessee, flamboyantly coordinated in hats and vests. They\u2019ve made headlines around the world for selling their worldly goods to live on cruise ships for the rest of their lives, and they were there Sunday to plan out their triple-cabin with the team. As these are people\u2019s homes, there are generous customization options afforded to residents, with requests accommodated where possible. There are a small number of large suites available to the ritziest of passengers \u2013 the biggest has a price tag of $900,000. New Zealand couple Mark and Katrina Howard, in hard hats to get their first look at their home for the next three and a half years, have no problem with the downsizing requiring to fit their belongings into a two-person cabin. \u201cWe\u2019ve done motor-homing,\u201d says Katrina. As for cruise ships, \u201cwe met on one in 1994, out of Auckland,\u201d she says, and now \u201cwe\u2019ll be celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary on board\u201d Villa Vie Odyssey. It\u2019s just one of the many celebrations, landmark moments and life-changing events that are set to take place among this floating community of strangers who are about to become close and near-permanent neighbors. Whatever waves or storms lie ahead, the summer-led itinerary ensures the sun will largely be shining.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/villa-vie-odyssey-perpetual-cruise/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_article_best-nude-beaches-world", "text": "2024 is already shaping up to be another banner year for nudity around the world with a nude cruise and nude beach weddings on the horizon. Earlier this year, tour and travel company Bare Necessities announced an 11-day voyage from Miami to the Caribbean in collaboration with Norwegian Cruise Line. It\u2019s due to set sail in February 2025. With stopovers in the Bahamas and Puerto Rico, \u201cThe Big Nude Boat\u201d is billed as a \u201conce in a lifetime experience\u201d with amenities designed to \u201cfit everyone\u2019s style of bare cruising.\u201d  And couples will soon be able to tie the knot sans clothes at Is Benas Beach in Sardinia, which has a naturist-designated area. The news was confirmed in May by Luigi Tedeschi, mayor of San Vero Milis, the closest town to the beach. \u201cNudity has nothing to do with sex. For [naturists], it\u2019s a philosophy of life, and is linked to nature,\u201d Tedeschi said. \u201cIt should be respected \u2013 so why not?\u201d Meanwhile, there are more places than ever to sun, swim or build sandcastles au naturel at clothing-optional beaches around the world.  From rocky coastlines to talcum-powder fine sands and big city bays to secluded shores, there are now hundreds of beaches where it\u2019s perfectly legal (or at least de facto legal) to frolic beside the sea in nothing more than your birthday suit.   \u201cSoft, smooth sand, warm ocean breeze, gentle ocean waves and lots of other naturists makes for a great clothing-optional beach,\u201d says Nicky Hoffman of The Naturist Society, who\u2019s also the managing editor of Nude & Natural magazine and co-author of \u201cThe World\u2019s Best Nude Beaches & Resorts.\u201d  While clothing-optional beach destinations may seem like a modern invention, it\u2019s actually quite an old idea, a product of the otherwise prudish Victorian era. During the 1880s, American poet Walt Whitman extolled the virtues of the \u201cAdamic air bath\u201d \u2013 his nude walkabouts and swims along Timber Creek in New Jersey, writing of \u201cthe free exhilarating ecstasy of nakedness in Nature.\u201d Channeling that same vibe, the naturist movement took off in Europe and North America during the first half of the 20th century, with city parks, camp grounds and eventually beaches established for those who wanted to experience nature nude in their most natural state.  One of the spin-offs of the socially and sexually liberal 1960s was a \u201cfree beach\u201d movement that saw a proliferation of nude beaches around the world. And their popularity continues today, with more and more popping up each year. Here are 24 of the best nude beaches you can visit around the world in 2024:  Playa Naturista Chihuahua, Uruguay  Located about a 30-minute drive from Punta del Este, Uruguay\u2019s best-known nude beach overlooks Portezuelo Bay on the Atlantic coast.  Photogenic dunes and water temperatures that reach 25 Celsius (77 F) and higher even in the Southern Hemisphere winter add to the strand\u2019s allure.     After decades as an unofficial naked getaway, Chihuahua finally achieved legal status in 2000.  Since then, amenities have expanded to include the Hotel El Refugio Nudista Naturista clothing-optional resort. Playa Naturista Chihuahua, Avenida Las Amarras, 20003 Chihuahua, Uruguay   Nida Nude Beach, Lithuania The chilly Baltic Sea may not seem like the most obvious place to skinny dip. But this gorgeous strand on the long, sandy Curonian Spit offers one of Europe\u2019s most picturesque spots to take it all off. With its wildflower-covered dunes (among the highest in Europe) and shoreline forest, the beach was the focus of a 19th-century artists\u2019 colony that attracted many of the leading painters, poets and writers of the time.  Walk far enough south along the strand and you eventually come to a fence that marks the Lithuania-Russia border.  Nida Nude Beach, Nidos-Smiltyn\u0117s pl., Nida, Lithuania Agesta Beach, Sweden Sweden may be home to many beaches where nudity is accepted, but Agesta Beach, located roughly 15 kilometers (9 miles) south of Stockholm, is its only official nude beach.  Based in the southern end of the lake Magelungen, Agesta Beach\u2019s sandy shores are popular with locals as well as visitors looking for an escape from the bustling capital city. Open from May to September, this beach is very well looked after, with picnic tables, BBQ areas, public bathrooms and play areas for children available. Agesta Beach, Huddinge, Sweden Little Palm Beach, Waiheke, New Zealand  Although it\u2019s technically legal to go naked on any beach in personal-liberty-loving New Zealand, the nation\u2019s naturists tend to congregate at well-known clothing-optional spots like Little Palm Beach on Waiheke Island.  Reaching the secluded strand entails a 40-to-60-minute ferry ride from Auckland, a taxi or rideshare to the island\u2019s north shore, and then a short downhill hike.  You can top or tail your beach adventure at Waiheke\u2019s many wineries, restaurants, and art galleries.    Little Palm Beach, Miro Road, Waiheke Island 1081, New Zealand   Nugal Beach, Croatia Flanked by sheer cliffs and shades by pine trees, this remote beach on the mainland opposite Bra\u010d island is reached via a narrow path that seems ready made for goats rather than people seeking an apparel-free escape on the Adriatic.   Be sure to bring a thick towel or even a beach chair \u2014 like many Croatian beaches the surface is pebbles rather than sand.  Nugal is about a half-an-hour walk from the nearest town, although it can also be reached by boat or sea kayak from Makarska or Tu\u010depi. Nugal Beach, 21300 Makarska, Croatia   Moshup Beach, Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts Perched at the island\u2019s western extreme, Moshup is a long curving strand that wraps around a headline crowned by the historic Gay Head Lighthouse (built in 1799).  Located right below the ancient light, the clothing optional portion lies beneath rust-colored sandstone cliffs that were declared a National Natural Monument in 1966.  Moshup is open free of charge to anyone who wants to take their clothes off, as opposed to Lucy Vincent, the island\u2019s private nude beach.    Moshup Beach, 71 Moshup Trail, Aquinnah, MA 02535  Black\u2019s Beach, La Jolla, California Set beneath the high cliffs of Torrey Pines, Blacks has been the Golden State\u2019s favorite place for all-over tans for more than 50 years and was once the only legal nude beach in the entire United States.  Long, wide and blessed with great surf, the beach is reached via the zig-zag Ho Chi Minh Trail from the cliff-top Torrey Pines Gliderport near the University of California, San Diego. Black\u2019s Beach, Torrey Pines Scenic Drive, San Diego, CA 92037 Lady Bay Beach, Sydney, Australia  Although it sometimes seems like just about any beach in Australia is clothing optional, there are a number of official nude beaches here such as Lady Bay. (also known as Lady Jane Beach.)  Perched just inside the South Head of Sydney Harbour, it\u2019s small and narrow, but incredibly secluded for such a big city location.  The rocky ledges around South Head are also used for nude sunbathing.  Lady Bay Beach, Watson\u2019s Bay, Sydney, Australia Buhne 16, Sylt, Germany \u201cGrin and bare it\u201d might well be the motto for nudists on this North Sea island, where the average water temperature in summer is a chilly 17 C (63 F).  Technically all of the beaches on Sylt are clothing optional, but Buhne 16 was the first and is still the foremost location for nude sunbathing along the German shore.   It\u2019s a place where beachgoers can chill in the famous blue and white striped wicker beach chairs or let it all hang out at summer beach parties.  Buhne 16, Listlandstr 133b, 25980 Kampen (Sylt), German Wreck Beach, Vancouver, Canada Billed as one of the world\u2019s longest nude beaches at 7.8 kilometers (4.9 miles) long, Wreck Beach is actually a series of sandy strands, pebble flats and rocky outcrops wrapped around the end of Point Grey.  With the University of British Columbia just across the street, a steady stream of students and teachers have shed their clothes on this beach since the early 1970s, when it first became popular.  Evergreen trees along the shore and snowcapped peaks across the water complement the Canadian ambiance.  Wreck Beach, Vancouver, British Columbia; Canada Red Beach, Crete, Greece This secluded shore on the south side of Crete is a hotspot for nude sunbathing in Greece.  Named after its ocher-colored sand and cliffs, Red Beach (or Kokkini Ammos) is reached via a 20-minute hike from Matala or a very short boat ride from the village waterfront. Pioneered by Euro hippies during the 1960s, the beach offers chair and umbrella rentals and is home to a funky little bar called Yianni\u2019s that\u2019s renowned for its mojitos.  Note: the mysterious rock carvings at the end of the beach are a modern creation and definitely not ancient Minoan relics.    Red Beach, Matala, Crete 702 00, Greece  Callantsoog Beach, Netherlands Callantsoog is the oldest nudist beach in the Netherlands, having been officially recognized as a nudist beach since 1973.  Situated 60 kilometers (37 miles) north of Amsterdam, near the coastal town of Callantsoog, this beautiful stretch of sand enjoys Blue Flag status and is a great place to spot seals.  Its designated nudist section is marked between two poles. Those keen to get even closer to nature can pay a visit to the nearby Zwanenwater, a protected nature reserve and home to the largest natural dune lakes in Europe. Callantsoog Beach, Strandslag Dorpsplein, 1759 Callantsoog, Netherlands Anse de Grande Saline, St. Barts While the Caribbean may be full of wonderful, chilled out beaches, this wild, white sand strand on the rear side of St. Barts is one of the few places on the islands where public nudity is tolerated (although sunbathing naked is technically prohibited in St. Barts.) Anse de Grande Saline (or Saline Beach) is another self-catering beach. Visitors will need to bring along everything they need for a day at the shore, especially sunscreen, as there is no shade to speak of.  L\u2019Esprit, an excellent French restaurant, is within walking distance of Grand Saline and well worth a visit. Just make sure to put your clothes back on before heading over. Anse de Grande Saline, St. Barth\u00e9lemy Platja des Cavallet, Ibiza, Spain Set between the deep blue Mediterranean and multicolored salt pans near Ibiza\u2019s southernmost point, official nudist beach Es Cavallet is separated into various different sections, including a beach club party section, a gay scene and a more secluded, middle section where the clothing-free crowd hang out.  However nude sunbathers aren\u2019t the only beings who frequent this area. Those bright pink things you\u2019ll see pacing in the background aren\u2019t sunburned tourists, but rather flamingos that like to gather in the shallow salines.    Platja des Cavallet, 07818, Balearic Islands, Spain Little Beach, Maui, Hawaii Flanked by ancient lava flows and backed by a volcanic cinder cone, Little Beach would be super-cool even if you couldn\u2019t take your clothes off.  Part of Makena State Park on the island\u2019s southeast coast, it overlooks a national marine sanctuary renowned for its sea turtles, dolphins, whales and tropical fish.  Gnarled trees behind the sand provide a modicum of shade and the cove is well protected for swimming.  Additionally, a drum circle and fire dancers entertain the crowd during Sunday sunsets. Little Beach, Makena State Park, Makena Rd, Kihei, HI 96753, USA Cap d\u2019Agde beach, France Sometimes called the \u201cNaked City,\u201d Cap d\u2019Agde Naturist Village is the world\u2019s largest clothing-optional beach resort, attracting as many as 40,000 guests on any given day during high season. Visitors are free to be naked wherever they want \u2013 restaurants and stores, post offices or banks, sailing their boat or lounging on the long public beach (where nudity is obligatory, even for those not staying at the resort).  Non residents can stay overnight at the naturist hotel, camp ground or rental units.  Cap d\u2019Agde Naturist Village, Rond-Point du Bagnas, 34300 Agde, France Is Benas Beach, Sardinia, Italy Situated along Sardinia\u2019s west coast close to the town of San Vero Milis, Is Benas is known for its remoteness and pristine environment. The idyllic beach has had a partially hidden naturist-designated area for the past two years. Mayor Luigi Tedeschi of nearby San Vero Milis recently confirmed that local authorities had given the go ahead for couples to say their vows there au naturel at Is Benas in the future. \u201cWe have this beach, a place that lends itself brilliantly to naturism,\u201d Tedeschi told CNN. \u201cAnd then we thought, let\u2019s make a beach for weddings. If people want to marry nude, they can.\u201d The beach is right next to the more famous Is Arenas Beach, while the ruins of Tharros, a Roman city dominating a thin peninsula, can also be found nearby. Is Benas Beach, Province of Oristano, Sardinia, Italy Mpenjati Beach, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa  South Africa\u2019s only official nude beach \u2013 and perhaps the only legal clothing-not-obligatory strand on the entire African continent \u2013 is located in the Mpenjati Nature Reserve south of Durban.  Its legal status was achieved in 2014, but this came with a list of prohibitions including no staring, no photography, no suggestive behavior, etc.  Local clergy and others continue to mount protests (legal and otherwise) against the naked designation. Mpenjati Nature Reserve, Palm Beach, Port Edward, South Africa Playa Zipolite, Oaxaca, Mexico  Live your \u201cY Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n\u201d fantasies at the beach where so many of the scenes from the sensuous 2001 Mexican movie starring Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal were shot on location. Pioneered by Mexican and American hippies during the 1960s, the strand stretches about two kilometers with rocky bluffs at either end, and is famed as a clothing-optional beach (although it isn\u2019t legal here.) While the main beach here is backed by budget hotels and cafes, a tiny sliver of sand at the eastern end called Playa del Amor offers far more privacy. Playa Zipolite, San Pedro Pochutla, Oaxaca, Mexico  Metsoke Dragot, Israel Float nude in the warm, ultra-buoyant salty water and smear your entire naked body with soothing, mineral-infused black mud at this rocky beach on the western shore of the Dead Sea.  Perhaps the only place in the Middle East where any kind of public nudity is tolerated, Metsoke Dragot is located about an hour\u2019s drive from Jerusalem and requires a short but rough drive along an unpaved road to reach the shoreline. Primitive camping is aloud along the shore. The only nearby hotel and bar is the cliff top Metzoke Dragot Travelers Village.  Metsoke Dragot, Highway 90, Dead Sea, Israel  Praia Massarandupi\u00f3, Bahia, Brazil   The string bikinis on Copacabana may expose an awful lot of Brazilian flesh, but not nearly as much as this naturist beach along the Bahia coast.  A two-hour drive north of Salvador, the nude beach is about a one-kilometer walk from the parking lot along the shoreline flanked by coconut palms, rolling dunes and very surfable waves.  Praia Massarandupi\u00f3, Bahia, Brazil  Spiaggia di Guvano, Vernazza, Italy  Located on the gorgeous Cinque Terre, this primo Italian nude beach looks like something out of a movie (think \u201cSwept Away \u201d \u2013 the 1974 version directed by Lina Wertm\u00fcller.) Adding to the beach\u2019s mystique is the fact that it can only be reached via an old, abandoned railway tunnel (bring a flashlight) on a path from Corniglia village.  Guvano is totally primitive, with no facilities of any kind, so bear this in mind when planning your visit. The beach is also pebble rather than sand, but the water is clear, clean and gorgeous.   Spiaggia di Guvano, 19018 Vernazza, SP, Italy  Vecaki Beach, Riga, Latvia Edged with pine trees, this Latvian beach is as calming as it is beautiful.  Based close to the capital city of Riga and a relatively short walk from Vecaki train station, it\u2019s known for its shimmering waters, stunning sunsets and of course, its nudist section. The zone, which happens to be the biggest nudist beach area in the country, includes a beach volleyball area that\u2019s a big hit with local residents. Vecaki Beach, Selgas iela 20, Riga 1030, Latvia  Haulover Beach Park, Miami, Florida The most popular public nude beach in the United States, Haulover attracts more than 1.3 million bare bottomed people to its white sands and warm water each year.  The clothing-optional portion, marked at either end by picket fences, offers rental beach chairs and umbrellas, as well as lifeguards.  Given the stellar weather in south Florida, there\u2019s usually someone in the buff on any given day.  But the biggest crowds gather during National Nude Recreation Week in July and whenever Haulover is trying to set a new Guinness World Record for skinny dipping.

{"id": "travel_world-best-tourism-countries-world-economic-forum-2024", "text": "The United States has just won a significant honor \u2013 being named the world\u2019s best country for travel and tourism in 2024 by the World Economic Forum. The rankings are determined by a broad range of criteria, including infrastructure, natural resources, sustainability, labor availability and \u2013 since this is the World Economic Fund we\u2019re talking about \u2013 competitive pricing. Another thing to keep in mind is that the WEF data focuses on tourism \u2013 the business of hotels, airports, attractions, airlines and the like \u2013 and not just what it\u2019s like to be a traveler on the ground. Europe in the lead Six of the top 10 countries on the list are in Europe, with Spain the highest overall. The report calls the continent \u201ca resilient destination with strong intraregional travel flows,\u201d and gives it high marks for train connectivity. There are also points for having strong economies, the good position of the Euro and pound, and the likelihood of Europeans to travel more \u2013 which, in turn, means spending money. It\u2019s no surprise that France scores highly, landing in fourth position overall. The country knows it has the world\u2019s eyes looking its way ahead of the Summer Olympics in Paris this year. Another factor taken into account is the power of many European passports. Every year, the Henley Index ranks the world\u2019s most powerful passports, and their data has been included in the WEF report. For 2024, six countries share the number one ranking \u2013 France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Singapore and Spain. Five of those nations appear in the WEF\u2019s top 10, with Singapore a respectable 13th. The scene in Asia \u201cIn 2024, global tourism growth is expected to be reinforced by the continued satisfaction of pent-up demand and growth in major Asian markets after travel restrictions have been lifted following a delay compared to other regions,\u201d says the report. That certainly feels true in Japan, this year\u2019s third-place country, which has been experiencing a tourism boom since reopening post-pandemic. More than three million foreign tourists per month went to Japan in both March and April 2024, with more expected to visit during the coming summer holidays. Meanwhile, eighth-place China has in recent months made some moves to make it easier for tourists to visit. In March, it dropped visa requirements for residents of several European countries, including Ireland, Switzerland and the Netherlands. It\u2019s also easier than ever for Americans to visit China, as they no longer need to provide an itinerary or proof of hotel bookings to get a travel visa. American beauty While the US is the only North American country in the top 10, neighbor Canada lands just off the chart in 11th position. According to the WEF, the US is a \u201cmature\u201d tourism market, meaning it already has infrastructure in place to welcome visitors, such as air links connecting cities and on-the-ground support like tour guides, rental cars, hotel rooms and maps. The US\u2019 size and scope really help it stand out: from national parks to big cities to great beaches, there\u2019s a big variety of offerings for travelers. However, there\u2019s one potential caveat amid the praise. The report says there\u2019s a likelihood that the US will experience a tourism labor shortage. Like many places around the globe, the pandemic played a big role in people leaving the hospitality business to work elsewhere. Good for tourism versus overtourism It seems impossible to look at a list of the most popular countries for tourists without also acknowledging that in some places too much tourism is the problem. The United States (in first place) and China have the advantage of being large and having lots of room to work with, which helps spread the flow of visitors. Not every destination in the top 10 is so lucky, though. In runner-up Spain, Barcelona voted to keep cruise ships away from the city center, while citizens of the Canary Islands have taken to the streets \u2013 and even threatened a hunger strike \u2013 to protest overtourism. Italy, in ninth position, has also struggled to balance its thriving tourism market with the needs of local communities. Venice began charging a \u201ctourist tax\u201d entry fee last month, and the northern region of Bolzano - South Tyrol has capped its hotel capacity, allowing a new hotel to open only if another has closed.

{"id": "travel_vacation-fling-love-story-chance-encounters", "text": "Guillermo Barrantes relationship with Larry Mock was supposed to begin and end in Palm Springs. It was a \u201ccasual, brief encounter.\u201d A vacation dalliance that only lasted half a day. \u201cIt was just so casual, so easily nothing could have happened from it,\u201d Guillermo tells CNN Travel. \u201cWe could have walked away and just had our lives separate. But of course that didn\u2019t happen, because it wasn\u2019t meant to be that way. It was meant to be the way that it was. That it is.\u201d It all started in summer 2013. Guillermo - then in his early 40s - was on vacation in the California resort city of Palm Springs. He was in a phase of life where, he says, he was prioritizing himself, and wasn\u2019t interested in long term romance. \u201cI thrived in being by myself, in traveling by myself, in having dinner by myself \u2013 I loved all of that so much,\u201d says Guillermo, who lived in Boston, Massachusetts at the time. \u201cI wanted no commitment, I wanted no emotional entanglement of any kind. I wanted to have fun, get to know myself. And it was in that mode that I met Larry, when I wasn\u2019t really looking.\u201d During the vacation in Palm Springs, Guillermo was staying at a friend\u2019s apartment, and while the friend worked during the day, Guillermo passed his time at a \u201crun-down, no-frills\u201d resort a couple of blocks away. \u201cYou could just pay for a day pass, they\u2019d give you a towel, and you could be in the pool and use their bar,\u201d he recalls. One day, as he was walking the palm tree-lined streets to the resort, Guillermo swiped right on a guy on a dating app \u2013 Larry Mock, mid-40s, friendly smile. The two men exchanged a few messages back and forth. Larry said he was also on vacation in Palm Springs, staying in the resort Guillermo kept frequenting. They arranged to meet there for a drink by the pool. Guillermo was looking forward to meeting Larry, expecting \u201csome casual fun.\u201d Then, when Guillermo and Larry met, there was \u201cchemistry\u201d right away. Guillermo calls their connection \u201cmagnetic.\u201d \u201cMy impression of Larry: sexy, handsome and warm,\u201d he recalls. Larry was a Texas-based American Airlines flight attendant who\u2019d booked the vacation to Palm Springs at the last minute. He\u2019d recently broken up with a long-term partner but due to lease and budget reasons the two were still living together \u2013 awkwardly \u2013 in Dallas, Texas. Larry\u2019s workdays were spent traveling the world. But during his downtime, he struggled to relax in the apartment with his ex, and this sentiment motivated the spontaneous vacation. \u201cI needed to get out of town for the weekend, because we were just butting heads badly at that time,\u201d Larry tells CNN Travel today. Larry searched his airline\u2019s database, looking at destinations he could visit using the last minute, standby flight tickets available for flight attendants. \u201cPalm Springs had seats, so I booked my standby flight, got to Palm Springs, checked into this resort. And that\u2019s where Guillermo came into the picture,\u201d says Larry. Larry was instantly attracted to Guillermo. He thought he was \u201cjust the most handsome guy\u201d he\u2019d ever seen. And as they got chatting, and Guillermo kept making Larry laugh, Larry sketched out his first impression to include two more adjectives: \u201cso funny, and so kind.\u201d In passing, as the two flirted over pool-side cocktails, Larry mentioned that he was a flight attendant. Guillermo lit up. In fact, his response was \u201cgiddy,\u201d as Larry recalls it. \u201cHe started asking me tons of questions about planes, and flight attendants, and the routes and all of that kind of stuff.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a huge aviation geek,\u201d explains Guillermo. As a kid growing up in Costa Rica, he\u2019d wanted to be a pilot. Instead, he ended up working as an IT consultant. And while he says he was good at that job, liked it well enough and made good money \u2013 he still dreamed about working in aviation. Meeting a flight attendant was fascinating. \u201cI was immediately drawn to his career,\u201d says Guillermo. Larry found Guillermo\u2019s enthusiasm for aviation charming, and happily answered his questions. Later that evening, Larry and Guillermo said their goodbyes, with no plans to meet again. \u201cI was glad to meet him,\u201d says Larry. \u201cBut I was like, \u2018There\u2019s no way I am going to pursue dating somebody that lived in Boston.\u2019 And I still was dealing with what I was dealing with in Dallas.\u201d \u201cWe just really enjoyed the time that we had together,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cBut we went our separate ways.\u201d Unexpected moments Almost without realizing \u2013 and certainly without intending to \u2013 Guillermo and Larry stayed in touch. \u201cWe kept chatting, we kept texting,\u201d says Guillermo. Then, a few days after meeting Larry, Guillermo got an unexpected phone call from his mother in Costa Rica. He was still in Palm Springs at the time. \u201cShe said, \u2018I don\u2019t want you to freak out, but I just got diagnosed with breast cancer. I don\u2019t want you to change the trip.\u2019\u201d Guillermo tried to protest, but his mother insisted he should enjoy the rest of his vacation. She reassured him that her sisters and Guillermo\u2019s father were taking care of her, and she\u2019d see Guillermo later in the month \u2013 he already had a trip to Costa Rica scheduled for that summer. Not wanting to go against his mother\u2019s wishes, Guillermo stayed put in the desert. He tried to \u201ccompartmentalize\u201d the news, but he was really close to his mom, and it was cataclysmic. Later, back home in Boston, Guillermo found himself sharing his mother\u2019s news with Larry, and confiding in him about his fears and worries. He added that his mother lived in Costa Rica, so he\u2019d likely be flying back and forth for the rest of the year. Larry was supportive, empathetic \u2013 and he told Guillermo that he should use the discounted flights Larry got through work. Guillermo was taken aback \u2013 it was \u201csuch a sweet gesture\u201d from someone who was basically a stranger. But then, somehow, Larry already felt much more than that. \u201cVery early on, he and I had just beautiful interactions, and it revealed the kind of person that he was,\u201d he says. And so, rather than dwindling, Larry and Guillermo\u2019s communication increased as the days rolled on. \u201cWithin just a few weeks, we just knew \u2013 without much discussion, without talking about it \u2013 we just knew that there was a very, very strong connection there,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cWe always had something to talk about,\u201d says Larry. Larry was still hesitant about jumping into something new, following the breakdown of his previous relationship. But the messages back and forth with Guillermo became a highlight of his day. And as time passed, he found himself opening up to Guillermo, confiding in him. \u201cAfter a few months, I was like, \u2018Yes, this is exactly what I was looking for my whole life. Someone that I can be my authentic self with,\u2019\u201d says Larry. Long-distance dating In September 2013, two months after their Palm Springs meeting, Larry arranged to visit Guillermo in Boston. At Logan Airport, Larry came down the escalator and spotted Guillermo\u2019s face in the crowd. He was beaming, and started running towards Larry. Then, Guillermo \u201chugged me so hard,\u201d recalls Larry. He remembers thinking, \u201cOh my god, this is the one.\u201d Then Guillermo and Larry went to Boston\u2019s seaport district together, and found a sundrenched rooftop bar where they sat drinking beers. \u201cWe could see the planes approaching Logan, and it was just a sunny and perfect Boston day,\u201d recalls Guillermo. \u201cI remember that, like a picture, sitting by the edge \u2013 I remember the beer and I remember the planes.\u201d It was \u201cmagical,\u201d says Guillermo, but also slightly \u201csurreal.\u201d The Palm Springs encounter was so brief. He never thought he\u2019d see Larry again. And now here Larry was, sitting opposite him, in Guillermo\u2019s city. From there, Guillermo and Larry started dating cross-country. They took advantage of Larry\u2019s discounted flights. Sometimes Larry traveled to Boston, but usually Guillermo visited Larry in Dallas. Guillermo\u2019s love of flying meant that, for him, the four-hour journey across the country was part of the fun. \u201cI was in heaven,\u201d he says. \u201cJust the fact that I was getting to do something that I have always just loved - which is being on an airplane and going somewhere.\u201d Each Friday, as he packed his bag and headed to the airport, Guillermo would also be struck with \u201cexcitement\u201d at the thought of seeing Larry. And during these weekend visits, Guillermo and Larry grew accustomed to each other\u2019s habits, how they moved through their days, how they liked to spend their time. Guillermo got to know Larry\u2019s friends and got to know Dallas as a city. They spoke about their hopes, dreams, ambitions and families. Guillermo says it was obvious that they were \u201cvery aligned on the important aspects of life: how we view finances, closeness with families, politically and world views and enjoyment of the small things in life.\u201d Larry supported Guillermo as he cared for his mother through her cancer, and celebrated with him when she recovered. \u201cFor us, it was a gradual process of falling in love,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cBut a theme for us in our life together is that everything felt right and natural.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t pinpoint the moment, but we simply knew very deep in our hearts that we found the life partner.\u201d \u201cThat made me so happy,\u201d says Larry. For Guillermo, moving to Dallas two years later, in late 2015, was \u201cjust as the easiest decision.\u201d Larry was thrilled. His Dallas-based friendship group had already welcomed Guillermo into the fold, and his parents were happy for him too. \u201cI introduced Guillermo to everybody,\u201d says Larry. \u201cMy family\u2019s always been very accepting of me.\u201d Guillermo\u2019s family situation was more complicated. He\u2019s always been very close with his parents and siblings, but for the first two decades of his adult life, he didn\u2019t talk to his family about relationships. \u201cMy personal life was not necessarily an open book,\u201d Guillermo says. \u201cLove has never been the question - my parents love me, I love my parents and my sisters, we all get along great. But there was always that invisible barrier, which was: I don\u2019t talk about my personal relationships.\u201d But Guillermo didn\u2019t want to hide Larry from anyone - he felt he owed that to himself, and to Larry. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to edit myself, I wasn\u2019t going to filter. I just knew deep in my heart that it was my chance to be able to truly be myself,\u201d he says. So Guillermo started peppering his phone calls home with mentions of Larry. He uploaded cute photos of the two of them to social media. \u201cI\u2019m fearless,\u201d he told himself. \u201cNothing bad can happen here.\u201d A monumental year Cut to 2018, which was a monumental year for Guillermo and Larry for a couple of reasons. For one, it was the year Guillermo followed in Larry\u2019s footsteps and became a flight attendant. It was a mutual friend who suggested Guillermo should give it a shot, and Larry \u2013 who\u2019d spent years listening to Guillermo wax lyrical about airplanes \u2013 was wholeheartedly encouraging. Guillermo applied to Larry\u2019s airline, American Airlines, but wasn\u2019t accepted. But then he applied to Delta, and was accepted on the spot. While Guillermo and Larry loved the idea of working together, flying with different airlines also \u201cworked out great,\u201d says Guillermo. For one, there were two different sets of airline benefits to enjoy. And working in the air was everything Guillermo hoped it would be and more. \u201cI was doing my dream job, my childhood dream job,\u201d he says. \u201cI still have to pinch myself that actually, I am a flight attendant.\u201d 2018 was also the year Guillermo and Larry got married. Guillermo proposed to Larry on an airplane. The couple were flying back to Dallas after visiting San Francisco, where they\u2019d attended an Adele concert. As they were descending, the Dallas lights glistening out the airplane window, Guillermo suddenly felt the time was right. He turned to Larry and asked him to marry him. Larry smiled, and said yes. \u201cDespite it being impromptu, as an aviation geek, I love that I proposed on a flight,\u201d says Guillermo. The couple started planning their nuptials. Guillermo was excited, but he was unsure what role \u2013 if any \u2013 his family would play on the wedding day. While Guillermo had mentioned Larry to his parents, they still hadn\u2019t met him. This was partly because Guillermo\u2019s family were in Costa Rica, and partly because Guillermo wasn\u2019t sure how that meeting would play out. \u201cThe person that I had the most trouble with was my father \u2013 because he was the one that had the hardest time really accepting me,\u201d says Guillermo. As plans for the wedding started to take shape, Guillermo composed a long email to his father. \u201cI said something to the effect of, \u2018Hey Dad, I know I really haven\u2019t really talked much about any of my personal life. But I met this person, Larry, who is the love of my life. We are going to get married. Come, don\u2019t come, no problem. But I just need to tell you because this is probably one of the most important days and times of my life.\u2019\u201d Guillermo\u2019s father didn\u2019t attend the wedding. \u201cFor those reasons and also because he was towards the end of his life, his mobility was a problem,\u201d Guillermo says. \u201cBut my mom, my sisters, my niece and my nephew came, which was far more than I ever imagined or dreamed. That was such a great moment.\u201d Guillermo introduced his mother and sisters to Larry a couple of days before the wedding. They all gathered at a rooftop bar in Dallas, along with Guillermo and Larry\u2019s close friends. When Guillermo\u2019s mother saw Larry for the first time, she enveloped Larry in her arms. The two hit it off right away. Guillermo was overwhelmed with happiness. \u201cFor me, to see Larry and mom interact \u2013 they just love each other so much,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cAnd my sisters just cannot get enough of him \u2013 I just sit back, and just enjoy.\u201d A magical wedding day Guillermo and Larry\u2019s wedding took place at the Dallas Arboretum, a botanical garden. It was an outdoor wedding, and the couple woke up to the rain pouring and concerned texts from guests worried how the wedding would play out in a downpour. \u201cBut then, sure enough, out came the sun at the right time,\u201d recalls Guillermo. Larry and Guillermo wrote their own vows and read them to each other during the ceremony. Guillermo told Larry that he inspired him to be a better son, sibling, friend and person. \u201cYou want a partner that is going to challenge you to be better,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cI always feel that I want to be a better human being just in general, because he is such a figure in my life and everyone\u2019s life \u2013 he is the center of everybody\u2019s life.\u201d In turn, Larry promised Guillermo their married life would be \u201cexciting, adventurous and full of passion.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m proud to take you as my husband. I promise to fly with you to the ends of the earth,\u201d Larry said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to grow old together and look back at this beautiful moment.\u201d He ended the vows telling Guillermo: \u201cTe amo\u201d \u2013 Spanish for \u201cI love you.\u201d The reception was held at a local winery. During the celebrations, Guillermo and Larry danced to Rihanna\u2019s hit \u201cWe Found Love,\u201d which includes the lyric: \u201cWe found love in a hopeless place.\u201d The couple felt it was fitting \u2013 the resort they met at did seem a bit of a \u201chopeless place.\u201d And they never expected that brief meeting would lead to a lasting love. \u201cWe made sure that song was played, because we did find love in a hopeless place,\u201d says Larry. \u201cAnd I love Rihanna, too,\u201d says Guillermo. At one point, Guillermo and Larry walked through the reception doors holding hands, spontaneously lifting their arms in the air, a \u201cvictorious\u201d pose, as Guillermo put it. \u201cIt was just an electric effect,\u201d he says. The last piece of the puzzle A few years into their marriage, Guillermo and Larry visited Costa Rica together for the first time. Larry was excited to see Guillermo\u2019s home country, and Guillermo was excited to show his husband where he grew up \u2013 and the visit was also an opportunity for Larry to finally meet Guillermo\u2019s father. Guillermo was nervous about how the meeting would play out, but when he arrived at his parents\u2019 house with Larry in tow, Guillermo\u2019s father opened his arms and hugged Larry tightly. \u201cHe said, \u2018Welcome home,\u2019\u201d says Guillermo. It was a cathartic, emotional moment for everyone. \u201cI was so nervous that day, meeting the father-in-law,\u201d says Larry. \u201cAnd when he just said \u2018welcome home,\u2019 and hugged me, every bit of nerves went away. I felt comfortable, I felt welcomed, I felt loved.\u201d Larry says the moment felt like the \u201clast piece\u201d of a puzzle slotting into place. Guillermo was overjoyed. \u201cThat evening, which we got to spend \u2013 me, mom, dad, and Larry \u2013 was just a highlight,\u201d says Guillermo. The family played old records on a turntable. Guillermo and his mother danced in the living room, while Larry and Guillermo\u2019s father sipped cocktails and watched, laughing. \u201cI had to just step back, because you have to look at those moments and just kind of create a little mini movie of them,\u201d says Guillermo. Guillermo\u2019s father has since passed away, which makes Guillermo and Larry all the more grateful for that time together in Costa Rica. In general, a feeling of gratitude defines Guillermo and Larry\u2019s relationship \u2013 gratitude for each other and what they\u2019ve brought to one another\u2019s lives, and gratitude that their paths crossed over ten years ago. On their anniversary, the couple usually return to Palm Springs to celebrate the day they met. \u201cNot only is Palm Springs beautiful with a great vibe, but we love to go back and celebrate our meeting place,\u201d says Larry. \u201cWe weren\u2019t looking, neither one of us \u2013 but it did happen, and it\u2019s definitely for life.\u201d \u201cWhat a gift,\u201d says Guillermo, who says his life today is what he dreamed of \u201cas a little gay boy in Costa Rica, always loving the US, always loving airplanes, always envisioning that I would have a relationship where we are completely free to show our love.\u201d \u201cAnd we do, we do,\u201d he says. \u201cWho could ask for anything more?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/vacation-fling-love-story-chance-encounters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_article_eva-longoria-searching-for-mexico-restaurants", "text": "You\u2019ll no doubt be hungry after watching \u201cEva Longoria: Searching for Mexico.\u201d Every episode is full of mouthwatering regional specialties prepared by chefs all over the country. For those wanting to follow in Eva Longoria\u2019s footsteps, below is a guide to the restaurants and locations she visited. Veracruz: Cradle of Mexican gastronomy Longoria visits the coastal state of Veracuz. Its position along some 400 miles (645 kilometers) of the Caribbean Sea made it a focal point for military conflict \u2013 and the collision of food cultures. \u201cThe people of Veracruz took this treasure trove of ingredients passing in and out of the port and created a whole new cuisine,\u201d Longoria said. \u2022 Longoria met chef Erik Guerrero, who aims to make fishing more sustainable in Veracruz, at Namik restaurant, where they enjoyed ceviche with hot beans and soft shell crab taco. \u2022 Next up, she joined actor and friend Ana de la Reguera for some coffee at historic Caf\u00e9 La Parroquia, Veracruz Port. Tap on the glass three times to ring for milk. \u2022 She headed to the lush inland mountains to meet coffee farming expert Itzel Mendoza at Cafetal Privado en Coetzala to learn how the precious bean is grown. There, they gathered flowers in the fields to be added to chicken stew, a salsa and a palm flower fritter. \u2022 Back in Veracruz Port, she met food historian Nidia Hern\u00e1ndez Medel at Chuchumb\u00e9, a cultural center, to cook some fried yucca, which is traced back to the city\u2019s African slave era.  \u2022 It\u2019s back out of the city to meet with vanilla farmer Norma Gaya, of Gaya Vanilla and Spices, for some vanilla chicken. \u2022 At El Tajin ruins, a Totonac settlement, Longoria met cook Do\u00f1a Marta. She\u2019s the founder of Smoke Women, which keeps ancient Totonac traditions alive. They enjoyed alcamaya (fresh-water shrimp) stew and mushroom empanadas. \u2022  Chef Luis Palmeros, a rising star on the Mexican food scene, introduces Longoria to traditional cook Do\u00f1a Rocio at Cuarto Blanco Market in the inland city of Xalapa (the capital of Veracruz state), for a traditional stuffed jalape\u00f1o. He then takes Longoria to his restaurant, El Cuarto Blanco, for his modern take on the dish. Jalisco: Birthplace of traditions \u2022 At Tortas Ahogadas El Pr\u00edncipe Heredero in Guadalajara, Longoria samples a torta ahogada \u2013 the region\u2019s beloved \u201cdrowned\u201d sandwich. \u2022 In Guadalajara\u2019s Santa Teresita neighborhood, Longoria samples a new preparation of native ingredient chinchayote at Xokol, a restaurant run by chefs \u00d3scar Segundo and Xrysw Ruelas D\u00edaz. \u2022 Longoria attends a charreada, a Mexican rodeo, that takes place at Lienzo Charro Charros De Jalisco. Afterward, she sampled birria, the celebrated goat stew from Jalisco, at the clubhouse. \u2022 Chef Fabian Delgado Padilla treats Longoria to mole with pork belly at his restaurant palReal in Guadlajara\u2019s Colonia Americana neighborhood. \u2022 At Lake Chapala, about 30 miles south of Guadalajara, Longoria meets with members of one of the oldest indigenous groups in Mexico, the Coca people, to talk about their fight to preserve their way of life and history on the lake. They feast on local fish called charales. \u2022 Longoria meets friends Mariana Padilla and Alejandra Pelayo at traditional cantina La Iberia in Guadalajara. Women weren\u2019t allowed in cantinas until the 1980s, Longoria said. \u2022 Then she heads to to the town of Tequila, where Salvador Rosales Trejo shows her how tequila is produced by Tequila Cascahuin using traditional methods. \u2022 Longoria and chef Fabian Delgado Padilla visit Yunaites, his casual restaurant inside a municipal market in Guadalajara, for gorditas topped with pork and mole. Nuevo Le\u00f3n: Where beef is king Say adios to vegetables for a while. Nuevo Le\u00f3n is the land of meat. In this state in northeast Mexico, carne asada is a go-to meal. And it\u2019s the cuisine Longoria grew up with in Texas.  \u2022 In Monterrey, Longoria met up with Alejandro Guti\u00e9rrez, founder of the Mexican Society of Grill Masters, to try the region\u2019s specialty: carne asada (grilled meat). In August, there\u2019s a grill master competition in Santiago, outside of Monterrey. \u2022 Tacos Do\u00f1a Mary La Gritona has been serving breakfast tacos in Monterrey for nearly 20 years. \u201cThese are the best tortillas I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d said Longoria. \u2022 El Jonuco restaurant celebrates the products of Nuevo Le\u00f3n with a focus on seasonal ingredients. They\u2019re known for their cabrito (roasted goat). The restaurant celebrates the little-known history of crypto-Judaism in the region, Longoria said. \u2022 Dona Lupita\u2019s Caf\u00e9, located in the backyard of her home right next to Highway 85 south of Monterrey, is famed for its legendary tamales. \u2022 La Divinita bakery is one of the most successful bakery chains in Monterrey. The founder uses local oranges to make a traditional dessert with Longoria. \u2022 Koli restaurant, run by the three Rivera Rio brothers, is a fine dining restaurant that aims to tell the story of Nuevo Le\u00f3n. Oaxaca: A gastronomic capital Nestled within three vast mountain ranges, Oaxaca is a magnet for food lovers in the know.  A thrill of any visit here is sampling the moles, as well as dishes such as tlayudas (thin Oaxacan \u201cpizzas\u201d), spicy hot chocolate and asado grilled in smoky market stalls. \u201cIt is on another level gastronomically, one of the best places I\u2019ve been to in the world,\u201d Longoria said. \u2022 Mercado de Abastos is a giant market on the edge of Oaxaca City. If you want your chocolate fix, the mercado is still the place to come. This region is known for its moles \u2013 complex sauces featuring many blended ingredients.  \u2022 Casa Oaxaca makes Oaxaca\u2019s famous mole negro drizzled over turkey breast. Longoria called it a magnificently complex and sophisticated sauce. \u2022 At Las Quince Letras, chef Celia Flori\u00e1n made Longoria quesillo \u2013 a stretched Oaxacan cheese --  with crickets and edible flowers. \u2022 In the area of Oaxaca located on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, several muxes, who identify as a third gender and are guardians of Zapotecan cuisine, cooked up stuffed pork with pineapple served alongside pureed potatoes. Longoria called it \u201cthe perfect combination.\u201d \u2022 The farming town of Santa Ana Zegache is the unassuming epicenter of corn. Corn has been worshipped for over 6,000 years and is still the beating heart of Mexican cuisine.  \u2022 In San Baltazar Chichicapam, Longoria visited a palenque (agave farm) run by Do\u00f1a Berta, one of very few female mezcaleras. The farm produces mezcal, the smoky liquor for which this region is famed. \u2022 La Cocina de Humo is a hip restaurant using local ingredients. Chef Thalia Barrios Garc\u00eda is known for her heirloom tomato salad with beet puree and herbal dressing. Longoria said it\u2019s the \u201cperfect dish.\u201d Here\u2019s the recipe.   Yucat\u00e1n: Defined by the Maya Mayan DNA runs through the recipes in Yucat\u00e1n, which has the largest Maya population in Mexico.  The state is located along the Gulf of Mexico and is surrounded by dense forests that isolate it off from the rest of the country. The Maya thrived here for thousands of years before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors in the 1500s. The region\u2019s geography and turbulent history have had a significant impact on the cuisine. \u2022 Ixi\u2019im mixes modern and ancestral techniques and flavors. The restaurant has its own version of the most famous dish from the Yucat\u00e1n, cochinita pibil. Chef Luis Ronz\u00f3n slow-cooks pork underground after it\u2019s marinated in sour orange and spices.  \u2022 Condimentos Enrique is a family-run business that sells recados (spice pastes) in Mercado de Santiago in M\u00e9rida. \u2022 At Huniik, which means \u201cunique spirit\u201d in Maya, chef Roberto Sol\u00eds makes onion tempura with black recado. \u201cI have never had anything like this. This is gorgeous, and it\u2019s delicious,\u201d said Longoria.  \u2022 In his home in Xoc\u00e9n, chef Alberto Kuku prepared one of the oldest dishes, Mayan chicken tamales, for Hanal Pix\u00e1n, a holiday celebrated by the Maya people that means \u201cfood for the souls.\u201d The food honoring the dead \u201ccan easily be carried back to the underworld,\u201d he said. \u2022 Chef Regina Escalante, who runs Merci in M\u00e9rida, showed Longoria how to make grilled seabass with mango, avocado and flor de sal. \u201cI\u2019d have this as my last meal on Earth,\u201d said Longoria. Here\u2019s the recipe. \u2022 At Uxmal, Mayan archaeologist Don Pepe cooked up smoked pork and bean stew. It cooks underground for 12 hours.  \u2022 Kinich in Izamal is famous for its queso relleno. A key ingredient is, surprisingly, Dutch cheese. See how it\u2019s made:  Mexico City: The city of tacos \u201cIt\u2019s crazy, it\u2019s crowded, it\u2019s noisy \u2013 and I love it!\u201d Longoria said as she walked the streets of Mexico City, where she lives part-time with her family. This region was once the capital of the mighty Aztec empire, known as Tenochtitl\u00e1n until the Spanish invaded about 500 years ago and changed its name to Mexico City. Here are the places Eva Longoria visited in the episode: \u2022 Tomasa is a Mexican bakery known for its conchas, a fluffy sweet bread with a crunchy topping.  \u2022 El Huequito in the Historic Center serves up delicious al pastor tacos, which are a staple in Mexico City. \u2022 Tacos Los Alexis is sizzling hot in the taco world. Owner Alexis Ayala uses his five-star culinary training to transform traditional recipes from his childhood into to-die-for gourmet tacos.  \u2022 Contramar in Roma, the bohemian part of town, is one of Longoria\u2019s favorite restaurants. Owner and chef Gabriela C\u00e1mara made her signature dish: pescado a la talla. \u2022 M\u00e1ximo Bistrot, a gourmet restaurant that marries French and Mexican cuisine, is run by chef Eduardo \u201cLalo\u201d Garc\u00eda. For Longoria, he made a roasted beet salad with rocket and wilted purslane. Best known as a weed, purslane is nonetheless edible and very nutritious. \u2022 Mercado de Jamaica is one of hundreds of markets in the city. At the street food stalls, Longoria tried green chorizo tacos and tlacoyos, thick oval-shaped tortillas typically stuffed with beans or cheese. \u2022 Casa Tochan refugee shelter is the first shelter for immigrants in Mexico City. The residents cook dishes from their homeland to share with their housemates.  \u2022 El Moro is an institution famous for its churros and chocolate. \u2022 Hiyoko restaurant in Little Tokyo cooks up a Mexican-Japanese fusion. Chef and restaurateur Edo L\u00f3pez whipped up tapioca tostadas, chicken skewers with ants and duck donburi.

{"id": "travel_vietnam-vintage-steam-trains-intl-hnk", "text": "Train enthusiasts and history buffs alike will soon have a new Southeast Asian destination to visit, as Vietnam prepares to unveil a revamped pair of vintage steam locomotives from the 1960s. The two Revolution Express locomotives are the last working steam trains in Vietnam, dating from when the country was still a French colony, according to hospitality brand Wafaifo Optimisers, which is managing the project. In recent years, the trains have been slowly restored to working condition using original parts, and crafted by the last remaining steam engineers working for the national railway system. Now, the trains are nearly ready to take on tourists and visitors \u2013 with the first trips expected to come late 2024 or early 2025, Wafaifo Optimisers said in a news release. Tickets aren\u2019t on sale yet, and there are no details on pricing \u2013 but booking information will come in the next few months, it said. The trains will travel between the central city of Da Nang, known for its beach resorts on the coast, and the former royal capital Hue, famous for its many palaces and elaborate royal tombs, Wafaifo said. Each train will have two retro-styled carriages for passenger seating, a kitchen car and a baggage carriage. Renderings of the interiors show luxurious furnishings that call back to the trains\u2019 colonial French past with mahogany tables and chairs, gold accents and decorative tiling. Large windows on all sides will allow sweeping views of the passing landscape, as the train winds past the Hai Van coastal mountain range \u2013\u2013 famous\u00a0for its rolling green hills overlooking the vast sea \u2013\u00a0and the village of Lang Co, known for its fishing community and seafood. It\u2019s not just the decor that hearkens back to Vietnam\u2019s past; there will even be staff dressed in \u201cperiod costume,\u201d and a brass band in army regalia to greet disembarking guests, according to the news release. Each train station along the route will be fitted with an appropriately themed restaurant, including one in Hue with an imperial theme to match its royal history, and an independence-themed joint in Lang Co. \u201cWe are proud to bring these old dames of rail back to life and to showcase important periods in Vietnamese history from imperial through colonial rule and finally the struggle to independence,\u201d said Michael Gebbie, the chairman of Indochina Rail Tourist Service. Vietnam declared its independence from France on September 2, 1945 \u2013 a claim that neither France nor the United States recognized. The US proceeded to aid France with military equipment to fight the Vietnamese rebels. By 1954, Vietnam signed the Geneva Accords \u2013 splitting the country into two halves, the Communist-led north and US-supported south, and kicking off the bloody Vietnam War, which would last nearly two decades. The war finally ended in 1975 with the fall of Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City), with more than 1.3 million military deaths for all countries involved and 1 million total civilian deaths. Today, a number of tourism sites commemorate Vietnam\u2019s past, ranging from war memorials to ancient citadels that have been designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites \u2013 including Hue \u2013 preserving the country\u2019s bygone emperors.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/vietnam-vintage-steam-trains-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_hadrians-wall-women-history-vindolanda", "text": "A party invitation. A broken flipflop. A wig. Letters of complaint about road conditions, and an urgent request for more beer. It sounds like the aftermath of a successful spring break, but these items are nearly 2,000 years old. They\u2019re just some of the finds from Hadrian\u2019s Wall \u2013 the 73-mile stone wall built as the northwestern boundary of the Roman Empire, sealing off Britannia (modern-day England and Wales) from Caledonia (essentially today\u2019s Scotland). While most of us think of Pompeii and Herculaneum if we\u2019re thinking of everyday objects preserved from ancient Rome, this outpost in the wild north of the empire is home to some of the most extraordinary finds. \u201cIt\u2019s a very dramatic stamp on the countryside \u2013 there\u2019s nothing more redolent of saying you\u2019re entering the Roman empire than seeing that structure,\u201d says Richard Abdy, lead curator of the British Museum\u2019s current exhibition, Legion, which spotlights the everyday life of Roman soldiers, showcasing many finds from Hadrian\u2019s Wall in the process. A tenth of the Roman army was based in Britain, and that makes the wall a great source of military material, he says. But it\u2019s not all about the soldiers, as excavations are showing. A multicultural melting pot Hadrian, who ordered the wall to be built in 122CE after a visit to Britannia, had a different vision of empire than his predecessors, says Frances McIntosh, curator for English Heritage\u2019s 34 sites along Hadrian\u2019s Wall. \u201cAll the emperors before him were about expanding the empire, but Hadrian was known as the consolidator,\u201d she says. He relinquished some of the territory acquired by his predecessor Trajan, and \u201cdecided to set the borders\u201d \u2013 literally, in some cases, with wooden poles at sites in Germany, or with stone in Britannia. Where those poles rotted thousands of years ago, the wall is still standing: \u201cA great visual reminder\u201d of the Roman empire, says McIntosh. It\u2019s not just a wall. There\u2019s a castle every mile along, and turrets at every third-of-a-mile point, with ditches and banks both north and south. \u201cYou can imagine the kind of impact that would have had, not just on the landscape but on the people living in the area,\u201d says McIntosh. And thanks to the finds from the wall, we know a surprising amount about those people. Although historians have long thought of army outposts as remote, male-dominant places, the excavations along the wall show that\u2019s not the case. Not only were soldiers accompanied by their families, but civilians would settle around the settlements to do business. \u201c You can almost see Housesteads as a garrison town,\u201d says McIntosh. \u201cThere were places you could go for a drink and so on.\u201d The Roman rule of thumb was not to post soldiers in the place they came from, because of the risk of rebellion. That meant Hadrian\u2019s Wall was a cultural melting point, with cohorts from modern-day Netherlands, Spain, Romania, Algeria, Iraq, Syria \u2013 and more. \u201cIt was possibly more multicultural because it was a focus point,\u201d says McIntosh, who says that the surrounding community might have included traders from across the empire. Soldiers were split into two groups. Legionaries were Roman citizens from Italy, who had more rights than other soldiers and imported olive oil, wine and garum (a sauce made from decomposing fish). They worked alongside auxiliaries \u2013 soldiers from conquered provinces, who had fewer rights, but could usually acquire citizenship after 25 years of service. Soldiers carved their names and regiments on stones to show which part of the wall they built \u2013 around 50 of them are on display at Chesters fort. But the wall shows that women and children were equally present. McIntosh says that pottery brought to the camps \u2013 from the Low Countries and North Africa \u2013 shows that the soldiers \u201cbrought their families, who cooked in traditional style.\u201d Archaeologists have found what seems to be an ancient tagine for North African-style cooking. A tombstone from Arbeia fort for a woman named Regina shows she was a freed slave from southern Britain who was bought by \u2013 and married to \u2013 a Syrian soldier. Another woman buried at Birdoswald fort was laid to rest with chainmail that appears to be from modern-day Poland. \u201cPerhaps she married someone in the army,\u201d says McIntosh, who calls the wall a \u201cmelting pot of people from all over the world under the banner of the army.\u201d \u201cThey brought their own religions, as well as worshipping Roman gods and adopting local deities,\u201d she adds. At Carrawburgh, a temple to Mithras \u2013 an originally Persian deity \u2013 sat near a spring with a shrine to a local water spirit. \u2018Wretched little Brits\u2019 Some of the most extraordinary finds from the Roman empire are coming from one site on Hadrian\u2019s Wall: Vindolanda. Here, archaeologists have found a wealth of organic remains because of what curator Barbara Birley calls the \u201cunusual conditions onsite.\u201d At Vindolanda there are the remains of at least nine forts over 14 levels. \u201cWhen the Romans would leave, they would knock down timber forts, and cover the area with turf and clay, sealing the layers underneath,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause it happened so many times, the bottom five or six layers are sealed in anaerobic conditions, so things don\u2019t decay. When we get down there, we get wooden objects, textiles, anything organic.\u201d Vindolanda has the largest collection of Roman textiles from a single site in western Europe, as well as the largest leather collection of any site in the Roman empire \u2013 including 5,000 shoes, and even a broken leather flip-flop. \u201cWe probably had a population of 3,000 to 6,000 depending on the period, so 5,000 is a lot,\u201d says Birley. For Abdy, the shoes evoke the conditions of the wet borderlands. \u201cWomen\u2019s and children\u2019s shoes are hobnailed \u2013 you needed it in the mucky frontier dirt tracks. They\u2019re very evocative.\u201d There\u2019s even a wig made from a local plant, hair moss, which is said to repel midges \u2013 the scourge of Scotland during the summer. A centurion\u2019s helmet is also crested with hairmoss \u2013 the ancient equivalent of spraying yourself with insect repellent. The first woman to write in Latin One of the most famous finds is the trove of wooden writing tablets \u2013 the largest found anywhere. \u201cThey give a snapshot of what life was actually like,\u201d says Birley. \u201cWe understand so much more from written correspondence than from \u2018stuff,\u2019 and, archaeologically, it\u2019s the stuff that usually survives \u2013 things like metals and ceramics. \u201cThese were written in ink, not on a wax stylus tablet, and we believe they were used for what we\u2019d put in emails: \u2018The roads are awful,\u2019 \u2018The soldiers need more beer.\u2019 Everyday business.\u201d The tablets \u2013 or \u201cpersonal letters\u201d as Birley describes them \u2013 were found on the site of a bonfire when the ninth cohort of Batavians (in the modern-day Netherlands) were told to move on. \u201cThey had a huge bonfire and lots of letters were chucked in the fire. Some have been singed \u2013 we think it may have rained,\u201d she says. One of them calls the locals \u201cBritunculi\u201d \u2013 \u201cwretched little Brits.\u201d Another talks about an outbreak of pinkeye. One claims that the roads are too bad to send wagons; another laments that the soldiers have run out of beer. Among the 1,700 letters are 20 that mention a woman called Sulpicia Lepidina. She was the wife of the commander of the garrison, and seems to have played a crucial role. There\u2019s a letter to her from another woman, Paterna, agreeing to send her two medicines, one a fever cure. Birley says it\u2019s similar to today. \u201cIf you\u2019re a group of moms, still today we say, \u2018Do you have the Calpol?\u2019 It\u2019s very human.\u201d For Abdy, it\u2019s a sign that women were traders. \u201cShe\u2019s clearly flogging her medicines,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s really great stuff.\u201d Another tablet is an invite from Claudia Severa, the wife of another commander at a nearby camp. It\u2019s an invitation to a birthday party. Under the formal invitation, presumably written by a scribe, is a scrawl in another hand:\u00a0\u201cI shall expect you, sister. Farewell, sister, my dearest soul.\u201d Presumably written by Claudia herself, it is thought to be the earliest example of a woman\u2019s handwriting in Latin. Without the organic finds \u2013 the shoes and the letters that indisputably belonged to women, unlike jewellery or weaving equipment \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to prove conclusively that women lived in significant numbers. Vindolanda \u201cillustrate the missing gaps,\u201d says Abdy. For Birley, they prove that women were as crucial a part of army communities as men. \u201cBefore the Lepidina tablets were found we didn\u2019t really understand the interactions between the soldiers and their wives,\u201d she says. Another tablet is written by what is thought to be a Spanish standard-bearer\u2019s common-law wife, ordering military equipment for her partner. \u201cThe Vindolanda collection is showing that there weren\u2019t just camp followers and prostitutes; women were part of everyday life, and contributing to the military community in many ways,\u201d says Birley. Abdy says that Hadrian\u2019s Wall is interesting because the resident women span \u201call classes of society,\u201d from Regina \u2013 the dead freedwoman, who would have been \u201cbottom of the heap\u201d \u2013 to the trader Paterna and the noblewoman Lepidina. And of course, there\u2019s the wall itself. \u201cIn the Netherlands and Germany the finds are often stunning and better preserved \u2013 you go to museums and are bowled over. But in terms of structural remains, Hadrian\u2019s Wall must be among the best,\u201d says McIntosh, modestly, of her site. Abdy agrees: \u201cI can\u2019t think of many symbols so redolent of imperial will than that wall.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/hadrians-wall-women-history-vindolanda/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_travel_star-wars-hotel-disney-jenny-nicholson-cec", "text": "In 2023, Disney closed a highly-publicized luxury hotel on the Walt Disney World property called \u201cStar Wars: Galactic Starcruiser.\u201d For Disney superfans, it was a time of high drama and schadenfreude as promises about the hotel\u2019s immersive world ran aground on the rocky reality of some guests\u2019 experiences. Now, a year later, a four-hour-long YouTube deep-dive has resurfaced details about the concept and spread the niche piece of Disney lore to millions of viewers. The creator of the video, YouTuber Jenny Nicholson, is known for her commentary on various corners of fan culture. Some of her most popular videos cover shows and movies like \u201cThe Vampire Diaries,\u201d \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d and installments in the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise. None of them are nearly as long as her most recent video, \u201cThe Spectacular Failure of the Star Wars Hotel.\u201d Over the course of 20 video chapters, Nicholson details her 2022 stay at the \u201cStar Wars: Galactic Starcruiser\u201d hotel in Orlando, Florida. The tale is likely familiar to Disney and Star Wars fans, many of whom heard about the high-dollar, high-concept hotel and its closure in 2023. Nicholson says she paid more than $6,000 for a two-night stay in the hotel, which was supposed to resemble a Star Wars-style spaceship called the Halcyon. The big draw of the hotel lay in what Disney marketing called an \u201cimmersive, customizable Star Wars experience\u201d that Nicholson equated to LARPing, or live-action roleplaying. Guests were encouraged to dress up, and through a combination of live experiences with cast members and choices made in a special app, were guided through a three-day-long Star Wars storyline complete with full itinerary and, if played to its full extent, very little downtime. With Disney-esque details like working lightsabers and colorful themed food, the experience was supposed to feel like a \u201clandlocked cruise,\u201d with all of the entertainment happening onboard the ship \u2014 in reality, a large ultra-secure windowless building near Walt Disney World\u2019s Epcot resort area. Nicholson\u2019s experience squared with some more critical reviews of the hotel: Cramped rooms, inconsistent experiences with technology and a general sense of confusion as to the purpose or audience of the venture. (She also mentioned, at length, some of the things she enjoyed, like cast member performances and details in the ship-hotel\u2019s interior.) Little of this is new information. Disney announced the closing of the Galactic Starcruiser in May 2023, and the hotel served its last guests last September. In a press release provided to CNN from that time, Disney said the project \u201cgave us the opportunity to try new things.\u201d \u201cStar Wars: Galactic Starcruiser is one of our most creative projects ever and has been praised by our guests and recognized for setting a new bar for innovation and immersive entertainment,\u201d the statement read. \u201c\u2026 we will take what we\u2019ve learned to create future experiences that can reach more of our guests and fans.\u201d Still, Nicholson\u2019s video netted more than 2 million views in two days, and has already wormed its way into the social media pipeline of memes and references. Some X users marveled at the fact that they willingly watched a double feature-length video about, as one user said, something they \u201cpreviously never gave a s*** about in my life.\u201d Why yesterday\u2019s drama draws today\u2019s audience Longform videos are an increasingly popular form of YouTube entertainment, and it isn\u2019t unusual to see older topics being reexamined in multi-hour \u201cdeep dives.\u201d Nicholson\u2019s video also combines several winning formulas into one: Disney, Star Wars, insider information (Nicholson includes pictures and videos from her time in the hotel) and, of course, failures. \u201cI couldn\u2019t care less about some dumb Star Wars hotel, but give me those 4 hours,\u201d one X user said. Consumer research from Google claims that longform videos are gaining traction among younger viewers and, interestingly, are even more successful when they cover \u201cfan culture\u201d content. \u201cThere is a healthy appetite for more in-depth exploration of topics such as film, TV, and sports,\u201d a 2022 Google consumer insights report reads. \u201cThese allow for fan-centric creators to share thoughts and ideas at length with an increasingly captive audience: 61% of Gen Z would describe themselves as a \u201creally big\u201d or \u201csuper fan\u201d of someone or something.\u201d Both Star Wars and Disney enjoy particularly loyal fandoms with elephant memories and no qualms about engaging the same topics over and over again. Even the tiniest details in a Star Wars movie or a Disney theme park have cult followings, backstories, fan lore and, of course, their own video deep dives. A spotlight on Disney\u2019s future Nicholson\u2019s video, while not exactly breaking news, drops as Disney prepares a new slate of innovations. Earlier this year, Disney announced a massive 10-year, $60 billion expansion program for its parks, cruises and experiences worldwide. That includes a planned 14-acre expansion at the Magic Kingdom in Orlando\u2019s Walt Disney World and an expansion of the original Disneyland in Anaheim. The company recently got final approval from Anaheim\u2019s city council to move forward with DisneylandForward, a nearly $2 billion investment in the Disneyland resort and surrounding areas. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to build on decades of innovation, creativity, and storytelling to bring new, exciting experiences for our guests,\u201d Disneyland Resort President Ken Potrock wrote in a blog post announcing the approval of the project. In April, Disney CEO Bob Iger said expansion plans for Walt Disney World are on track after the settlement of a long legal battle between Disney and the state of Florida. Iger said the decision \u201cwill actually enable us to pursue the kind of significant investment in our Florida parks.\u201d Disney enthusiasts are expecting a trove of new information this August, when the company hosts its annual D23 Expo that focuses on upcoming projects and attractions. While the Galactic Starcruiser hotel has now earned a place in the annals of Disney lore, renewed interest in its failure provides a new lens through which to see Disney Parks\u2019 ambitions and expansions. Will they live up to everyone\u2019s wildest dreams, or be the subject of the next four-hour YouTube deep dive?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/travel/star-wars-hotel-disney-jenny-nicholson-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "travel"}}

Taquer\u00eda El Califa de Le\u00f3n, located in the San Rafael neighborhood of Mexico City, was among the establishments to garner either one or two stars in the first ever Michelin Guide Mexico, published earlier this week, making it the first Mexican taco stand to receive the honor. Chef Arturo Rivera Mart\u00ednez, who has been serving customers at Taquer\u00eda El Califa de Le\u00f3n for at least two decades, was presented with the famous white chef\u2019s jacket while dishing out his popular tacos on Wednesday. \u201cThe secret is the simplicity of our taco,\u201d Rivera Mart\u00ednez told the Associated Press. \u201cIt has only a tortilla, red or green sauce, and that\u2019s it. That, and the quality of the meat.\u201d Taquer\u00eda El Califa de Le\u00f3n, which is only about 10 feet wide, has been around for more than 50 years and is known for its Gaonera taco, apparently named in honor of Mexican bullfighter Rodolfo Gaona. \u201cThis taqueria may be bare bones with just enough room for a handful of diners to stand at the counter but its creation, the Gaonera taco, is exceptional,\u201d reads a statement on the Michelin Guide website. \u201cThinly sliced beef filet is expertly cooked to order, seasoned with only salt and a squeeze of lime. \u201cAt the same time, a second cook prepares the excellent corn tortillas alongside. The resulting combination is elemental and pure.\u201d When asked which drink he\u2019d recommend that diners match with the \u201cexceptional\u201d tacos, Rivera Mart\u00ednez told reporters, \u201cI like a Coke.\u201d Aside from the aforementioned Gaonera taco, customers can opt for three other meat-filled variations, including a bistec (beef steak) filling, served up on a plastic plate for around $5. \u201cWith meat and tortillas of this caliber, the duo of house-made salsas is hardly even necessary,\u201d says the Michelin Guide. Fine dining restaurant Quintonil, run by chef Jorge Vallejo and Alejandra Flores, awarded two stars, and chef Elena Reygadas\u2019s Rosetta, awarded one star, were among the other establishments included on Michelin\u2019s first-ever rankings for Mexico. Focusing on Mexico City, Oaxaca, Baja California, Los Cabos and Nuevo Le\u00f3n, the Michelin Guide inspectors traveled up and down the country to seek out the best culinary experiences on offer. \u201cWhat a joy it is to honor the uniqueness of the Mexican gastronomic landscape in Mexico City,\u201d Gwendal Poullennec, International Director of the Michelin Guides, said in a statement. \u201cThe first and very promising selection is an an illustration of how the country is showcasing its regions, with their cultures and traditions that are as distinctive as they are distinguishable.\u201d Back in 2016, chef Chan Hon Meng\u2019s Singapore stall became the first street-food establishment to be recognized by the distinguished guide.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/taqueria-el-califa-de-leon-mexico-city/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "travel"}}

Duke Kahanamoku Beach on the island of Oahu crowns the list of the 10 best US beaches put out annually by \u201cDr. Beach,\u201d aka coastal scientist Stephen Leatherman. Kahanamoku is no fluke pick, either. It was the No. 2 beach in Leatherman\u2019s 2023 list. What makes it such a favorite? The sandy haven \u201cis located at the west end of Waikiki Beach, far from the large crowds elsewhere,\u201d Leatherman said in a Thursday news release. \u201cIt is the widest beach on this stretch of world-famous sands and protected by an offshore coral reef, making it a good beach for families with children.\u00a0 The nearby Duke Kahanamoku Lagoon is also a favorite bathing and swimming spot,\u201d said Leatherman, a professor in the Department of Earth & Environment at Florida International University in Miami. Hawaii is king in 2024 The 50th state has the most entries on the top 10, sporting a total of three slots on the coveted list. So if you\u2019re willing to island hop in Hawaii, you can score a top 10 beach trifecta in one state. Like many beautiful places around the world, Hawaii is grappling with how to handle crowds and sometimes unruly tourists, like the ones who trespassed at the Haiku Stairs on Oahu even as they were being dismantled. Go Hawaii, the state\u2019s tourism website, has a webpage devoted to tips on how to respect the islands\u2019 culture and environment. Elsewhere, New York and Florida have two beaches each on the list. And then South Carolina, Massachusetts and California landed one spot each to finish filling out the top 10. Leatherman has been evaluating beaches and producing the annual list since 1991.\u00a0 He uses 50 criteria to grade the beaches, which include water and sand quality, the size of waves, the shape of the beach, wildlife, public safety and cleanliness. If Hawaii isn\u2019t on your travel calendar, the No. 2 beach is in the highly populated Northeast. Coopers Beach, located on Long Island, New York, is \u201cshielded from the cold Labrador currents in the beautiful village of Southampton. The beach is backed by large sand dunes covered by American beach grass interspersed with extravagant mansions,\u201d Leatherman said in the release. Coopers was the No. 3 beach in 2023. The No. 6 beach in the United States is also located on Long Island. As for the Sunshine State\u2019s two entries, both beaches are on the Gulf coast, edging out its Atlantic-facing beaches.

{"id": "travel_bette-nash-longest-serving-flight-attendant-death-hnk-intl", "text": "Bette Nash, holder of the Guinness World Record for longest-serving flight attendant, has died at the age of 88, according to statements from American Airlines and the Association of Professional Flight Attendants. \u201cWe mourn the passing of Bette Nash, who spent nearly seven decades warmly caring for our customers in the air,\u201d American Airlines said in a statement posted to X. \u201cShe started in 1957 and held the Guinness World Record for longest-serving flight attendant. Bette inspired generations of flight attendants. Fly high, Bette.\u201d The Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA), the union representing flight attendants in the United States, posted its own tribute to Nash on Facebook. \u201cBette\u2019s remarkable career spanned over six decades, during which she touched countless lives with her warmth, dedication and unparalleled service,\u201d said the post. \u201cHer passion for flying and her commitment to her passengers were truly inspiring. Bette\u2019s legacy will forever be remembered in the aviation community and by all who had the privilege of knowing her.\u201d Nash started her lifelong career with the now-defunct Eastern Airlines in Washington, DC, on November 4, 1957. In 2016, CNN had an opportunity to fly with her on her daily route from Reagan Washington National to Boston Logan on American Airlines. Nash, who was 80 at the time, said the romance and glamor of flying initially attracted her to the job. \u201cI wanted to be a flight attendant from the time I got on the first airplane \u2013 I was 16 years old, I was sitting with my mother on a green leather couch at Washington [Reagan National Airport], and this crew came up from TWA,\u201d she recalled. \u201cThe pilot and the flight attendant walked across the hall and I thought \u2018Oh my God,\u2019 and I said that was for me.\u201d Nash said she went on to get a college degree, but she never deviated from her dream. She applied for a job as a stewardess, as flight attendants were then known, shortly after graduating. \u201cAnd the rest is history,\u201d she told CNN with a big smile. According to ABC News,\u00a0Nash never officially retired from her role with American Airlines and died on May 17 in hospice care. From blackboards to tablets, Nash has seen it all Nash was awarded the Guinness World Record for having the longest career as a flight attendant in early 2022. \u201cHer career surpasses the last longest flight attendant with 63 years, 61 days as of January 4, 2021,\u201d said the Guinness announcement. Nash saw many changes in the world of aviation over those six-plus decades of flight, telling CNN planes were places of luxury when she started flying, a time when everyone wore their Sunday best and ate lobster on real china. \u201cYou worked harder physically in those days,\u201d said Nash. \u201cWe served this big meal tray. And I was the only one on the plane, so I had to take care of everybody.\u201d But the biggest changes she witnessed over the years related to technology. When Nash first began flying, all flight schedules were chalked up on a blackboard, and manuals and regulations came in book form. Eventually, those papers were replaced with tablets \u2013 which she says was a big adjustment. \u201cTechnology really made the difference of, \u2018Am I going to stay or am I going to go?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut even when I think I might retire or something, then I come to work and think, \u2018Oh, I couldn\u2019t do that.\u2019 It\u2019s stimulating coming out here.

{"id": "travel_theresa-claiborne-first-black-woman-air-force-pilot-retirement", "text": "She\u2019s been flying planes, both military and commercial, for about 43 years, breaking down barrier after barrier along the way. But on May 23, Captain Theresa Claiborne will land her \u201cfinal flight\u201d at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey after traveling from Lisbon, Portugal, with her friends and family in tow. \u201cI\u2019ve had a great career,\u201d Claiborne told CNN Travel via Zoom shortly before setting off for Lisbon. \u201cAnd it\u2019s time for me to park the brakes for the final time on a big airplane.\u201d Retirement flight While she\u2019s looking forward to \u201cclosing that one chapter and starting another,\u201d Claiborne can\u2019t help but get a \u201clittle teary\u201d when she thinks of the \u201cwide-eyed\u201d children who often marvel at her as she strides through an airport in her pilot uniform. \u201cAfter this, walking through the airport, I won\u2019t have a uniform on,\u201d Claiborne says. \u201cPeople will just look at me like I\u2019m just a passenger like everyone else, that\u2019ll be a little different\u2026 I\u2019m hoping that I can still make an impact on the industry. \u201cTo still impart that knowledge on young people, and particularly young black women, that they can do this.\u201d Becoming a pilot was something Claiborne, originally from Virginia, could never have imagined for herself as a young girl. She was about seven years old when she took her first flight \u2013 an international jaunt to Turkey. \u201cMy father was military,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I grew up really all over the world\u2026 I\u2019d been on big airplanes before but never dreamt of flying one.\u201d That all changed when Claiborne joined the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) during college and was given the opportunity to fly in a T-37, a twin-engine jet trainer. \u201cOnce I got that first taste of being in the air and being in command of the airplane, I was like, \u2018Yeah, this is what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d says Claiborne, who was about 20 at the time. Sink or swim While she was keen to apply for undergraduate pilot training, Claiborne explains that the US Air Force was only training 10 women a year at the time and \u201chad already selected the women for my graduating class.\u201d However, this number soon increased, and Claiborne jumped at the opportunity to earn her pilot wings. Around six months after graduating from California State University in Sacramento she began pilot training. \u201cIt\u2019s sink or swim\u2026 Either you make it or you don\u2019t,\u201d she says, pointing out that she found it particularly difficult at first as \u201cshe didn\u2019t have a strong math background.\u201d \u201cI just beared down and made sure that I made it, because that\u2019s the kind of personality I have.\u201d In 1981, Claiborne was commissioned as a second lieutenant and went on to become the first Black woman to fly in the US Air Force the following year. \u201cI did not know until a few weeks before I graduated that that was the case,\u201d she says of the \u201cmind boggling\u201d title. \u201cAnd I often say that I\u2019m really, really happy that I didn\u2019t know. I was 22 years old\u2026\u201d During her years in the US Air Force, Caliborne became the first Black woman to serve as a command pilot and instructor for the KC-135, a mid-air refueling jet. New heights In 1990, she joined United Airlines as a flight officer. At five feet, two inches, Claiborne was two inches shorter than the height required to fly commercial aircraft at other airlines at the time, but she would go on to be a United Airlines captain. When asked about the transition to flying commercial planes, Claiborne stresses that \u201ca pilot is a pilot.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re in different type organizations, but you\u2019re still a pilot,\u201d she adds. Claiborne says she has always prided herself on being the best pilot that she could possibly be, stressing that a big part of this is ensuring that her passengers enjoy the flying experience. \u201cBeing good means that I\u2019m communicating with my passengers at all times,\u201d she says. \u201cThey know what\u2019s going on. That I keep them safe in every way. \u201cObviously, the landing is all-important. I\u2019ve got two more to do really well on.\u201d \u201cI still get chills when I think about the fact that I was the first, and had I not graduated, the statement that that may have made.\u201d Claiborne has chosen Newark, New Jersey, to Lisbon (outbound and inbound) as her swan song, with her mother, along with many of her closest friends and family, coming along for the ride. \u201cI won\u2019t lie, I wanted to go to Paris,\u201d she admits, explaining that she was keen to pay tribute to Bessie Coleman, who moved to Paris to attend aviation school and went on to become the first African-American woman to earn a pilot\u2019s license. \u201cI wanted to recreate the whole Bessie Coleman thing. But Paris out of Newark is on a different airframe.\u201d She eventually decided on the Portuguese capital, largely because there\u2019s a two-day layover on the service, which means that she\u2019ll be able to spend some time enjoying the city with her loved ones. \u201cGenerally, we\u2019re there [at the outbound destination] for 24 hours. So you land, you nap, you find something to eat, you nap again, and you leave. \u201cSo this way, with the Lisbon trip, we have an opportunity to enjoy each other. \u201cAnd my mother\u2019s made many, many, many sacrifices for me. So this is an opportunity for her to really enjoy herself.\u201d Increasing diversity Once she\u2019s landed the United Airlines 787 Dreamliner in Newark, Claiborne will receive the water cannon salute \u2013 a mark of respect that sees two fire engines use their water cannons to create a huge arc over a plane. \u201cThat\u2019s something that retiring people look forward to,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty special.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a pretty emotional person,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m hoping I don\u2019t cry. But I probably will have a few tears. \u201cBecause after all, it\u2019ll be the last time that I\u2019m piloting a big airplane like that.\u201d Claiborne has spent her entire commercial flying career at United Airlines and says she feels blessed to have been able to work for the American airline for so long. \u201cIt\u2019s a good company,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have the most women pilots of any major United States carrier, and I believe we still have the most Black women.\u201d In the US, 93.7% of professional pilots are White and 92.5% of professional pilots are male, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. It\u2019s estimated that there are less than 150 Black women pilots in the US, and Claiborne feels a huge responsibility as one of them. \u201cI do carry the weight on my shoulders of making sure that I continue to perform in a way that other people who look like me get a fair chance,\u201d she says, before recounting how crew members would sometimes assume her co-pilot was the captain earlier in her career. \u201cAfter they\u2019d finished talking, I\u2019d turn around and look and go, \u2018What you got for me?\u2019\u201d she recalls. Claiborne is currently the president of Sisters of the Skies, a not-for-profit organization focused on helping increase the number of Black women pilots, which awards scholarships to \u201cwomen who are able, and who want to be pilots.\u201d Claiborne admits that watching the curtain close on her hugely successful career will be a \u201cbittersweet\u201d experience. \u201cThe biggest barrier to flying an airplane is the money,\u201d she explains, referring to the cost of pilot training\ufeff. \u201cSo that\u2019s what we do.\u201d Claiborne will be stepping down as president of the organization after seven years, but she plans to continue mentoring young girls long into her retirement, as well as write \u201ca couple books.\u201d \u201cThere are a group of women coming up behind me who are members of our organization that are carrying on that legacy,\u201d she adds. While this may be the end of her commercial flying career, Claiborne isn\u2019t necessarily saying \u201cgoodbye\u201d to piloting forever, and would love to fly a World War II aircraft one day. \u201cI\u2019ve had friends that said, \u2018Come on. I\u2019ll take you up.\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cSo I could see myself doing that. That\u2019s on my bucket list too. \u201cI would absolutely love to fly in a Red Tail, an airplane that the Tuskegee Airmen flew.

{"id": "2024_05_28_travel_bolivia-cuisine-top-restaurants-dishes", "text": "Bolivia doesn\u2019t seem like an obvious foodie destination. But the big, landlocked South American country is making waves in the culinary world via top-notch restaurants and transforming foodways pioneered by the ancient Inca and Aymara peoples into modern fusion dishes. Capital city La Paz boasts three eateries \u2014 Gustu, Ancestral and Phayawi \u2014 currently ranked among the top 100 restaurants in Latin America. And more are waiting in the wings. And it\u2019s not just La Paz. Bolivia\u2019s food revolution has also spread to major cities such as Sucre as well as the Uyuni Salt Flats. The new Bolivian cuisine kicked off about a decade ago, according to Marsia Taha, head chef at Gustu. \u201cThere was a generation of new chefs that had a mindset that we should be proud about our identity and our culture and our food,\u201d Taha said. Taha and other likeminded chefs in La Paz coalesced around the concept of \u201czero-kilometer cuisine\u201d \u2014 using as many ingredients as possible that are raised or grown locally and having direct contact with the ranchers or farmers that provide those things. \u201cBy showing that we believe in local products, we were able to show people that Bolivian cuisine could be as great as things coming from outside the country,\u201d adds Sebasti\u00e1n Gim\u00e9nez, chef and co-owner of Ancestral. Revolutionizing Bolivian cuisine It\u2019s not surprising that Gustu has been counted among the continent\u2019s elite dining destinations since first opening its doors in 2013. Co-founder Claus Meyer is a Danish culinary legend who helped pioneer the New Nordic food movement at the Michelin three-star Noma restaurant in Copenhagen, and Gustu is always mentioned among the continent\u2019s top restaurants. Merging Bolivia\u2019s traditional ingredients and food culture with the contemporary Nordic model, Taha and Meyer fashioned a gastronomic melting pot that truly lives up to its name (gustu means \u201cdelicious\u201d in the Quechua language of the Andes). Among the signature dishes are raw Lake Titicaca trout with mango; llama with Amazonian vanilla and ajipa root; Amazon fish with goldenberries and a fermented yuca (cassava); and an out-of-this-world lamb tamale. Taha says that even after a decade in business, she and Gustu\u2019s other chefs are able to keep the concept fresh by traveling around Bolivia to learn about new ingredients and foodways. \u201cLearning how people cook, how they grow their food, and so on. We also give a lot of liberty to our chefs to bring in new ideas.\u201d Variations on the theme Located in the trendy Achumani neighborhood on the south side of La Paz, Ancestral occupies a cozy basement location with floor-to-ceiling windows looking out on a sunken garden. The food is new Bolivian with Basque and Nordic undertones, but the concept is open fire or parrilla-style cooking that revolves around the wood-stoked grill and oven. \u201cWe\u2019re inspired by the biodiversity of Bolivia,\u201d says chef Sebasti\u00e1n Gim\u00e9nez. \u201cWe have jungle, valleys, altiplano, and very high places. We are also inspired by local products and local techniques. We only use Bolivian products, and we only serve Bolivian wines.\u201d But don\u2019t expect traditional Andean or Amazon dishes. Ancestral offers a delicious fusion of old and new in offerings such as the chulet\u00f3n ribeye steak, trout ceviche with grilled corn and sweet potato, and porchetta pork roast with Bolivian tubers and red aji sauce. Manq\u2019a takes another tack. Rather than fine dining, the ambience is decidedly casual, the tables spread across three floors of an old wooden townhouse in the boho Sopocachi neighborhood of central La Paz. It\u2019s especially busy at lunch, a mixed bag of local shoppers, politicians, students and the occasional tourist savoring dishes such as sopa de man\u00ed (peanut soup), gratinated cheese and native potatoes with humacha sauce, soft baked keper\u00ed beef from eastern Bolivia, and surubi catfish from the Amazon served with quinoa, tucupi cassava and edible flowers. Food of the devil The chefs at these top-shelf restaurants don\u2019t have to look far for basic ingredients. Many of the building blocks of their fusion foods are native to the Andes valleys and foothills that extend all the way along Bolivia\u2019s western side from Lake Titicaca to Argentina. More than 4,000 potato types are cultivated in Bolivia and its Andean neighbors, many of them found in just a single, small valley. They come in various shapes, sizes, colors and slightly different flavors. Even more than spuds, Bolivians cherish their quinoa. The country boasts more than 3,100 varieties of quinoa, which contrary to popular opinion is actually the seed of a flowering pseudocereal plant rather than a true grain. An exhibit at the new visitor center in the silver mining town of San Crist\u00f3bal points out that Spanish conquistadors and padres considered quinoa the \u201cfood of the devil\u201d and banned its consumption as a way to control the local indigenous people. Five centuries later, NASA declared quinoa \u201cthe perfect food to grow in indoor greenhouses\u201d during long voyages in outer space because of its resistance to adverse conditions (such as growing in the Andes), versatility and high protein content. No longer vilified as Satan\u2019s feast, it\u2019s also an ideal ingredient for Bolivia\u2019s new-wave cuisine. Zero-kilometer goes wider Sucre, the nation\u2019s judicial capital in south-central Bolivia, isn\u2019t as cosmopolitan as La Paz when it comes to food. But it\u2019s gradually catching up. Located across the street from the city\u2019s Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe, Joy Ride Cafe was founded as a tourist restaurant but evolved into a local hangout for date nights, after-work parties and Sucrense craving burgers, pasta and other global eats. But right down the block is the fusion fare of El Solar. The seven-course degustation menu features dishes such as seafood rice flavored with Amazonian citrus juice, pork belly with pepper sauce and a creamy puree made from plantain and yuca; and beef loin with charque (llama jerky). All of this for 80 bolivianos (roughly $12). Located in southwest Bolivia about 300 miles (500 kilometers) south of La Paz, the otherworldly Salar de Uyuni is the world\u2019s largest and most spectacular salt flat as well as Bolivia\u2019s top tourist attraction. Once upon a time, it was primarily a backpacker destination, but in recent years, more well-heeled travelers (and social media influencers) have sparked a transformation of the local dining scene. Tika restaurant at the Jardines de Uyuni Hotel looks ordinary from the outside, but the kitchen creates Andean-inspired dishes that easily match anything found in Bolivia\u2019s big cities. Chef Tania L\u00f3pez also uses the term \u201czero-kilometer cuisine\u201d to describe the menu at Tika. Among her signature dishes are a sun-dried, shredded llama jerky with local white cheese and a piquant yellow chili pepper sauce, bubbling k\u2019alaphurka corn soup, and lake trout filets in a basil pesto \u201clagoon\u201d with quinoa risotto. L\u00f3pez says one of the closest dishes at Tika to what the ancient Inca may have eaten is the llama potojchi. \u201cPreparation takes more time than beef,\u201d she explains of a succulent dish that resembles goulash. \u201cWe still do this in the traditional way from many centuries ago \u2014 heated on lava rocks.\u201d Dishes that the Incas never tasted \u2014 but would probably die for \u2014 are Tika\u2019s house-made desserts, in particular the quinoa and purple corn ice creams. Tika also does upscale takeaway, meals for a remote picnic that diners can enable on their own or via a 4x4 adventure with Hidalgo Tours, which sets up a table, chairs and bar at a remote location in the middle of the salt flat.\u00a0\u00a0 But that\u2019s not to say that Bolivia\u2019s food revolution has reached every nook and cranny. An hour boat ride from the mainland in the middle of Lake Titicaca, the Isla del Sol (Island of the Sun) is the legendary birthplace of Inca civilization and a place still deeply rooted in the Andean past. On its open-air terrace overlooking the water, the island\u2019s Tacana restaurant serves a traditional pachamanca lunch that includes llama, lake fish, potatoes, corn and other locally sourced dishes \u2014 not all that different than what the Inca rulers would have eaten during their pilgrimages to the island more than 500 years ago.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/travel/bolivia-cuisine-top-restaurants-dishes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_americas_turks-and-caicos-ammunition-american-sentencing-tuesday", "text": "American Tyler Wenrich was sentenced to three weeks in jail and fined Tuesday after he had pleaded guilty earlier this month to possession of ammunition while traveling to Turks and Caicos. The Virginia resident was fined $9,000, Kimo Tynes, the director of communications for the Government of the Turks and Caicos Islands, said in a news statement. Since he had already served three weeks in jail, the court recognized it as time served so his prison sentence is complete, the release said. The 31-year-old American faced as much as a 12-year prison sentence. But the Hon. Justice Davidson Baptiste cited exceptional circumstances in Wenrich\u2019s case and said, \u201cEnforcing the mandatory minimum would have been arbitrary and disproportionate, and would not serve the public interest.\u201d Another American charged with possession of ammunition, Ryan Tyler Watson, pleaded guilty Tuesday, according to Tynes. Watson\u2019s sentencing is scheduled for June 21. In recent months, all were arrested and accused of bringing in various amounts of ammunition to the 40-island chain southeast of the Bahamas. Bringing firearms or ammunition into Turks and Caicos without prior permission from police is \u201cstrictly forbidden,\u201d according to a\u00a0statement\u00a0from its government. In the Turks and Caicos, possession of firearms or ammunition carries a minimum 12-year sentence, though the law allows reduced sentences under \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d  Even though the territory doesn\u2019t manufacture firearms or ammunition, the number of firearms finding their way to the islands has increased, Misick said. Meanwhile, the United States has\u00a0more guns than people. On Friday, American Bryan Hagerich of Pennsylvania pleaded guilty and received a 52-week sentence\u00a0suspended for one year\u00a0and a $6,700 fine, his representatives said. He returned to the United States after paying the fine. In addition to Hagerich and Wenrich, one other American \u2013 Michael Lee Evans \u2013 pleaded guilty to possession of ammunition while traveling in Turks and Caicos, according to the territory\u2019s government. Evans was allowed to return to the US over a \u201csevere\u201d medical situation, but will be required to return to Turks and Caicos for his next hearing, attorney Oliver Smith told CNN. The rest remain in Turks and Caicos. A fifth American, Sharitta Shinese Grier, was arrested last week and is awaiting trial after making bail, according to Tynes\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b, with the Office of the Premier and Public Policy. The mandatory minimum 12-year sentence for possession of firearms or ammunition is in place to protect those on the islands, and judges may use their discretion to impose reduced sentences, Turks and Caicos Gov. Dileeni Daniel-Selvaratnam said. US citizens are not being targeted, Turks and Caicos officials said. Of the 195 people sentenced for firearm-related offenses over the past six years, only seven were US citizens, Misick said Thursday. No US citizen has received the 12-year sentence to date.

Our changing world The Laetoli footprints on the southern edge of Tanzania\u2019s Serengeti Plains are the oldest known footprints of our earliest human ancestors and the first evidence of an upright walking hominid. However, they\u2019re now at risk of being destroyed because of erosion from increasing storms and rainfall. The site is one of 22 new projects to be funded by the British Council\u2019s Cultural Protection Fund, which protects cultural heritage at risk from conflict and/or the climate crisis. In the skies, severe airplane turbulence is something we could be seeing more of in the years to come because of climate change, and the episodes might last longer, too. Here\u2019s why. One person was killed and 104 were injured on board a Singapore Airlines plane Tuesday after the aircraft rapidly plunged before ascending several hundred feet, then repeated the drop and climb. Meteorologists say the plane likely met with fast-developing thunderstorms. And in Dubai, which was recently hit by rains so heavy its airport was flooded, a city developer hopes to combat the climate crisis with its plans to build what it\u2019s calling the \u201cworld\u2019s largest coastal regeneration project,\u201d by planting more than 100 million mangroves.

A Hawaiian stretch of sand has been named the finest. The beaches are ranked using criteria including water and sand quality, the size of waves, wildlife, public safety and cleanliness. The good doctor would be unimpressed by the situation in the UK, where sewage-engulfed beaches have become a national scandal. Here why things have gone down the drain.

{"id": "travel_africas-richest-man-needs-35-visas", "text": "Even Africa\u2019s wealthiest man has trouble traveling in his own continent. Despite doing business in multiple countries, Nigerian-born Aliko Dangote complains he faces far more hurdles crossing Africa than visitors with European passports ever do. \u201cAs an investor, as someone who wants to make Africa great, I have to apply for 35 different visas on my passport,\u201d Dangote told the recent Africa CEO Forum in Kigali. \u201cI really don\u2019t have the time to go and drop off my passport in embassies to get a visa,\u201d he said to laughter from the audience. The 67-year-old entrepreneur\u2019s visa woes have reignited a fresh firestorm about the frustrations of traveling within Africa for Africans. It\u2019s even more infuriating for many Africans that European passports from former colonial masters have more visa-free access in Africa than many African passports. It\u2019s a point Dangote made powerfully in Kigali, when he turned to the French executive next to him and deadpanned: \u201cI can assure you that Patrick (Pouyann\u00e9, CEO of Total Energies) doesn\u2019t need 35 visas on a French passport, which means you have freer movement than myself in Africa.\u201d Dangote commended Rwanda, which eliminated visas for all African nationals in 2023. Benin, The Gambia and Seychelles also offer visa-free access to all Africans. But many African countries still require visas from other Africans and the experience is fraught with discrimination, hostility and sky-high fees. \u2018Humiliating experience\u2019 Nigerian travel filmmaker Tayo Aina says he was forced to give a stool sample in front of an Ethiopian immigration officer, to confirm he hadn\u2019t ingested any drugs, when he landed in Addis Ababa in April 2021. \u201cIt was my most humiliating experience traveling within Africa,\u201d he told CNN by phone from London. He has also been detained at airports in Kenya and South Africa because of his Nigerian passport. This year, Aina announced that he bought a passport from the Caribbean country of St Kitts and Nevis for $150,000 so he can travel more freely. \u201cSometimes you go to a country, and it is no longer visa-on-arrival. There are cases where people get deported when they land because they changed the policy mid-flight,\u201d the 31-year-old YouTuber says. The African Union has said one of its goals is to remove \u201crestrictions on Africans\u2019 ability to travel, work and live within their own continent by transforming restrictive laws and promoting visa-free travel\u201d but implementation has been slow. Free movement within the continent is a critical part of the African Continental Free Trade Area, but action hasn\u2019t followed the commitments. The fear of permanent migration is one of the reasons why African nations don\u2019t make it easy for other Africans to visit, migration researcher Alan Hirsch told CNN. \u201cThere\u2019s a fear in richer African countries that people from poorer nations might be looking for a way to permanently move there,\u201d he explains. \u201cA lot of Africans cross borders informally and we don\u2019t have a real record of that. Some countries fear people applying for asylum and then disappearing under the radar.\u201d The retired University of Cape Town professor runs a program on migration at the New South Institute think tank in Johannesburg. He says the integrity of passport and visa systems especially in poorer African countries has also held back Africans\u2019 mobility. \u201cPeople have found illegal ways of obtaining passports, for example someone pretending to be Burundian without actually being from that country.\u201d Fresh bottlenecks While Africans can move relatively freely within their regions, traveling further away is still challenging. Travelers from East African Community countries don\u2019t need a visa within the block and most parts of Southern and West Africa are open to nationals from the respective regions. But even what looks like progress can introduce some fresh bottlenecks. A Nigerian visa on arrival used to be $25 for Kenyan passport holders. But after changes to the application process, Kenyans now have to apply for a Nigerian e-visa in advance, at a cost of $215. Kenyan President William Ruto famously promised to eliminate visas for everybody traveling to the East African nation. He introduced an Electronic Travel Authorization instead but the application process is similar to that of a visa. It costs $30 without processing fees and approval may take several days. Many visa applications require an application form, bank statements, flight and hotel bookings. Applicants are often rejected for incomplete documentation or for unclear reasons. \u201cSouth Africa held my passport for almost five months,\u201d the Nigerian content creator Tayo says.

{"id": "travel_article_how-to-survive-alligator-attack", "text": "Jeffrey Heim woke up on May 30, 2021, with one thing on his mind: Sharks.  Specifically, shark teeth. They\u2019re his passion and his business. An unsuccessful attempt the day before to find any of them only fueled his obsession to find some on his next outing, he told CNN Travel recently. So on a hot, sunny Sunday in Sarasota County, Florida, the 25-year-old Heim proceeded to the Myakka River on a spot about 45 minutes from the Gulf of Mexico. He had been there numerous times and was comfortable with plunging into its murky waters to find the teeth of extinct megalodons in the riverbed. He put on his wetsuit, mask, fins and snorkel and entered the water from the shore, not far from a restaurant along the riverbank.  Heim slipped beneath the surface. He was under no more than one minute when he felt something. Something bad. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything, didn\u2019t see anything. I just felt like a blunt force object \u2013 like someone \u2026 swinging a baseball bat and just whacking my head. But mostly what I felt was what I thought was a huge boat just slamming into me and just pulling me down.\u201d To his shock, it wasn\u2019t a boat.  He was in the water, alone and face-to-face with an alligator.  Gator attacks: Rare but fascinating   Heim was in a situation many people probably fear but very few actually experience: an attack by an alligator. An estimated 5 million wild American alligators are spread out across 10 states in Southeast and beyond, including parts of North Carolina and even the extreme southeastern tip of Oklahoma. Louisiana has an estimated 2 million wild gators in a state of about 4.65 million people. Florida sports roughly 1.25 million alligators (and more than 1,000 American crocodiles). Georgia has about a quarter of a million. Some of these gators inhabit places where lots of people live and many others vacation, such as lakes and rivers all across Florida and coastal South Carolina. Yet gator attacks aren\u2019t that frequent and deaths even more infrequent (deadly attacks from dogs and horses and other mammals are more common). There were 442 unprovoked bite incidents in Florida from 1948 to 2021, and 26 of these bites resulted in people dying, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conversation Commission. It turns out gators, in natural conditions, simply aren\u2019t that interested in people, according to Kimberly Andrews, a gator and snake expert with a doctorate in ecology from University of Georgia\u2019s Marine Extension and Georgia Sea Grant and who manages its Coastal Ecology Lab.  \u201cWe are not their prey. If you think about it, we\u2019re quite dangerous to attack. We\u2019ve got arms and legs. We can stand upright. We can walk, we can swim. \u2026 We\u2019re not a good animal to pick a fight with.\u201d \u201cUnless they\u2019re confronted, they\u2019re going to stay on their own turf.\u201d Nonetheless, people continue to be fascinated by such possible encounters. Overblown reputation     Andrews wants to dispel the notion of gators as aggressive, ravenous menaces on the move. \u201cThey\u2019re called ambush predators. We also call these \u2018sit-and-wait\u2019 predators,\u201d she said.  They\u2019re large, so it\u2019s \u201cenergetically costly for them to be really active. \u2026 We would be considered an active forager. We go out and find our food.\u201d Not so with gators. \u201cWhen you come down to it, they\u2019re not that maneuverable. Large body. Small legs. And this also plays into why the perception of their danger is exaggerated from the actuality.\u201d  Nonetheless, caution is advised when you\u2019re in gator territory, be that at golf courses, swamps, lakes, rivers and hiking and bike trails and fishing spots along waterways. Best defense: Avoid an attack  Education is key to avoiding a bad encounter, Andrews said. Start with knowing when gators are most active. Courtship season starts as spring warms up; mating extends in early summer; and in Okefenokee Swamp in southeastern Georgia, \u201cwe start to see eggs hatch out starting in September and October. \u2026 And that\u2019s when the females are most protective when they feel someone is threatening their babies,\u201d Andrews said. Your best season is winter: If it\u2019s cold, \u201cthey\u2019re not doing whole lot.\u201d When temperatures start settling into the 80s (27 Celsius), gators become mostly nocturnal. So it\u2019s best to avoid that refreshing night dip in unknown waters when it\u2019s hot. Don\u2019t provoke, don\u2019t feed, don\u2019t panic   Unprovoked attacks are rare, Andrews said. People are usually the provocateurs, not the gators. Gators can be disturbed or confused when folks have been known to try to grab them by their tails or go in for close-up photos of sunning gators Even worse, people will feed them. Then the reptiles start to associate humans with food. That\u2019s when gators can be most dangerous \u2013 when they\u2019ve lost their natural fear or disinterest in people. \u201cThey\u2019re more likely to take the easy way out and get our food than to do the work to fight for it,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cIn areas where we have high rates of tourism but not a lot of education and oversight of how people are interacting with alligators, we see feeding issues.\u201d  If you do have a gator encounter, she suggests staying calm and respecting its territory  \u201cSay you\u2019re kayaking, and you see an alligator, just keep going past it. Give it a wide berth, as much as the space will allow,\u201d Andrews said.  \u201cDon\u2019t take the paddles and slap the water. Sometimes people do that to scare the alligator off,\u201d but you\u2019re actually indicating you\u2019re a direct threat.  \u201cIf for some reason they start to swim toward you \u2026 usually try to go in the other direction and just show you\u2019re not interested. Or paddle right on by and ignore the animal.\u201d Also, never mess with the reptiles\u2019 children. \u201cWe always tell people that those one-foot baby alligators, even though they\u2019re so cute, they\u2019re the most dangerous sized alligator to mess with.\u201d That\u2019s because there\u2019s possibly a nearby mother ready to protect her young. More ways to avoid an attack   Authoritative websites have plenty of good advice to avoid a dangerous encounter. From the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory at the University of Georgia: \u2022 Don\u2019t feed ducks, turtles or other animals that share waters with alligators.  \u2022 Stay about 60 feet (18 meters) or more away from an adult alligator. If an alligator hisses or lunges at you, you are too close. \u2022 If you\u2019re driving, let an alligator cross the road. They move across roadways the most often in spring and summer.  \u2022 Supervise pets and children when you\u2019re in gator territory. \u201cLarge alligators do not recognize the difference between domestic pets and wild food sources,\u201d the SREL says. \u2022 Avoid heavy vegetation in and near the water\u2019s edge.  The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission also advises: \u2022 Never swim outside of posted areas, and swim only during daylight hours. Alligators are most active between dusk and dawn. \u2022 Get rid of fish scraps in garbage cans at boat ramps and fish camps; don\u2019t toss them in the water. Experts also advise people to call local or state authorities if you see alligators roaming around neighbors and other places you wouldn\u2019t expect. Do not try to handle the reptiles yourself. As for Jeffrey Heim, these tips were more than theory. Mission: Survival   Heim was in serious trouble, and he knew it. The gator had already bit him in the skull and on the hand. And it was coming toward him again. The gator \u201cpulled my mask off and pulled my head down towards my stomach. And then I come up, head above water. I no longer have the mask with the GoPro that\u2019s filming. And we\u2019re both looking at each other, and we both sit there for about two or three seconds, and I feel my head.\u201d  He wasn\u2019t sure what he was feeling at the time, but he learned later it was his scalp, partially torn off his skull and flapping in the water. Then \u201cshe lunges at me and I back away calmly \u2026  like I would with my experience with sharks, you don\u2019t want to act like prey. So I just backed away to keep my space.\u201d \u201cAnd then she really aggressively lunged at me \u2026\u201d  What to do if you\u2019re attacked   Heaven forbid you\u2019re that person like Heim who is being attacked by an alligator. Would you know what to do? If the gator is trying to drag you under the water, \u201cyou have to assume at this point you\u2019re fighting for your life, and you\u2019ve got to give it all you\u2019ve got,\u201d Andrews said.  \u201cWe recommend trying to poke them in the eye, hitting them in the top part of the skull or the side of the jaw. Those points are sensitive on alligators just like they are on us,\u201d she said. In a water attack, the danger is more from drowning than the bite, Andrews said. So get to land if possible. \u201cWe\u2019re better on land than they are. They\u2019re better in the water.\u201d But don\u2019t assume all is safe if you\u2019re on land. And the alligator has more in its arsenal that a fearsome set of teeth.  You can be injured if you\u2019re hit by the tail. Gators can also whip around with their skull and use it like a battering ram. Andrews knows first-hand how dangerous that can be.   She was part of a capture team once that had a gator taped up and its mouth secured when it unexpectedly whipped its head around.  \u201cIt actually hit me broad with the side of its head across my shins \u2026 and I blacked out. And I wondered, \u2018Oh my gosh, did I fracture my shin bone?\u2019 I had a lump the size of a tennis ball. It is amazing how muscular and powerful they are,\u201d Andrews recalled. The gator uses its mouth. Use yours. \u201cScream, make as much noise [as you can], not only fight back but make yourself as big and as much a pain in the rear end as you possibly can.\u201d If people are nearby, they should call 911 for help, Andrews said. If a pole is nearby, someone can beat on the gator and give it another target.  \u201cAnother person in an attempt to rescue you should never come in the water after you and the alligator. They can help you most by being on the ground and helping you get to the ground,\u201d Andrews said.  Other ways to fend off an attack   Here are some more survival tips from various wildlife departments and other experts: \u2022 If you can escape on land, run away in a straight line. Experts debunk the advice to zig-zag. Gators can move really fast on land, but only in short bursts and distances before they tire out. \u2022 Try to cause a gag reflex by jamming any objects you can reach into the back of the alligator\u2019s mouth. \u2022 Sometimes a gator will reposition its prey in its mouth. With its jaw back open, that is your chance to escape. \u2022 \u201cAlligators clamp down with powerful jaws, then twist and roll. If an alligator bites your arm, it may help to grab the alligator and roll with it to reduce tearing of the arm,\u201d according to advice from the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources. \u2022 Get immediate medical attention if bitten. Alligator bites often result in serious infection.   All of this is specific to American alligators, Andrews emphasizes.  Other crocodilian species in places such as Africa and Australia can be more aggressive. We\u2019re actually prey-sized for some of these, she said.  But the relatively few crocodiles in southern Florida aren\u2019t known for attacking people. The escape   One of Andrews\u2019 survival tips came in very hand handy as the female gator lunged yet again at Heim. \u201cI really backed away. Got out of that river as quickly as I could. I climbed out of the six-foot bank and stumbled over to the parking lot.\u201d He was about to pass out, but he was able \u201cto yell over to some people over at that restaurant.\u201d Fortunately, they heard his cries for help and were able to assist him with a first aid kit from the restaurant and call 911. While waiting for the paramedics, he wasn\u2019t in pain. But \u201cthe whole time I\u2019m sitting down just super loopy and exhausted. That\u2019s when I thought I was going to die.\u201d He ended up in the ICU in a hospital for two days but was back at work the next week \u201cwith staples in my head.\u201d  Lessons learned   Heim has now had time to reflect on what he did that day and on what others can learn from his attack. \u201cI knew there were gators there. This day, I basically did everything wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cI was aware it was gator mating season, but I went to the river with too much confidence, especially being alone, and free diving, which I had never done in that river before.\u201d \u201cThat cockiness, or confidence, led to the bite, honestly, even though this was an uncharacteristically aggressive alligator apparently. It was still the wrong time of year to go.\u201d  Like other young people who have spent time in the watery wilds in the Southeast, he was lulled into a false sense of security because he had been around gators before with no ill results. \u201cI was casually looking around for gators, but if I had even seen one, I had dove with them before and it hadn\u2019t caused an issue.\u201d \u201cI think the difference was this was near a restaurant, and fed gators are the most aggressive gators. So that\u2019s what the gator professionals believe contributed to this attack, too,\u201d Heim said.   \u201cIf you\u2019re going to dive in a river like that, which I don\u2019t suggest anymore, don\u2019t free dive. You\u2019re going to go up and down like their prey. And you\u2019re going to look much smaller that you actually are.\u201d \u201cWeigh all risks. Anything can happen at anytime to anyone. None of us are invincible. And I think it was the youth in me being a little too confident.\u201d  Heim has been chastened, but not chased off. He continues to search for shark teeth and has ramped up operations for his business, SHRKco. His approach is different now. He\u2019s more cautious. He said he has more and better equipment. He\u2019s even been diving back in the Myakka twice since the attack. However, he now goes with other people, including gator experts.  Andrews said it\u2019s crucial for people to co-exist with alligators because they\u2019re an Indispensable part of the ecology as an apex predator keeping populations of other animals in check. \u201cIn the South, they\u2019re part of our heritage. What a charismatic and iconic feature of our landscapes. It should be: We like our sweet tea. We like our grits. We like our alligators. This is part of who we are.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/article/how-to-survive-alligator-attack/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_article_chance-encounters-florence-italy-kacie-rose", "text": "Kacie Rose Burns walked into the Florence jazz bar, alone. \u201cI\u2019ll go for one song and suss it out,\u201d she thought, trying to quieten her nerves. Kacie slipped in at the back. The club was dark and busy, a few wall lights and neon signs illuminating people drinking, dancing and chatting. Before she could even take in the musicians on stage, Kacie\u2019s eyes landed on a tall man sitting at the bar. \u201cI walked in and he was there,\u201d Kacie tells CNN Travel today. \u201cWe clocked eyes.\u201d \u201cCiao,\u201d said the stranger, smiling. \u201cCiao,\u201d Kacie said back, before adding apologetically: \u201cThat\u2019s all the Italian I\u2019ve got for you.\u201d It was October 2018. Kacie was a 24-year-old New Yorker on vacation in Florence. It was her first time in Italy and her first time traveling solo. It was an exciting \u2013 and terrifying \u2013 experience. \u201cI was a professional dancer in New York,\u201d explains Kacie. \u201cA very exhausting career \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of toxicity, a lot of rejection, there\u2019s a lot of politics that come into play \u2013 and I was feeling a little stuck, a little unhappy, a little \u2013 just stagnant, if you will.\u201d Kacie spent her days auditioning, traveling for gigs and moonlighting at a clothing store. She needed a break, and she\u2019d long felt a \u201cpull\u201d to Italy and dreamed of an Italian vacation. \u201cI kept saying, \u2018I\u2019ll wait for somebody to go with, I\u2019ll wait, I\u2019ll wait. And then I was waiting for years. And so then one night \u2013 at two in the morning \u2013 I was like, \u2018What am I waiting for? Life is too short.\u2019 So I booked a solo trip to Italy.\u201d Kacie planned to spend the majority of her time in Rome and Venice and just a couple of days in Florence. But in the lead-up to the trip, she got chatting to a customer at the store she worked at. This woman had lived in Florence for five years and sung the Tuscan city\u2019s praises, persuading Kacie to add an extra day to her Florence stint. And that\u2019s how Kacie and the Italian stranger happened to be in the jazz club on the same evening. \u201cI\u2019m really glad that I listened to her,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cThat\u2019s the only reason why we met on the first night that I was in Florence, on that earlier day that I wasn\u2019t originally supposed to be there.\u201d A Florence meeting The man Kacie crossed paths with in the jazz bar was 26-year-old Dario Nencetti, a chef in a Florence hotel who usually worked nights. It just so happened that was the only evening he had off that week. The jazz bar, called Jazz Club Firenze, was one of Dario\u2019s favorite hangouts. He loved the music, the underground ambiance and the fact the bar encouraged punters to sign up for jam sessions. \u201cThat place is, let\u2019s say, unconventional for Florence,\u201d Dario tells CNN Travel. \u201cUsually in Florence, there\u2019s like a table for two or three or four people. In the jazz club, there are big tables, so you can sit with strangers and stuff, which I love.\u201d When Dario realized Kacie didn\u2019t know much Italian beyond \u201cciao,\u201d they switched to English. Dario told Kacie he\u2019d lived in Scotland for a year, and they got talking about travel. Kacie mentioned she was on her first solo trip and Dario said he\u2019d embarked on a similar adventure to Japan earlier that year. \u201cWe bonded from the beginning,\u201d says Dario. \u201cIt was really natural, really easy conversation.\u201d \u201cI remember he made me laugh,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Oh, this guy\u2019s interesting.\u201d So many people ask us, \u2018How did you know?\u2019 And I don\u2019t know how I knew. I was just like, \u2018Oh, this is something different.\u2019\u201d Kacie and Dario stayed at the jazz bar talking into the early hours of the morning. Then they spent as much time as possible together over the next two days. \u201cHe would meet me after his work \u2013 every night he got off at 11. And we would go out and we would just talk,\u201d recalls Kacie. \u201cI instantly fell in love with Florence. It\u2019s a very romantic city - cobblestone streets and medieval buildings. It looks like a painting everywhere you look.\u201d It was a whirlwind two days. One evening they sat by Florence\u2019s Ponte Vecchio bridge and talked until 3 or 4 a.m. It was as though Kacie was in a film \u2013 somewhere between every millennial\u2019s favorite \u201cThe Lizzie McGuire Movie\u201d and classic Florentine romance \u201cA Room with a View.\u201d Then, the two days were up and Kacie had to continue onto the next leg of her trip. It was still like something from a movie \u2013 only it wasn\u2019t obvious this one had a happy ending. \u201cI got on the train and he was standing on the platform. And I remember looking out the train, and I was so sad,\u201d she says. As the train pulled away from the station, Kacie wiped away tears and messaged her best friend back home in New York. \u201cI just met my future husband in Florence,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s the guy I\u2019m gonna marry. I\u2019m never gonna see him again.\u201d Her friend tried to cheer her up. \u201cYou\u2019re going to Rome,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYou\u2019ll meet a gladiator!\u201d But Kacie knew what she had with Dario wasn\u2019t replaceable. \u201cWe never stopped talking. We FaceTimed every single day,\u201d she says. This continued when Kacie was back in the US. And before long, Dario was planning a trip to visit New York. A New York minute On December 8, 2018 Dario arrived in the US. Kacie spent a week introducing Dario to her life in New York. \u201cIt was really cool to see it through his eyes,\u201d she says. \u201cShe showed me the real city,\u201d says Dario. Then the couple flew to Miami for a week\u2019s vacation. For Kacie and Dario, there was never a specific moment where they decided to embark on a relationship. \u201cIt was never a decision to be made,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cIt just went without saying,\u201d agrees Dario. \u201cBut I can\u2019t hide it, long distance was hard.\u201d The two struggled with time zones and their busy jobs that left them with little downtime, but tried to visit each other whenever they could. Cut to September 2019. Dario was back in New York visiting Kacie. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I move here?\u201d he suggested. He\u2019d loved the vibrancy of the city from the get-go and could see himself there. The restaurant scene was incredible. If he could find a job and organize the visa, it seemed like the ideal scenario. Kacie thought so too, so Dario started asking around. He was eventually hired as a chef at an Italian restaurant in Brooklyn. After a couple of months in limbo, his visa was approved. \u201cUp until that point, every time that we had to say goodbye it was borderline traumatic \u2013 we had spent this week together and we knew that this was it for each other,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cSaying goodbye in airports sucked. It would take like a week to recover.\u201d But now the airport goodbyes were consigned to the past. \u201cIt was really exciting,\u201d says Dario. Moving forward together Kacie and Dario spent three months in New York together, giddy with happiness to be in the same country and the same city. Then the pandemic hit. New York City\u2019s performing arts and restaurant industries ground to a halt. Stuck at home, Kacie and Dario found solace and support in one another. As Kacie puts it, she and Dario found \u201cmany silver linings\u201d in this tough time. Dario taught Kacie how to make pasta. They cat-sat. They spent long evenings chatting. But as 2020 rolled on, the couple were aware there was a deadline hanging over them. Dario\u2019s visa was set to run out in December and in the wake of the pandemic, renewal was out of the question. For Kacie and Dario, it seemed like there were only three viable choices: return to long distance, get married or move to Italy. Going back to long distance would mean the return of those airport goodbyes, the last thing either of them wanted. And while Kacie and Dario thought marriage was in their future, they didn\u2019t feel it was right for them at that point. That left moving to Italy. Kacie thought about her career in New York. Performing was off the table and there was no return date in sight. And while her friends were regularly posting on social media about how much they missed dancing, Kacie only felt \u201crelief\u201d that her days were no longer defined by auditioning and uncertainty. \u201cThat was a pretty big wake-up call,\u201d she says. \u201cI had gotten to a point where I needed to take a little step back from performing.\u201d On top of this, Kacie\u2019s New York apartment lease was up. If there was ever a time to relocate to Italy, it was now. \u201cEverything kind of fell into place,\u201d she says. Kacie researched online and found a language academy in Florence offering study visas. She applied, enrolling in Italian lessons. Then, Kacie and Dario packed up their life in New York and got ready to move across the Atlantic. Before stepping on the plane in January 2021, Kacie posted a video to TikTok about meeting Dario and the move to Italy. She\u2019d never posted much on the platform before, but felt inspired to mark this significant life step. When she stepped off the plane and connected to Wi-Fi, her cell phone was blowing up. \u201cIt went viral,\u201d says Kacie. While stuck inside during mandatory two-week quarantine, Kacie continued posting TikTok videos. Her following continued to grow. While her social media presence was getting bigger, for the first few months in Florence, Kacie and Dario\u2019s IRL world remained small. Italy was still in the thrall of Covid, with strict restrictions. But as Kacie studied for her Italian lessons and taught English online and Dario looked for restaurant work, Florence started to slowly reopen. \u201cI remember the first time going to the Duomo. And there was nobody there,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cWhich is crazy, because it\u2019s like the main focus point of Florence. And there\u2019s nobody in the piazza and I remember how bizarre that was.\u201d While that moment was surreal \u2013 even sad \u2013 Kacie and Dario still felt grateful to be at the Florentine landmark together. They\u2019d come a long way, and they were excited for their new life together in Italy. Acclimatizing to Italian life was made easier for Kacie by Dario\u2019s family, who welcomed her wholeheartedly \u2013 even if, in the early days, Kacie struggled with Italian and Dario\u2019s mother didn\u2019t know much English. The two women made communication work by using Google Translate on their cell phones. \u201cThey bonded immediately,\u201d says Dario. Kacie continued to post on social media, and her following ballooned. After about six months, she stopped teaching English online and decided to do social media full time. Dario encouraged this step. \u201cI think it was a really good idea diving into it,\u201d he says today. \u201cIt was the right moment, the right time, and I believed in her from the first moment.\u201d A life together in Italy Almost four years later, Kacie\u2019s expanded her social media presence into a travel company, running group tours around Italy and publishing her own travel guides. Meanwhile, Dario is still passionate about cooking and now works as a fine dining chef at a Florence restaurant. \u201cI really love the life we\u2019ve created here,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cWe live in a beautiful place with great food and he\u2019s got so many awesome things going for him and same with me.\u201d The couple encourage each other in their respective careers and endeavors, but they also savor their downtime. They love living in Florence and exploring Italy together. Dario and Kacie are settled in Florence for now, although they don\u2019t rule out a move elsewhere in the future. \u201cWe\u2019re enjoying the moment,\u201d says Dario. \u201cThe solid thing is the fact that we know we\u2019re in it together. And that\u2019s what makes it so great,\u201d says Kacie. She tells Dario: \u201cI\u2019m not nervous for what the future holds. Because I\u2019ve got you.\u201d Looking back, Kacie finds it serendipitous and surreal to think her spontaneous decision to travel solo in Italy led her to find a new career, a new home and the love of her life. \u201cThere were so many things that had to happen for it to actually happen, but it just felt normal and natural \u2013 like of course this is right and this was supposed to happen,\u201d she says. \u201cYou never really know what life has planned for you. There\u2019s so many good things waiting. You just have to trust it,\u201d adds Kacie. \u201cTrust in the process. And the path that is meant for you will happen, even if it\u2019s not the path that you intended to take for yourself.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/article/chance-encounters-florence-italy-kacie-rose/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "travel"}}

Discovered in 2015 in waters off the coast of the port city of Cartegena by the Colombian government, the San\u00a0Jos\u00e9 is\u00a0often called the \u201choly grail of shipwrecks.\u201d The 62-gun, three-masted ship \u2013 the flagship and largest galleon of a Spanish fleet \u2013 was believed to have been carrying gold, silver, emeralds and other valuable goods from the mines of Potosi, Peru. It was said to have been traveling from Panama to Colombia when it sank\u00a0with 600 people reportedly on board on June 8, 1708, during a battle with British ships\u00a0in the War of the Spanish Succession. The first stage of the expedition will focus on photographing the ship using \u201cnon-intrusive\u201d remote sensors, the\u00a0Colombian Institute of Anthropology and History (ICANH) said, adding that results of the initial expedition could pave the way for subsequent explorations, which would\u00a0include recovering archaeological materials from the shipwreck. The images will then be used to build an inventory of the archaeological discoveries on the seabed. ICANH has also declared the\u00a0discovery site a national \u201cprotected archaeological area\u201d to \u201cpreserve its scientific and archaeological value.\u201d Researchers say they also plan to use an underwater vessel with acoustic positioning technologies, as well as\u00a0a remote operation vehicle with various sensors and tools that can descend to the depth of the site. \u201cThis government is doing something that is unprecedented\u2026 exploring the sinking of the galleon as the possibility of understanding history and culture,\u201d Culture Minister Juan David Correa told a news conference in Cartagena on Wednesday, where the expedition was also launched. Billion dollar legal battle over rights The San Jos\u00e9\u2019s discovery has been significant for Colombia because of the ship\u2019s treasure of cultural and historical artifacts \u2013 and clues they may provide about Europe\u2019s economic, social and political climate during the early 18th century. But it has also sparked a multi-billion dollar legal battle. Colombia maintains that it first discovered the San\u00a0Jos\u00e9 in 2015 with help from international scientists. But their claims have been disputed by a US-based marine salvaging company named Sea Search-Armada (SSA), formerly known as Glocca Morra, which argues that\u00a0they were the ones who had discovered the shipwreck in the early 1980s. SSA has launched a legal battle against the\u00a0Colombian government in the Permanent Court of Arbitration, claiming it is entitled to approximately $10 billion \u2013 half the estimated value of the shipwreck\u2019s treasure. The Colombian government\u00a0disputes SSA\u2019s claims. The loss of the San Jos\u00e9 and its cargo was said to have caused financial hardships to merchants throughout Europe and the New World, according to reports released by SSA.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/travel/san-jose-colombia-shipwreck-expedition-discovery-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_anantara-santorini-abu-dhabi-uae", "text": "White, domed buildings cascading into crystal blue waters. To the eye, it\u2019s unmistakable. It\u2019s the world-famous holiday destination of Santorini, Greece. But, something feels different. Perhaps it\u2019s the hotter desert-climate breeze, or the Arabic calligraphy across the signage. A few hints here and there point towards the resort\u2019s actual location: Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. The Anantara Santorini Abu Dhabi Retreat opened in February this year and is an hour\u2019s drive away from the capital\u2019s downtown. The concept is entirely inspired by the renowned Greek island. Inside and out, it\u2019s a world of white, beige and blue, marked by arched corridors and doorways. Its bespoke artwork, ambient music and detailed embroidery on the linen all add up to a Mediterranean fantasy. Yet, beyond the intricate d\u00e9cor, for Rachid Bakas, the property\u2019s general manager, it\u2019s Abu Dhabi\u2019s natural beauty that truly draws the link between both locations. \u201cYou see the color of the sea next to us, and then the concept really comes together,\u201d says Bakas. \u201cThe idea of Santorini really fits within this location, and that\u2019s what makes this design immaculate.\u201d Not \u2018Chinatown\u2019 or \u2018Disneyland\u2019 Replicas are not usually marketed as a luxurious experience. But, Anantara Santorini could be an exception. Its lowest-priced room costs approximately $800 per night. That\u2019s double the average of Greece\u2019s Santorini hotels during high season, according to Tripadvisor. If the price isn\u2019t an advantage, why would a traveler prefer to visit the hotel in Abu Dhabi, and not fly to Greece? \u201cIt\u2019s exclusive,\u201d says Bakas. \u201cThis gives you that intimacy, this gives you that privacy. It\u2019s a hideaway \u2013 which you might not have actually in Santorini because especially in summer, everywhere is packed, everywhere is busy.\u201d Structurally, the hotel is divided into 22 rooms, accommodating a maximum of 44 guests at a time. All rooms lead to a living room-like common area, purposefully giving a very homey atmosphere, while encouraging visitors to walk through the facility\u2019s different environments. \u201cThe element of surprise is within the hotel itself and from the moment you walk, you keep discovering some nice corners and spaces,\u201d says Bakas. Anantara Santorini offers a range of experiences, including a cigar lounge, a cinema, a spa and yoga sessions by the pool or beach. Yet, more than entertainment, the hope is that guests can simply enjoy calmness and tranquility. \u201cSometimes, people just want to be left alone, they don\u2019t want to be asked to do activities all the time, and this is the balance that we offer,\u201d the manager explains. One more factor contributes to the facility\u2019s quietness: a restricted age group. The minimum age for check-in is 18, even if accompanied by parents or guardians. \u201cYou can really unwind, and feel away, and relax,\u201d Bakas says. \u201cIt was not an easy decision, but we really wanted to be on a different level [than other resorts in the region].\u201d Fifty shades of white While hoping to leave an impression on the guests, the hotel staff also work hard to remove certain marks. The white walls are kept impeccably white, and there\u2019s a team dedicated to just that. \u201cWe have two painters on site, and their daily job is to go around and do touch-ups,\u201d Bakas reveals. The painters go around the rooms in between check-outs and check-ins, making sure all the surroundings are not gray, beige or eggshell \u2013 just white. \u201cAfter the touch-ups, you need to make sure that the color looks the same, we want to make sure people don\u2019t see different strokes, so really, it\u2019s a crazy big part of our preventive maintenance,\u201d Bakas sighs, as he looks at the walls and ceilings, with a smile.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/anantara-santorini-abu-dhabi-uae/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "travel"}}

The airline is adopting a more cautious approach to turbulence, including not serving hot drinks or meals when the seatbelt sign is on, it said in a statement to Singapore broadcaster Channel News Asia. \u201cSIA will continue to review our processes, as the safety of our passengers and crew is of utmost importance,\u201d it said. The airline did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. The SQ321 London-Singapore flight on a Boeing\u00a0777-300ER plane carrying 211 passengers and 18 crew members diverted to Bangkok for an emergency landing on Tuesday after the plane was buffeted by turbulence that\u00a0flung passengers and crew around\u00a0the cabin, slamming some into the ceiling. The daily London-to-Singapore route SQ321 has completed two flights since the incident and not flown over the part of Myanmar where the sudden turbulence occurred about three hours before scheduled landing. The flight time is about the same, tracking data shows. They flew instead over the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea, route data from flight tracker FlightRadar 24 shows. Photographs from inside the plane showed gashes in the overhead cabin panels, oxygen masks and panels hanging from the ceiling and luggage strewn around. A passenger said some people\u2019s heads had slammed into the lights above the seats and broken the panels. As of late Thursday, May 23, 46 passengers and two crew members were hospitalized in Bangkok; 19 others were still in Bangkok, the airline said. Twenty of the 46 remained in intensive care, an official at Bangkok\u2019s Samitivej Srinakarin Hospital said on Thursday, adding that the injured had a mix of spinal cord, brain and skull injuries. Singapore Airlines, which is widely recognized as one of the world\u2019s leading airlines and is seen as a benchmark for much of the industry, has not had any major incidents in recent years.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/singapore-airlines-turbulence-new-seatbelt-rule-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_married-southwest-pilots", "text": "On their first flight together, Joel Atkinson and Shelley Atkinson couldn\u2019t contain their excitement. They enthused to the flight attendants. They posed for photos. They told passengers via a pre-flight announcement. \u201cWe made a big deal about it,\u201d Joel tells CNN Travel. Then, right before take off, Joel and Shelley sat side by side in the flight deck, just the two of them. They\u2019d come full circle, and were about to embark on an exciting new chapter. \u201cIt felt amazing,\u201d Shelley tells CNN Travel. \u201cAs we prepared to take off, I was giddy, euphoric,\u201d says Joel. Joel and Shelley met as twentysomethings flying jets in the US Air Force. They became fast friends, then, over time, fell in love. Today, they\u2019ve been married for 27 years and counting. They\u2019ve brought up two kids together. And now they\u2019re both pilots for Southwest Airlines. They regularly fly together, with Joel as captain and Shelley as first officer. The couple say working together is \u201camazing.\u201d They treat layovers as \u201cdate nights.\u201d They learn from one another\u2019s respective \u201cwisdom and judgment.\u201d And no, they don\u2019t argue mid-flight. \u201cPeople ask us, how does it work, flying together?\u201d says Joel. \u201cWe know a few pilot couples and some of them fly together, some of them don\u2019t. I\u2019ve heard people say, \u2018Oh I could never fly with my wife or my husband.\u2019\u201d For Joel and Shelley, working together is seamless \u2013 a joy that comes easily to them both. \u201cWe\u2019re best friends,\u201d says Shelley. \u201cThere\u2019s just that unspoken bond,\u201d says Joel. Inspired by \u2018Top Gun\u2019 Shelley grew up in Iowa and moved to Colorado \u2013 Joel\u2019s home state \u2013 as a teenager. The two spent their high school years unaware of one another, but they graduated the same year, and both opted to study at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado in the late 1980s. Joel says he was very influenced by the 1985 Tom Cruise movie \u201cTop Gun\u201d \u2013 \u201cwhich made flying jets look like a lot of fun.\u201d For Shelley, who was an athlete, the appeal of the Air Force Academy was less about flying \u2013 which she only really discovered once she was enrolled \u2013 and more an opportunity to play college basketball. \u201cI didn\u2019t attend the Academy to pursue flying, initially. Once I was there I realized it was a great opportunity for a fun and challenging career,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the introduction to flying there made me want to pursue it further.\u201d Joel and Shelley spent four years studying at the Air Force Academy without actually crossing paths, although Joel was vaguely aware of Shelley. \u201cThere\u2019s not that many women at the Air Force Academy, so I kind of knew who she was,\u201d he says. The two finally met a few years later, after they\u2019d both completed pilot training in different states. They got the same first assignment \u2013 flying Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft in Texas. When Shelley arrived in Texas, Joel had been there for a few months. \u201cSo I was there, kind of established, and she came into the office where I was working,\u201d he recalls. \u201cShe came in and turned in the paperwork, and we said, \u2018Hi,\u2019 just exchanged some pleasantries.\u201d Joel was struck by Shelley right away. \u201cShe\u2019s tall. She looks great. She left the room and this other coworker was just looking at me smiling. And I said, \u2018What?\u2019 And he could tell.\u201d Looking back, Joel thinks it was the \u201ceye contact\u201d he had with Shelley that gave his feelings away. Or maybe just \u201cthe look on my face.\u201d \u201cThere was something there,\u201d says Joel, smiling. \u201cBut I just kind of laughed it off. I was like, \u2018Nah, we\u2019re just going to be friends.\u2019\u201d Joel was also a bit intimidated by Shelley \u2013 he was \u201cattracted to her right away,\u201d but didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d ever be interested in him. \u201cShe\u2019s taller than me. And I had never dated anyone taller than me,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s an athlete, she\u2019s a natural leader, and just an impressive person.\u201d But Joel\u2019s warm nature appealed to Shelley. She felt comfortable around him right away. They became close friends. \u201cJoel has a really great sense of humor,\u201d says Shelley. \u201cI love that about him. And he just really has a sensitive heart to people, all people around him, he looks out for people.\u201d \u201cThat really attracted me to him. And also, he used to have a nice dark head of hair. I really liked that too. But he has a very distinguished look now, and he\u2019s just as handsome as ever.\u201d About a year after they first met, Joel and Shelley were deployed abroad, together. That\u2019s when they \u201ckind of started dating,\u201d as Joel puts it. While there wasn\u2019t much opportunity to go on actual dates on active service, they bonded. \u201cConversations, talking about everything, basically,\u201d says Shelley. \u201cWe really got to know each other\u2019s heart that way. And I think it just made it clear that this is what we were supposed to do.\u201d Back home in the US, the two \u201cstarted officially dating.\u201d \u201cWe just kind of knew that this was going to be it,\u201d says Joel. \u201cAnd within a few months, we got married.\u201d Joel and Shelley became instructor Air Force pilots in Mississippi. Then, in the early 2000s, Shelley gave birth to the couple\u2019s kids, two twins, a boy and a girl. Shelley left flying around this time, but she stayed in the military, working for the US Air National Guard. \u201cI wanted to be at home,\u201d says Shelley. The path to pregnancy wasn\u2019t easy for the couple and Joel calls their kids a \u201chuge blessing.\u201d \u201cWe went through in vitro a couple of times,\u201d he says. \u201cIt took a few years for us to actually get pregnant.\u201d The family relocated back to Colorado and Joel transitioned from military flying to commercial flying, becoming a pilot with Southwest Airlines in 2006. Returning to the air Cut to 2021. The pandemic years were tough going for Joel and Shelley, emotionally speaking. While the couple stayed healthy, their kids were in their late teens and struggled with the upheaval. Plus, Covid was impacting the aviation industry, so Joel was flying less. Around this time, Shelley left her job at the National Guard. She and Joel were wholly focused on their family and their kids\u2019 wellbeing. But in time, the pandemic waned and Joel started flying more regularly. Joel and Shelley\u2019s kids graduated high school and started the next phase of their lives. It was a transitional period for the Atkinson family, and in turn, Shelley started considering her future. She found herself dreaming about flying. She hadn\u2019t been behind the controls of a plane in over two decades, but she felt a call to return. She started wondering if, like Joel, she could become a commercial pilot. When Shelley voiced the idea to Joel, he was immediately enthusiastic. \u201cI said, \u2018Come fly with me,\u2019\u201d says Joel, joking \u201ccue the music.\u201d Then, by coincidence, later that day, Joel saw a social media post from his airline, Southwest, about a pilot who\u2019d taken a two decade break to raise a family, then returned to flying. \u201cShe literally had the same story as me,\u201d says Shelley. It felt like a sign. While Joel didn\u2019t know this other pilot directly, he was able to reach out to her via his work network and pass on contact details to Shelley, who subsequently texted the other pilot, asking for guidance and advice. Then, with encouragement from her new friend \u2013 plus Joel\u2019s wholehearted support \u2013 Shelley committed to returning to the skies full time. While Shelley had years of Air Force experience, she hadn\u2019t flown airplanes for 20 years. She had had to hit the books, take additional tests and ensure her qualifications were up to speed. But before long Shelley was hired by SkyWest Airlines, flying regional jets. Then she joined Joel at Southwest in 2023. \u201cIt was crazy. It happened way faster than I thought it would. It\u2019s been amazing,\u201d says Shelley. \u201cIt was meant to be,\u201d says Joel. Flying together Joel and Shelley credit their success as a co-pilot team to their nearly three decades of marriage, as well as years of co-parenting. \u201cRaising two teenagers during Covid, I tell people that was a lot harder than what we\u2019re doing now,\u201d says Joel. Plus, the two met as colleagues \u2013 so they know how to balance commitment to a job with enjoying each other\u2019s company. Still, as a married couple in the military, Joel and Shelley never flew in the same aircraft. \u201cThe military kind of frowns upon it,\u201d says Joel. \u201cIt\u2019s a little morbid, but they don\u2019t want you to both go down in a plane crash.\u201d No such guidelines exist in commercial aviation, and so once Shelley joined Southwest, she and Joel were able to work side by side. Joel\u2019s seniority allows him to regularly bid for flights with Shelley. And the two find Joel\u2019s years of commercial aviation experience pairs well with Shelley\u2019s fresh take. \u201cShe looks to me and relies on me for the experience that I have. But I also know that she is a very sharp person, she just went through a lot of training. So her knowledge is fresh. And she also has that wisdom and judgment,\u201d says Joel. Since the excitement of their first flight, Joel and Shelley tend not to \u201cmake a big deal\u201d about being a husband and wife pilot duo \u2013 unless it\u2019s preempted by their colleagues. \u201cWe wait for them to ask,\u201d says Shelley. As the couple share the same last name, often crew members put two and two together. As Joel\u2019s the more senior of the two, he often runs the pre-flight briefing. Sometimes he\u2019ll end it with a quick, throwaway: \u201cYes, we\u2019re married.\u201d The crew usually \u201cstart laughing,\u201d says Joel. When Joel and Shelley are taking off and landing, they\u2019re focused on the job at hand. \u201cIt\u2019s very technical,\u201d says Joel. \u201cWe\u2019re running checklists.\u201d But when the airplane reaches cruising altitude, \u201cthere\u2019s some downtime\u201d and Joel and Shelley will make the most of it, talking through their thoughts on life, their kids, their future plans and everything else that\u2019s on their mind. \u201cIt\u2019s so great, because all the years that I was flying, and she was at home, anything I wanted to talk to her about when I\u2019m up in the air, it had to wait,\u201d says Joel. \u201cYou\u2019re saving up conversations until you\u2019re home. It\u2019s like now we\u2019re making up for lost time.\u201d Then, when they land, Joel and Shelley make the most of the layovers. Southwest largely flies domestically, so the couple enjoy traveling the length and breadth of the US together. \u201cIt is a great job, because you go see different places and spend time in different cities,\u201d says Joel, but before Shelley joined Southwest, Joel says layovers sometimes felt like \u201cwasted time, because it was just me, and I couldn\u2019t share it with her.\u201d \u201cBut now we\u2019re together when we\u2019re on the road \u2013 it\u2019s so fun. Because every night on the road, it\u2019s a date night together,\u201d he says. Now, instead of counting the days until he\u2019s home, Joel says his \u201chome is right here\u201d because \u201cshe\u2019s with me.\u201d Family connection While Joel and Shelley have flown together countless times since Shelley joined Southwest, they\u2019ve yet to fly with their kids in tow. That\u2019s on the to-do list \u2013 plus, their son is also training to be a pilot, so there\u2019s a chance Shelley and Joel might pilot an aircraft with him in the future. For Shelley, an additional perk of the last couple of years is her adult kids getting to \u201cview her as a pilot for the first time.\u201d Shelley and Joel\u2019s children grew up knowing their parents met flying jets \u2013 but\u00a0while they saw their father regularly piloting airplanes for Southwest, they never saw Shelley flying. Shelley is really happy her children get to see her doing a job she loves. Shelley\u2019s also proud to be a female pilot in an industry that\u2019s still very male-dominated. She hopes to inspire other people, especially mothers who may have taken a break from the workplace to raise a family, by demonstrating that returning to a passion is possible. \u201cI hope it encourages other women that there is this opportunity out there \u2013 you can come back and you can still do it,\u201d she says. Shelley says she\u2019s really loved rediscovering her love of flying. \u201cThe view from 36,000 feet is pretty awesome,\u201d she says. \u201cFlying over parts of the country - I just love looking down and going, \u2018Oh, what town is that?\u2019\u201d Shelley and Joel particularly enjoy flying in and out of San Diego, California, but they also love it when Southwest takes them to New York. Before Christmas, they enjoyed a stopover in New York City and went searching for the settings of their favorite movies, from \u201cElf\u201d to \u201cSerendipity.\u201d \u201cI love traveling, seeing new places,\u201d says Joel, who adds that he\u2019s gone from avoiding working weekends to voluntarily signing up for Saturday and Sunday flight shifts. He and Shelley now spend Saturday nights watching jazz in Portland, going on hikes in Sacramento or drinking cocktails in Palm Springs. Joel\u2019s always loved flying \u2013 especially what he calls \u201cthe art and science\u201d of aviation. He also loves \u201cserving people, getting them to where they need to be,\u201d but he admits flying during the pandemic was hard going. For Joel, having Shelley now by his side at work has \u201cbeen just a complete turnaround.\u201d Now even the ride to work is fun as the couple car share, coffees in hand. Joel and Shelley, who post about their adventures on their Instagram account @luvpilots, are currently planning to pick up a flight together on Valentine\u2019s Day. Joel bought the two of them heart-printed ties especially \u2013 they\u2019re \u201csilly, but fun,\u201d says Joel. The couple enjoy chronicling their travels on social media \u2013 celebrating their marriage, their respective careers and their adventures. \u201cWe feel blessed. We\u2019re thankful for the opportunity,\u201d says Joel. \u201cWe\u2019re thankful to Southwest Airlines for letting us do this together.\u201d \u201cIf you love doing something, why not do it with the person you love?\u201d says Shelley.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/married-southwest-pilots/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "travel"}}

{"id": "travel_deer-deadly-vehicles-collision", "text": "Retired public relations professional Bonnie Sashin and her husband had just spent a nice Thanksgiving visit and meal with family at her stepson\u2019s suburban home in the Connecticut city of Fairfield, a charming burg of about 61,000 on Long Island Sound. By the time they departed the 2022 family gathering, the sun had already set, Sashin recalls. They cranked up her fairly new Subaru Forester SUV to head to a nearby hotel, where they were staying the night rather than make the two-and-a-half hour drive back to Brookline, Massachusetts, on full stomachs and in full darkness. \u201cAnd just as we turned the corner, practically out of the subdivision where my stepson lives \u2026\u00a0I can feel something hit the car. You know, it\u2019s dark, and I had no idea what could it be. And I was just very alarmed,\u201d Sashin said. \u201cMy husband thought it was some kind of animal, and we of course stopped and fortunately a nice, civic-minded woman in front of us stopped. \u2026 She got out of the car. She saw me. She was really nice. She said, \u2018Oh, that was a deer.\u2019 And she said, \u2018It happens all the time around here.\u2019\u201c The deadly deer problem It turns out that deer-vehicle collisions are far more than a southern Connecticut problem. They\u2019re a problem across much of the United States and in other nations. It also turns out Sashin was fortunate not to have been injured or even killed in the incident. Even people who realize how common deer-vehicle collisions are might be surprised at these startling stats for the United States from this November 2022 study in the journal Cell Biology: \u2022 Around 2.1 million deer-vehicle collisions occur annually. \u2022 The collisions cause more than $10 billion in economic losses annually. \u2022 Each year, they account for some 59,000 human injuries and 440 human deaths. Kip Adams, chief conservation officer with the National Deer Association, notes that deer are much more deadly to Americans each year than those scary movie and TV threats \u2013 sharks, alligators, bears and venomous snakes \u2013 combined. (For instance, there were just two deaths in the United States by shark attack in 2023.) Looks like we should be much more wary of Bambi than of Jaws. And the United States is not alone in having a deer problem. For instance, a 2023 study from Scotland\u2019s nature agency, NatureScot, estimated that 700 people are injured or killed in deer-vehicle collisions in the United Kingdom annually. They grapple with the deer problem in such far-flung places as British Columbia, Japan, Australia and Germany, too. So what can drivers do to protect themselves from unwanted encounters with these herbivores? When time is not on your side Adams says your best shield against a deer collision isn\u2019t a fancy gadget but knowledge. \u201cThe first step in helping to minimize hitting one is to be aware of when they are most active,\u201d he told CNN Travel in a phone interview. \u201cTwo things that play into that. \u2026 One is when they\u2019re most active daily and then also when they are most active annually.\u201d As for the daily factor, sunrise and sunset should be high-alert times for drivers, Adams said. Why is that? \u201cDeer are what\u2019s known as crepuscular \u2013 crepuscular means most active at dawn and dusk,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThe way their eyes are built, they can do the best job avoiding predators and collecting what they need when they move in low-light situations \u2013 that being dusk and that being dawn.\u201d But \u201cthat\u2019s not our peak vision time. So those two things together \u2013 more activity at a time when we can\u2019t see as good \u2013 really play into increased deer-vehicle collisions at those times,\u201d Adams said. Chad Stewart, a deer, elk and moose management specialist with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, concurs. \u201cI would say the hour on either side of both sunrise and sunset are the greatest times when a collision can occur,\u201d he said in an email interview with CNN Travel. \u201cThis is partly due to deer\u2019s activity around that time, but also because of heavy traffic patterns during those hours.\u201d But collisions can occur anytime around the clock, Adams cautions. Keep seasons in mind Collisions can also happen any time of year \u2013 after all, deer don\u2019t hibernate, Adams points out. But two times of year are typically more high risk. Adams said the first one is spring. That\u2019s fawning time, and \u201cdeer are way more active around roads,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen a doe is having her fawn, the does become extremely territorial of those areas. \u2026 What happens is deer get spread out a lot more on the landscape, which means that they\u2019re more apt to, you know, be near a road.\u201d But autumn is the season most fraught with danger, Adams said, \u201cand the majority of that occurs in November. During that time, deer greatly increase their daily movement patterns,\u201d he said, especially the bucks. Research from State Farm insurance company also highlights November as the most likely month of the year to have a collision with an animal. Where to be on high alert As Bonnie Sashin\u2019s collision in a Connecticut suburb illustrates, you don\u2019t have to be out in wilderness to collide with a deer. \u201cTypically, suburban areas can hold higher densities of deer, and with more miles driven by vehicles occurring in these areas compared to rural areas, total number of collisions tends to be highest in these areas,\u201d Stewart cautioned. \u201cBut with that being said, any place has the potential for a collision.\u00a0 Especially where habitat transitions occur (e.g. forest to field), which are commonly used locations for deer.\u201d Adams said be on extra guard where the woods come out close to the road, where \u201cwe have very little opportunity of seeing those deer prior to them being in front of a vehicle.\u201d The suburbs are also a big problem, he said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s extremely difficult to manage deer populations in those areas. We can\u2019t go in there in most cases and hunt like we do in more rural areas.\u201d States with the biggest deer problems Some US states have a bigger problem with deer-vehicle collisions than others. State Farm compiles annual statistics assessing the risk in each state. While the insurance company\u2019s statistics cover all animal-vehicle collisions, deer account for the majority of them. Seventeen states are considered \u201chigh risk\u201d for an animal-vehicle collision, according to the latest State Farm report for 2023-24. Topping the list is West Virginia, where drivers have a 1 in 38 annual risk of being in an animal-involved claim, State Farm says. That\u2019s not surprising to Adams. The Mountain State is filled with forests, has a high deer population and lacks much in the way of dense urban areas. \u201cThey have a lot of winding roads through wooded areas which further reduces the visibility. A lot of factors play together there that definitely put West Virginia at the top,\u201d Adams said. Rounding out the top 5 states are: No. 2: Montana (1 in 53 chance)No. 3: Pennsylvania (1 in 59 chance)No. 4: Michigan (1 in 60 chance)No. 5: Wisconsin (1 in 60 chance) Your best bets to avoid colliding with an animal: Nevada, where State Farm says the chance is just 1 in 770, and Hawaii (1 in 710 chance). Defensive driving Once you\u2019re better aware of when and where the collision risk is highest, then it\u2019s time to put driving strategies into place. \u201cBasic safe driving principles apply to reduce your chance at a collision.\u00a0 First and foremost, avoid distracted driving,\u201d Stewart said.\u00a0Also, slow down in areas known to have high deer numbers so you can \u201chave better reaction should one jump out in front of your vehicle.\u201d Adams said use your high beams whenever possible in deer territory \u2013 but don\u2019t blind oncoming traffic. Stewart\u2019s not sold on gadget remedies. \u201cUsing things like car mounted whistles are not proven to reduce or prevent collisions from occurring, so saving your money and not falling into a false sense of security with these items is advisable.\u201d However, do make good use of your car horn, advises the National Deer Association in this YouTube video. Some other tips from the Michigan State Police: \u2022 Deer typically follow one another in single file, so if you see one deer, there are likely more nearby.\u2022 Look for the reflection of headlights in a deer\u2019s eyes and deer silhouettes on the shoulder of the road.\u2022 Scan the roadside while driving, especially around wooded lots, fencerows, field edges and areas near water. Do. Not. Swerve. Unfortunately, some drivers despite all their caution are going to have to make a split-second decision \u2013 and fight a natural impulse \u2013 when there\u2019s a deer ahead in the road. \u201cWe have a campaign in Michigan called \u2018Don\u2019t veer for deer.\u2019 The reason this phrase is used is because while nobody wants to hit a deer, there can be far worse consequences by swerving to avoid a deer and hitting something else, like a telephone pole or another car,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cSometimes, collisions with deer simply can\u2019t be avoided. But the important thing is to not make it worse for you or somebody else by abruptly and erratically leaving your lane.\u201d Adams dispenses the same advice with a fatherly touch. \u201cI have a 17-year-old daughter. I talk to her about this all the time. Try to avoid the deer but do not swerve because your chances of having a bad accident are much higher,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s way better to hit a deer with the front of your car going straight where that car is built to withstand an impact than it is to swerve and go off the road\u201d and possibly hit a tree or another vehicle, Adams said. The problem with pets and feeding Collisions account for the vast majority of interactions that result in injuries or deaths to people, Adams said, but they aren\u2019t the only ways people can be hurt by these generally docile grazers. Though incidents are very rare, he said deer that have been raised in captivity and have lost their fear of humans can end up hurting the hands that fed them. \u201cYou can find accounts where \u2026 somebody got attacked by a deer, like literally attacked. In almost every case, that was a captive animal that had been hand reared.\u201d Several years ago, a Colorado woman was cited for illegally raising a young deer that attacked and gored one of her neighbors, according to state wildlife officials. In 2023, a Florida man\u2019s pet deer was euthanized on the scene by officials after the animal attacked one of his neighbors. Also in 2023, a man on vacation in Greece approached too closely to a deer for a selfie. The deer rammed him and broke some of his ribs. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission warns people not to feed deer and to treat them with the respect wild creatures deserve. Hunting accidents Hunting is the other time where human-deer interactions can go wrong. In 2019, an experienced Arkansas hunter was found severely injured in the woods, his body riddled with antler puncture wounds from a deer he had shot but had not killed. He later died. Experts say hunters should wait 15 to 30 minutes before approaching a shot deer to make sure it is dead. However, the biggest danger in deer hunting is other people, Adams said. \u201cHunting is very safe, and it has gotten way safer over the past couple of decades with hunter safety programs, but accidents still do happen. And it\u2019s very clear that the most dangerous person in the woods to you, if you\u2019re hunting, is the person you walked in the woods with.\u201d Again, awareness is key, Adams said. \u201cI have a family camp in northern Pennsylvania. We have a lot of friends and family that hunt that we share our land with. \u2026 If we are going out as a group to hunt deer, bear, whatever \u2026 I have a little safety talk and tell everybody, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s be careful today.\u2019 \u201c \u2018I came away lucky\u2019 Bonnie Sashin\u2019s Thanksgiving night collision with a deer happened in a flash. But the repercussions took a while to sort out. The Good Samaritan who stopped in front of her was quite helpful, she said. \u201cFirst thing she said to me \u2013 which was the best piece of advice for us because no one was hurt \u2013 was call the police \u2026 because you\u2019re gonna want a record for your insurance company.\u201d Sashin said she later learned about a friend who collided with a deer and didn\u2019t call the police right away \u2013\u00a0and the adjuster gave her a hard time. The front fender of Sashin\u2019s new car was bashed in, but she and her husband were able to drive her SUV back to Massachusetts, where they learned the vehicle could be repaired vs. being totaled. \u201cI went in to my body shop where I know the guy, his name is Paul. \u2026 He said, \u2018Bonnie, get in line. You know how many cars I have that have been hit by deer in the last week?\u2019 \u201d There were five or six ahead of hers, he told her. \u201cThe pain in the butt part is that you gotta wait a long time these days with a body shop. \u2026 It\u2019s very hard to get parts.\u201d She had to wait until February to get her SUV repaired. Sashin and her husband continue to drive to family trips in the Northeast, but they try to be off the road before dark these days. Despite everything, she\u2019s grateful they weren\u2019t hurt or the vehicle totaled. \u201cI came away lucky.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/deer-deadly-vehicles-collision/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "travel"}}

An adult ticket including an elevator ride to the summit of the Parisian landmark will cost \u20ac35.30 ($38.31) from June 17 onwards, rising from \u20ac29.40 ($31.91), BFMTV reported. The same ticket for children aged between 12 and 14 years old will cost \u20ac17.70 ($19.21) and the price for children between four and 11 years old to reach the tower\u2019s summit will be \u20ac8.90 ($9.66). The price increase has been brought about, BFMTV reported, in part because of a \u201csignificant loss of revenue\u201d caused by the \u201chealth crisis between 2020 and 2022.\u201d In 2020, less than 1.6 million people visited the Eiffel Tower, compared to nearly 6.2 million visitors the year before, the monument\u2019s operating company Soci\u00e9te d\u2019Exploitation de la tour Eiffel (SETE) reported.

{"id": "travel_uk-rock-candy-cheap-imports", "text": "For over 100 years, it has been a staple of the British seaside \u2013 one so classic that one of the best-known novels of the 20th century took its name from it. But rock \u2013 a super-sweet hard candy shaped into long sticks, usually with the name of the resort \u201cwritten\u201d within \u2013 is looking under threat, as local manufacturers say that they are being put out of business by cheap imports. Buying a stick of rock at the seaside has been a typical rite of passage for Brits ever since the candy first swept across the country in a sugary rush, which is thought to have been at the beginning of the 20th century or even a little earlier. By 1938, when author Graham Greene wrote his novel \u201cBrighton Rock\u201d \u2013 which was named after the candy \u2013 he used the snack as a metaphor for morality. Protagonist Ida \u2013 a woman who was pursuing justice against a gang, alone \u2013 says that that people\u2019s characters stay the same throughout their lives, just as the words in a stick of rock run the whole way through. In fact, those famous letters in a piece of rock are handcrafted by artisans, usually in Blackpool, a seaside resort in Lancashire, northwest England. Now the 10 remaining factories in the town say that the industry is at risk, with cheap rock imported from China threatening their business. Their owners have written to the government asking for the UK\u2019s handmade rock to be given protected status \u2013 so that only the candy produced in the country can call itself \u201crock.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very recent problem,\u201d David Thorp, director of Stanton & Novelty Confectioners, one of Blackpool\u2019s 10 rock-makers who wrote the letter, told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been aware of Chinese confectionery and we\u2019ve even sold some ourselves, but it\u2019s been weird and wonderful lollies (lollipops) or marshmallows. But when they started making sticks of rock was when we sat up and needed to do something.\u201d Stanton & Novelty make rock for around 150 seaside towns around the UK \u2013 with each town\u2019s name embedded in the candy. Thorp\u2019s grandfather started the business in 1969. \u201cIt was crazy busy back then \u2013 they couldn\u2019t make enough, didn\u2019t have enough hours in the day.\u201d Now, he says, they have had to diversify their offering, producing lollipops as well as rock, to stay afloat. Fourteen employees work at the factory, as well as Thorp\u2019s parents. His father has worked there for 35 years. When his grandfather started, there were over 30 rock factories in Blackpool alone. But, says Thorp, \u201cEight [factories] have closed in the last two or three years. I\u2019d imagine two more may well close this year.\u201d The UK factories cannot compete on price. \u201cChinese rock is being sold for 12-15p ($0.15-$0.19) per stick, and we\u2019re trying to compete but it\u2019s unsustainable to do so, and becomes economically unviable,\u201d he says. Although Thorp says that Brexit isn\u2019t a direct factor, he says that his cost of ingredients has gone up since the UK left the EU \u2013 as much of the sugar and glucose they use comes from continental Europe. The cost of living crisis in the UK, including soaring energy bills, has made it even harder. Memories of childhood For many Brits, a stick of rock is synonymous with childhood trips to the seaside. \u201cPeople relate it to childhood \u2013 whether that\u2019s their own childhood, or their children\u2019s, or their grandchildren\u2019s,\u201d says Thorp. Of course, most Brits now prefer to hop on a budget airline for some European sun than head to a UK beach \u2013 but Thorp says that even with the change in vacation habits, it was still possible to make a living producing rock. \u201cIf you had a good summer, a nice Easter or a hot half-term holiday, you could always tell,\u201d he says. \u201cI know holidays have changed but it gives people the nostalgia for family holidays.\u201d In Blackpool, making rock is real artisan work. Sugar and glucose are boiled with water, then laid on cold slabs to dry, as coloring is added. While still soft, the different colored batches are \u201cpulled\u201d into strips, and then rolled into large cylinder shapes. Workers compose the letters by hand, using differently colored candy, while the cylinders are still in their original large form \u2013 almost the size of a forearm in diameter. Workers then stretch and compress the cylinders of rock into the inch-thick sticks that go on sale \u2013\u00a0all by hand. It\u2019s a job that requires expertise: at Promotional Candy \u2013 whose owner, Jason Evans, was another of the co-signees of the letter \u2013 the confectioners have a combined 80 years of experience. Thorp says that the imported candy from China doesn\u2019t have the lettering running through the rock, as the expertise is not there yet. But that doesn\u2019t stop distributors and retailers stocking it over more expensive, locally produced candy. \u201cI get quite emotional thinking about [closing down] because we\u2019ve been going for over 55 years,\u201d he says. \u201cThis factory is my family\u2019s identity. It\u2019d be completely heartbreaking.\u201d \u2018We don\u2019t stand a chance\u2019 The business owners who have signed the letter want the government to protect the word \u201crock\u201d or \u201crock stick\u201d in the same way that the UK protects other food and drink: Cornish pasties, Scotch whisky, Wensleydale cheese and Melton Mowbray pork pies can only use these names if they are made in the place they name-check. But rather than keeping it to Blackpool, the rock-makers want candy made anywhere in the UK to qualify, to allow more homegrown producers to take advantage. \u201cThere are very few products that bring up the amount of nostalgia a stick of rock from the seaside does,\u201d says Thorp. \u201cIt\u2019s a sort of national heritage.\u201d Shipping in candy from China also has an environmental cost, he adds. Anita McAleese, owner of McAdams Confectionery and another co-signer of the letter, told CNN that most consumers have no idea that the stick of candy they\u2019re buying has been made in China. \u201cWe don\u2019t really stand a chance if there\u2019s not public awareness,\u201d she says. McAleese\u2019s husband started the business in 1995. \u201cIt was a thriving industry when we started \u2013 there were 18 factories in Blackpool and there was no competition between us because there was enough [business] to go around,\u201d she says. Her 14 employees have slumped to just six since the imported rock started taking hold. \u201ct\u2019s the retailers looking for the cheapest [option],\u201d she says. \u201cI had one distributor who was probably 50% of my work \u2013 and he has gone for the imported rock.\u201d Thorp says that if the homegrown industry goes under, \u201cIt\u2019d be a massive shame.\u201d \u201cSticks of rock are over 100 years old, and a national treasure. It\u2019s part of our shared culture,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll do anything to stop that happening.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/uk-rock-candy-cheap-imports/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_bear-attack-survival-grand-teton-shayne-burke", "text": "Shayne Patrick Burke was looking for owls in the wilds of Wyoming, but he found grizzlies instead. Just moments after Burke noticed a bear cub within 50 to 70 yards, he saw a mother grizzly bear charging toward him. \u201cI stood my ground, shouted and attempted to deploy the bear spray but as I did she already closed the gap,\u201d he wrote in a\u00a0Facebook post about the May 19 incident\u00a0in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming.\u00a0CNN has tried to reach Burke \u2013 whose location is listed as South Hadley, Massachusetts, on social media \u2013 but has not received a response. The\u00a0encounter, which matched details given by the National Park Service about an attack on an unnamed man near Signal Mountain, could easily have ended tragically with a human death, an animal death \u2014\u00a0or both. Burke had been hoping to photograph a Great Grey Owl and was hustling back through the wilderness to meet his wife. With just seconds to react, Burke turned his back as the bear pounced, laid down on his stomach \u201cand braced for the ride\u201d with his hands interlocked behind his neck for protection, the post said. \u201cThe first bite and slash was on my back / right shoulder. I screamed. She then turned, stepping on my back. She bit one of my legs, picking me up and slamming me on the ground multiple times,\u201d the post said. The bear bit each leg about three times, he said. He screamed again with the final bite, which brought the bear\u2019s attention to his head. \u201cI believe she went in for a kill bite on my neck. I still had my hands interlocked and my arms protecting my carotid arteries. I never let go of the bear spray can,\u201d Burke wrote in the post. \u201cAs she bit my hands in the back of my neck, she simultaneously bit the bear spray can and it exploded in her mouth,\u201d he wrote. That\u2019s what saved him from the initial attack, he said. \u201cIt was\u00a0the most violent thing I have ever experienced,\u201d he said in his social media post. \u201cI\u2019ve experienced being shot at, mortared and IED explosions. I am a disabled Veteran in the Army reserve.\u201d \u2018I very well could die\u2019 The National Park Service did not name Burke but confirmed that a 35-year-old man from Massachusetts was attacked on May 19 \u201cas he was hiking through a forested area with diminished visibility.\u201d NPS noted that \u201cthe visitor was carrying bear spray and intentionally making noise based on posted bear safety information from the National Park Service.\u201d The NPS account mirrors Burke\u2019s post: \u201cJust as the larger bear made contact with him, he intentionally fell to the ground on his stomach to attempt to play dead. He interlaced his fingers behind his neck with the bear spray canister caught in one of his fingers,\u201d NPS said via email. The cannister bursting caused the bears to leave the scene, NPS said. According to NPS and Burke\u2019s post, he quickly moved to an area with some cellular coverage. A call to his wife failed, so he texted \u201cattacked.\u201d When she called back, he told her about the encounter as he administered first aid on himself. Photos included with Burke\u2019s post on social media show deep gashes in his hand and back. He noted in his account that he had received advanced first aid training in the army, and\u00a0his wife talked him through treating his wounds with what he had with him. \u201cI cut my back pack straps, camera straps and used my Fanny pack straps\u201d to make improvised tourniquets to control the bleeding. In a later Facebook post, Burke emphasized the role his wife, Chloe, played in summoning help, calming him over the phone and keeping him focused on tending to his wounds and blowing a rescue whistle. Her Facebook profile lists her as an EMT. At 4:02 p.m., Teton Interagency Dispatch Center received notification of the incident, NPS said. With multiple puncture wounds in both legs, Burke knew his situation was perilous. \u201cIn this moment, I accepted on that small hill top that I very well could die,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI recorded a short video telling my people that I loved them.\u201d \u2018Please don\u2019t kill the bear\u2019 Fortunately, help arrived in time. Park rangers were able to locate Burke and administer emergency medical care. He was airlifted to a waiting ambulance and transported to St. John\u2019s Hospital, NPS said. Burke said in his post that he received surgery to clean and staple his wounds. According to the park service, the injured man was released from the hospital on May 20 and is \u201cexpected to make a full recovery.\u201d Park rangers and wildlife biologists investigated the scene the day after the incident. \u201cBased on interviews with the injured visitor and evidence found in the area, it is likely that the mauling involved an adult female grizzly bear with at least one older cub,\u201d the National Park Service said. The specific bears had not been identified. NPS said the bear\u2019s behavior appeared to be \u201ca defensive action,\u201d and that \u201cno further management action is warranted at this time.\u201d That\u2019s an apparent relief to Burke, who said in his post, \u201cthe second thing I said to the park rangers was please don\u2019t kill the bear, she was defending her cub.\u201d \u201cWrong place wrong time,\u201d he said. Bear-country preparation But Burke was prepared. \u201cThe number one thing that kept me alive during the attack was reading and understanding what to do in the event of a bear attack and being prepared with the bear spray,\u201d he said in his post. \u201cThough I am not sure if I got to spray any at the bear, having it on me and keeping it in my hands while protecting my vitals 100% is the only reason I am telling my story now.\u201d The National Park Service shared these tips for backcountry explorers: \u2022 Be alert and aware of your surroundings.\u2022 Make noise, especially in areas with limited visibility or when sound is muffled (e.g., near streams or when it is windy).\u2022 Carry bear spray, know how to use it, and keep it readily accessible.\u2022 Hike in groups of three or more people.\u00a0\u2022 Do not run.

{"id": "travel_article_breakfast-tacos-origins-mexico-texas", "text": "Two simple words can spark mouth-watering bliss or a series of blistering retorts in Texans: Breakfast tacos. In the Lone Star State, who gets the credit for these morning tortilla sensations can be a matter of haba\u00f1ero-hot debate. A highly contested Eater article in 2016 helped start a full-on Breakfast Taco War between Austin and San Antonio. While that particular battle eventually settled down, flare-ups continue. But to get a true picture of this simple food with a complex history, we must go beyond Texas and first look at another place: Mexico. Mouthwatering tacos in Monterrey The breakfast taco is actually part of a long parade of foods (pizza, for instance) whose fuzzy origins and various claims of authenticity spark ferocious debate. There\u2019s one thing we know for darn sure: Today, breakfast tacos are enjoyed on both sides of the Rio Grande River. In her CNN \u201cSearching for Mexico\u201d series, actor Eva Longoria traveled to Monterrey in the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n.     There, she enjoyed a breakfast taco with Mexican food bloggers Gerardo Alvarado and Ernesto Esquivel at Tacos Do\u00f1a Mary La Gritona, which has been serving central Monterrey for nearly 20 years.  \u201cThe breakfast taco may be the simplest of street food, but it\u2019s been been hitting the spot for the workers of Monterrey for nearly a century,\u201d narrates Longoria. \u2018Not a junkie food\u2019   CNN Travel caught up with Esquivel \u2013 born and raised in the border state of Sonora and resident of Monterrey for more than 10 years \u2013 to find out more. \u201cWhen I arrived in Monterrey, I discovered all the different types of tacos that everyone eats in the morning. You can have a taco of eggs. You can have a taco of meat. You can have a taco of potatoes.\u201d Esquivel describes breakfast tacos as \u201ca really fast food, but not a junkie food.\u201d  Esquivel said you can find breakfast tacos in other states in northern Mexico, but Monterrey and the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n are the culinary epicenter with more places to get them and a larger selection of fillings.  Some of the city\u2019s favorites are the machacado (dried beef) with eggs, the barbacoa (slow-cooked meat, often in a pit) and the deshebrada (shredded beef). In other words, you\u2019re in meat country. Timeline of the breakfast taco Esquivel said the breakfast taco goes back to the early 1900s and perhaps even earlier in Monterrey.  Compa\u00f1ia Fundidora, a former iron and steel foundry that dates to 1900 but is now a recreational and educational park, helped the breakfast taco get its start in Monterrey. Employees came \u201cto work really early, and so they had to have a really fast breakfast in the morning, and one fast breakfast in the morning is a breakfast taco.\u201d  And from there, the tacos spread into southern Texas, Esquivel said, which is reflected in the cuisine of today. \u201cI think the flavors here in Monterrey, mostly in the north, are similar to some flavors in Texas.\u201d Along with Do\u00f1a Mary\u2019s, he suggests these spots for a breakfast taco if you\u2019re in Monterrey: Tacos Rafa Ahogados, Tacos Piedra and Tony\u2019s Tacos. North of the Rio Grande   The river may mark a political line between two nations, but it has been no barrier at all to crossings of cuisine and culture. And Texas also shares a passion for the breakfast taco. You can tell that just from all the kerfuffles about them. \u201cNo Texas city can claim the breakfast taco,\u201d says Jos\u00e9 Ralat, the taco editor of Texas Monthly magazine. He places the ultimate credit south of the Rio Grande. \u201cIt comes from Mexico \u2013 where exactly, it\u2019s not really known. Geographically, the most likely source is northern Mexico. There is no literature that I have seen that can point to any particular city in northern Mexico.\u201d As for today, \u201cthey\u2019re popular in [the Mexican states of] Tamaulipas, Nuevo Le\u00f3n and Coahuila, which all border Texas,\u201d he said. Eddie Vega \u2013 who grew up in McAllen, across from the Mexican city of Reynosa in Tamaulipas state \u2013 is known as \u201cTaco Poet of Texas.\u201d He points out that historically, what\u2019s now south Texas was once part of Mexico.  Before 1836, \u201cthe border was further north. All this region was eating a combination of indigenous and Spanish food together.\u201d Vega said that growing up, breakfast tacos weren\u2019t some trendy food to him attracting attention from the likes of The New York Times and other coastal media. \u201cWhen you get to south Texas, and I\u2019m from the Valley, we had breakfast tacos, but they were in my house. My mom would make them. It\u2019s not something we\u2019d go to a restaurant to get because economically that region is very poor and nobody\u2019s eating out. Or not eating out in the morning especially.\u201d Enter Austin Ralat and Vega both said the breakfast taco was staple deep in south Texas and then San Antonio long before Austin got in on the action. So how did Austin become so synonymous with them? Austin has \u201ca great branding mentality, they have a knack for PR. Every year, Austin is flooded with coastal elites checking out South by Southwest,\u201d Ralat said. \u201cThey try some options, and then in their minds, they think it\u2019s an Austin thing. My job is to question the stuff \u2026 and let history speak for itself.\u201d  Ralat said San Antonio has \u201ca bit of an inferiority complex that they\u2019re often overlooked to the benefit of Austin when San Antonio is older, has more culture, it\u2019s more diverse, and the food is better.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, they\u2019re both Tex Mex towns, and breakfast tacos are Tex Mex. But they\u2019re also border food. When the Eater article came out\u201d \u2013 championing Austin as \u201chome\u201d of the breakfast taco \u2013 \u201cSan Antonians lost their minds.\u201d   Vega said the culinary history is too distant for any one place to stamp itself as originator or king purveyor. \u201cI don\u2019t know that one city \u2013 San Antonio, Corpus Christi, McAllen, Brownsville or Laredo \u2013 can claim it. You have differences with them because of ingredients.\u201d Movin\u2019 on Jessica Elizarraras, a Rio Grande Valley native and the executive producer for MySA.com, said many people have put the origins dispute behind them. \u201cI think at this point we\u2019ve mostly moved on from the great taco war of 2016,\u201d Elizarraras said in an email interview with CNN Travel. \u201cIs there occasional ribbing? Absolutely! Are there great tacos across the state? 1000 percent. The Mexican diaspora is far-reaching and so are their tacos.\u201d She cites a 2016 article by Gustavo Arellano as a detailed settlement of the issue that effectively shows Austin is not the start of the breakfast taco.  She also points out the regional differences within Texas. \u201cA flour tortilla in San Antonio tends to lean a bit puffier than its Rio Grande Valley/Coast counterparts. Con Huevos Tacos in San Antonio is the best of both worlds: a thin but sturdy tortilla, filled with fun, flavorful combinations.\u201d They\u2019ve gone nationwide   Ralat said he\u2019s now seeing breakfast tacos coast to coast. He was also recently in Nashville and saw them offered there.  \u201cI hesitate to eat them at a place that calls them Austin-style. \u2026 I want the food to be high quality. I don\u2019t want it to be spin.\u201d  Elizarraras suggests people just enjoy them \u2013 with or without huevos (eggs).  \u201cBreakfast tacos are ephemeral as they come, which makes them that much more magical,\u201d she said. \u201cBean and cheese is a great example of a breakfast taco that doesn\u2019t have eggs. \u2026 Chicharron en salsa (verde or rojo) is another example of a tasty taco that doesn\u2019t require eggs. Barbacoa \u2013 made using a whole cow-head, and more generally, beef cheeks \u2013 is a classic breakfast taco in San Antonio, often paired with Big Red [soda] for a Sunday morning treat.\u201d  The joy of it all In the end, why does the origin of a type of food even matter? \u201cPart of the issue is erasure. Just like with anything else in our Mexican-American culture, to feel left out of a conversation when you know you\u2019ve part of that conversation for a long time.\u201d Vega said. And back south of the Rio Grande, they are a source of unity, Esquivel said.  \u201cI think the breakfast tacos here in Monterrey \u2026 and the northeast of the country is something that unites everyone.\u201d  They\u2019re popular with the poor, the middle class and the rich, he said. \u201cThe place can be ugly. The place can be like in the streets. But you will see people in suits there eating breakfast tacos.\u201d  For Ralat, breakfast tacos are much more than a great way to start the morning. \u201cI think history, especially food history, is important to know because it provides another mirror for our culture. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to me that tortillas are the foundation of Mexican culture, and to break bread with someone is a sacred act. So let\u2019s take it literally, and say that you share tacos with someone else. That\u2019s so nice. And it\u2019s just so joyful.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/article/breakfast-tacos-origins-mexico-texas/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "travel"}}

{"id": "travel_article_how-to-avoid-survive-cobra-bite", "text": "Thailand is full of snakes \u2013 more than 200 species, including cobras. That might be unsettling for some people, but it was ideal for Prangmart Charoenwai as a boy in southern Thailand. He was intrigued by the reptiles. He once captured a nonvenomous sunbeam snake, letting it go days later when he couldn\u2019t feed it properly. He watched online videos to learn techniques in grabbing them, he told CNN. He saw his first cobra when he was about 15 or 16.  \u201cIt was quite big,\u201d Prangmart, now 39, said. \u201cI later saw that snake spread its hood. I stood there watching its behavior. It threatened me, but I felt it was not scary. \u2026 I thought it was beautiful.\u201d His fascination and confidence grew, but his good fortune with cobras didn\u2019t last. In April 2021, the market owner went out on a mission in Trang province in southern Thailand with his rescue group, which responds to routine emergency response tasks, including snake-catching.   Residents in the area said they were concerned about some king cobras. Prangmart arrived at the site with about 15 team members. They didn\u2019t find any cobras the first day, but that changed the next day after some thick brush and overgrown vines were cleared out. \u201cI saw a hole in a big rock where I spotted a snake\u2019s tail, and it looked like it was going into that hole,\u201d Prangmart recalled. \u201cI ran there quickly, and then used a hook to try to get it out.\u201d  But the snake eluded the device.  \u201cDue to my carelessness, because I have been working in this area for too long, I decided to use my bare hand to snatch the cobra\u2019s tail out.\u201d That impulsive grab turned out to be a major miscalculation. Cobras and their world Cobras have an extensive range \u2013 from much of Africa into the Middle East, then into India and the rest of South Asia. From there, they continue into Southeast Asia and Indonesia. That puts them in potential contact with billions of people.  They belong to the elapid family of snakes, which has roughly 300 venomous species. Coral snakes, sea snakes, mambas and kraits are also in this group.  There are about 30 cobra species, according to expert Rom Whitaker, who helped start the Madras Crocodile Bank Trust in India. (Its spinoff, the Irula Snake-catchers Industrial Cooperative Society, supplies the venom used to produce life-saving antivenom to India).   Whitaker said he uses an approximation of the number of species because cobra taxonomy often changes as experts learn more about the snakes. Africa accounts for roughly two-thirds of the species.  Generally, cobras deliver a neurotoxin, which interferes with nerve impulses and can cause paralysis of the heart and lungs. That\u2019s different from that of many vipers, such as rattlesnakes. They generally have a hemotoxin that attacks the blood vessels and causes bleeding and tissue damage. But Nick Brandehoff, who practices emergency medicine and medical toxicology in Colorado and California, said he and other experts are learning that snake venom is more complicated than that simple breakdown. Some elapids have hemotoxic properties, and some vipers have neurotoxic properties. It can vary from snake to snake.  Either way, venomous snakebites are a serious problem in many tropical regions. Only an average of five people die a year of venomous snakebites in the United States, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the World Health Organization estimates around 81,000 to 138,000 people die each year worldwide from snakebites, while about three times that many people live with permanent disabilities. Aggressive or defensive? Despite the high number of deaths and envenomings (bites in which venom is delivered into the body), don\u2019t assume cobras are aggressive. \u201cCobras are shy snakes, and though they make a dramatic show when cornered and alarmed, rearing up, spreading a hood, and hissing loudly, this is stark fear, not aggression,\u201d said Whitaker. \u201cThe snake only wants to be left alone.\u201d Brandehoff, who helps run the Asclepius Snakebite Foundation, added that \u201cthey\u2019re typical of most other snakes in that they don\u2019t want human contact.\u201d And he emphasized cobras don\u2019t chase people.  Kim Gray, curator of herpetology and ichthyology with the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, cited another reason cobras don\u2019t like to bite people. \u201cVenom is valuable to the snake, and it is used to immobilize prey and begin the digestion process, which the snake needs because it eats whole food items and has no limbs to help it in this process,\u201d Gray said.  \u201cSo it does not want to waste its venom by recklessly biting and envenoming all the humans it can encounter.\u201d Biting is a last resort if its typical warning signs to back off don\u2019t work, she said. Are tourists at risk? The vast majority of cobra bites happen to agricultural workers in fields and other locals, often low-income people living in easy-to-enter dwellings and who sleep on the floor, Brandehoff said. \u201cThough people have an idea that the \u2018jungle is full of snakes,\u2019 that\u2019s really not true,\u201d Whitaker added. \u201cCobras are most common in agricultural areas thanks to the proliferation of their favorite prey: rats and mice. \u201cAlert snakes like cobras are frightened of humans and usually flee or freeze when a human approaches. The odds of encountering a cobra on the usual tourist routes in India or Thailand are very slim.\u201d  People staying in hotels with full facilities in a city have less to worry about than those in rural, rustic facilities, Gray said.  If you do find yourself bedding down in a place more likely to attract cobras, she suggested: \u2022 Keep debris away from the shelter\u2022 Clean up food and grains that might attract rats\u2022 Try to keep furniture higher up off the floor and sleep in an elevated bed. Whitaker said it is essential to shine a flashlight when walking at night and not put your hands in thick, bushy spots. What to do if you spot a cobra The experts are unanimous: Leave the snake alone. \u201cMove deliberately and calmly away from the snake \u2013 while keeping an eye on its location if possible,\u201d Gray said. \u201cMove to an open area free of brush and rock outcrops if possible\u201d if you\u2019re outdoors. \u201cDo not try to restrain it, capture it or kill it with a broom or shovel or anything,\u201d she emphasized. Brandehoff concurred. \u201cGive it its space. You are a large mammalian predator to them. They do not want to engage you.\u201d  Whitaker said that bites \u201cusually don\u2019t happen from the strike of a cobra in the hooded posture but \u2026 happen when the snake is stressed by being stepped upon or mistakenly grabbed.\u201d What should you do if you chance on a cobra that\u2019s already really close and seems ready to strike? \u201cMove quickly away,\u201d Gray said. \u201cHuman reaction time is so slow compared to their strike so there may not be much you can do \u2013 but typically the trajectory of the cobra\u2019s bite is forward and downward, and they are not able to change direction mid-strike, so perhaps a sideways rapid move away from the snake may be beneficial.\u201d A serious misstep in capturing a cobra  Prangmart Charoenwai\u2019s impulsive maneuver to grab an escaping cobra cost him.  \u201cThe hole was not deep; the snake made a U-turn out quicker than I thought.\u201d  That\u2019s when it happened. Prangmart got bit on his left thumb. Then he got bit on his right hand. Despite the strikes, Prangmart was determined to capture and bag the cobra himself since he was already bitten \u2013 even though his left hand was already getting numb. \u201cI was told to step aside; I refused. Instead, they told me to stay chilled and urged me to quickly go to the hospital and treat my wound.\u201d They finally bagged the cobra, and Prangmart was able to walk to an ambulance. But his trouble had just started \u2013 the hospital was two hours away.  What to do if you are bitten As Prangmart was learning the hard way, cobra bites are very serious business. But they are by no means a death sentence. \u201cMost snakebites, even cobra bites, are not fatal.\u201d Whitaker said. \u201cBut any snakebite must be treated as a medical emergency. \u201cThe single most important thing to do is to get to a hospital without any delay. Do not resort to any local or home remedy because there is only one cure for a snakebite and that is antivenom.\u201d Gray said that you should try to stay calm and \u201cimmobilize the limb that was bitten, get to the closest hospital without delay (and) make a note of where the bite occurred and the time the bite occurred.\u201d  Also, get a description or photo of the snake if it can be taken safely. This can help doctors with treatment, she said.   Do not tie a tourniquet or try the old \u201ccut and suction\u201d method, Whitaker said, nor should you use a so-called \u201csnakebite kit.\u201d Brandehoff said that if the bite comes from a cobra with strictly neurotoxic venom, people may recommend a crepe wrap, which can help reduce the spread of the venom from a limb to the rest of the body via compression.  \u201cThe problem with that is most people don\u2019t know what kind of snake bit them\u201d and that it\u2019s not reasonable to expect people to readily ID various cobra species.  And if the venom has hemotoxic properties, a wrap can cause more harm than good, damaging tissue around the bite area, he said. Rings and other jewelry should be removed. \u201cThe earlier antivenom can be administered, the better your chances of not having long-term disability or potentially dying,\u201d he said.    Spitting cobras can cause \u201cvenom ophthalmoplegia,\u201d which is basically burning of the eyes, Brandehoff said. Permanent damage can occur but is rarer.   The main treatment is washing the eyes \u201ccopiously,\u201d he said. \u2018I thought I may not make it\u2019 Prangmart\u2019s arrival at the hospital in Thailand did not end his emergency. \u201cAfter I received the serum, I had an allergic reaction,\u201d he said. \u201cI started to have short breaths, rashes. The doctor had to rush back and treated me again. I was watched regularly during that time.\u201d Was he afraid he would die? \u201cThe severe conditions I had to endure at the hospital lasted about two hours. It was when I thought I may not make it. My heart rate was racing, too.\u201d Prangmart pulled through the immediate crisis but then embarked on a 15-day ordeal, bouncing between Western medical doctors and practitioners of Thai traditional medicine to try to save his left hand, where repeated infections threatened to spread.  He eventually got better, but he\u2019s left with a big scar, an important reminder for him and the rest of his team. \u201cAt that time when I saw the snake, I felt excited and I didn\u2019t want it to escape into the hole. Because of that excitement, I hurriedly grabbed the snake. What happened to me, it was my own carelessness.\u201d  And if someone else should encounter a cobra? \u201cKeep calm and watch it; don\u2019t hurry, turn your back and run. \u2026 If you are very scared, start to retreat backward step by step,\u201d he said. \u201cGenerally, these snakes are not likely to attack people first unless there is clear threat to them.\u201d  Why cobras aren\u2019t our enemies Cobras keep the environment in balance. \u201cWithout cobras, the rodent problem in agricultural areas could lead to famine,\u201d Whitaker said. \u201cThese are the most efficient rodent predators in existence, able to enter rat burrows and clean out the entire family.\u201d But he said antivenom efforts must continue. \u201cThose of us who appreciate and respect snakes need to support programs to help reduce the tremendous burden of snakebites affecting tens of millions of rural people in Africa, Asia and South America,\u201d Whitaker said. Brandehoff agreed: \u201cWe can\u2019t attempt to eradicate snakebites like we can malaria. The best thing we can do is try to mitigate snakebites by trying to minimize contacts.\u201d  We need to \u201clearn to live with them. \u2026 In a lot of cultures, there\u2019s a lot of fear of snakes. See a snake, kill a snake; it\u2019s not helpful.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/article/how-to-avoid-survive-cobra-bite/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_worlds-best-barbecue-grill", "text": "Americans are perhaps the standard bearers of the \u201cbarbecue.\u201d Backyards and parks in the United States are full of people gathering around sauce-slathered chicken and other meats. But famed as America\u2019s grill skills may be, many would claim it can\u2019t hold a glowing charcoal ember to the meat-charring culture of, say, Argentina or South Africa. History isn\u2019t clear on where the term \u201cbarbecue\u201d comes from \u2013 one explanation is that it comes from \u201cbarbacoa,\u201d a term used by Spanish explorers to describe the Caribbean\u2019s indigenous Taino people\u2019s cooking technique. In any case, barbecue as we know it today covers multiple cooking methods: On grills, above fire pits, under the ground and in clay ovens. There are regional variations and customs in destinations from South America to Africa to Asia. Read on for further proof that the lip-smacking barbecue experience is a universal tradition, not just an American one. Braai (South Africa) The South African braai (\u201cbarbecue\u201d in Afrikaans) is the nation\u2019s top culinary custom. Here, the frequent gathering of friends and family over grilled, juicy cuts of steak, sausage and chicken sosaties (skewers) cuts through all racial and socioeconomic lines. And no place does \u201cSunday Funday\u201d quite like the townships, where shisa nyama (\u201cburn meat\u201d in Zulu) venues elevate the braai experience with on-site butchers, cooks, drinks and party-starting DJs. Chicago native and model Unique Love spent three years living in Cape Town and fondly recalls her first shisa nyama. \u201cHaving a braai in Cape Town\u2019s Mzoli\u2019s Meat felt like home,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter eating, I never wanted to [leave] because the community\u2019s ambiance felt comforting.\u201d Asado (Argentina) Though its place as the world\u2019s top consumer of beef fluctuates each year, many would claim Argentina will forever be the grande dame of barbecued meats. Like South Africa\u2019s braai culture, Argentina\u2019s affinity for the grill is more entrenched than in the States. Attending a sociable, gut-busting asado (\u201cbarbecue\u201d) on an almost weekly basis is the norm. Though a variety of meats and cuts can be experienced at any gathering, Argentinian Guillermo Pernot, chef-partner of Cuba Libre Restaurant & Rum Bar, insists: \u201cFor the absolute best asado, one should cook a sweet pork and beef sausage, sweetbreads, thigh intestines and blood sausages.\u201d Other asado tips from the two-time winner of the James Beard Award include using coarse salt to coat meats and to have the \u201cindispensable\u201d chimichurri \u2013 a sauce and marinade that usually consists of parsley, garlic, oregano, vinegar and chili flakes \u2013 at the ready. Yaiktori (Japan) Yakitori, a favorite in Japan, consists of diced chicken assembled onto bamboo skewers and cooked over a smoldering layer of charcoal. Yakitori variations are labeled by chicken parts (strips of chicken skin make up \u201ctowikawa\u201d and \u201cnegima\u201d consists of thigh meat with leeks). Its definition has expanded to include any grilled, skewered food, including vegetables, seafood, pork and beef. While there are several ways to enjoy authentic yakitori in Japan, travel blogger Tanya Spaulding shares her tips for maximum enjoyment. \u201cThe best way to savor yakitori is either from a street vendor, or sitting on the floor in your yukata (a sort of summer kimono), cooking your skewers over the shichirin (a small charcoal grill) in the middle of your table,\u201d she claims. Churrasco (Brazil) Barbecue enthusiasts with sizable appetites will love Brazil\u2019s churrasco (Portuguese and Spanish for \u201cbarbecue\u201d). Most visitors to Brazil will get their barbecue fix at a churrascaria, where restaurant servers provide an endless supply of grilled meat cuts directly to patrons\u2019 tables.\u00a0 While Brazilian churrasco might be the most famous, it\u2019s found in several other countries, including Bolivia, Ecuador, Guatemala and Portugal. Dan Clarke, director of RealWorld Holidays, who frequents South America, believes Brazilian barbecues offer more options for vegetarians than neighboring, meat-loving Argentina. \u201cAt an Argentinian asado, you\u2019re really stuck with the salad and fries,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s much better in Brazil because most churrascarias feature salad bars with dozens of kinds of fresh salads, pasta salads, pickles, breads, olives and all the other sides you could wish for.\u201d Lechon (Philippines) Lechon (Spanish for \u201csuckling pig\u201d) features a whole, impaled pig spit-roasted over a charcoal bed or in an oven. Many Filipinos declare the tasty, porky treat to be their national dish although the same claim is made by Puerto Ricans. The lechon cooked on the Filipino island of Cebu is often considered the best in the country, if not the world. Fun fact: Every June 24 in Balayan, Philippines, the locals pay a special, religious-themed homage to roasted pig at the Parada ng Lechon (Parade of Spit-Roast Pig). It involves lechons getting blessed at a church mass followed by a lively parade of floats, music, water guns (for the baptism) and lechons \u201cdressed\u201d in outlandish garments and accessories. Tandoor (India) It\u2019s true: that iconic Indian tandoori chicken you\u2019ve known (and perhaps loved) for ages is considered a barbecue dish. Tandoori food derives its name from the tandoor, the cauldron-like clay oven in which dishes such as naan bread, chicken, seafood and other meats are cooked under high-heat charcoal. \u201cThe art of the tandoor originated centuries ago as a nomadic style of cooking in Central Asia [where] food was cooked on charcoal pits and meat was spit-roasted,\u201d says Manjit Gill, corporate chef for ITC Hotels and an Indian celebrity cook behind several acclaimed restaurants including Bukhara in New Delhi. \u201cThe Tandoori cuisine as we know it today was introduced in the late 1940s in post-partition India, when people discovered that it was a better medium to cook meat in a tandoor rather than on the spit.\u201d Mongolian BBQ (Taiwan) \u201cSurprisingly, despite the name, Taiwan is the origin of Mongolian barbecue,\u201d reveals travel enthusiast and native Taiwanese Erin Yang. \u201c[It] consists of the combination of sliced meat, noodles and vegetables quickly cooked over a flat circular metal surface.\u201d Mongolian barbecue is a relatively new food trend, emerging in Taiwan in the 1950s and influenced by Japanese teppanyaki and Chinese stir-fry. It\u2019s also popular in certain regions of China. Beijing-based food and travel blogger Monica Weintraub says beef and lamb feature heavily in the north of the country. \u201cWhether you\u2019re sharing a leg of lamb between four or five friends or ordering single lamb skewers (yang rou chuan), be expected to intake meat heavily doused in chili powder, cumin seeds and salt,\u201d she says. Lovo (Fiji) Fiji\u2019s barbecue tradition has more of an underground approach compared to other nations. Erin Yang explains: \u201cUnlike many other barbecue styles, Fijian barbecue is cooked in a \u2018lovo,\u2019 an earth oven.\u201d Lovo involves piping-hot stones placed into a large opening in the ground to allow slowly smoked cooking. \u201cIngredients such as pork, chicken, vegetables, taro root and seafood are wrapped in taro or banana leaves and placed onto the stones,\u201d Yang says. \u201cAfter 2-3 hours, the savory lovo will be ready to serve.\u201d Unearthing the pit-smoked food is met with jubilation from feasters, perhaps due to the hours-long wait for the cooking to be completed. Umu (Samoa) Umu, Samoa\u2019s version of the barbecue, is similar to the underground cooking customs of Fijian lovo. Avichai Ben Tzur, a travel writer/entrepreneur who\u2019s spent significant time in the South Pacific, describes barbecue prep work as a family task. \u201cYoung men of the extended Samoan family gather together to prepare the \u2018umu,\u2019 hours before the traditional Sunday feast commences\u2026 catching fresh fish or slaughtering a pig, collecting taro leaves and breadfruit from the family\u2019s agricultural plot and cracking open coconuts for the palusami.\u201d The palusami, a Samoan staple made of coconut cream (often seasoned with onions, lemon juice and simple spices) wrapped in taro leaves, is \u201ca delicious calorie bomb that cannot be resisted by Samoans,\u201d says Tzur. Gogigui (Korean Peninsula) Gogigui (Korean for \u201cmeat roast\u201d) is a favorite of both Koreans and international eaters. Dining at a Korean BBQ usually consists of sliced beef, pork and chicken with an assortment of banchan (side dishes) and rice cooked in the center of a table, which is either cooked by the chefs or the diners themselves. Should you choose to cook your own gogigui, \u201cMasterchef Korea\u201d finalist Diane Sooyeon Kang shares some tips. \u201cFor thin slices of meat like chadolbaegi (thinly sliced beef brisket), you should lie it flat and cook it quickly for a few seconds on each side,\u201d she says. \u201cFor meats like yangnyeom galbi (marinated short ribs), high heat and fire will be best as it will caramelize the outside while keeping the meat juicy inside.\u201d Jessica Mehta, who\u2019s lived in Korea for a year, suggests: \u201cYou\u2019re not really having Korean BBQ if you don\u2019t pair it with soju, a clear liquor somewhat similar to sake.\u201d Pachamanca (Peru) Though Peruvian cuisine is known the world over for ceviche and Pisco sour cocktails, one of Peru\u2019s most traditional Incan cooking customs, pachamanca, is still under the radar to many. Pachamanca (meaning \u201cearth pot\u201d in the Quechua language) involves digging to create a ground oven and lining the cavity with fire-heated stones to cook the food. A variety of potatoes, corn, legumes and marinated meats are enclosed in banana leaves and placed into the earth oven for hours. Authentic pachamanca are served sitting on the ground, and mostly take place on special occasions (especially religious ceremonies) and during harvest time every February and March.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/worlds-best-barbecue-grill/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "travel"}}

When it comes to navigating the flocks of fellow flyers, don\u2019t look for much of an ease-up after Memorial Day weekend. US airlines are predicted to carry 271 million passengers around the world from June 1 to August 31, according to industry trade organization Airlines for America. That\u2019s a 6.3% increase from last summer, and a new record for US airlines. To meet the higher demand, Airlines for America said that US carriers will offer more than 26,000 scheduled flights a day \u2013 up nearly 1,400 a day from summer 2023. While US airlines have staffed up and the TSA says it\u2019s ready for the summer crush, an air traffic controller crunch, hot weather and crowded airports could bring flight disruptions and pain points. Air traffic controller shortage Despite a surge in hiring last year, air\u202ftraffic\u202fcontrol stations nationwide are still about 3,000 controllers short, according to new FAA numbers. The numbers show the challenge of filling the gap that led to flight delays and concerns that fatigue contributed to a series of near collisions on runways last year. The current understaffing means controllers at many facilities are regularly working overtime to cover gaps. The shortage is a concern of\u202fairlines, controllers and watchdogs alike. Scott Keyes, founder of travel site\u00a0Going,\u00a0said that because of the way air traffic control maps are divvied up, airports in New York City metro area and in Florida have a slightly higher chance of being affected by air traffic control issues. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t, you know, not take that trip to New York or to Miami because of air traffic control,\u201d he said in an interview with CNN Travel. People flying in and out of those markets should try to get early morning flights and nonstop flights to help minimize problems if they come up. \u201cI was flying to New York a couple days ago and my flight to New York got delayed by four hours,\u201d Keyes said. \u201cIt was a pain in the butt \u2013 don\u2019t get me wrong. But that just meant I arrived in New York four hours later. \u201cIf I had had a connection in Chicago and my flight was delayed by four hours, I would have missed that connection. And then it\u2019s a much more hairy situation.\u201d Hot weather and hurricanes Much of the United States is looking at varying probabilities of having higher temperatures than the average for summer \u2013 especially in the Northeast and desert Southwest. Extreme heat can do more than make you feel miserable. It also affects airlines\u2019 abilities to carry out normal schedules, according to a report from Embry\u2011Riddle Aeronautical University. \u201cHot air is thin air. While this reduces the lift on which planes rely for takeoff, the main impact is felt on engine thrust. Aircraft engines will produce less thrust during takeoff and ascent as a result,\u201d said Bob Thomas, assistant professor of aeronautical science.\u00a0\u201cThe only way to make a takeoff possible on shorter runways would be to lower the weight of the aircraft.\u201d He said airlines generally reduce weight by removing baggage or passengers, especially as temperatures reach the triple digits. Cancellations are even possible. The report suggested trying to book early morning and late evening flights when you expect to fly in hot weather zones. Experts also warn that as the effects of climate change increase, passengers can expect longer periods of turbulence during flights in coming years. Says one professor of atmospheric science: \u201cThe seat belt sign will be switched on a lot more.\u201d And if you haven\u2019t heard, meteorologists warn we\u2019re phasing out of an El Ni\u00f1o cycle in the equatorial Pacific (with warmer waters) and phasing into a La Ni\u00f1a period (with cooler waters). And La Ni\u00f1a can sometimes generate increased hurricane activity along the US Gulf and Atlantic coasts. In fact, forecasters predict a \u201chyperactive Atlantic hurricane season\u201d with eight to 13 hurricanes. They think four to seven of them could reach at least a strength of Category 3, which have sustained winds of 111 to 129 mph. (The hurricane scale goes up to Category 5, which has sustained winds of 157 mph or more.) Bottom line, especially as summer progresses into peak hurricane season: Keep your eye on the forecasts if you\u2019re scheduled to fly. Crowded airports Passengers will need to pay attention to their ground game this summer, said Keyes. \u201cHere\u2019s how I put it: Airports are going to be extremely full. Airplanes are only gonna be pretty full.\u201d Keyes said new plane deliveries and additional flights will ease the load factor. \u201cThere\u2019s about 10 to 15 percent more capacity this year than there was a year ago. And \u2026 more seats mean there\u2019s going to be more elbow room for folks this summer even during the busy travel season.\u201d That won\u2019t help in the crowded airports, though. He has a couple of tips to mitigate that. First, get TSA PreCheck and/or Fast Track so you can at least bypass possible security line bottlenecks. Secondly, Keyes says he likes to find a quieter, more restful pocket of the airport away from his gate in which to hang out before his flight. He downloads the airline\u2019s mobile app, which notifies him just before boarding is about to start. Silver lining for flyers For those flyers who must carefully consider every dollar they spend, they could find the summer of 2024 to be a less expensive one than last year. Travel site Kayak reports that summer fares should be lower. For US domestic flyers, fares should drop an average of 13% compared with 2023. Mexico is seeing an even bigger drop with fares averaging 16% less. And if Australia is a dream trip of yours, those fares are falling an average of 14% (though the average price is $1,509, Kayak says). For people scared off from Europe last summer by the crowds and high prices, Keyes had some good news. \u201cI think a lot of that pent-up demand [from the pandemic] has been exhausted. I think you\u2019re going to see higher supply, lower demand and cheaper fares to Europe this summer as a result.\u201d Kayak is showing a 7% dip in Europe fares compared with last summer. While hardly typical, Keyes said he\u2019s recently spotted some round-trip mega-bargains that were almost nonexistent last summer: Paris for $570, Iceland for $475 and Dublin for $457.
