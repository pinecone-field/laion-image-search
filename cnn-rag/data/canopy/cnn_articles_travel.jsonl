Junior Geneus Bazile, 29, of Fort Lauderdale has been charged with grand theft in the third degree. The victim was slated to leave the airport on a Spirit Airlines flight the evening of March 3, but the airline canceled the flight and told all passengers they could retrieve their checked luggage on the baggage belt at Terminal 4, the affidavit said. Paola Garcia told CNN affiliate WPLG in Miami that she usually takes her suitcase onboard, but this time, she was told she had to check it. Garcia said waited at least two hours for her pink roller bag, which contained an Apple MacBook, Apple iPad, Apple Watch, jewelry, high-end woman\u2019s clothing and toiletries. It never came out on the luggage belt. In her WPLG interview, Garcia said that Spirit Airlines told her that her luggage had been sent to her house. The luggage never came. But Garcia explored another avenue with her own electronic tracker. Garcia, not named in the affidavit, later pinged the electronic items inside the bag to try and locate them, and the ping showed them at an address in Fort Lauderdale, the affidavit said. Tracking down her luggage She then went to retrieve her things from the address, but she couldn\u2019t contact anyone inside the home, the affidavit said. While at the house, she took video and still pictures, where she saw \u201cseveral pieces of luggage in the front of the home,\u201d none of which were her own, the affidavit said. Garcia told WPLG that she dialed 911. \u201cThe first thing I remember the police told me is: \u2018What are you doing here? This is so dangerous for you to be here.\u2019 \u201c When a detective with the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office searched the address within the airport\u2019s employee databases, he found that Bazile reportedly lived at the address. Bazile was listed as working at a Paradies Lagard\u00e8re Travel Retail store at the airport and was working on the day of the theft, according to the affidavit. The store\u2019s loss prevention manager was contacted, and he provided the detective with internal CCTV footage from the day of the incident, which allegedly showed Bazile entering the store\u2019s storage room with a pink shell roller bag, matching the description of the stolen bag, and rummaging through the luggage, the affidavit said. \u00a0He then appeared to take the MacBook and other smaller items out of the luggage and put\u00a0them in other bags. A WPLG video shows pictures of a man holding a plastic bag containing a pink suitcase and holding a laptop. \u201cParadies Lagard\u00e8re takes this matter very seriously. Immediately upon learning of the incident, this employee was terminated. As this is an ongoing police matter, we have cooperated with the investigation and recommend reaching out to the Fort Lauderdale Police Department for more information,\u201d the company told CNN on Wednesday afternoon. After being charged with grand theft in the third degree, Belize pleaded not guilty and posted $30,000 bond. His next court date is scheduled for August 23, court records show. CNN has reached out to Bazile and his public defender for comment. In a statement, Spirit Airlines told CNN that even though they are \u201cnot aware of any evidence that any Spirit employee was involved,\u201d the airline issued a reimbursement check to the woman whose luggage was stolen, \u201cas a courtesy.\u201d CNN\u2019s Melissa Alonso contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/airline-passenger-tracks-missing-bag-felony-theft/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_article_how-to-survive-alligator-attack", "text": "Jeffrey Heim woke up on May 30, 2021, with one thing on his mind: Sharks.  Specifically, shark teeth. They\u2019re his passion and his business. An unsuccessful attempt the day before to find any of them only fueled his obsession to find some on his next outing, he told CNN Travel recently. So on a hot, sunny Sunday in Sarasota County, Florida, the 25-year-old Heim proceeded to the Myakka River on a spot about 45 minutes from the Gulf of Mexico. He had been there numerous times and was comfortable with plunging into its murky waters to find the teeth of extinct megalodons in the riverbed. He put on his wetsuit, mask, fins and snorkel and entered the water from the shore, not far from a restaurant along the riverbank.  Heim slipped beneath the surface. He was under no more than one minute when he felt something. Something bad. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything, didn\u2019t see anything. I just felt like a blunt force object \u2013 like someone \u2026 swinging a baseball bat and just whacking my head. But mostly what I felt was what I thought was a huge boat just slamming into me and just pulling me down.\u201d To his shock, it wasn\u2019t a boat.  He was in the water, alone and face-to-face with an alligator.  Gator attacks: Rare but fascinating   Heim was in a situation many people probably fear but very few actually experience: an attack by an alligator. An estimated 5 million wild American alligators are spread out across 10 states in Southeast and beyond, including parts of North Carolina and even the extreme southeastern tip of Oklahoma. Louisiana has an estimated 2 million wild gators in a state of about 4.65 million people. Florida sports roughly 1.25 million alligators (and more than 1,000 American crocodiles). Georgia has about a quarter of a million. Some of these gators inhabit places where lots of people live and many others vacation, such as lakes and rivers all across Florida and coastal South Carolina. Yet gator attacks aren\u2019t that frequent and deaths even more infrequent (deadly attacks from dogs and horses and other mammals are more common). There were 442 unprovoked bite incidents in Florida from 1948 to 2021, and 26 of these bites resulted in people dying, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conversation Commission. It turns out gators, in natural conditions, simply aren\u2019t that interested in people, according to Kimberly Andrews, a gator and snake expert with a doctorate in ecology from University of Georgia\u2019s Marine Extension and Georgia Sea Grant and who manages its Coastal Ecology Lab.  \u201cWe are not their prey. If you think about it, we\u2019re quite dangerous to attack. We\u2019ve got arms and legs. We can stand upright. We can walk, we can swim. \u2026 We\u2019re not a good animal to pick a fight with.\u201d \u201cUnless they\u2019re confronted, they\u2019re going to stay on their own turf.\u201d Nonetheless, people continue to be fascinated by such possible encounters. Overblown reputation     Andrews wants to dispel the notion of gators as aggressive, ravenous menaces on the move. \u201cThey\u2019re called ambush predators. We also call these \u2018sit-and-wait\u2019 predators,\u201d she said.  They\u2019re large, so it\u2019s \u201cenergetically costly for them to be really active. \u2026 We would be considered an active forager. We go out and find our food.\u201d Not so with gators. \u201cWhen you come down to it, they\u2019re not that maneuverable. Large body. Small legs. And this also plays into why the perception of their danger is exaggerated from the actuality.\u201d  Nonetheless, caution is advised when you\u2019re in gator territory, be that at golf courses, swamps, lakes, rivers and hiking and bike trails and fishing spots along waterways. Best defense: Avoid an attack  Education is key to avoiding a bad encounter, Andrews said. Start with knowing when gators are most active. Courtship season starts as spring warms up; mating extends in early summer; and in Okefenokee Swamp in southeastern Georgia, \u201cwe start to see eggs hatch out starting in September and October. \u2026 And that\u2019s when the females are most protective when they feel someone is threatening their babies,\u201d Andrews said. Your best season is winter: If it\u2019s cold, \u201cthey\u2019re not doing whole lot.\u201d When temperatures start settling into the 80s (27 Celsius), gators become mostly nocturnal. So it\u2019s best to avoid that refreshing night dip in unknown waters when it\u2019s hot. Don\u2019t provoke, don\u2019t feed, don\u2019t panic   Unprovoked attacks are rare, Andrews said. People are usually the provocateurs, not the gators. Gators can be disturbed or confused when folks have been known to try to grab them by their tails or go in for close-up photos of sunning gators Even worse, people will feed them. Then the reptiles start to associate humans with food. That\u2019s when gators can be most dangerous \u2013 when they\u2019ve lost their natural fear or disinterest in people. \u201cThey\u2019re more likely to take the easy way out and get our food than to do the work to fight for it,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cIn areas where we have high rates of tourism but not a lot of education and oversight of how people are interacting with alligators, we see feeding issues.\u201d  If you do have a gator encounter, she suggests staying calm and respecting its territory  \u201cSay you\u2019re kayaking, and you see an alligator, just keep going past it. Give it a wide berth, as much as the space will allow,\u201d Andrews said.  \u201cDon\u2019t take the paddles and slap the water. Sometimes people do that to scare the alligator off,\u201d but you\u2019re actually indicating you\u2019re a direct threat.  \u201cIf for some reason they start to swim toward you \u2026 usually try to go in the other direction and just show you\u2019re not interested. Or paddle right on by and ignore the animal.\u201d Also, never mess with the reptiles\u2019 children. \u201cWe always tell people that those one-foot baby alligators, even though they\u2019re so cute, they\u2019re the most dangerous sized alligator to mess with.\u201d That\u2019s because there\u2019s possibly a nearby mother ready to protect her young. More ways to avoid an attack   Authoritative websites have plenty of good advice to avoid a dangerous encounter. From the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory at the University of Georgia: \u2022 Don\u2019t feed ducks, turtles or other animals that share waters with alligators.  \u2022 Stay about 60 feet (18 meters) or more away from an adult alligator. If an alligator hisses or lunges at you, you are too close. \u2022 If you\u2019re driving, let an alligator cross the road. They move across roadways the most often in spring and summer.  \u2022 Supervise pets and children when you\u2019re in gator territory. \u201cLarge alligators do not recognize the difference between domestic pets and wild food sources,\u201d the SREL says. \u2022 Avoid heavy vegetation in and near the water\u2019s edge.  The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission also advises: \u2022 Never swim outside of posted areas, and swim only during daylight hours. Alligators are most active between dusk and dawn. \u2022 Get rid of fish scraps in garbage cans at boat ramps and fish camps; don\u2019t toss them in the water. Experts also advise people to call local or state authorities if you see alligators roaming around neighbors and other places you wouldn\u2019t expect. Do not try to handle the reptiles yourself. As for Jeffrey Heim, these tips were more than theory. Mission: Survival   Heim was in serious trouble, and he knew it. The gator had already bit him in the skull and on the hand. And it was coming toward him again. The gator \u201cpulled my mask off and pulled my head down towards my stomach. And then I come up, head above water. I no longer have the mask with the GoPro that\u2019s filming. And we\u2019re both looking at each other, and we both sit there for about two or three seconds, and I feel my head.\u201d  He wasn\u2019t sure what he was feeling at the time, but he learned later it was his scalp, partially torn off his skull and flapping in the water. Then \u201cshe lunges at me and I back away calmly \u2026  like I would with my experience with sharks, you don\u2019t want to act like prey. So I just backed away to keep my space.\u201d \u201cAnd then she really aggressively lunged at me \u2026\u201d  What to do if you\u2019re attacked   Heaven forbid you\u2019re that person like Heim who is being attacked by an alligator. Would you know what to do? If the gator is trying to drag you under the water, \u201cyou have to assume at this point you\u2019re fighting for your life, and you\u2019ve got to give it all you\u2019ve got,\u201d Andrews said.  \u201cWe recommend trying to poke them in the eye, hitting them in the top part of the skull or the side of the jaw. Those points are sensitive on alligators just like they are on us,\u201d she said. In a water attack, the danger is more from drowning than the bite, Andrews said. So get to land if possible. \u201cWe\u2019re better on land than they are. They\u2019re better in the water.\u201d But don\u2019t assume all is safe if you\u2019re on land. And the alligator has more in its arsenal that a fearsome set of teeth.  You can be injured if you\u2019re hit by the tail. Gators can also whip around with their skull and use it like a battering ram. Andrews knows first-hand how dangerous that can be.   She was part of a capture team once that had a gator taped up and its mouth secured when it unexpectedly whipped its head around.  \u201cIt actually hit me broad with the side of its head across my shins \u2026 and I blacked out. And I wondered, \u2018Oh my gosh, did I fracture my shin bone?\u2019 I had a lump the size of a tennis ball. It is amazing how muscular and powerful they are,\u201d Andrews recalled. The gator uses its mouth. Use yours. \u201cScream, make as much noise [as you can], not only fight back but make yourself as big and as much a pain in the rear end as you possibly can.\u201d If people are nearby, they should call 911 for help, Andrews said. If a pole is nearby, someone can beat on the gator and give it another target.  \u201cAnother person in an attempt to rescue you should never come in the water after you and the alligator. They can help you most by being on the ground and helping you get to the ground,\u201d Andrews said.  Other ways to fend off an attack   Here are some more survival tips from various wildlife departments and other experts: \u2022 If you can escape on land, run away in a straight line. Experts debunk the advice to zig-zag. Gators can move really fast on land, but only in short bursts and distances before they tire out. \u2022 Try to cause a gag reflex by jamming any objects you can reach into the back of the alligator\u2019s mouth. \u2022 Sometimes a gator will reposition its prey in its mouth. With its jaw back open, that is your chance to escape. \u2022 \u201cAlligators clamp down with powerful jaws, then twist and roll. If an alligator bites your arm, it may help to grab the alligator and roll with it to reduce tearing of the arm,\u201d according to advice from the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources. \u2022 Get immediate medical attention if bitten. Alligator bites often result in serious infection.   All of this is specific to American alligators, Andrews emphasizes.  Other crocodilian species in places such as Africa and Australia can be more aggressive. We\u2019re actually prey-sized for some of these, she said.  But the relatively few crocodiles in southern Florida aren\u2019t known for attacking people. The escape   One of Andrews\u2019 survival tips came in very hand handy as the female gator lunged yet again at Heim. \u201cI really backed away. Got out of that river as quickly as I could. I climbed out of the six-foot bank and stumbled over to the parking lot.\u201d He was about to pass out, but he was able \u201cto yell over to some people over at that restaurant.\u201d Fortunately, they heard his cries for help and were able to assist him with a first aid kit from the restaurant and call 911. While waiting for the paramedics, he wasn\u2019t in pain. But \u201cthe whole time I\u2019m sitting down just super loopy and exhausted. That\u2019s when I thought I was going to die.\u201d He ended up in the ICU in a hospital for two days but was back at work the next week \u201cwith staples in my head.\u201d  Lessons learned   Heim has now had time to reflect on what he did that day and on what others can learn from his attack. \u201cI knew there were gators there. This day, I basically did everything wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cI was aware it was gator mating season, but I went to the river with too much confidence, especially being alone, and free diving, which I had never done in that river before.\u201d \u201cThat cockiness, or confidence, led to the bite, honestly, even though this was an uncharacteristically aggressive alligator apparently. It was still the wrong time of year to go.\u201d  Like other young people who have spent time in the watery wilds in the Southeast, he was lulled into a false sense of security because he had been around gators before with no ill results. \u201cI was casually looking around for gators, but if I had even seen one, I had dove with them before and it hadn\u2019t caused an issue.\u201d \u201cI think the difference was this was near a restaurant, and fed gators are the most aggressive gators. So that\u2019s what the gator professionals believe contributed to this attack, too,\u201d Heim said.   \u201cIf you\u2019re going to dive in a river like that, which I don\u2019t suggest anymore, don\u2019t free dive. You\u2019re going to go up and down like their prey. And you\u2019re going to look much smaller that you actually are.\u201d \u201cWeigh all risks. Anything can happen at anytime to anyone. None of us are invincible. And I think it was the youth in me being a little too confident.\u201d  Heim has been chastened, but not chased off. He continues to search for shark teeth and has ramped up operations for his business, SHRKco. His approach is different now. He\u2019s more cautious. He said he has more and better equipment. He\u2019s even been diving back in the Myakka twice since the attack. However, he now goes with other people, including gator experts.  Andrews said it\u2019s crucial for people to co-exist with alligators because they\u2019re an Indispensable part of the ecology as an apex predator keeping populations of other animals in check. \u201cIn the South, they\u2019re part of our heritage. What a charismatic and iconic feature of our landscapes. It should be: We like our sweet tea. We like our grits. We like our alligators. This is part of who we are.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/article/how-to-survive-alligator-attack/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_new-beaches-open-paris-olympic-games", "text": "Lying on a sunny beach in France, occasionally sipping an ice-cold beverage, and then jumping into warm water. This must be the French Riviera, right? Or, actually, Paris. In an effort to transform how tourists experience summer in the French capital this July and August as it hosts the 2024 Olympic Games, the city is opening three beaches in its center, bringing a taste of St. Tropez and Nice to more northerly, urban shores. As usual, Paris will open its regular summer beach on the banks of the Seine river. But this year, it\u2019ll be joined by two more along the Saint Martin canal \u2013 a return of a regular fixture in the Bassin de la Villette cultural district plus a newer plage further along. Paris\u2019 city government confirmed to CNN it is confident that the water quality will meet health standards during the game. Pierre Rabadan, Paris deputy mayor in charge of sport and the Olympic games, said the city will deploy 30 testing sites along the Seine and its branches before it reaches Paris to monitor water quality in real time and quickly identify and handle potential pollution risks. For those who still might recoil at the idea of jumping in a city center waterway, there are other options. The beaches are the centerpieces of a program of activities in Paris aimed at creating an Olympic festival for visitors descending on the city during the 2024 summer Games. This has been revealed as Paris, traditionally one of the world\u2019s most popular tourist destinations, faces a potential struggle to lure visitors amid fears of overcrowding and overpricing during the Olympics. An alternative Paris Olympics, for everybody The 2 million-plus residents of central Paris have always had a strong sense of pride in the arrondissement, or district, that they live in. It\u2019s not unknown for residents of the 16th arrondissement and those of the 11th arrondissement to harbor subtle prejudices against each other. The city is planning to harness those rivalries in a \u201cDistrict Olympics\u201d that will pit the fastest, highest and strongest from each arrondisment to finally settle the debate of which neighborhood is best \u2013- at least in terms of sport. But these games are actually open to everybody aged seven and above. Which means you don\u2019t need to live in Paris to participate. All you need to do is pick an arrondissement you\u2019d like to represent. Participants will be separated into four age groups: 7 to 12, 13 to 16, 17 to 35 and those aged 36 or above. From June 22 to July 13, Parisians and visitors can compete in seven different sports: laser run (cross-country running combined with laser pistol shooting), 3x3 basketball, boccia (a Paralympic ball sport) table tennis, 60-meter run, breakdancing, and\u00a050-meter freestyle swimming. Olympic flames For those who just want to party and watch other people, professional or amateur, do the sport, Paris has you covered. The arrival of the Olympic flame to the French capital coincides with France\u2019s July 14 national day \u2013 and the city is throwing a huge party to celebrate. On the day, Parisians and visitors will be able to watch the torch relay at several city center locations. In Place du Colonel Fabien it\u2019ll be soundtracked by a DJ and at Petit Palais, right by the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. French opera group D.I.V.A will provide the music. In the Paris LGBTQ district of Marais, a bingo drag event is being organized for the viewing party. For those who miss the flames in Paris on July 14 and 15, the torch returns to the French capital for the opening ceremony on July 26. This time the flame will journey down the Saint Martin canal to the opening ceremony on the Seine river, offering the potential of watching it from one of the new beaches. A marathon for all For runners, Paris is offering the chance to run the exact Olympic marathon route between the city center and suburban Versailles \u2013 said to be the first such event in the history of the Games. The event will take place on August 10, with an additional 10-kilometer route for less ambitious participants that will take runners past landmarks such as the Op\u00e9ra Garnier, Place de la Concorde and the Eiffel Tower. The full-length marathon is open to those aged 20 above while the shorter version is open to anyone aged 16 and above. Entry is via a lottery through the Paris Olympic Games app.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/new-beaches-open-paris-olympic-games/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_article_chance-encounters-florence-italy-kacie-rose", "text": "Kacie Rose Burns walked into the Florence jazz bar, alone. \u201cI\u2019ll go for one song and suss it out,\u201d she thought, trying to quieten her nerves. Kacie slipped in at the back. The club was dark and busy, a few wall lights and neon signs illuminating people drinking, dancing and chatting. Before she could even take in the musicians on stage, Kacie\u2019s eyes landed on a tall man sitting at the bar. \u201cI walked in and he was there,\u201d Kacie tells CNN Travel today. \u201cWe clocked eyes.\u201d \u201cCiao,\u201d said the stranger, smiling. \u201cCiao,\u201d Kacie said back, before adding apologetically: \u201cThat\u2019s all the Italian I\u2019ve got for you.\u201d It was October 2018. Kacie was a 24-year-old New Yorker on vacation in Florence. It was her first time in Italy and her first time traveling solo. It was an exciting \u2013 and terrifying \u2013 experience. \u201cI was a professional dancer in New York,\u201d explains Kacie. \u201cA very exhausting career \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of toxicity, a lot of rejection, there\u2019s a lot of politics that come into play \u2013 and I was feeling a little stuck, a little unhappy, a little \u2013 just stagnant, if you will.\u201d Kacie spent her days auditioning, traveling for gigs and moonlighting at a clothing store. She needed a break, and she\u2019d long felt a \u201cpull\u201d to Italy and dreamed of an Italian vacation. \u201cI kept saying, \u2018I\u2019ll wait for somebody to go with, I\u2019ll wait, I\u2019ll wait. And then I was waiting for years. And so then one night \u2013 at two in the morning \u2013 I was like, \u2018What am I waiting for? Life is too short.\u2019 So I booked a solo trip to Italy.\u201d Kacie planned to spend the majority of her time in Rome and Venice and just a couple of days in Florence. But in the lead-up to the trip, she got chatting to a customer at the store she worked at. This woman had lived in Florence for five years and sung the Tuscan city\u2019s praises, persuading Kacie to add an extra day to her Florence stint. And that\u2019s how Kacie and the Italian stranger happened to be in the jazz club on the same evening. \u201cI\u2019m really glad that I listened to her,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cThat\u2019s the only reason why we met on the first night that I was in Florence, on that earlier day that I wasn\u2019t originally supposed to be there.\u201d A Florence meeting The man Kacie crossed paths with in the jazz bar was 26-year-old Dario Nencetti, a chef in a Florence hotel who usually worked nights. It just so happened that was the only evening he had off that week. The jazz bar, called Jazz Club Firenze, was one of Dario\u2019s favorite hangouts. He loved the music, the underground ambiance and the fact the bar encouraged punters to sign up for jam sessions. \u201cThat place is, let\u2019s say, unconventional for Florence,\u201d Dario tells CNN Travel. \u201cUsually in Florence, there\u2019s like a table for two or three or four people. In the jazz club, there are big tables, so you can sit with strangers and stuff, which I love.\u201d When Dario realized Kacie didn\u2019t know much Italian beyond \u201cciao,\u201d they switched to English. Dario told Kacie he\u2019d lived in Scotland for a year, and they got talking about travel. Kacie mentioned she was on her first solo trip and Dario said he\u2019d embarked on a similar adventure to Japan earlier that year. \u201cWe bonded from the beginning,\u201d says Dario. \u201cIt was really natural, really easy conversation.\u201d \u201cI remember he made me laugh,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Oh, this guy\u2019s interesting.\u201d So many people ask us, \u2018How did you know?\u2019 And I don\u2019t know how I knew. I was just like, \u2018Oh, this is something different.\u2019\u201d Kacie and Dario stayed at the jazz bar talking into the early hours of the morning. Then they spent as much time as possible together over the next two days. \u201cHe would meet me after his work \u2013 every night he got off at 11. And we would go out and we would just talk,\u201d recalls Kacie. \u201cI instantly fell in love with Florence. It\u2019s a very romantic city - cobblestone streets and medieval buildings. It looks like a painting everywhere you look.\u201d It was a whirlwind two days. One evening they sat by Florence\u2019s Ponte Vecchio bridge and talked until 3 or 4 a.m. It was as though Kacie was in a film \u2013 somewhere between every millennial\u2019s favorite \u201cThe Lizzie McGuire Movie\u201d and classic Florentine romance \u201cA Room with a View.\u201d Then, the two days were up and Kacie had to continue onto the next leg of her trip. It was still like something from a movie \u2013 only it wasn\u2019t obvious this one had a happy ending. \u201cI got on the train and he was standing on the platform. And I remember looking out the train, and I was so sad,\u201d she says. As the train pulled away from the station, Kacie wiped away tears and messaged her best friend back home in New York. \u201cI just met my future husband in Florence,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s the guy I\u2019m gonna marry. I\u2019m never gonna see him again.\u201d Her friend tried to cheer her up. \u201cYou\u2019re going to Rome,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYou\u2019ll meet a gladiator!\u201d But Kacie knew what she had with Dario wasn\u2019t replaceable. \u201cWe never stopped talking. We FaceTimed every single day,\u201d she says. This continued when Kacie was back in the US. And before long, Dario was planning a trip to visit New York. A New York minute On December 8, 2018 Dario arrived in the US. Kacie spent a week introducing Dario to her life in New York. \u201cIt was really cool to see it through his eyes,\u201d she says. \u201cShe showed me the real city,\u201d says Dario. Then the couple flew to Miami for a week\u2019s vacation. For Kacie and Dario, there was never a specific moment where they decided to embark on a relationship. \u201cIt was never a decision to be made,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cIt just went without saying,\u201d agrees Dario. \u201cBut I can\u2019t hide it, long distance was hard.\u201d The two struggled with time zones and their busy jobs that left them with little downtime, but tried to visit each other whenever they could. Cut to September 2019. Dario was back in New York visiting Kacie. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I move here?\u201d he suggested. He\u2019d loved the vibrancy of the city from the get-go and could see himself there. The restaurant scene was incredible. If he could find a job and organize the visa, it seemed like the ideal scenario. Kacie thought so too, so Dario started asking around. He was eventually hired as a chef at an Italian restaurant in Brooklyn. After a couple of months in limbo, his visa was approved. \u201cUp until that point, every time that we had to say goodbye it was borderline traumatic \u2013 we had spent this week together and we knew that this was it for each other,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cSaying goodbye in airports sucked. It would take like a week to recover.\u201d But now the airport goodbyes were consigned to the past. \u201cIt was really exciting,\u201d says Dario. Moving forward together Kacie and Dario spent three months in New York together, giddy with happiness to be in the same country and the same city. Then the pandemic hit. New York City\u2019s performing arts and restaurant industries ground to a halt. Stuck at home, Kacie and Dario found solace and support in one another. As Kacie puts it, she and Dario found \u201cmany silver linings\u201d in this tough time. Dario taught Kacie how to make pasta. They cat-sat. They spent long evenings chatting. But as 2020 rolled on, the couple were aware there was a deadline hanging over them. Dario\u2019s visa was set to run out in December and in the wake of the pandemic, renewal was out of the question. For Kacie and Dario, it seemed like there were only three viable choices: return to long distance, get married or move to Italy. Going back to long distance would mean the return of those airport goodbyes, the last thing either of them wanted. And while Kacie and Dario thought marriage was in their future, they didn\u2019t feel it was right for them at that point. That left moving to Italy. Kacie thought about her career in New York. Performing was off the table and there was no return date in sight. And while her friends were regularly posting on social media about how much they missed dancing, Kacie only felt \u201crelief\u201d that her days were no longer defined by auditioning and uncertainty. \u201cThat was a pretty big wake-up call,\u201d she says. \u201cI had gotten to a point where I needed to take a little step back from performing.\u201d On top of this, Kacie\u2019s New York apartment lease was up. If there was ever a time to relocate to Italy, it was now. \u201cEverything kind of fell into place,\u201d she says. Kacie researched online and found a language academy in Florence offering study visas. She applied, enrolling in Italian lessons. Then, Kacie and Dario packed up their life in New York and got ready to move across the Atlantic. Before stepping on the plane in January 2021, Kacie posted a video to TikTok about meeting Dario and the move to Italy. She\u2019d never posted much on the platform before, but felt inspired to mark this significant life step. When she stepped off the plane and connected to Wi-Fi, her cell phone was blowing up. \u201cIt went viral,\u201d says Kacie. While stuck inside during mandatory two-week quarantine, Kacie continued posting TikTok videos. Her following continued to grow. While her social media presence was getting bigger, for the first few months in Florence, Kacie and Dario\u2019s IRL world remained small. Italy was still in the thrall of Covid, with strict restrictions. But as Kacie studied for her Italian lessons and taught English online and Dario looked for restaurant work, Florence started to slowly reopen. \u201cI remember the first time going to the Duomo. And there was nobody there,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cWhich is crazy, because it\u2019s like the main focus point of Florence. And there\u2019s nobody in the piazza and I remember how bizarre that was.\u201d While that moment was surreal \u2013 even sad \u2013 Kacie and Dario still felt grateful to be at the Florentine landmark together. They\u2019d come a long way, and they were excited for their new life together in Italy. Acclimatizing to Italian life was made easier for Kacie by Dario\u2019s family, who welcomed her wholeheartedly \u2013 even if, in the early days, Kacie struggled with Italian and Dario\u2019s mother didn\u2019t know much English. The two women made communication work by using Google Translate on their cell phones. \u201cThey bonded immediately,\u201d says Dario. Kacie continued to post on social media, and her following ballooned. After about six months, she stopped teaching English online and decided to do social media full time. Dario encouraged this step. \u201cI think it was a really good idea diving into it,\u201d he says today. \u201cIt was the right moment, the right time, and I believed in her from the first moment.\u201d A life together in Italy Almost four years later, Kacie\u2019s expanded her social media presence into a travel company, running group tours around Italy and publishing her own travel guides. Meanwhile, Dario is still passionate about cooking and now works as a fine dining chef at a Florence restaurant. \u201cI really love the life we\u2019ve created here,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cWe live in a beautiful place with great food and he\u2019s got so many awesome things going for him and same with me.\u201d The couple encourage each other in their respective careers and endeavors, but they also savor their downtime. They love living in Florence and exploring Italy together. Dario and Kacie are settled in Florence for now, although they don\u2019t rule out a move elsewhere in the future. \u201cWe\u2019re enjoying the moment,\u201d says Dario. \u201cThe solid thing is the fact that we know we\u2019re in it together. And that\u2019s what makes it so great,\u201d says Kacie. She tells Dario: \u201cI\u2019m not nervous for what the future holds. Because I\u2019ve got you.\u201d Looking back, Kacie finds it serendipitous and surreal to think her spontaneous decision to travel solo in Italy led her to find a new career, a new home and the love of her life. \u201cThere were so many things that had to happen for it to actually happen, but it just felt normal and natural \u2013 like of course this is right and this was supposed to happen,\u201d she says. \u201cYou never really know what life has planned for you. There\u2019s so many good things waiting. You just have to trust it,\u201d adds Kacie. \u201cTrust in the process. And the path that is meant for you will happen, even if it\u2019s not the path that you intended to take for yourself.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/article/chance-encounters-florence-italy-kacie-rose/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_article_bear-encounters-prevent-attacks-wellness", "text": "You\u2019re out for a hike, reveling in glorious nature. Suddenly, you spot a bear. And the bear has spotted you, too. Would you know what to do next? Beth Pratt sure would. She was once on the Old Gardiner Road Trail in Yellowstone National Park, enjoying her run in wild nature. Her reverie came to an end when she came upon a grizzly bear eating flowers.  \u201cI stopped. It stood on its hind legs and looked at me. I knew that wasn\u2019t a threatening gesture,\u201d she told CNN Travel. \u201cI\u2019m not kidding, it waved its paw at me as if to say, \u2018just go on your way,\u2019 and went back to eating.\u201d \u201cAnd I walked slowly away and put some distance between us, and the encounter ended fine.\u201d When it comes to dealing with bears, Pratt does have a thing or two on almost all the rest of us, though. She is the California regional executive director for the National Wildlife Federation, a job she\u2019s had for more than 10 years. She worked in Yellowstone for several years \u2013 and once saw nine grizzlies in one day there.    Finally, she lives on the border of Yosemite National Park, and bears will pass through her yard, including this one seen in the footage above in late September 2021. You can hear the enthusiasm in Pratt\u2019s voice as she shares her bear bona fides and advice to make sure bear/human encounters are delightful, not dangerous. \u201cA wild bear is a beautiful sight to see. It\u2019s incredible to see them in the wild. I never had a bad experience with bears. What I try to get people to feel is respect, not fear, for bears. The animal usually wants to avoid the encounters.\u201d  Bears in the news   Bear attacks are rare, Pratt and US National Park Service websites point out, but they do happen:  \u2022 A disable veteran survived an attack from a mother grizzly at Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming in May 2024. \u201cIt was the most violent thing I have ever experienced.\u201d \u2022 A hunter suffered serious injuries in a grizzly bear attack in British Columbia in May 2024. \u2022 Bear attacks are on the increase in Japan. \u2022 A man lost part of his jaw in a grizzly bear attack in Montana in September 2023. \u2022 Two people died in a suspected grizzly bear attack in Canada\u2019s Banff National Park in late September 2023. \u2022 Two collegiate wrestlers were mauled by a grizzly bear near Cody, Wyoming, in October 2022; they had serious injuries but survived. They illustrate the point that rare doesn\u2019t equal never. Feasts for beasts  While it pays to be diligent at any time, autumn is a particularly good season to bone up on bear facts and safety when many bears are in a phase known as hyperphagia, Pratt said. \u201cIt\u2019s a period in the fall where bears are eating anything and everything to fatten up for hibernation.\u201d  She noted mountain lions are comparatively picky eaters. Not bears.   \u201cThey eat everything: Ants. Roadkill. Flowers. Nuts. And unfortunately, human food that\u2019s not secured. Our food is very attractive to them; it\u2019s easy calories.\u201d   Combine that with the fact that some national and state parks have become very popular and crowded, and you have a recipe for potential trouble. \u201cIf more people are using public lands and more people are in the mix, there\u2019s more potential for encounters and conflict. It does concern me a little bit,\u201d Pratt said. The key is being prepared \u2013 and that\u2019s where Pratt and others in the know come in. First rule of \u2018bear fight club\u2019: Don\u2019t fight The best strategy is to never get in harm\u2019s way by enticing or provoking a wild bear. Trying to give a bear food or approaching cute cubs are particularly terrible ways to start an encounter. That\u2019s just looking for trouble. The US National Park Service site points out each bear and each encounter is different, but there are general guidelines useful in most situations. First of all, keep your distance if you happen upon a bear. Don\u2019t approach it, and give it plenty of room to walk away from you. Yellowstone tells you to stay at least 100 yards (300 feet or 91 meters) away; Shenandoah National Park in Virginia suggests 200 feet (61 meters) for its black bears. You can run afoul of the law as well as the bears if you get too close and end up paying a fine.   Other tips: \u2022 Talk calmly to yourself in low tones to identify yourself as human. \u2022 Walk with a group (we\u2019re smellier and noisier in packs) and stay on designated trails. \u2022 If you have a small child or dog, pick it up. \u2022 Don\u2019t put yourself between cubs and their mother. \u2022  Avoid direct eye contact and move away slowly, sideways if possible. Pratt said don\u2019t be alarmed if a bear stands on its hind legs; it\u2019s not considered an aggressive move. Almost all encounters are peaceful, Pratt said. Many times, people never knew they were even close to a bear, as in this YouTube video that shows two people emerging from a basement oblivious to a nearby bear.  What if a bear starts coming at you anyway?  If a bear starts making assertive moves in your direction, you have important decisions to make \u2013 and fast. First thing is: Stand your ground with bears. With either grizzlies (a subspecies of brown bears) or black bears, \u201cplease don\u2019t run. Bears can outrun anybody,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cDon\u2019t climb a tree either. They can also climb trees better than you.\u201d  New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Division of Fish and Wildlife (where the black bear population is growing) also has some tips: \u2022 Make loud noises by yelling, banging pots and pans or using an airhorn to scare bears away. \u2022 Make yourself look as large as possible by waving your arms.  \u2022 If you\u2019re with other people, stay together. Pratt said you can usually intimidate or bluff your way out of sticky bear situations, depending on the bear species and the situation.  But what if a bear is about to attack? You\u2019re now in the rarest of situations \u2013 you\u2019ve attracted a bear\u2019s attention. It didn\u2019t move off. It\u2019s started coming at you aggressively and fast. You think you\u2019re about to be attacked. What\u2019s next? One very crucial thing is to make a quick ID of the kind of bear, because your strategy is going to be different depending on the type of bear.  If it\u2019s a black bear, the NPS and Pratt have a clear message: Do not run. Do not play dead. \u201cYou want to stand your ground with black bears. Look as intimidating as possible,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cThrow things not at it but near it. Make that black bear intimidated by you. Let it know you are a big person. Pick something up; yell at it. If it attacks, fight back \u2013 aim for the face.\u201d It\u2019s a different situation with grizzlies If you\u2019re dealing with a grizzly that won\u2019t back off and an attack is imminent, you\u2019re advised to do the opposite. You should play dead. \u201cAct as unthreatening as possible with a grizzly. Play dead with a grizzly if it starts to attack,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cTuck and cover. Get into a fetal position. Wrap your hands around your neck. Lay on your stomach. Once you do that, 99 percent of the time the grizzly will move on.\u201d  NPS elaborates: \u201cRemain still until the bear leaves the area. Fighting back usually increases the intensity of such attacks. However, if the attack persists, fight back vigorously.\u201d   Fighting back a grizzly bear is the last resort \u2013 \u201cyour Hail Mary pass\u201d as Pratt called it \u2013 when all other options are out. An exception to this rule: If you\u2019re camping in a tent and are attacked, that bear likely sees you as food. NPS and Pratt say this is a time to fight. How do you tell a black bear from a grizzly? First off, know your area and read up on the bears there. In North America, grizzlies have a much more limited range than black bears do. In the Lower 48, they are in Washington, Montana, Idaho and Wyoming. And then in Alaska, too. They also cover large parts of western Canada. Black bears have more territory. They can be found in as many as 40 US states, much of Canada and even parts of northern Mexico, the National Wildlife Federation says. So say you\u2019re in Quebec, the Appalachians, the Ozarks, California or even parts of Florida, that\u2019s going to be a black bear. But if you\u2019re in Yellowstone or Glacier National Park, for instance, that could be a black bear or a grizzly. That\u2019s when it\u2019s crucial to know how to make a quick visual ID. You can\u2019t go by the color of the fur. Black bears can be black, brown, cinnamon, blond, blue-gray or white, according to Bear.org.  One of the best ways to tell the difference, Pratt said, is to look for a hump at the shoulders. Grizzlies have them. Black bears don\u2019t. She also said the face shapes are different. \u201cBlack bear faces look a little more cuddly to me, a little rounder, with a straight nose. A grizzly bear face looks more like a wild predator and has a dished shape.\u201d This NPS webpage has more helpful ways to tell the differences. Fun facts: Eight bear species can be found all over the world \u2013 from tropical Sri Lanka to the frigid reaches of Russia, Norway and Canada. And European websites such as Bear Watching Slovenia give many of the same safety tips as North Americans get. Bear spray and weapons Some people like to carry bear spray and/or a weapon with them when venturing into bear country.  Pratt is an advocate of the former and says be sure to practice using it first before going into the wild. NPS has helpful tips on using spray to ward off bears. She\u2019s more cautious about bringing firearms with you, especially if you\u2019re inexperienced. \u201cTaking a grizzly out with one shot would be tough. You need to be very experienced with a gun to increase your chance of safety.\u201d A Brigham Young University study in 2008 found spray more effective than a firearm. And spray doesn\u2019t permanently harm a bear. Some people like to carry bear bells on their hikes, hoping the noise will ward off the animals. But the park service says that \u201cYelling, clapping and talking are more effective ways of alerting a bear to your presence.\u201d What campers need to know If you\u2019re out camping overnight, you have extra considerations to take. Kyle Patterson, management specialist and public affairs officer at Rocky Mountain National Park, emailed CNN Travel some ways to keep hungry bears away. Patterson advised using a food storage locker if provided in campgrounds and picnic areas. Also, \u201cavoid storing food and coolers in your vehicle. If you must, store food in airtight containers in the trunk or out of sight. Close vehicle windows completely.\u201d Other tips and cautions: \u2022 Don\u2019t store food in tents or pop-up campers in campgrounds or in vehicles at trailheads. \u2022 Don\u2019t leave food, coolers and dirty cookware unattended. Park rangers may confiscate them and cite you. \u2022 Get rid of garbage in bear-resistant dumpsters and trash cans. Human-fed bears usually end up as chronic problems and need to be removed, Patterson said. \u201cA fed bear is a dead bear.\u201d The ball is in our court Pratt emphasized it\u2019s up to humans to be responsible to these creatures. \u201cThe bears are just being bears. We are way more of a threat to them. Bear attacks are so rare. And fatalities are even rarer,\u201d she said. \u201cThe bears\u2019 lives are more at threat than ours in encounters. I want people to have magical, wonderful experiences in the wild. I want people to feel OK about having these encounters.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/article/bear-encounters-prevent-attacks-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "travel"}}

{"id": "travel_shibuya-city-tokyo-public-drinking-ban-intl-hnk", "text": "One of Tokyo\u2019s most popular tourist neighborhoods is making a move to curb bad behavior \u2013 by taking alcohol indoors. The measure, which is expected to take effect in October, will see drinking alcohol forbidden on streets or public places in Shibuya from 6 p.m. to 5 a.m. every day. The legal drinking age in Japan is 20. Shibuya City, which is a self-governed district within Tokyo, can make its own local regulations. Mayor Ken Hasebe recently told journalists: \u201cWe have been stepping up patrols and other efforts over the last year, but we have had people say, \u2018Well, the rules say you can drink, don\u2019t they?\u2019 By establishing the rule, we would like to convey the district\u2019s intentions, including during patrols \u2014 we would prefer people to enjoy their drinks inside restaurants.\u201d This news may not come as a surprise to local residents. Last fall, Shibuya banned Halloween-related activities in the district, with alcohol cited as a main reason behind the prohibition. That included a ban on drinking alcohol outside of bars and restaurants. Mayor Hasebe says that local businesses supported the regulations in October 2023 and were behind the push to make them permanent. \u201cThe damage caused by overtourism has become serious, resulting in property damage caused by drinking in the street, altercations with local residents, and littering of large amounts of empty cans and bottles,\u201d the city said in a statement last October. Shibuya is home to some of the capital\u2019s most popular attractions, including the Meiji Shrine, Yoyogi Park and the \u201cShibuya scramble,\u201d believed to be the world\u2019s busiest intersection. Japan has struggled to cope with overtourism since fully reopening post-pandemic. More than three million visitors visited the country in both April and May of this year, with the trend likely to continue through the summer. Educating visitors on the local culture has been a large component of dealing with the influx of international tourists. In the historic city of Kyoto, where it\u2019s possible to spot geisha and their apprentices (maiko) around the ancient alleyways, locals have tried to find ways to deter foreigners from harassing the women as they make their way to and from work. Kyoto\u2019s official tourism office has put up posters and distributed pamphlets about different social customs in Japan, from how to use toilets to whether to tip. The advice also extends to geisha, with visitors asked not to touch the women, pull on their kimonos, or take their photos without permission. Local Gion residents have also taken some measures themselves, such as blocking off private alleys. Despite those measures, though, \u201cgeisha paparazzi\u201d and other nuisance tourists still cause conflict between visitors and locals.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/shibuya-city-tokyo-public-drinking-ban-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "travel"}}

Military sites and museums A tiny museum in rural England has one of the finest collections of tanks in the world. And thanks to American fans of military history, its videos have gotten more YouTube views than MoMA in New York or the Louvre in Paris. Here\u2019s how they did it. The first house liberated in the D-Day landings in Normandy (80 years ago this week) was a two-story villa now known as Canada House, in honor of the Canadian troops who battled for France\u2019s freedom. Now the family that owns it has turned it into a memorial for those who served. On the other side of the world, in a small town in the Philippines, a tiny museum tells the story of the largest surrender of US military forces in history and the horrors of the Bataan Death March that followed. Thousands would die, and thousands displayed remarkable and inspiring resilience. Trouble in the skies US airlines are predicted to carry more than 270 million passengers from June 1 to August 31, according to an industry group, and not all of the flights are likely to go smoothly, if recent incidents are any indication. After her checked luggage went missing at a Florida airport in March, a woman tracked her bags to an airport store worker\u2019s home. He\u2019s now been charged with felony theft. In another case, American Airlines didn\u2019t cover themselves in glory when a court filing claimed last month that a child was at fault for being secretly recorded in a plane restroom. The airline has since changed its response, but that\u2019s not its only legal woe of the month. A group of Black passengers is suing American Airlines, alleging they were thrown off a plane in January because of a false body odor complaint. However, the Texas-based airline still managed to squeak in at No. 25 on a new 2024 ranking of the world\u2019s best premium airlines, conducted by AirlineRatings.com.

{"id": "travel_deer-deadly-vehicles-collision", "text": "Retired public relations professional Bonnie Sashin and her husband had just spent a nice Thanksgiving visit and meal with family at her stepson\u2019s suburban home in the Connecticut city of Fairfield, a charming burg of about 61,000 on Long Island Sound. By the time they departed the 2022 family gathering, the sun had already set, Sashin recalls. They cranked up her fairly new Subaru Forester SUV to head to a nearby hotel, where they were staying the night rather than make the two-and-a-half hour drive back to Brookline, Massachusetts, on full stomachs and in full darkness. \u201cAnd just as we turned the corner, practically out of the subdivision where my stepson lives \u2026\u00a0I can feel something hit the car. You know, it\u2019s dark, and I had no idea what could it be. And I was just very alarmed,\u201d Sashin said. \u201cMy husband thought it was some kind of animal, and we of course stopped and fortunately a nice, civic-minded woman in front of us stopped. \u2026 She got out of the car. She saw me. She was really nice. She said, \u2018Oh, that was a deer.\u2019 And she said, \u2018It happens all the time around here.\u2019\u201c The deadly deer problem It turns out that deer-vehicle collisions are far more than a southern Connecticut problem. They\u2019re a problem across much of the United States and in other nations. It also turns out Sashin was fortunate not to have been injured or even killed in the incident. Even people who realize how common deer-vehicle collisions are might be surprised at these startling stats for the United States from this November 2022 study in the journal Cell Biology: \u2022 Around 2.1 million deer-vehicle collisions occur annually. \u2022 The collisions cause more than $10 billion in economic losses annually. \u2022 Each year, they account for some 59,000 human injuries and 440 human deaths. Kip Adams, chief conservation officer with the National Deer Association, notes that deer are much more deadly to Americans each year than those scary movie and TV threats \u2013 sharks, alligators, bears and venomous snakes \u2013 combined. (For instance, there were just two deaths in the United States by shark attack in 2023.) Looks like we should be much more wary of Bambi than of Jaws. And the United States is not alone in having a deer problem. For instance, a 2023 study from Scotland\u2019s nature agency, NatureScot, estimated that 700 people are injured or killed in deer-vehicle collisions in the United Kingdom annually. They grapple with the deer problem in such far-flung places as British Columbia, Japan, Australia and Germany, too. So what can drivers do to protect themselves from unwanted encounters with these herbivores? When time is not on your side Adams says your best shield against a deer collision isn\u2019t a fancy gadget but knowledge. \u201cThe first step in helping to minimize hitting one is to be aware of when they are most active,\u201d he told CNN Travel in a phone interview. \u201cTwo things that play into that. \u2026 One is when they\u2019re most active daily and then also when they are most active annually.\u201d As for the daily factor, sunrise and sunset should be high-alert times for drivers, Adams said. Why is that? \u201cDeer are what\u2019s known as crepuscular \u2013 crepuscular means most active at dawn and dusk,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThe way their eyes are built, they can do the best job avoiding predators and collecting what they need when they move in low-light situations \u2013 that being dusk and that being dawn.\u201d But \u201cthat\u2019s not our peak vision time. So those two things together \u2013 more activity at a time when we can\u2019t see as good \u2013 really play into increased deer-vehicle collisions at those times,\u201d Adams said. Chad Stewart, a deer, elk and moose management specialist with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, concurs. \u201cI would say the hour on either side of both sunrise and sunset are the greatest times when a collision can occur,\u201d he said in an email interview with CNN Travel. \u201cThis is partly due to deer\u2019s activity around that time, but also because of heavy traffic patterns during those hours.\u201d But collisions can occur anytime around the clock, Adams cautions. Keep seasons in mind Collisions can also happen any time of year \u2013 after all, deer don\u2019t hibernate, Adams points out. But two times of year are typically more high risk. Adams said the first one is spring. That\u2019s fawning time, and \u201cdeer are way more active around roads,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen a doe is having her fawn, the does become extremely territorial of those areas. \u2026 What happens is deer get spread out a lot more on the landscape, which means that they\u2019re more apt to, you know, be near a road.\u201d But autumn is the season most fraught with danger, Adams said, \u201cand the majority of that occurs in November. During that time, deer greatly increase their daily movement patterns,\u201d he said, especially the bucks. Research from State Farm insurance company also highlights November as the most likely month of the year to have a collision with an animal. Where to be on high alert As Bonnie Sashin\u2019s collision in a Connecticut suburb illustrates, you don\u2019t have to be out in wilderness to collide with a deer. \u201cTypically, suburban areas can hold higher densities of deer, and with more miles driven by vehicles occurring in these areas compared to rural areas, total number of collisions tends to be highest in these areas,\u201d Stewart cautioned. \u201cBut with that being said, any place has the potential for a collision.\u00a0 Especially where habitat transitions occur (e.g. forest to field), which are commonly used locations for deer.\u201d Adams said be on extra guard where the woods come out close to the road, where \u201cwe have very little opportunity of seeing those deer prior to them being in front of a vehicle.\u201d The suburbs are also a big problem, he said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s extremely difficult to manage deer populations in those areas. We can\u2019t go in there in most cases and hunt like we do in more rural areas.\u201d States with the biggest deer problems Some US states have a bigger problem with deer-vehicle collisions than others. State Farm compiles annual statistics assessing the risk in each state. While the insurance company\u2019s statistics cover all animal-vehicle collisions, deer account for the majority of them. Seventeen states are considered \u201chigh risk\u201d for an animal-vehicle collision, according to the latest State Farm report for 2023-24. Topping the list is West Virginia, where drivers have a 1 in 38 annual risk of being in an animal-involved claim, State Farm says. That\u2019s not surprising to Adams. The Mountain State is filled with forests, has a high deer population and lacks much in the way of dense urban areas. \u201cThey have a lot of winding roads through wooded areas which further reduces the visibility. A lot of factors play together there that definitely put West Virginia at the top,\u201d Adams said. Rounding out the top 5 states are: No. 2: Montana (1 in 53 chance)No. 3: Pennsylvania (1 in 59 chance)No. 4: Michigan (1 in 60 chance)No. 5: Wisconsin (1 in 60 chance) Your best bets to avoid colliding with an animal: Nevada, where State Farm says the chance is just 1 in 770, and Hawaii (1 in 710 chance). Defensive driving Once you\u2019re better aware of when and where the collision risk is highest, then it\u2019s time to put driving strategies into place. \u201cBasic safe driving principles apply to reduce your chance at a collision.\u00a0 First and foremost, avoid distracted driving,\u201d Stewart said.\u00a0Also, slow down in areas known to have high deer numbers so you can \u201chave better reaction should one jump out in front of your vehicle.\u201d Adams said use your high beams whenever possible in deer territory \u2013 but don\u2019t blind oncoming traffic. Stewart\u2019s not sold on gadget remedies. \u201cUsing things like car mounted whistles are not proven to reduce or prevent collisions from occurring, so saving your money and not falling into a false sense of security with these items is advisable.\u201d However, do make good use of your car horn, advises the National Deer Association in this YouTube video. Some other tips from the Michigan State Police: \u2022 Deer typically follow one another in single file, so if you see one deer, there are likely more nearby.\u2022 Look for the reflection of headlights in a deer\u2019s eyes and deer silhouettes on the shoulder of the road.\u2022 Scan the roadside while driving, especially around wooded lots, fencerows, field edges and areas near water. Do. Not. Swerve. Unfortunately, some drivers despite all their caution are going to have to make a split-second decision \u2013 and fight a natural impulse \u2013 when there\u2019s a deer ahead in the road. \u201cWe have a campaign in Michigan called \u2018Don\u2019t veer for deer.\u2019 The reason this phrase is used is because while nobody wants to hit a deer, there can be far worse consequences by swerving to avoid a deer and hitting something else, like a telephone pole or another car,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cSometimes, collisions with deer simply can\u2019t be avoided. But the important thing is to not make it worse for you or somebody else by abruptly and erratically leaving your lane.\u201d Adams dispenses the same advice with a fatherly touch. \u201cI have a 17-year-old daughter. I talk to her about this all the time. Try to avoid the deer but do not swerve because your chances of having a bad accident are much higher,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s way better to hit a deer with the front of your car going straight where that car is built to withstand an impact than it is to swerve and go off the road\u201d and possibly hit a tree or another vehicle, Adams said. The problem with pets and feeding Collisions account for the vast majority of interactions that result in injuries or deaths to people, Adams said, but they aren\u2019t the only ways people can be hurt by these generally docile grazers. Though incidents are very rare, he said deer that have been raised in captivity and have lost their fear of humans can end up hurting the hands that fed them. \u201cYou can find accounts where \u2026 somebody got attacked by a deer, like literally attacked. In almost every case, that was a captive animal that had been hand reared.\u201d Several years ago, a Colorado woman was cited for illegally raising a young deer that attacked and gored one of her neighbors, according to state wildlife officials. In 2023, a Florida man\u2019s pet deer was euthanized on the scene by officials after the animal attacked one of his neighbors. Also in 2023, a man on vacation in Greece approached too closely to a deer for a selfie. The deer rammed him and broke some of his ribs. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission warns people not to feed deer and to treat them with the respect wild creatures deserve. Hunting accidents Hunting is the other time where human-deer interactions can go wrong. In 2019, an experienced Arkansas hunter was found severely injured in the woods, his body riddled with antler puncture wounds from a deer he had shot but had not killed. He later died. Experts say hunters should wait 15 to 30 minutes before approaching a shot deer to make sure it is dead. However, the biggest danger in deer hunting is other people, Adams said. \u201cHunting is very safe, and it has gotten way safer over the past couple of decades with hunter safety programs, but accidents still do happen. And it\u2019s very clear that the most dangerous person in the woods to you, if you\u2019re hunting, is the person you walked in the woods with.\u201d Again, awareness is key, Adams said. \u201cI have a family camp in northern Pennsylvania. We have a lot of friends and family that hunt that we share our land with. \u2026 If we are going out as a group to hunt deer, bear, whatever \u2026 I have a little safety talk and tell everybody, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s be careful today.\u2019 \u201c \u2018I came away lucky\u2019 Bonnie Sashin\u2019s Thanksgiving night collision with a deer happened in a flash. But the repercussions took a while to sort out. The Good Samaritan who stopped in front of her was quite helpful, she said. \u201cFirst thing she said to me \u2013 which was the best piece of advice for us because no one was hurt \u2013 was call the police \u2026 because you\u2019re gonna want a record for your insurance company.\u201d Sashin said she later learned about a friend who collided with a deer and didn\u2019t call the police right away \u2013\u00a0and the adjuster gave her a hard time. The front fender of Sashin\u2019s new car was bashed in, but she and her husband were able to drive her SUV back to Massachusetts, where they learned the vehicle could be repaired vs. being totaled. \u201cI went in to my body shop where I know the guy, his name is Paul. \u2026 He said, \u2018Bonnie, get in line. You know how many cars I have that have been hit by deer in the last week?\u2019 \u201d There were five or six ahead of hers, he told her. \u201cThe pain in the butt part is that you gotta wait a long time these days with a body shop. \u2026 It\u2019s very hard to get parts.\u201d She had to wait until February to get her SUV repaired. Sashin and her husband continue to drive to family trips in the Northeast, but they try to be off the road before dark these days. Despite everything, she\u2019s grateful they weren\u2019t hurt or the vehicle totaled. \u201cI came away lucky.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/deer-deadly-vehicles-collision/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_article_eva-longoria-searching-for-mexico-restaurants", "text": "You\u2019ll no doubt be hungry after watching \u201cEva Longoria: Searching for Mexico.\u201d Every episode is full of mouthwatering regional specialties prepared by chefs all over the country. For those wanting to follow in Eva Longoria\u2019s footsteps, below is a guide to the restaurants and locations she visited. Veracruz: Cradle of Mexican gastronomy Longoria visits the coastal state of Veracuz. Its position along some 400 miles (645 kilometers) of the Caribbean Sea made it a focal point for military conflict \u2013 and the collision of food cultures. \u201cThe people of Veracruz took this treasure trove of ingredients passing in and out of the port and created a whole new cuisine,\u201d Longoria said. \u2022 Longoria met chef Erik Guerrero, who aims to make fishing more sustainable in Veracruz, at Namik restaurant, where they enjoyed ceviche with hot beans and soft shell crab taco. \u2022 Next up, she joined actor and friend Ana de la Reguera for some coffee at historic Caf\u00e9 La Parroquia, Veracruz Port. Tap on the glass three times to ring for milk. \u2022 She headed to the lush inland mountains to meet coffee farming expert Itzel Mendoza at Cafetal Privado en Coetzala to learn how the precious bean is grown. There, they gathered flowers in the fields to be added to chicken stew, a salsa and a palm flower fritter. \u2022 Back in Veracruz Port, she met food historian Nidia Hern\u00e1ndez Medel at Chuchumb\u00e9, a cultural center, to cook some fried yucca, which is traced back to the city\u2019s African slave era.  \u2022 It\u2019s back out of the city to meet with vanilla farmer Norma Gaya, of Gaya Vanilla and Spices, for some vanilla chicken. \u2022 At El Tajin ruins, a Totonac settlement, Longoria met cook Do\u00f1a Marta. She\u2019s the founder of Smoke Women, which keeps ancient Totonac traditions alive. They enjoyed alcamaya (fresh-water shrimp) stew and mushroom empanadas. \u2022  Chef Luis Palmeros, a rising star on the Mexican food scene, introduces Longoria to traditional cook Do\u00f1a Rocio at Cuarto Blanco Market in the inland city of Xalapa (the capital of Veracruz state), for a traditional stuffed jalape\u00f1o. He then takes Longoria to his restaurant, El Cuarto Blanco, for his modern take on the dish. Jalisco: Birthplace of traditions \u2022 At Tortas Ahogadas El Pr\u00edncipe Heredero in Guadalajara, Longoria samples a torta ahogada \u2013 the region\u2019s beloved \u201cdrowned\u201d sandwich. \u2022 In Guadalajara\u2019s Santa Teresita neighborhood, Longoria samples a new preparation of native ingredient chinchayote at Xokol, a restaurant run by chefs \u00d3scar Segundo and Xrysw Ruelas D\u00edaz. \u2022 Longoria attends a charreada, a Mexican rodeo, that takes place at Lienzo Charro Charros De Jalisco. Afterward, she sampled birria, the celebrated goat stew from Jalisco, at the clubhouse. \u2022 Chef Fabian Delgado Padilla treats Longoria to mole with pork belly at his restaurant palReal in Guadlajara\u2019s Colonia Americana neighborhood. \u2022 At Lake Chapala, about 30 miles south of Guadalajara, Longoria meets with members of one of the oldest indigenous groups in Mexico, the Coca people, to talk about their fight to preserve their way of life and history on the lake. They feast on local fish called charales. \u2022 Longoria meets friends Mariana Padilla and Alejandra Pelayo at traditional cantina La Iberia in Guadalajara. Women weren\u2019t allowed in cantinas until the 1980s, Longoria said. \u2022 Then she heads to to the town of Tequila, where Salvador Rosales Trejo shows her how tequila is produced by Tequila Cascahuin using traditional methods. \u2022 Longoria and chef Fabian Delgado Padilla visit Yunaites, his casual restaurant inside a municipal market in Guadalajara, for gorditas topped with pork and mole. Nuevo Le\u00f3n: Where beef is king Say adios to vegetables for a while. Nuevo Le\u00f3n is the land of meat. In this state in northeast Mexico, carne asada is a go-to meal. And it\u2019s the cuisine Longoria grew up with in Texas.  \u2022 In Monterrey, Longoria met up with Alejandro Guti\u00e9rrez, founder of the Mexican Society of Grill Masters, to try the region\u2019s specialty: carne asada (grilled meat). In August, there\u2019s a grill master competition in Santiago, outside of Monterrey. \u2022 Tacos Do\u00f1a Mary La Gritona has been serving breakfast tacos in Monterrey for nearly 20 years. \u201cThese are the best tortillas I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d said Longoria. \u2022 El Jonuco restaurant celebrates the products of Nuevo Le\u00f3n with a focus on seasonal ingredients. They\u2019re known for their cabrito (roasted goat). The restaurant celebrates the little-known history of crypto-Judaism in the region, Longoria said. \u2022 Dona Lupita\u2019s Caf\u00e9, located in the backyard of her home right next to Highway 85 south of Monterrey, is famed for its legendary tamales. \u2022 La Divinita bakery is one of the most successful bakery chains in Monterrey. The founder uses local oranges to make a traditional dessert with Longoria. \u2022 Koli restaurant, run by the three Rivera Rio brothers, is a fine dining restaurant that aims to tell the story of Nuevo Le\u00f3n. Oaxaca: A gastronomic capital Nestled within three vast mountain ranges, Oaxaca is a magnet for food lovers in the know.  A thrill of any visit here is sampling the moles, as well as dishes such as tlayudas (thin Oaxacan \u201cpizzas\u201d), spicy hot chocolate and asado grilled in smoky market stalls. \u201cIt is on another level gastronomically, one of the best places I\u2019ve been to in the world,\u201d Longoria said. \u2022 Mercado de Abastos is a giant market on the edge of Oaxaca City. If you want your chocolate fix, the mercado is still the place to come. This region is known for its moles \u2013 complex sauces featuring many blended ingredients.  \u2022 Casa Oaxaca makes Oaxaca\u2019s famous mole negro drizzled over turkey breast. Longoria called it a magnificently complex and sophisticated sauce. \u2022 At Las Quince Letras, chef Celia Flori\u00e1n made Longoria quesillo \u2013 a stretched Oaxacan cheese --  with crickets and edible flowers. \u2022 In the area of Oaxaca located on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, several muxes, who identify as a third gender and are guardians of Zapotecan cuisine, cooked up stuffed pork with pineapple served alongside pureed potatoes. Longoria called it \u201cthe perfect combination.\u201d \u2022 The farming town of Santa Ana Zegache is the unassuming epicenter of corn. Corn has been worshipped for over 6,000 years and is still the beating heart of Mexican cuisine.  \u2022 In San Baltazar Chichicapam, Longoria visited a palenque (agave farm) run by Do\u00f1a Berta, one of very few female mezcaleras. The farm produces mezcal, the smoky liquor for which this region is famed. \u2022 La Cocina de Humo is a hip restaurant using local ingredients. Chef Thalia Barrios Garc\u00eda is known for her heirloom tomato salad with beet puree and herbal dressing. Longoria said it\u2019s the \u201cperfect dish.\u201d Here\u2019s the recipe.   Yucat\u00e1n: Defined by the Maya Mayan DNA runs through the recipes in Yucat\u00e1n, which has the largest Maya population in Mexico.  The state is located along the Gulf of Mexico and is surrounded by dense forests that isolate it off from the rest of the country. The Maya thrived here for thousands of years before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors in the 1500s. The region\u2019s geography and turbulent history have had a significant impact on the cuisine. \u2022 Ixi\u2019im mixes modern and ancestral techniques and flavors. The restaurant has its own version of the most famous dish from the Yucat\u00e1n, cochinita pibil. Chef Luis Ronz\u00f3n slow-cooks pork underground after it\u2019s marinated in sour orange and spices.  \u2022 Condimentos Enrique is a family-run business that sells recados (spice pastes) in Mercado de Santiago in M\u00e9rida. \u2022 At Huniik, which means \u201cunique spirit\u201d in Maya, chef Roberto Sol\u00eds makes onion tempura with black recado. \u201cI have never had anything like this. This is gorgeous, and it\u2019s delicious,\u201d said Longoria.  \u2022 In his home in Xoc\u00e9n, chef Alberto Kuku prepared one of the oldest dishes, Mayan chicken tamales, for Hanal Pix\u00e1n, a holiday celebrated by the Maya people that means \u201cfood for the souls.\u201d The food honoring the dead \u201ccan easily be carried back to the underworld,\u201d he said. \u2022 Chef Regina Escalante, who runs Merci in M\u00e9rida, showed Longoria how to make grilled seabass with mango, avocado and flor de sal. \u201cI\u2019d have this as my last meal on Earth,\u201d said Longoria. Here\u2019s the recipe. \u2022 At Uxmal, Mayan archaeologist Don Pepe cooked up smoked pork and bean stew. It cooks underground for 12 hours.  \u2022 Kinich in Izamal is famous for its queso relleno. A key ingredient is, surprisingly, Dutch cheese. See how it\u2019s made:  Mexico City: The city of tacos \u201cIt\u2019s crazy, it\u2019s crowded, it\u2019s noisy \u2013 and I love it!\u201d Longoria said as she walked the streets of Mexico City, where she lives part-time with her family. This region was once the capital of the mighty Aztec empire, known as Tenochtitl\u00e1n until the Spanish invaded about 500 years ago and changed its name to Mexico City. Here are the places Eva Longoria visited in the episode: \u2022 Tomasa is a Mexican bakery known for its conchas, a fluffy sweet bread with a crunchy topping.  \u2022 El Huequito in the Historic Center serves up delicious al pastor tacos, which are a staple in Mexico City. \u2022 Tacos Los Alexis is sizzling hot in the taco world. Owner Alexis Ayala uses his five-star culinary training to transform traditional recipes from his childhood into to-die-for gourmet tacos.  \u2022 Contramar in Roma, the bohemian part of town, is one of Longoria\u2019s favorite restaurants. Owner and chef Gabriela C\u00e1mara made her signature dish: pescado a la talla. \u2022 M\u00e1ximo Bistrot, a gourmet restaurant that marries French and Mexican cuisine, is run by chef Eduardo \u201cLalo\u201d Garc\u00eda. For Longoria, he made a roasted beet salad with rocket and wilted purslane. Best known as a weed, purslane is nonetheless edible and very nutritious. \u2022 Mercado de Jamaica is one of hundreds of markets in the city. At the street food stalls, Longoria tried green chorizo tacos and tlacoyos, thick oval-shaped tortillas typically stuffed with beans or cheese. \u2022 Casa Tochan refugee shelter is the first shelter for immigrants in Mexico City. The residents cook dishes from their homeland to share with their housemates.  \u2022 El Moro is an institution famous for its churros and chocolate. \u2022 Hiyoko restaurant in Little Tokyo cooks up a Mexican-Japanese fusion. Chef and restaurateur Edo L\u00f3pez whipped up tapioca tostadas, chicken skewers with ants and duck donburi.  After each episode, we\u2019ll add to this story with the latest locations where you can sample food featured in \u201cSearching for Mexico.\u201d  Sign up for CNN\u2019s Unlocking Mexico newsletter.

{"id": "travel_brazil-bus-stop-chance-encounters", "text": "Tristano always loves telling the tale of how he met his wife Alessandra \u2013 it\u2019s an amazing, continent-spanning love story. For Tristano, this story will also forever be interlinked with another amazing, continent-spanning story \u2013 one of friendship. So whenever Tristano recounts his love story, he begins several years before he first crossed paths with his wife \u2013 in 2012, to be precise. That was the year Italian-born Tristano studied abroad in Sydney, Australia and spent a few days on vacation in Fiji. Tristano loved the Pacific island nation \u2013 the spectacular beaches, the blue waters, the palm trees. Plus, he made a friend: a guy called Gustavo, from Brazil, who was also staying in Tristano\u2019s hostel. The two crossed paths on Tristano\u2019s first night, and immediately clicked. \u201cWe got along very well,\u201d Tristano tells CNN Travel today. Gustavo, it seemed, had \u201cbeen literally everywhere.\u201d And his thirst for adventure was infectious. Tristano sat with Gustavo in the hostel bar for hours, talking about their respective travels. Tristano was impressed and inspired \u2013 and felt he\u2019d found a kindred spirit. \u201cHe was a person that really motivated me to travel more and more,\u201d says Tristano. Post-Fiji, the two friends stayed in touch \u2013 tracking one another\u2019s adventures on social media, and regularly catching up over messaging app WhatsApp. \u201cOver the following years, I traveled to many places where Gustavo had lived or been, so he always gave me tips \u2013 what to do, what not to do, where to stay, which hostels to go to\u2026\u201d recalls Tristano. Cut to 2016. Tristano had three weeks of vacation to use before the year was up. He was considering going somewhere in South America. In one of his regular text exchanges with Gustavo, Tristano mentioned his potential plans. In response, Gustavo said he was actually back in his home country of Brazil \u2013 and planned to be based in Sao Paulo for the next few months. \u201cAnd then it just hit me,\u201d says Tristano. \u201cI thought, \u2018I\u2019ll go to Brazil. It\u2019s a no-brainer, because if I find good flights, I have one person there I know and I can meet up with him again.\u2019 \u201cSo I literally booked flights within half an hour of talking to him. And that was the reason I went \u2013 and how I ended up meeting Alessandra\u2026\u201d A bus stop meeting Tristano started his Brazil adventure in Rio de Janeiro. On his second day there, he decided to walk from his hostel in Ipanema Beach to Rio\u2019s Copacabana neighborhood. Tristano didn\u2019t get far before he realized this walk was more of a trek than he\u2019d anticipated. He checked Google Maps on his phone, and realized he could hop on a bus that\u2019d take half the time. Following his phone directions, Tristano headed to the bus stop. And once he was at what he thought was the right stop, he glanced around at the other people waiting. There were a couple of other tourists, also peering at their phones. And then there was a young woman dressed in what Tristano thought was  \u201cbusiness casual.\u201d She looked like she was en route to work. When Tristano met her eyes, the woman smiled. She seemed friendly and confident. So Tristano approached her and politely asked \u2013 in subpar, apologetic Portuguese \u2013 if he was waiting at the right place for the bus to Copacabana. In English, the woman replied. \u201cYes, you\u2019re in the right place,\u201d she said. Then she smiled again. When she smiled, her whole face lit up, and Tristano couldn\u2019t help but smile back. \u201cShe seemed like a very bright person, always smiling,\u201d he recalls today. The woman at the bus stop introduced herself as Alessandra. As Tristano had guessed, she was en route to work that morning. \u201cI actually never usually went to that bus stop,\u201d Alessandra tells CNN Travel today. (Alessandra and Tristano have requested their last names not be included in this article for privacy reasons.) The day she met Tristano, Alessandra had taken a slightly different route that morning as she\u2019d had to pick something up at the store before work. Before Tristano approached her, Alessandra hadn\u2019t noticed him \u2013 she\u2019d been in commuter mode, focused on the journey at hand. But when Tristano started speaking to to her in his awkward Portuguese, Alessandra found him charming. And then they talked a little as they waited for the bus \u2013 Tristano told Alessandra he was on vacation for three weeks, she asked him how he was finding Rio so far, explaining she\u2019d lived there since she was a kid. The conversation flowed easily \u2013 so much so that when the bus pulled up, Tristano and Alessandra got on together and, in silent agreement, decided to sit next to each other and continue talking. \u201cWe sat together for probably 15, 20 minutes on the bus ride, just chatting casually,\u201d recalls Tristano. It was a brief journey, but just before the bus pulled up at Tristano\u2019s stop, Tristano turned to Alessandra and asked for her number. He suggested to Alessandra it\u2019d be nice to get to know a Rio local, \u201csomebody who can give me good tips.\u201d \u201cI was going to travel to the other areas of Brazil for the next two weeks, but I knew I was coming back to Rio,\u201d he explains. Alessandra was wary of handing out her phone number to a guy she didn\u2019t really know. But she thought Tristano seemed sweet \u2013 and in all honesty, she assumed she\u2019d never hear from him again. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect anything, especially because he was traveling around Brazil,\u201d she says. But Tristano texted Alessandra right away. And over the next couple of weeks, as Tristano visited Gustavo in Sao Paulo and explored the rest of the country, he and Alessandra contnued to message back and forth. A first date in Rio Once Tristano was back in Rio, he contacted Alessandra to ask if she would like to meet for dinner. Alessandra agreed, but then at the last minute canceled \u2013 explaining she had a headache. Tristano wondered if this was an excuse, whether Alessandra wasn\u2019t actually that interested. Still, he suggested they rearrange for the following night. \u201cThen we actually went out to dinner,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then the rest is history.\u201d Alessandra actually did have a headache the night before \u2013 a throbbing migraine. She was happy the date got rearranged, and looking forward to seeing Tristano again. But she went into the evening with no expectations. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to feel something romantic, just an opportunity to get to know him,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut then, well, once we sat at the table, I saw his green eyes shining. And I felt something sparking after that.\u201d Alessandra found Tristano to be a supportive, encouraging listener. They seamlessly segued between fun, lighthearted conversations and more in-depth discussions. \u201cThe talk was very interesting,\u201d Alessandra recalls. \u201cHe was very interested in my life in Rio, and how hard, let\u2019s say, my life was compared to his.\u201d As for Tristano, he loved getting a glimpse into Alessandra\u2019s world and her mind \u2013 and learning more about her and her childhood growing up in Rio. \u201cWe agreed to meet the very next day,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt was a weekend. And we spent the whole day walking around the lagoon in Rio, eating ice cream, chatting and laughing and just having a very nice time.\u201d In the evening, Alessandra and Tristano went out for drinks, and then to a club together. \u201cThat\u2019s when we kissed for the first time,\u201d Tristano recalls. Tristano and Alessandra were growing closer. But the next day was Tristano\u2019s last in Rio. The two spent all day together, right up until Tristano had to leave. \u201cWhat left a mark on me was the moment we said goodbye,\u201d says Tristano. \u201cAt the metro station, she started crying.\u201d As Tristano consoled Alessandra, hugged her and wiping away her tears, he also felt emotional. Having to leave felt like \u201ca big sadness,\u201d as he puts it. The feeling weighed on him. \u201cAnd it was also a big surprise, you\u2019re like, \u2018How can I feel this after meeting somebody for literally 48 hours?\u2019 So it felt very strong \u2013 and also very uncertain.\u201d Tristano and Alessandra wanted to see each other again, but both said goodbye thinking it might never happen. As he left, Tristano thanked Alessandra for their time together \u2013 something she took to mean things between them had ended before they\u2019d even began. But although Tristano returned to the UK \u2013 where he was living at the time \u2013 he and Alessandra remained in constant contact. They texted good morning and good night. They sent each other photos of what they were up to each day. Before long, they both admitted they were desperate to see one another again. \u201cAnd so only three months later, we decided to travel to Colombia together,\u201d says Tristano. This trip sealed the deal, and it was \u201cthe real start of the relationship,\u201d says Tristano. \u201cSo we kept meeting,\u201d he says. \u201cVisiting different places every three, four months.\u201d \u201cIt was sad, anytime we had to say goodbye,\u201d recalls Alessandra. But they mostly tried to focus on \u201cjust enjoying the time together,\u201d she says. After all, it was still unclear what the future held \u2013 and whether Alessandra and Tristano could build a future across continents. \u201cI always thought, you know, this obviously cannot go on forever. At some point, we\u2019re going to have to decide what we do,\u201d recalls Tristano. \u201cAnd I wasn\u2019t sure either way, because I knew that not being together wasn\u2019t I wasn\u2019t going to be happy, she wasn\u2019t going to be happy\u2026\u201d But the alternative \u2013 one of them moving across the globe to be with the other \u2013 seemed like a big step and a tough decision. A big step After a year of meeting in destinations across the globe, Alessandra came to Italy for the first time, and met Tristano\u2019s family. A few months later, Tristano met Alessandra\u2019s loved ones in Brazil. Things between them seemed to have naturally moved towards something more serious, more concrete. Around this time, in early 2018, Tristano\u2019s job took him from the UK to Germany. As he prepared to move, Tristano asked Alessandra if she\u2019d like to move to Germany with him. Alessandra spent an emotional week debating her response. She felt like her life had turned \u201cupside down\u201d and she jumped back and forth between certainty about her love for Tristano, fear of the unknown and sadness at the idea of leaving Brazil. \u201cIt was such a big move, leaving my family, friends, job, sunny days and the beach,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to go, but I didn\u2019t want to give up on my life in Brazil and my family.\u201d \u201cBut after this week, I said, \u2018Look, I have nothing to lose, I better try and if it doesn\u2019t work then I can\u2019t regret something I didn\u2019t do.\u2019 And my mom supported me.\u201d Alessandra\u2019s mother liked Tristano \u2013 and she trusted her daughter\u2019s decision. Some of Alessandra\u2019s friends were more wary, and suggested Tristano was \u201cjust playing with her.\u201d \u201cBut I always followed my heart,\u201d says Alessandra. She believed in Tristano and their future. \u201cIt felt right to jump,\u201d she says. And so in 2018, Alessandra and Tristano moved to Germany together. \u201cI was excited for this new chapter, but also concerned with the German language, which I had zero knowledge of and the winter weather,\u201d recalls Alessandra.\u00a0 \u201cNevertheless, I was lucky enough to find a job in a multicultural agency, which uses English as the main language. And got used to enjoying the cold months with warm clothes and food.\u201d It also helped that Germany wasn\u2019t Tristano\u2019s home country either. He was also learning the language. And living in a third country allowed the couple to experience a new culture together. A proposal 2018 was also the year Tristano asked Alessandra to marry him. He prepared her a multiple course meal in their apartment, presenting each course under a metal food cover dome \u2013 like servers do in fancy restaurants. When he got to what Alessandra assumed was the final course there was a surprise \u2013 it wasn\u2019t a dessert, but a ring. \u201cI was really surprised,\u201d says Alessandra. \u201cAnd then he asked me to marry him in Portuguese, which made it really special to me.\u201d Tristano and Alessandra enjoyed a small wedding ceremony. Then they started carving out a life together \u2013 settling into new jobs and looking towards the future. \u201cWe helped each other to follow our goals,\u201d says Tristano. Last year, in 2023, Alessandra and Tristano welcomed a son together, Gabriele. They\u2019re raising Gabriele to speak four languages \u2013 Italian, Portuguese, German and English. \u201cUntil Alessandra moved to Germany, we spoke English to each other,\u201d recalls Tristano. \u201cBut then we obviously decided, \u2018Okay, we cannot spend our life speaking English. It\u2019s not our native language for either of us.\u2019\u201d The couple vowed to become fluent in one another\u2019s languages \u2013 a vow they kept. \u201cSo now we basically switch between Portuguese and Italian every few months,\u201d explains Tristano. In May, Tristano and Alessandra\u2019s son Gabriele turned one. Earlier this year, Alessandra and Tristano took him to Brazil for the first time, for an extended two month trip to visit family and loved ones. \u201cWe spent many weeks of those two months in Rio. And for the last one and a half weeks we stayed, actually, in the Copacabana area,\u201d says Tristano. Staying there naturally took the couple back to their first meeting, eight years ago, at the Rio bus stop. Thinking back on how far they\u2019d come was emotional for them both. \u201cIt was crazy,\u201d says Tristano. \u201cWe were doing the same bus route with our son. I don\u2019t even know how to describe it.\u201d A life-changing series of events A few days after he met Alessandra at the Rio bus stop back in 2016, Tristano met up with his good friend Gustavo in Sao Paulo. Tristano remembers they both talked about their love lives. Tristano barely knew Alessandra then \u2013 and had no reason to assume he\u2019d ever see her again \u2013 but he still found himself effusing to Gustavo about the woman from the bus stop. \u201cWe shared stories, and I said, \u2018You know, I actually met a girl, Alessandra.\u2019 And I told him about her \u2013 just how interesting she was and so on,\u201d recalls Tristano. Tristano updated Gustavo on his romance with Alessandra as the relationship developed over the next couple of years. He always hoped the two of them would be able to meet, and he often told Gustavo he credited him with putting him on the path to meet Alessandra. In the summer of 2019, Tristano realized he hadn\u2019t heard from Gustavo for a while. He reached out on WhatsApp, but the message went unread and unanswered. \u201cI didn\u2019t think much of it,\u201d says Tristano. \u201cBut then I went on his Facebook page, and I realized that he had drowned during a swimming excursion in Hawaii.\u201d Tristano was in shock. His friend had passed away a few months prior. As they didn\u2019t have any mutual friends, the news had passed him by. Tristano sat at his laptop, reading the words over and over again. With a sinking feeling, he realized he\u2019d never see his friend again, that Alessandra and Gustavo would never meet. \u201cI always imagined that if we were going to have a wedding, with a big reception and so on, Gustavo would be the main person I would thank for meeting Alessandra \u2013 because it was thanks to him that I actually ended up going to Brazil,\u201d says Tristano. \u201cObviously, that could not happen.\u201d Tristano was heartbroken. Amid his grief, he searched Facebook for Gustavo\u2019s mother\u2019s details. He sent her a friend request. \u201cI got in touch with his mom. And I told her about the whole story, and she was very happy to hear that thanks to Gustavo\u2019s passion for traveling and his friends, he made a massive contribution to our life,\u201d says Tristano. Tristano is still in touch with Gustavo\u2019s mother. And he still credits his friend with changing his life. He sees his life story as defined by two serendipitous travel encounters: first with Gustavo, and then with Alessandra. Both stories, to Tristano, illustrate the power of travel and connections. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t traveled to Fiji and met him, I would have certainly not traveled to Brazil in 2016 either,\u201d says Tristano. \u201cAnd my son Gabriele would not be here today.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/brazil-bus-stop-chance-encounters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "travel"}}

But in recent days, the restrooms in this UNESCO-listed World Heritage site have been earning more attention than the views. A video recently shared on various Chinese news and social media sites shows a set of timers installed above a row of toilet cubicles in a female washroom, with each stall getting its own digital counter. When a stall is unoccupied, the pixelated LED screen displays the word \u201cempty\u201d in green. If in use, it shows the number of minutes and seconds the door has been locked. \u2018We won\u2019t kick people out midway\u2019 The original video was reportedly taken by a visitor who sent it to the\u00a0Xiaoxiang Morning Herald,\u00a0a state-run local newspaper. \u201cI found it quite advanced technologically so you don\u2019t have to queue outside or knock on a bathroom door,\u201d the paper quoted the visitor as saying. \u201cBut I also found it a little bit embarrassing. It felt like I was being monitored.\u201d A staff member at the attraction reportedly told the Xioxiang Morning Herald that the timers were installed to cope with an increase in visitors to the attraction \u2013 and that includes the facilities inside the tourist site. \u201cThey aren\u2019t there to control the durations you could use the bathrooms,\u201d the staff member was quoted by the newspaper as saying. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible that we would kick someone out [of the bathroom stall] midway. And we aren\u2019t setting a time limit such as five or 10 minutes of how long one could use the toilets.\u201d Nanchang Evening News, a state-run newspaper, quoted a staff member of the park\u00a0as saying the timer has been in operation since May 1 of this year and is primarily a safety measure, \u201censuring the well-being of all guests, in case some guests use the toilet for an extended period and an emergency occurs.\u201d The news has stirred up plenty of debate on China\u2019s social media sites. Some netizens on popular micro-blogging platform Weibo supported the new timers, saying they would discourage visitors from sitting and scrolling on their mobile phones while in the stalls. \u201cA tourist site isn\u2019t an office \u2013 who would spend their time in the toilets? Is it really necessary?\u201d said one netizen. \u201cWhy don\u2019t they just spend the money on building more washrooms?\u201d said another. Others said that it would help those who have actual medical emergencies and may not be able to call for assistance. Record-breaking visitor numbers Inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001, Yungang Buddhist Grottoes is one of the biggest attractions in northern China\u2019s Shanxi province. The ticketed scenic area received 3 million visitors in 2023, a record high for the tourist site and a significant increase from its second busiest year, in 2019 (with 1.98 million visits). And Yungang Buddhist Grottoes has been upgrading more than just its washrooms. In recent years, officials have introduced new shows and added new mini-attractions within the area to boost its appeal.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/toilet-timers-china-yungang-buddhist-grottoes-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_vacation-fling-love-story-chance-encounters", "text": "Guillermo Barrantes relationship with Larry Mock was supposed to begin and end in Palm Springs. It was a \u201ccasual, brief encounter.\u201d A vacation dalliance that only lasted half a day. \u201cIt was just so casual, so easily nothing could have happened from it,\u201d Guillermo tells CNN Travel. \u201cWe could have walked away and just had our lives separate. But of course that didn\u2019t happen, because it wasn\u2019t meant to be that way. It was meant to be the way that it was. That it is.\u201d It all started in summer 2013. Guillermo - then in his early 40s - was on vacation in the California resort city of Palm Springs. He was in a phase of life where, he says, he was prioritizing himself, and wasn\u2019t interested in long term romance. \u201cI thrived in being by myself, in traveling by myself, in having dinner by myself \u2013 I loved all of that so much,\u201d says Guillermo, who lived in Boston, Massachusetts at the time. \u201cI wanted no commitment, I wanted no emotional entanglement of any kind. I wanted to have fun, get to know myself. And it was in that mode that I met Larry, when I wasn\u2019t really looking.\u201d During the vacation in Palm Springs, Guillermo was staying at a friend\u2019s apartment, and while the friend worked during the day, Guillermo passed his time at a \u201crun-down, no-frills\u201d resort a couple of blocks away. \u201cYou could just pay for a day pass, they\u2019d give you a towel, and you could be in the pool and use their bar,\u201d he recalls. One day, as he was walking the palm tree-lined streets to the resort, Guillermo swiped right on a guy on a dating app \u2013 Larry Mock, mid-40s, friendly smile. The two men exchanged a few messages back and forth. Larry said he was also on vacation in Palm Springs, staying in the resort Guillermo kept frequenting. They arranged to meet there for a drink by the pool. Guillermo was looking forward to meeting Larry, expecting \u201csome casual fun.\u201d Then, when Guillermo and Larry met, there was \u201cchemistry\u201d right away. Guillermo calls their connection \u201cmagnetic.\u201d \u201cMy impression of Larry: sexy, handsome and warm,\u201d he recalls. Larry was a Texas-based American Airlines flight attendant who\u2019d booked the vacation to Palm Springs at the last minute. He\u2019d recently broken up with a long-term partner but due to lease and budget reasons the two were still living together \u2013 awkwardly \u2013 in Dallas, Texas. Larry\u2019s workdays were spent traveling the world. But during his downtime, he struggled to relax in the apartment with his ex, and this sentiment motivated the spontaneous vacation. \u201cI needed to get out of town for the weekend, because we were just butting heads badly at that time,\u201d Larry tells CNN Travel today. Larry searched his airline\u2019s database, looking at destinations he could visit using the last minute, standby flight tickets available for flight attendants. \u201cPalm Springs had seats, so I booked my standby flight, got to Palm Springs, checked into this resort. And that\u2019s where Guillermo came into the picture,\u201d says Larry. Larry was instantly attracted to Guillermo. He thought he was \u201cjust the most handsome guy\u201d he\u2019d ever seen. And as they got chatting, and Guillermo kept making Larry laugh, Larry sketched out his first impression to include two more adjectives: \u201cso funny, and so kind.\u201d In passing, as the two flirted over pool-side cocktails, Larry mentioned that he was a flight attendant. Guillermo lit up. In fact, his response was \u201cgiddy,\u201d as Larry recalls it. \u201cHe started asking me tons of questions about planes, and flight attendants, and the routes and all of that kind of stuff.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a huge aviation geek,\u201d explains Guillermo. As a kid growing up in Costa Rica, he\u2019d wanted to be a pilot. Instead, he ended up working as an IT consultant. And while he says he was good at that job, liked it well enough and made good money \u2013 he still dreamed about working in aviation. Meeting a flight attendant was fascinating. \u201cI was immediately drawn to his career,\u201d says Guillermo. Larry found Guillermo\u2019s enthusiasm for aviation charming, and happily answered his questions. Later that evening, Larry and Guillermo said their goodbyes, with no plans to meet again. \u201cI was glad to meet him,\u201d says Larry. \u201cBut I was like, \u2018There\u2019s no way I am going to pursue dating somebody that lived in Boston.\u2019 And I still was dealing with what I was dealing with in Dallas.\u201d \u201cWe just really enjoyed the time that we had together,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cBut we went our separate ways.\u201d Unexpected moments Almost without realizing \u2013 and certainly without intending to \u2013 Guillermo and Larry stayed in touch. \u201cWe kept chatting, we kept texting,\u201d says Guillermo. Then, a few days after meeting Larry, Guillermo got an unexpected phone call from his mother in Costa Rica. He was still in Palm Springs at the time. \u201cShe said, \u2018I don\u2019t want you to freak out, but I just got diagnosed with breast cancer. I don\u2019t want you to change the trip.\u2019\u201d Guillermo tried to protest, but his mother insisted he should enjoy the rest of his vacation. She reassured him that her sisters and Guillermo\u2019s father were taking care of her, and she\u2019d see Guillermo later in the month \u2013 he already had a trip to Costa Rica scheduled for that summer. Not wanting to go against his mother\u2019s wishes, Guillermo stayed put in the desert. He tried to \u201ccompartmentalize\u201d the news, but he was really close to his mom, and it was cataclysmic. Later, back home in Boston, Guillermo found himself sharing his mother\u2019s news with Larry, and confiding in him about his fears and worries. He added that his mother lived in Costa Rica, so he\u2019d likely be flying back and forth for the rest of the year. Larry was supportive, empathetic \u2013 and he told Guillermo that he should use the discounted flights Larry got through work. Guillermo was taken aback \u2013 it was \u201csuch a sweet gesture\u201d from someone who was basically a stranger. But then, somehow, Larry already felt much more than that. \u201cVery early on, he and I had just beautiful interactions, and it revealed the kind of person that he was,\u201d he says. And so, rather than dwindling, Larry and Guillermo\u2019s communication increased as the days rolled on. \u201cWithin just a few weeks, we just knew \u2013 without much discussion, without talking about it \u2013 we just knew that there was a very, very strong connection there,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cWe always had something to talk about,\u201d says Larry. Larry was still hesitant about jumping into something new, following the breakdown of his previous relationship. But the messages back and forth with Guillermo became a highlight of his day. And as time passed, he found himself opening up to Guillermo, confiding in him. \u201cAfter a few months, I was like, \u2018Yes, this is exactly what I was looking for my whole life. Someone that I can be my authentic self with,\u2019\u201d says Larry. Long-distance dating In September 2013, two months after their Palm Springs meeting, Larry arranged to visit Guillermo in Boston. At Logan Airport, Larry came down the escalator and spotted Guillermo\u2019s face in the crowd. He was beaming, and started running towards Larry. Then, Guillermo \u201chugged me so hard,\u201d recalls Larry. He remembers thinking, \u201cOh my god, this is the one.\u201d Then Guillermo and Larry went to Boston\u2019s seaport district together, and found a sundrenched rooftop bar where they sat drinking beers. \u201cWe could see the planes approaching Logan, and it was just a sunny and perfect Boston day,\u201d recalls Guillermo. \u201cI remember that, like a picture, sitting by the edge \u2013 I remember the beer and I remember the planes.\u201d It was \u201cmagical,\u201d says Guillermo, but also slightly \u201csurreal.\u201d The Palm Springs encounter was so brief. He never thought he\u2019d see Larry again. And now here Larry was, sitting opposite him, in Guillermo\u2019s city. From there, Guillermo and Larry started dating cross-country. They took advantage of Larry\u2019s discounted flights. Sometimes Larry traveled to Boston, but usually Guillermo visited Larry in Dallas. Guillermo\u2019s love of flying meant that, for him, the four-hour journey across the country was part of the fun. \u201cI was in heaven,\u201d he says. \u201cJust the fact that I was getting to do something that I have always just loved - which is being on an airplane and going somewhere.\u201d Each Friday, as he packed his bag and headed to the airport, Guillermo would also be struck with \u201cexcitement\u201d at the thought of seeing Larry. And during these weekend visits, Guillermo and Larry grew accustomed to each other\u2019s habits, how they moved through their days, how they liked to spend their time. Guillermo got to know Larry\u2019s friends and got to know Dallas as a city. They spoke about their hopes, dreams, ambitions and families. Guillermo says it was obvious that they were \u201cvery aligned on the important aspects of life: how we view finances, closeness with families, politically and world views and enjoyment of the small things in life.\u201d Larry supported Guillermo as he cared for his mother through her cancer, and celebrated with him when she recovered. \u201cFor us, it was a gradual process of falling in love,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cBut a theme for us in our life together is that everything felt right and natural.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t pinpoint the moment, but we simply knew very deep in our hearts that we found the life partner.\u201d \u201cThat made me so happy,\u201d says Larry. For Guillermo, moving to Dallas two years later, in late 2015, was \u201cjust as the easiest decision.\u201d Larry was thrilled. His Dallas-based friendship group had already welcomed Guillermo into the fold, and his parents were happy for him too. \u201cI introduced Guillermo to everybody,\u201d says Larry. \u201cMy family\u2019s always been very accepting of me.\u201d Guillermo\u2019s family situation was more complicated. He\u2019s always been very close with his parents and siblings, but for the first two decades of his adult life, he didn\u2019t talk to his family about relationships. \u201cMy personal life was not necessarily an open book,\u201d Guillermo says. \u201cLove has never been the question - my parents love me, I love my parents and my sisters, we all get along great. But there was always that invisible barrier, which was: I don\u2019t talk about my personal relationships.\u201d But Guillermo didn\u2019t want to hide Larry from anyone - he felt he owed that to himself, and to Larry. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to edit myself, I wasn\u2019t going to filter. I just knew deep in my heart that it was my chance to be able to truly be myself,\u201d he says. So Guillermo started peppering his phone calls home with mentions of Larry. He uploaded cute photos of the two of them to social media. \u201cI\u2019m fearless,\u201d he told himself. \u201cNothing bad can happen here.\u201d A monumental year Cut to 2018, which was a monumental year for Guillermo and Larry for a couple of reasons. For one, it was the year Guillermo followed in Larry\u2019s footsteps and became a flight attendant. It was a mutual friend who suggested Guillermo should give it a shot, and Larry \u2013 who\u2019d spent years listening to Guillermo wax lyrical about airplanes \u2013 was wholeheartedly encouraging. Guillermo applied to Larry\u2019s airline, American Airlines, but wasn\u2019t accepted. But then he applied to Delta, and was accepted on the spot. While Guillermo and Larry loved the idea of working together, flying with different airlines also \u201cworked out great,\u201d says Guillermo. For one, there were two different sets of airline benefits to enjoy. And working in the air was everything Guillermo hoped it would be and more. \u201cI was doing my dream job, my childhood dream job,\u201d he says. \u201cI still have to pinch myself that actually, I am a flight attendant.\u201d 2018 was also the year Guillermo and Larry got married. Guillermo proposed to Larry on an airplane. The couple were flying back to Dallas after visiting San Francisco, where they\u2019d attended an Adele concert. As they were descending, the Dallas lights glistening out the airplane window, Guillermo suddenly felt the time was right. He turned to Larry and asked him to marry him. Larry smiled, and said yes. \u201cDespite it being impromptu, as an aviation geek, I love that I proposed on a flight,\u201d says Guillermo. The couple started planning their nuptials. Guillermo was excited, but he was unsure what role \u2013 if any \u2013 his family would play on the wedding day. While Guillermo had mentioned Larry to his parents, they still hadn\u2019t met him. This was partly because Guillermo\u2019s family were in Costa Rica, and partly because Guillermo wasn\u2019t sure how that meeting would play out. \u201cThe person that I had the most trouble with was my father \u2013 because he was the one that had the hardest time really accepting me,\u201d says Guillermo. As plans for the wedding started to take shape, Guillermo composed a long email to his father. \u201cI said something to the effect of, \u2018Hey Dad, I know I really haven\u2019t really talked much about any of my personal life. But I met this person, Larry, who is the love of my life. We are going to get married. Come, don\u2019t come, no problem. But I just need to tell you because this is probably one of the most important days and times of my life.\u2019\u201d Guillermo\u2019s father didn\u2019t attend the wedding. \u201cFor those reasons and also because he was towards the end of his life, his mobility was a problem,\u201d Guillermo says. \u201cBut my mom, my sisters, my niece and my nephew came, which was far more than I ever imagined or dreamed. That was such a great moment.\u201d Guillermo introduced his mother and sisters to Larry a couple of days before the wedding. They all gathered at a rooftop bar in Dallas, along with Guillermo and Larry\u2019s close friends. When Guillermo\u2019s mother saw Larry for the first time, she enveloped Larry in her arms. The two hit it off right away. Guillermo was overwhelmed with happiness. \u201cFor me, to see Larry and mom interact \u2013 they just love each other so much,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cAnd my sisters just cannot get enough of him \u2013 I just sit back, and just enjoy.\u201d A magical wedding day Guillermo and Larry\u2019s wedding took place at the Dallas Arboretum, a botanical garden. It was an outdoor wedding, and the couple woke up to the rain pouring and concerned texts from guests worried how the wedding would play out in a downpour. \u201cBut then, sure enough, out came the sun at the right time,\u201d recalls Guillermo. Larry and Guillermo wrote their own vows and read them to each other during the ceremony. Guillermo told Larry that he inspired him to be a better son, sibling, friend and person. \u201cYou want a partner that is going to challenge you to be better,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cI always feel that I want to be a better human being just in general, because he is such a figure in my life and everyone\u2019s life \u2013 he is the center of everybody\u2019s life.\u201d In turn, Larry promised Guillermo their married life would be \u201cexciting, adventurous and full of passion.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m proud to take you as my husband. I promise to fly with you to the ends of the earth,\u201d Larry said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to grow old together and look back at this beautiful moment.\u201d He ended the vows telling Guillermo: \u201cTe amo\u201d \u2013 Spanish for \u201cI love you.\u201d The reception was held at a local winery. During the celebrations, Guillermo and Larry danced to Rihanna\u2019s hit \u201cWe Found Love,\u201d which includes the lyric: \u201cWe found love in a hopeless place.\u201d The couple felt it was fitting \u2013 the resort they met at did seem a bit of a \u201chopeless place.\u201d And they never expected that brief meeting would lead to a lasting love. \u201cWe made sure that song was played, because we did find love in a hopeless place,\u201d says Larry. \u201cAnd I love Rihanna, too,\u201d says Guillermo. At one point, Guillermo and Larry walked through the reception doors holding hands, spontaneously lifting their arms in the air, a \u201cvictorious\u201d pose, as Guillermo put it. \u201cIt was just an electric effect,\u201d he says. The last piece of the puzzle A few years into their marriage, Guillermo and Larry visited Costa Rica together for the first time. Larry was excited to see Guillermo\u2019s home country, and Guillermo was excited to show his husband where he grew up \u2013 and the visit was also an opportunity for Larry to finally meet Guillermo\u2019s father. Guillermo was nervous about how the meeting would play out, but when he arrived at his parents\u2019 house with Larry in tow, Guillermo\u2019s father opened his arms and hugged Larry tightly. \u201cHe said, \u2018Welcome home,\u2019\u201d says Guillermo. It was a cathartic, emotional moment for everyone. \u201cI was so nervous that day, meeting the father-in-law,\u201d says Larry. \u201cAnd when he just said \u2018welcome home,\u2019 and hugged me, every bit of nerves went away. I felt comfortable, I felt welcomed, I felt loved.\u201d Larry says the moment felt like the \u201clast piece\u201d of a puzzle slotting into place. Guillermo was overjoyed. \u201cThat evening, which we got to spend \u2013 me, mom, dad, and Larry \u2013 was just a highlight,\u201d says Guillermo. The family played old records on a turntable. Guillermo and his mother danced in the living room, while Larry and Guillermo\u2019s father sipped cocktails and watched, laughing. \u201cI had to just step back, because you have to look at those moments and just kind of create a little mini movie of them,\u201d says Guillermo. Guillermo\u2019s father has since passed away, which makes Guillermo and Larry all the more grateful for that time together in Costa Rica. In general, a feeling of gratitude defines Guillermo and Larry\u2019s relationship \u2013 gratitude for each other and what they\u2019ve brought to one another\u2019s lives, and gratitude that their paths crossed over ten years ago. On their anniversary, the couple usually return to Palm Springs to celebrate the day they met. \u201cNot only is Palm Springs beautiful with a great vibe, but we love to go back and celebrate our meeting place,\u201d says Larry. \u201cWe weren\u2019t looking, neither one of us \u2013 but it did happen, and it\u2019s definitely for life.\u201d \u201cWhat a gift,\u201d says Guillermo, who says his life today is what he dreamed of \u201cas a little gay boy in Costa Rica, always loving the US, always loving airplanes, always envisioning that I would have a relationship where we are completely free to show our love.\u201d \u201cAnd we do, we do,\u201d he says. \u201cWho could ask for anything more?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/vacation-fling-love-story-chance-encounters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "travel"}}

{"id": "travel_harry-styles-holmes-chapel-tour", "text": "Before 2010, Holmes Chapel was but another quiet leafy village in northern England. There was the little train station with services to Manchester and Crewe, a handful of local shops and, a short walk out of town, the 180-year-old Twemlow Viaduct on the banks of the River Dane. Then a teenager with dimples and curly hair, who worked part-time at the local bakery, went down to London to audition for \u201cThe X Factor\u201d TV show. That teen was Harry Styles, who became part of bestselling boy band One Direction before scaling new heights with his solo career. Holmes Chapel\u2019s fame began when it appeared in the 2013 One Direction documentary \u201cThis Is Us\u201d and, for Styles\u2019 legions of dedicated fans around the world \u2013 known as \u201cHarries\u201d \u2013 his youthful haunts were anointed as new shrines on a pop pilgrimage. The prime destination is the viaduct, where the pop star had his first kiss and, in the documentary, wrote his name on the wall in chalk. But, say locals, with an estimated 5,000 international fans visiting the 6,700-population village each year, road safety has become a concern. Harry Styles rescued a baby mole So, a year on from introducing a free map with safe walking routes around the village, the Holmes Chapel Partnership community group has this weekend launched Harry\u2019s Home Village Tour. It\u2019s a leisurely 2.5-to-three-hour stroll around Harry hotspots \u2013 allowing plenty of time for selfies and social content \u2013 guided by trained experts in both local history and Harry lore, some of whom share stories of their brushes with the man himself. \u201cMy favorite Harry Styles memory was when he helped me rescue a baby mole that my cats had brought into the house, and it had burrowed underneath the carpet,\u201d recalls tour guide Jill Booth, 58, who, as a former neighbor with a son the same age, has known Styles since he was a young child. There were 150 applicants for the tour guide roles, many from overseas, and the interview process involved an 80-question quiz on both the star and his home town, as well as a trial presentation at the viaduct. Other guides, such as 21-year-old Isabella Boughey from nearby Stoke-on-Trent, are from the Harry fanbase. As a child, Boughey watched \u201cThe X Factor\u201d with her mother and he\u2019s held a special place in her heart ever since. \u201cI just love how he embodies happiness and positivity,\u201d she tells CNN Travel. \u2018The best job in the world\u2019 The tour starts at Holmes Chapel train station, where station master Graham Blake has for years been welcoming fans who\u2019ve traveled from everywhere from Australia to Mexico and beyond. Blake remembers Styles being at the station weekly as he traveled down to London as he got through the stages of \u201cThe X Factor\u201d reality show. He was a \u201clovely lad,\u201d he recalls. \u201cHe was always ahead with the fashion and everything. He\u2019d wear these jeans with his Calvin Klein boxers and his little bobbly hat.\u201d He shows us the sixth edition of the train station\u2019s visitor book, which is overflowing with heartfelt messages from fans. Harry Styles\u2019 father Des stops by from time to time to pick up the completed books to pass onto his son. Of his role as a mentor to Harry fans, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s made my job the best job in the world now, because I get to meet people from all over the world who come in and have a chat.\u201d The ticket office is bedecked with Harry Styles-themed memorabilia, including a lifesize cutout, and another 2D Harry greets us at W. Mandeville bakery, where staff and customers alike aren\u2019t fazed by the press scrum, plainly accustomed to the village\u2019s new-found fame. In shop windows there are Harry Styles coloring books; bars advertise \u201cWatermelon Sugar\u201d cocktails. It\u2019\u2019d be a tough town for any locals with Styles fatigue. Navigating the English countryside After picking up doughy treats in W. Mandeville, fans have been known to attempt to meander down to the Twemlow Viaduct along the busy A305 road, where cars travel at 50 miles per hour and there are no sidewalks. The safer route, and the one Harry Styles and other local children would have taken, is an idyllic jaunt through green fields and along the river. And on the way to the viaduct, visitors would also do well to have an understanding of the Countryside Code of England and Wales, with its guidance on navigating private land and local livestock. It\u2019s busy at the viaduct while we are there, our tour group clutching the slate hearts we\u2019ve been given to write messages on, to discourage adding to the Harry-inspired graffiti that covers the brickwork. It doesn\u2019t dissuade a herd of cattle from wandering among us, at risk of trampling the blanket upon which fans are sat making friendship bracelets. Friends Phoebe Hodges and Mia Tesolin, both 18, have traveled from Canberra, Australia, to see Harry Styles\u2019 hometown. \u201cI like all the greenery and all the houses,\u201d says Hodges. Tesolin agrees, \u201cThe scenery is definitely really beautiful.\u201d The tour has yet to be officially endorsed by Harry Styles himself, although Peter Whiers, chair of the Holmes Chapel Partnership, tells CNN that they\u2019ve reached out to his management team via his mother. (CNN has also contacted his music label for comment.) This isn\u2019t the first time Whiers has been linked to Styles through road safety. \u201cI probably oversaw his cycling skills when he was about 10,\u201d he says, having been in charge of preparing children from his school for their cycling proficiency test, a national bike safety program. \u2018Messages of love\u2019 One location that the tour doesn\u2019t take in is the newly reopened Fortune City Chinese restaurant, which \u2013 when we peer in through the darkened windows on a Friday afternoon \u2013 resembles any other small-town dining spot. It is, however, where 18-year-old Harry Styles took his then girlfriend, 23-year-old Taylor Swift, for a date way back in 2012. A photo capturing the moment was shared on Twitter at the time, with Styles looking considerably more enthusiastic about the night out than Swift. Whiers tells CNN that the fan base is predominantly girls and young women and that they\u2019re \u201cgenerally very respectful.\u201d \u201cI think, when you look at the messages that they write in Graham\u2019s book at the station and also the messages they leave on the wall, they\u2019re all messages of love,\u201d he says. The Harry Styles song \u201cTreat People with Kindness\u201d has been picked up as a mantra by fans and our tour around Holmes Chapel has been notably wholesome. The price of the tour, \u00a320 ($25), feels steep, but the partnership only introduced it after first producing free walking maps. The tour maps come with discounts to local businesses and they\u2019re hoping for a hot trade in tour t-shirts. From Japan to Austria to the Balearics, there are small communities in revolt against their villages being taken over by tourists. When life gives you lemons, make lemonade. In Holmes Chapel, when life gave them watermelons, they made watermelon sugar.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/harry-styles-holmes-chapel-tour/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_stigull-floating-ladder-norway", "text": "A new \u201cfloating\u201d staircase in Norway promises spectacular views and undeniable thrills \u2013 but it\u2019s probably not for the fainthearted. The 131-foot long stairway, called the \u201cStigull\u201d ladder, dangles some 2,591 feet above a Norwegian fjord in the small village of Loen, in the north west of the country. \u201cIt might make most people\u2019s legs tremble a bit,\u201d the man behind the ladder, Per Helge B\u00f8, tells CNN Travel. Seen from Loen\u2019s nearby Gj\u00f8lmunne suspension bridge, \u201cit looks like people are floating in the air,\u201d says Helge B\u00f8. A ladder in the sky Helge B\u00f8 is the operations manager at Loen Active, the company behind this and several outdoor activities based in around Loen, a village in the heart of the Nordfjord region known for its striking landscapes. The 120-step ladder is the latest addition to Loen\u2019s adrenaline-junkie scene, forming part of the village\u2019s extensive via ferrata climbing route. Via ferrata, which directly translates from Italian to English as \u201ciron path,\u201d is a term used to describe mountain climbing routes that use steel cables and fixed ladders to aid climbers. The Loen Stigull ladder \u2013 which is at a 45-degree angle \u2013\u00a0 is only accessible to climbers who\u2019ve already partly ascended the via ferrata route towards the top of Loen\u2019s Mount Hoven. This means even when you start climbing the ladder, you\u2019ll already be pretty high up. Pretty terrifying \u2013 but if you can stomach the dizzying heights, Helge B\u00f8 promises the views are worth it \u2013 think glistening blue water, framed by mountains and clouds. \u201cIf you dare to look around, you can take in the spectacular fjord landscape with the glittering fjord and the majestic peaks, with the massive cliff face and narrow gorge right beside you,\u201d says Helge B\u00f8. And when you make it to the top of Mount Hoven, you\u2019ll be rewarded not only with more jaw-dropping views, but also a restaurant to grab a bite to eat, and a cable car that\u2019ll take you back down to ground level in five minutes. Helge B\u00f8, who oversaw the stairwell\u2019s building process by Austrian company HZI, hopes the ladder will become a big summer 2024 attraction in the Nordfjord region. Visitors have the option of embarking on Via Ferrata Loen with or without a guide, depending on their experience level. Prices for climbing with a guide start at 1,695 Norwegian Krone (around $160) for adults. Kids over 12 are also welcome to join guided tours for 1,535 Norwegian Krone (around $145). Visitors can also book other activities including kayaking, stand-up paddle boarding and a ride on the Mount Hoven zipline. For those embarking on the via ferrata route, there are several measures in place to ensure climbers\u2019 safety. \u201cAll climbing in Via Ferrata Loen, including the Stigull, takes place while you are securely attached to a wire,\u201d explains Helge B\u00f8. And while the staircase looks intimidating, Helge B\u00f8 says it\u2019s suitable for anyone with a decent level of fitness and, according to him at least, it\u2019s \u201cnot particularly demanding.\u201d He hopes it\u2019ll attract more visitors to the already popular Loen region. \u201cClimbing the ladder itself is not difficult, but the exposure and the sense of accomplishment you feel when climbing there are immense,\u201d he says.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/stigull-floating-ladder-norway/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_sambuca-sicily-cheap-homes-three-euros", "text": "Dwindling Italian towns have been pulling out all the stops to lure new residents in recent years, with several one-euro home schemes launching across the country. But while some towns have struggled to find buyers for their abandoned buildings, others have been basking in the glory of successful sales. After seeing huge demand for its previous home sell offs in 2019 and 2021, Sicily\u2019s Sambuca di Sicilia is preparing to put a third batch under the hammer, this time with starting prices of 3 euros, or just over $3. Previous success \u201cWe just want to make it clear that by numbering these batches, more sales will likely follow in coming years,\u201d newly elected mayor Giuseppe Cacioppo tells CNN. \u201cForeigners are flocking to buy our homes, it\u2019s been a hit so far.\u201d Cacioppo encourages potential buyers who are heading to the region to pay the town a visit and check out the 12 or so homes up for grabs this time. \u201cThe timing is perfect,\u201d he says. \u201cTourists and interested buyers currently traveling to Italy, and those planning a trip in spring and summer can come take a look.\u201d According to Cacioppo, the available homes, located in the old Saracen district, are as \u201cstructurally stable as those so far sold\u201d but in need of a restyle. Sambuca made global headlines back in 2019 when CNN announced that it was putting 16 dwellings up for sale for\u00a0one euro. Two years later, the town offered up a second batch of homes for two euros. The fire-sale, which lured international buyers as far as the Middle East, has helped to revamp the local economy with an influx of 20 million euros (around $21.8 million,) says Cacioppo. This includes turnover from new B&Bs, new shops that have opened in the town and contracts with builders, architects, surveyors, interior designers and notaries. \u201cThe two batches of houses, owned by the town hall, revitalized the private real estate sector. People rushing to grab one at auction but didn\u2019t make the final cut bought a cheap house instead. So far, 250 homes have been sold,\u201d says Cacioppo. Sambuca\u2019s triumphant efforts to sell off its empty homes are largely credited to the fact that the local authorities actually own the abandoned dwellings they hope to offload. Other depopulated Italian towns, such as medieval village Patrica, located south of Rome, have attempted to launch similar schemes, but struggled to track down the former owners to gain permission to sell their empty homes. Revival hopes Sambuca\u2019s authorities took possession of the town\u2019s abandoned houses after an earthquake struck the surrounding Belice Valley in 1969. The natural disaster sent locals fleeing, leaving behind empty homes. \u201cRome\u2019s government back then approved a specific law for Sambuca\u2019s revival that granted the town hall ownership of the abandoned homes, so we can dispose of these as we wish, and there are no middle agencies,\u201d says Cacioppo. This means that the sale process is much faster, as the local authorities don\u2019t need to liaise between owners and buyers. The homes on offer this time consist of single, two to three-bedroom 50 to 80 square-meter houses built with golden-brownish stones and spread over one or three floors. Many have iron-wrought balconies overlooking cobbled alleys and panoramic terraces, as well as original green-painted old wooden doors with decorated arches and windows. Those in the best condition feature tiny internal Moorish courtyards with lemon trees and old painted majolica tile floors. But most are badly in need of repair and filled with forgotten items and piles of broken, dusty furniture. Depending on the condition of the property, restyles usually start at \u20ac30,000 (around $32,500) for a simple makeover, but can rise to over \u20ac200,000 (roughly ($217,000) if buyers plan to turn the house into a luxury retreat. One American couple who purchased a bargain home in the town went on to add an internal elevator. Many of those buyers who won the previous bids eventually ended up buying more properties in town. These were often attached homes, which meant that they could be expanded into one big property. High demand Keen to cash-in on the high demand, locals have rushed to sell off garages or old abandoned attics. Most of the people who\u2019ve been lured to this remote spot in Sicily, situated far from the touristy crowds, are from the US. This has helped to create a \u201cLittle America,\u201d with most residents now speaking some English with a Sicilian accent, even the elders. Foreigners may have been a rare sight here before 2019, but they\u2019ve become part of the landscape now, jokes Cacioppo, with a significant expat community now calling Sambuca home. Last year, the town hall opened remote-working spaces to lure global digital workers, offering free stays and strengthening its Wi-Fi connection throughout the narrow alleys. \u201cOur town is now definitely on the map,\u201d says Cacioppo. The Sambuca homes going up for auction in this latest scheme will be sold to the highest bidder, with the winning bid placed in a sealed envelope and opened in front of a judge after the application deadline. Those taking part in the auction are required to pay a deposit guarantee of 5,000 euros (around $5,430). If they lose the bid, the sum will immediately be returned to them. But if they win, the 5,000 euros will automatically become their deposit guarantee. The rules of the scheme stipulate that buyers must have completed the renovation work on their homes within three years, or risk losing their deposit guarantee. However, the town hall has so far been flexible on deadlines due to the pandemic, allowing more time to complete the works during and after the Covid-19 pandemic. In the previous sales, houses were eventually sold at prices between 1 and 25,000 euros (roughly $27,133,) with most going for between 5,000 euros (around $5,426) to 10,000 euros. Interested applicants can find photos and descriptions of the available homes, along with   application forms, on the town hall\u2019s official website.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/sambuca-sicily-cheap-homes-three-euros/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "travel"}}

The tiny sugar glider \u2013 a nocturnal animal resembling a flying squirrel \u2013\u00a0 broke loose on a China Eastern Airlines flight on Monday, scurrying away from its owner, hiding in the cabin and eventually forcing passengers to temporarily disembark the plane. \u201cOn a flight from Shanghai to Jinan on June 10, 2024, a passenger surnamed Guo (female, 34 years old) violated the regulations and took a pet sugar glider on board the plane,\u201d Shanghai Police International Airport Branch said in a statement on its Weibo social media account. \u201cThe pet escaped in the cabin and was captured by others.\u201d Chinese local media said the incident took place on flight MU5599 from Shanghai\u2019s Hongqiao International Airport. Videos posted on social media appear to show a flight attendant kneeling on the ground and looking for the furry fugitive. It was reported that all the passengers were eventually made to disembark the plane and wait in the terminal building until the creature was captured. Social videos reposted by local media show passengers gathered in front of a counter at the airport negotiating with airline staff.

The 3,000-room resort will cease operations on July 17 as it undergoes a three-year renovation that wipes away any markings of the Mirage and its tropical theme. Opened in 1989 by casino mogul Steve Wynn, the Mirage ushered in a era of luxe resorts for the Strip and was the first resort to have a sidewalk attraction with its volcano, prompting the Bellagio and Venetian to imitate the Mirage with its dancing fountains and canals, respectively. \u201cWe look forward to the beginning of an exciting journey into a new era as Hard Rock Las Vegas will ignite the Strip with entertainment, innovation and world-class hospitality,\u201d the Mirage said on its Facebook account, which has been flooded with memories in the comments. In addition to the volcano, the Mirage was also home to other quintessential Las Vegas features like the Siegfried and Roy\u2019s white tigers show and a Cirque du Soleil show set to Beatles music. The resort will reopen in 2027 as Hard Rock Las Vegas, with a soaring 700-foot-tall hotel tower in the shape of a guitar, similar to its Florida property, with the volcano being destroyed to make space for new rooms. MGM Resorts bought the Mirage from Wynn in 2000 and sold it in 2022 for more than $1 billion to Hard Rock International. It\u2019s the second time Hard Rock will have a presence in Las Vegas, with the brand previously owning the now-Virgin Hotel off the Strip. More than 3,000 Mirage employees will be laid off beginning in July. The Hard Rock said it will pay more than $80 million in severance. The Culinary Workers Union, which represents about half of the Mirage\u2019s employees, said in a statement that affected workers will get $2,000 for each year of employment with the option of returning when the hotel reopens. Mirage guests that have reservations beyond July 14 will be cancelled and refunds issued. As for casino chips, they also need to be used by that date at the Mirage but can be redeemed at neighboring Treasure Island for another 120 days following the resort\u2019s closing.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/business/mirage-las-vegas-closing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_lgbtq-travel-destinations-homosexuality-criminalized", "text": "When Emma-Jane Nutbrown went on a family vacation to Jamaica last year, she did so with one condition: that everyone donated to an LGBTQ charity once they got there. Nutbrown felt uncomfortable with her parents\u2019 choice of destination. Same-sex sexual activity between men is against the law in Jamaica and carries a maximum jail term of 10 years with hard labor. Both Nutbrown and her brother, Simon \u2013 whose 40th birthday the family was celebrating on that trip \u2013 are gay. \u201cIt made Simon uneasy going there, but most people like to travel for the place, not the politics behind it, so we couldn\u2019t really hold my parents accountable,\u201d says Nutbrown, founder of Queer Edge, which creates safe spaces for the community in London. \u201cI won\u2019t refuse to travel somewhere with family, but I will raise it.\u00a0So instead of us refusing to go, Simon made everyone donate to a charity out there as his birthday present.\u201d Nutbrown and her brother are some of the millions worldwide who have an extra layer to consider when booking a vacation: Will they be safe in the destination, and how are local members of the LGBTQ community treated? \u201cI\u2019m predominantly against it [travel to destinations where homosexuality is banned], but I\u2019m pragmatic. It\u2019s not as easy as \u2018Don\u2019t go,\u2019 \u201d she says. \u201cIf there was a shared consensus across the planet [to boycott destinations] then it would work, but I think it\u2019s a lot more complex.\u201d There are 62 countries worldwide that still criminalize (or de facto criminalize) homosexuality, according to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA), which counts UN member states. The Human Dignity Trust counts 64. Of these, 12 could potentially impose the death penalty for same-sex activity, including tourist favorite the United Arab Emirates; Qatar, whose airline was this week deemed the best in the world; Nigeria, which welcomed the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in May; and Saudi Arabia, which last year claimed that it welcomed LGBTQ travelers. Many people \u2013 even those outside the LGBTQ community \u2013 simply will not travel to countries where homosexuality is illegal. Corey O\u2019Neill, an office manager from London, is one. \u201cSafety is at the forefront of anyone\u2019s mind when traveling,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if you\u2019re not visibly queer, there\u2019s an innate danger that how you act might be perceived as gay, which entails not only formal punishments, but police brutality, hate crimes, the general atmosphere. I don\u2019t want to have that in my mind on vacation.\u201d O\u2019Neill\u2019s stance means that unless laws change, he will never see the pyramids (Egypt has de-facto criminalized homosexuality with jail-term punishment); sleep overwater in the Maldives (up to eight years jail-time plus 100 lashes); take a Kenyan safari (maximum 14 years imprisonment); see Red Square (Russia designates the LGBTQ movement \u2013 even displaying a rainbow flag \u2013 as \u2018extremist\u2019 with up to 12-year sentences); or stop over in Qatar (up to 10 years in prison, with \u201cno legal certainty\u201d over a potential death penalty). But he\u2019s OK with that. \u201cWhy would I give money to a country that doesn\u2019t want me to exist? Even if $10 went towards a tax that actively harmed people, that\u2019d be my money I gave them.\u201d It\u2019s not just LGBTQ people who feel this way. Members and allies of the community are currently in their 10th year of boycotting the Dorchester Collection hotels, owned by the Brunei Investment Agency (part of the Ministry of Finance and Economy), since the country introduced laws authorizing the stoning to death of LGBTQ people, as well as the public flogging of women for adultery. In 2019, George Clooney wrote of the importance of boycotting. But while a boycott may be possible against a business, some feel that swerving an entire country harms the local community even more. \u201cIt can cause a very visceral reaction in people, but there are 50 shades of discrimination, and the challenge is where you draw the line,\u201d says Darren Burn, founder of inclusive travel companies Out of Office and TravelGay. \u201cWould you go somewhere you can\u2019t get married, or can\u2019t go into the army? The reality is there are loads of places where, even if it\u2019s not illegal to be gay, there are challenges. I totally respect that some people don\u2019t want to support an economy where [homosexuality] is illegal. But the other side is that I want to go, and by going, I\u2019m helping to change mindsets. Every country has gay people. We hear from staff members and locals in destinations, who say, \u2018Please come.\u2019 \u201d Burn never planned to enter the travel industry. He was a journalist when he went on holiday to Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt. \u201cI was in my early 20s, and I was a bit na\u00efve. It was Sharm \u2013 a tourist haven,\u201d he says. \u201cI was traveling with my ex, and we weren\u2019t allowed to check in. We had to go to another hotel. I thought, that shouldn\u2019t happen to anyone, ever.\u201d In 2016, he founded Out of Office, building a contact book of \u201cwelcoming suppliers and tour guides.\u201d \u2018Do you need two beds?\u2019 In recent years, destination marketers have become more vociferous in attracting LGBTQ clients. There\u2019s usually a financial reason behind it, says Burn. Travelers from the community \u201care less likely to have children and more likely to have disposable income. They\u2019re loyal customers and trust word-of-mouth referrals.\u201d Sherwin Banda, president of luxury safari provider African Travel Inc says that the LGBTQ community has \u201cthe largest disposable income of any other niche market.\u201d \u201cA destination\u2019s reputation as being LGBT-friendly is a primary motivation for us,\u201d he says. A 2021 report from nonprofit Open for Business showed that Caribbean nations outlawing homosexuality saw their GDP hit by up to 5.7% and lost the tourist industry $423 million to $689 million annually. In Jamaica,\u00a0tourism officials\u00a0have tried to downplay the impact of the island nation\u2019s laws against homosexuality. In 2022, legislation was repealed in Barbados, Antigua and Barbuda, and St. Kitts and Nevis. Trinidad and Tobago had already decriminalized same-sex relations in 2018; in April 2024, Dominica followed suit. \u201cThe Caribbean is moving quite quickly,\u201d says Burn, who adds that the anti-homosexuality laws in many Caribbean and African countries were established under European colonialism. Banda, who is South African, agrees. \u201cColonial laws combined with stringent religious beliefs have prolonged a stigma attached to homosexuality across Africa,\u201d he says. However, he is still comfortable arranging safaris for LGBTQ travelers. \u201cOnce we know travelers are from the community, we take great care to ensure guides, hotels, all the touchpoints throughout the journey are safe for them, but also inclusive,\u201d he says. \u201cNobody will say, \u2018Do you need two beds?\u2019 We ensure our clients don\u2019t have to come out again to everyone they meet in Africa.\u201d \u2018Tolerance is practiced not preached\u2019 The experience on the ground is often different from the letter of the law. As Burn says, \u201cIt\u2019s also illegal to drink alcohol in the Maldives, but all resorts have it.\u201d (He advises not holding hands at the airport, however.) In 2020, Bilal El Hammoumy and Rania Chentouf launched Inclusive Morocco, the first LGBT-founded tour operator in a country that punishes same-sex activity with up to three years in jail. \u201cBeing members of the community, we felt we would understand better how to approach it,\u201d says El Hammoumy. \u201cMorocco is a country where tolerance is practiced but not preached. \u201cWe could understand clients\u2019 fears, but on the other hand, it was important to create a space where the local LGBT community can be involved in training programs and hiring opportunities.\u201d El Hammoumy says that in Morocco, \u201cthe reality is a bit different from the law.\u201d In the early 20th century, cities such as Tangier were \u201cgay heavens\u201d for creatives escaping conservative Western countries. One of Marrakech\u2019s main sights is the Majorelle Garden, where the ashes of former owner Yves Saint Laurent were scattered by his former partner, Pierre Berg\u00e9. El Hammoumy says that Moroccan hotels are generally accepting of same-sex couples, but those they work with have extra training to ensure travelers are comfortable. Some guides have opted not to work with them when they explain their clientele, he says. However, he says that visiting destinations can change mindsets. \u201cA lot of anti-LGBT feelings come from prejudice and a lack of education, and direct contact can change preconceived ideas about the community,\u201d he says. Burn agrees. There\u2019s the economic incentive, too. Banda, who grew up under apartheid, believes that South Africa would not have changed without economic pressure from the wider world. \u201cTravel does something no other industry can do,\u201d he says. \u201cAfrica is heavily dependent on tourism dollars. We can advocate for inclusivity with partners who are prepared to actively welcome our guests. If we stay away, we lose that opportunity to use our voice.\u201d Travel can \u2018bring change\u2019 Does that mean every country should be showered in travel dollars in a bid to change opinions? Not according to these experts, none of whom would send a client to Saudi Arabia. Uganda is another sticking point \u2013 its 2023 Anti-Homosexuality Act legalized the targeting of the LGBTQ community in myriad ways and even carries the death sentence. \u201cAs a company, you need to stand for something, and Uganda advocates for brutal violent acts against gay people. We cannot in good conscience send people there,\u201d says Banda. Michael Kajubi has a different perspective. In 2013 he founded McBern Tours, curating Uganda tours, after being fired from his previous job because of \u201csuspicions\u201d that he was gay. \u201cI had to start a company to employ myself and people like me who could not get jobs because of who they are,\u201d he says. The majority of McBern staff are LGBTQ, and all profits go to the McBern Foundation, which supports elderly Ugandans and marginalized youths. Kajubi \u2013 who left Uganda four years ago because of his activism \u2013 says that he is still comfortable sending LGBTQ travelers there, as long as they \u201crespect the laws \u2013 don\u2019t wave their rainbow flag all over the place.\u201d All the hotels that McBern uses \u2013 even for straight guests \u2013 have been carefully vetted as LGBTQ-friendly, says Kajubi. He believes travelers should still visit these destinations but be vigilant where their money is going. He suggests looking for tour operators affiliated to the IGLTA, so that you can be sure you\u2019re not funding inequality. Boycotting leaves the local community stranded, he argues. Companies that have stopped working with McBern because of Uganda\u2019s anti-gay legislation \u201chave a valid point, but supporting local companies can bring change. You\u2019re paying salaries for people who wouldn\u2019t otherwise be employed.  \u201cIf people don\u2019t come we can\u2019t support [Foundation] beneficiaries with healthcare, tuition and basic needs.\u201d \u2018Discrimination all over the place\u2019 Of course, discrimination isn\u2019t confined to countries where homosexuality is illegal. For starters, over 500 anti-LGBTQ laws were introduced in US state legislatures last year alone. In May, the US State Department issued a worldwide alert about potential attacks on LGBTQ+ people and events. In 2014, Matthieu Jost founded MisterB&B, an LGBTQ travel community with 1.3 million members, after an Airbnb host in Barcelona made it clear that he and his partner were unwelcome. Previously, a French hotel had refused him and his then-boyfriend a double bed. \u201cThis kind of discrimination is all over the place, even in 2024,\u201d says Jost, who won\u2019t even hold hands with his partner in Paris. Banda won\u2019t do that in Los Angeles, either. For Jost, traveling to a country where homosexuality is banned means abiding by local rules. MisterB&B users are not allowed to book travel in a country with the death penalty for same-sex behavior. In a destination where it\u2019s illegal, users are flagged before booking. \u201cWe warn travelers they need to be cautious. Ask for separate beds, don\u2019t show personal gestures, let family know where they\u2019re traveling and have the embassy contact,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you really want to go there, you need to respect the laws and religion of these countries and play the game.\u201d Burn adds that booking with a specialist is essential \u2013 his staff have mystery-shopped mainstream tour operators and found them lacking in knowledge, he says. For O\u2019Neill, and many like him, it\u2019s not enough. \u201cI know it limits where I can go \u2013 I\u2019ll probably never see the pyramids or go on safari. But there are so many beautiful places in the world that support queer people. That sounds like a much nicer vacation to me.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/lgbtq-travel-destinations-homosexuality-criminalized/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "travel"}}

Bette inspired generations of flight attendants. Fly high, Bette.\u201d The Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA), the union representing flight attendants in the United States, posted its own tribute to Nash on Facebook. \u201cBette\u2019s remarkable career spanned over six decades, during which she touched countless lives with her warmth, dedication and unparalleled service,\u201d said the post. \u201cHer passion for flying and her commitment to her passengers were truly inspiring. Bette\u2019s legacy will forever be remembered in the aviation community and by all who had the privilege of knowing her.\u201d Nash started her lifelong career with the now-defunct Eastern Airlines in Washington, DC, on November 4, 1957. In 2016, CNN had an opportunity to fly with her on her daily route from Reagan Washington National to Boston Logan on American Airlines. Nash, who was 80 at the time, said the romance and glamor of flying initially attracted her to the job. \u201cI wanted to be a flight attendant from the time I got on the first airplane \u2013 I was 16 years old, I was sitting with my mother on a green leather couch at Washington [Reagan National Airport], and this crew came up from TWA,\u201d she recalled. \u201cThe pilot and the flight attendant walked across the hall and I thought \u2018Oh my God,\u2019 and I said that was for me.\u201d Nash said she went on to get a college degree, but she never deviated from her dream. She applied for a job as a stewardess, as flight attendants were then known, shortly after graduating. \u201cAnd the rest is history,\u201d she told CNN with a big smile. According to ABC News,\u00a0Nash never officially retired from her role with American Airlines and died on May 17 in hospice care. From blackboards to tablets, Nash has seen it all Nash was awarded the Guinness World Record for having the longest career as a flight attendant in early 2022. \u201cHer career surpasses the last longest flight attendant with 63 years, 61 days as of January 4, 2021,\u201d said the Guinness announcement. Nash saw many changes in the world of aviation over those six-plus decades of flight, telling CNN planes were places of luxury when she started flying, a time when everyone wore their Sunday best and ate lobster on real china. \u201cYou worked harder physically in those days,\u201d said Nash. \u201cWe served this big meal tray. And I was the only one on the plane, so I had to take care of everybody.\u201d But the biggest changes she witnessed over the years related to technology. When Nash first began flying, all flight schedules were chalked up on a blackboard, and manuals and regulations came in book form. Eventually, those papers were replaced with tablets \u2013 which she says was a big adjustment. \u201cTechnology really made the difference of, \u2018Am I going to stay or am I going to go?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut even when I think I might retire or something, then I come to work and think, \u2018Oh, I couldn\u2019t do that.\u2019 It\u2019s stimulating coming out here.

{"id": "travel_chinese-food-evolution-french-polynesia", "text": "It\u2019s a cloudless morning and the sun is shining brightly off the coast of French Polynesia\u2019s capital and largest city, Papeete, enhancing the water\u2019s already vibrant shades of blue. Though just meters away from the territory\u2019s largest commercial port, cruise ship terminal and airport, the water is clean and clear, amplified by the presence of kaleidoscopic coral and a diverse array of marine creatures. My spearfishing guide is scouring the coral reefs for anything that might make for a delicious meal, but I\u2019m hoping we catch some tuna, mackerel or parrotfish to make\u00a0poisson cru \u00e0 la chinoise,\u00a0a Chinese take on French Polynesia\u2019s national dish, poisson cru au lait de coco\u00a0(lime-marinated raw fish with coconut milk). Both versions of the national dish are as ubiquitous as they are delicious, but the popularity of the chinoise version poses an interesting question: How did Chinese food become one of this French territory\u2019s favorite cuisines? Forging new lives, thousands of miles from home According to historical accounts, the first group of Chinese immigrants, primarily of the Hakka and Punti ethnicities, arrived in French Polynesia in 1865. The majority were brought from China\u2019s Guangdong province to work on a cotton plantation in Atimaono, located on the south side of French Polynesia\u2019s main island, Tahiti. But in 1873, the owner of the plantation died; just one year later, his cotton company went bankrupt. Being more than 11,000 kilometers from home and having little money, many of those Chinese workers remained in French Polynesia to forge new lives. Some continued farming on the defunct plantation, others opened small shops and eateries throughout the archipelago. From these humble beginnings, the Chinese population has grown to become an integral part of French Polynesa\u2019s business sector. Chinese is now the country\u2019s second-largest ethnic group, accounting for more than 10% of the overseas territory\u2019s population. Early on, Chinese cooks had to adapt to what was available in French Polynesia, utilizing more fresh seafood, fruits like coconut and breadfruit, and staples like taro instead of rice. Soy and oyster sauces, along with other ingredients needed for more complex Chinese cooking, would become more readily available only with later waves of immigration from China in the early to mid-1900s, says an article in the Journal of Pacific History. This relatively slow pace of culinary evolution would also give local Tahitians\u2019 palates more time to become accustomed to more flavorful food; before the Chinese arrived, Tahitian cuisine was very simple and predominantly seasoned with just a few ingredients, such as salt, pepper, lime, onions and coconut milk. It\u2019s hard to picture exactly what early Tahitian-Chinese food may have looked like or tasted like, especially with\u00a0the prevalence of Chinese ingredients on grocery store shelves today. Thankfully, one relic of early Chinese-Tahitian cooking has stood the test of time. Ma\u2019a Tinito, literally meaning \u201cChinese food\u201d in the Tahitian language, is also the name of a dish that\u2019s considered one of the region\u2019s earliest Chinese culinary creations. According to research by the Sinitong Association, which oversees the local Chinese cultural associations of French Polynesia, it was invented by a Chinese kitchen assistant in the tiny district of Atimaono. The story goes that the cook, short on ingredients, had to improvise to quickly satiate the hungry stomachs of the area\u2019s plantation workers. In his storeroom, he found red beans and salted pork, and then to add a bit of color to the dish, he fetched some bok choy (Chinese cabbage) and long beans from the vegetable garden. Curious locals asked the workers, \u201cWhat are you eating?\u201d The workers replied: \u201cMa\u2019a Tinito!\u201d (Chinese food!) Easy to cook, cheap, delicious and easily adaptable, the dish, and its name, were here to stay. An extra dose of sweetness A surefire way to immerse yourself not only in the flavors, but also in the culture of Chinese-Tahitian cuisine, is to sign up for a food tour. \u201cOur Chinese food is about family and friends,\u201d says Orama Mollimard, founder of the local food tour and travel company Tahiti With Me. \u201cIt\u2019s something that is meant to be shared and appreciated with everyone at the table.\u201d Having had almost two years of experience as a food tour guide, Orama decided to found her own company in 2024, so that she could share her favorite eats with new friends from around the world. Her Papeete food tour highlights Chinese-Tahitian snacks as an ode to her own Chinese-Tahitian heritage. Hungry foodies can look forward to a few of Orama\u2019s personal favorites, such as steamed chicken rice balls, Chinese-style fish beignets and plum-powdered mangoes. When trying one of Orama\u2019s recommended versions of\u00a0poisson cru \u00e0 la chinoise, those familiar with how raw fish is served in China might draw some connections between the two. Y\u00fash\u0113ng, meaning \u201craw fish\u201d in Chinese, is a popular yet relatively simple dish that generally consists of raw fish slices and an accompanying savory, sour and sometimes spicy sauce. This delicacy has been eaten for thousands of years in China, and has been brought by the Chinese diasporas to all parts of the globe. One can easily imagine Chinese immigrants in the late 1800s or early 1900s experimenting with different combinations of flavors and fish, eventually leading them to create a sweet, sour and savory Chinese-inspired version of\u00a0poisson cru. Tuna, julienned carrots and turnips, cucumber, onions, garlic and ginger, mixed with a beautiful dressing of lemon or lime juice, sugar, salt, pepper, sunflower oil and rice vinegar \u2013 a simple yet delicious manifestation of Chinese-Tahitian fusion that pays heed and compliment to the national dish. While not all poisson cru \u00e0 la chinoise recipes require the addition of sugar, French Polynesia\u2019s collective sweet tooth deems it unthinkable to exclude it. \u201cOur cooks make the dishes slightly sweeter than they would be normally to appeal to local tastes,\u201d says Karl Chung-Tan, second-generation owner of the Restaurant Golden Lake on the island of Mo\u2019orea. This extends to other dishes. For example, the classic Cantonese roast suckling pig is given a unique twist here: instead of being served with a yellow mustard dipping sauce as it is in Hong Kong or Guangzhou, it\u2019s paired with a side of lush and velvety coconut milk. Dishes like these make it clear French Polynesia\u2019s chefs aren\u2019t attempting to simply mirror their counterparts in China. By embracing local ingredients and tastes, as well as traditional Chinese techniques and flavors, they are able to create an even more uniquely delicious and innovative synthesis. Globalization has made accessing once hard-to-find ingredients relatively easy, and while authenticity has its charm, the evolution of Chinese-Tahitian fusion in French Polynesia makes for a rare and exciting culinary story. Ready to experience it first-hand? Below is a selection of restaurants throughout French Polynesia serving excellent Chinese-Tahitian food, along with recommended dishes to try. Tahiti Restaurant Le Dahlia (Arue) It was only appropriate that Restaurant Le Dahlia was my first introduction to Chinese-Tahitian cuisine. Opened in 1972, it\u2019s the oldest continuously operating Chinese restaurant in Tahiti. Their suckling pig with coconut milk is truly outstanding. Their steamed black bean parrotfish is said to be a must-try, but diners need to call a few days in advance to order it. Chez Mei (Papeete) I\u2019m not sure how many times one must eat\u00a0poisson cru\u00a0to be considered a connoisseur - but of the seven or eight times I enjoyed the dish throughout my recent trip, Chez Mei\u2019s\u00a0version\u00a0stood head and shoulders above the rest. Papeete Sunday Market The Papeete Sunday Market is the beating heart of French Polynesia\u2019s capital city. All kinds of goodies are available for purchase: wild-caught whole tunas, locally grown fruit and vegetables, freshly baked pain au chocolates and croissants,\u00a0poisson cru\u00a0by the pound, and even pearls and other souvenirs. Yet where the market really shines is its incredible array of Chinese dim sum (snack) offerings. While all these recommended dim sum dishes are of Chinese origin, some might be best known by a name in one of four languages: Tahitian, French, Hakka or Cantonese. As such, the corresponding local name for each item is listed. Embrace your inner polyglot and get snacking! \u2013 Chao pao (steamed stuffed buns)\u2013 Nems (spring rolls)\u2013 Bouchons/Siu Mai (steamed dumplings with pork, shrimp or chicken)\u2013 Samoussas (fried wontons)\u2013 Lopepan (white glutinous rice dumplings, filled with turnip, chicken and pepper)\u2013 Founpan (red glutinous rice dumplings, filled with brown sugar and crushed peanuts) The market opens at about 4 a.m. and tourists are advised to get there early. When I arrived at 4:15 a.m. it was already humming with activity; there was a line 20-30 people deep to grab a few slices of one vendor\u2019s famous Pua\u2019a Roti (Cantonese-style barbecue roast pork). Mo\u2019orea Restaurant Golden Lake (Temae) While not on the regular menu at Golden Lake, insiders can ask for a family-style portion of Ma\u2019a Tinito to be cooked to order. The mainstays of the dish are its thick, sweet and salty brown sauce and large chunks of tender pork, yet almost every other element is fungible; it\u2019s the perfect dish to cook at home when you\u2019re in a pinch. Versions of the dish vary as widely today as they probably did in the 1800s, as beans, macaroni, Chinese cabbage, taro, or rice noodles can be added as the chef desires. Traditionally, the dish was served with banana, yet today, locals more commonly enjoy it with rice or bread. Bora Bora Le Panda D\u2019Or (Vaitape) Le Panda D\u2019or is the only privately operated Chinese restaurant in Bora Bora. Located in Vaitape, Bora Bora\u2019s main city, travelers will likely pass by it on their way to or from a jet ski tour, shark and ray cruise, or when shuttling between different resorts, thus making it an easy lunch stop on the way to their next destination. Their shrimp-stuffed fish did not disappoint. Resorts At Bora Bora\u2019s world-famous resorts, the\u00a0executive\u00a0chefs and their teams are continually pushing the boundaries of Chinese-Tahitian fusion. The three following resorts I visited all expressed a strong incentive to develop new dishes to keep offerings exciting for their discerning guests. Bamboo (St. Regis Bora Bora) A favorite at this St. Regis Bora Bora restaurant is the\u00a0caramelized pork stir fry. The good-sized, ever-so-slightly fatty pieces of pork are crisped to perfection, and the addition of purple and green cabbage, onions and carrots made the dish visually appetizing. The portions are reasonable so you\u2019ll most likely have room for dessert. The Cocoriander is a must-try \u2013 provided you like coriander. The chocolate \u201ccoconut shell\u201d has freshly made coconut sorbet inside, which can be paired with as much or as little of the side of coriander cream as you please. Although coriander is certainly not an ingredient exclusive to Chinese cuisine, it\u2019s often used for flavoring and/or garnish in China, making the dish stand out as a beautiful example of innovative Chinese-Tahitian fusion. Banyan (Conrad Bora Bora) A modern Chinese restaurant, Banyan offers a local adaptation of a traditional Cantonese dish. Its lovingly hand-crafted Siu Mai (steamed pork and shrimp dumplings) are the five-star version of what you can find at the vibrant Sunday Market in Papeete. They can be enjoyed as presented, but feel free to ask the server for some vinegar or chili paste if you\u2019d like to try them as\u00a0dumplings are sometimes\u00a0eaten in China. All of the fish and shellfish at Banyan is locally sourced and that includes the signature wok-fried spiny lobster. Dishes are served in family-style portions, so expect a gracious amount of lobster meat, covered in a thick yet delicate, home-made XO sauce, a quintessential Hong Kong condiment. Vaimiti (Four Seasons Bora Bora) It\u2019s hard not to have high expectations of the food after seeing this restaurant\u2019s setting. Vaimiti, perched above idyllic cyan waters and pristine white sands, commands incredible views of Mount Otemanu and what might be the world\u2019s most beautiful beach. A menu mainstay of nearly two years here is the Hunan-style Mahi Mahi. \u201cHunan-style\u201d usually suggests a fiery heat, yet this dish has been made more appealing to guests from around the world with chilis that lend a sweet, rather than spicy, note.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/chinese-food-evolution-french-polynesia/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_airbus-beluga-gets-own-airline", "text": "The Airbus Beluga, one of the world\u2019s strangest airplanes, now has its own airline. The odd-looking, oversized cargo plane \u2014 a favorite among planespotters around the world \u2014 has been in service for close to two decades. It mainly transports aircraft parts between Airbus\u2019 manufacturing facilities spread throughout Europe. Now, a new version of the Beluga is replacing the original fleet, which has gone on to power a standalone freight airline called Airbus Beluga Transport. \u201cThere are very few options on the market for oversize items,\u201d says Beno\u00eet Lemonnier, head of Airbus Beluga Transport. \u201cMost often there\u2019s a need to partially dismantle a payload to make it fit in an aircraft \u2014 whereas in the Beluga, it will just fit.\u201d The original fleet The very first Beluga was originally known as the Airbus Super Transporter. But after its nickname \u2014 derived from the resemblance to the white Arctic whale \u2014 gained popularity, Airbus decided to rename the aircraft Beluga ST, retaining the original name in the acronym. It first flew in 1994 and entered service in 1995, followed over the years by four more examples, the last of which was rolled out in late 2000. \u201cThe Beluga was developed to transport large sections of Airbus aircraft from its factories in France, Germany, the UK, Spain and Turkey to the final assembly lines located in Toulouse and Hamburg,\u201d explains Lemonnier. \u201cIt is a very special design, because it\u2019s actually a transformation of an A300-600 that had its entire head removed and then equipped with special fuselage shells, a bigger door and dedicated flight equipment.\u201d Before the Beluga, Airbus was using a fleet of Super Guppies, modified versions of 1950s Boeing Stratocruiser passenger planes that had previously been in service with NASA to ferry spacecraft parts. Now, history is repeating itself as the original Beluga is being replaced by a more spacious and advanced model, the Beluga XL. Longer and bigger than the ST, the Beluga XL is capable of carrying both wings, rather than just one, of the Airbus A350, the company\u2019s latest long-haul aircraft that rivals the Boeing 787 and 777. \u201cThe XL is based on a much more modern platform, the A330,\u201d Lemonnier adds. \u201cSince 2018, six XLs have been built, and the latest one will be delivered very soon to the internal Airbus airline. The Beluga XL can fully substitute the Beluga ST on the internal Airbus network, so the STs can become available for alternative service.\u201d Old but not out The original Beluga STs might be approaching two decades of service, but according to Lemonnier, there\u2019s still a lot of life left in them: \u201cDepending on how often they fly, they may remain in service for 20 more years, easily.\u201d One of them will keep working for Airbus and ferry aircraft parts, while the remaining four will be exclusively in the fleet of the new cargo airline. It\u2019s not the first time that the Belugas are used outside Airbus, however. \u201cWe had some chartered flights between 2000 and 2010, when there was some capacity left and the Beluga were used to transport helicopters and satellites,\u201d he says. Then, in 2022, the company completed a dozen test missions in preparation for the airline launch. \u201cThe difference now is that we are fully standalone, so we can be flexible for our customers and accept date changes, for example, meaning we can stay in one area to wait for a payload \u2014 something that would probably be impossible for the Airbus internal airline to do,\u201d Lemonnier says. Because the Beluga ST\u2019s cargo hold is 50% higher and 10% wider than regular cargo aircraft \u2014 like the Boeing 747-8F \u2014\u00a0it is generally used to transport voluminous items such as satellites, helicopters, aircraft engines, flight simulators, sailing boats and army vehicles. Flying on the Beluga can be a little different than on regular aircraft, Lemonnier notes.  \u201cIt can have a sensitive behavior in the wind due to its big head, and that\u2019s why it requires specific training for pilots,\u201d he says. \u201cBut otherwise it flies very much like an A300-600 \u2014 the cockpit is totally unchanged.\u201d One limitation is the range of 3,000 kilometers (1,600 nautical miles), which means that trips from Europe to the United States require up to two refueling stops, generally in the Azores and Canada. Another is the maximum cargo weight of 40 metric tons; because the Beluga is designed for volume, rivals like the Antonov AN-124 can carry three times as much weight, and the former largest airplane in the world \u2014 the AN-225, destroyed in 2022 \u2014 had capacity for a whopping 250 tons. A niche market The intended operation for the Airbus Beluga Transport is quite different to standard commercial freighter operations, according to Gary Crichlow, an aviation analyst at consultancy firm AviationValues. \u201cTransporting helicopters, satellites and other large assets brings certain operational complexities that transporting packages for Amazon would not normally have to deal with,\u201d he says. \u201cFor example, the maximum altitude at which a helicopter\u2019s structure is certificated sets the maximum altitude at which the transport flight can operate.\u201d Crichlow also notes that while the Beluga ST\u2019s capacity of 40 metric tons pales in comparison to Antonov aircraft, there are five Beluga STs, and Airbus advertises them as featuring one of the most voluminous cargo holds of any civil or military aircraft flying today. \u201cClearly Airbus is not aiming to be Amazon Prime,\u201d he says, \u201cbut having amortized each Beluga\u2019s \u20ac183 million ($199 million) cost over the past 20 years, this would appear to be a relatively low-risk opportunity to earn revenue from a niche of the freighter market.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/airbus-beluga-gets-own-airline/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_worlds-best-barbecue-grill", "text": "Americans are perhaps the standard bearers of the \u201cbarbecue.\u201d Backyards and parks in the United States are full of people gathering around sauce-slathered chicken and other meats. But famed as America\u2019s grill skills may be, many would claim it can\u2019t hold a glowing charcoal ember to the meat-charring culture of, say, Argentina or South Africa. History isn\u2019t clear on where the term \u201cbarbecue\u201d comes from \u2013 one explanation is that it comes from \u201cbarbacoa,\u201d a term used by Spanish explorers to describe the Caribbean\u2019s indigenous Taino people\u2019s cooking technique. In any case, barbecue as we know it today covers multiple cooking methods: On grills, above fire pits, under the ground and in clay ovens. There are regional variations and customs in destinations from South America to Africa to Asia. Read on for further proof that the lip-smacking barbecue experience is a universal tradition, not just an American one. Braai (South Africa) The South African braai (\u201cbarbecue\u201d in Afrikaans) is the nation\u2019s top culinary custom. Here, the frequent gathering of friends and family over grilled, juicy cuts of steak, sausage and chicken sosaties (skewers) cuts through all racial and socioeconomic lines. And no place does \u201cSunday Funday\u201d quite like the townships, where shisa nyama (\u201cburn meat\u201d in Zulu) venues elevate the braai experience with on-site butchers, cooks, drinks and party-starting DJs. Chicago native and model Unique Love spent three years living in Cape Town and fondly recalls her first shisa nyama. \u201cHaving a braai in Cape Town\u2019s Mzoli\u2019s Meat felt like home,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter eating, I never wanted to [leave] because the community\u2019s ambiance felt comforting.\u201d Asado (Argentina) Though its place as the world\u2019s top consumer of beef fluctuates each year, many would claim Argentina will forever be the grande dame of barbecued meats. Like South Africa\u2019s braai culture, Argentina\u2019s affinity for the grill is more entrenched than in the States. Attending a sociable, gut-busting asado (\u201cbarbecue\u201d) on an almost weekly basis is the norm. Though a variety of meats and cuts can be experienced at any gathering, Argentinian Guillermo Pernot, chef-partner of Cuba Libre Restaurant & Rum Bar, insists: \u201cFor the absolute best asado, one should cook a sweet pork and beef sausage, sweetbreads, thigh intestines and blood sausages.\u201d Other asado tips from the two-time winner of the James Beard Award include using coarse salt to coat meats and to have the \u201cindispensable\u201d chimichurri \u2013 a sauce and marinade that usually consists of parsley, garlic, oregano, vinegar and chili flakes \u2013 at the ready. Yaiktori (Japan) Yakitori, a favorite in Japan, consists of diced chicken assembled onto bamboo skewers and cooked over a smoldering layer of charcoal. Yakitori variations are labeled by chicken parts (strips of chicken skin make up \u201ctowikawa\u201d and \u201cnegima\u201d consists of thigh meat with leeks). Its definition has expanded to include any grilled, skewered food, including vegetables, seafood, pork and beef. While there are several ways to enjoy authentic yakitori in Japan, travel blogger Tanya Spaulding shares her tips for maximum enjoyment. \u201cThe best way to savor yakitori is either from a street vendor, or sitting on the floor in your yukata (a sort of summer kimono), cooking your skewers over the shichirin (a small charcoal grill) in the middle of your table,\u201d she claims. Churrasco (Brazil) Barbecue enthusiasts with sizable appetites will love Brazil\u2019s churrasco (Portuguese and Spanish for \u201cbarbecue\u201d). Most visitors to Brazil will get their barbecue fix at a churrascaria, where restaurant servers provide an endless supply of grilled meat cuts directly to patrons\u2019 tables.\u00a0 While Brazilian churrasco might be the most famous, it\u2019s found in several other countries, including Bolivia, Ecuador, Guatemala and Portugal. Dan Clarke, director of RealWorld Holidays, who frequents South America, believes Brazilian barbecues offer more options for vegetarians than neighboring, meat-loving Argentina. \u201cAt an Argentinian asado, you\u2019re really stuck with the salad and fries,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s much better in Brazil because most churrascarias feature salad bars with dozens of kinds of fresh salads, pasta salads, pickles, breads, olives and all the other sides you could wish for.\u201d Lechon (Philippines) Lechon (Spanish for \u201csuckling pig\u201d) features a whole, impaled pig spit-roasted over a charcoal bed or in an oven. Many Filipinos declare the tasty, porky treat to be their national dish although the same claim is made by Puerto Ricans. The lechon cooked on the Filipino island of Cebu is often considered the best in the country, if not the world. Fun fact: Every June 24 in Balayan, Philippines, the locals pay a special, religious-themed homage to roasted pig at the Parada ng Lechon (Parade of Spit-Roast Pig). It involves lechons getting blessed at a church mass followed by a lively parade of floats, music, water guns (for the baptism) and lechons \u201cdressed\u201d in outlandish garments and accessories. Tandoor (India) It\u2019s true: that iconic Indian tandoori chicken you\u2019ve known (and perhaps loved) for ages is considered a barbecue dish. Tandoori food derives its name from the tandoor, the cauldron-like clay oven in which dishes such as naan bread, chicken, seafood and other meats are cooked under high-heat charcoal. \u201cThe art of the tandoor originated centuries ago as a nomadic style of cooking in Central Asia [where] food was cooked on charcoal pits and meat was spit-roasted,\u201d says Manjit Gill, corporate chef for ITC Hotels and an Indian celebrity cook behind several acclaimed restaurants including Bukhara in New Delhi. \u201cThe Tandoori cuisine as we know it today was introduced in the late 1940s in post-partition India, when people discovered that it was a better medium to cook meat in a tandoor rather than on the spit.\u201d Mongolian BBQ (Taiwan) \u201cSurprisingly, despite the name, Taiwan is the origin of Mongolian barbecue,\u201d reveals travel enthusiast and native Taiwanese Erin Yang. \u201c[It] consists of the combination of sliced meat, noodles and vegetables quickly cooked over a flat circular metal surface.\u201d Mongolian barbecue is a relatively new food trend, emerging in Taiwan in the 1950s and influenced by Japanese teppanyaki and Chinese stir-fry. It\u2019s also popular in certain regions of China. Beijing-based food and travel blogger Monica Weintraub says beef and lamb feature heavily in the north of the country. \u201cWhether you\u2019re sharing a leg of lamb between four or five friends or ordering single lamb skewers (yang rou chuan), be expected to intake meat heavily doused in chili powder, cumin seeds and salt,\u201d she says. Lovo (Fiji) Fiji\u2019s barbecue tradition has more of an underground approach compared to other nations. Erin Yang explains: \u201cUnlike many other barbecue styles, Fijian barbecue is cooked in a \u2018lovo,\u2019 an earth oven.\u201d Lovo involves piping-hot stones placed into a large opening in the ground to allow slowly smoked cooking. \u201cIngredients such as pork, chicken, vegetables, taro root and seafood are wrapped in taro or banana leaves and placed onto the stones,\u201d Yang says. \u201cAfter 2-3 hours, the savory lovo will be ready to serve.\u201d Unearthing the pit-smoked food is met with jubilation from feasters, perhaps due to the hours-long wait for the cooking to be completed. Umu (Samoa) Umu, Samoa\u2019s version of the barbecue, is similar to the underground cooking customs of Fijian lovo. Avichai Ben Tzur, a travel writer/entrepreneur who\u2019s spent significant time in the South Pacific, describes barbecue prep work as a family task. \u201cYoung men of the extended Samoan family gather together to prepare the \u2018umu,\u2019 hours before the traditional Sunday feast commences\u2026 catching fresh fish or slaughtering a pig, collecting taro leaves and breadfruit from the family\u2019s agricultural plot and cracking open coconuts for the palusami.\u201d The palusami, a Samoan staple made of coconut cream (often seasoned with onions, lemon juice and simple spices) wrapped in taro leaves, is \u201ca delicious calorie bomb that cannot be resisted by Samoans,\u201d says Tzur. Gogigui (Korean Peninsula) Gogigui (Korean for \u201cmeat roast\u201d) is a favorite of both Koreans and international eaters. Dining at a Korean BBQ usually consists of sliced beef, pork and chicken with an assortment of banchan (side dishes) and rice cooked in the center of a table, which is either cooked by the chefs or the diners themselves. Should you choose to cook your own gogigui, \u201cMasterchef Korea\u201d finalist Diane Sooyeon Kang shares some tips. \u201cFor thin slices of meat like chadolbaegi (thinly sliced beef brisket), you should lie it flat and cook it quickly for a few seconds on each side,\u201d she says. \u201cFor meats like yangnyeom galbi (marinated short ribs), high heat and fire will be best as it will caramelize the outside while keeping the meat juicy inside.\u201d Jessica Mehta, who\u2019s lived in Korea for a year, suggests: \u201cYou\u2019re not really having Korean BBQ if you don\u2019t pair it with soju, a clear liquor somewhat similar to sake.\u201d Pachamanca (Peru) Though Peruvian cuisine is known the world over for ceviche and Pisco sour cocktails, one of Peru\u2019s most traditional Incan cooking customs, pachamanca, is still under the radar to many. Pachamanca (meaning \u201cearth pot\u201d in the Quechua language) involves digging to create a ground oven and lining the cavity with fire-heated stones to cook the food. A variety of potatoes, corn, legumes and marinated meats are enclosed in banana leaves and placed into the earth oven for hours. Authentic pachamanca are served sitting on the ground, and mostly take place on special occasions (especially religious ceremonies) and during harvest time every February and March.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/worlds-best-barbecue-grill/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_hidden-spaces-on-planes", "text": "There are some secret areas on widebody aircraft, where the pilots and cabin crew go to rest during long flights. Passengers can\u2019t access them under any circumstance and they\u2019re well hidden from view. They\u2019re called Crew Rest Compartments and their location on the plane varies. On newer aircraft, such as the Boeing 787 or the Airbus A350, they are located above the main cabin, in the upper fuselage. But on older aircraft, they can also be in the cargo hold or simply in the main cabin. They come in pairs: one for the pilots, which usually sits above the cockpit and often includes two bunks and a recliner seat, and another for the cabin crew, usually containing six bunks or more and placed above the aft galley, the section at the back of the plane where food and drinks are prepared and stored. Like a capsule hotel Airlines have a say in the configuration of the crew rest areas when they purchase a plane, but the main parameters are set by regulators such as the Federal Aviation Administration. It mandates, for example, that the crew rest areas should be \u201cin a location where intrusive noise, odors and vibration have minimum effect on sleep,\u201d and that they must be temperature-controlled and allow the crew to adjust lighting. The bunks (\u201cor other surface that allows for a flat sleeping position\u201d) have to be 78 by 30 inches (198 by 76 centimeters) in size \u2013 tall people beware \u2013 and have at least 35 cubic feet, or one cubic meter, of space around them. There also has to be a communal area for changing, entering and exiting that provides at least 65 cubic feet of space. The end result is somewhat similar to a Japanese capsule hotel: a windowless, cramped, but cozy sleeping space, with power outlets and a light \u2013 as well as all of the required safety equipment such as oxygen masks, seat belt lights and an intercom, among others. \u201cThey can be quite comfortable,\u201d says Susannah Carr, a flight attendant with United Airlines who works on Boeing aircraft including the 787, 777 and 767. \u201cThey have a padded mattress, an air vent to keep the air circulating and temperature controls so you can keep it cooler or warmer, and we\u2019re provided with linens, usually similar to the ones used in business class on our international flights. I like them \u2013 but I\u2019m also only about 5 foot 8 inches, so if you put a 6 foot 4 inch person in there, they might be a little tight,\u201d she says. But are they better than a business or even first class seat? \u201cIn some ways yes, in some ways no,\u201d says Carr. \u201cThe bunks can be wider than first class and for me personally, depending on the aircraft, I get more legroom. But it\u2019s a bunk, so you don\u2019t necessarily have the full head space of being in the cabin and obviously you don\u2019t have the privacy either. And if you\u2019re claustrophobic, you can definitely feel that there \u2013 it\u2019s an airplane, so you only have so much space to put things. They certainly make use of every inch up there.\u201d Tucked away The crew rest areas are designed to not attract too much attention from passengers, regardless of where they are located: \u201cA passenger walking by would probably think it\u2019s a closet,\u201d says Carr. \u201cI won\u2019t go too far into how we access it \u2013 it\u2019s secure, I will say that. Occasionally we have people that think it\u2019s a bathroom door and they try to open it, but we just show them the way to the actual restroom instead.\u201d Behind the door there is usually a small landing and a ladder leading upstairs, at least on the latest aircraft. \u201cThe bunks are either open on the side or one end, so you can crawl in \u2013 I sometimes jokingly refer to them as \u2018the catacombs,\u2019\u201d says Carr. On slightly older aircraft, such as the Airbus A330, the crew rest compartment can also be in the cargo hold, so a staircase would lead down instead. But on even older planes such as the Boeing 767, the rest areas are located in the main cabin, and are just recliner seats with curtains around them. \u201cThey are very heavy curtains, they block out light and a good amount of sound, but not if you\u2019ve got an energetic crowd on the plane or an upset child. We\u2019ve had passengers open the curtains, looking for something or thinking they\u2019d be going into the galley, so it\u2019s not necessarily the best rest.\u201d Unsurprisingly, most flight attendants prefer the overhead bunks to the curtained seats, but the upgrade is beneficial to airlines too, who don\u2019t have to give up precious cabin space that can be used for passenger seats instead. Seniority order Cabin crew members on long haul flights usually spend at least 10% of the planned flight time in the rest areas. \u201cOn average, I would say that means about 1.5 hours per long-haul flight,\u201d says Karoliina \u00c5man, a flight attendant with Finnair who works on Airbus A330 and A350 aircraft. This, however, can vary depending on the airline and flight time \u2013 rest time can extend up to a few hours. \u201cSince we don\u2019t have any private area in the aircraft for our lunch or coffee breaks, this rest period is extremely important and helpful for us,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is the moment during the flight when we don\u2019t answer passengers\u2019 calls or do any other task but rest, and let our feet and mind have their break too. The purpose of this rest is to maintain an alert and ready mindset during the whole flight so that if anything unexpected happens, we are ready to take action.\u201d Not everyone sleeps once in the bunk, however. \u201cUsually on an outbound flight from Helsinki I use my rest to listen to some audiobook or read a book since I am coming from home and am well rested. But on an inbound flight from the destination to Helsinki, there might be sleepless nights behind you \u2013 for example I have trouble sleeping in Asia \u2013 and then during the rest, you usually fall asleep. Waking up from that sleep can be a really harsh experience sometimes if your brain has switched to night sleep mode,\u201d says \u00c5man. \u201cJet lag can be a tricky beast,\u201d says Carr, \u201cSometimes I can unwind and I can sleep, other times my body\u2019s just not ready for a nap. But because we\u2019re on a break, we\u2019re allowed to use our phones, so we could watch a movie on it, or read a book.\u201d The rest areas are closed during taxi, takeoff and landing, and they are used based on shifts overseen by the cabin manager \u2013 or chief purser, in aviation lingo \u2013 the cabin crew member who\u2019s in charge of all the others and supervises operations on board. This person usually gets to use a special bunk that is near the entrance of the rest areas and has access to an intercom, to communicate with the pilots and the rest of the crew. \u201cEverything in our industry is seniority based, from the schedule you fly to the routes you can hold, to your days off,\u201d explains Carr. \u201cThe longer you\u2019ve been there, the better the perks and one of those perks is picking your crew break time \u2013 we go on seniority order, so the person who\u2019s the most senior on the flight gets to choose whether they prefer the first break or the second break, and then you go through the list until everyone has breaks.\u201d Piloting perks The rest area for the pilots, which is separate from the one dedicated to the cabin crew, is close to the cockpit. Depending on the duration of the flight, there can be up to four pilots on board, but two will always be in the cockpit; therefore, the pilots\u2019 rest area only has two bunks (or even just one on older aircraft) but it includes a seat sometimes equipped with in-flight entertainment, which the cabin crew do not get. Other than that, the compartments are pretty similar. \u201cI usually sleep pretty well in there,\u201d says Aleksi Kuosmanen, deputy fleet chief pilot at Finnair. Kuosmanen flies on A330 and A350 aircraft, and says he prefers the latter\u2019s rest area, which is located above the forward galley rather than in the main cabin. \u201cIt has really good curtains, you can adjust the temperature really well, there\u2019s great ventilation, and it\u2019s more soundproof. You don\u2019t hear anything of what\u2019s happening in the galleys, it\u2019s really quiet and comfortable.\u201d The next time you\u2019re on a long-haul flight, you might want to keep your eyes peeled for an inconspicuous door at the front or the back of the plane \u2013 if you see a pilot or flight attendant disappear into it, you might have spotted a rest area. But keep in mind that crew members won\u2019t necessarily be happy to show you around, as passenger access to the rest areas is prohibited: \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like Disney \u2013 we keep the magic behind closed doors,\u201d says Carr. \u201cYou don\u2019t necessarily want to know that your flight attendants are getting a little bit of shuteye, but at the same time you\u2019ll be happy when we pop up after our little cat nap all fresh as a daisy.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/hidden-spaces-on-planes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "travel"}}

Taquer\u00eda El Califa de Le\u00f3n, located in the San Rafael neighborhood of Mexico City, was among the establishments to garner either one or two stars in the first ever Michelin Guide Mexico, published earlier this week, making it the first Mexican taco stand to receive the honor. Chef Arturo Rivera Mart\u00ednez, who has been serving customers at Taquer\u00eda El Califa de Le\u00f3n for at least two decades, was presented with the famous white chef\u2019s jacket while dishing out his popular tacos on Wednesday. \u201cThe secret is the simplicity of our taco,\u201d Rivera Mart\u00ednez told the Associated Press. \u201cIt has only a tortilla, red or green sauce, and that\u2019s it. That, and the quality of the meat.\u201d Taquer\u00eda El Califa de Le\u00f3n, which is only about 10 feet wide, has been around for more than 50 years and is known for its Gaonera taco, apparently named in honor of Mexican bullfighter Rodolfo Gaona. \u201cThis taqueria may be bare bones with just enough room for a handful of diners to stand at the counter but its creation, the Gaonera taco, is exceptional,\u201d reads a statement on the Michelin Guide website. \u201cThinly sliced beef filet is expertly cooked to order, seasoned with only salt and a squeeze of lime. \u201cAt the same time, a second cook prepares the excellent corn tortillas alongside. The resulting combination is elemental and pure.\u201d When asked which drink he\u2019d recommend that diners match with the \u201cexceptional\u201d tacos, Rivera Mart\u00ednez told reporters, \u201cI like a Coke.\u201d Aside from the aforementioned Gaonera taco, customers can opt for three other meat-filled variations, including a bistec (beef steak) filling, served up on a plastic plate for around $5. \u201cWith meat and tortillas of this caliber, the duo of house-made salsas is hardly even necessary,\u201d says the Michelin Guide. Fine dining restaurant Quintonil, run by chef Jorge Vallejo and Alejandra Flores, awarded two stars, and chef Elena Reygadas\u2019s Rosetta, awarded one star, were among the other establishments included on Michelin\u2019s first-ever rankings for Mexico. Focusing on Mexico City, Oaxaca, Baja California, Los Cabos and Nuevo Le\u00f3n, the Michelin Guide inspectors traveled up and down the country to seek out the best culinary experiences on offer. \u201cWhat a joy it is to honor the uniqueness of the Mexican gastronomic landscape in Mexico City,\u201d Gwendal Poullennec, International Director of the Michelin Guides, said in a statement. \u201cThe first and very promising selection is an an illustration of how the country is showcasing its regions, with their cultures and traditions that are as distinctive as they are distinguishable.\u201d Back in 2016, chef Chan Hon Meng\u2019s Singapore stall became the first street-food establishment to be recognized by the distinguished guide.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/taqueria-el-califa-de-leon-mexico-city/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_canada-house-d-day-intl", "text": "Their target was an elegant, two-story villa sitting solitary on a misty beach. No houses stood nearby, just minefields, military pillboxes and enemy machine gun posts. It was D-Day, and on that overcast morning on June 6, 1944, 10 boats filled with Canadian troops crossed the English Channel\u2019s choppy waters to head for the 1,500 yard stretch of Normandy coastline where the house was located. These soldiers\u2019 small part in the world\u2019s largest seaborne invasion was to capture the coastal town of Bernieres-sur-Mer. Seizing the villa would be a key objective. Aerial photographs had led them to falsely believe that it was a railway station. Regardless of what it was, allied war planners wanted to use it as a lookout toward the sea once the beach was captured. To get there, the troops would have to cross the open beach. It would be an assault landing, with almost nowhere to hide. The troops hit the shore at 7:15 a.m. and were met by unrelenting machine gun and mortar fire. Within 20 minutes, the soldiers that had managed to survive the initial onslaught reached the villa and expelled the German troops inside. It was, in all likelihood, the first house to be liberated after the beach landings during Operation Overlord. The cost was extreme. About 100 Canadians died on that beach in the first few minutes of the battle. The villa, though riddled with bullet holes and other battle scars, was intact. Eighty years later, the half-timbered home remains. It is called \u201cLa Maison de Canadiens\u201d in French, or Canada House in English, and it is now a memorial dedicated to the Canadians who gave their lives to liberate France thanks to the work of one French couple. Opening the door to strangers After Nicole and Herve Hoffer married in 1975 and then had children, they began spending more time at the family\u2019s vacation home Bernieres-sur-Mer. Nicole noticed that people walking by on the boardwalk between the house and the beach often stopped to take photographs of the building. She asked her husband why, but he didn\u2019t know. The villa was constructed in 1928 by a Parisian man who wanted his two children to have vacation homes of their own. So he built two adjoining houses, with one side for his daughter and another for his son. Herve Hoffer\u2019s grandparents purchased the daughter\u2019s side in 1936. The Hoffers knew that the house had been occupied by the Germans in 1942 and then returned to their family five years later, luckily relatively intact. Countless other homes had been destroyed by the allied bombardment during the Battle of Normandy. But why people kept photographing their house was a mystery. So the Hoffers began inquiring, and many of the people taking pictures turned out to be Canadian veterans on a pilgrimage back to where they landed on D-Day. The couple would invite them inside for a beer, a glass of Calvados \u2013 an apple brandy native to Normandy \u2013 or a meal, over which former soldiers shared their stories. \u201cEven in my own family, I\u2019ve been criticized \u2026 how could I open the door to strangers?\u201d Nicole Hoffer said. \u201cI\u2019d say, well, if the foreigners hadn\u2019t come, you might not be here today. They brought us freedom, many at the risk of their lives.\u201d The Hoffers typically found the first moments of an encounter particularly moving. As veterans sat down for the first time, they\u2019d look out the window as if they were in a film that had taken a decades-long pause, Nicole Hoffer said. Then they would share stories that even their families and friends had never heard. With each meeting, the story of the Hoffer family vacation home emerged, piece by piece. The family learned that when Canadian troops landed at H-Hour, the beginning of the amphibious assault, the Germans that were inside the home fired at them from a machine gun mounted on a bench and aimed outside the front window. Many of the soldiers who were not gunned down hid behind a beach wall near the home, from which they were able to regroup and expel the German troops from the house. Many soldiers who return, Nicole Hoffer said, are surprised to find the wall gone, buried by sand over the years. The house, however, still looks mostly the same. A summer home filled with war memories The Hoffers found that as veterans kept coming back over the years, more and more began to bring souvenirs for them, so many that their summer home is now effectively doubles as a museum. Their guestbook has collected hundreds \u2013 if not thousands \u2013 of signatures from veterans and their families returning to Juno Beach. One signer, Ernie Kells, even apologized for tossing grenades into their basement to flush out German troops. Donated medals, flags, paintings and other keepsakes adorn the walls, including a cross featuring a Jesus icon whose arm had apparently been blown off while in a soldier\u2019s pocket. The man had found the cross intact in a nearby house, and shrapnel that hit it may have saved his life. Years later, on his death bed, the man had asked his family to return the cross to the Hoffer\u2019s home. \u201cIn the house, you find a lot of memories,\u201d she said. The Hoffers eventually began hosting their own ceremony to honor Canada\u2019s fallen soldiers. About a week before June 6, they light a paraffin lantern and leave it burning on the balcony. Then on the evening of the anniversary, bagpipers play as the lamp is tossed into the sea, while guests place flowers and crosses where the water meets the sand. Herve Hoffer was responsible for throwing the lamp himself until his sudden death in 2017, To honor his memory, Nicole Hoffer has opened the house to even more veterans than when he was alive. \u201cNow there\u2019s trips, entire buses who come and ask if we can open the house,\u201d she said. For the 80th anniversary of D-Day this year, Hoffer is expecting a larger crowd. Not only will there be the usual contingent of visitors to her home, but the west side of the house will open to the public for the first time since being purchased by the local government. It is hosting an exhibit featuring the testimony of French men and women who lived through D-Day as children.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/canada-house-d-day-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "travel"}}

The authorities in the town of Platja d\u2019Aro, on Spain\u2019s Costa Brava and around 60 miles northeast of Barcelona, have introduced fines for anyone daring to go out in public in costumes depicting genitalia or carrying sex dolls. Individuals could be left with a $811 fine (\u20ac750) for \u201cwalking or standing on a street or public space without clothing, or only in underwear, or for wearing clothing or accessories that represent human genitals, or with dolls of a sexual nature,\u201d a city hall spokesman told CNN Thursday. Higher tolls of up to $1,620 (\u20ac1,500) could also be levied for anti-social behavior which causes more of a disturbance, though the exact nature of these offenses remains unclear. The new measures also prohibit going shirtless or venturing out in nothing more than a bikini in urban areas away from the beach, the spokesman added. They will come into effect around the end of June. Platja d\u2019Aro has a population of 12,500, but on summer weekends it can draw in around 150,000 visitors a day. The town council this week approved the new fines and said it would hire more police to enforce them. Police will issue a penalty, but alleged offenders could appeal and would not have to pay on the spot, the city hall spokesman said. At a press conference earlier this week, the city\u2019s police chief cited a recent celebration in which the groom was taped to a lamp post while his friends played loud music and sang late into the night, annoying local residents, the spokesman said. \u201cThese types of activities are not exclusive to Platja d\u2019Aro. Each town should decide how to change this situation,\u201d the spokesman added. The town\u2019s 48-member police force will get 12 additional officers during the six-month peak tourist season, which includes spring and early summer when there are many weddings - as well as the bachelor and bachelorette parties which precede them. Badly behaved visitors come from across Spain and beyond, according to the spokesman, who added that the town\u2019s permanent residents include citizens from 80 nationalities. City Hall plans to enlist the help of owners of local hotels, tourist lodgings, bars and restaurants in the campaign to improve coexistence with tourists in the town. Spain is facing a growing number of protests in connection with overtourism. Demonstrators have threatened to bring Mallorca airport to a standstill this summer in an attempt to curb mass tourism, while measures to crack down on public drinking and party boats have been introduced in the Balearic Islands.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/travel/spain-tourist-fines-costa-brava-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_worlds-50-best-restaurants-for-2024", "text": "Any doubts that Spain remains the fine dining center of the world may just have evaporated with the revealing of the World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants for 2024 list. Five eateries from the European nation made the list \u2013 three of them in the top five. The awards\u00a0\u2013 considered the Oscars of global fine dining \u2013 were handed out at a ceremony at the Wynn in Las Vegas on Wednesday evening, with Barcelona\u2019s Disfrutar walking away with the top prize. Ranked number two last year, it\u2019s owned and run by chefs Oriol Castro, Eduard Xatruch and Mateu Casanas. The fact that this trio met while working at the legendary El Bulli should provide a few clues as to what diners can expect \u2013 imaginative and playful dishes executed with technical mastery, such as the caviar-filled Panchino doughnut, the frozen gazpacho sandwich and squab with kombu spaghetti, almond and grape. Coming in at number two was Asador Etxebarri of Atxondo, not far from the Spanish port city of Bilbao. Under the leadership of chef Victor Arguinzoniz, it\u2019s famed for offering unbeatable barbecue that lets the quality of the ingredients shine, such as a red Palam\u00f3s prawn that\u2019s simply grilled and served on its own. But you can never count Paris out.\u00a0The French capital\u2019s Table by Bruno Verjus\u00a0squeezed into third place, while yet another restaurant from Spain \u2013 Madrid\u2019s Diverxo \u2013 took the fourth spot. Coming in at fifth was Lima\u2019s Maido, one of three restaurants from the city to make the list, giving the Peruvian capital\u2019s reputation as South America\u2019s premier dining destination yet another boost. Mexico was the big winner in North America, earning three restaurants on the list, led by Mexico City eatery Quintonil, which came in seventh. The rest of the list Securing five restaurants on the list was enough to make Spain the biggest winner of the night in Vegas. In terms of cities, Paris and Bangkok tied for first, each with four restaurants on the list. Gaggan Anand, at number nine, was the Thai capital\u2019s top entry. As for the event\u2019s host country, the US had two restaurants on this year\u2019s 50 Best list. New York City\u2019s Atomix came in 6th this year, rising two spots since last year. SingleThread, in the town of Healdsburg in California\u2019s Sonoma Valley, landed in 46th place. Three restaurants from Tokyo were awarded, with eatery S\u00e9zanne\u00a0(voted Asia\u2019s best restaurant in 2024) ranking the highest in the Japanese capital, at 15. Hong Kong saw two of its restaurants hit the list, with both making impressive moves. Wing was the city\u2019s highest new entry on the entire list, at 20, while The Chairman was the highest climber, moving from last year\u2019s 50th spot into number 26. The list is compiled based on the votes of the\u00a0The World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants Academy, which is made up of\u00a0 1,080 international restaurant industry experts including food writers and chefs, in 27 regions around the world. Restaurants can only win the top prize once, after which they\u2019re entered into a separate \u201cBest of the Best\u201d program. Members of that elite group include Geranium and Noma in Copenhagen, as well as New York\u2019s Eleven Madison Park, The Fat Duck near London, Osteria Francescana in Modena, Italy, and Mirazur in Menton, France.

{"id": "travel_flight-attendants-surviving-long-haul-flights", "text": "Any air travel can be stressful, but facing down a long-haul flight can be especially intimidating. Should you prioritize sleeping or eating, or both? Should you attempt to exercise in the aisle? Is it ever acceptable to take off your shoes? Kris Major is a British flight attendant with 25 years\u2019 experience. He\u2019s worked short-haul hops and spent 14-hour stretches in the sky. He\u2019s endured journeys with an unenviable number of layovers, and he\u2019s become an expert in refueling via power naps at 30,000 feet. As many of us prepare for long-haul trips over the summer, Major tells CNN Travel his tips and tricks on surviving multiple hours in the sky. Should you eat before or during an overnight flight? If you\u2019re catching a night flight and you want to maximize sleep on board, Major suggests eating before boarding. This is particularly important if the flight is on the shorter end of the long-haul scale: if you\u2019re traveling from New York to London, for example, at best you\u2019re looking at around five or six hours sleep, so you want to make the most of that rest time. Major, who also represents European flight attendants and pilots as chair of the European Transport Workers\u2019 Federation\u2019s Joint Aircrew Committee, says it\u2019s telling that most business travelers shut their eyes as soon as they get on board. \u201cThe seasoned travelers, after takeoff, you go down the cabin and you can see that they\u2019re gone \u2013 they\u2019ve covered themselves up and they\u2019re asleep,\u201d he says. Still, Major admits that eating before flying isn\u2019t always doable, because of long security lines and busy airport terminals. Even if you have the best intentions, you can end up settling for a sad-looking sandwich as you run to the gate. If you\u2019re flying business or first class, you also might be tempted to make the most of food and drink offered on board \u2013 it\u2019s hard to turn down complimentary champagne, after all. But realistically, the cabin food and drink service can take a good two hours, so you\u2019re losing valuable rest time \u2013 and your Business Class ticket should give you access to an airport lounge, so max out those facilities instead, and board the plane well-fueled and ready to rest. So when should you eat on the plane? If you\u2019re flying long-haul, you\u2019ll likely be offered more than one meal during the course of the flight. Meal times start to feel a bit arbitrary when you\u2019re crossing multiple time zones, but should you eat whenever food is offered to you? Or should you turn meals down if you\u2019re not hungry or trying to sleep? Major says passengers should do whatever\u2019s right for their travel schedule. If you\u2019re exhausted, you\u2019re better off sleeping than forcing yourself to eat dinner at the equivalent of 3 a.m. \u201cMost airlines don\u2019t particularly plan their [food] service around the passenger and acclimatization and time zones crossing,\u201d explains Major. Should you bring a travel pillow or rely on the airline offerings? Airlines usually provide pillows for long-haul travelers, no matter the cabin, but Major says bringing your own eye mask, travel pillow and/or a blanket could be a good idea depending on your preferences. Eye masks are great if you\u2019re trying to sleep when the cabin lights are on, while you might prefer your own travel pillow to the airline version. Plus, while it\u2019s rare, there\u2019s always the chance that pillows are unavailable \u2013 something that could be a big problem on a 14-hour flight. \u201cIt happens,\u201d says Major. \u201cSo I would say, cater yourself for your own comfort and your own needs as much as you possibly can.\u201d What if you can\u2019t sleep? Many of us find it difficult to sleep on airplanes, whether due to unfamiliar noises or, for the cheaper seats, limited leg room and upright positions. Struggling to sleep on a long flight, knowing you\u2019re going to pay for the lost hours when you land, can be an unpleasant cycle of worry. Should you persevere and keep trying, or give up and watch a movie? Major says there\u2019s no point trying to force sleep, particularly if your body clock thinks it\u2019s the middle of the day and you\u2019re simply not tired. But he cautions that it\u2019s important to bear in mind what you\u2019re doing at the other end. If you\u2019re going to be driving, for example, or going straight to a meeting, you should try and rest as much as you can. What are the flight attendant rest areas like? Crew rest areas exist on all airplanes, but what these rest areas look like depends on the airline, aircraft and the length of the flight. \u201cIf we\u2019re going somewhere over, say, 13 hours, we need to have good rest areas,\u201d says Major, who explains flight attendants should typically be entitled to breaks that allow for 90 minutes of sleep. That way, they\u2019ve completed a full sleep cycle before they\u2019re back to work. \u201cYou need at least one sleep cycle scientifically to be of any use, to keep your ability to operate safely, your decision making processes, your communication skills,\u201d says Major. Flight attendants need to be alert throughout the journey, so they will take it in turns to refuel via mid-flight power naps. Major says he finds sleeping in crew rest areas pretty easy, but he knows flight attendants who find it tough to sleep in beds that Major calls \u201ctechnically coffins.\u201d \u201cThere are some crew that really struggle with the bunks, they\u2019re not pleasant,\u201d says Major. \u201cYou push yourself right in, so they\u2019re long and thin, because they\u2019re up in the aircraft, so there\u2019s not a lot of space. They are like what you\u2019d imagine you\u2019d see on a submarine.\u201d Flight attendants will usually opt to get changed out of their uniform and into loungewear before squeezing into the bunks. Major says he always packs a T-shirt and some comfortable lounge pants. As he\u2019s a senior flight attendant, Major will hang his tie on the exterior of his bunk\u2019s curtain before he closes his eyes. \u201cSo that if there\u2019s any emergency whilst I\u2019m in the bunk, they know exactly which one I\u2019m in, even though there\u2019s usually one designated for the senior,\u201d Major explains. Do you have any tips on feeling fresh after sleeping on a plane? We\u2019ve all experienced waking up after a mid-flight sleep, groggily heading to the airplane bathroom to freshen up, and alarming yourself when you catch sight of your exhausted reflection. Major\u2019s top tip for feeling refreshed following inflight rest might sound obvious, but he insists it makes a world of difference. \u201cCleaning your teeth is always the one that freshens everybody up the most,\u201d he says, adding that flight attendants will always have between five and 10 minutes to freshen up before they\u2019re back on duty. That\u2019s enough time to get dressed, wash and, if you need to, comb hair and refresh makeup. Flight attendants will greet a returning colleague with a cup of tea or coffee. Then they\u2019ll head off duty for their own rest period. Should you exercise on a long-haul flight? Sitting in the same upright position for hours on end is uncomfortable, but it\u2019s not always easy to get up to stretch. The seat belt sign might be switched on, or you might want to avoid disturbing your seat neighbor. Major stresses that even just wiggling your toes while sitting in your seat is worthwhile. \u201cDo move around in your seat, move your legs, do what comes naturally \u2013 wiggle, move, get the blood flowing if that\u2019s what you need to do. For people that have got circulatory issues, talk to your doctor,\u201d he says. What\u2019s your perspective on passengers taking off their shoes? For many passengers, this is a controversial question due to concerns about smelly feet. But Major encourages anyone on a long-haul flight to remove shoes for comfort, and to help their circulation. Flight attendants don\u2019t care, he says. \u201cWe do it ourselves. I think most people do it themselves. It\u2019s the right thing to do if you\u2019re going on a long-haul flight,\u201d he says. \u201cOne would hope that you\u2019ve had the common decency to have a bath or a shower and put clean socks or stockings or tights on before you get on the aircraft. That\u2019s the only issue, if your feet smell.\u201d Major adds that it\u2019s polite, if you think there\u2019s a chance of feet odor, to \u201cgo to the washroom and do something about it.\u201d But flight attendants, he says, are more worried about passengers sticking out their feet into the aisle. \u201cOn a night flight particularly, if you put your feet in the aisle and you\u2019ve got dark socks on, we won\u2019t see you, and we\u2019ll trip over you, and it\u2019s a bit of a nuisance for us.\u201d What\u2019s the best seat to book for a long flight? If you\u2019re worried about turbulence, Major advises that you try to sit near the front of the aircraft. \u201cYou could be standing at the front and feel nothing, and down the back they\u2019re bouncing all over the place \u2013 the aircraft moves differently down the back,\u201d he explains. If you\u2019re tall, booking the emergency exit seat for the extra leg room could be worthwhile, although Major says it\u2019s worth remembering \u201cyou can\u2019t put your bags down at your feet or anything because it needs to be clear as an evacuation run.\u201d Airlines also sometimes charge extra for seats with leg room. Major\u2019s personal choice on a long-haul flight is booking a window seat. \u201cThat\u2019s purely preferential, I can lean up against the bulkhead, pull my head down and go to sleep. Whereas you can\u2019t when you\u2019re in the aisle seats or the middle seat,\u201d he says. The middle seat is never enviable, but it\u2019s perhaps particularly unappealing on a long flight. Major reckons it\u2019s worth paying extra for the aisle or window, especially \u201cif you need to sleep on the flight.\u201d Should I invest in noise-canceling headphones and bring my iPad on board? The way we consume TV and movies has changed drastically over the past decade, but inflight entertainment has largely stayed unchanged. While many of us still enjoy watching new movie releases on board flights, it\u2019s less of a novelty than it once was. Many passengers prefer binging a pre-downloaded streaming show on a personal device. \u201cMost people self-cater flights now when it comes to entertainment,\u201d says Major. Your own devices are also a good back-up in case there are issues with the in-flight entertainment system, which Major admits \u201cmight not always be working.\u201d Flight attendants usually have handbooks that advise how to operate the inflight screens, but they\u2019re not always able to fix the problem. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much we can do on the aircraft to kick it back to life if it starts to play up,\u201d says Major. \u201cThere\u2019s very little we can do, apart from the usual scientific \u2018turn it off, turn it on again.\u2019\u201d Most aircraft today have USB charging sockets, but a portable charger could also give you added piece of mind. As a flight attendant, do you judge passengers\u2019 movie choices? Major says in his experience, crew aren\u2019t paying too much attention to what you\u2019ve opted to watch on board, but occasionally he\u2019ll comment on a traveler\u2019s choice. \u201cWe can use it as an ice breaker,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I\u2019ve seen a movie and it\u2019s good, it\u2019s something to use to strike up conversation.\u201d Major does recall once noticing a Business Class passenger reading a book which included some graphic descriptions. \u201cThe words were pretty pornographic although I couldn\u2019t see enough to follow the thread,\u201d Major says. The man was reading the book quite openly, and made no attempts to hide the contents. \u201cI was quite shocked,\u201d says Major. \u201cTurned out we were taking a group of sex therapists to a conference.\u201d Should you bring your own food and snacks? Absolutely, says Major. \u201cOn most flights, people forget that you get on the plane, you\u2019re not going to eat for the first hour, at least \u2013 it\u2019s probably going to be an hour and a half after takeoff before you eat,\u201d he says. If you have a health condition like diabetes, bringing your own sustenance is particularly key. It\u2019s also important to pack snacks if you\u2019re traveling with kids. I\u2019m taking my kids on a long-haul flight, what should I do? Major has young kids of his own, so he says he can answer this question both as a father and as a flight attendant. \u201cIf you\u2019re tense, your child will be tense, it\u2019s as simple as that. If you\u2019re stressed, and you\u2019re feeling anxious, your child will be anxious,\u201d he says. Flight attendants are experienced at talking kids and parents through the flying process, Major adds. \u201cBecause we\u2019re just generally very relaxed, we can calm them down very quickly,\u201d he says. When babies are crying, parents are panicking and other passengers are sighing, Major says he\u2019ll always handle the situation in the same way. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s audible for everyone else to hear, I\u2019ll say: \u2018Please don\u2019t worry about it. Don\u2019t worry about your child crying. It\u2019s helping your child rebalance their ears. It\u2019s the only way they can do it, through screaming. We\u2019ve all been children, we\u2019ve all cried, don\u2019t worry about it.\u2019 I\u2019ll try to put the parents at ease. By putting the parent at ease, we can hopefully settle the child.\u201d Major says bringing favorite toys and blankets on the aircraft can also help calm a child, as it helps the alien airplane environment seem more familiar and comforting. How do you deal with nervous passengers on long-haul flights? Those with a fear of flying are, in Major\u2019s experience, worried about one of two things. Either it\u2019s the \u201clack of control\u201d and the \u201calien environment.\u201d Or it\u2019s fear of the airplane crashing. Some people are reassured by Major walking them through the mechanics of the aircraft \u2013 explaining that unknown engine noises are normal, or that air travel is generally very safe and there are many fail-safes in place. Others would rather not know the ins and outs, they just need distracting. Major once spent two hours on board a flight chatting with a nervous passenger in the galley, taking their mind off the situation. Even for those who aren\u2019t generally afraid of flying, long-haul journeys present their own set of pressure points that can drive people into panic mode. Crying babies might be viewed as more of an annoyance on a short flight, but passengers can \u201cfreak,\u201d as Major puts it, if they think that\u2019s set to be their soundtrack for the next 12 hours. Delays to any flights are frustrating, but on longer flights, delays can suddenly hammer home \u201cthe reality of distance and time,\u201d says Major. But Major says it\u2019s important to remember that \u201cthere\u2019s always taxiing time built into the flight time.\u201d \u201cYou can make up time on long-haul a lot easier than short-haul,\u201d he adds. \u201cYou can pick up a good half hour.\u201d What\u2019s your opinion on AirTags? Major\u2019s never used an AirTag, but he understands the attraction \u2013 especially for passengers who\u2019ve dealt with a lost bag in the past. Although it\u2019s a different story when he travels with his family, Major says he usually travels carry-on only, even on long-haul flights. That\u2019s less because he\u2019s worried about losing luggage, and more for ease and speed. \u201cOn my own, I\u2019ve got one bag that I can live for a week out of, it\u2019s so finely tuned,\u201d he says. \u201cI fly with hand luggage only so I can get through the airport as quickly as possible.\u201d If you\u2019ve got a layover, how should you maximize that time? If you\u2019ve got several hours before the next leg of your journey, it could be worth booking a hotel room to catch up on sleep, says Major, who also advises stretching your legs and walking around as much as possible. If there\u2019s enough time to leave the airport and get some fresh air, that\u2019s worth doing too. Major knows what he\u2019s talking about, he once did a mammoth journey with multiple airport layovers, \u201cfrom Cairns - Brisbane, Brisbane - Sydney, Sydney - Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi - Vienna, Vienna - Frankfurt, Frankfurt - [London] Gatwick.\u201d \u201cWhen I got off, I was nearly dead,\u201d he jokes. What\u2019s your perspective on the super long-haul flights that could be a thing of the future? The longest flight Major\u2019s ever worked was around 14 hours. The longest scheduled flight currently in operation is Singapore Airlines\u2019 New York to Singapore flight, which lasts 18 hours and 40 minutes. Australian airline Qantas is preparing to launch its ultra long-haul \u201cProject Sunrise\u201d flights, which would span upwards of 19 hours flying passengers from New York and London to Sydney, Australia. For flight attendants, Major says, that will involve working over periods in excess of 24 hours. \u201cYou\u2019re missing two nights of sleep,\u201d says Major. \u201cThe impact of that we don\u2019t fully understand.\u201d It\u2019s still early days, says Major, and these details need to be ironed out. But he sees ultra long-haul as the \u201cevolution of flying.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the aircraft to do it now, so we need to find ways of doing it,\u201d says Major. \u201cAnd we will. There\u2019s a lot of work going on to do that.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/flight-attendants-surviving-long-haul-flights/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_time-out-best-food-cities-2024", "text": "Some travelers pick a city break based on the destination\u2019s cultural offerings \u2013 shortlisting the best museums and galleries to visit. Others eye up cities with buzzy nightlife or opt for a destination hosting a festival or event. But for many vacationers, the most exciting part of any trip is the food. These are the travelers that wake up on the first day of the trip excited for all the culinary delights awaiting them: from sprawling markets offering local delicacies, to late-night street food, to independent restaurants serving distinctive dishes you won\u2019t forget any time soon. It\u2019s these gourmand travelers Time Out had in mind when the global media organization put together a new ranking of the world\u2019s best foodie cities. \u201cFood is everything when traveling,\u201d Grace Beard, Time Out\u2019s travel editor told CNN Travel. \u201cA good (or bad) meal can make or break a trip \u2013 it\u2019s usually one of the things we remember most.\u201d Coming in at number one on Time Out\u2019s list is the Italian city of Naples, the oft-rumored birthplace of pizza. Unsurprisingly, the cheesy delights of pizza margherita gets a shout out in Time Out\u2019s list as the city\u2019s \u201cmust-eat dish\u201d \u2013 but sumptuous pasta dish Neapolitan rag\u00f9 and sweet sfogliatella are also namechecked. To compile the round-up, Time Out surveyed thousands of citydwellers across the globe, quizzing these locals on the food options in their city, with a focus on quality and affordability. Time Out editors sifted through the results, including the highest-scoring city for each country in the resulting ranking. Pizza and more For travelers keen to sample authentic pizza in Naples, Time Out suggests heading to pizzeria Santa Maradona, located in the city\u2019s Spanish quarter. Santa Maradona\u2019s owner Andrea Viviani told CNN Travel it was a \u201cpleasure\u201d to be spotlighted by Time Out, although he added that \u201cconsidering Naples only as a food destination is truly a waste.\u201d \u201cFood is certainly an important part of our culture, but Naples is much, much more,\u201d said Viviani. \u201cThe idea of Santa Maradona is precisely this: to convey all the facets of Naples.\u201d Viviani\u2019s restaurant, he explained, is a celebration not just of pizza \u2013 but also football. It\u2019s named in honor of Argentinian soccer player Diego Armando Maradona, who played for the Naples team in the 1980s. While Viviani hopes travelers coming to Naples will enjoy more than just the food, he added that it\u2019s exciting that many travelers come to the city with \u201ca great desire to learn about our tradition and taste our fantastic pizzas.\u201d At number two on Time Out\u2019s list is the South African city of Johannesburg, with Time Out quoting Johannesburg food writer Thando Moleketi-Williams, who recommends the central neighborhood of Braamfontein and spots including wine bar Mamakashaka and Friends on De Beer Street, and restaurant and gallery space Artivist. Time Out declares the city\u2019s must-eat dish is kota sandwich, a stuffed bread featuring tasty ingredients such as potato chips, sausage, egg or cheese, and also spotlights bunny chow, a South African street food featuring curry, meat or beans stuffed inside bread. And rounding out Time Out\u2019s top three is Lima, Peru, where Time Out recommends visitors try signature dishes ceviche and arroz con pollo (chicken and rice). The city\u2019s Central restaurant, recently named as number one in the 2023 World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants awards, naturally gets a mention too. Prioritizing affordability Other cities on the list include Ho Chi Minh City (number four), Beijing (number five) and Bangkok (number six). The commonality between all the cities on the list is they\u2019re \u201cundergoing a culinary renaissance\u201d or they\u2019re \u201cparticularly buzzing right now, according to Time Out\u2019s Grace Beard. Beard told CNN Travel that \u201caffordability played as much a role as quality in creating this ranking\u201d and the editors were looking for cities \u201cwhere good-quality meals are accessible to travelers on every budget.\u201d The top US city on Time Out\u2019s ranking was Portland, Oregon \u2013 at number 10. According to Time Out, Portland is another must-visit spot for pizza lovers, with Mexican pizza \u2013 a pizza topped with taco ingredients \u2013 was named by locals as the city\u2019s best-value dish. In the UK, the city of Liverpool just missed out on a spot on Time Out\u2019s top 10, coming in at number 11. Time Out shouted out the city\u2019s signature city dish of Scouse \u2013 a rich stew usually comprised of beef or lamb \u2013 and what Liverpool-based writer Alice Porter calls a \u201cclutch of brand new foodie ventures,\u201d such as Manifest, a restaurant named in the Michelin Guide.

{"id": "2024_06_08_travel_europe-summer-2024-travel-crowds", "text": "Temperatures are rising. Hotel prices are exploding. And travelers are already behaving badly. Welcome to another summer in Europe. From the headlines, things already look chaotic. Famous sites are raising their entry fees. Hotel rooms are like gold dust. And the dollar has slipped against both the pound and the euro. Oh, and there\u2019s the small matter of crowds. \u201cThere\u2019s been a substantial increase on last year\u2019s demand,\u201d says Tom Jenkins, CEO of the European Tourism Organisation, speaking about US travelers to Europe. \u201c2023 saw higher numbers than 2019, and this year we\u2019re comfortably seeing more \u2013 record volumes of Americans coming to Europe.\u201d Kayla Zeigler agrees. As the owner of Destination Europe, she is sending \u201crecord numbers\u201d of clients to the continent this year. Graham Carter, director of Unforgettable Travel, a tour operator with a 90% US client base, says that many guests are finding the idea of Europe prohibitively expensive this year. \u201cPeople are wondering, is Europe worth it?\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s booking up in advance and prices are quite high. There\u2019s been such a huge demand for travel in the past three years, and lots of places are pushing up prices.\u201d Is summer in Europe already a washout? According to the experts, that all depends on what kind of sacrifices you\u2019re prepared to make. A weak dollar First things first: travelers from the US are already at a disadvantage due to a weak dollar. Against the euro, $1 was worth around 91 or 92 euro cents as of June 5, at mid-market rates. Sure, that\u2019s better than the December 2020-January 2021 five-year low when the dollar was hovering around 82 cents. But it\u2019s also down from a year earlier, when a dollar was worth about 95 euro cents \u2013 and it\u2019s way down from last September\u2019s five-year high when it peaked at 1.04 euros, according to currency conversion specialists Wise. For those traveling to the UK it\u2019s a similar state of affairs. This time last year, $1 netted travelers 80 pence. As of Wednesday, it was 78p \u2013 a fall from the September peak of nearly 83p. The dollar is also down, year on year, against 11 more European currencies. From Bosnia to Bulgaria, Denmark to Iceland, Poland to Romania and Sweden to Switzerland, travelers changing dollars will be worse off. While a few cents to the dollar doesn\u2019t sound much on a single transaction, the small drops can make a difference on credit card bills on the return home. A 500 euro hotel room equates to $543 at Friday\u2019s mid-market exchange rate, where it would have been $480 in September. It\u2019s not all bad, though. In Europe it is up against three currencies: the Czech koruna (21.9 koruna to the dollar last year, to 22.7 currently), the Hungarian forint (from 344.7 to the dollar last year, to 359.4 this year), and the Ukrainian hryvnia, though few will be considering Ukraine for a vacation this year. One currency the dollar is unusually strong against is the Turkish lira. Last June, visitors were swapping one dollar for 21 lira; this week, they\u2019re getting 32. \u2018Spectacular\u2019 hotel price hikes\u2026 On the ground, inflation is up, and entrance fees are rising. The Eiffel Tower will put up prices by 20% from June 17, Istanbul\u2019s Hagia Sophia now charges 25 euros for entry; Venice is charging day-trippers 5 euros on peak dates. Entry fees pale in comparison to hotel bills however. Jenkins says that prices have risen \u201cquite spectacularly\u201d in major cities, and Tim Hentschel, CEO of HotelPlanner.com, agrees. \u201cA lot of the time we\u2019re seeing hotels for $500 a night that were $300 last year,\u201d he says. However, that\u2019s not necessarily because hotels have randomly increased their prices. It\u2019s down to high occupancy levels, he says. As hotels fill up, their remaining rooms get more expensive. \u201cIt\u2019s become, how much can the hotel sell that last 10% of inventory. Rates really begin to spike because of compression,\u201d he says. \u201cSo once you hit 90% occupancy, a $350 room can spike to $500. It\u2019s not like the whole hotel sold at $500 \u2013 a lot sold at $250. It\u2019s the procrastinators paying $500.\u201d He should know \u2013 he\u2019s a self-described procrastinator. Data from Hotel Monitor, American Express Global Business Travel\u2019s annual analysis of worldwide hotel rates, backs his theory up. Its industry predictions for 2024 suggest many major European cities should see room rates increasing by around 10%. Paris, Amsterdam and Dublin were all predicted to be 10-11% higher, with Berlin, Stockholm, Barcelona and London all up by over 9%. Bottom line: stop procrastinating. The good news is that Hentschel says that these price hikes aren\u2019t across the board; instead, they\u2019re at the higher end. That\u2019s why his advice is to drop down the star ratings to find a good deal. \u201cOne and two star hotels don\u2019t have the pricing power,\u201d he says. The same goes for hotels a little further from the destination. \u201cGo to Murcia not Marbella, Milos instead of Mykonos,\u201d he says. \u201cYou get the same sunsets, the same Instagram pictures for a tenth of the price. These aren\u2019t downgrades \u2013 they are places that haven\u2019t made the top 10 list of Conde Nast for the past 10 years.\u201d If you\u2019re looking to stay in a city, try a town further out, he says. In London, for example, five stars are hitting as much as \u00a31,000 (about $1,270) per night. \u201cBut if you go outside the M25 (London\u2019s outer ringroad), three- and four-star hotels are having a tough time getting \u00a3100 a night.\u201d His top tip for London? Windsor, home to the royals and just 29 minutes by train from Paddington station. The sweet spot? A three star hotel in a secondary destination. That should net you a good deal \u2013 even in the terrible summer of 2024, he says. \u2026But cheaper airfares It may not feel like it, but US-Europe airfares are trending lower, says Hayley Berg, lead economist at Hopper. Her data \u2013 which collates all worldwide flight fare searches \u2013 shows that the average air fare from the US to Europe this summer is down 16% on 2023 to $892 round trip. In fact, she says, \u201cEurope is on sale this year.\u201d For the major destinations, it\u2019s even better. Hopper data from June shows that the average return flight from the US to London is down 21%, year on year. On the continent, prime destinations Rome, Barcelona, Athens, and Paris have all seen whopping double-figure drops: by 34%, 37%, 28% and 38% respectively for fares in June, July and August. None of these fares are exactly giveaways. Prices are still higher than in 2019, but are aligned with 2017 and 2018, suggesting that the wild post-pandemic price hikes might be over. Berg calls it \u201ca path back to normal prices.\u201d Far from the madding crowds Did someone mention the crowds? With numbers spiking and anti-tourism measures in place from Venice\u2019s daytripper fee to Mallorcan residents staging protests, some people want to stay away from the obvious European destinations. Jenkins speaks of a \u201csoftening in demand\u201d for the \u201cmain cultural cities.\u201d Carter\u2019s clients try to avoid July and August because of the crowds and heat, preferring May, June and September. But even in those less-busy months, crowds are a concern this year. \u201cWe\u2019re getting a lot of people wanting to avoid the Venices, Romes, Florences,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople are saying, \u2018We still want to visit Italy but we want to avoid the crowds.\u2019\u201d They\u2019re doing the right thing. 2023 saw 134 million \u201carrivals\u201d in Italy \u2013 the highest visitor numbers in history, according to data from Italy\u2019s tourism ministry. Half of those were foreign visitors, and the signs are that 2024 will surpass them, thanks to what tourism minister Daniela Santanch\u00e8 has called a \u201ctargeted strategy.\u201d Zeigler says that any client booking a popular destination this year is getting a reality check before they go. \u201cWe prepare our clients who are visiting tourist-heavy destinations about the crowds, and in many cases we plan their touring and activities around peak crowd times for them to try to have the most pleasant experience possible,\u201d she says, adding that she is booking them accommodation slightly outside of the prime locations: Praiano and Ravello, for example, instead of Amalfi and Positano, for those visiting the Amalfi Coast. Carter is sending his reluctant travelers to more rural regions, like Puglia and Sicily, or advising them to try a different country entirely \u2013 Slovenia instead of Italy (for its mountains and wineries) and Croatia instead of the Greek islands. Ireland and Portugal are also increasingly popular for his clients. Jenkins has a novel suggestion: France. Olympics host cities tend to see a drop in tourism around the Games, he says \u2013 and since Paris is the main attraction for visitors to France, he thinks regional France will be less busy than usual. His prediction appears to be coming true: although the Amex GBT analysis predicted a 11% spike in Paris hotel rates this year, so far they have only risen 8%. That 38% drop in airfare to the city\u2019s Charles de Gaulle airport is looking very tempting. For those sticking to the usual destinations, add-ons and activities are where travelers are really being hit this year, says Hentschel, who just booked an Amalfi Coast trip for a client \u2013 including a 60-minute massage for $400. \u201cTravel is at historic highs and inflation is high,\u201d he says. \u201cActivities have skyrocketed.\u201d They\u2019re also selling out fast \u2013 so if you\u2019re wanting to book, be quick. Zeigler says that on-the-ground costs are around 30% more than they were in 2019 for her clients. Is now too late? So is there still time to plan a European summer, or is it too late? Book that flight fast, advises Berg; prices are only going to go up. Or, \u201cIf you\u2019re flexible, go for September\u201d \u2013 she predicts a similar year-on-year fare drop in addition to the regular 10-30% autumn price fall. Alternatively, wait a year \u2013 Berg predicts that US-Europe fares will remain the same or go down for 2025. Hentschel advises late bookers to try \u201calternative accommodation\u201d \u2013 dropping a star rating, staying further away, or trying something like a B&B. Carter says that there are still \u201cpockets\u201d of availability in July and August but warns that clients shouldn\u2019t expect last-minute deals. But with refreshing honesty, he advises people to wait. \u201cI just wouldn\u2019t bother with summer \u2013 I\u2019d look at autumn 2024 or spring 2025 if you want to get some value out of the trip. \u201cI think summer this year, you\u2019re just going to get stung.\u201d As Hentschel says, \u201cThe further in advance you book, the more you save.\u201d As numbers continue to rise in Europe, make that your travel motto for the future.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/travel/europe-summer-2024-travel-crowds/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "travel"}}

Then, right before take off, Joel and Shelley sat side by side in the flight deck, just the two of them. They\u2019d come full circle, and were about to embark on an exciting new chapter. \u201cIt felt amazing,\u201d Shelley tells CNN Travel. \u201cAs we prepared to take off, I was giddy, euphoric,\u201d says Joel. Joel and Shelley met as twentysomethings flying jets in the US Air Force. They became fast friends, then, over time, fell in love. Today, they\u2019ve been married for 27 years and counting. They\u2019ve brought up two kids together. And now they\u2019re both pilots for Southwest Airlines. They regularly fly together, with Joel as captain and Shelley as first officer. The couple say working together is \u201camazing.\u201d They treat layovers as \u201cdate nights.\u201d They learn from one another\u2019s respective \u201cwisdom and judgment.\u201d And no, they don\u2019t argue mid-flight. \u201cPeople ask us, how does it work, flying together?\u201d says Joel. \u201cWe know a few pilot couples and some of them fly together, some of them don\u2019t. I\u2019ve heard people say, \u2018Oh I could never fly with my wife or my husband.\u2019\u201d For Joel and Shelley, working together is seamless \u2013 a joy that comes easily to them both. \u201cWe\u2019re best friends,\u201d says Shelley. \u201cThere\u2019s just that unspoken bond,\u201d says Joel. Inspired by \u2018Top Gun\u2019 Shelley grew up in Iowa and moved to Colorado \u2013 Joel\u2019s home state \u2013 as a teenager. The two spent their high school years unaware of one another, but they graduated the same year, and both opted to study at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado in the late 1980s. Joel says he was very influenced by the 1985 Tom Cruise movie \u201cTop Gun\u201d \u2013 \u201cwhich made flying jets look like a lot of fun.\u201d For Shelley, who was an athlete, the appeal of the Air Force Academy was less about flying \u2013 which she only really discovered once she was enrolled \u2013 and more an opportunity to play college basketball. \u201cI didn\u2019t attend the Academy to pursue flying, initially. Once I was there I realized it was a great opportunity for a fun and challenging career,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the introduction to flying there made me want to pursue it further.\u201d Joel and Shelley spent four years studying at the Air Force Academy without actually crossing paths, although Joel was vaguely aware of Shelley. \u201cThere\u2019s not that many women at the Air Force Academy, so I kind of knew who she was,\u201d he says. The two finally met a few years later, after they\u2019d both completed pilot training in different states. They got the same first assignment \u2013 flying Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft in Texas. When Shelley arrived in Texas, Joel had been there for a few months. \u201cSo I was there, kind of established, and she came into the office where I was working,\u201d he recalls. \u201cShe came in and turned in the paperwork, and we said, \u2018Hi,\u2019 just exchanged some pleasantries.\u201d Joel was struck by Shelley right away. \u201cShe\u2019s tall. She looks great. She left the room and this other coworker was just looking at me smiling. And I said, \u2018What?\u2019 And he could tell.\u201d Looking back, Joel thinks it was the \u201ceye contact\u201d he had with Shelley that gave his feelings away. Or maybe just \u201cthe look on my face.\u201d \u201cThere was something there,\u201d says Joel, smiling. \u201cBut I just kind of laughed it off. I was like, \u2018Nah, we\u2019re just going to be friends.\u2019\u201d Joel was also a bit intimidated by Shelley \u2013 he was \u201cattracted to her right away,\u201d but didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d ever be interested in him. \u201cShe\u2019s taller than me. And I had never dated anyone taller than me,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s an athlete, she\u2019s a natural leader, and just an impressive person.\u201d But Joel\u2019s warm nature appealed to Shelley. She felt comfortable around him right away. They became close friends. \u201cJoel has a really great sense of humor,\u201d says Shelley. \u201cI love that about him. And he just really has a sensitive heart to people, all people around him, he looks out for people.\u201d \u201cThat really attracted me to him. And also, he used to have a nice dark head of hair. I really liked that too. But he has a very distinguished look now, and he\u2019s just as handsome as ever.\u201d About a year after they first met, Joel and Shelley were deployed abroad, together. That\u2019s when they \u201ckind of started dating,\u201d as Joel puts it. While there wasn\u2019t much opportunity to go on actual dates on active service, they bonded. \u201cConversations, talking about everything, basically,\u201d says Shelley. \u201cWe really got to know each other\u2019s heart that way. And I think it just made it clear that this is what we were supposed to do.\u201d Back home in the US, the two \u201cstarted officially dating.\u201d \u201cWe just kind of knew that this was going to be it,\u201d says Joel. \u201cAnd within a few months, we got married.\u201d Joel and Shelley became instructor Air Force pilots in Mississippi. Then, in the early 2000s, Shelley gave birth to the couple\u2019s kids, two twins, a boy and a girl. Shelley left flying around this time, but she stayed in the military, working for the US Air National Guard. \u201cI wanted to be at home,\u201d says Shelley. The path to pregnancy wasn\u2019t easy for the couple and Joel calls their kids a \u201chuge blessing.\u201d \u201cWe went through in vitro a couple of times,\u201d he says. \u201cIt took a few years for us to actually get pregnant.\u201d The family relocated back to Colorado and Joel transitioned from military flying to commercial flying, becoming a pilot with Southwest Airlines in 2006. Returning to the air Cut to 2021. The pandemic years were tough going for Joel and Shelley, emotionally speaking. While the couple stayed healthy, their kids were in their late teens and struggled with the upheaval. Plus, Covid was impacting the aviation industry, so Joel was flying less. Around this time, Shelley left her job at the National Guard. She and Joel were wholly focused on their family and their kids\u2019 wellbeing. But in time, the pandemic waned and Joel started flying more regularly. Joel and Shelley\u2019s kids graduated high school and started the next phase of their lives. It was a transitional period for the Atkinson family, and in turn, Shelley started considering her future. She found herself dreaming about flying. She hadn\u2019t been behind the controls of a plane in over two decades, but she felt a call to return. She started wondering if, like Joel, she could become a commercial pilot. When Shelley voiced the idea to Joel, he was immediately enthusiastic. \u201cI said, \u2018Come fly with me,\u2019\u201d says Joel, joking \u201ccue the music.\u201d Then, by coincidence, later that day, Joel saw a social media post from his airline, Southwest, about a pilot who\u2019d taken a two decade break to raise a family, then returned to flying. \u201cShe literally had the same story as me,\u201d says Shelley. It felt like a sign. While Joel didn\u2019t know this other pilot directly, he was able to reach out to her via his work network and pass on contact details to Shelley, who subsequently texted the other pilot, asking for guidance and advice. Then, with encouragement from her new friend \u2013 plus Joel\u2019s wholehearted support \u2013 Shelley committed to returning to the skies full time. While Shelley had years of Air Force experience, she hadn\u2019t flown airplanes for 20 years. She had had to hit the books, take additional tests and ensure her qualifications were up to speed. But before long Shelley was hired by SkyWest Airlines, flying regional jets. Then she joined Joel at Southwest in 2023. \u201cIt was crazy. It happened way faster than I thought it would. It\u2019s been amazing,\u201d says Shelley. \u201cIt was meant to be,\u201d says Joel. Flying together Joel and Shelley credit their success as a co-pilot team to their nearly three decades of marriage, as well as years of co-parenting. \u201cRaising two teenagers during Covid, I tell people that was a lot harder than what we\u2019re doing now,\u201d says Joel. Plus, the two met as colleagues \u2013 so they know how to balance commitment to a job with enjoying each other\u2019s company. Still, as a married couple in the military, Joel and Shelley never flew in the same aircraft. \u201cThe military kind of frowns upon it,\u201d says Joel. \u201cIt\u2019s a little morbid, but they don\u2019t want you to both go down in a plane crash.\u201d No such guidelines exist in commercial aviation, and so once Shelley joined Southwest, she and Joel were able to work side by side. Joel\u2019s seniority allows him to regularly bid for flights with Shelley. And the two find Joel\u2019s years of commercial aviation experience pairs well with Shelley\u2019s fresh take. \u201cShe looks to me and relies on me for the experience that I have. But I also know that she is a very sharp person, she just went through a lot of training. So her knowledge is fresh. And she also has that wisdom and judgment,\u201d says Joel. Since the excitement of their first flight, Joel and Shelley tend not to \u201cmake a big deal\u201d about being a husband and wife pilot duo \u2013 unless it\u2019s preempted by their colleagues. \u201cWe wait for them to ask,\u201d says Shelley. As the couple share the same last name, often crew members put two and two together. As Joel\u2019s the more senior of the two, he often runs the pre-flight briefing. Sometimes he\u2019ll end it with a quick, throwaway: \u201cYes, we\u2019re married.\u201d The crew usually \u201cstart laughing,\u201d says Joel. When Joel and Shelley are taking off and landing, they\u2019re focused on the job at hand. \u201cIt\u2019s very technical,\u201d says Joel. \u201cWe\u2019re running checklists.\u201d But when the airplane reaches cruising altitude, \u201cthere\u2019s some downtime\u201d and Joel and Shelley will make the most of it, talking through their thoughts on life, their kids, their future plans and everything else that\u2019s on their mind. \u201cIt\u2019s so great, because all the years that I was flying, and she was at home, anything I wanted to talk to her about when I\u2019m up in the air, it had to wait,\u201d says Joel. \u201cYou\u2019re saving up conversations until you\u2019re home. It\u2019s like now we\u2019re making up for lost time.\u201d Then, when they land, Joel and Shelley make the most of the layovers. Southwest largely flies domestically, so the couple enjoy traveling the length and breadth of the US together. \u201cIt is a great job, because you go see different places and spend time in different cities,\u201d says Joel, but before Shelley joined Southwest, Joel says layovers sometimes felt like \u201cwasted time, because it was just me, and I couldn\u2019t share it with her.\u201d \u201cBut now we\u2019re together when we\u2019re on the road \u2013 it\u2019s so fun. Because every night on the road, it\u2019s a date night together,\u201d he says. Now, instead of counting the days until he\u2019s home, Joel says his \u201chome is right here\u201d because \u201cshe\u2019s with me.\u201d Family connection While Joel and Shelley have flown together countless times since Shelley joined Southwest, they\u2019ve yet to fly with their kids in tow. That\u2019s on the to-do list \u2013 plus, their son is also training to be a pilot, so there\u2019s a chance Shelley and Joel might pilot an aircraft with him in the future. For Shelley, an additional perk of the last couple of years is her adult kids getting to \u201cview her as a pilot for the first time.\u201d Shelley and Joel\u2019s children grew up knowing their parents met flying jets \u2013 but\u00a0while they saw their father regularly piloting airplanes for Southwest, they never saw Shelley flying. Shelley is really happy her children get to see her doing a job she loves. Shelley\u2019s also proud to be a female pilot in an industry that\u2019s still very male-dominated. She hopes to inspire other people, especially mothers who may have taken a break from the workplace to raise a family, by demonstrating that returning to a passion is possible. \u201cI hope it encourages other women that there is this opportunity out there \u2013 you can come back and you can still do it,\u201d she says. Shelley says she\u2019s really loved rediscovering her love of flying. \u201cThe view from 36,000 feet is pretty awesome,\u201d she says. \u201cFlying over parts of the country - I just love looking down and going, \u2018Oh, what town is that?\u2019\u201d Shelley and Joel particularly enjoy flying in and out of San Diego, California, but they also love it when Southwest takes them to New York. Before Christmas, they enjoyed a stopover in New York City and went searching for the settings of their favorite movies, from \u201cElf\u201d to \u201cSerendipity.\u201d \u201cI love traveling, seeing new places,\u201d says Joel, who adds that he\u2019s gone from avoiding working weekends to voluntarily signing up for Saturday and Sunday flight shifts. He and Shelley now spend Saturday nights watching jazz in Portland, going on hikes in Sacramento or drinking cocktails in Palm Springs. Joel\u2019s always loved flying \u2013 especially what he calls \u201cthe art and science\u201d of aviation. He also loves \u201cserving people, getting them to where they need to be,\u201d but he admits flying during the pandemic was hard going. For Joel, having Shelley now by his side at work has \u201cbeen just a complete turnaround.\u201d Now even the ride to work is fun as the couple car share, coffees in hand. Joel and Shelley, who post about their adventures on their Instagram account @luvpilots, are currently planning to pick up a flight together on Valentine\u2019s Day. Joel bought the two of them heart-printed ties especially \u2013 they\u2019re \u201csilly, but fun,\u201d says Joel. The couple enjoy chronicling their travels on social media \u2013 celebrating their marriage, their respective careers and their adventures. \u201cWe feel blessed. We\u2019re thankful for the opportunity,\u201d says Joel. \u201cWe\u2019re thankful to Southwest Airlines for letting us do this together.\u201d \u201cIf you love doing something, why not do it with the person you love?\u201d says Shelley.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/married-southwest-pilots/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_travel_star-wars-hotel-disney-jenny-nicholson-cec", "text": "In 2023, Disney closed a highly-publicized luxury hotel on the Walt Disney World property called \u201cStar Wars: Galactic Starcruiser.\u201d For Disney superfans, it was a time of high drama and schadenfreude as promises about the hotel\u2019s immersive world ran aground on the rocky reality of some guests\u2019 experiences. Now, a year later, a four-hour-long YouTube deep-dive has resurfaced details about the concept and spread the niche piece of Disney lore to millions of viewers. The creator of the video, YouTuber Jenny Nicholson, is known for her commentary on various corners of fan culture. Some of her most popular videos cover shows and movies like \u201cThe Vampire Diaries,\u201d \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d and installments in the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise. None of them are nearly as long as her most recent video, \u201cThe Spectacular Failure of the Star Wars Hotel.\u201d Over the course of 20 video chapters, Nicholson details her 2022 stay at the \u201cStar Wars: Galactic Starcruiser\u201d hotel in Orlando, Florida. The tale is likely familiar to Disney and Star Wars fans, many of whom heard about the high-dollar, high-concept hotel and its closure in 2023. Nicholson says she paid more than $6,000 for a two-night stay in the hotel, which was supposed to resemble a Star Wars-style spaceship called the Halcyon. The big draw of the hotel lay in what Disney marketing called an \u201cimmersive, customizable Star Wars experience\u201d that Nicholson equated to LARPing, or live-action roleplaying. Guests were encouraged to dress up, and through a combination of live experiences with cast members and choices made in a special app, were guided through a three-day-long Star Wars storyline complete with full itinerary and, if played to its full extent, very little downtime. With Disney-esque details like working lightsabers and colorful themed food, the experience was supposed to feel like a \u201clandlocked cruise,\u201d with all of the entertainment happening onboard the ship \u2014 in reality, a large ultra-secure windowless building near Walt Disney World\u2019s Epcot resort area. Nicholson\u2019s experience squared with some more critical reviews of the hotel: Cramped rooms, inconsistent experiences with technology and a general sense of confusion as to the purpose or audience of the venture. (She also mentioned, at length, some of the things she enjoyed, like cast member performances and details in the ship-hotel\u2019s interior.) Little of this is new information. Disney announced the closing of the Galactic Starcruiser in May 2023, and the hotel served its last guests last September. In a press release provided to CNN from that time, Disney said the project \u201cgave us the opportunity to try new things.\u201d \u201cStar Wars: Galactic Starcruiser is one of our most creative projects ever and has been praised by our guests and recognized for setting a new bar for innovation and immersive entertainment,\u201d the statement read. \u201c\u2026 we will take what we\u2019ve learned to create future experiences that can reach more of our guests and fans.\u201d Still, Nicholson\u2019s video netted more than 2 million views in two days, and has already wormed its way into the social media pipeline of memes and references. Some X users marveled at the fact that they willingly watched a double feature-length video about, as one user said, something they \u201cpreviously never gave a s*** about in my life.\u201d Why yesterday\u2019s drama draws today\u2019s audience Longform videos are an increasingly popular form of YouTube entertainment, and it isn\u2019t unusual to see older topics being reexamined in multi-hour \u201cdeep dives.\u201d Nicholson\u2019s video also combines several winning formulas into one: Disney, Star Wars, insider information (Nicholson includes pictures and videos from her time in the hotel) and, of course, failures. \u201cI couldn\u2019t care less about some dumb Star Wars hotel, but give me those 4 hours,\u201d one X user said. Consumer research from Google claims that longform videos are gaining traction among younger viewers and, interestingly, are even more successful when they cover \u201cfan culture\u201d content. \u201cThere is a healthy appetite for more in-depth exploration of topics such as film, TV, and sports,\u201d a 2022 Google consumer insights report reads. \u201cThese allow for fan-centric creators to share thoughts and ideas at length with an increasingly captive audience: 61% of Gen Z would describe themselves as a \u201creally big\u201d or \u201csuper fan\u201d of someone or something.\u201d Both Star Wars and Disney enjoy particularly loyal fandoms with elephant memories and no qualms about engaging the same topics over and over again. Even the tiniest details in a Star Wars movie or a Disney theme park have cult followings, backstories, fan lore and, of course, their own video deep dives. A spotlight on Disney\u2019s future Nicholson\u2019s video, while not exactly breaking news, drops as Disney prepares a new slate of innovations. Earlier this year, Disney announced a massive 10-year, $60 billion expansion program for its parks, cruises and experiences worldwide. That includes a planned 14-acre expansion at the Magic Kingdom in Orlando\u2019s Walt Disney World and an expansion of the original Disneyland in Anaheim. The company recently got final approval from Anaheim\u2019s city council to move forward with DisneylandForward, a nearly $2 billion investment in the Disneyland resort and surrounding areas. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to build on decades of innovation, creativity, and storytelling to bring new, exciting experiences for our guests,\u201d Disneyland Resort President Ken Potrock wrote in a blog post announcing the approval of the project. In April, Disney CEO Bob Iger said expansion plans for Walt Disney World are on track after the settlement of a long legal battle between Disney and the state of Florida. Iger said the decision \u201cwill actually enable us to pursue the kind of significant investment in our Florida parks.\u201d Disney enthusiasts are expecting a trove of new information this August, when the company hosts its annual D23 Expo that focuses on upcoming projects and attractions. While the Galactic Starcruiser hotel has now earned a place in the annals of Disney lore, renewed interest in its failure provides a new lens through which to see Disney Parks\u2019 ambitions and expansions. Will they live up to everyone\u2019s wildest dreams, or be the subject of the next four-hour YouTube deep dive?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/travel/star-wars-hotel-disney-jenny-nicholson-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_travel_library-book-1939-late-scli-intl", "text": "There\u2019s nothing like getting lost in a good book, but one reader in Finland seems to have taken that to an extreme. Staff at a public library in Helsinki were rather surprised when a copy of Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s \u201cThe Refugees\u201d was returned to them more than eight decades after its due date. The novel, which is a Finnish translation of the English original, was received at Helsinki Central Library Oodi\u2019s lobby on Monday - more than 84 years after its due date of December 26, 1939. The returned book contained the borrower\u2019s library card, leading staff to believe that the original patron who took out the book was a businessman from the Pursimiehenkatu area of the Finnish capital. Librarian Heini Strand, who received the book at the library, told CNN in an email Friday: \u201cThe one who returned the book didn\u2019t tell - and we didn\u2019t ask - what was their relation to the one who originally loaned the book.\u201d Strand added: \u201cWe get these kinds of returnings that are tens of years late every once in a while, and many times they are books that friends and family find when they go through the belongings of a deceased relative. I don\u2019t know if this was the case with this book.\u201d The timing of the due date could be crucial in trying to explain why the book was never returned - the Soviet Union attacked Finland on November 30, 1939. Strand said: \u201cThe winter war had started just a month before the due date, so probably returning of a library loan wasn\u2019t the first thing on the loaners mind at the due date.\u201d The copy was in reasonably good shape considering its age and may now return to circulation for public borrowing. Strand said that the library already has two copies of the book in its collection, adding: \u201cWe sent the book to the book storage of Helsinki city library\u2019s main library which is in Pasila. \u201cThe people working there can decide whether to take it in to the collection or not. If it\u2019s taken in, then library customers can reserve it online and loan the book.\u201d The maximum penalty for an overdue book at the Helsinki library is \u20ac6 ($6.50) but no fine is being levied as the book was no longer in the library\u2019s system, which had changed many times since it was initially borrowed. Siina Tiuraniemi, a librarian colleague of Strand, told CNN: \u201cOur purpose is not to guard the books, we are here to promote reading and enable access to books and knowledge to everyone. The library is a very humane place, and people in Finland use the libraries a lot and understand how they work. Library books belong to all of us and late returns are not a big problem.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/travel/library-book-1939-late-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_stood-up-met-love-of-life-chance-encounters", "text": "When the guy she\u2019d met on the plane asked her out, Cristina Farina said yes without hesitation. Cristina had spent much of the flight to London from her Italian hometown Florence deep in conversation with this stranger. He seemed friendly, interesting, interested. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we meet tomorrow, go have a coffee, spend some time together?\u201d he suggested. \u201cLet\u2019s meet at 11 on Trafalgar Square.\u201d Upon landing at Heathrow Airport, Cristina and her plane crush went their separate ways, vowing to meet the next day. It was August 26, 1984. They didn\u2019t swap addresses or contact numbers. Texting wasn\u2019t an option. They just had to hope they\u2019d both keep their promise and be there the following day. Cristina grabbed her bag from the luggage carousel and headed into central London, feeling invigorated and excited. She was 18 years old, set to spend three months in the UK studying English. It was Cristina\u2019s first significant period away from home. Possibility stretched out before her. \u201cI loved London,\u201d Cristina tells CNN Travel today. \u201cIt gave me a lot of energy. I felt free to do what I wanted.\u201d The next day, shortly before 11 a.m., Cristina climbed the steps out of Charing Cross tube station and arrived in Trafalgar Square \u2013 an open, pedestrianized spot home to fountains, the UK\u2019s National Gallery and the imposing Nelson\u2019s Column, guarded by four large bronze lions. Trafalgar Square\u2019s almost always busy, and that day in 1984 was no different. Crowds of tourists dodged low flying pigeons as they lined up for entry to the gallery. Outside the South African embassy, protestors were opposing apartheid. It was sunny, with a warm breeze, and there were plenty of sunbathers sitting on the gallery steps and dotted around the square. Cristina searched for her airplane date among the throngs of people. There was no sign of him, but she was a bit early. Time ticked on. He was still nowhere to be seen. \u201cThe guy never showed up,\u201d says Cristina today. Getting stood up wasn\u2019t exactly how Cristina had imagined beginning her London adventure. She was a bit disheartened. She had no way of contacting her plane crush. But while waiting for him to show, she\u2019d had plenty of time to scan the other people in Trafalgar Square that day. And one person in particular had caught her eye. \u201cI saw this guy sitting in between the lions,\u201d Cristina recalls. \u201cHe caught my attention because he was good looking \u2013 long hair, kind of a hippyish look.\u201d He was leaning on the plinth between the bronze lions, reading a book. As Cristina got closer, she saw it was a copy of William Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cRomeo and Juliet.\u201d The guy was also listening to a walkman. As Cristina approached, he took off his headphones, looked up and smiled. \u201cHi,\u201d Cristina said. \u201cHi,\u201d he replied. Feeling bold, Cristina sat down next to the stranger. He looked a little surprised, but he put down his book and smiled at her again. \u201cThen we just started talking,\u201d says Cristina today. Two days in London The guy leaning on the Trafalgar Square lions was 20-year-old Matt Reinecke, an American college student on vacation with his family, visiting from California. It turned out Matt had spotted Cristina before she approached him. \u201cWhy does this pretty girl keep looking at me?\u201d he thought. Then, when Cristina spoke to him, then sat down next to him, Matt was thrilled. \u201cI was traveling, and I knew that I was leaving in two days. And then a cute girl sat down next to me \u2013 that was enough for me,\u201d he tells CNN Travel today. Matt and Cristina introduced themselves, and Cristina gestured to Matt\u2019s walkman, asking what he\u2019d been listening to. Matt explained he was a huge fan of the Grateful Dead \u2013 he\u2019d been to several of their tour dates in the US. Then, Matt asked Cristina what brought her to London, and she spoke about her excitement about her upcoming three months away from home. There was a bit of a language barrier \u2013 Cristina couldn\u2019t always understand Matt\u2019s Americanisms \u2013 she was more used to British English. But the connection between them was palpable right away. \u201cI liked him immediately,\u201d says Cristina. For the next two hours, Matt and Cristina sat, side by side, in Trafalgar Square, talking. At some point, Matt got out his camera and took a photo of Cristina, leaning against the monument, looking at him. Eventually, Matt had to leave to meet his parents. \u201cBut what are you doing later today?\u201d he asked Cristina. \u201cWant to meet for a drink?\u201d Matt and Cristina made plans to meet a few hours later. Matt\u2019s family was staying at Claridge\u2019s, the historic, swanky five star hotel in Mayfair. He told Cristina he\u2019d meet her outside Bond Street Station. Unlike Cristina\u2019s would-be airplane date, Matt showed up. Matt\u2019s parents knew he was going on a spontaneous date. They were also having a drink at a different spot on Bond Street, and asked Matt if he\u2019d walk by with Cristina, so they could take a peek and wave hello. Matt and Cristina obliged, giggling as they walked by and saw Matt\u2019s parents\u2019 curious but friendly faces. Then, sitting in a pub together, Matt and Cristina picked up where they\u2019d left off. They shared their first kiss. Cristina left the pub in a daze. She and Matt had made plans to meet again. He only had one more day left in London, but wanted to spend it with Cristina. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait,\u201d Cristina recalls. \u201cI was really looking forward to seeing him the next day.\u201d The next day, the sun was also shining. Cristina and Matt headed to Hyde Park. \u201cWe really just kissed and talked all day in the park,\u201d recalls Matt. This time, Cristina took a photo of Matt, on her camera. In the picture he\u2019s smiling, looking away from the camera, wearing his Grateful Dead t-shirt. Matt\u2019s flight wasn\u2019t until the evening, so he put off leaving for as long as possible. When he finally said goodbye, Matt passed Cristina a note. \u201cDon\u2019t open it until you get home,\u201d he told her. Cristina obliged. She was staying with a host family organized by the language school. She waited until she got back to her room and unfurled the paper. \u201cThe note said, \u2018I can\u2019t bear the thought of never seeing you again,\u2019\u201d recalls Cristina today. She remembers welling up. \u201cI knew I was going to see him again. And I knew I was going to spend time with him somewhere, somehow.\u201d Lost letters Despite that feeling of certainty, Cristina still felt heartbroken. And she felt lonely. She wished her girlfriends from Italy were close by so she could talk through her emotions. Instead, dug out some paper from her bag and wrote a long letter to her best friend back home, telling her about Matt, about their whirlwind romance. \u201cI was completely wrapped up in these two days I spent with him,\u201d says Cristina. The next day, the woman Cristina was staying with noticed her bloodshot eyes and asked Cristina what was wrong. In the absence of anyone else to speak to, Cristina confided in her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll see him again,\u201d said Cristina\u2019s host. \u201cDo you have his address?\u201d Cristina did have \u2013 scrawled on a piece of paper \u2013 Matt\u2019s college address. He was still traveling around Europe with his parents, and wouldn\u2019t be back there for a while. But Cristina wrote him a letter anyway. And while she didn\u2019t receive a reply right away, Cristina settled into her London life. The feeling of heartbreak faded a little, and she made friends. \u201cI had a wonderful time,\u201d she recalls. Matt was still in the back of her mind. Weeks passed, and she didn\u2019t hear from him. She sent another letter. Still nothing. Surely he was back at school by now? Maybe she had the wrong address? \u201cSo I tried to find out his parents\u2019 address instead,\u201d recalls Cristina. \u201cI knew they\u2019d been staying at Claridge\u2019s, so I contacted Claridge\u2019s, asking for the address. Of course, they couldn\u2019t give me the address of the parents. But they told me, \u2018Send the letter to us, and we\u2019ll forward it to them.\u2019 So that\u2019s what happened.\u201d It turned out Matt hadn\u2019t received Cristina\u2019s first letters. \u201cI was a university student, so I was changing apartments every year,\u201d he explains today. \u201cAnd then they would never forward the mail.\u201d Cristina\u2019s idea of writing to Matt\u2019s parents\u2019 address was a good one. \u201cFinally, he got all my letters,\u201d says Cristina. And eventually, when Cristina was back in Italy, Matt\u2019s reply arrived: \u201cFour pages folded into one small envelope that had me very emotional and excited,\u201d as Cristina recalls. \u201cI locked myself in my room and read it slowly over and over again.\u201d Even with correct addresses established, Cristina remained the driving force behind their keeping in touch. It wasn\u2019t that Matt wasn\u2019t interested \u2013 he thought about Cristina often, daydreaming about those magical two days in London. But letter writing didn\u2019t come naturally to him in the same way it did her. Still, over the next two years, Cristina and Matt kept up a epistolery correspondence. A couple of times, they spoke on the phone but \u201cvery rarely,\u201d because of the steep transatlantic phone costs. And even as months, then years passed without them seeing one another, Cristina and Matt believed they would one day reunite, just as Matt promised in the note he\u2019d given Cristina when he left London. \u201cI knew I was going to come back,\u201d says Matt. \u201cI had the certainty that I was going to see him again,\u201d says Cristina. As time went on, their letters became more detailed. Matt would send Cristina his sociology college essays and Cristina loved this, getting to see how Matt\u2019s brain worked, getting a glimpse into his political views, his perspective on the world. And while Cristina\u2019s early letters were \u201cmainly about my daily life, my friends, my family, my travels,\u201d as time went on, she \u201cwrote about my feelings, my dreams.\u201d \u201cThe letters became more important as our relationship grew, as we got to know each other over time,\u201d says Matt. Reuniting in Florence 1986 rolled around. In a letter, Matt told Cristina he was planning to visit Europe that summer. His goal was to get to Greece, but \u2013 if it was okay with Cristina and her family \u2013 he\u2019d plan a stop off in Florence, where Cristina lived with her parents. \u201cI was super excited,\u201d says Cristina. \u201cA bit nervous because he had to meet my family, but overall I was the happiest girl on Earth.\u201d Cristina\u2019s parents knew about her London romance. They saw the way she reacted to the arrival of Matt\u2019s letters. They were still a little skeptical about the whole thing. And when Matt arrived at their home \u2013 in clothes crumpled from traveling and with long hair \u2013 they were even more skeptical. \u201cBut eventually they started to like him,\u201d says Cristina. \u201cHe was a good influence in my family \u2013 he was fun, he made people laugh. He didn\u2019t speak a word of Italian. But he started to speak slowly, by learning slowly, by listening to my parents and my brother, who was a couple years younger than I was.\u201d In the end, Matt never made it to Greece. Instead, he spent three months with Cristina in Italy. Matt says their reunion was an exciting, romantic \u201cblur.\u201d \u201cIt was a dream,\u201d says Cristina. \u201cIt was a movie type of thing.\u201d At the end of the summer, Matt returned to the US to finish college. Later that year, Cristina visited him in California. In summer 1987, Matt graduated college and headed straight to Italy to see Cristina. He got a job as an English teacher in Florence, found an apartment in the city and ended up living there for the next 18 months. After years of long distance, Matt and Cristina were finally in the same country. They weren\u2019t just pen pals, they were finally dating. \u201cThat\u2019s when we decided, we\u2019re going to live together forever,\u201d says Matt. \u201cI was still only 21, I was very young,\u201d says Cristina. \u201cBut I was very convinced that he was for me.\u201d Still, the future was still a bit uncertain. Matt felt like his teaching job was more of a stop gap than a permanent career. And Cristina had loved California when she\u2019d visited Matt the year before. Living there became a goal for them both. So Matt returned to the US in early 1989 and went back to college, getting another degree in sociology and economics. And in 1990, Cristina followed him to California. A California chapter Cristina\u2019s parents had grown to love Matt, but they were a bit worried about their daughter relocating across the world. \u201cBut they understood that it was time to try and see if things would work out,\u201d says Cristina. Meanwhile, Matt\u2019s parents were supportive, but they were from wealthy Californian society, and Matt reckons they\u2019d always imagined him meeting a girl at a San Francisco debutante ball. \u201cMy parents were more wanting me to be a part of upper class San Francisco life, and not running off to Italy,\u201d says Matt. \u201cWe were from different backgrounds,\u201d says Cristina. \u201cMy family was a normal middle class Italian family.\u201d Despite their differences, Matt and Cristina\u2019s time together in California felt like a turning point. They got their own apartment and for the first time, it felt like they were \u201cfree of outside, external things like parents, family, different things.\u201d They could be \u201cjust Matt and Cristina as a couple,\u201d as Matt puts it. Matt worked long hours at an investment bank, but even though his job was full-on, the couple made the most of their time together. Their apartment was always full of friends. They went out in San Francisco regularly. They grew closer and more sure of their future together. \u201cThe relationship had already been building, but really it just blossomed in San Francisco,\u201d says Matt. \u201cIt was a wonderful time of our lives, you\u2019re in your mid to late 20s, we\u2019re living on Union Street, one of the most beautiful neighborhoods of San Francisco. We had so many friends.\u201d Matt and Cristina were committed to a future together, but the decision to get married came about rather suddenly. In 1991, Cristina received a letter from US immigration giving her two weeks to leave the country. And so on April 12, 1991 Matt and Cristina got married in San Francisco\u2019s City Hall with only Matt\u2019s mother and a few friends present. But they planned a big wedding celebration for later that year in Italy, at the 13th century Sant\u2019Angostino Church in Prato, Tuscany. \u201cOur wedding day was a lot of fun,\u201d recalls Cristina. The service was entirely in Italian. By then, Matt was pretty proficient in the language, but some of his relatives were a bit confused. Despite the language barrier, they couldn\u2019t fail to interpret the happiness on Matt and Cristina\u2019s faces, and the joy that emanated through the day. \u201cIt was a beautiful wedding,\u201d says Matt. New adventures In the summer of 1993, Matt and Cristina embarked on a new adventure together. They quit their jobs in the US and spent half a year traveling \u2013 visiting Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Australia. Then, at the end of that traveling period, the couple left California behind and moved to Italy. \u201cWe decided to try to move back to Europe, to see if Italy works for us,\u201d says Cristina. \u201cWe said, \u2018Okay, let\u2019s do it,\u2019 without thinking too much.\u201d In Italy, Matt and Cristina settled first in Milan, where they welcomed their first child, Davide, in 1997. Later, Matt\u2019s investment banking work later took them to Turin, where their daughter Francesca was born in 2003. In the mid-noughties, Matt and Cristina moved to Tuscany. They liked the idea of being closer to Cristina\u2019s parents. And after decades spent living in big cities, the Tuscan countryside was a welcome change of pace. The couple bought a run down 1600s farmhouse and focused on restructuring the house and making it into a family home. They were also kept busy by work. From 2008 until 2019, Matt and Cristina ran an American bakery in Florence, called Mama\u2019s Bakery. \u201cI think I\u2019ve made somewhere between 400,000 to 500,000 bagels,\u201d says Matt. \u201cI was the bagel king of Italy for a while.\u201d Running the business together was hard work, but rewarding. \u201cWe were a good team, we complemented each other,\u201d says Matt. \u201cIt is really difficult on family time, but we often had fun together at work. I am happy we had the experience, but I am happier that we sold the business.\u201d Life today Matt and Cristina left Mama\u2019s Bakery behind in 2019. Now, they\u2019re retired, and their focus is on traveling, spending time with their kids and enjoying their home in Tuscany. \u201cWe do exactly what we want to do,\u201d says Cristina. \u201cWe\u2019re fortunate we can do that,\u201d says Matt. After years of working and living in Italy, Matt\u2019s fluent in Italian. Matt and Cristina\u2019s children are bilingual. \u201cOur conversation in the house switches back and forth between English and Italian mid-sentence,\u201d says Matt. \u201cWho would have ever thought that I\u2019d live half my life in Italy? It\u2019s weird how just a brief second can change things in a wonderful way.\u201d For Matt and Cristina, it\u2019s surreal but special to reflect on their first meeting in Trafalgar Square, 40 years ago this year. They\u2019ve since returned to London with their kids, taking them to the spot by the lions where they first started talking. \u201cI was emotional when we were there together,\u201d says Cristina. It was a random meeting, spurred on by another random meeting \u2013 who knows what would have happened if Cristina\u2019s original airplane date had turned up that day. Although Cristina and Matt think fate played a role, looking back they\u2019re also proud that they worked to stay in touch, Cristina\u2019s proud of her spontaneity and determination, and Matt\u2019s proud of his willingness to take risks. \u201cLife is amazing,\u201d says Matt. \u201cIt is crazy just how absurd things can be. Be careful out there. You might find happiness in the strangest of places if you look at it right.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/stood-up-met-love-of-life-chance-encounters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_article_breakfast-tacos-origins-mexico-texas", "text": "Two simple words can spark mouth-watering bliss or a series of blistering retorts in Texans: Breakfast tacos. In the Lone Star State, who gets the credit for these morning tortilla sensations can be a matter of haba\u00f1ero-hot debate. A highly contested Eater article in 2016 helped start a full-on Breakfast Taco War between Austin and San Antonio. While that particular battle eventually settled down, flare-ups continue. But to get a true picture of this simple food with a complex history, we must go beyond Texas and first look at another place: Mexico. Mouthwatering tacos in Monterrey The breakfast taco is actually part of a long parade of foods (pizza, for instance) whose fuzzy origins and various claims of authenticity spark ferocious debate. There\u2019s one thing we know for darn sure: Today, breakfast tacos are enjoyed on both sides of the Rio Grande River. In her CNN \u201cSearching for Mexico\u201d series, actor Eva Longoria traveled to Monterrey in the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n.     There, she enjoyed a breakfast taco with Mexican food bloggers Gerardo Alvarado and Ernesto Esquivel at Tacos Do\u00f1a Mary La Gritona, which has been serving central Monterrey for nearly 20 years.  \u201cThe breakfast taco may be the simplest of street food, but it\u2019s been been hitting the spot for the workers of Monterrey for nearly a century,\u201d narrates Longoria. \u2018Not a junkie food\u2019   CNN Travel caught up with Esquivel \u2013 born and raised in the border state of Sonora and resident of Monterrey for more than 10 years \u2013 to find out more. \u201cWhen I arrived in Monterrey, I discovered all the different types of tacos that everyone eats in the morning. You can have a taco of eggs. You can have a taco of meat. You can have a taco of potatoes.\u201d Esquivel describes breakfast tacos as \u201ca really fast food, but not a junkie food.\u201d  Esquivel said you can find breakfast tacos in other states in northern Mexico, but Monterrey and the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n are the culinary epicenter with more places to get them and a larger selection of fillings.  Some of the city\u2019s favorites are the machacado (dried beef) with eggs, the barbacoa (slow-cooked meat, often in a pit) and the deshebrada (shredded beef). In other words, you\u2019re in meat country. Timeline of the breakfast taco Esquivel said the breakfast taco goes back to the early 1900s and perhaps even earlier in Monterrey.  Compa\u00f1ia Fundidora, a former iron and steel foundry that dates to 1900 but is now a recreational and educational park, helped the breakfast taco get its start in Monterrey. Employees came \u201cto work really early, and so they had to have a really fast breakfast in the morning, and one fast breakfast in the morning is a breakfast taco.\u201d  And from there, the tacos spread into southern Texas, Esquivel said, which is reflected in the cuisine of today. \u201cI think the flavors here in Monterrey, mostly in the north, are similar to some flavors in Texas.\u201d Along with Do\u00f1a Mary\u2019s, he suggests these spots for a breakfast taco if you\u2019re in Monterrey: Tacos Rafa Ahogados, Tacos Piedra and Tony\u2019s Tacos. North of the Rio Grande   The river may mark a political line between two nations, but it has been no barrier at all to crossings of cuisine and culture. And Texas also shares a passion for the breakfast taco. You can tell that just from all the kerfuffles about them. \u201cNo Texas city can claim the breakfast taco,\u201d says Jos\u00e9 Ralat, the taco editor of Texas Monthly magazine. He places the ultimate credit south of the Rio Grande. \u201cIt comes from Mexico \u2013 where exactly, it\u2019s not really known. Geographically, the most likely source is northern Mexico. There is no literature that I have seen that can point to any particular city in northern Mexico.\u201d As for today, \u201cthey\u2019re popular in [the Mexican states of] Tamaulipas, Nuevo Le\u00f3n and Coahuila, which all border Texas,\u201d he said. Eddie Vega \u2013 who grew up in McAllen, across from the Mexican city of Reynosa in Tamaulipas state \u2013 is known as \u201cTaco Poet of Texas.\u201d He points out that historically, what\u2019s now south Texas was once part of Mexico.  Before 1836, \u201cthe border was further north. All this region was eating a combination of indigenous and Spanish food together.\u201d Vega said that growing up, breakfast tacos weren\u2019t some trendy food to him attracting attention from the likes of The New York Times and other coastal media. \u201cWhen you get to south Texas, and I\u2019m from the Valley, we had breakfast tacos, but they were in my house. My mom would make them. It\u2019s not something we\u2019d go to a restaurant to get because economically that region is very poor and nobody\u2019s eating out. Or not eating out in the morning especially.\u201d Enter Austin Ralat and Vega both said the breakfast taco was staple deep in south Texas and then San Antonio long before Austin got in on the action. So how did Austin become so synonymous with them? Austin has \u201ca great branding mentality, they have a knack for PR. Every year, Austin is flooded with coastal elites checking out South by Southwest,\u201d Ralat said. \u201cThey try some options, and then in their minds, they think it\u2019s an Austin thing. My job is to question the stuff \u2026 and let history speak for itself.\u201d  Ralat said San Antonio has \u201ca bit of an inferiority complex that they\u2019re often overlooked to the benefit of Austin when San Antonio is older, has more culture, it\u2019s more diverse, and the food is better.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, they\u2019re both Tex Mex towns, and breakfast tacos are Tex Mex. But they\u2019re also border food. When the Eater article came out\u201d \u2013 championing Austin as \u201chome\u201d of the breakfast taco \u2013 \u201cSan Antonians lost their minds.\u201d   Vega said the culinary history is too distant for any one place to stamp itself as originator or king purveyor. \u201cI don\u2019t know that one city \u2013 San Antonio, Corpus Christi, McAllen, Brownsville or Laredo \u2013 can claim it. You have differences with them because of ingredients.\u201d Movin\u2019 on Jessica Elizarraras, a Rio Grande Valley native and the executive producer for MySA.com, said many people have put the origins dispute behind them. \u201cI think at this point we\u2019ve mostly moved on from the great taco war of 2016,\u201d Elizarraras said in an email interview with CNN Travel. \u201cIs there occasional ribbing? Absolutely! Are there great tacos across the state? 1000 percent. The Mexican diaspora is far-reaching and so are their tacos.\u201d She cites a 2016 article by Gustavo Arellano as a detailed settlement of the issue that effectively shows Austin is not the start of the breakfast taco.  She also points out the regional differences within Texas. \u201cA flour tortilla in San Antonio tends to lean a bit puffier than its Rio Grande Valley/Coast counterparts. Con Huevos Tacos in San Antonio is the best of both worlds: a thin but sturdy tortilla, filled with fun, flavorful combinations.\u201d They\u2019ve gone nationwide   Ralat said he\u2019s now seeing breakfast tacos coast to coast. He was also recently in Nashville and saw them offered there.  \u201cI hesitate to eat them at a place that calls them Austin-style. \u2026 I want the food to be high quality. I don\u2019t want it to be spin.\u201d  Elizarraras suggests people just enjoy them \u2013 with or without huevos (eggs).  \u201cBreakfast tacos are ephemeral as they come, which makes them that much more magical,\u201d she said. \u201cBean and cheese is a great example of a breakfast taco that doesn\u2019t have eggs. \u2026 Chicharron en salsa (verde or rojo) is another example of a tasty taco that doesn\u2019t require eggs. Barbacoa \u2013 made using a whole cow-head, and more generally, beef cheeks \u2013 is a classic breakfast taco in San Antonio, often paired with Big Red [soda] for a Sunday morning treat.\u201d  The joy of it all In the end, why does the origin of a type of food even matter? \u201cPart of the issue is erasure. Just like with anything else in our Mexican-American culture, to feel left out of a conversation when you know you\u2019ve part of that conversation for a long time.\u201d Vega said. And back south of the Rio Grande, they are a source of unity, Esquivel said.  \u201cI think the breakfast tacos here in Monterrey \u2026 and the northeast of the country is something that unites everyone.\u201d  They\u2019re popular with the poor, the middle class and the rich, he said. \u201cThe place can be ugly. The place can be like in the streets. But you will see people in suits there eating breakfast tacos.\u201d  For Ralat, breakfast tacos are much more than a great way to start the morning. \u201cI think history, especially food history, is important to know because it provides another mirror for our culture. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to me that tortillas are the foundation of Mexican culture, and to break bread with someone is a sacred act. So let\u2019s take it literally, and say that you share tacos with someone else. That\u2019s so nice. And it\u2019s just so joyful.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/article/breakfast-tacos-origins-mexico-texas/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_article_james-beard-awards-2023-finalists", "text": "House-cured meat and handmade pasta, a three-course American menu where French techniques shine and a seasonally inspired eight-course tasting menu are among the offerings from the nominees for one of the culinary world\u2019s highest honors \u2014 the James Beard Awards. The James Beard Foundation announced the finalists for the 2023 Restaurant and Chef Awards on Wednesday in Nashville. The winners in the restaurant and chef categories will be revealed on June 5 during a ceremony at the Lyric Opera in Chicago.  For many in the US industry, the recognition comes on the heels of several challenging years. \u201cIt was a horrible last few years, and it was very difficult for restaurants and we all did the best we could. And I think we\u2019re all kind of shell-shocked and grateful to still be here,\u201d said Jennifer Uygur, who co-owns Outstanding Restaurant nominee Lucia in Dallas with her husband, chef David Uygur. Uygur said the category her restaurant was nominated in is especially meaningful in light of tough times during the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cI think the coolest thing about this one is that it\u2019s for Outstanding Restaurant, and it\u2019s the whole team \u2026 we can\u2019t do it without front of the house, back of the house, everybody, to make the whole experience.\u201d That sense of teamwork was echoed by the owners of Copine, a Seattle restaurant that turns out contemporary American cuisine using classical French techniques. \u201cYou just realize community and staff is really everything,\u201d said Jill Kinney, who runs Copine with her husband, chef Shaun McCrain. \u201cI mean you can\u2019t do it on your own.\u201d  Lucia and Copine are joined by three more finalists in the Outstanding Restaurant category: Coracora in West Hartford, Connecticut, Friday Saturday Sunday in Philadelphia and Mita\u2019s in Cincinnati. Recent changes to the awards Finalists were named across more than 20 categories, including the new Award for Outstanding Bakery. Two bakeries in Texas \u2014 La Casita Bakeshop in Richardson and Kuluntu Bakery in Dallas \u2014 are among the five finalists in that category. \u201cThe James Beard Awards celebrate outstanding achievement and exceptional culinary talent, as well as all those doing incredible work on behalf of our communities and wider food system. This year\u2019s nominees, winners and honorees are inspiring exemplars of that,\u201d said Clare Reichenbach, CEO of the James Beard Foundation.  Last year\u2019s awards marked the first bestowed under new policies and procedures and a new code of ethics sparked by allegations of chefs\u2019 bad behavior and a lack of diversity.  Many in the industry hope restaurant culture is changing, too. Chad Williams, chef at Outstanding Restaurant finalist Friday Saturday Sunday, said in an interview Wednesday that there is an opportunity for leaders to think about what they went through coming up the ranks, \u201cand making sure other people don\u2019t have to necessarily go through that.\u201d \u201cI came up in Michelin-star kitchens and \u2026 they were aggressive and much of what made them great was not the attitudes that were pushed there \u2026 there\u2019s other ways to do it,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAs we try to maintain our reputation and put out great food, there\u2019s also people behind that who you have to take care of.\u201d The awards in many key categories were abruptly called off in 2020 and remained on pause in 2021 amid the industry\u2019s pandemic upheaval and the foundation\u2019s work on the new framework. In 2023, the structure of the voting body has been tweaked, combining scouting and tasting duties for the judges. The nonprofit James Beard Foundation was established more than 30 years ago, shortly after \u201cpioneer foodie\u201d James Beard\u2019s death, \u201cto celebrate, support and elevate the people behind America\u2019s food culture.\u201d The first awards ceremony was held in 1991.  Beard was the host of \u201cI Love to Eat,\u201d the first food program on network television in 1946 and was called the \u201cDean of American Cookery\u201d by The New York Times in 1954.

{"id": "travel_anantara-santorini-abu-dhabi-uae", "text": "White, domed buildings cascading into crystal blue waters. To the eye, it\u2019s unmistakable. It\u2019s the world-famous holiday destination of Santorini, Greece. But, something feels different. Perhaps it\u2019s the hotter desert-climate breeze, or the Arabic calligraphy across the signage. A few hints here and there point towards the resort\u2019s actual location: Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. The Anantara Santorini Abu Dhabi Retreat opened in February this year and is an hour\u2019s drive away from the capital\u2019s downtown. The concept is entirely inspired by the renowned Greek island. Inside and out, it\u2019s a world of white, beige and blue, marked by arched corridors and doorways. Its bespoke artwork, ambient music and detailed embroidery on the linen all add up to a Mediterranean fantasy. Yet, beyond the intricate d\u00e9cor, for Rachid Bakas, the property\u2019s general manager, it\u2019s Abu Dhabi\u2019s natural beauty that truly draws the link between both locations. \u201cYou see the color of the sea next to us, and then the concept really comes together,\u201d says Bakas. \u201cThe idea of Santorini really fits within this location, and that\u2019s what makes this design immaculate.\u201d Not \u2018Chinatown\u2019 or \u2018Disneyland\u2019 Replicas are not usually marketed as a luxurious experience. But, Anantara Santorini could be an exception. Its lowest-priced room costs approximately $800 per night. That\u2019s double the average of Greece\u2019s Santorini hotels during high season, according to Tripadvisor. If the price isn\u2019t an advantage, why would a traveler prefer to visit the hotel in Abu Dhabi, and not fly to Greece? \u201cIt\u2019s exclusive,\u201d says Bakas. \u201cThis gives you that intimacy, this gives you that privacy. It\u2019s a hideaway \u2013 which you might not have actually in Santorini because especially in summer, everywhere is packed, everywhere is busy.\u201d Structurally, the hotel is divided into 22 rooms, accommodating a maximum of 44 guests at a time. All rooms lead to a living room-like common area, purposefully giving a very homey atmosphere, while encouraging visitors to walk through the facility\u2019s different environments. \u201cThe element of surprise is within the hotel itself and from the moment you walk, you keep discovering some nice corners and spaces,\u201d says Bakas. Anantara Santorini offers a range of experiences, including a cigar lounge, a cinema, a spa and yoga sessions by the pool or beach. Yet, more than entertainment, the hope is that guests can simply enjoy calmness and tranquility. \u201cSometimes, people just want to be left alone, they don\u2019t want to be asked to do activities all the time, and this is the balance that we offer,\u201d the manager explains. One more factor contributes to the facility\u2019s quietness: a restricted age group. The minimum age for check-in is 18, even if accompanied by parents or guardians. \u201cYou can really unwind, and feel away, and relax,\u201d Bakas says. \u201cIt was not an easy decision, but we really wanted to be on a different level [than other resorts in the region].\u201d Fifty shades of white While hoping to leave an impression on the guests, the hotel staff also work hard to remove certain marks. The white walls are kept impeccably white, and there\u2019s a team dedicated to just that. \u201cWe have two painters on site, and their daily job is to go around and do touch-ups,\u201d Bakas reveals. The painters go around the rooms in between check-outs and check-ins, making sure all the surroundings are not gray, beige or eggshell \u2013 just white. \u201cAfter the touch-ups, you need to make sure that the color looks the same, we want to make sure people don\u2019t see different strokes, so really, it\u2019s a crazy big part of our preventive maintenance,\u201d Bakas sighs, as he looks at the walls and ceilings, with a smile.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/anantara-santorini-abu-dhabi-uae/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "travel"}}
