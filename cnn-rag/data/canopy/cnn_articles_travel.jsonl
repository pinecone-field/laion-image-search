Singapore\u2019s state food agency has approved 16 species of edible insects for sale and consumption in the country, according to a July 8 public circular addressed to food traders. \u201cWith immediate effect, SFA will allow the import of insects and insect products belonging to species that have been assessed to be of low regulatory concern,\u201d the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) said in its release. Insects approved by the SFA include locusts, grasshoppers, mealworms and several species of beetle. \u201cThese insects and insect products can be used for human consumption or as animal feed for food-producing animals,\u201d SFA said, adding that insects could not be \u201charvested from the wild.\u201d \u201cDocumentary proof (is needed to show) that insects are farmed in premises regulated by the Competent Authority,\u201d SFA said. CNN has reached out to SFA for additional comment about the new regulations. A spokesperson said that insects not on listed would \u201cneed to undergo evaluation to ensure they can be used for human consumption.\u201d Like much of the world, eating insects in Singapore remains a novelty. Researchers have recorded more than 2,100 edible species of insects \u2013 many of which are packed with important vitamins and minerals and serve as a sustainable source of high protein in contrast to methane-producing livestock. \u201cInsects are an overlooked source of protein and a way to battle climate change,\u201d according to a 2022 report by the World Economic Forum. \u201cOur consumption of animal protein is the source of greenhouses gas and climate change. (Consuming) insects can offset climate change in many ways,\u201d researchers said. Grasshopper tacos are served as a popular delicacy in parts of Mexico. Ants, crickets and even tarantulas are commonly eaten in other Southeast Asian countries like Thailand and Cambodia. Live insects are commonly sold in Singapore as food for pets like songbirds and reptiles, but they could be a new and exciting option for human diners. Local chefs, restaurants and food and beverage companies have been experimenting with different ways to safely serve up insects in dishes like salted egg crabs with superworms and products like protein bars. \u201cAs the insect industry is nascent and insects are a new food item here, SFA has developed an insect regulatory framework which puts in place guidelines for insects to be approved as food,\u201d SFA said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/travel/singapore-approves-insects-consumption-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_travel_barcelona-tourism-protests-scli-intl", "text": "Protesters in Barcelona have sprayed visitors with water as part of a demonstration against mass tourism. Demonstrators marching through areas popular with tourists on Saturday chanted \u201ctourists go home\u201d and squirted them with water pistols, while others carried signs with slogans including \u201cBarcelona is not for sale.\u201d Thousands of protesters took to the streets of the city in the latest demonstration against mass tourism in Spain, which has seen similar actions in the Canary Islands and Mallorca recently, decrying the impact on living costs and quality of life for local people. The demonstration was organised by a group of more than 100 local organizations, led by the Assemblea de Barris pel Decreixement Turi\u0301stic (Neighborhood Assembly for Tourism Degrowth). According to official figures, almost 26 million visitors made an overnight stay in the Barcelona region in 2023, spending \u20ac12.75 billion ($13.8 billion). However, the Assemblea de Barris pel Decreixement Tur\u00edstic says that these visitors increase prices and put pressure on public services, while profits from the tourism industry are unfairly distributed and increase social inequality. It has published 13 proposals to reduce the number of visitors and transition the city to a new model of tourism, including the closure of cruise ship terminals, more regulation of tourist accommodation and an end to public spending on tourism promotion. On Saturday, the city\u2019s mayor, Jaume Collboni, highlighted a series of measures that he has announced recently to reduce the impact of mass tourism, including increasing the nightly tourist tax to \u20ac4 ($4.30) and limiting the number of cruise ship passengers. At the end of June, Collboni also announced that it would end apartment rentals for tourists by 2028 by scrapping short-term rental licenses for more than 10,000 apartments. This would help to make housing more affordable for long-term residents, according to Collboni, who said rents had increased 68% in the past 10 years, with the cost of buying a house up 38%. However, Collboni has been criticized for allowing events such as a Louis Vuitton catwalk show in architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed\u2019s Parc G\u00fcell in May, as well as the upcoming America\u2019s Cup sailing competition. The growing discontent in Barcelona echoes similar protests in other parts of Spain. In April, locals in the\u00a0Canary Islands\u00a0mobilized to protest against\u00a0excessive tourism, blaming visitors for pricing them out of their homes and causing environmental damage. These complaints are common to many tourist hot spots around the world, which have experienced record visitor numbers recently as the travel industry has roared back from a pandemic-induced downturn. Such surges may be sweet for local economies and hospitality businesses\u2019 bottom line, but they also come with notable downsides: increased noise, pollution, traffic and strain on resources; a lower quality of life for locals; and a diminished visitor experience, among others. Not surprisingly, many tourist magnets have created initiatives and restrictions intended to combat overtourism, including new or increased tourist taxes, campaigns aimed at discouraging problematic visitors and attendance caps at popular attractions.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/travel/barcelona-tourism-protests-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_vacation-fling-love-story-chance-encounters", "text": "Guillermo Barrantes relationship with Larry Mock was supposed to begin and end in Palm Springs. It was a \u201ccasual, brief encounter.\u201d A vacation dalliance that only lasted half a day. \u201cIt was just so casual, so easily nothing could have happened from it,\u201d Guillermo tells CNN Travel. \u201cWe could have walked away and just had our lives separate. But of course that didn\u2019t happen, because it wasn\u2019t meant to be that way. It was meant to be the way that it was. That it is.\u201d It all started in summer 2013. Guillermo - then in his early 40s - was on vacation in the California resort city of Palm Springs. He was in a phase of life where, he says, he was prioritizing himself, and wasn\u2019t interested in long term romance. \u201cI thrived in being by myself, in traveling by myself, in having dinner by myself \u2013 I loved all of that so much,\u201d says Guillermo, who lived in Boston, Massachusetts at the time. \u201cI wanted no commitment, I wanted no emotional entanglement of any kind. I wanted to have fun, get to know myself. And it was in that mode that I met Larry, when I wasn\u2019t really looking.\u201d During the vacation in Palm Springs, Guillermo was staying at a friend\u2019s apartment, and while the friend worked during the day, Guillermo passed his time at a \u201crun-down, no-frills\u201d resort a couple of blocks away. \u201cYou could just pay for a day pass, they\u2019d give you a towel, and you could be in the pool and use their bar,\u201d he recalls. One day, as he was walking the palm tree-lined streets to the resort, Guillermo swiped right on a guy on a dating app \u2013 Larry Mock, mid-40s, friendly smile. The two men exchanged a few messages back and forth. Larry said he was also on vacation in Palm Springs, staying in the resort Guillermo kept frequenting. They arranged to meet there for a drink by the pool. Guillermo was looking forward to meeting Larry, expecting \u201csome casual fun.\u201d Then, when Guillermo and Larry met, there was \u201cchemistry\u201d right away. Guillermo calls their connection \u201cmagnetic.\u201d \u201cMy impression of Larry: sexy, handsome and warm,\u201d he recalls. Larry was a Texas-based American Airlines flight attendant who\u2019d booked the vacation to Palm Springs at the last minute. He\u2019d recently broken up with a long-term partner but due to lease and budget reasons the two were still living together \u2013 awkwardly \u2013 in Dallas, Texas. Larry\u2019s workdays were spent traveling the world. But during his downtime, he struggled to relax in the apartment with his ex, and this sentiment motivated the spontaneous vacation. \u201cI needed to get out of town for the weekend, because we were just butting heads badly at that time,\u201d Larry tells CNN Travel today. Larry searched his airline\u2019s database, looking at destinations he could visit using the last minute, standby flight tickets available for flight attendants. \u201cPalm Springs had seats, so I booked my standby flight, got to Palm Springs, checked into this resort. And that\u2019s where Guillermo came into the picture,\u201d says Larry. Larry was instantly attracted to Guillermo. He thought he was \u201cjust the most handsome guy\u201d he\u2019d ever seen. And as they got chatting, and Guillermo kept making Larry laugh, Larry sketched out his first impression to include two more adjectives: \u201cso funny, and so kind.\u201d In passing, as the two flirted over pool-side cocktails, Larry mentioned that he was a flight attendant. Guillermo lit up. In fact, his response was \u201cgiddy,\u201d as Larry recalls it. \u201cHe started asking me tons of questions about planes, and flight attendants, and the routes and all of that kind of stuff.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a huge aviation geek,\u201d explains Guillermo. As a kid growing up in Costa Rica, he\u2019d wanted to be a pilot. Instead, he ended up working as an IT consultant. And while he says he was good at that job, liked it well enough and made good money \u2013 he still dreamed about working in aviation. Meeting a flight attendant was fascinating. \u201cI was immediately drawn to his career,\u201d says Guillermo. Larry found Guillermo\u2019s enthusiasm for aviation charming, and happily answered his questions. Later that evening, Larry and Guillermo said their goodbyes, with no plans to meet again. \u201cI was glad to meet him,\u201d says Larry. \u201cBut I was like, \u2018There\u2019s no way I am going to pursue dating somebody that lived in Boston.\u2019 And I still was dealing with what I was dealing with in Dallas.\u201d \u201cWe just really enjoyed the time that we had together,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cBut we went our separate ways.\u201d Unexpected moments Almost without realizing \u2013 and certainly without intending to \u2013 Guillermo and Larry stayed in touch. \u201cWe kept chatting, we kept texting,\u201d says Guillermo. Then, a few days after meeting Larry, Guillermo got an unexpected phone call from his mother in Costa Rica. He was still in Palm Springs at the time. \u201cShe said, \u2018I don\u2019t want you to freak out, but I just got diagnosed with breast cancer. I don\u2019t want you to change the trip.\u2019\u201d Guillermo tried to protest, but his mother insisted he should enjoy the rest of his vacation. She reassured him that her sisters and Guillermo\u2019s father were taking care of her, and she\u2019d see Guillermo later in the month \u2013 he already had a trip to Costa Rica scheduled for that summer. Not wanting to go against his mother\u2019s wishes, Guillermo stayed put in the desert. He tried to \u201ccompartmentalize\u201d the news, but he was really close to his mom, and it was cataclysmic. Later, back home in Boston, Guillermo found himself sharing his mother\u2019s news with Larry, and confiding in him about his fears and worries. He added that his mother lived in Costa Rica, so he\u2019d likely be flying back and forth for the rest of the year. Larry was supportive, empathetic \u2013 and he told Guillermo that he should use the discounted flights Larry got through work. Guillermo was taken aback \u2013 it was \u201csuch a sweet gesture\u201d from someone who was basically a stranger. But then, somehow, Larry already felt much more than that. \u201cVery early on, he and I had just beautiful interactions, and it revealed the kind of person that he was,\u201d he says. And so, rather than dwindling, Larry and Guillermo\u2019s communication increased as the days rolled on. \u201cWithin just a few weeks, we just knew \u2013 without much discussion, without talking about it \u2013 we just knew that there was a very, very strong connection there,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cWe always had something to talk about,\u201d says Larry. Larry was still hesitant about jumping into something new, following the breakdown of his previous relationship. But the messages back and forth with Guillermo became a highlight of his day. And as time passed, he found himself opening up to Guillermo, confiding in him. \u201cAfter a few months, I was like, \u2018Yes, this is exactly what I was looking for my whole life. Someone that I can be my authentic self with,\u2019\u201d says Larry. Long-distance dating In September 2013, two months after their Palm Springs meeting, Larry arranged to visit Guillermo in Boston. At Logan Airport, Larry came down the escalator and spotted Guillermo\u2019s face in the crowd. He was beaming, and started running towards Larry. Then, Guillermo \u201chugged me so hard,\u201d recalls Larry. He remembers thinking, \u201cOh my god, this is the one.\u201d Then Guillermo and Larry went to Boston\u2019s seaport district together, and found a sundrenched rooftop bar where they sat drinking beers. \u201cWe could see the planes approaching Logan, and it was just a sunny and perfect Boston day,\u201d recalls Guillermo. \u201cI remember that, like a picture, sitting by the edge \u2013 I remember the beer and I remember the planes.\u201d It was \u201cmagical,\u201d says Guillermo, but also slightly \u201csurreal.\u201d The Palm Springs encounter was so brief. He never thought he\u2019d see Larry again. And now here Larry was, sitting opposite him, in Guillermo\u2019s city. From there, Guillermo and Larry started dating cross-country. They took advantage of Larry\u2019s discounted flights. Sometimes Larry traveled to Boston, but usually Guillermo visited Larry in Dallas. Guillermo\u2019s love of flying meant that, for him, the four-hour journey across the country was part of the fun. \u201cI was in heaven,\u201d he says. \u201cJust the fact that I was getting to do something that I have always just loved - which is being on an airplane and going somewhere.\u201d Each Friday, as he packed his bag and headed to the airport, Guillermo would also be struck with \u201cexcitement\u201d at the thought of seeing Larry. And during these weekend visits, Guillermo and Larry grew accustomed to each other\u2019s habits, how they moved through their days, how they liked to spend their time. Guillermo got to know Larry\u2019s friends and got to know Dallas as a city. They spoke about their hopes, dreams, ambitions and families. Guillermo says it was obvious that they were \u201cvery aligned on the important aspects of life: how we view finances, closeness with families, politically and world views and enjoyment of the small things in life.\u201d Larry supported Guillermo as he cared for his mother through her cancer, and celebrated with him when she recovered. \u201cFor us, it was a gradual process of falling in love,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cBut a theme for us in our life together is that everything felt right and natural.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t pinpoint the moment, but we simply knew very deep in our hearts that we found the life partner.\u201d \u201cThat made me so happy,\u201d says Larry. For Guillermo, moving to Dallas two years later, in late 2015, was \u201cjust as the easiest decision.\u201d Larry was thrilled. His Dallas-based friendship group had already welcomed Guillermo into the fold, and his parents were happy for him too. \u201cI introduced Guillermo to everybody,\u201d says Larry. \u201cMy family\u2019s always been very accepting of me.\u201d Guillermo\u2019s family situation was more complicated. He\u2019s always been very close with his parents and siblings, but for the first two decades of his adult life, he didn\u2019t talk to his family about relationships. \u201cMy personal life was not necessarily an open book,\u201d Guillermo says. \u201cLove has never been the question - my parents love me, I love my parents and my sisters, we all get along great. But there was always that invisible barrier, which was: I don\u2019t talk about my personal relationships.\u201d But Guillermo didn\u2019t want to hide Larry from anyone - he felt he owed that to himself, and to Larry. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to edit myself, I wasn\u2019t going to filter. I just knew deep in my heart that it was my chance to be able to truly be myself,\u201d he says. So Guillermo started peppering his phone calls home with mentions of Larry. He uploaded cute photos of the two of them to social media. \u201cI\u2019m fearless,\u201d he told himself. \u201cNothing bad can happen here.\u201d A monumental year Cut to 2018, which was a monumental year for Guillermo and Larry for a couple of reasons. For one, it was the year Guillermo followed in Larry\u2019s footsteps and became a flight attendant. It was a mutual friend who suggested Guillermo should give it a shot, and Larry \u2013 who\u2019d spent years listening to Guillermo wax lyrical about airplanes \u2013 was wholeheartedly encouraging. Guillermo applied to Larry\u2019s airline, American Airlines, but wasn\u2019t accepted. But then he applied to Delta, and was accepted on the spot. While Guillermo and Larry loved the idea of working together, flying with different airlines also \u201cworked out great,\u201d says Guillermo. For one, there were two different sets of airline benefits to enjoy. And working in the air was everything Guillermo hoped it would be and more. \u201cI was doing my dream job, my childhood dream job,\u201d he says. \u201cI still have to pinch myself that actually, I am a flight attendant.\u201d 2018 was also the year Guillermo and Larry got married. Guillermo proposed to Larry on an airplane. The couple were flying back to Dallas after visiting San Francisco, where they\u2019d attended an Adele concert. As they were descending, the Dallas lights glistening out the airplane window, Guillermo suddenly felt the time was right. He turned to Larry and asked him to marry him. Larry smiled, and said yes. \u201cDespite it being impromptu, as an aviation geek, I love that I proposed on a flight,\u201d says Guillermo. The couple started planning their nuptials. Guillermo was excited, but he was unsure what role \u2013 if any \u2013 his family would play on the wedding day. While Guillermo had mentioned Larry to his parents, they still hadn\u2019t met him. This was partly because Guillermo\u2019s family were in Costa Rica, and partly because Guillermo wasn\u2019t sure how that meeting would play out. \u201cThe person that I had the most trouble with was my father \u2013 because he was the one that had the hardest time really accepting me,\u201d says Guillermo. As plans for the wedding started to take shape, Guillermo composed a long email to his father. \u201cI said something to the effect of, \u2018Hey Dad, I know I really haven\u2019t really talked much about any of my personal life. But I met this person, Larry, who is the love of my life. We are going to get married. Come, don\u2019t come, no problem. But I just need to tell you because this is probably one of the most important days and times of my life.\u2019\u201d Guillermo\u2019s father didn\u2019t attend the wedding. \u201cFor those reasons and also because he was towards the end of his life, his mobility was a problem,\u201d Guillermo says. \u201cBut my mom, my sisters, my niece and my nephew came, which was far more than I ever imagined or dreamed. That was such a great moment.\u201d Guillermo introduced his mother and sisters to Larry a couple of days before the wedding. They all gathered at a rooftop bar in Dallas, along with Guillermo and Larry\u2019s close friends. When Guillermo\u2019s mother saw Larry for the first time, she enveloped Larry in her arms. The two hit it off right away. Guillermo was overwhelmed with happiness. \u201cFor me, to see Larry and mom interact \u2013 they just love each other so much,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cAnd my sisters just cannot get enough of him \u2013 I just sit back, and just enjoy.\u201d A magical wedding day Guillermo and Larry\u2019s wedding took place at the Dallas Arboretum, a botanical garden. It was an outdoor wedding, and the couple woke up to the rain pouring and concerned texts from guests worried how the wedding would play out in a downpour. \u201cBut then, sure enough, out came the sun at the right time,\u201d recalls Guillermo. Larry and Guillermo wrote their own vows and read them to each other during the ceremony. Guillermo told Larry that he inspired him to be a better son, sibling, friend and person. \u201cYou want a partner that is going to challenge you to be better,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cI always feel that I want to be a better human being just in general, because he is such a figure in my life and everyone\u2019s life \u2013 he is the center of everybody\u2019s life.\u201d In turn, Larry promised Guillermo their married life would be \u201cexciting, adventurous and full of passion.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m proud to take you as my husband. I promise to fly with you to the ends of the earth,\u201d Larry said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to grow old together and look back at this beautiful moment.\u201d He ended the vows telling Guillermo: \u201cTe amo\u201d \u2013 Spanish for \u201cI love you.\u201d The reception was held at a local winery. During the celebrations, Guillermo and Larry danced to Rihanna\u2019s hit \u201cWe Found Love,\u201d which includes the lyric: \u201cWe found love in a hopeless place.\u201d The couple felt it was fitting \u2013 the resort they met at did seem a bit of a \u201chopeless place.\u201d And they never expected that brief meeting would lead to a lasting love. \u201cWe made sure that song was played, because we did find love in a hopeless place,\u201d says Larry. \u201cAnd I love Rihanna, too,\u201d says Guillermo. At one point, Guillermo and Larry walked through the reception doors holding hands, spontaneously lifting their arms in the air, a \u201cvictorious\u201d pose, as Guillermo put it. \u201cIt was just an electric effect,\u201d he says. The last piece of the puzzle A few years into their marriage, Guillermo and Larry visited Costa Rica together for the first time. Larry was excited to see Guillermo\u2019s home country, and Guillermo was excited to show his husband where he grew up \u2013 and the visit was also an opportunity for Larry to finally meet Guillermo\u2019s father. Guillermo was nervous about how the meeting would play out, but when he arrived at his parents\u2019 house with Larry in tow, Guillermo\u2019s father opened his arms and hugged Larry tightly. \u201cHe said, \u2018Welcome home,\u2019\u201d says Guillermo. It was a cathartic, emotional moment for everyone. \u201cI was so nervous that day, meeting the father-in-law,\u201d says Larry. \u201cAnd when he just said \u2018welcome home,\u2019 and hugged me, every bit of nerves went away. I felt comfortable, I felt welcomed, I felt loved.\u201d Larry says the moment felt like the \u201clast piece\u201d of a puzzle slotting into place. Guillermo was overjoyed. \u201cThat evening, which we got to spend \u2013 me, mom, dad, and Larry \u2013 was just a highlight,\u201d says Guillermo. The family played old records on a turntable. Guillermo and his mother danced in the living room, while Larry and Guillermo\u2019s father sipped cocktails and watched, laughing. \u201cI had to just step back, because you have to look at those moments and just kind of create a little mini movie of them,\u201d says Guillermo. Guillermo\u2019s father has since passed away, which makes Guillermo and Larry all the more grateful for that time together in Costa Rica. In general, a feeling of gratitude defines Guillermo and Larry\u2019s relationship \u2013 gratitude for each other and what they\u2019ve brought to one another\u2019s lives, and gratitude that their paths crossed over ten years ago. On their anniversary, the couple usually return to Palm Springs to celebrate the day they met. \u201cNot only is Palm Springs beautiful with a great vibe, but we love to go back and celebrate our meeting place,\u201d says Larry. \u201cWe weren\u2019t looking, neither one of us \u2013 but it did happen, and it\u2019s definitely for life.\u201d \u201cWhat a gift,\u201d says Guillermo, who says his life today is what he dreamed of \u201cas a little gay boy in Costa Rica, always loving the US, always loving airplanes, always envisioning that I would have a relationship where we are completely free to show our love.\u201d \u201cAnd we do, we do,\u201d he says. \u201cWho could ask for anything more?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/vacation-fling-love-story-chance-encounters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_ramesh-shukla-dubai-uae-royal-photographer-hnk-spc-intl", "text": "\u201cI am not famous \u2014 my camera is very famous. This camera.\u201d Ramesh Shukla pulls out a Rolleicord camera, a birthday gift from his father 70 years ago. It\u2019s the same camera he left India with in 1965; the same one that has snapped photos of sheikhs and political leaders; the same one that captured the formation of a nation. Now 85, Shukla has told and retold his life story so many times that the details are hard to pin down, mythologized into a series of essential moments that tell the tale of a plucky adventurer setting sail in search of fortune and opportunity. As he tells it, the then-26-year-old photographer boarded a ship from Bombay (now Mumbai), to the Trucial States \u2014 now the United Arab Emirates (UAE), but at that time, a collection of independent Sheikhdoms along the eastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula. He arrived at the port in Sharjah with just a dollar in his pocket and a few rolls of film, and hitched a ride on a donkey cart, then a motorbike, to Dubai:\u00a0not the glittering metropolis it is today, but a dusty fishing village with no roads, surrounded by huge, open expanses of desert. \u201cIn my house there was no water, no electricity. It was very difficult,\u201d says Shukla. It didn\u2019t stop him from getting out and documenting the fisherfolk, pearl divers and camel drivers living in the small coastal settlement. But change was on the horizon. The Trucial States, while not a colony, were part of a \u201cBritish protectorate\u201d that was soon to end, and oil had only been discovered in the Arabian Gulf a few years earlier, with the first exports beginning to create wealth for the small Emirati population. And at that time, there were very few people in the region with the skill, technical knowledge and equipment to produce the quality of photography that Shukla could. His big break came when he attended a camel race in Sharjah in 1968. The sheikhs from the various emirates were in attendance that day, and Shukla snapped a photo of the group sitting along the side of the track. Among them was Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the late emir of Abu Dhabi, who is often referred to as the \u201cfounding father\u201d of the UAE. The next day, he returned to the racetrack and presented the photo to Sheikh Zayed, asking for his blessing \u2014\u00a0and it changed everything. \u201cWhen he saw the picture, Sheikh Zayed tells me, \u2018You are Fannan\u2019 (meaning \u201cartist\u201d in Arabic),\u201d says Shukla. Capturing history After the camel race, Shukla found himself invited to official events as a photographer, accessing places and people he could only have dreamed of a few years earlier. He developed a friendship with the royals, and Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, ruler of Dubai until his death in 1990, encouraged him to stay in the Emirates \u2014\u00a0so in 1970, his wife and son joined him in Dubai. \u201cWhere I grew up, we had one room which was our living room, our kitchen and the dark room,\u201d explains Neel Shukla, Ramesh\u2019s son. \u201cWe had thalis, for the Indian way of eating food \u2014 it\u2019s a steel plate and you put your different vegetables and dal and roti on it. That same thali was used for eating and developing film.\u201d Neel recalls that resources were scarce \u2014\u00a0especially water, which was delivered by donkeys from wells in the desert. The water used to develop photos had to be precisely measured out, and Shukla\u2019s wife, Taru, played a vital role in her husband\u2019s work: while he was photographing events, she recorded technical notes that would impact how the pictures were developed later, such as the lighting, exposure and shutter speed. \u201cWithout my family, my wife and son, I couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d Ramesh Shukla says. On December 2, 1971, Shukla was called to join a moment of huge historic significance for the region: the signing of the unification agreement that saw six of the emirates \u2014 Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Umm Al-Qaywayn, Fujairah and Ajman \u2014 come together as the United Arab Emirates. (Ras Al-Khaimah joined as the seventh emirate just two months later.) Shukla\u2019s photo of Sheikh Zayed signing the unification declaration is instantly recognizable for those in the country \u2014 even 50 years on, thanks to its use on the new 50 dirham note, printed in 2021 to celebrate the nation\u2019s 50th anniversary. A \u2018world-famous\u2019 camera Shukla continued to document Dubai and the Emirates through the 1970s, \u201880s and \u201890s, although he still has \u201chundreds\u201d of undeveloped rolls of film from this period. He\u2019s still developing them, releasing unseen images of the sheikhs in exhibitions every few years. In a bid to continue his legacy, Shukla \u2014\u00a0with the help of his son, Neel \u2014 has set up a darkroom lab to teach the next generation of Emirati photographers the technical skills of analog photography. The year-long \u201cmasterclass\u201d course, which will start in September this year for 10 students, is free through Dubai Culture, a government organization. Shukla hopes it will give young photographers a chance to gain skills that are being lost since the advent of digital photography. \u201cThey\u2019ll graduate under my father\u2019s mentorship, and they will have that standing from (being taught by) the Founding Fathers\u2019 photographer,\u201d says Neel Shukla. Over the years, Shukla\u2019s photography has been compiled into books and showcased in exhibitions as a vital witness to the formation of the country. While it\u2019s his name across the books and posters, he insists it was the Rolleicord that did all the work. \u201cI told my father, \u2018Papa, I will make this camera one day world-famous,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cThis is my dream.\u201d With millions of copies of his books distributed in the past few years alone, it\u2019s safe to say he achieved it.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/ramesh-shukla-dubai-uae-royal-photographer-hnk-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_canada-dream-supersonic-bomber-avro-arrow", "text": "It was meant to be one of the most advanced aircraft of its era, dispatching the threat of Soviet nuclear bombers and making Canada a world leader in military aviation and engineering. The Avro Arrow, also known as the CF-105, had a lot resting on its wings. However, the dream turned into a nightmare when the program was canceled less than a year after the plane\u2019s first flight, and well before it entered into service. To this day, 65 years later, the Avro Arrow remains one of Canada\u2019s biggest collective regrets and still fuels public discourse, as recently unveiled documents have shed some light on exactly what happened to the doomed project. \u201cThis aircraft was completely Canadian,\u201d says Richard Mayne, chief historian of the Royal Canadian Air Force, \u201cand the performance markers during its development very much showed that it was at least on par with the most advanced designs of the time.\u201d \u201cWhen it got canceled, that was one of Canada\u2019s \u2019what if\u2019 moments,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe Arrow has still got a grip on our national psyche.\u201d Cold War threat The Avro Arrow was a direct response to the perceived threat from the Soviet Union, following the end of World War II, of bombers capable of flying over the Arctic and reaching North America with a nuclear payload. \u201cThe Royal Canadian Air Force put out a requirement in 1952 for an interceptor capable of Mach 2 speed and an altitude of 50,000 feet,\u201d Mayne tells CNN. \u201cThey needed something fast that had the range and the altitude to intercept these Soviet bombers as far north as possible, before they reached Canada.\u201d Aircraft manufacturer Avro Canada had just successfully put into service the CF-100 Canuck, a versatile twinjet fighter designed and built in Canada, and was tasked with developing a vastly more advanced version of it. It was an ambitious plan that came at a significant moment for Canada. \u201cThe country had emerged from the Second World War as a major player,\u201d says Mayne. \u201cWe had the third largest navy in the world, the fourth largest air force. But Canadian citizenship didn\u2019t actually exist until 1947 \u2013 Canada had just come of age.\u201d Development started in 1955, and in record time the first Arrow was rolled out to the public, on October 4, 1957 \u2013 the same day as the launch of the Sputnik I, the world\u2019s first artificial satellite, which marked the start of the space age. \u201cIt was a coincidence,\u201d says Mayne, \u201cbut a horrible one, because Sputnik demonstrated that you could put a nuclear payload on the rocket that sent it into orbit. And the Arrow wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything about intercontinental ballistic missiles.\u201d Dead on arrival Designed for a crew of two and sporting a \u201cdelta\u201d wing design and a white livery that gave it an elegant look, the Arrow was just under 78 feet long with a wingspan of 50 feet, making it comparatively larger than both its predecessor, the CF-100 Canuck, and the Phantom F4, a dominant American fighter plane that would enter service in 1961. It first flew on March 25, 1958, but by that time, Mayne says, strategic thinkers, senior military personnel and politicians already believed the world had entered a \u201cpush button\u201d warfare scenario, where the nuclear threat was restricted to long-range missiles, with interceptors and bombers no longer playing a dominant role. \u201cThat turned out to be false, because the bomber threat continued and it continues to this day, but that was the thinking at the time,\u201d says Mayne. The plane had lost relevance, and the ballooning costs of the project and the changing political climate did the rest. On February 29, 1959, Prime Minister John Diefenbaker canceled the program, and within weeks the five planes that had been built, along with most of the assembly line, were destroyed for fear that they could be the subject of Soviet espionage. As a result, thousands of jobs were lost and Avro Canada eventually collapsed entirely. \u201cIf the United Kingdom had bought some Arrows, that actually might have saved the program,\u201d says Mayne. \u201cBut with no foreign contracts, our country was too small to support such an advanced technology. We were shooting for the stars, which is ironic because a lot of Avro engineers later went down to NASA and helped with the Apollo program.\u201d A life of its own Rumors and myths immediately began to swirl around the reasons for the abrupt cancellation of the program, some of which persist to this day. \u201cThe aircraft has taken on almost a mythological standing in Canada,\u201d says Alan Barnes, a senior fellow at Ottawa\u2019s Carleton University who has looked at the role played by intelligence in the decision to stop the plane\u2019s development. One set of myths, according to Barnes, essentially blames the United States for misleading Canada on the shifting Soviet threat, supposedly because they didn\u2019t want Canada to produce an aircraft that would have been better than American ones. Another says Canadian intelligence analysts deliberately misconstrued information to support a decision that the government had essentially made, providing an excuse for it. \u201cBut all of this was speculation, as nobody had actually seen the intelligence reports,\u201d he says. But in 2023, Barnes published a paper on those reports, after retrieving archival documents that show a clear link between the intelligence and how it was used by those in charge at the time. \u201cAt the beginning, the air force really didn\u2019t pay any attention to intelligence,\u201d he tells CNN. \u201cThey decided they wanted a big new fancy plane, so they came up with all the operational requirements largely in isolation, without really paying attention to what the reports were saying.\u201d By the late 1950s, he adds, the Arrow arrow was getting very expensive and quite delayed. \u201cCanadian intelligence produced a very high quality assessment in early 1958, saying the bomber threat was nowhere near as serious as previously thought, and that the Soviets weren\u2019t building up a massive bomber force, and were likely to shift their production and research into missiles,\u201d says Barnes. The policy implication was that if a threat was being reduced, there was very little reason to be spending so much money on an aircraft that wouldn\u2019t be able to deal with the ballistic missiles. \u201cBy the summer of 1958, the Chiefs of Staff Committee had come to the conclusion that they could no longer recommend continuing with the program, but didn\u2019t want to cancel it right then because of the political impact,\u201d says Barnes. \u201cThey sort of delayed things into early 1959, when it was still seen publicly as a disaster for Canadian industry as well as a political scandal. The government did what they needed to do, but it blew up in their face. They lost the election a couple of years later, to a certain extent on these defense issues.\u201d According to Barnes, the aircraft was never as good as people made it out to be. \u201cIt was canceled at just the right time to maintain this kind of mythology,\u201d he says. \u201cIt never flew with any of its armaments and the actual engines that it was designed to use. Everything was potential, so many Canadians can still pretend that this would have been the best aircraft in the world.\u201d Enduring impact In 1997, the CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) commissioned a TV miniseries about the plane titled \u201cThe Arrow\u201d starring Dan Aykroyd as Crawford Gordon, president of Avro Canada. A full-size wooden model of the aircraft was built for the production and is currently in the archives of the Reynolds Museum in Wetaskiwin, Alberta. Another model, made of aircraft-grade aluminum, is on display at the Edenvale Aerodrome in Stayner, Ontario. A third model, about two-thirds the size of a real Arrow, is under construction at Springbank Airport in Calgary \u2013 but this one is meant to actually fly. It\u2019s the passion project of a group of engineers who are hoping to take it to the skies by 2026. Although none of the actual Arrows have survived intact, the original cockpit and nose gear of one of them as well as parts of the wings of another are on display at the Canada Aviation and Space Museum in Ottawa. Perhaps the strongest indication of Canada\u2019s obsession with the Arrow came in 2018, when after a year of searching, sunken Arrow models were recovered from the bottom of Lake Ontario. The models were fired across the lake as part of flight tests in the mid-1950s, and numerous groups had been looking for them before without success. The endeavor was funded out of pocket by John Burzynski, a Canadian mining businessman. \u201cThe significance of finding the models lies in reminding Canadians of the great effort that went into designing, testing, building and flying an advanced technological aircraft, all done in a short six-year timeframe,\u201d Burzynski says, adding that among the pieces discovered was one of the very first test models, substantially intact, which is now on display at the Canadian Aviation and Space Museum in Ottawa. Speaking of the importance and role of the Arrow in Canadian history, Burzynski says that everything was possible to the generation that followed World War II, and the world was changing quickly. \u201cThe massive effort that went into the Arrow program was essentially a live exercise, showing that anything is possible when enough effort and ingenuity is applied to a problem,\u201d he says. \u201cTo many it seems that this would have been an inflection point for Canada to develop both a vigorous air and possibly even space program, had it not been abruptly canceled.\u201d CORRECTION: An earlier headline on this story mischaracterized the Avro Arrow. It was an interceptor aircraft.

{"id": "travel_man-buys-cheap-house-italy-life-expectancy", "text": "Most people buying cheap houses in Italy are simply attracted by the idea of paying a bargain price for the opportunity to escape to somewhere warmer that has better food. But what if it could also help you live longer? That was the thinking for Bingwa Thomas, 72, originally from Kansas City, who purchased an old dwelling in Latronico, deep in Italy\u2019s southern Basilicata region, hoping that the change in lifestyle would push him well beyond the life expectancy of his demographic in the United States. Of course, price was also a factor. Thomas, currently based in Los Angeles, decided to purchase a 110 square-meter home primarily down to its affordability after he negotiated its down to 8,000 euros (about $8,662.) Bargain home scheme Involved in social activism since the age of 18, Thomas was also taken with the Italian town\u2019s proximity to Africa, where he says he is involved in humanitarian aid projects. \u201cMy main reason for establishing a residence in southern Italy was to have better access to the African continent,\u201d he says. \u201cTo be able to use my pension to create, fund, network and volunteer with programs on the African continent.\u201d \u201cI wanted a residence that I would not have to spend a lot to make habitable, so that I could have more money for the African projects.\u201d Thomas, who self-funds his activism work through acting gigs, including commercials, industrial films and voice-over assignments, was also attracted by the region\u2019s healthier, slower-paced lifestyle, hoping that it would help to increase his life expectancy. \u201cLife expectancy in Italy is 82.7 years, while in the US it\u2019s 79,\u201d he says. In fact, the World Health Organization puts that US age figure closer to\u00a077. \u201cBut for a Black male it\u2019s 70. So in the US I\u2019m already two years past my expiration date. But in Italy I can get 10 extra years.\u201d Thomas\u2019 motivation for moving to Italy seems to be part of a shift away from the original reasons that people were buying into the country\u2019s cheap homes selloff, which began a few years ago as depopulated and dying towns sought to attract new people to breathe new life into their communities. At first, the majority of buyers, according to the mayors promoting the schemes, were foreign families and retired couples hoping to buy a vacation retreat. This appears to have changed over time with artists, philanthropists and social activists now looking to make the move. Latronico is one of the towns that\u2019s been luring mainly American buyers with cheap houses and rentals. CNN Travel first wrote about Latronico\u2019s house sales in 2021, and the destination has attracted much attention since. Among properties put up for sale are turnkey homes priced as low as 10,000 euros (around $10,800) and crumbling properties in need of a thorough renovation. According to Thomas, his purchase process was seamless, and the only challenges were mostly due to pandemic-tied travel restrictions. He was thrilled that former deputy mayor Vincenzo Castellano, the man behind the housing scheme, picked up the phone when he called to enquire, and supported him throughout the entire purchase, and said that this played a part in his decision making. Thomas, who has been traveling to Italy every few months since purchasing the home, has budgeted about 20,000 euros (around $21,656) for the renovation work \u2013 along with furnishings and appliances. He says he hopes to help develop Latronico\u2019s community by creating an arts center on the ground floor of his house in the future. \u201cArtists have always taken over abandoned buildings in an undesirable area of a city and brought the buildings and neighborhoods back to life only to have the newly revitalized buildings taken away or had their rents increased by greedy landlords,\u201d he says. \u201cWith these small neat little European villages, artists don\u2019t have to rent, they can actually own their living spaces and studios. \u201cThe villages get repopulated and the artists don\u2019t get ripped off of their creative energy.\u201d New buzz Latronico\u2019s old district has been in decline since the 1850s, when families started abandoning the area in search of a brighter future elsewhere, leaving behind dozens of empty homes and silent alleys. Today, thanks to the cheap homes selloff, there\u2019s a new buzz in the area as Latronico\u2019s 4,000 or so residents adapt to living alongside newcomers mainly from America, but all over the world. For Thomas, life in Latronico fits in with his artistic philosophy. \u201cAs an artist, I love the challenge of taking forgotten, under-appreciated or discarded items and repurposing them,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I love most about Latronico is the dedication and attention to detail in the attempt to first, stop the bleeding, resuscitate and bring back to life this beautiful town.\u201d Artists have often played a role in revitalizing communities through their creativity and Thomas hopes to be another example of this by contributing to\u00a0local village life through cultural and artistic projects once his arts center is up and running. He says he admires Latronico\u2019s revival efforts, explaining that he\u2019s tried to do the same in various communities in the US for the past 50 years, with far more resources than those available to local authorities in Latronico. Thomas has experience living outside the US, having spent time traveling around the world and working \u201codd jobs\u201d throughout Europe. \u201cMy usual route during this period was summer working on the Greek island of Ios, then up to either Ireland or the UK to harvest and sell Christmas trees or work in a pub,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the spring, I would always end up in Amsterdam, where you were legally allowed to work in the youth hostels in exchange for a bed, two meals, laundry and internet usage for two months.\u201d Thomas says he\u2019d often go over to Berlin\u2019s multicultural Kreuzberg district to work on the preparation of the yearly Carnival of Cultures, which celebrates cultural diversity in the city. Then he\u2019d hitchhike back down to the Greek isles to start the cycle all over again. Slower pace of life Latronico\u2019s pace of life may seem sedate when compared to Thomas\u2019 former lifestyle, but he says that\u2019s what he likes about it. \u201cLiving in Italy gives me more of the one thing that is important to me and should be the number one thing of importance to any living being \u2013 literally life,\u201d he says. Thomas exercises daily, going on long runs up Latronico\u2019s panoramic wild hills and says he has been reveling in his new environment, even before he\u2019s fully settled in. The home Thomas purchased in 2022 is spread over two levels, each measuring 55 square-meters wide, with the top floor already habitable. He is completing most of the renovation work himself, using local businesses to help with things like plumbing, while his friends in Italy are handling the electrics. He plans to install a bathroom on the ground floor and restore the old fireplace and wood-burning oven. \u201cUpstairs, it will basically stay the same, it has functioned well as a living space for me the past couple of years,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only changes will be to relocate the bathroom to the back of the unit and make minor improvements to plumbing, ventilation and electrical.\u201d The ground floor, which had previously been used as an animal shelter, will be leveled out, with electrical outlets added, along with a toilet, sink and shower. Thomas says he hopes to help contribute to the development of Latronico\u2019s community by using the property to create new services and encourage other artists to move to the town. He says he doesn\u2019t plan to live in the house and has offered to donate it to a nonprofit, bicycle co-op in Los Angeles, with the stipulation that they use it to provide the same services offered in the US, such as free instructions on how to repair and maintain bikes. He\u2019s in the process of buying a second property for 39,000 euros (about $45,727) \u2013 a six-bedroom \u201ccompound\u201d of three different rural cottages in Varrazzo, a hamlet about five miles outside of Latronico, with a patch of land, which is where he\u2019ll reside. Thomas hopes to transform the second \u201cmove-in-ready\u201d home into a multi-purpose arts complex, with accommodations for visiting international youth and adult artists. He says the cheap house prices in Latronico have allowed him to turn his back on a lifetime of having to rent. \u201cI have always had to choose between buying property or investing in projects for the community,\u201d he adds. \u201cIn Latronico, I can do both.\u201d While he says he loves Latronico, Thomas has discovered that life in a remote rural village in southern Italy isn\u2019t always as idyllic as it seems. He says the main cons are linked to the town\u2019s isolated position, as well as the infrastructure and transport systems in the south, which are decidedly lacking when compared to Italy\u2019s north. Thomas is still trying to \u201cadjust to not having access to just about anything I want or need 18 to 24 hours a day.\u201d He\u2019s in the process of moving out of his Los Angeles apartment and hopes to officially move to Latronico in September. He says his visitor visa will allow him to spend six months of the year in Italy. Once he\u2019s established in Latronico in September, Thomas says he plans to use the town as a semi-permanent residence, as well as a base for traveling to and from Africa, where he plans to volunteer on projects in remote villages in Cameroon and Senegal. \u201c[It] will be a lot easier going back and forth from Africa to southern Italy than Africa to Los Angeles.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/man-buys-cheap-house-italy-life-expectancy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "travel"}}

The duo said they went through check-in without any issues and were escorted to the boarding gate as usual. On board, crew members briefed them about in-flight safety procedures but later removed them from the plane over safety concerns after learning they were traveling unaccompanied, according to Li and Chui. \u201cWe felt insulted and embarrassed. They were treating us as if we were criminals,\u201d Chui said in a press conference on Sunday. Blind Union president Billy Wong, who is authorized to speak on behalf of the two men, said the handling of the situation left the passengers confounded because they had been able to travel alone without issues on other airlines. Wong also called on the airline to investigate its protocols and treatment of travelers with disabilities, saying guidelines from aviation authorities were toothless. \u201cThey need to ensure that companies comply with these guidelines and that there are punitive measures when companies discriminate against people with disabilities,\u201d Wong told CNN. HK Express said in a statement that \u201cdue to differing judgments made by the ground staff and aircrew,\u201d the case was escalated to management for assessment and the \u201cadditional time required\u201d to decide had led to the pair being \u201cunable to travel on the original flight.\u201d The Hong Kong-based carrier is a wholly owned subsidiary of Cathay Pacific\u00a0, which was recently crowned the world\u2019s fifth-best airline. HK Express said its staff had followed the airline\u2019s \u201cstandard safety procedures,\u201d during the incident, without specifying whether the two passengers had failed to comply with its protocols. The airline added it was later confirmed that \u201cthe two passengers could travel safely without a companion,\u201d and they were \u201cre-accommodated on a later flight of their choice on the same day to their destination.\u201d \u201cThe decision made by the aircrew was entirely based on safety considerations, and the on-duty staff accompanied the two passengers as they left the cabin,\u201d HK Express commercial director KK Ong said in a separate statement. \u201cWe sincerely apologize for the delay and inconvenience caused to the two passengers.\u201d Travelers with disabilities already face physical hurdles when navigating large, busy airports and catered, needs-based assistance is not always a guarantee. In 2013, Albert Rizzi, a blind man from Long Island, and his dog, Doxy, were escorted off a US Airways flight after a heated exchange between him and a flight attendant. All 35 passengers on the flight walked off in solidarity with Rizzi. Last year, Air Canada apologized and pledged to expedite accessibility improvements for passengers with disabilities after a man who uses a wheelchair made international headlines when he shared his experience of\u00a0dragging himself off a flight. Rodney Hodgins said he had to drag himself along the aisle, helped by his wife, when airport mobility assistance staff didn\u2019t turn up to aid him when his flight landed in Las Vegas. Air Canada staff told him to disembark on foot \u2013 despite the fact that he can\u2019t walk \u2013 so they could turn the plane around, he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/travel/hong-kong-express-blind-passengers-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "travel"}}

None of them are nearly as long as her most recent video, \u201cThe Spectacular Failure of the Star Wars Hotel.\u201d Over the course of 20 video chapters, Nicholson details her 2022 stay at the \u201cStar Wars: Galactic Starcruiser\u201d hotel in Orlando, Florida. The tale is likely familiar to Disney and Star Wars fans, many of whom heard about the high-dollar, high-concept hotel and its closure in 2023. Nicholson says she paid more than $6,000 for a two-night stay in the hotel, which was supposed to resemble a Star Wars-style spaceship called the Halcyon. The big draw of the hotel lay in what Disney marketing called an \u201cimmersive, customizable Star Wars experience\u201d that Nicholson equated to LARPing, or live-action roleplaying. Guests were encouraged to dress up, and through a combination of live experiences with cast members and choices made in a special app, were guided through a three-day-long Star Wars storyline complete with full itinerary and, if played to its full extent, very little downtime. With Disney-esque details like working lightsabers and colorful themed food, the experience was supposed to feel like a \u201clandlocked cruise,\u201d with all of the entertainment happening onboard the ship \u2014 in reality, a large ultra-secure windowless building near Walt Disney World\u2019s Epcot resort area. Nicholson\u2019s experience squared with some more critical reviews of the hotel: Cramped rooms, inconsistent experiences with technology and a general sense of confusion as to the purpose or audience of the venture. (She also mentioned, at length, some of the things she enjoyed, like cast member performances and details in the ship-hotel\u2019s interior.) Little of this is new information. Disney announced the closing of the Galactic Starcruiser in May 2023, and the hotel served its last guests last September. In a press release provided to CNN from that time, Disney said the project \u201cgave us the opportunity to try new things.\u201d \u201cStar Wars: Galactic Starcruiser is one of our most creative projects ever and has been praised by our guests and recognized for setting a new bar for innovation and immersive entertainment,\u201d the statement read. \u201c\u2026 we will take what we\u2019ve learned to create future experiences that can reach more of our guests and fans.\u201d Still, Nicholson\u2019s video netted more than 2 million views in two days, and has already wormed its way into the social media pipeline of memes and references. Some X users marveled at the fact that they willingly watched a double feature-length video about, as one user said, something they \u201cpreviously never gave a s*** about in my life.\u201d Why yesterday\u2019s drama draws today\u2019s audience Longform videos are an increasingly popular form of YouTube entertainment, and it isn\u2019t unusual to see older topics being reexamined in multi-hour \u201cdeep dives.\u201d Nicholson\u2019s video also combines several winning formulas into one: Disney, Star Wars, insider information (Nicholson includes pictures and videos from her time in the hotel) and, of course, failures. \u201cI couldn\u2019t care less about some dumb Star Wars hotel, but give me those 4 hours,\u201d one X user said. Consumer research from Google claims that longform videos are gaining traction among younger viewers and, interestingly, are even more successful when they cover \u201cfan culture\u201d content. \u201cThere is a healthy appetite for more in-depth exploration of topics such as film, TV, and sports,\u201d a 2022 Google consumer insights report reads. \u201cThese allow for fan-centric creators to share thoughts and ideas at length with an increasingly captive audience: 61% of Gen Z would describe themselves as a \u201creally big\u201d or \u201csuper fan\u201d of someone or something.\u201d Both Star Wars and Disney enjoy particularly loyal fandoms with elephant memories and no qualms about engaging the same topics over and over again. Even the tiniest details in a Star Wars movie or a Disney theme park have cult followings, backstories, fan lore and, of course, their own video deep dives. A spotlight on Disney\u2019s future Nicholson\u2019s video, while not exactly breaking news, drops as Disney prepares a new slate of innovations. Earlier this year, Disney announced a massive 10-year, $60 billion expansion program for its parks, cruises and experiences worldwide. That includes a planned 14-acre expansion at the Magic Kingdom in Orlando\u2019s Walt Disney World and an expansion of the original Disneyland in Anaheim. The company recently got final approval from Anaheim\u2019s city council to move forward with DisneylandForward, a nearly $2 billion investment in the Disneyland resort and surrounding areas. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to build on decades of innovation, creativity, and storytelling to bring new, exciting experiences for our guests,\u201d Disneyland Resort President Ken Potrock wrote in a blog post announcing the approval of the project. In April, Disney CEO Bob Iger said expansion plans for Walt Disney World are on track after the settlement of a long legal battle between Disney and the state of Florida. Iger said the decision \u201cwill actually enable us to pursue the kind of significant investment in our Florida parks.\u201d Disney enthusiasts are expecting a trove of new information this August, when the company hosts its annual D23 Expo that focuses on upcoming projects and attractions. While the Galactic Starcruiser hotel has now earned a place in the annals of Disney lore, renewed interest in its failure provides a new lens through which to see Disney Parks\u2019 ambitions and expansions. Will they live up to everyone\u2019s wildest dreams, or be the subject of the next four-hour YouTube deep dive?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/travel/star-wars-hotel-disney-jenny-nicholson-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_article_eva-longoria-searching-for-mexico-restaurants", "text": "You\u2019ll no doubt be hungry after watching \u201cEva Longoria: Searching for Mexico.\u201d Every episode is full of mouthwatering regional specialties prepared by chefs all over the country. For those wanting to follow in Eva Longoria\u2019s footsteps, below is a guide to the restaurants and locations she visited. Veracruz: Cradle of Mexican gastronomy Longoria visits the coastal state of Veracuz. Its position along some 400 miles (645 kilometers) of the Caribbean Sea made it a focal point for military conflict \u2013 and the collision of food cultures. \u201cThe people of Veracruz took this treasure trove of ingredients passing in and out of the port and created a whole new cuisine,\u201d Longoria said. \u2022 Longoria met chef Erik Guerrero, who aims to make fishing more sustainable in Veracruz, at Namik restaurant, where they enjoyed ceviche with hot beans and soft shell crab taco. \u2022 Next up, she joined actor and friend Ana de la Reguera for some coffee at historic Caf\u00e9 La Parroquia, Veracruz Port. Tap on the glass three times to ring for milk. \u2022 She headed to the lush inland mountains to meet coffee farming expert Itzel Mendoza at Cafetal Privado en Coetzala to learn how the precious bean is grown. There, they gathered flowers in the fields to be added to chicken stew, a salsa and a palm flower fritter. \u2022 Back in Veracruz Port, she met food historian Nidia Hern\u00e1ndez Medel at Chuchumb\u00e9, a cultural center, to cook some fried yucca, which is traced back to the city\u2019s African slave era.  \u2022 It\u2019s back out of the city to meet with vanilla farmer Norma Gaya, of Gaya Vanilla and Spices, for some vanilla chicken. \u2022 At El Tajin ruins, a Totonac settlement, Longoria met cook Do\u00f1a Marta. She\u2019s the founder of Smoke Women, which keeps ancient Totonac traditions alive. They enjoyed alcamaya (fresh-water shrimp) stew and mushroom empanadas. \u2022  Chef Luis Palmeros, a rising star on the Mexican food scene, introduces Longoria to traditional cook Do\u00f1a Rocio at Cuarto Blanco Market in the inland city of Xalapa (the capital of Veracruz state), for a traditional stuffed jalape\u00f1o. He then takes Longoria to his restaurant, El Cuarto Blanco, for his modern take on the dish. Jalisco: Birthplace of traditions \u2022 At Tortas Ahogadas El Pr\u00edncipe Heredero in Guadalajara, Longoria samples a torta ahogada \u2013 the region\u2019s beloved \u201cdrowned\u201d sandwich. \u2022 In Guadalajara\u2019s Santa Teresita neighborhood, Longoria samples a new preparation of native ingredient chinchayote at Xokol, a restaurant run by chefs \u00d3scar Segundo and Xrysw Ruelas D\u00edaz. \u2022 Longoria attends a charreada, a Mexican rodeo, that takes place at Lienzo Charro Charros De Jalisco. Afterward, she sampled birria, the celebrated goat stew from Jalisco, at the clubhouse. \u2022 Chef Fabian Delgado Padilla treats Longoria to mole with pork belly at his restaurant palReal in Guadlajara\u2019s Colonia Americana neighborhood. \u2022 At Lake Chapala, about 30 miles south of Guadalajara, Longoria meets with members of one of the oldest indigenous groups in Mexico, the Coca people, to talk about their fight to preserve their way of life and history on the lake. They feast on local fish called charales. \u2022 Longoria meets friends Mariana Padilla and Alejandra Pelayo at traditional cantina La Iberia in Guadalajara. Women weren\u2019t allowed in cantinas until the 1980s, Longoria said. \u2022 Then she heads to to the town of Tequila, where Salvador Rosales Trejo shows her how tequila is produced by Tequila Cascahuin using traditional methods. \u2022 Longoria and chef Fabian Delgado Padilla visit Yunaites, his casual restaurant inside a municipal market in Guadalajara, for gorditas topped with pork and mole. Nuevo Le\u00f3n: Where beef is king Say adios to vegetables for a while. Nuevo Le\u00f3n is the land of meat. In this state in northeast Mexico, carne asada is a go-to meal. And it\u2019s the cuisine Longoria grew up with in Texas.  \u2022 In Monterrey, Longoria met up with Alejandro Guti\u00e9rrez, founder of the Mexican Society of Grill Masters, to try the region\u2019s specialty: carne asada (grilled meat). In August, there\u2019s a grill master competition in Santiago, outside of Monterrey. \u2022 Tacos Do\u00f1a Mary La Gritona has been serving breakfast tacos in Monterrey for nearly 20 years. \u201cThese are the best tortillas I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d said Longoria. \u2022 El Jonuco restaurant celebrates the products of Nuevo Le\u00f3n with a focus on seasonal ingredients. They\u2019re known for their cabrito (roasted goat). The restaurant celebrates the little-known history of crypto-Judaism in the region, Longoria said. \u2022 Dona Lupita\u2019s Caf\u00e9, located in the backyard of her home right next to Highway 85 south of Monterrey, is famed for its legendary tamales. \u2022 La Divinita bakery is one of the most successful bakery chains in Monterrey. The founder uses local oranges to make a traditional dessert with Longoria. \u2022 Koli restaurant, run by the three Rivera Rio brothers, is a fine dining restaurant that aims to tell the story of Nuevo Le\u00f3n. Oaxaca: A gastronomic capital Nestled within three vast mountain ranges, Oaxaca is a magnet for food lovers in the know.  A thrill of any visit here is sampling the moles, as well as dishes such as tlayudas (thin Oaxacan \u201cpizzas\u201d), spicy hot chocolate and asado grilled in smoky market stalls. \u201cIt is on another level gastronomically, one of the best places I\u2019ve been to in the world,\u201d Longoria said. \u2022 Mercado de Abastos is a giant market on the edge of Oaxaca City. If you want your chocolate fix, the mercado is still the place to come. This region is known for its moles \u2013 complex sauces featuring many blended ingredients.  \u2022 Casa Oaxaca makes Oaxaca\u2019s famous mole negro drizzled over turkey breast. Longoria called it a magnificently complex and sophisticated sauce. \u2022 At Las Quince Letras, chef Celia Flori\u00e1n made Longoria quesillo \u2013 a stretched Oaxacan cheese --  with crickets and edible flowers. \u2022 In the area of Oaxaca located on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, several muxes, who identify as a third gender and are guardians of Zapotecan cuisine, cooked up stuffed pork with pineapple served alongside pureed potatoes. Longoria called it \u201cthe perfect combination.\u201d \u2022 The farming town of Santa Ana Zegache is the unassuming epicenter of corn. Corn has been worshipped for over 6,000 years and is still the beating heart of Mexican cuisine.  \u2022 In San Baltazar Chichicapam, Longoria visited a palenque (agave farm) run by Do\u00f1a Berta, one of very few female mezcaleras. The farm produces mezcal, the smoky liquor for which this region is famed. \u2022 La Cocina de Humo is a hip restaurant using local ingredients. Chef Thalia Barrios Garc\u00eda is known for her heirloom tomato salad with beet puree and herbal dressing. Longoria said it\u2019s the \u201cperfect dish.\u201d Here\u2019s the recipe.   Yucat\u00e1n: Defined by the Maya Mayan DNA runs through the recipes in Yucat\u00e1n, which has the largest Maya population in Mexico.  The state is located along the Gulf of Mexico and is surrounded by dense forests that isolate it off from the rest of the country. The Maya thrived here for thousands of years before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors in the 1500s. The region\u2019s geography and turbulent history have had a significant impact on the cuisine. \u2022 Ixi\u2019im mixes modern and ancestral techniques and flavors. The restaurant has its own version of the most famous dish from the Yucat\u00e1n, cochinita pibil. Chef Luis Ronz\u00f3n slow-cooks pork underground after it\u2019s marinated in sour orange and spices.  \u2022 Condimentos Enrique is a family-run business that sells recados (spice pastes) in Mercado de Santiago in M\u00e9rida. \u2022 At Huniik, which means \u201cunique spirit\u201d in Maya, chef Roberto Sol\u00eds makes onion tempura with black recado. \u201cI have never had anything like this. This is gorgeous, and it\u2019s delicious,\u201d said Longoria.  \u2022 In his home in Xoc\u00e9n, chef Alberto Kuku prepared one of the oldest dishes, Mayan chicken tamales, for Hanal Pix\u00e1n, a holiday celebrated by the Maya people that means \u201cfood for the souls.\u201d The food honoring the dead \u201ccan easily be carried back to the underworld,\u201d he said. \u2022 Chef Regina Escalante, who runs Merci in M\u00e9rida, showed Longoria how to make grilled seabass with mango, avocado and flor de sal. \u201cI\u2019d have this as my last meal on Earth,\u201d said Longoria. Here\u2019s the recipe. \u2022 At Uxmal, Mayan archaeologist Don Pepe cooked up smoked pork and bean stew. It cooks underground for 12 hours.  \u2022 Kinich in Izamal is famous for its queso relleno. A key ingredient is, surprisingly, Dutch cheese. See how it\u2019s made:  Mexico City: The city of tacos \u201cIt\u2019s crazy, it\u2019s crowded, it\u2019s noisy \u2013 and I love it!\u201d Longoria said as she walked the streets of Mexico City, where she lives part-time with her family. This region was once the capital of the mighty Aztec empire, known as Tenochtitl\u00e1n until the Spanish invaded about 500 years ago and changed its name to Mexico City. Here are the places Eva Longoria visited in the episode: \u2022 Tomasa is a Mexican bakery known for its conchas, a fluffy sweet bread with a crunchy topping.  \u2022 El Huequito in the Historic Center serves up delicious al pastor tacos, which are a staple in Mexico City. \u2022 Tacos Los Alexis is sizzling hot in the taco world. Owner Alexis Ayala uses his five-star culinary training to transform traditional recipes from his childhood into to-die-for gourmet tacos.  \u2022 Contramar in Roma, the bohemian part of town, is one of Longoria\u2019s favorite restaurants. Owner and chef Gabriela C\u00e1mara made her signature dish: pescado a la talla. \u2022 M\u00e1ximo Bistrot, a gourmet restaurant that marries French and Mexican cuisine, is run by chef Eduardo \u201cLalo\u201d Garc\u00eda. For Longoria, he made a roasted beet salad with rocket and wilted purslane. Best known as a weed, purslane is nonetheless edible and very nutritious. \u2022 Mercado de Jamaica is one of hundreds of markets in the city. At the street food stalls, Longoria tried green chorizo tacos and tlacoyos, thick oval-shaped tortillas typically stuffed with beans or cheese. \u2022 Casa Tochan refugee shelter is the first shelter for immigrants in Mexico City. The residents cook dishes from their homeland to share with their housemates.  \u2022 El Moro is an institution famous for its churros and chocolate. \u2022 Hiyoko restaurant in Little Tokyo cooks up a Mexican-Japanese fusion. Chef and restaurateur Edo L\u00f3pez whipped up tapioca tostadas, chicken skewers with ants and duck donburi.

{"id": "travel_north-korea-summer-camp-intl-hnk", "text": "Even for locals, travel inside the isolated nation officially known as the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea is heavily restricted. But arranging a trip was much easier for Russian national Yuri Frolov, 25, who spent two weeks in the hermit kingdom as a high-school student in 2015 and 2016.\u00a0Yuri\u2019s fascination with North Korea began with a TV documentary that portrayed the country as besieged by capitalist neighbors. This curiosity led him to join a \u201cSolidarity with North Korea\u201d group on VKontakte, Russia\u2019s Facebook equivalent. Through this group, he found an opportunity to attend Songdowon International Children\u2019s Camp in Wonsan, on North Korea\u2019s east coast. About $500 covered all expenses for a 15-day trip. His parents consented, and he traveled alone from St. Petersburg to Vladivostok, joining other children and Communist Party officials on the journey. Earlier this year, 100 Russian nationals were the first tour group allowed to visit North Korea since the pandemic, a sign of Russia\u2019s increasing popularity as Pyongyang deepens ties with Moscow. Before the pandemic, the largest source of inbound tourists to North Korea wasn\u2019t Russia \u2013 it was China. Upon his arrival at Songdowon International Children\u2019s Camp in summer 2015, the camp staff greeted Frolov and his group warmly. The camp hosted children from various countries, including Laos, Nigeria, Tanzania and China. However, interactions with North Korean kids were limited to the final day, a deliberate move to prevent any exchange of real experiences. The camp offered typical summer activities like beach outings and sandcastle-building competitions but also included peculiar rituals. Campers were required to wake at 6 a.m. and clean statues of former North Korean leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, even though professionals already maintained the monuments. Having reported from North Korea 19 times, I find Frolov\u2019s experiences both relatable and eye-opening. The heavy emphasis on propaganda, the strict supervision, and the bizarre mix of freedom and control are aspects I\u2019ve encountered repeatedly. One of the more bizarre activities at the summer camp involved a computer game where players, as a hamster in a tank, had to destroy the White House. This game reminded me of an exchange I had with two North Korean campers playing a similar game. When I asked who they were shooting, they responded, \u201cOur sworn enemy, Americans.\u201d I then asked, \u201cWhat if I told you I\u2019m an American? Do you want to shoot me too?\u201d Without hesitation, they replied, \u201cYes.\u201d After reassuring the youngsters I was a \u201cgood American,\u201d they decided I should be allowed to live. And then they smiled and waved as we said goodbye. This is the paradox of North Korea. People were usually friendly and polite, even as they told me the United States should \u201cdrown in a sea of fire.\u201d Despite the heavy propaganda, Frolov remained skeptical. The strict schedule frustrated him, especially when he wasn\u2019t allowed to skip early-morning exercise despite being sick. The camp\u2019s food was another challenge, with Frolov saying he mostly subsisted on rice, potato wedges and bread, leading to an 11-pound weight loss over the 15 days. His craving for familiar food was so intense that upon returning home, he bought a feast from Burger King, though he couldn\u2019t finish it all. Frolov recounted a memorable incident in Pyongyang: \u201cThere was a girl, very young, wearing a dress styled like the American flag in the city center. Surprisingly, no one was angry with her, even though she was told not to wear it again. It was a bizarre moment in such a controlled environment.\u201d \u201cMany things seemed fake, especially the science and innovation buildings. They were not convincing, even for a kid,\u201d he reflected. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a totally awful experience. I was mostly just bored. Apart from the lack of internet, it felt like any basic Russian camp for children.\u201d Despite the unpleasant and tightly controlled environment, he opted to return to the camp the following year, partly due to the Communist Party\u2019s arrangements and what he describes as his aversion to confrontation. In hindsight, Frolov acknowledges the decision as foolish but appreciates the unique stories he can share about North Korea. His account offers a rare glimpse into the experiences of foreign children at a North Korean summer camp, highlighting the country\u2019s efforts to indoctrinate young minds through a mix of cultural exchange and propaganda. Yuri Frolov\u2019s story is a powerful reminder of the lengths to which North Korea will go to shape perceptions and cultivate loyalty. His experiences at Songdowon International Children\u2019s Camp highlight the regime\u2019s use of propaganda and control to influence young minds, a strategy I\u2019ve observed firsthand during my reporting trips. Despite the stark differences in our roles \u2013 him as a camper and me as a journalist \u2013 our experiences reveal the same underlying truth about North Korea\u2019s relentless pursuit of ideological control.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/north-korea-summer-camp-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_tiktok-tap-water-europe-trend", "text": "American Helene Sula vividly remembers the first time she discovered tap water was a different ball game in Europe. Sula, from Texas, was at a restaurant in Germany. When the server asked for her drink order, Sula requested water. \u201cThey kind of scoffed at me like, \u2018You can get water. But why would you?\u2019\u201d Sula recalls. She remembers glancing around and realizing everyone else in the restaurant was enjoying glasses of wine and pints of beer \u2013 no water to be seen. Sula repeated her water order and the server demurred. But, when the water arrived, it wasn\u2019t the giant glass of free tap water, sloshing with ice, Sula was expecting. Instead, she was served a single glass liter bottle of sparkling water, accompanied by a tiny drinking glass and 2 Euro price tag. Sula couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cIn the US, you sit down at the table and you\u2019re given a huge glass of water with ice and it\u2019s not even a question \u2013 it\u2019s just plopped on the table. No matter if you\u2019re at a fancy restaurant or a casual restaurant, you\u2019re going to get a huge free glass of water,\u201d Sula tells CNN Travel. A few years later, when Sula and her husband relocated to Germany \u2013 the couple observed another water-related cultural difference. Whenever they went out hiking, biking or walking the city, Sula and her husband would pack large water bottles \u2013 sometimes even CamelBaks, a type of water backpack (\u201cSo we can drink water at every possible moment,\u201d Sula explains). Meanwhile their European friends often went without water entirely, holding out until they decamped to a bar that evening \u2013 and even then, they\u2019d usually opt for wine instead. Sula couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cI just figured, maybe Europeans just don\u2019t get as dehydrated as we do,\u201d says Sula, still audibly baffled after several years living in Europe. Understanding European water habits If you\u2019re thinking: \u201cWait, this is just one person\u2019s opinion and it\u2019s a pretty broad generalization,\u201d you\u2019d be right. After all, there are many different countries within Europe, each with their own culture, dietary habits, traditions and water-drinking habits. And of course the US isn\u2019t a cultural monolith either. Sure, some Americans take pride in their enormous Stanley cups and undertake water-related daily challenges, but others would always opt for soda if given the choice. And while many Americans are conscious of the environmental impact of plastic water bottles, others actively eschew water from the kitchen faucet and keep their fridge stocked with bottled water. Nevertheless, Sula isn\u2019t alone in her observations. US travelers sharing hot takes on European tap water consumption (or lack thereof) has become a bit of a social media trend over the past year or so. Take TikTok user br3nnak3ough, who in summer 2023 uploaded a video depicting her friends downing large bottles of water, overlaid with the text: \u201cUs the moment we can find water because Europeans don\u2019t believe in water.\u201d This video been viewed 10.9 million times and attracted 13,800 comments \u2013 both from Americans in agreement (\u201cI was so dehydrated when I went lol, the heat + lack of ac and water/ice had me dying..\u201d) and Europeans vehemently disagreeing (\u201cWhat are you talking about\u201d) Meanwhile, Rob Murgatroyd, an American living in Italy, recently uploaded a TikTok commenting that the difference between US and Italian water consumption had \u201cblown his mind\u201d since moving to Florence. \u201cWhere I come from, we\u2019re practically wired to drink water non-stop, as if it\u2019s our main gig, while here in Italy, spotting someone with a water bottle is like finding a needle in a haystack,\u201d Murgatroyd captioned the video. There are TikToks marveling at the size of European water glasses, Instagram Reels chronicling the often ill-fated quest to order a jug of tap water in a European bar and posts on X bemoaning paying for bottled water in restaurants. Sula, who chronicles her life abroad on the blog Helene in Between, has weighed in on the great European tap water debate a couple of times \u2013 including at the end of last year: \u201cTap water is not free at (European) restaurants,\u201d Sula asserted in a November 2023 TikTok video. \u201cAnd if you do get it, it comes in a miniscule glass.\u201d Plenty of commentators were dismissive: \u201cIt\u2019s free. They\u2019ve seen you coming from a mile off,\u201d read one response. Others echoed Sula\u2019s experience, adding that while tap water is usually available \u2013 bottled mineral water or bottled filtered water is more commonplace in many European countries. \u201cI think it\u2019s a really interesting conversation,\u201d says Sula. \u201cThe world can feel very small sometimes, because we\u2019re all online and it\u2019s such a global society now \u2026 so I think it\u2019s interesting to have these conversations, to talk about the differences.\u201d A water expert weighs in To get a sense of what\u2019s really going on beyond just the anecdotal evidence, CNN Travel called up Stavros A. Kavouras, a professor of nutrition at Arizona State University. Kavouras is director of the university\u2019s Hydration Science Lab, which focuses on the impact of hydration on health and performance. Kavouras is also a Greek expat who\u2019s lived in the US for 20 years, so he\u2019s pretty well placed to comment on transatlantic culture clashes. First off, Kavouras emphasizes the myriad of differences between the countries that comprise the European continent. He highlights, for example, the contrast between \u201cNorthern European foods versus French, Italian, Greek cuisine, and dietary preferences.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t like the generalizations,\u201d says Kavouras, who says while it\u2019s tempting to set up a Europe versus the US dichotomy, it doesn\u2019t usually stand up. Kavouras also points out that Americans who visit Europe (and post about it online) don\u2019t represent the majority of the US population. \u201cIt\u2019s not the average American,\u201d says Kavouras. \u201cThe skewed population that you see coming to Europe \u2013 they are people that are more educated, wealthier, higher socioeconomic status\u2026\u201d This is relevant, states Kavouras, because there\u2019s data to suggest Americans of lower socioeconomic status drink less water. But after laying down these parameters and qualifications, Kavouras agrees there are some potential differences between the US and Europe when it comes to \u201cwhat people drink, what people like, and how hydrated they are.\u201d \u201cFor instance, if you go to Germany and you ask for water, you get sparkling water. That\u2019s the default,\u201d Kavouras says. \u201cAnd so if you served tap water in Germany, to every human, people would be like, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t drink this water.\u2019 So why would you do it?\u201d Kavouras also notes that paying a few euros extra for a liter glass bottle of water at dinner is more accepted in Europe than the US. While Americans might be shocked, it\u2019s something many Europeans wouldn\u2019t think twice about, says Kavouras. He suggests Americans perturbed by the extra cost could look at it as \u201cthe equivalent of the American tip that you have to pay guaranteed 17 to 25% nowadays in the United States.\u201d (Tipping culture in Europe is quite different \u2013 and usually involves much smaller percentages) As for whether Europeans are generally more dehydrated than Americans, Kavouras says it\u2019s interesting that there\u2019s a difference between the dietary guidelines for water intake in the US and Europe. \u201cIn the United States, the guidelines are 2.7 liters for females, and 3.7 liters per day for men. And in Europe, the equivalent numbers are 2.0 and 2.5,\u201d he says. \u201cSo these are the guidelines \u2013 it doesn\u2019t mean this is what people drink \u2013 but this is what is recommended.\u201d And as for the American TikTokers joking about tap water served in tiny \u201cshot glasses\u201d in Europe, Kavouras suggests this could be part of a more general difference between the US and the rest of the world. \u201cI mean, you know the stereotype \u2013 the US does it bigger for everything \u2013 cars, houses, everything is bigger, servings in restaurants\u2026etc. I think it might be a little bit of that,\u201d says Kavouras \u2013 adding the same applies for the \u201cthe water carry containers that Americans carry around.\u201d Kavouras always finds it amusing when he spots his colleagues coming into work with \u201ca tiny barrel of water, like there\u2019s no water in the building.\u201d Giant water containers are \u201cunnecessary\u201d in Kavouras\u2019 opinion. That said, Kavouras advises everyone should find a way to ensure they\u2019re well-hydrated throughout the day \u2013 whether they\u2019re working in an American office or walking around a European city. \u201cWater is a critical component of every healthy diet. So being adequately hydrated, it\u2019s very important, especially in the summer,\u201d he says. Advice for Americans If you\u2019re an American traveler heading to Europe this summer and panicking about the water situation, Kavouras advice is to, first off, take all the viral social media posts with a pinch of salt. It\u2019s worth researching the specific destination you\u2019re heading to, and finding out what\u2019s the norm there \u2013 rather than assuming every country in Europe is the same. Familiarize yourself with the words used for sparkling, still and tap water in your destination\u2019s language, so you can make sure to order your preference. And if you want to skip bottled water at restaurants, Kavouras suggests staying hydrated by stocking up at a grocery store instead: \u201cBottled water is not as expensive if you plan a little bit and buy the water from the supermarket, versus buying it always in restaurants.\u201d And Kavouras\u2019 final piece of advice? Pack a reusable water bottle in your suitcase and carry it with you throughout your vacation \u2013 not only on your travel days. \u201cTap water in most European cities is potable, it\u2019s safe, and you can drink it,\u201d Kavouras says. Many European cities have fountains across the city where people can stop and hydrate. Hotels, cafes and restaurants will usually fill up your bottle for you if you ask. \u201cBring an empty water bottle \u2013 it really doesn\u2019t have to be a gallon,\u201d says Kavouras. \u201cJust bring a normal size water bottle so you can refill it whenever you have a chance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/tiktok-tap-water-europe-trend/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "travel"}}

{"id": "travel_article_chance-encounters-florence-italy-kacie-rose", "text": "Kacie Rose Burns walked into the Florence jazz bar, alone. \u201cI\u2019ll go for one song and suss it out,\u201d she thought, trying to quieten her nerves. Kacie slipped in at the back. The club was dark and busy, a few wall lights and neon signs illuminating people drinking, dancing and chatting. Before she could even take in the musicians on stage, Kacie\u2019s eyes landed on a tall man sitting at the bar. \u201cI walked in and he was there,\u201d Kacie tells CNN Travel today. \u201cWe clocked eyes.\u201d \u201cCiao,\u201d said the stranger, smiling. \u201cCiao,\u201d Kacie said back, before adding apologetically: \u201cThat\u2019s all the Italian I\u2019ve got for you.\u201d It was October 2018. Kacie was a 24-year-old New Yorker on vacation in Florence. It was her first time in Italy and her first time traveling solo. It was an exciting \u2013 and terrifying \u2013 experience. \u201cI was a professional dancer in New York,\u201d explains Kacie. \u201cA very exhausting career \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of toxicity, a lot of rejection, there\u2019s a lot of politics that come into play \u2013 and I was feeling a little stuck, a little unhappy, a little \u2013 just stagnant, if you will.\u201d Kacie spent her days auditioning, traveling for gigs and moonlighting at a clothing store. She needed a break, and she\u2019d long felt a \u201cpull\u201d to Italy and dreamed of an Italian vacation. \u201cI kept saying, \u2018I\u2019ll wait for somebody to go with, I\u2019ll wait, I\u2019ll wait. And then I was waiting for years. And so then one night \u2013 at two in the morning \u2013 I was like, \u2018What am I waiting for? Life is too short.\u2019 So I booked a solo trip to Italy.\u201d Kacie planned to spend the majority of her time in Rome and Venice and just a couple of days in Florence. But in the lead-up to the trip, she got chatting to a customer at the store she worked at. This woman had lived in Florence for five years and sung the Tuscan city\u2019s praises, persuading Kacie to add an extra day to her Florence stint. And that\u2019s how Kacie and the Italian stranger happened to be in the jazz club on the same evening. \u201cI\u2019m really glad that I listened to her,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cThat\u2019s the only reason why we met on the first night that I was in Florence, on that earlier day that I wasn\u2019t originally supposed to be there.\u201d A Florence meeting The man Kacie crossed paths with in the jazz bar was 26-year-old Dario Nencetti, a chef in a Florence hotel who usually worked nights. It just so happened that was the only evening he had off that week. The jazz bar, called Jazz Club Firenze, was one of Dario\u2019s favorite hangouts. He loved the music, the underground ambiance and the fact the bar encouraged punters to sign up for jam sessions. \u201cThat place is, let\u2019s say, unconventional for Florence,\u201d Dario tells CNN Travel. \u201cUsually in Florence, there\u2019s like a table for two or three or four people. In the jazz club, there are big tables, so you can sit with strangers and stuff, which I love.\u201d When Dario realized Kacie didn\u2019t know much Italian beyond \u201cciao,\u201d they switched to English. Dario told Kacie he\u2019d lived in Scotland for a year, and they got talking about travel. Kacie mentioned she was on her first solo trip and Dario said he\u2019d embarked on a similar adventure to Japan earlier that year. \u201cWe bonded from the beginning,\u201d says Dario. \u201cIt was really natural, really easy conversation.\u201d \u201cI remember he made me laugh,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Oh, this guy\u2019s interesting.\u201d So many people ask us, \u2018How did you know?\u2019 And I don\u2019t know how I knew. I was just like, \u2018Oh, this is something different.\u2019\u201d Kacie and Dario stayed at the jazz bar talking into the early hours of the morning. Then they spent as much time as possible together over the next two days. \u201cHe would meet me after his work \u2013 every night he got off at 11. And we would go out and we would just talk,\u201d recalls Kacie. \u201cI instantly fell in love with Florence. It\u2019s a very romantic city - cobblestone streets and medieval buildings. It looks like a painting everywhere you look.\u201d It was a whirlwind two days. One evening they sat by Florence\u2019s Ponte Vecchio bridge and talked until 3 or 4 a.m. It was as though Kacie was in a film \u2013 somewhere between every millennial\u2019s favorite \u201cThe Lizzie McGuire Movie\u201d and classic Florentine romance \u201cA Room with a View.\u201d Then, the two days were up and Kacie had to continue onto the next leg of her trip. It was still like something from a movie \u2013 only it wasn\u2019t obvious this one had a happy ending. \u201cI got on the train and he was standing on the platform. And I remember looking out the train, and I was so sad,\u201d she says. As the train pulled away from the station, Kacie wiped away tears and messaged her best friend back home in New York. \u201cI just met my future husband in Florence,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s the guy I\u2019m gonna marry. I\u2019m never gonna see him again.\u201d Her friend tried to cheer her up. \u201cYou\u2019re going to Rome,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYou\u2019ll meet a gladiator!\u201d But Kacie knew what she had with Dario wasn\u2019t replaceable. \u201cWe never stopped talking. We FaceTimed every single day,\u201d she says. This continued when Kacie was back in the US. And before long, Dario was planning a trip to visit New York. A New York minute On December 8, 2018 Dario arrived in the US. Kacie spent a week introducing Dario to her life in New York. \u201cIt was really cool to see it through his eyes,\u201d she says. \u201cShe showed me the real city,\u201d says Dario. Then the couple flew to Miami for a week\u2019s vacation. For Kacie and Dario, there was never a specific moment where they decided to embark on a relationship. \u201cIt was never a decision to be made,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cIt just went without saying,\u201d agrees Dario. \u201cBut I can\u2019t hide it, long distance was hard.\u201d The two struggled with time zones and their busy jobs that left them with little downtime, but tried to visit each other whenever they could. Cut to September 2019. Dario was back in New York visiting Kacie. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I move here?\u201d he suggested. He\u2019d loved the vibrancy of the city from the get-go and could see himself there. The restaurant scene was incredible. If he could find a job and organize the visa, it seemed like the ideal scenario. Kacie thought so too, so Dario started asking around. He was eventually hired as a chef at an Italian restaurant in Brooklyn. After a couple of months in limbo, his visa was approved. \u201cUp until that point, every time that we had to say goodbye it was borderline traumatic \u2013 we had spent this week together and we knew that this was it for each other,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cSaying goodbye in airports sucked. It would take like a week to recover.\u201d But now the airport goodbyes were consigned to the past. \u201cIt was really exciting,\u201d says Dario. Moving forward together Kacie and Dario spent three months in New York together, giddy with happiness to be in the same country and the same city. Then the pandemic hit. New York City\u2019s performing arts and restaurant industries ground to a halt. Stuck at home, Kacie and Dario found solace and support in one another. As Kacie puts it, she and Dario found \u201cmany silver linings\u201d in this tough time. Dario taught Kacie how to make pasta. They cat-sat. They spent long evenings chatting. But as 2020 rolled on, the couple were aware there was a deadline hanging over them. Dario\u2019s visa was set to run out in December and in the wake of the pandemic, renewal was out of the question. For Kacie and Dario, it seemed like there were only three viable choices: return to long distance, get married or move to Italy. Going back to long distance would mean the return of those airport goodbyes, the last thing either of them wanted. And while Kacie and Dario thought marriage was in their future, they didn\u2019t feel it was right for them at that point. That left moving to Italy. Kacie thought about her career in New York. Performing was off the table and there was no return date in sight. And while her friends were regularly posting on social media about how much they missed dancing, Kacie only felt \u201crelief\u201d that her days were no longer defined by auditioning and uncertainty. \u201cThat was a pretty big wake-up call,\u201d she says. \u201cI had gotten to a point where I needed to take a little step back from performing.\u201d On top of this, Kacie\u2019s New York apartment lease was up. If there was ever a time to relocate to Italy, it was now. \u201cEverything kind of fell into place,\u201d she says. Kacie researched online and found a language academy in Florence offering study visas. She applied, enrolling in Italian lessons. Then, Kacie and Dario packed up their life in New York and got ready to move across the Atlantic. Before stepping on the plane in January 2021, Kacie posted a video to TikTok about meeting Dario and the move to Italy. She\u2019d never posted much on the platform before, but felt inspired to mark this significant life step. When she stepped off the plane and connected to Wi-Fi, her cell phone was blowing up. \u201cIt went viral,\u201d says Kacie. While stuck inside during mandatory two-week quarantine, Kacie continued posting TikTok videos. Her following continued to grow. While her social media presence was getting bigger, for the first few months in Florence, Kacie and Dario\u2019s IRL world remained small. Italy was still in the thrall of Covid, with strict restrictions. But as Kacie studied for her Italian lessons and taught English online and Dario looked for restaurant work, Florence started to slowly reopen. \u201cI remember the first time going to the Duomo. And there was nobody there,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cWhich is crazy, because it\u2019s like the main focus point of Florence. And there\u2019s nobody in the piazza and I remember how bizarre that was.\u201d While that moment was surreal \u2013 even sad \u2013 Kacie and Dario still felt grateful to be at the Florentine landmark together. They\u2019d come a long way, and they were excited for their new life together in Italy. Acclimatizing to Italian life was made easier for Kacie by Dario\u2019s family, who welcomed her wholeheartedly \u2013 even if, in the early days, Kacie struggled with Italian and Dario\u2019s mother didn\u2019t know much English. The two women made communication work by using Google Translate on their cell phones. \u201cThey bonded immediately,\u201d says Dario. Kacie continued to post on social media, and her following ballooned. After about six months, she stopped teaching English online and decided to do social media full time. Dario encouraged this step. \u201cI think it was a really good idea diving into it,\u201d he says today. \u201cIt was the right moment, the right time, and I believed in her from the first moment.\u201d A life together in Italy Almost four years later, Kacie\u2019s expanded her social media presence into a travel company, running group tours around Italy and publishing her own travel guides. Meanwhile, Dario is still passionate about cooking and now works as a fine dining chef at a Florence restaurant. \u201cI really love the life we\u2019ve created here,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cWe live in a beautiful place with great food and he\u2019s got so many awesome things going for him and same with me.\u201d The couple encourage each other in their respective careers and endeavors, but they also savor their downtime. They love living in Florence and exploring Italy together. Dario and Kacie are settled in Florence for now, although they don\u2019t rule out a move elsewhere in the future. \u201cWe\u2019re enjoying the moment,\u201d says Dario. \u201cThe solid thing is the fact that we know we\u2019re in it together. And that\u2019s what makes it so great,\u201d says Kacie. She tells Dario: \u201cI\u2019m not nervous for what the future holds. Because I\u2019ve got you.\u201d Looking back, Kacie finds it serendipitous and surreal to think her spontaneous decision to travel solo in Italy led her to find a new career, a new home and the love of her life. \u201cThere were so many things that had to happen for it to actually happen, but it just felt normal and natural \u2013 like of course this is right and this was supposed to happen,\u201d she says. \u201cYou never really know what life has planned for you. There\u2019s so many good things waiting. You just have to trust it,\u201d adds Kacie. \u201cTrust in the process. And the path that is meant for you will happen, even if it\u2019s not the path that you intended to take for yourself.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/article/chance-encounters-florence-italy-kacie-rose/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_the-end-of-off-season-travel-cmb", "text": "It might be an impossible task to find a traveler who loves crowds and long lines. However, they\u2019re part of the price that most tourists have to pay to visit some of the world\u2019s most famous attractions, especially during peak times. It used to be that someone looking for a bargain could count on traveling in the shoulder or low season \u2013 for example, Italy was once more affordable in the fall, while Hong Kong was cheaper in the boiling-hot summer months. But the pandemic threw a lot of this conventional travel wisdom out the window. Many offices and schools switched to online-only, which provided people a rare opportunity to spend long periods away from home. Some companies kept those remote working policies after the pandemic ended, providing their workers with more opportunities to explore the world while still drawing a paycheck. All that tourism, though, comes with consequences. Practically every day there\u2019s a new headline about efforts to combat overtourism, such as new hotel bans in Amsterdam, photo-blocking barricades in Japan and mass protests in the Canary Islands. According to the United Nations, global travel  will return to pre-pandemic levels in 2024 \u2013 and could go higher. That, in turn, begs a question: Is there such a thing as an off-season anymore? \u201cOn the one hand, global travel is getting busier and busier,\u201d explains Olivier Ponti, a director at ForwardKeys, a Spain-based travel data and analysis company. \u201cThere are still some peak seasons and those peak seasons remain really busy, but the low seasons are getting busier and busier as well.\u201d Recently, ForwardKeys crunched some numbers in three of the world\u2019s most popular beach destinations: Thailand, Hawaii and the Maldives. Here\u2019s the math: take the total number of tourists in a year and divide that figure by 12, which works out to an average of 8% per month. Then, you can plot a graph to see which months are higher and lower than that total to determine when the peak season is. \u201cIn Thailand, low season typically spans from April to September with April and May being really hot,\u201d says Ponti. \u201cDuring this low season the tourist volumes each month constitute more than 7% of the annual total. That means very, very little seasonality.\u201d In other words? \u201cThere is no off-season anymore in a place like that.\u201d The climate change effect Arguably the biggest single factor affecting what we know as \u201cpeak season\u201d travel is weather. \u201cA lot of people tend to assume that the low season is defined as the time of the year when the weather is the crappiest,\u201d says Ged Brown, owner of the aptly-named tour company Low Season Traveller. But climate change is redefining what that \u201ccrappiest\u201d weather might be. A 2023 survey from the European Travel Commission reported that European travelers cited weather as their number-one factor in deciding where to go on vacation, with 8% of respondents saying they were concerned about extreme weather in European destinations. Heat waves in southern European countries like Italy, Spain and Greece caused a crisis last summer, with the trend only continuing upward. Multiple foreign tourists have gone missing or died amid extreme heat in Greece so far this season. More than 62,000 people died heat-related deaths in Europe in 2022, the continent\u2019s hottest summer on record. Following the devastating headlines, ForwardKeys\u2019 data shows an immediate spike in searches for summertime flights to northern European destinations like Denmark and Sweden. Mikey Sadowski, head of communications at tour organizer Intrepid Travel, says that the company has had to drop or reschedule some of its popular trips due to climate change. In Nepal, he says, there\u2019s an \u201cincrease of the monsoon season now. Snow is melting faster, the glaciers are melting faster, the water is running faster and routes that we normally could access before are no longer accessible. So we\u2019re actually having to shorten the [travel] seasons to avoid heavy monsoon time.\u201d Intrepid\u2019s own CEO canceled an Italian cruise with his mother because of hot weather concerns, Sadowski says. Beyond the thermostat Climate may be an important factor in booking a holiday, but it\u2019s not the only one. ForwardKeys\u2019 Ponti, himself a father of two, notes that many travelers have to plan their trips at the same time because they are working around school schedules. Some families choose to homeschool their children as a way to experience other parts of the world without being beholden to a schedule. The parents who opt to \u201cworldschool\u201d can travel during off-peak times \u2013 while also teaching their kids about different cultures. But every family\u2019s situation is different. For those whose kids are grown and out of the house or who don\u2019t have kids at all, there are more opportunities to be flexible when booking travel. Ann Woodward, a childfree American who has been living in Mexico for the past three years, makes a point of learning school schedules in her area so that she can plan around them. \u201cI am generally trying to not move, to not be on a plane, to not be on a bus, to not go to touristic attractions during those periods. I actually call it hiding,\u201d she laughs. Woodward, who has a pension from her last job in the US, can afford to travel for months at a time, preferring to choose one destination and rent an apartment rather than hop from place to place. For her, it\u2019s not just about saving money \u2013 it\u2019s about knowing her physical and emotional limits. \u201cI think that things that were acceptable and fun, even in my 20s and 30s, I can\u2019t handle anymore,\u201d she says. \u201cFor me, part of the past five years, I\u2019ve become much more focused on healing my nervous system. And I will say that I think I ignored it when I was living in New York, to be quite honest. I was ignoring a lot of cues from my body when I was living there when I was younger. So, whereas maybe an average person would be like, \u2018Wow, this park is really busy today,\u2019 or, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s lots of people in my photos,\u2019 I would just get there and turn around and leave. I just won\u2019t even engage.\u201d Still, Woodward acknowledges that she is in a privileged position. She spent much of her youth traveling and has already \u201cchecked off\u201d many of the big bucket list places that attract the most crowds, which means that she can now go to smaller towns and other less busy areas in addition to visiting during off-peak times. However, there are benefits from traveling during high seasons, especially when it comes to infrastructure. Some flights and train routes run more frequently \u2013 or only \u2013 during peak season. Travelers who go to less busy regions may find that shops and restaurants have more limited hours or close entirely when the flocks of visitors leave. Those without flexible schedules shouldn\u2019t feel like their future holds nothing but long, sweltering lines in overcrowded cities. Brown of Low Season Traveller puts together itineraries for adventurous travelers who are looking for a destination their friends haven\u2019t been to already \u2013 or those looking to get a less hectic experience at an old classic. \u201cIf your main purpose for travel is the most perfect weather, then yeah, you\u2019re going to pay a premium for that. And another premium that you\u2019re going to pay is the fact that it\u2019s going to be crowded and you\u2019re going to have to have queues and lines everywhere and find it difficult to get reservations and all of that kind of stuff,\u201d Brown says. \u201cFor me, the challenge is about finding the joy in those low seasons, finding those nuggets of gold.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/the-end-of-off-season-travel-cmb/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "travel"}}

The area\u2019s thermal features also provide a point of caution as tourists in one car found out this week. On Thursday, a car with five occupants inadvertently drove off a roadway and into the Semi-Centennial Geyser, according to a news release from the National Park Service.\u00a0\u00a0The vehicle was fully submerged in about 9 feet (2.75 meters) of hot water. All five were able to escape the vehicle, and they were taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, the release said. Law enforcement rangers closed both lanes of the roadway on Friday for about two hours near the accident scene to remove the car from the water, the release said. The incident is under investigation, the news release said. The Semi-Centennial Geyser thermal feature is acidic and has surface water temperatures ranging around 105 degrees Fahrenheit (40.5 Celsius), the release said.\u00a0There are five types of hydrothermal features visitors can easily see at the park: Hot springs, geysers, mud springs, travertine terraces (hot springs that rise up through limestone) and fumaroles (steam vents). There are more than 10,000 such features in Yellowstone, and there are more geysers in Yellowstone than anywhere else on Earth.

The country\u2019s northernmost metropolis, Harbin is the capital of Heilongjiang province. Also known as the Ice City, it experiences long, cold and snowy winters with short, cool summers.\u00a0The annual Harbin Ice and Snow Festival began in 1999 and is held every year from December to early March. A Guinness World Records official awarded the Harbin Ice and Snow World Company the certification for the \u201cworld\u2019s largest indoor ice and snow theme park\u201d during this month\u2019s opening ceremony. Ironically, the opening coincided with a heat wave in Harbin, with outdoor temperatures peaking at 29 degrees C (84 F),\u00a0while the indoor theme park maintained a chilly -8 C to\u00a0-12 C (17.6 F to 10.4 F) temperature. Covering an area of 23,800 square meters, the new Harbin Ice and Snow World Park, which opened on July 6, is divided into nine themed sections with 13 interactive projects. Utilizing advanced ice sculpting techniques and incorporating cutting-edge lighting, sound and interactive technologies, the park offers an immersive experience. The ice used in the construction of the park\u2019s attractions was sourced from the Songhua River, with a total ice volume of 20,000 cubic meters. Once inside, visitors can enjoy a magical atmosphere filled with ice, light, entertainment, gourmet food and cultural creations.\u00a0There are also vibrant ice sculptures of fruit, ice cream and cakes made using edible dyes through an environmentally-friendly special coloring process.

{"id": "travel_life-in-bhutan-intl-hnk", "text": "Located between China and India, the world\u2019s two most populous countries, high in the Himalayas, sits Bhutan. Known as the Land of the Thunder Dragon, it\u2019s a Buddhist monarchy of 700,000 residents that has only had regular television broadcasts since 1999. Most foreigners who have heard of Bhutan know two things: the country charges international visitors a $100/day sustainable development fee (aka tourist tax), and that it is the birthplace of the Gross National Happiness Index, a system intended to look after the well-being of citizens and the environment. As this once-hidden kingdom gradually opens up to the world, those things alone make it an intriguing travel destination, alongside historic temples, un-crowded hiking and trekking trails and stunning Himalayan landscapes. But is it really happy? And what does that mean for people living here? Its citizens have a variety of answers. \u201cThe first thing (foreigners) talk about is the gross national happiness that we promote in Bhutan,\u201d says KJ Temphel, founder of the conservation group Green Bhutan. \u201cI think definitely living in Bhutan, for me personally, it\u2019s quite peaceful and I\u2019m very happy to be here.\u201d The World Happiness Report, published annually by Oxford University and the United Nations, puts Nordic nations Finland, Sweden and Denmark at the top of its happiness rankings. The list ranks 143 nations and territories around the world \u2013 but Bhutan isn\u2019t one of them. \u201cI must say that our people were actually happy, but now due to all those modern things and all those technologies coming in, somehow we are disconnected more and then we tend to be more depressed and more sad,\u201d says Tandin Phubz, a creator of the Humans of Thimpu Facebook page, which features photos and profiles of everyday people in the capital in the style of Brandon Staunton\u2019s famous Humans of New York project. \u201cBhutan is a Buddhist country. Spirituality and religion have a very strong effect,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe thing is that with all those gadgets and televisions (people) are somehow distracted from this. They tend to forget to do their morning and evening prayers. They\u2019re on the phones watching TikToks, swiping up and down.\u201d Encountering the world Modernization is a relative term in Bhutan. Locals will proudly tell you that Thimpu is the only world capital without any traffic lights, and shops and restaurants are locally owned and run. Bhutan is the rare world destination that isn\u2019t full of international brands. While there are a few \u2013 outposts of the upscale Le Meridien and Aman hotel chains, for example \u2013 even the capital is mostly bereft of corporate logos. Entrepreneur Chokey Wangmo thinks it\u2019s unlikely that corporations like McDonald\u2019s and Starbucks would ever come to Bhutan \u2013 not because of local policies or customs, but because it wouldn\u2019t be a profitable market for them. \u201cOur population is so (small), we wouldn\u2019t be able to even get the money back for the franchise in the next 10 years,\u201d says Wangmo, who runs several businesses in the southern Bhutanese town of Gelephu, including a coffee shop. \u201cEven if the whole population comes and takes one coffee every day, it will be really hard for them to pay back (the franchise fee).\u201d Wangmo has a front-row seat to how Bhutan is changing. Gelephu, a town of about 10,000 people near the border of India\u2019s Darjeeling state, has been hand-selected as the site for a new \u201cMindfulness City,\u201d a project spearheaded by the country\u2019s king, Gyalpo Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck. It seems impossible to imagine Bhutan without the country\u2019s fifth monarch. Portraits of the king and royal family \u2013 he and Queen Jetsun Pema have three young children \u2013 are in nearly every home and business in Bhutan, displayed the way other nations might hang up their national flags. Photos of the king are omnipresent in the country\u2019s Buddhist temples, placed alongside pictures of lamas and laden with offerings of flowers, fruits and sweets. \u201cIf you look at the houses of the private enterprise, the rich people in Bhutan, their houses are huge and quite decorative,\u201d says Temphel. \u201cBut if you look at our royal family houses, they\u2019re very small and they\u2019re just a simple living and I think humble. And that\u2019s how it matters. How they think about the country and the people, I think. It\u2019s not thinking about themselves, but they\u2019re thinking about the people in the country.\u201d A generation on the brink A growing number of young people are leaving Bhutan to study and work overseas. Phubz, who is in his 20s and currently lives in Perth, Australia pursuing a master\u2019s in communications, is part of Bhutan\u2019s new generation, balancing his love of family and heritage with a desire to see more of the world. \u201cThere\u2019s this Bhutanese quote where it says that, \u2018You do whatever the neighbor does. If he or she goes and milks the cow, you go and milk the cow. If they go and work in the fields, you go and work in the fields.\u2019\u201d He compares this to the current trend of young people leaving to work and study abroad. \u201cParents feel that, \u2018Oh, that neighbor\u2019s son or daughter is going to Australia, I have to send (mine) as well.\u2019\u201d Temphel echoes those sentiments, saying he is worried that Bhutan will have a big population imbalance with more old people than young ones, similar to other Asian countries like Japan and South Korea. \u201cMy worry is after seven years staying in other countries, you are more acquainted with the custom, the habits that you have in different countries, it would be very difficult for them to adjust immediately in Bhutan,\u201d he says. Those Bhutanese who do want to explore the wider world can\u2019t just grab their suitcases and head off. Only three countries have diplomatic embassies in Thimpu, which means that most international relationships have to go via India. Bhutan\u2019s currency, the ngultrum, is pegged to the Indian rupee, and most shops and businesses will accept both. The Henley Passport Index ranks Bhutan\u2019s passport 87th most powerful in the world, with its holders able to access 55 places visa-free \u2013 a list that does not include the United States, Australia or the European Union. Bhutan\u2019s sole international aviation hub, Paro International (PBH), is one of the most beautiful airport descents in the world \u2013 but also one of the most logistically challenging. Located in a valley between two mountains, only smaller planes can come in and out safely. As a result, Paro only offers short hops to nearby Bangkok, Dhaka, Kathmandu and New Delhi. Some of those logistics may become easier, though. In addition to being the home of the new Mindfulness City, Gelephu has been chosen for a new international airport. Its flatter terrain means that there will be space for longer runways \u2013 and, likely, jumbo jets that can go all the way to the Middle East, Europe and beyond. According to government data, the per capita income in Bhutan is 115,787 ngultrum ($1,387) per year. When a flight from Paro to Bangkok begins at $350, international travel is still out of reach for many Bhutanese. Foreigners who want to emigrate to Bhutan, though, don\u2019t have it easy. Only Bhutanese citizens can buy land, and the only way to get Bhutanese citizenship \u2013 even if you\u2019re married to someone from Bhutan \u2013 is by the personal approval of the king. What comes next Wangmo, who spent her student years in India before returning to Bhutan, has been able to see her homeland from both a local and foreign perspective. \u201cThe way we are living is old now,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have to learn and accept new ways.\u201d She gives several examples of workplace culture that she thinks have made it harder for business owners: for example, she couldn\u2019t find a bank in Bhutan that would allow her to fill out account paperwork online instead of going in person. Wangmo says that things like meeting scheduling, out-of-office messages, and online customer service generally don\u2019t exist in Bhutanese offices. Most jobs in Bhutan require traditional dress \u2013 a one-piece garment called a gho paired with knee-high socks for men, and a two-piece jacket and skirt set called a kari for women \u2013 to be worn while working, but some will swap into jeans and T-shirts on weekends. Temphel, of Green Bhutan, says that the Bhutanese mindset is community-centric, where everyone knows each other and looks out for each other. It\u2019s common for neighbors to stop by uninvited and for the whole village to visit a new baby or welcome someone back from the hospital. For Wangmo, this sense of community spirit can sometimes be stifling. She says that she has a hard time telling people that she wants to eat dinner alone or that she doesn\u2019t want guests over every day. And despite Bhutan\u2019s free public health care system, she believes one critical thing is missing \u2013 honesty around mental health. At Coffee Cat Caf\u00e9, which she owns and manages in Gelephu, patrons are encouraged to talk about their mental health with each other. Wangmo says that many people hit a breaking point during the pandemic as forced isolation took them out of the networks they knew so well. \u201cNobody was socializing because of the Covid thing,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd then, once they started talking, they understood how important it was to talk about what they were feeling. And I think that is really when the mental health (conversation) really came into light. Mental health, I think, it\u2019s a very, very personal struggle.\u201d To make it easier for people to open up, Coffee Cat Caf\u00e9 holds events like poetry readings. There are motivational quotes written on the walls and a well-stocked lending library. On their social media accounts, there are campaigns about ending period stigma and encouraging female entrepreneurs. For Wangmo, who is training her restaurant and caf\u00e9 staff to have a more tourist-centric mindset, change hasn\u2019t come quickly enough. \u201cJust because we are wearing different clothes and having all these cars from other countries, it\u2019s not going to get us there,\u201d she says. \u201c(Change is) going to hit us hard. Some people are not happy, some people are scared, they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, if they can survive it. But when we are one faith, we have to do this, there\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t do.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/life-in-bhutan-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_eat-until-youre-bankrupt-japan-osaka", "text": "Let\u2019s be honest. Osaka hasn\u2019t got Tokyo\u2019s mind-bending urban sprawl, where every turn opens up a world of adventure. Likewise, it lacks the historic temples, tree-covered hills and ancient history of Kyoto. What it does have, though, are two of the biggest draws any visitor to Japan could ask for. The best food anywhere in the country. And the people, who are funky, fun and playful. This is a place to come and eat, enjoy the odd local brew and take in a city where day-to-day pleasures come to the fore unlike anywhere else. Food is practically a religion in Osaka, which is now anticipating the global spotlight as it gears up to host Expo 2025. It is known as the kitchen of Japan, and, for foodies, any tour of its myriad culinary delights must start in Dotonbori. The streets along either side of the Dotonbori Canal, between the D\u014dtonboribashi Bridge and Nipponbashi Bridge, in the city\u2019s Namba district, are the place to spend a gut-busting afternoon. You\u2019ll know you\u2019re in the right place when you see restaurants adorned with huge, moving mechanical crabs and octopus models looming above, demanding you come inside and eat. Octopus is, unquestionably, the main ingredient here, the essential part of Osaka\u2019s great gift to Japan: takoyaki. Dough balls filled with diced octopus, fried until blisteringly hot, they can be picked up for on-the-go snacking wherever you turn. However, as Tokyo-based CNN producer Junko Ogura says, these are not for eating in one go. \u201cIt\u2019s really hot,\u201d she says. \u201cJust be careful. Not the whole thing!\u201d Of course, few tourists can resist this approach, even if it does leave them with a scorched mouth. Takoyaki is, however, just the start. As Junko explains, Osakans even have a saying for their food-based obsessions. \u201cKuidaore.\u201d It basically means: \u201cEat in Osaka like you\u2019re going to go bankrupt.\u201d That goes for easing succulent crab meat from its shell with chopsticks and dining on ultra-fresh sushi, with chefs working their magic and handing you the result to wolf down immediately. On Sennichimae Doguyasuji \u2013 aka \u201ckitchen shopping street\u201d \u2013 you can pick up the finest Japanese knives and cooking equipment, so you can continue to craft your own dishes back home. \u2018You look healthy, I love you\u2019 There is, though, one dish that you\u2019ll need to set aside a chunk of change for. Something so succulent and delicious that it has become renowned the world over. Kobe beef. Readily available in Dotonbori and across Osaka, this delicacy\u2019s reputation precedes it. This is meat reared to the most exacting standards, with prices to match. A kilo of Kobe grade 11 sirloin can go for $300 or more. Boarding a Shinkansen bullet train from the heart of Osaka, you can be in Kobe in just half an hour. The cows are raised just outside the city under strict conditions. Those who\u2019ve been in Japan for less than seven days cannot come into contact with them. In fact, to speak with a farmer involved in their care requires CNN\u2019s Junko to call them via Zoom. When asked how the cattle are treated compared with other cows, the farmer is effusive in his explanation. \u201cHe [touches] them as much as possible, talks to them and says, \u2018you look cute, you look healthy, I love you,\u2019\u201d says Junko, translating the farmer\u2019s words. If that seems out there, you can add in the well-worn fact that farmers massage and pet their cows. The farmer himself says that after three years of care, he is sad to see his charges head off to be slaughtered, but is happy in the knowledge that they provide happiness to those who eat them. Succulent, and with a melt-in-the-mouth texture, Kobe beef is arguably the best on Earth, a cornerstone of any foodie outing in Osaka. Let\u2019s all go to the ball game After all that food, a spot of exercise tends to be the order of the day. Like so many parts of Japan, Osaka is obsessed with baseball. The game has been a fixture in this part of the world since it was first introduced in 1872. Today, baseball is played by all ages, from kids in little league right through to octogenarians enjoying a pick-up game on a summer afternoon. It\u2019s as much about watching as it is playing, however. The local team is the Hanshin Tigers, one of the most storied baseball franchises in Japan. The club began life in 1936 and briefly played as the Osaka Tigers, before reverting to Hanshin, the city 20 minutes west, where it plays at Koshien Stadium. Long seen as an underdog, the Tigers won the Japan Series in 2023, breaking a 38-year hoodoo called \u201cThe Curse of the Colonel,\u201d believed to have been caused by overly excited fans throwing a statue of KFC legend Colonel Sanders into the Dotonbori Canal when they last won the title 1985. Hardcore fans attend every game, including Takada, a local man who spells out his priorities while sitting in the bleachers waiting for a rain-delayed game to get going. \u201cHanshin Tigers number one,\u201d he says with a smile. \u201cHanshin Tigers. Then family. Then work or career.\u201d Takada says he wept when the Tigers won the pennant in 2023, hugging friends and crying so much that tears came out of his nose. Even today\u2019s game being called off can\u2019t dampen his spirits. A long soak If a love of nonstop action seems to be behind Osakans\u2019 fun and playful attitude, respite is at hand in the city\u2019s many marvelous onsens. These natural springs are part of a classic culture and require an etiquette all of their own. Tattoos must be covered, owing to body art being viewed historically in Japan as something that only adorned yakuza gangsters. Participants must be naked and are separated into men\u2019s and women\u2019s baths, ready for a wash and long soak at the end of a busy day at work. In the onsen, it\u2019s all about \u201cnaked friendship,\u201d a place where everybody is equal, much like the sauna cultures of Finland and Estonia. The beautiful countryside surrounding Osaka is full of them, but city center baths are easy to find too, making them an ideal spot to take time out and even meet a few local people \u2013 albeit without any clothes on. Osaka is, after all, a city of flavors and friendship. A place where you can eat royally and spend time doing so with people who are obsessed with the best food and making sure everyone receives the finest hospitality. It\u2019s on show in restaurants, ballparks and onsens, too. Somewhere you need to go all out and make peace with the fact you might go \u201cKuidaore.\u201d Tokyo and Kyoto may be the cities known for having it all in Japan. But it\u2019s important to always make time for Osaka.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/eat-until-youre-bankrupt-japan-osaka/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_article_how-to-survive-rattlesnake-bite", "text": "Talk about a heavenly day: The Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, temperatures in the low 70s and low humidity. Scott Vuncannon, a 58-year-old real estate developer and farmer, called his wife and said he was going hiking and would be back around 4 p.m.  He packed his safety gear, including a pistol, bear spay and enough food and water to last a couple of days, just in case. He grew up traversing the Uwharrie Mountains in central North Carolina. Now he was taking on more formidable wilderness from his summer home in Highlands, a popular resort town. Still, he had decades of hiking experience. With a 2-year-old Australian shepherd-blue heeler mix named Boone at his side, he headed to the Ellicott Rock Trail around 11 a.m. Wednesday in late August 2018. Two hours later, he was five miles in. \u201cMy dog took off chasing a squirrel, and I stopped and took a sip of water,\u201d Vuncannon recalled to CNN Travel. \u201cI called my dog \u2026 and he came headed back over. And as soon as I took a step, I saw movement.\u201d With no warning, \u201cI saw a snake head come up and strike me in my left calf. \u2026 My natural reaction was to jump back, and I bent over and pulled up my pant leg to see if he actually penetrated my long pants.\u201d Vuncannon saw two bite marks about 2 inches apart. Boone went after the snake, and only then did Vuncannon hear rattling. He tied on a tourniquet below the knee and above the bite. \u201cAs soon as I stood up, I could actually taste the poison in the back of my throat.\u201d His vision got blurry, and he sweated a lot. \u201cI pulled my phone my out and called 911, and of course, it said no cell service.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s when my heart sank.\u201d With no phone service, no human companions and the venom spreading rapidly, how would he survive? How dangerous are rattlesnakes to us?   Vuncannon was in known rattlesnake country. Their range is extensive in the Americas \u2013 from southern Canada to central Argentina. The thickest concentration is in the US Southwest and northern Mexico, according to the National Wildlife Federation. The estimated 36 rattlesnake species are adaptable, living in forests, grasslands, swamps and deserts. They may take up residence where people live and work. But for their range, US deaths from rattlesnake bites and other venomous snakes are quite rare.  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates about 7,000 to 8,000 people are bitten by venomous snakes in the United States each year. About five of those people die.  \u201cThe number of deaths would be much higher if people did not seek medical care,\u201d the CDC says. World estimates for death by venomous snakebite are much higher \u2013 81,000 to 138,000 a year. The pit viper family   Rattlesnakes are \u201cpit vipers\u201d with heat-detecting pits on their heads.  Other US snakes in that family are copperheads and cottonmouths, also called water moccasins. These latter  two species are concentrated in the central and eastern United States, whereas multiple species of rattlesnakes range across the United States.  Most pit vipers typically deliver a \u201chemotoxic\u201d venom that attacks the circulation system, destroying blood vessels and causing tissue damage. The only other venomous snakes in the United States are coral snakes. Known for their bright bands of red, yellow and black, they are in a different snake family that\u2019s related to cobras. They deliver a neurotoxin that disrupts nerve transmission and can cause respiratory failure and paralysis.    You\u2019re scared? So is the rattlesnake  Rattlesnakes\u2019 reclusive nature is one reason why there aren\u2019t more incidents. The rattlesnake \u201cactually views us as a predator; we\u2019re a large animal that could eat him. And they\u2019re afraid of us,\u201d said Ted Clamp, who founded the Edisto Island Serpentarium in coastal South Carolina in 1999 with his late brother.  Rattlesnakes tend to stay hidden.  \u201cWhen we encounter a snake on the move, he\u2019s usually looking for food or looking for a mate or looking for shelter. Otherwise, he stays hidden because they\u2019re so vulnerable to all sorts of predators.\u201d  Kimberly Andrews, who has a doctorate in ecology from University of Georgia\u2019s Marine Extension and Georgia Sea Grant and manages its Coastal Ecology Lab, said rattlesnakes are \u201csit-and-wait predators.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve seen rattlesnakes sit in one place for over a week waiting on a meal.\u201d So when there\u2019s an encounter, people have generally encroached on their territory. Where rattlesnakes hide  Rattlesnakes \u201chunt shelter constantly. They hide under these logs. They hide in stump holes \u2013 under anything they can,\u201d Clamp said. They also like woodpiles, thick brush and spaces under boulders, experts say. Clamp cited a case of a 12-year-old South Carolina boy playing at a log pile who got bit by a canebreak (timber) rattlesnake. He lived but only after a six-week hospital stay. Rodents are much more likely to get into your house than snakes, Andrews said. If snakes do get into your house, it\u2019s most likely you have a rodent infestation. Andrews said rattlesnakes play a key role in balancing the environment. \u201cThey\u2019re mostly eating mice and rats. \u2026 They\u2019re out there doing free pest control,\u201d she said. How to avoid a bite  Clamp and Andrews shared advice on how not to be a statistic. \u201cAlways be careful where you put your hands and your feet,\u201d Clamp said. \u201cIf you have a woodpile, go out and get your wood for the night during the day when you can see,\u201d Andrews added. Wear thick gloves. \u201cIf you\u2019re reaching under your house, shine a light under there. Make sure the coast is clear,\u201d she said. Other tips: \u2022 Wear closed-toe shoes and long pants when venturing into rattlesnake-friendly terrain. \u2022 Go around a rattlesnake on a wilderness trail if possible.  \u2022 If you find a rattlesnake in your yard, call agencies such as your state\u2019s natural resources departments or US Fish & Wildlife or contact a biologist at a local college, Andrews said. Do not try to kill the rattlesnake because that\u2019s when most people get bit, she said. \u2022 If you must deal with a rattlesnake on your own, Andrews says you can use a long branch or pole to gently nudge the snake toward an escape route if you\u2019re at least six feet or more away.   Andrews said rattlesnakes are most active in spring and fall, but vigilance is important all year. They might venture out in winter on a warm day. What do you do if you hear that bone-chilling rattle? \u201cUsually if he\u2019s rattling, he\u2019s alarmed,\u201d Clamp said. \u201cIf you can tell where he is and see him, back away from him. Don\u2019t approach him.\u201d Just know rattling does not come before every bite, as in Vuncannon\u2019s case. In dire straits Vuncannon knew he had to get out. \u201cI slowly, methodically started walking up the mountain, a pretty steep climb.\u201d He had only gone about a quarter of a mile when he lost his balance. He started crawling. Vuncannon was throwing up about every 15 minutes. Then he started to go in and out of consciousness.  \u201cMy dog stayed with me the whole time. He never left my side. He would paw at me and lick me in the face to keep me awake.\u201d About two hours after being bit, he fired a shot from his pistol into the air to get attention. Nothing. Back in Highlands, his wife had a gnawing feeling something was amiss. She found his truck at the trailhead around 4:30, and returned to town for help. Around 5:30, a rescue attempt was finally underway. \u201cJust so happens around 5:30, I had pretty much given in that I wasn\u2019t going to make it out alive. So I went ahead and made a goodbye video to my family with my phone. I recorded about a three-minute video; I couldn\u2019t talk clearly because my throat was so swollen.\u201d It was getting dark, and Boone start to growl. Vuncannon saw a black blur moving his way and feared a bear was coming to finish the rattlesnake\u2019s job.  What to do if a rattlesnake bites you  \u201cIf you are bitten, you need to seek medical attention as quickly as possible,\u201d Clamp said. \u201cIf you know it\u2019s a really serious bite, you should probably call EMS to come get you.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll know if you have a serious bite in just a couple of minutes. \u2026 You can start to feel tingling in your face.\u201d According to the California Poison Control System, other symptoms could include: \u2022 Extreme pain and swelling at the bite\u2022 Lots of bleeding\u2022 Nausea, lightheadedness and drooling\u2022 Swelling in the mouth and throat And if you can\u2019t make that SOS call? \u201cKeep your heartbeat as low as possible. It takes a while for the venom to work. Don\u2019t run. [But] get yourself somewhere you can get a signal as soon as possible,\u201d Clamp said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to really help you from the venom except the serum.\u201d  The snakebite victim should stay as calm as possible and deep breathe, Andrews said. If someone can stay with the victim, that person should talk to them and keep them from falling asleep.  Take notes or voice record on a smartphone what happened, she said. If possible, use a marker or pen and circle where you were bitten in case of swelling. They\u2019ll need to know the bite point at the hospital. Remove jewelry such as rings and tight clothing before you start to swell, the Mayo Clinic says.  What not to do Andrews said don\u2019t employ the out-of-date Boy Scout advice of cut-and-suck (cutting an X at the bite area and sucking the venom out by mouth or suction cups). \u201cIt\u2019s very ineffective,\u201d she said, adding people are likely to do more damage from the knife cut than from the snake bite.  Don\u2019t try to kill the snake to bring to the hospital, Andrews said, and don\u2019t take a picture of it unless you can do so easily. \u201cDon\u2019t comprise your safety by forcing another interaction with an already defensive rattlesnake.\u201d   Clamp, Andrews and other experts say do not apply a tourniquet to a pit viper bite (which is something Vuncannon did). That venom is \u201cconcentrated, and it works like an acid. It breaks down blood vessels and multiple skin tissues,\u201d Clamp said. \u201cAnd if you confine that venom in that area, you\u2019re apt to lose a limb from that. If you allow it to spread, you\u2019re more apt to keep your hand or fingers.\u201d In updated advice, the Boy Scouts and other experts say don\u2019t apply ice or cold packs to the bite and don\u2019t use Advil, Motrin or other nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs. Clamp and Andrews said your response should be the same no matter which type of pit viper bites you. \u201cThe best emergency response to a snakebite is car keys and a cell phone,\u201d Andrews said. Vuncannon\u2019s rescue and recovery   Fortunately, that was not a bear Vuncannon saw but a rescuer\u2019s black lab. However, it was getting dark, and Vuncannon was getting worse.  A helicopter couldn\u2019t be used because of the thick canopy. Vuncannon was too far gone to be slowly carried out. So he was moved by motorcycle, strapped to a driver and held up by paramedics walking on either side. That took three hours.  More than 11 hours after he first got bit, he made it to Mission Hospital in Asheville, but he had already gone into cardiac arrest. Doctors had bad news for his family. Vuncannon had less than a 5% chance to survive. His rescue was one miracle, and he needed a second one. He got around a dozen antivenom treatments and other medical interventions. Vuncannon was in a coma for three days but pulled through. \u201cIt took me a total of about three months to fully recover enough to where I could actually walk and have the energy to get around.\u201d He later learned it was a timber rattlesnake that bit him and that it directly hit a vein, which made the venom spread more rapidly but later spared him from tissue damage.  What Vuncannon learned He\u2019s back on the trails, but he carries a satellite phone, especially on deeper trails. He\u2019s also more likely to find someone to hike with him. If he goes alone, it\u2019s on wider, well-maintained trails. \u201cAnd I also carry hiking poles with me to brush the side of the trail just in case. Let someone know exactly where you\u2019re going, when you\u2019ll be back.\u201d He now has three grandchildren. \u201cI look forward to teaching them about the wilderness and the outdoors and how to avoid snake bites and dangerous encounters.\u201d  Andrews applauds learning about snakes, so that you can keep your family safe and \u201cactually enjoy a venomous snake sighting, something that is comparatively rare and can be pretty special.\u201d Clamp pointed out pit vipers can be lifesavers, too. They\u2019re important to us \u201cbecause a tremendous amount of research has been done with different venoms,\u201d noting some FDA-approved, lifesaving drugs are derived from snake venom.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/article/how-to-survive-rattlesnake-bite/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_married-southwest-pilots", "text": "On their first flight together, Joel Atkinson and Shelley Atkinson couldn\u2019t contain their excitement. They enthused to the flight attendants. They posed for photos. They told passengers via a pre-flight announcement. \u201cWe made a big deal about it,\u201d Joel tells CNN Travel. Then, right before take off, Joel and Shelley sat side by side in the flight deck, just the two of them. They\u2019d come full circle, and were about to embark on an exciting new chapter. \u201cIt felt amazing,\u201d Shelley tells CNN Travel. \u201cAs we prepared to take off, I was giddy, euphoric,\u201d says Joel. Joel and Shelley met as twentysomethings flying jets in the US Air Force. They became fast friends, then, over time, fell in love. Today, they\u2019ve been married for 27 years and counting. They\u2019ve brought up two kids together. And now they\u2019re both pilots for Southwest Airlines. They regularly fly together, with Joel as captain and Shelley as first officer. The couple say working together is \u201camazing.\u201d They treat layovers as \u201cdate nights.\u201d They learn from one another\u2019s respective \u201cwisdom and judgment.\u201d And no, they don\u2019t argue mid-flight. \u201cPeople ask us, how does it work, flying together?\u201d says Joel. \u201cWe know a few pilot couples and some of them fly together, some of them don\u2019t. I\u2019ve heard people say, \u2018Oh I could never fly with my wife or my husband.\u2019\u201d For Joel and Shelley, working together is seamless \u2013 a joy that comes easily to them both. \u201cWe\u2019re best friends,\u201d says Shelley. \u201cThere\u2019s just that unspoken bond,\u201d says Joel. Inspired by \u2018Top Gun\u2019 Shelley grew up in Iowa and moved to Colorado \u2013 Joel\u2019s home state \u2013 as a teenager. The two spent their high school years unaware of one another, but they graduated the same year, and both opted to study at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado in the late 1980s. Joel says he was very influenced by the 1985 Tom Cruise movie \u201cTop Gun\u201d \u2013 \u201cwhich made flying jets look like a lot of fun.\u201d For Shelley, who was an athlete, the appeal of the Air Force Academy was less about flying \u2013 which she only really discovered once she was enrolled \u2013 and more an opportunity to play college basketball. \u201cI didn\u2019t attend the Academy to pursue flying, initially. Once I was there I realized it was a great opportunity for a fun and challenging career,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the introduction to flying there made me want to pursue it further.\u201d Joel and Shelley spent four years studying at the Air Force Academy without actually crossing paths, although Joel was vaguely aware of Shelley. \u201cThere\u2019s not that many women at the Air Force Academy, so I kind of knew who she was,\u201d he says. The two finally met a few years later, after they\u2019d both completed pilot training in different states. They got the same first assignment \u2013 flying Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft in Texas. When Shelley arrived in Texas, Joel had been there for a few months. \u201cSo I was there, kind of established, and she came into the office where I was working,\u201d he recalls. \u201cShe came in and turned in the paperwork, and we said, \u2018Hi,\u2019 just exchanged some pleasantries.\u201d Joel was struck by Shelley right away. \u201cShe\u2019s tall. She looks great. She left the room and this other coworker was just looking at me smiling. And I said, \u2018What?\u2019 And he could tell.\u201d Looking back, Joel thinks it was the \u201ceye contact\u201d he had with Shelley that gave his feelings away. Or maybe just \u201cthe look on my face.\u201d \u201cThere was something there,\u201d says Joel, smiling. \u201cBut I just kind of laughed it off. I was like, \u2018Nah, we\u2019re just going to be friends.\u2019\u201d Joel was also a bit intimidated by Shelley \u2013 he was \u201cattracted to her right away,\u201d but didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d ever be interested in him. \u201cShe\u2019s taller than me. And I had never dated anyone taller than me,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s an athlete, she\u2019s a natural leader, and just an impressive person.\u201d But Joel\u2019s warm nature appealed to Shelley. She felt comfortable around him right away. They became close friends. \u201cJoel has a really great sense of humor,\u201d says Shelley. \u201cI love that about him. And he just really has a sensitive heart to people, all people around him, he looks out for people.\u201d \u201cThat really attracted me to him. And also, he used to have a nice dark head of hair. I really liked that too. But he has a very distinguished look now, and he\u2019s just as handsome as ever.\u201d About a year after they first met, Joel and Shelley were deployed abroad, together. That\u2019s when they \u201ckind of started dating,\u201d as Joel puts it. While there wasn\u2019t much opportunity to go on actual dates on active service, they bonded. \u201cConversations, talking about everything, basically,\u201d says Shelley. \u201cWe really got to know each other\u2019s heart that way. And I think it just made it clear that this is what we were supposed to do.\u201d Back home in the US, the two \u201cstarted officially dating.\u201d \u201cWe just kind of knew that this was going to be it,\u201d says Joel. \u201cAnd within a few months, we got married.\u201d Joel and Shelley became instructor Air Force pilots in Mississippi. Then, in the early 2000s, Shelley gave birth to the couple\u2019s kids, two twins, a boy and a girl. Shelley left flying around this time, but she stayed in the military, working for the US Air National Guard. \u201cI wanted to be at home,\u201d says Shelley. The path to pregnancy wasn\u2019t easy for the couple and Joel calls their kids a \u201chuge blessing.\u201d \u201cWe went through in vitro a couple of times,\u201d he says. \u201cIt took a few years for us to actually get pregnant.\u201d The family relocated back to Colorado and Joel transitioned from military flying to commercial flying, becoming a pilot with Southwest Airlines in 2006. Returning to the air Cut to 2021. The pandemic years were tough going for Joel and Shelley, emotionally speaking. While the couple stayed healthy, their kids were in their late teens and struggled with the upheaval. Plus, Covid was impacting the aviation industry, so Joel was flying less. Around this time, Shelley left her job at the National Guard. She and Joel were wholly focused on their family and their kids\u2019 wellbeing. But in time, the pandemic waned and Joel started flying more regularly. Joel and Shelley\u2019s kids graduated high school and started the next phase of their lives. It was a transitional period for the Atkinson family, and in turn, Shelley started considering her future. She found herself dreaming about flying. She hadn\u2019t been behind the controls of a plane in over two decades, but she felt a call to return. She started wondering if, like Joel, she could become a commercial pilot. When Shelley voiced the idea to Joel, he was immediately enthusiastic. \u201cI said, \u2018Come fly with me,\u2019\u201d says Joel, joking \u201ccue the music.\u201d Then, by coincidence, later that day, Joel saw a social media post from his airline, Southwest, about a pilot who\u2019d taken a two decade break to raise a family, then returned to flying. \u201cShe literally had the same story as me,\u201d says Shelley. It felt like a sign. While Joel didn\u2019t know this other pilot directly, he was able to reach out to her via his work network and pass on contact details to Shelley, who subsequently texted the other pilot, asking for guidance and advice. Then, with encouragement from her new friend \u2013 plus Joel\u2019s wholehearted support \u2013 Shelley committed to returning to the skies full time. While Shelley had years of Air Force experience, she hadn\u2019t flown airplanes for 20 years. She had had to hit the books, take additional tests and ensure her qualifications were up to speed. But before long Shelley was hired by SkyWest Airlines, flying regional jets. Then she joined Joel at Southwest in 2023. \u201cIt was crazy. It happened way faster than I thought it would. It\u2019s been amazing,\u201d says Shelley. \u201cIt was meant to be,\u201d says Joel. Flying together Joel and Shelley credit their success as a co-pilot team to their nearly three decades of marriage, as well as years of co-parenting. \u201cRaising two teenagers during Covid, I tell people that was a lot harder than what we\u2019re doing now,\u201d says Joel. Plus, the two met as colleagues \u2013 so they know how to balance commitment to a job with enjoying each other\u2019s company. Still, as a married couple in the military, Joel and Shelley never flew in the same aircraft. \u201cThe military kind of frowns upon it,\u201d says Joel. \u201cIt\u2019s a little morbid, but they don\u2019t want you to both go down in a plane crash.\u201d No such guidelines exist in commercial aviation, and so once Shelley joined Southwest, she and Joel were able to work side by side. Joel\u2019s seniority allows him to regularly bid for flights with Shelley. And the two find Joel\u2019s years of commercial aviation experience pairs well with Shelley\u2019s fresh take. \u201cShe looks to me and relies on me for the experience that I have. But I also know that she is a very sharp person, she just went through a lot of training. So her knowledge is fresh. And she also has that wisdom and judgment,\u201d says Joel. Since the excitement of their first flight, Joel and Shelley tend not to \u201cmake a big deal\u201d about being a husband and wife pilot duo \u2013 unless it\u2019s preempted by their colleagues. \u201cWe wait for them to ask,\u201d says Shelley. As the couple share the same last name, often crew members put two and two together. As Joel\u2019s the more senior of the two, he often runs the pre-flight briefing. Sometimes he\u2019ll end it with a quick, throwaway: \u201cYes, we\u2019re married.\u201d The crew usually \u201cstart laughing,\u201d says Joel. When Joel and Shelley are taking off and landing, they\u2019re focused on the job at hand. \u201cIt\u2019s very technical,\u201d says Joel. \u201cWe\u2019re running checklists.\u201d But when the airplane reaches cruising altitude, \u201cthere\u2019s some downtime\u201d and Joel and Shelley will make the most of it, talking through their thoughts on life, their kids, their future plans and everything else that\u2019s on their mind. \u201cIt\u2019s so great, because all the years that I was flying, and she was at home, anything I wanted to talk to her about when I\u2019m up in the air, it had to wait,\u201d says Joel. \u201cYou\u2019re saving up conversations until you\u2019re home. It\u2019s like now we\u2019re making up for lost time.\u201d Then, when they land, Joel and Shelley make the most of the layovers. Southwest largely flies domestically, so the couple enjoy traveling the length and breadth of the US together. \u201cIt is a great job, because you go see different places and spend time in different cities,\u201d says Joel, but before Shelley joined Southwest, Joel says layovers sometimes felt like \u201cwasted time, because it was just me, and I couldn\u2019t share it with her.\u201d \u201cBut now we\u2019re together when we\u2019re on the road \u2013 it\u2019s so fun. Because every night on the road, it\u2019s a date night together,\u201d he says. Now, instead of counting the days until he\u2019s home, Joel says his \u201chome is right here\u201d because \u201cshe\u2019s with me.\u201d Family connection While Joel and Shelley have flown together countless times since Shelley joined Southwest, they\u2019ve yet to fly with their kids in tow. That\u2019s on the to-do list \u2013 plus, their son is also training to be a pilot, so there\u2019s a chance Shelley and Joel might pilot an aircraft with him in the future. For Shelley, an additional perk of the last couple of years is her adult kids getting to \u201cview her as a pilot for the first time.\u201d Shelley and Joel\u2019s children grew up knowing their parents met flying jets \u2013 but\u00a0while they saw their father regularly piloting airplanes for Southwest, they never saw Shelley flying. Shelley is really happy her children get to see her doing a job she loves. Shelley\u2019s also proud to be a female pilot in an industry that\u2019s still very male-dominated. She hopes to inspire other people, especially mothers who may have taken a break from the workplace to raise a family, by demonstrating that returning to a passion is possible. \u201cI hope it encourages other women that there is this opportunity out there \u2013 you can come back and you can still do it,\u201d she says. Shelley says she\u2019s really loved rediscovering her love of flying. \u201cThe view from 36,000 feet is pretty awesome,\u201d she says. \u201cFlying over parts of the country - I just love looking down and going, \u2018Oh, what town is that?\u2019\u201d Shelley and Joel particularly enjoy flying in and out of San Diego, California, but they also love it when Southwest takes them to New York. Before Christmas, they enjoyed a stopover in New York City and went searching for the settings of their favorite movies, from \u201cElf\u201d to \u201cSerendipity.\u201d \u201cI love traveling, seeing new places,\u201d says Joel, who adds that he\u2019s gone from avoiding working weekends to voluntarily signing up for Saturday and Sunday flight shifts. He and Shelley now spend Saturday nights watching jazz in Portland, going on hikes in Sacramento or drinking cocktails in Palm Springs. Joel\u2019s always loved flying \u2013 especially what he calls \u201cthe art and science\u201d of aviation. He also loves \u201cserving people, getting them to where they need to be,\u201d but he admits flying during the pandemic was hard going. For Joel, having Shelley now by his side at work has \u201cbeen just a complete turnaround.\u201d Now even the ride to work is fun as the couple car share, coffees in hand. Joel and Shelley, who post about their adventures on their Instagram account @luvpilots, are currently planning to pick up a flight together on Valentine\u2019s Day. Joel bought the two of them heart-printed ties especially \u2013 they\u2019re \u201csilly, but fun,\u201d says Joel. The couple enjoy chronicling their travels on social media \u2013 celebrating their marriage, their respective careers and their adventures. \u201cWe feel blessed. We\u2019re thankful for the opportunity,\u201d says Joel. \u201cWe\u2019re thankful to Southwest Airlines for letting us do this together.\u201d \u201cIf you love doing something, why not do it with the person you love?\u201d says Shelley.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/married-southwest-pilots/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_little-britain-inn-germany-gary-blackburn", "text": "Rolling hills, thick forests and the Rhine River whirling through it all \u2013 the region of Rheinland-Pfalz, or Rhineland-Palatinate, is textbook Germany. Nearby Bonn was the capital of West Germany from 1949 to 1990, and before that, the Romantic movement descended on the castles and wooded landscapes of the region. For many, this is Deutschland at its finest. And yet one corner of it is not German at all. In the quiet village of Vettelschloss, half an hour south of Cologne, is a patch of land that, to all accounts and purposes belongs to Germany\u2019s old rival: England. \u201cWelcome to Little Britain,\u201d says a banner slung between two houses \u2013 a banner draped in the colors of the Union Jack, the UK flag. The entrance is guarded by two huge statues of lions (like the ones in Trafalgar Square), grenadier guards and a line-up of classic British cars. If that\u2019s not enough, there\u2019s also a life-size resin figure of the late Queen Elizabeth sitting on a bench beside the door, observing the comings and goings. Oh, and Prince William stands grinning behind a bench, next to those grenadier guards. Welcome to the Little Britain Inn, a corner of Germany that shall remain forever England. Step inside to a traditional British pub, where portraits of \u201cPeaky Blinders\u201d actors and lifesize Paddington Bears are your neighbors. Through the doorway is the restaurant, frescoed with medieval-style images of Robin Hood and his merry men. Upstairs, and across two buildings are the bedrooms \u2013 each themed with something British, from James Bond to her late majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, frescoed on the wall. While outside, in a space open to all, is a magical mystery tour of all things British. There are two double decker buses and lifesize statues of characters from film, TV and literature, from Mr. Bean and Jack Sparrow to Alice in Wonderland and Shaun the Sheep. Benches have plaques dedicating them to parts of the UK. Lifesize British bobbies (policemen) stand to attention beside a red carpet leading past the queen. Actually, make that queens \u2013 because there are two Elizabeths, one for each building. Wooden huts \u2013 which host the annual Christmas market and other special events \u2013 are bedecked with larger-than-life images of the royals: Kate and William, Meghan and Harry, Charles and Camilla, and the late queen with Paddington Bear, all superimposed on classic British landscapes. Oh, and there\u2019s a shrine to Princess Diana in a quieter part of the garden. Every year, members of a German fan club of the late princess gather here to pay their respects. Because that\u2019s the thing about the Little Britain Inn. Its biggest fans are German. This little patch of land in Vettelschloss has become a place where age-old rivals meet and remember what they like about each other. It sounds like a heartwarming tale of two cultures coming together \u2013 but it hasn\u2019t all been plain sailing. In fact, the reason the Little Britain Inn exists is because of a cross-cultural argument. A space to combat Brexit The Inn is the idea of Gary Blackburn, a Brit who moved to Germany in 1985, aged 21, with 50 marks (around $27) in his pocket, a small bag of clothes, and the dream of staying a few months, working as a tree surgeon. Nearly four decades later, Blackburn is still there. His tree surgery practice takes him all over Germany. He has brought up six children in the country and married twice: first to a German woman, and, for the past 22 years, to Monika, who\u2019s originally from Poland. Yet despite his cosmopolitan lifestyle, Blackburn always hankered after his homeland. Hence the collection of UK-themed memorabilia that he started in 2016 when he bought an old UK phone booth. It was in the wake of the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, and Blackburn was partly paying homage to his roots, but also wanting to do his bit to rebuild relations between the UK and the EU. \u201cI could see things were going to change, and people were asking what I thought about Brexit. So I started collecting things. The idea was to make a place where the Brits and the Germans could keep their friendship going,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone loved the queen, Germans still talk about her all the time. So I wanted to keep the German-British friendship, rather than have them turn against us for doing Brexit.\u201d The phone box was just the start. Then came the (first) lifesize model of the queen. Then came more. And more. Two double decker London buses \u2013 one of which is from 1966, the year that England infamously beat Germany in the World Cup soccer final \u2013 became the centerpiece of what he modestly calls \u201ca bit of a collection.\u201d In total, he actually has four buses, two of which are currently under restoration. \u201cI went a bit crazy,\u201d he admits. Initially Blackburn stored it all at his home, on the outskirts of the village. Germans visiting the Rhine area would pop by for a gawp, a photo and a chat. But in 2018 he hit a bump in the road. His newest purchase was a tank, and his neighbors  decided to object to the whole installation. The local authorities agreed. They missed the point, says Blackburn; the tank wasn\u2019t a declaration of war. For starters, it\u2019s a post-war model, he\u2019s keen to point out. \u201cIt\u2019s a monument for freedom and peace \u2013 that people shouldn\u2019t forget how horrible wars are,\u201d he says. The footpath running beside his house leads to land that was the scene of heavy fighting during World War II. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any bad intention. I wanted people to think, not hide things under the carpet.\u201d He certainly did make them think. When he was ordered to shut down his exhibition, it made worldwide headlines \u2013 and he received waves of support from Germans who\u2019d enjoyed seeing his homage to the UK when they came biking and hiking along the Rhine. They thought it was all over\u2026. But they didn\u2019t bargain on Blackburn having a cunning plan. A hotel to house his memorabilia Vettelschloss sits across the boundary of two local authorities. While the one in which Blackburn\u2019s home was situated \u2013 Erpel, in the district of Unkel \u2013 asked him to shutter the site, authorities on the other side of the village \u2013 Vettelschloss itself, under the jurisdiction of Linz \u2013 were making more hospitable noises. Blackburn estimates that he has spent over 500,000 euros ($535,000) on his collection. As well as the buses (one alone was 55,000 euros plus tax), he has a collection of cars including a Rolls-Royce, London taxis, a Mini, phone boxes, postboxes, multiple figures and even a Tardis from \u201cDoctor Who.\u201d \u201cI could have retired but this has been more fun, living my dreams and using my imagination,\u201d he says. Monika calls his collection \u201ccrazy.\u201d \u201cHe goes over the top \u2013 he doesn\u2019t buy just one thing, he buys four or five,\u201d she shrugs. So what do you do when your collection of UK memorabilia worth half a million dollars is shuttered by one half of the village? You move it to the other. In 2020, Blackburn saw a house on the Vettelschloss side of the boundary for sale for 350,000 euros ($375,000) and promptly snapped it up. \u201cI bought it to park the tank and the buses,\u201d he says, simply. But then he had a lightbulb moment. Instead of simply recreating the open-air exhibition space they\u2019d had before, they could open a hotel themed around the UK. Who opens a hotel during a pandemic? A man convinced that Germans will love memorabilia of the British royal family. He was right. The Little Britain Inn opened in September 2020, and was immediately so popular that the following year Blackburn bought the house next door to add more rooms, a restaurant and a pub. Today, the hotel caters to the hikers and cyclists who come for the Rhine Valley, as well as those who, according to Blackburn, come to Vettelschloss purely for the Little Britain Inn. Blackburn\u2019s collection \u2013 including the infamous tank, now painted in the colors of the Union Jack \u2013 is scattered around the two houses and the garden area between them. \u201cGermans love it \u2013 more Germans like England than you can imagine,\u201d he says, noting that their 9.3 rating on Booking.com is higher than that of the hotel nearby where the actual queen of England once stayed. The Little Britain Inn also rates 4.8 out of 5 on Google. \u201cLots of people come for a weekend, as a present,\u201d he says. \u201cThe food\u2019s really good. The sheets are Egyptian cotton, brought over from England. The towels are from Guildford (in the UK) \u2013 we spent 40,000 euros on bedding alone. Some of our best guests have been here eight or 10 times \u2013 it\u2019s like they\u2019re our friends.\u201d Today, the Little Britain Inn is going from strength to strength. Its last Christmas fair \u2013 where they sold traditional Cornish pasties, fish and chips, and beer galore, while a DJ and an Elvis impersonator provided the entertainment \u2013 was bigger than the one in the nearby town of Linz, says Blackburn. For the coronation last year, they put on a party, with guests arriving in Charles and Camilla masks. When Queen Elizabeth died, they stuck to a sober screening of the funeral. Rooms fit for a queen Hotel guests can pick one of the 12 rooms themed by place (like Cornwall, which has a mural of a clifftop scene painted behind the bed) or by person, whether real or fictional \u2013 including James Bond, Mr. Bean, Agatha Christie, Harry Potter and the late queen. All have themed murals behind the bed, in which no attention to detail has been spared \u2013 Blackburn says that when he noticed that some flowers in the Cornish room didn\u2019t look like the flowers that grow on Cornish clifftops, he got the artist back in to change them. Awakening in the morning, guests traipse down past the buses, tank and statues, to a full English breakfast of sausages, bacon, baked beans, toast and more. Everything is top quality \u2013 in fact, says Blackburn, everything is sourced from the UK, apart from the eggs. The tea, the beer, everything is shipped over from the UK \u2013 no wonder some Germans pop in for breakfast alone. They also have gin especially blended from them \u2013 the King Charles one is infused with honey, while the top-of-the-range bottle is called Lillibet (the late queen\u2019s nickname). Morning coffee and tea is served in mugs by chi-chi designer Emma Bridgewater with names of the royals painted on them. Those popping in during the day can try fish and chips, roast dinners, cream teas and more, all made by Monika, who had never attempted British food before opening the inn, and says she learned to make the cooked breakfasts and fish and chips by watching YouTube and Instagram videos. Meals are taken either in the medieval-themed dining room (the Robin Hood murals are recreations of the illustrations of a childhood book Blackburn\u2019s grandmother gave him), in the beer garden, or out the front, on a bench beside the queen or chairs underneath Prince William. Regulars have donated bits and pieces to the collection, from pictures of the royals to books, Harry Potter memorabilia and even a piano. About half his clients are German, he says \u2013 and regulars include local politicians, including the mayor of Vettelschloss. \u201cHe comes here, we drink beer, it\u2019s all fine,\u201d says Blackburn. \u201cThey\u2019re nice people.\u201d The other half are mainly made up of migrants and visitors from English-speaking countries, he says. Then there are others visiting the area for work or pleasure. People coming on business to Birkenstock and John Deere, which have factories nearby, stay at the Inn. On the night CNN was in the building, there were visitors from Argentina. Because despite the kitsch, the rooms are incredibly comfortable. Monika and the couple\u2019s daughters Emily and Alyson run the inn together. Emily, 20, is off to hotel school next to learn how to take things up a notch. Blackburn hopes that when he and Monika retire, the girls can take over the business. Cross-cultural contamination But for Blackburn, the Little Britain Inn isn\u2019t a hotel; it\u2019s a state of mind. And one the Germans share. \u201cThe Germans really respect the royals, and felt closer to the UK than anywhere else in the EU,\u201d he says. Blackburn says he hopes to retire back in the UK one day. He is, after all a fervent royalist. Monika is less so but says, diplomatically, \u201cI think England without the kings and queens wouldn\u2019t be the same.\u201d She generously let her husband name their dogs: Charles and Camilla, a red setter-Australian setter mix and a Altdeutsche Sch\u00e4ferhund (a breed known as an \u201cold German shepherd\u201d), who recently had puppies together. They\u2019re not the only ones with royal names in the family: Alyson\u2019s middle name is Diana, and one of Monika and Gary\u2019s sons is called William. The real Charles, Camilla and William may be around 330 miles northwest, but Blackburn lives in hope that one day he might get a royal knock on the door. \u201cI think they\u2019d really appreciate it \u2013 especially because they\u2019re part German,\u201d he says, opening the door of the gents toilets to reveal King Charles plastered over the toilet door, overlooking the urinals. Perhaps a state visit could be on the cards.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/little-britain-inn-germany-gary-blackburn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_when-your-home-becomes-a-tourist-attraction", "text": "Have you ever looked at a beautiful little mews house in London and thought \u201cit must be so amazing to live there?\u201d If so, you\u2019re not the only one. But for the people who actually do live in those homes, social media photography has changed what it means to live in a picturesque place. Alice Johnston is a longtime resident of Notting Hill, the London neighborhood famous for pastel-painted row houses and for being the setting of the Julia Roberts/Hugh Grant movie of the same name. Johnston,\u00a0a journalist, has complicated feelings about her Instagram-beloved \u2018hood. She lives on Portobello Road, one of the capital\u2019s most famous streets, and has witnessed all kinds of crazy behavior committed in the pursuit of the perfect snapshot. Once, she and a friend were walking his French bulldog when a tourist asked if they could \u201cborrow\u201d the pup for a quick photo op. The friend and the dog consented, the Instagrammer posed with the Frenchie in front of a bright blue door and then handed over five pounds as a thank you. Private lives, public places In that story, everybody had a good time. But there can be a darker side to living inside what some people think is a movie set. \u201cI was once woken up at 6 a.m. on Easter Sunday by French teenagers taking pictures outside,\u201d Johnston says. She shares another anecdote: \u201cOne time I was changing after I got out of the shower and there was this elderly man taking a picture (of my windows) with an iPad.\u201d Although the shutters were closed at the time, she was understandably rattled by the experience. When private homes \u2013 and the people who live in them \u2013 become tourist attractions, clashes can occur. In more rural areas, people can put up fences or other barriers to access, but when these private homes are on public streets in some of the world\u2019s busiest cities, what\u2019s a resident to do? Different communities have taken different approaches. In Hong Kong, a group of five interconnected housing estates nicknamed \u201cthe Monster Building\u201d became a huge selfie spot after it was featured in several Hollywood films, including \u201cTransformers: Age of Extinction.\u201d The mega-building is in Quarry Bay, a relatively quiet neighborhood on the eastern side of Hong Kong island that most travelers skip over. Residents of the working-class community are not able to block the building off due to the fact that there are public businesses on the ground floors. Therefore, some have taken things into their own hands by posting signs asking visitors to be respectful. A sign in English and Chinese erected by building residents reads \u201cThis is a private estate Trespassers are strictly prohibited from all kinds of activities (including but not limited to photographing, gatherings, use of drones and yelling e.t.c.). We shall not take responsibility for property damage and/or personal injury caused by any accident.\u201d However, many visitors ignore the signs or simply think of them as suggestions, and a quick scan of Instagram shows plenty of recent images taken there. Johnston says that a pale-pink house near where she lives has become such a popular photo site that the residents have given up on trying to keep people away. Instead, they\u2019ve put up a donation box asking people to contribute money to charity in exchange for snapping a photo. When your home is a piece of history Chuck Henderson\u2019s grandmother, Della, was a lover of architecture \u2013 so much that she was able to commission a home in California built by the world-renowned American architect\u00a0Frank Lloyd Wright. The Mrs. Clinton Walker House in Carmel-by-the-Sea, nicknamed \u201cthe Cabin on the Rocks,\u201d was completed in 1951 and passed into the hands of Henderson and some of his relatives when Walker died. No one lives in it full time, but the different family members and their guests take turns staying there. Wright fans will come from all over the world to try and get glimpses of some of his masterpieces. While some, like the famous Fallingwater house in Pennsylvania, are year-round attractions, others remain private residences. Many people who own homes featured in architecture textbooks have to add the cost of security measures onto other expenses like utilities and homeowners insurance. \u201cWe put these security cameras in after we had some vandalism about six or seven years ago,\u201d Henderson says. The vandalism in question wasn\u2019t graffiti, though. He explains: \u201cWe have this big wooden remnant of a tree that is placed as the centerpiece of the garden by the original landscape designer. Someone cut a notch from it. It looked clean, like someone used a chainsaw or something. One of our doors \u2013 between the carport and the main house \u2013 has a bunch of nautical cork discs in a rope net and is the counterweight for the door. That has been absconded with a couple of times.\u201d Stlll, though, Henderson and his family have the last laugh on the cork disc thieves \u2013 those weren\u2019t designed by Wright and are of little, if any, value. \u201cWe have people go walking right by the \u2018private property, no trespassing\u2019 sign. We\u2019ve had people dancing in our carport. We get a few people wandering up as a surprise, and as long as they don\u2019t do anything wrong we don\u2019t try to call the police. We\u2019re on a beach surrounded by road and don\u2019t have a lawn, but we had a family of deer.\u201d Coming to a compromise When it comes to living in a much-photographed place, some people try to take the good with the bad. Johnston tries to be sympathetic to travelers coming to her hometown, recalling how she loved taking pictures of historic neighborhoods like the Marais in Paris and Alfama in Lisbon. In fact, she recently found photos of herself as a teenager hanging out at the Notting Hill Carnival, years before she moved to the capital herself. \u201cI love to travel, so I have to be pretty understanding when people travel to where I live, and i feel lucky that it\u2019s cool enough that people want to come where I live.\u201d Henderson and his relatives have come to some compromises in order to let design buffs explore the home while also maintaining their privacy. They occasionally rent it out for photo shoots, such as a campaign by\u00a0eyewear brand Oliver Peoples. In addition, they open the home to the public one day a year to benefit the local Carmel Heritage Society. In 2021, 657 people came bought tickets and toured the property. \u201cFor us it\u2019s a tremendous pleasure to be able to share the house and see so many people happy and excited about it,\u201d says Henderson. \u201cAnd it allows us to be able to tell people when it is open. It gives them an option (to visit) and we don\u2019t have to be the Grinch.\u201d Still, it\u2019s not clear if anyone in the family changed their minds about looking after such a high-profile residence. Henderson and his relatives sold the house in 2023.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/when-your-home-becomes-a-tourist-attraction/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_travel_paris-chefs-immigrants-national-rally", "text": "Located on the famous Rue Bretagne \u2013 known as one of the best bar streets in Paris \u2013 the terrace of Le Pinardier is always busy on summer evenings.  It\u2019s a quintessentially French experience - regulars ordering the wines of the day alongside cheese and charcuterie - but one only made possible by one of the most divisive issues in the country right now: immigration. At Le Pinardier, those food orders from the sunny terrace quickly end up 70 feet away, in the kitchen, in the hands of 24-year-old chef, Sazal Saha. Originally from the city of Kuhlna in Bangladesh, Saha is in his fifth year at Le Pinardier after training in catering for two years at the Joliet-Curie School in northern France. He\u2019s typically the only person working in the kitchen, which means he does everything: buying the produce, preparing ingredients, cooking, washing the dishes and cleaning. \u201cManaging the kitchen is not easy when you\u2019re working alone,\u201d Saha told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s so complicated, sometimes I get tired, but I\u2019m used to it,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cWhen I first moved to France, I didn\u2019t know anything about cheese, but I know almost everything about them now,\u201d he said. One key reason behind Saha\u2019s decision to become a cook in the French capital is because he saw the huge demand from the industry. A job French people don\u2019t want? Across France and especially in Paris, hospitality is one of the industries that is most heavily reliant on immigrant workers. Roughly 25% of the cooks in France are immigrants from outside of the European Union, the then French Labor Minister Olivier Dussopt told Europe 1 radio at the beginning of 2024. Half of the 86,000-plus chefs in the French capital are immigrants, according to data published by the French National Institute of Statistic and Economic Studies in 2022. They\u2019re the main force supporting the gastronomic landscape of the French capital, feeding and delighting tourists from across the globe. \u201cMost of the people working in kitchens [in Paris] are either from Bangladesh or Sri Lanka,\u201d said Florian Mousson, owner of Le Pinardier. Born and raised in a family of generations of restaurant owners in the southern city of Marseille, Mousson believes that his business would not survive without immigrant workers. Yet, in this month\u2019s French parliamentary elections, which enters a second round vote this weekend, anti-immigration sentiment is seen as one of the factors driving the popularity of far-right party Rassemblement National (National Rally). In Paris, kitchen workers are mostly originally from South Asia, like Saha. In Mousson\u2019s hometown Marseille and many places in the south of France, restaurants and bars rely on immigrants from the Comoros, a former French colony in the Indian Ocean. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough job. You work standing up, you work evenings and weekends, you put in long hours, and it\u2019s very hot in the kitchen. Often in Paris, the kitchens are very small, so it\u2019s a very strenuous job,\u201d Mousson said. \u201cThere are fewer and fewer French people who are willing to do this job,\u201d he added. He hired Saha shortly after he opened Le Pinardier in 2019, making contact through a website called Leboncoin, the French version of Craigslist. Mousson says that he\u2019s not only a good cook, but a tough worker and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 a team player. Some might argue that restaurant owners prefer to hire immigrants because they cost less, but for Mousson that is not the case. \u201cI don\u2019t care if my cook is French or a foreigner. But when you put out an ad looking for a chef, for every eight or nine foreign CVs you receive, you get one French CV, so even statistically speaking you\u2019re more likely to hire a foreigner,\u201d he said. Saha earns a good salary due to the long hours he has to work. Mousson says that it\u2019s not low salaries that dictate who works in the kitchen; it\u2019s whether the person has the sticking power for such a demanding position. Mousson\u2019s first chef was French. But she resigned after only three days because she wanted a job where she can solely focus on cooking and not do the rest of the job \u2013 cleaning the kitchen, cleaning dishes and all the rest. \u201cFor a small business like us, we cannot afford to hire multiple people in the kitchen,\u201d Mousson said. \u2018I\u2019m a little worried\u2019 Saha likes Paris. Over the past five years, cooking for Parisians and tourists has allowed him to buy an apartment in a suburb and make a living in the French capital. But now the looming possibility of the far right coming to power is keeping him up at night. \u201cI am a little worried. I believe their decision is not correct,\u201d he said, referring to the immigration policies and rhetoric he saw on TV the weekend before. National Rally won a record 33.15% of the vote, leading the race following the first round of French parliamentary elections on June 30, according to data published by the French Interior Ministry. While it remains to be seen if the party can capture an absolute majority in the French National Assembly, it will almost certainly become the biggest force in the new parliament. Running on a \u201cFrance first\u201d agenda, National Rally is calling for much stricter control on immigration, both legal and illegal. It also wants to give French citizens preferential treatment in the social welfare system. \u201cWe are here, we are not doing bad things, we are working here, we are paying taxes, we are paying everything like all French people,\u201d Saha said. \u201cWhy are they making decisions that are so hard on immigration? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d But this doesn\u2019t stop him from looking forwards to his future life in France, a country that he loves. \u201cI am proud to work in a French restaurant. I like it. I love it,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/travel/paris-chefs-immigrants-national-rally/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_worlds-50-best-restaurants-for-2024", "text": "Any doubts that Spain remains the fine dining center of the world may just have evaporated with the revealing of the World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants for 2024 list. Five eateries from the European nation made the list \u2013 three of them in the top five. The awards\u00a0\u2013 considered the Oscars of global fine dining \u2013 were handed out at a ceremony at the Wynn in Las Vegas on Wednesday evening, with Barcelona\u2019s Disfrutar walking away with the top prize. Ranked number two last year, it\u2019s owned and run by chefs Oriol Castro, Eduard Xatruch and Mateu Casanas. The fact that this trio met while working at the legendary El Bulli should provide a few clues as to what diners can expect \u2013 imaginative and playful dishes executed with technical mastery, such as the caviar-filled Panchino doughnut, the frozen gazpacho sandwich and squab with kombu spaghetti, almond and grape. Coming in at number two was Asador Etxebarri of Atxondo, not far from the Spanish port city of Bilbao. Under the leadership of chef Victor Arguinzoniz, it\u2019s famed for offering unbeatable barbecue that lets the quality of the ingredients shine, such as a red Palam\u00f3s prawn that\u2019s simply grilled and served on its own. But you can never count Paris out.\u00a0The French capital\u2019s Table by Bruno Verjus\u00a0squeezed into third place, while yet another restaurant from Spain \u2013 Madrid\u2019s Diverxo \u2013 took the fourth spot. Coming in at fifth was Lima\u2019s Maido, one of three restaurants from the city to make the list, giving the Peruvian capital\u2019s reputation as South America\u2019s premier dining destination yet another boost. Mexico was the big winner in North America, earning three restaurants on the list, led by Mexico City eatery Quintonil, which came in seventh. The rest of the list Securing five restaurants on the list was enough to make Spain the biggest winner of the night in Vegas. In terms of cities, Paris and Bangkok tied for first, each with four restaurants on the list. Gaggan Anand, at number nine, was the Thai capital\u2019s top entry. As for the event\u2019s host country, the US had two restaurants on this year\u2019s 50 Best list. New York City\u2019s Atomix came in 6th this year, rising two spots since last year. SingleThread, in the town of Healdsburg in California\u2019s Sonoma Valley, landed in 46th place. Three restaurants from Tokyo were awarded, with eatery S\u00e9zanne\u00a0(voted Asia\u2019s best restaurant in 2024) ranking the highest in the Japanese capital, at 15. Hong Kong saw two of its restaurants hit the list, with both making impressive moves. Wing was the city\u2019s highest new entry on the entire list, at 20, while The Chairman was the highest climber, moving from last year\u2019s 50th spot into number 26. The list is compiled based on the votes of the\u00a0The World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants Academy, which is made up of\u00a0 1,080 international restaurant industry experts including food writers and chefs, in 27 regions around the world. Restaurants can only win the top prize once, after which they\u2019re entered into a separate \u201cBest of the Best\u201d program. Members of that elite group include Geranium and Noma in Copenhagen, as well as New York\u2019s Eleven Madison Park, The Fat Duck near London, Osteria Francescana in Modena, Italy, and Mirazur in Menton, France. Last year\u2019s winner, Central of Lima, Peru, now joins them on that list. The world\u2019s 50 best restaurants 2024 1. Disfrutar\u00a0(Barcelona, Spain) 2.

{"id": "travel_termessos-turkey-hidden-ancient-mountaintop-city", "text": "Alexander the Great tried to conquer Termessos but failed. Today, the incredible deserted ruins of this once-powerful city, perched like a fortified eagle\u2019s nest high in the mountains of southwestern Turkey, can be conquered by anyone willing to make the hike up here. But few people ever do. Termessos stands empty. A spectacular archeological jewel, preserved in isolation, seen only by a few handfuls of people who make the trip from the beach resorts of nearby tourism hot spot Antalya. That\u2019s a shame for those who miss out. For those who do get to explore, it\u2019s a major bonus. They get to wander around one of Turkey\u2019s most impressive ancient cities all by themselves. It\u2019s a place of incredible atmosphere: history and landscape; views and silence; nature and destruction \u2013 all combining to create one of the Mediterranean\u2019s great unsung archaeological wonders. Here, slowly being swallowed by vegetation and worn down by time, are gigantic mausoleums, vast underground cisterns, temples, imposing city walls and a breathtaking theater perched, like Machu Picchu, on a hilltop that offers views stretching for miles all around. Despite its emptiness, Termessos is easy to reach. It only takes around 45 minutes to drive from Antalya\u2019s traffic-snarled downtown to the gates of Mount G\u00fcll\u00fck-Termessos National Park \u2013 a protected wildlife haven that surrounds the ruins. After paying a three-euro (about $3) gate fee at the park\u2019s entrance, visitors then face another 10-minute ride further into the pine and gorse-clad hills along a switchback road that reaches about 1,000 meters above sea level. Eventually the road emerges into what seems like an uninteresting parking lot with a public restroom. This was, in fact, at one time a giant agora, or marketplace for the city, which in its heyday 2,000 years ago would\u2019ve been bustling with traders and citizens. It\u2019s here where the Termessos adventure begins. And it begins with death. Tomb raiders Hidden by vegetation at one end of the agora are the stone-strewn remains of what was clearly once a grand street leading away along the hillside. Instead of houses or shops, this was lined with the tombs of Termessos\u2019 rich and mighty. Ancient sarcophagi carved with clues to who they once contained, like shields and spears for warriors, lie scattered. Some are small, others huge \u2013 offering clues to levels of wealth or power. Some are unfinished, their huge pedestals hinting at what would\u2019ve been. All of them have been broken into by raiders over the centuries, their walls smashed or lids prised off despite once being locked shut with metal clasps. Tree roots and ivy creepers have also snaked through the stonework. \u201cThe thieves working here were very good at their jobs,\u201d says \u00d6nder U\u011fuz, an Antalya-based art teacher and licensed guide who offers tours of Termessos, which he\u2019s been captivated by since first coming here as a student in 1996 (\u201cIt was love at first sight!\u201d). Reaching the heart of the ancient city involves an uphill hike along a leafy pathway that\u2019s a little rough and steep in places. Visitors here need to be equipped with sturdy footwear and OK with mildly strenuous hiking on tricky terrain. In summer, it\u2019s best to visit early before temperatures start to climb, and bring water. Soon the lower city walls loom into view \u2013 a first hint at how well-defended Termessos was when it was built perhaps around the fourth or fifth century BCE, long before the Romans showed up with the engineering skills that would transform the known world. Which raises the question: how did the people of Termessos do it? U\u011fuz laughs off the suggestion of any mystery here. We\u2019re too caught up in the achievements of our technological age to appreciate even the basic abilities of our distant ancestors, in his opinion. \u201cYou and I, we\u2019re nothing without our computers and social media accounts,\u201d he says (shortly after taking a snap for his own Instagram feed). \u201cTake those away and we are helpless. Not these people. They worked with stone for centuries. They had nothing else. Building things like this was what they knew how to do.\u201d The people of Termessos were known as Solyms, descendants of Luwians, an ancient civilization that was spread across what is now Turkey, but largely overlooked by archaeological scholars until the past few decades. To this day, little is known about the Solyms or when they constructed their city. But they clearly knew what they were doing. Their choice of location showed a genius for strategic thinking. Not only was it on a major trade route, enabling it to grow wealthy on goods and payments from people heading to and from the Mediterranean, its altitude and commanding views made it easy to defend. Which is why when Alexander the Great showed up around 333 BCE \u2013 when Termessos made its first real appearance in the history books \u2013 he was apparently unable to invade or blockade the city into surrender, despite multiple attempts. He reputedly called the city an \u201ceagle\u2019s nest.\u201d Later, the Romans had more success in controlling the city. Not through force, says U\u011fuz, but through more insidious means, like offering autonomy under Roman \u201cprotection.\u201d \u201cThe Romans were like the mafia,\u201d he suggests. Fight school Climbing higher up the hillside on a rocky path sprouting with fragrant wild sage, there\u2019s more evidence of how sophisticated life in Termessos would\u2019ve been. To the left, there\u2019s the marble ruins of the city\u2019s gymnasium, a kind of college campus for trainee soldiers, complete with bathhouse and refectory. Some of the main building is still intact, with indications that impressive arches once ran across its front wall. Inside were two floors, plus a subterranean vault for storage. In front is the palaestra, an area that would\u2019ve been used for wrestling and combat training and which today is littered with pieces of the gymnasium\u2019s terracotta roof tiles. It is, of course, mostly derelict. Termessos was believed to have been destroyed by an earthquake the exact date of which is not known, but possibly the 4th or 5th century. What remains is not the work of archeological reconstruction. It\u2019s the genuine state the building has been left in for the past 1,600 years. Here, the silence and emptiness of the place allow the imagination to wander \u2013 bringing those warriors back to life and allowing visualization of their mock battles in a place that has changed so little over time. Further up, the upper city walls give commanding views of the forest below and offer a good vantage point over anyone trying to sneak up for an invasion. Beyond them is more evidence of civilization. There are the remains of a covered water drainage system. And for a city that had few water sources, they are one of its most impressive assets \u2013 gigantic multi-chambered underground cisterns carved by hand into solid rock and lined with plaster. Capable of holding up to 1,500 tons of water, these cavernous containers would\u2019ve been vital to the survival of a city that had few natural sources of H2O \u2013 especially when Alexander the Great was mounting blockades. Today, they\u2019re filled with broken columns and other rubble, likely dumped there when the city was abandoned. There\u2019s speculation water shortages could\u2019ve been behind a decision to finally relocate the city elsewhere. Luxury shops Nearby, there\u2019s the imposing outer wall of the bouleuterion or assembly house that would\u2019ve been the city\u2019s seat of power, another central agora dating back to pre-Roman times and the ruins of a colonnaded street that once housed the city\u2019s most exclusive shops. \u201cThis is the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es of Termessos,\u201d says U\u011fuz. Like the Parisian upscale retail boulevard, this would\u2019ve been where the wealthy spent their cash, he explains. The finest olive oils, cloths, leather goods and items imported from all around the Mediterranean would\u2019ve been on sale here. These are all sideshows to the city\u2019s showstopper attraction: the theater After a last scramble over huge slabs of marble, the view opens up onto an epic panorama of the large performance space, perched on the city\u2019s highest point. The setting is breathtaking, with mountain ravines cascading away on either side. The sheer drop behind the theater\u2019s upper walls is dizzying. It\u2019s a reminder to be careful when exploring ruins that haven\u2019t been fenced off for safety. With room for about 4,000 people, the semi-circle of stone terraces faces the ruins of what would\u2019ve been a stage. The theater probably predated the arrival of the Romans, but was later updated along Roman lines. In Termessos, the location is particularly significant, as it sits opposite a mountain that was once sacred to the city\u2019s inhabitants. It\u2019s easy to see why this was such a hallowed spot, with views that, on haze-free days, stretch as far as the port of Antalya. And again, it\u2019s a place to sit and imagine what life was like nearly 2,000 years ago, when such theaters would\u2019ve been used by the Romans as, according to U\u011fuz, a propaganda tool - a soft force to keep their empire in check. As history lessons go, this is pretty spectacular. U\u011fuz (who can be contacted via email: onder.uguz@gmail.com) says he never tires of exploring Termessos. He also offers tours of other more popular archaeological sites in the area, but the tranquility and beauty of this hidden ancient wonder draw him back time and again. He particularly loves soaking in the vistas from the city\u2019s upper walls. \u201cUsually, I\u2019m sitting there with my wife, under a juniper tree in springtime, a beautiful blue sky with this great scenery,\u201d he says, adding that year-round, the solitude offered by Termessos is also an attraction. \u201cFor me it\u2019s perfect. Just you and nature; little squirrels and archaeology. The only thing missing is a cold beer.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/termessos-turkey-hidden-ancient-mountaintop-city/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_orfali-bros-bistro-dubai-best-restaurant-hnk-spc-intl", "text": "When Mohamad Orfali was a child, his favorite meal was breakfast. At his family home in Aleppo, Syria, his grandfather would prepare \u201cTreet Bel Laban\u201d \u2014 an omelet with meatballs, served on top of garlic yogurt, and eaten with warm bread. \u201cI have so many memories of food,\u201d says Orfali, \u201cbut I think this is the best of the best.\u201d Food and family have always been a package deal for Orfali \u2014 now more than ever, as he runs a restaurant with his two younger brothers, the eponymous Orfali Bros Bistro in Dubai. Opened in 2021, their menu is a love letter to their Syrian roots and the culinary traditions the brothers grew up with, fused with contemporary Arabic and Mediterranean flavors. A former TV chef, Mohamad is the chef de cuisine and charismatic host, while his brothers, Wassim and Omar, both pastry chefs, are behind the restaurant\u2019s distinctive desserts. \u201cWe speak food. We love food, and we love people who love food,\u201d says Orfali. And it\u2019s not just the brothers that love their food,\u00a0but award bodies, too. The restaurant just picked up its first Michelin star this month, and earlier this year, the bistro was awarded \u201cbest restaurant\u201d in the Middle East and North Africa, according to the 50 Best list. \u201cWe\u2019re very honored to get this accolade,\u201d says Orfali on their most recent win. The restaurant\u2019s debut on the 50 Best list back in 2022, just 10 months after opening, helped put the restaurant \u201con the map\u201d with guests traveling from around the world to sample the brothers\u2019 unusual cuisine, he adds. \u201cNow, Orfali Bros is like a destination for people who love food,\u201d says Orfali, adding, \u201cMy award is when I see people come back one, two, three, four times.\u201d A multicultural menu Orfali left Syria in 2006, relocating to Dubai a year later, and his brothers followed. \u201cWe started the business as three brothers, but my family is very big now \u2014 we\u2019re 53 people,\u201d he says, explaining that he considers his restaurant staff to be his extended family. \u201cDifferent nationalities, different colors, different languages, different accents. And that is what I love. This is the beauty of Orfali Bros. This is how we represent the community, this is how we represent Dubai.\u201d The multiculturalism in Orfali\u2019s restaurant is reflected across the country: the UAE is home to 200 nationalities, and the population is more than 90% non-Emirati. While the Orfali Bros Bistro is grounded in Syrian influences, it offers something Orfali calls \u201cDubai Cuisine\u201d \u2014 not Emirati food, but an adjustment of global culinary traditions for the international palette, a way of allowing people from hundreds of different backgrounds and tastes to enjoy a meal together. He\u2019s quick to add that the menu is not \u201cinternational cuisine,\u201d though, which often \u201ckills the identity\u201d of its dishes, Orfali says. Many of the menu ideas at Orfali Bros stem from his childhood experiences or family cooking, using traditional ingredients but \u201crebuilt it in a different way,\u201d says Orfali. For example, one of the restaurant\u2019s signature dishes, playfully named \u201cGuess What?\u201d combines a Lebanese Fattoush salad, Greek salad and gazpacho (a cold Spanish soup) onto one plate. Or, the \u201cshish barak a la gyoza\u201d presents an Asian twist on the traditional Levantine meat dumpling, drizzled with sujuk oil, inspired by spicy Sichuan flavors. \u201cWe love to surprise people \u2014 for me, surprises create memories,\u201d says Orfali. Orfali and his two younger brothers lived, worked and studied in multiple countries before settling in Dubai, and their dishes communicate this multiculturalism: a nostalgia for home, yet the joy of embracing new experiences. \u201cI believe that food doesn\u2019t belong to a territory or map, it belongs to human beings. There are so many ingredients that travel the world because they\u2019ve been taken from one area to another,\u201d he says. \u201cOrfali Bros for us is a platform to explore something new.\u201d A \u201cflourishing\u201d food scene Dubai\u2019s restaurant scene has, until recently, been dominated by celebrity chefs and international franchises. But now, homegrown, independent restaurants are \u201cflourishing,\u201d says Samantha Wood, founder of UAE restaurant review website FooDiva and a Dubai resident for 25 years. Chef-led concepts like the Orfali Bros Bistro exemplify this: \u201cMohamad (Orfali) is very hands-on, typically on the pass or engaging in story-telling,\u201d she says, adding that the \u201ctiny neighborhood gem\u201d offers \u201cinnovative yet flavorsome cooking.\u201d There\u2019s a growing locavore movement in Dubai \u2014 sparked by the Covid-19 pandemic, which disrupted global trade \u2014 that emphasizes produce and ingredients sourced in the \ufeffemirate or UAE, which many of the independent diners have incorporated into their menus, says Wood. For her, \u201cDubai Cuisine\u201d conjures an idea of a \u201cmulticultural melting pot of every cuisine under the sun\u201d \u2014 although she says that Orfali Bros Bistro differentiates itself from typical fusion cuisine \u201cby showcasing cooking influences from Syria and our regional neighbors in a modern manner, and where possible, with local ingredients.\u201d And Orfali Bros isn\u2019t alone in pushing the boundaries of fusion food: Jun\u2019s and Chez Wam also \u201ccelebrate an innovative medley of cultures and cuisines,\u201d Wood adds. For Orfali, the quirky combination of ingredients, or unusual presentation, makes the storytelling element of his food all the more important. \u201cIf guests don\u2019t understand our story, then they look at the plate from a different perspective,\u201d he says. \u201cThe food is a journey \u2014 it\u2019s my journey, my brothers\u2019 journey, and the team\u2019s journey.\u201d The success of Orfali Bros Bistro has inspired the trio to embark on a second project called\u00a0\u201cThree Bros,\u201d a burger joint next door to their current restaurant. Here, diners will be able to order the bistro\u2019s signature \u201cOB cheeseburger\u201d \u2014\u00a0a wagyu beef patty on a Hokkaido bun with secret sauce, cheddar cheese, and caramelized onion \u2014 along with pide, a Turkish flatbread stuffed with fillings, which will be removed from the menu at Orfali Bros and replaced with more innovative, unusual, and equally delicious dishes, he says. But regardless of whether the brothers are serving up burgers or deconstructing their culinary heritage, family is the common thread that runs through their cooking. \u201cWe build a relationship between us and the guests, and we make it family,\u201d Orfali says. \u201cIt\u2019s not about running a family business \u2014 the people that come to us, they feel at home, they feel like family.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/orfali-bros-bistro-dubai-best-restaurant-hnk-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "travel"}}

Evacuation orders for\u00a0Denali National Park and Preserve also were being lifted after being issued July 1 as crews battled the Riley Fire, park officials said.  The park, which had been closed for about a week, will reopen to the public at 4:30 a.m. local time Wednesday, the National Park Service said in a news release. The wildfire, which was first reported June 30, had burned 432 acres and was 96% contained as of Tuesday, park officials said. Firefighters were using aerial bucket drops to cool remaining hot spots, according to the park service. More than 600,000 people visit the park every year, with most visiting in the summer, according to the National Park Service. The fire is extremely rare for that area because an active fire hadn\u2019t been there for 100 years, park officials told CNN. The blaze ignited as the nation grappled with extreme heat\u00a0\u2013 the deadliest form of weather globally and\u00a0one that makes wildfires more likely and destructive. The cause of the fire is unknown, and a fire investigator will investigate, park officials said. The National Park Service said it is requesting information from anyone who may have witnessed the initial stages of the Riley Fire on June 30. The Riley Fire was one of 39 large wildfires burning across Alaska on Tuesday, spanning more 460,000 acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. The Alaska wildfire season typically begins in late May and ends in late July, according to the National Park Service. On average,\u00a01 million acres burn statewide\u00a0every year, the park service says. CNN\u2019s Amanda Musa contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_07_11_travel_south-korea-overtourism-bukchon-hanok-village-intl-hnk", "text": "As the issue of overtourism sweeps cities and countries around the world, authorities in South Korea have announced stricter controls and measures to protect a historic traditional village district in downtown Seoul from throngs of tourists, who have flooded its streets and caused friction with local residents over the years. Known for its picturesque and well-preserved traditional Korean houses called \u201chanok,\u201d Bukchon Hanok Village is one of Seoul\u2019s most popular tourist hot spots \u2013 attracting thousands of visitors every day. But tourists greatly outnumber residents and complaints about noise, littering and privacy issues in the vicinity have escalated over the years. Located in the Jongno district in downtown Seoul, Bukchon sits near other cultural landmarks like the Jongmyo royal ancestral\u00a0shrine and the grand Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung palaces. In a bid to ease tensions and control crowds, district officials will start to restrict tourist access to the popular village from as early as October this year. It will be designated the country\u2019s first-ever \u201cspecial management area\u201d under South Korea\u2019s Tourism Promotion Act. Strict curfews for non-residents will be reinforced daily between 5 p.m. to 10 a.m. Chartered buses carrying tourists will be restricted in several sections. The aim is to reduce traffic and make Bukchon \u201cfoot-centered,\u201d officials said. Three color-coded zones \u2013 red, orange and yellow \u2013 will also be designated to allow local authorities to control and monitor crowds in the most densely populated areas. Fines will also be imposed on violators, officials said. Following public complaints, signs in four languages warning tourists about noise levels were installed in 2018. The area once served as residential quarters for high-ranking authorities and nobility during the era of the Joseon kings, who ruled Korea from the 1300s until 1910. Today, the area is home to around 6,000 residents as well as businesses like inns, craft stores and cafes \u2013 with several prominent photo spots. However, some of those living and working in the area have dismissed the new measures as being \u201cempty talk.\u201d Cafe owner Lee Youn-hee told CNN that tourists usually leave after sunset anyway, as they\u2019re mostly there to take photos. \u201cIn the winter, visitors are gone by 5 p.m. and during summer maybe by 6 p.m. because the days are longer,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThis won\u2019t make a big difference.\u201d A growing global problem But Seoul isn\u2019t alone. Many global cities are struggling to find a balance between much-needed tourism revenue and maintaining their appeal to residents. Tourists visiting Barcelona this week were sprayed with water by protesters marching through popular areas to demonstrate against mass tourism in the city. Italy\u2019s lagoon city of Venice introduced a\u00a0trial fee\u00a0in April to limit the number of day trippers. Overtourism has long been a problem in Japan, with the situation deteriorating rapidly since the country reopened post-pandemic. The slopes of Mount Fuji have seen increasing human traffic jams, foothills littered with garbage as well as bad tourist behavior. Out-of-control tourists have been especially problematic in Kyoto, one of Japan\u2019s most popular tourist cities, famed for its iconic Gion geisha district. Reports of \u201cgeisha paparazzi\u201d fueled public anger and have prompted city officials to take action. Back in Seoul, about 6.6 million domestic and overseas tourists are believed to have visited Bukchon in 2023, according to government data. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that tourists be respectful to those living here,\u201d Sindere Schoultz, a tourist from Sweden, told CNN. \u201cWe want to come here and have a good time but we don\u2019t want to step on somebody\u2019s toes and be disrespectful.\u201d Another Swedish tourist, Emma H\u00e4gg, said she understood the reasons behind the ban. \u201cI don\u2019t mind it,\u201d she said. \u201cI completely understand why and it\u2019s good that they still want us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/travel/south-korea-overtourism-bukchon-hanok-village-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "2022_07_03_travel_drowning-water-safety-tips-wellness", "text": "On Good Friday 2017, Wyatt Werneth got a call from his wife, who had gone grocery shopping with their daughter: The car\u2019s broken down. Please rescue us. Werneth hopped in his vehicle to assist, driving by Patrick Space Force Base near Cape Canaveral, Florida. From the A1A highway, Werneth said you can see the ocean. What he saw next was a twist of fate that led to a much more urgent kind of rescue. \u201cI could see someone waving in traffic as I was going by. \u2026 I pulled in to see what was going on; I had the immediate instinct that something was happening in the water,\u201d Werneth recalled to CNN Travel. \u201cWhen I came over the berm, I did not realize what I was getting into. There were multiple people in the water.\u201d And they were in trouble. Very serious trouble. Rip current kind of trouble. The scene would send chills of dread down anyone\u2019s spine \u2014 but at least Werneth was prepared. He is an experienced lifeguard instructor and had water rescue equipment with him.  But with at least five people struggling in a vicious Atlantic rip current, how would he possibly save them all? The statistics are grim Rip currents could be a major hazard along much of the US Gulf Coast this weekend because of Hurricane Beryl. And with temperatures so high, the desire to take a dip in the water will be strong. Be cautious, check local conditions and see below for more details about what to do if you\u2019re caught in one. Whether it\u2019s from these potentially dangerous currents, seemingly placid lakes or swimming pools, the drowning statistics from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are shocking. In the CDC\u2019s most recently updated numbers, more than 4,000 fatal unintentional drownings happen every year in the United States (including boating incidents). That is an average of 11 drowning deaths per day. July tends to be the peak month for deaths. From 2018 to 2021, the states with the most drowning deaths per 100,000 people were the following: 1. Alaska2. Hawaii3. Montana4. Louisiana5. Florida Your odds of drowning are much, much higher than being attacked by a shark or an alligator. World drowning statistics are even more shocking. There are an estimated 236,000 annual drowning deaths worldwide, according to the UN\u2019s World Health Organization. That comes out to an average of 647 people per day. And then there are the even more numerous nonfatal drownings. The CDC says people who survive a drowning incident have a range of outcomes: \u201cFrom no injuries to very serious injuries or permanent disability.\u201d The tragedy is many of these deaths and injuries are preventable, experts say. What can you do to enjoy the water \u2014 be it ocean, river, lake or swimming pool \u2014 safely and not join the ranks of drowning deaths? Turns out, a lot. Who is most at risk? Knowing who is likely to drown is critical. At-risk groups need the most attention. In the United States, those include the following: \u2022 The youngest people: Children 1 to 4 have the highest drowning rates, the CDC says, mostly in swimming pools. \u2022 Males: They account for nearly 80% of fatal drownings in the United States. More risk-taking behaviors and alcohol use are cited as reasons. Across the world, WHO reports males have twice the fatal drowning rate of females. \u2022 People with seizure disorders: People with conditions such as epilepsy are at a higher risk for drowning, and that can happen in a bathtub. Drowning prevention tips The CDC emphasizes the importance of learning basic water safety skills, saying formal lessons can reduce the risk of drowning.  However, \u201cchildren who have had swimming lessons still need close and constant supervision when in or around water,\u201d the agency notes. Don\u2019t get distracted by TV, books or the phone when watching children in the water.  If you\u2019re drinking alcoholic beverages, stay out of the water and don\u2019t go boating. Impaired judgment and slow reactions can lead to tragedy. People in boats and weaker swimmers should wear life jackets, especially in open water. And keep an eye on the weather. Exit if there\u2019s a thunderstorm or heavy rains. Know the water environments Understand the waters you\u2019re about to enter. Different bodies of water carry different types of dangers: OCEAN RIP CURRENTS Rip currents flow away from shore. They often form at breaks in sandbars and close to piers and rock groins.  Look for signs of a rip current before entering, says the United States Lifesaving Association. That can be \u201ca narrow gap of darker, seemingly calmer water between areas of breaking waves and whitewater,\u201d a difference in water color or \u201ca line of foam, seaweed or debris moving seaward.\u201d Here\u2019s what to do you\u2019re caught in one: \u2022 Stay calm. Rip currents don\u2019t pull you underwater but do sweep you farther from shore. \u2022 Don\u2019t swim against the current. Try to escape by \u201cswimming out of the current in a direction following the shoreline,\u201d the USLA says. You may be able to escape by floating or treading water and ride the current out.  \u2022 If you\u2019re in trouble, yell and wave for help. If you\u2019re not trained, don\u2019t try to rescue people yourself. Seek a lifeguard, call 911 or throw a flotation device their way. Direct the person to swim parallel to the shoreline to escape. OTHER OCEAN TIPS The National Weather Service warns swimmers to watch out for \u201cshorebreak\u201d waves. They crash directly onto the sand and can batter and disorient swimmers. \u201cWhen in doubt, don\u2019t go out,\u201d said Wyatt Werneth, who is also the public service spokesperson for the American Lifeguard Association. Swim Guide advises people to swim in the hour before or the hour after low tide or high tide when waters are generally calmer. (But conditions can vary beach to beach). RIVERS Tubing and other activities are popular in rivers. But swift currents and obstacles below the surface or debris can be hazardous.  Werneth said to research the river before you enter. LAKES AND PONDS The placid waters of lakes and ponds can lull waders and swimmers into a false sense of security. Sharp, sudden dropoffs and debris under the water can startle or entangle people, Werneth said, leading to panic and drowning. He said go in with a swim buddy. Dive only in designated areas. The USLA says enter unknown waters feet first to avoid striking your head. Swimmers shouldn\u2019t stray into areas where personal watercraft and boats are speeding by. SWIMMING POOLS The National Drowing Prevention Alliance has this advice for pool owners: \u201cfour-sided fencing with self-closing self-latching gates, door and window alarms, and safety covers can help make sure kids don\u2019t get to the water unsupervised.\u201d And even if your children know how to swim, adults should still maintain a careful watch. Keep flotation devices on hand. BOATING The National Park Service\u2019s \u201cOperation Dry Water\u201d reminds people that all vessels must carry personal flotation devices. National lifeguard shortage Werneth, who is also a spokesman for the American Lifeguard Association, has warned of an ongoing lifeguard shortage in the United States for years now. A June 15, 2024, news release from the ALA called the shortage in Florida \u201cdisturbing.\u201d Werneth said the group\u2019s message has always been \u201cswim in front of a lifeguard.\u201d But he said the reality of the shortage is prompting a new one: \u201cLearn to swim, America.\u201d \u201cWe want people to self-lifeguard. Assign someone in your family to be a water watcher. Have that person learn CPR.\u201d And if someone can\u2019t swim and still wants to wade, \u201cput a life jacket on them. That\u2019s going to make a difference.\u201d Werneth said that if you plan on going to a destination that features water activities, go online first to find out the lifeguard situation and adapt your plans as needed. Some pools, lakes and beaches might not even be open.  Operation Rescue Back in 2017 at that Florida beach, Werneth\u2019s task was daunting. But he had a cool head, decades of experience \u2014 and fortunately, a second experienced helper on hand whom he later learned was from the Air Force. \u201cHe was single-handedly pulling people out before I even got there. \u2026 That Air Force guy was kind of coming back with one. I saw that he had one that was kind of going unconscious, and I immediately jumped in the water, swam out, grabbed the unconscious person and got him out.\u201d Werneth guesses that they were about 50 yards out, and he recalls they ended up pulling five male teens out of the water. They weren\u2019t even in swimming attire, Werneth said, leading him to think it was a spur-of-the-moment decision to enter the ocean. Would the group have died without the rescue, which left him exhausted? \u201cI assure you they all would have. \u2026 These people were going in to help each other, and it caused a chain reaction. Do not go into the water to assist anyone without a flotation device,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was perfect timing that I showed up and happened to be there to help those guys.\u201d All because the family car had broken down. But not everyone can rely on luck. In the end, you need \u201cwater confidence,\u201d gained by experience and respect for the water. \u201cThe fear is what generates the panic which generates the drowning.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/07/03/travel/drowning-water-safety-tips-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_article_bear-encounters-prevent-attacks-wellness", "text": "You\u2019re out for a hike, reveling in glorious nature. Suddenly, you spot a bear. And the bear has spotted you, too. Would you know what to do next? Beth Pratt sure would. She was once on the Old Gardiner Road Trail in Yellowstone National Park, enjoying her run in wild nature. Her reverie came to an end when she came upon a grizzly bear eating flowers.  \u201cI stopped. It stood on its hind legs and looked at me. I knew that wasn\u2019t a threatening gesture,\u201d she told CNN Travel. \u201cI\u2019m not kidding, it waved its paw at me as if to say, \u2018just go on your way,\u2019 and went back to eating.\u201d \u201cAnd I walked slowly away and put some distance between us, and the encounter ended fine.\u201d When it comes to dealing with bears, Pratt does have a thing or two on almost all the rest of us, though. She is the California regional executive director for the National Wildlife Federation, a job she\u2019s had for more than 10 years. She worked in Yellowstone for several years \u2013 and once saw nine grizzlies in one day there.    Finally, she lives on the border of Yosemite National Park, and bears will pass through her yard, including this one seen in the footage above in late September 2021. You can hear the enthusiasm in Pratt\u2019s voice as she shares her bear bona fides and advice to make sure bear/human encounters are delightful, not dangerous. \u201cA wild bear is a beautiful sight to see. It\u2019s incredible to see them in the wild. I never had a bad experience with bears. What I try to get people to feel is respect, not fear, for bears. The animal usually wants to avoid the encounters.\u201d  Bears in the news   Bear attacks are rare, Pratt and US National Park Service websites point out, but they do happen:  \u2022 A disable veteran survived an attack from a mother grizzly at Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming in May 2024. \u201cIt was the most violent thing I have ever experienced.\u201d \u2022 A hunter suffered serious injuries in a grizzly bear attack in British Columbia in May 2024. \u2022 Bear attacks are on the increase in Japan. \u2022 A man lost part of his jaw in a grizzly bear attack in Montana in September 2023. \u2022 Two people died in a suspected grizzly bear attack in Canada\u2019s Banff National Park in late September 2023. \u2022 Two collegiate wrestlers were mauled by a grizzly bear near Cody, Wyoming, in October 2022; they had serious injuries but survived. They illustrate the point that rare doesn\u2019t equal never. Feasts for beasts  While it pays to be diligent at any time, autumn is a particularly good season to bone up on bear facts and safety when many bears are in a phase known as hyperphagia, Pratt said. \u201cIt\u2019s a period in the fall where bears are eating anything and everything to fatten up for hibernation.\u201d  She noted mountain lions are comparatively picky eaters. Not bears.   \u201cThey eat everything: Ants. Roadkill. Flowers. Nuts. And unfortunately, human food that\u2019s not secured. Our food is very attractive to them; it\u2019s easy calories.\u201d   Combine that with the fact that some national and state parks have become very popular and crowded, and you have a recipe for potential trouble. \u201cIf more people are using public lands and more people are in the mix, there\u2019s more potential for encounters and conflict. It does concern me a little bit,\u201d Pratt said. The key is being prepared \u2013 and that\u2019s where Pratt and others in the know come in. First rule of \u2018bear fight club\u2019: Don\u2019t fight The best strategy is to never get in harm\u2019s way by enticing or provoking a wild bear. Trying to give a bear food or approaching cute cubs are particularly terrible ways to start an encounter. That\u2019s just looking for trouble. The US National Park Service site points out each bear and each encounter is different, but there are general guidelines useful in most situations. First of all, keep your distance if you happen upon a bear. Don\u2019t approach it, and give it plenty of room to walk away from you. Yellowstone tells you to stay at least 100 yards (300 feet or 91 meters) away; Shenandoah National Park in Virginia suggests 200 feet (61 meters) for its black bears. You can run afoul of the law as well as the bears if you get too close and end up paying a fine.   Other tips: \u2022 Talk calmly to yourself in low tones to identify yourself as human. \u2022 Walk with a group (we\u2019re smellier and noisier in packs) and stay on designated trails. \u2022 If you have a small child or dog, pick it up. \u2022 Don\u2019t put yourself between cubs and their mother. \u2022  Avoid direct eye contact and move away slowly, sideways if possible. Pratt said don\u2019t be alarmed if a bear stands on its hind legs; it\u2019s not considered an aggressive move. Almost all encounters are peaceful, Pratt said. Many times, people never knew they were even close to a bear, as in this YouTube video that shows two people emerging from a basement oblivious to a nearby bear.  What if a bear starts coming at you anyway?  If a bear starts making assertive moves in your direction, you have important decisions to make \u2013 and fast. First thing is: Stand your ground with bears. With either grizzlies (a subspecies of brown bears) or black bears, \u201cplease don\u2019t run. Bears can outrun anybody,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cDon\u2019t climb a tree either. They can also climb trees better than you.\u201d  New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Division of Fish and Wildlife (where the black bear population is growing) also has some tips: \u2022 Make loud noises by yelling, banging pots and pans or using an airhorn to scare bears away. \u2022 Make yourself look as large as possible by waving your arms.  \u2022 If you\u2019re with other people, stay together. Pratt said you can usually intimidate or bluff your way out of sticky bear situations, depending on the bear species and the situation.  But what if a bear is about to attack? You\u2019re now in the rarest of situations \u2013 you\u2019ve attracted a bear\u2019s attention. It didn\u2019t move off. It\u2019s started coming at you aggressively and fast. You think you\u2019re about to be attacked. What\u2019s next? One very crucial thing is to make a quick ID of the kind of bear, because your strategy is going to be different depending on the type of bear.  If it\u2019s a black bear, the NPS and Pratt have a clear message: Do not run. Do not play dead. \u201cYou want to stand your ground with black bears. Look as intimidating as possible,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cThrow things not at it but near it. Make that black bear intimidated by you. Let it know you are a big person. Pick something up; yell at it. If it attacks, fight back \u2013 aim for the face.\u201d It\u2019s a different situation with grizzlies If you\u2019re dealing with a grizzly that won\u2019t back off and an attack is imminent, you\u2019re advised to do the opposite. You should play dead. \u201cAct as unthreatening as possible with a grizzly. Play dead with a grizzly if it starts to attack,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cTuck and cover. Get into a fetal position. Wrap your hands around your neck. Lay on your stomach. Once you do that, 99 percent of the time the grizzly will move on.\u201d  NPS elaborates: \u201cRemain still until the bear leaves the area. Fighting back usually increases the intensity of such attacks. However, if the attack persists, fight back vigorously.\u201d   Fighting back a grizzly bear is the last resort \u2013 \u201cyour Hail Mary pass\u201d as Pratt called it \u2013 when all other options are out. An exception to this rule: If you\u2019re camping in a tent and are attacked, that bear likely sees you as food. NPS and Pratt say this is a time to fight. How do you tell a black bear from a grizzly? First off, know your area and read up on the bears there. In North America, grizzlies have a much more limited range than black bears do. In the Lower 48, they are in Washington, Montana, Idaho and Wyoming. And then in Alaska, too. They also cover large parts of western Canada. Black bears have more territory. They can be found in as many as 40 US states, much of Canada and even parts of northern Mexico, the National Wildlife Federation says. So say you\u2019re in Quebec, the Appalachians, the Ozarks, California or even parts of Florida, that\u2019s going to be a black bear. But if you\u2019re in Yellowstone or Glacier National Park, for instance, that could be a black bear or a grizzly. That\u2019s when it\u2019s crucial to know how to make a quick visual ID. You can\u2019t go by the color of the fur. Black bears can be black, brown, cinnamon, blond, blue-gray or white, according to Bear.org.  One of the best ways to tell the difference, Pratt said, is to look for a hump at the shoulders. Grizzlies have them. Black bears don\u2019t. She also said the face shapes are different. \u201cBlack bear faces look a little more cuddly to me, a little rounder, with a straight nose. A grizzly bear face looks more like a wild predator and has a dished shape.\u201d This NPS webpage has more helpful ways to tell the differences. Fun facts: Eight bear species can be found all over the world \u2013 from tropical Sri Lanka to the frigid reaches of Russia, Norway and Canada. And European websites such as Bear Watching Slovenia give many of the same safety tips as North Americans get. Bear spray and weapons Some people like to carry bear spray and/or a weapon with them when venturing into bear country.  Pratt is an advocate of the former and says be sure to practice using it first before going into the wild. NPS has helpful tips on using spray to ward off bears. She\u2019s more cautious about bringing firearms with you, especially if you\u2019re inexperienced. \u201cTaking a grizzly out with one shot would be tough. You need to be very experienced with a gun to increase your chance of safety.\u201d A Brigham Young University study in 2008 found spray more effective than a firearm. And spray doesn\u2019t permanently harm a bear. Some people like to carry bear bells on their hikes, hoping the noise will ward off the animals. But the park service says that \u201cYelling, clapping and talking are more effective ways of alerting a bear to your presence.\u201d What campers need to know If you\u2019re out camping overnight, you have extra considerations to take. Kyle Patterson, management specialist and public affairs officer at Rocky Mountain National Park, emailed CNN Travel some ways to keep hungry bears away. Patterson advised using a food storage locker if provided in campgrounds and picnic areas. Also, \u201cavoid storing food and coolers in your vehicle. If you must, store food in airtight containers in the trunk or out of sight. Close vehicle windows completely.\u201d Other tips and cautions: \u2022 Don\u2019t store food in tents or pop-up campers in campgrounds or in vehicles at trailheads. \u2022 Don\u2019t leave food, coolers and dirty cookware unattended. Park rangers may confiscate them and cite you. \u2022 Get rid of garbage in bear-resistant dumpsters and trash cans. Human-fed bears usually end up as chronic problems and need to be removed, Patterson said. \u201cA fed bear is a dead bear.\u201d The ball is in our court Pratt emphasized it\u2019s up to humans to be responsible to these creatures. \u201cThe bears are just being bears. We are way more of a threat to them. Bear attacks are so rare. And fatalities are even rarer,\u201d she said. \u201cThe bears\u2019 lives are more at threat than ours in encounters. I want people to have magical, wonderful experiences in the wild. I want people to feel OK about having these encounters.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/article/bear-encounters-prevent-attacks-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_article_breakfast-tacos-origins-mexico-texas", "text": "Two simple words can spark mouth-watering bliss or a series of blistering retorts in Texans: Breakfast tacos. In the Lone Star State, who gets the credit for these morning tortilla sensations can be a matter of haba\u00f1ero-hot debate. A highly contested Eater article in 2016 helped start a full-on Breakfast Taco War between Austin and San Antonio. While that particular battle eventually settled down, flare-ups continue. But to get a true picture of this simple food with a complex history, we must go beyond Texas and first look at another place: Mexico. Mouthwatering tacos in Monterrey The breakfast taco is actually part of a long parade of foods (pizza, for instance) whose fuzzy origins and various claims of authenticity spark ferocious debate. There\u2019s one thing we know for darn sure: Today, breakfast tacos are enjoyed on both sides of the Rio Grande River. In her CNN \u201cSearching for Mexico\u201d series, actor Eva Longoria traveled to Monterrey in the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n.     There, she enjoyed a breakfast taco with Mexican food bloggers Gerardo Alvarado and Ernesto Esquivel at Tacos Do\u00f1a Mary La Gritona, which has been serving central Monterrey for nearly 20 years.  \u201cThe breakfast taco may be the simplest of street food, but it\u2019s been been hitting the spot for the workers of Monterrey for nearly a century,\u201d narrates Longoria. \u2018Not a junkie food\u2019   CNN Travel caught up with Esquivel \u2013 born and raised in the border state of Sonora and resident of Monterrey for more than 10 years \u2013 to find out more. \u201cWhen I arrived in Monterrey, I discovered all the different types of tacos that everyone eats in the morning. You can have a taco of eggs. You can have a taco of meat. You can have a taco of potatoes.\u201d Esquivel describes breakfast tacos as \u201ca really fast food, but not a junkie food.\u201d  Esquivel said you can find breakfast tacos in other states in northern Mexico, but Monterrey and the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n are the culinary epicenter with more places to get them and a larger selection of fillings.  Some of the city\u2019s favorites are the machacado (dried beef) with eggs, the barbacoa (slow-cooked meat, often in a pit) and the deshebrada (shredded beef). In other words, you\u2019re in meat country. Timeline of the breakfast taco Esquivel said the breakfast taco goes back to the early 1900s and perhaps even earlier in Monterrey.  Compa\u00f1ia Fundidora, a former iron and steel foundry that dates to 1900 but is now a recreational and educational park, helped the breakfast taco get its start in Monterrey. Employees came \u201cto work really early, and so they had to have a really fast breakfast in the morning, and one fast breakfast in the morning is a breakfast taco.\u201d  And from there, the tacos spread into southern Texas, Esquivel said, which is reflected in the cuisine of today. \u201cI think the flavors here in Monterrey, mostly in the north, are similar to some flavors in Texas.\u201d Along with Do\u00f1a Mary\u2019s, he suggests these spots for a breakfast taco if you\u2019re in Monterrey: Tacos Rafa Ahogados, Tacos Piedra and Tony\u2019s Tacos. North of the Rio Grande   The river may mark a political line between two nations, but it has been no barrier at all to crossings of cuisine and culture. And Texas also shares a passion for the breakfast taco. You can tell that just from all the kerfuffles about them. \u201cNo Texas city can claim the breakfast taco,\u201d says Jos\u00e9 Ralat, the taco editor of Texas Monthly magazine. He places the ultimate credit south of the Rio Grande. \u201cIt comes from Mexico \u2013 where exactly, it\u2019s not really known. Geographically, the most likely source is northern Mexico. There is no literature that I have seen that can point to any particular city in northern Mexico.\u201d As for today, \u201cthey\u2019re popular in [the Mexican states of] Tamaulipas, Nuevo Le\u00f3n and Coahuila, which all border Texas,\u201d he said. Eddie Vega \u2013 who grew up in McAllen, across from the Mexican city of Reynosa in Tamaulipas state \u2013 is known as \u201cTaco Poet of Texas.\u201d He points out that historically, what\u2019s now south Texas was once part of Mexico.  Before 1836, \u201cthe border was further north. All this region was eating a combination of indigenous and Spanish food together.\u201d Vega said that growing up, breakfast tacos weren\u2019t some trendy food to him attracting attention from the likes of The New York Times and other coastal media. \u201cWhen you get to south Texas, and I\u2019m from the Valley, we had breakfast tacos, but they were in my house. My mom would make them. It\u2019s not something we\u2019d go to a restaurant to get because economically that region is very poor and nobody\u2019s eating out. Or not eating out in the morning especially.\u201d Enter Austin Ralat and Vega both said the breakfast taco was staple deep in south Texas and then San Antonio long before Austin got in on the action. So how did Austin become so synonymous with them? Austin has \u201ca great branding mentality, they have a knack for PR. Every year, Austin is flooded with coastal elites checking out South by Southwest,\u201d Ralat said. \u201cThey try some options, and then in their minds, they think it\u2019s an Austin thing. My job is to question the stuff \u2026 and let history speak for itself.\u201d  Ralat said San Antonio has \u201ca bit of an inferiority complex that they\u2019re often overlooked to the benefit of Austin when San Antonio is older, has more culture, it\u2019s more diverse, and the food is better.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, they\u2019re both Tex Mex towns, and breakfast tacos are Tex Mex. But they\u2019re also border food. When the Eater article came out\u201d \u2013 championing Austin as \u201chome\u201d of the breakfast taco \u2013 \u201cSan Antonians lost their minds.\u201d   Vega said the culinary history is too distant for any one place to stamp itself as originator or king purveyor. \u201cI don\u2019t know that one city \u2013 San Antonio, Corpus Christi, McAllen, Brownsville or Laredo \u2013 can claim it. You have differences with them because of ingredients.\u201d Movin\u2019 on Jessica Elizarraras, a Rio Grande Valley native and the executive producer for MySA.com, said many people have put the origins dispute behind them. \u201cI think at this point we\u2019ve mostly moved on from the great taco war of 2016,\u201d Elizarraras said in an email interview with CNN Travel. \u201cIs there occasional ribbing? Absolutely! Are there great tacos across the state? 1000 percent. The Mexican diaspora is far-reaching and so are their tacos.\u201d She cites a 2016 article by Gustavo Arellano as a detailed settlement of the issue that effectively shows Austin is not the start of the breakfast taco.  She also points out the regional differences within Texas. \u201cA flour tortilla in San Antonio tends to lean a bit puffier than its Rio Grande Valley/Coast counterparts. Con Huevos Tacos in San Antonio is the best of both worlds: a thin but sturdy tortilla, filled with fun, flavorful combinations.\u201d They\u2019ve gone nationwide   Ralat said he\u2019s now seeing breakfast tacos coast to coast. He was also recently in Nashville and saw them offered there.  \u201cI hesitate to eat them at a place that calls them Austin-style. \u2026 I want the food to be high quality. I don\u2019t want it to be spin.\u201d  Elizarraras suggests people just enjoy them \u2013 with or without huevos (eggs).  \u201cBreakfast tacos are ephemeral as they come, which makes them that much more magical,\u201d she said. \u201cBean and cheese is a great example of a breakfast taco that doesn\u2019t have eggs. \u2026 Chicharron en salsa (verde or rojo) is another example of a tasty taco that doesn\u2019t require eggs. Barbacoa \u2013 made using a whole cow-head, and more generally, beef cheeks \u2013 is a classic breakfast taco in San Antonio, often paired with Big Red [soda] for a Sunday morning treat.\u201d  The joy of it all In the end, why does the origin of a type of food even matter? \u201cPart of the issue is erasure. Just like with anything else in our Mexican-American culture, to feel left out of a conversation when you know you\u2019ve part of that conversation for a long time.\u201d Vega said. And back south of the Rio Grande, they are a source of unity, Esquivel said.  \u201cI think the breakfast tacos here in Monterrey \u2026 and the northeast of the country is something that unites everyone.\u201d  They\u2019re popular with the poor, the middle class and the rich, he said. \u201cThe place can be ugly. The place can be like in the streets. But you will see people in suits there eating breakfast tacos.\u201d  For Ralat, breakfast tacos are much more than a great way to start the morning. \u201cI think history, especially food history, is important to know because it provides another mirror for our culture. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to me that tortillas are the foundation of Mexican culture, and to break bread with someone is a sacred act. So let\u2019s take it literally, and say that you share tacos with someone else. That\u2019s so nice. And it\u2019s just so joyful.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/article/breakfast-tacos-origins-mexico-texas/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "travel"}}

Customs officers in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen intercepted the man traveling through Futian Port, a checkpoint between Hong Kong and mainland China, the agency said in a statement on Tuesday. During an inspection, officers found six canvas drawstring bags sealed with tape in the pockets of his pants. \u201cOfficers opened the bags and found that each bag contained a number of live snakes in various shapes and colors,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAfter counting, a total of 104 snakes were found.\u201d Five species of snakes were later identified \u2013 the milk snake, western hognose snake, corn snake, Texas rat snake and bullsnake \u2013 four of which are non-native to China.

{"id": "travel_turkish-oil-wrestling-festival-world-record", "text": "Under a pop-up tent on a sunbeaten patch of grass, a shirtless Cengizhan Koca is bent over a pair of black leather pants in prayer. But more than just prayer alone is needed to wriggle into the stiff-looking trousers emblazoned with his family name. He pours a bottle filled with a mixture of water and olive oil into the pants, and then with a few firm tugs on the waistband and a wiggle of the hips, he\u2019s in. Koca is one of hundreds of wrestlers competing at this year\u2019s Kirkpinar Oil Wrestling Festival in northwestern Turkey. Chiseled young men from all over the country, and even abroad, have come to compete in one of 15 age and weight classes. The sport is similar to regular wrestling, except here, the competitors are covered head to toe in olive oil. There are no mats either \u2013 the matches all take place in an overgrown grassy field inside a stadium \u2013 and more than a dozen fights take place simultaneously, each with their own referee. This year, there are only 752 wrestlers, down from roughly 3,500 who took part in an open competition in 2023. The sport\u2019s governing body told the Anadolu Agency state-run news service that qualifying requirements were added this year to cement Kirkpinar\u2019s status as \u201cthe Olympics of oil wrestling\u201d - but the move has been controversial with some competitors, according to local media. Record breaker The event in Edirne, just a stone\u2019s throw from the Greek border, is even older than the modern iteration of the Olympic Games. Originally conceived by 14th century Ottoman Sultan Orhan Ghazi as a way to keep his troops in shape for battle, the annual tradition has carried on through the generations and now holds the Guinness World Record for \u201coldest continuously sanctioned sporting competition.\u201d This year is the 663rd tournament. For many wrestlers, the sport runs in the family. Koca\u2019s father and uncle were wrestlers here too; now his brothers and cousins all compete. \u201cWrestling comes first in our lives. I mean, we almost do nothing but wrestle,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything is wrestling. It\u2019s like an inheritance left to us by our father.\u201d His first-round opponent, Abdullah Basar, also has the sport in his blood. \u201cWhy do I do this sport? Because, I am taking after my father, my grandfather, and my ancestors,\u201d Basar said. \u201cAnd of course, we hope that the next generation will carry on the tradition too.\u201d Even before the oil started flowing, pomp and pageantry welcomed the wrestlers, with the sound of drums and traditional Turkish flutes accompanying local officials through the streets of Edirne, in the shadow of the comparatively young, 450-year-old Selimiye Mosque. Among the dignitaries is this year\u2019s ceremonial grand marshal \u2013 a heavy-looking gold belt draped over one shoulder \u2013 an honor bestowed on whoever offers up the largest donation to the tournament. This year\u2019s donation was well over $250,000, according to Andalou. Next year\u2019s grand marshal has reportedly pledged more than $1 million. \u2018Blood and sweat\u2019 After the procession stops at the town square to honor modern Turkey\u2018s founding father Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, (who established the country 562 years after the tournament began), it heads to the local cemetery. Here, participants\u2019 prayers give a nod of respect to wrestlers past. A few hours later, centuries of tradition come to life through wrestlers present. Before the bouts begin, \u201coilers\u201d cover each competitor in the slippery cooking lubricant. The prize money for each competitor is relatively modest \u2013 around $17,000 for the winner of the top category - but this year, the real cash is in the olive oil itself, as global prices for the golden liquid skyrocket. A five-liter can of extra virgin these days can easily top $60, but Edirne\u2019s mayor, Filiz Gencan Ak\u0131n, insists the price of oil is no threat to the longevity of the sport. \u201cOf course, olive oil is a must for this sport. But we don\u2019t see it as a cost, but as an investment in keeping our ancestral sport alive forever,\u201d she told CNN. Koca and Basar are familiar foes. The pair faced off a few weeks ago at another tournament. Koca lost. They\u2019ve both spent months preparing for this day. \u201cWe got here through hard work, we shed blood and sweat,\u201d said Koca. With the battle drums beating in the background, the pair briefly hold hands, before being called on to begin. The new wave of competitors march onto the field in the traditional manner, hands slapping down on high knees with each step. A brief silent prayer and it\u2019s game on. Arms down trousers The olive oil makes it almost impossible for wrestlers to get a grip on their opponent unless they get hold of their pants. An arm down the trousers in this sport is completely within the rules. For more than half an hour Koca and Basar battle it out. Eventually Basar wears down his opponent and lifts him up in a bear hug for just long enough to end the match. After the referee raises his arm to signal he\u2019s the victor, Basar immediately walks over to console his distraught opponent. \u201cMy friend was upset, I tried to make him feel better, but this is wrestling. I told him, \u2018I\u2019ve won today, but you will win tomorrow,\u2019\u201d he said to CNN after the match. In the tent next door, Koca is found sitting on a mat looking dejected \u2013 oil-soaked pants still on. \u201cI feel like everything is over now,\u201d he said. \u201cI was emotional because I had high hopes. I wanted to make my family proud because so much effort and expense has been put into this, and I\u2019ve failed on day one.\u201d Basar went on to finish second in his weight class, taking home a $300 prize. For Koca, the tournament ended early, but the ancient sport itself seems poised to last at least another six centuries. \u201cThis is a sport that existed before the Republic of Turkey was founded and has become a tradition that we have continued ever since,\u201d Akin, the mayor, told CNN. \u201cIf you ask how this continues for so long, it is entirely a matter of passion.\u201d Guray Ervin and Tanem Zaman contributed to this story", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/turkish-oil-wrestling-festival-world-record/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_irish-pub-reconnected-romance-chance-encounters", "text": "Years after they\u2019d broken up, Tom Giuliani found himself thinking about the role of timing in his relationship with Susan Hall. Tom and Susan were on the same flight from the US to Ireland in the summer of 1989. But they never saw one another. Then, Tom and Susan were staying in the same hotel in Dromoland, County Clare, on Ireland\u2019s west coast. But they never crossed paths. \u201cIt\u2019s funny because the first thing I did when I arrived was take a walk, and everybody else went to bed \u2013 and now I know Sue also went for a walk,\u201d Tom tells CNN Travel today. But Tom and Susan walked in opposite directions, and so they remained strangers. The two Americans were visiting Ireland via the same organized tour company. But they were on separate tours, to opposite coasts. \u201cI was on the west coast of Ireland, she was going to the east coast of Ireland,\u201d says Tom. While the tours were heading in different directions, both began with a stop off at Bunratty Castle, a 15th-century tower house in County Clare. Inside the stone walls, the US visitors were treated to a banquet, accompanied by Irish musicians and interspersed with folk storytelling. But Tom and Susan didn\u2019t share a dinner table that evening. \u201cShe had the early dinner, I had the late dinner,\u201d says Tom. The two kept almost \u2013 but not quite \u2013 meeting. And that was only the beginning. Looking back four years later, Tom felt this series of almost-meetings \u2013 and how they\u2019d eventually crossed paths, connected, reconnected and then dated \u2013 was all a bit \u201ccosmic.\u201d But then he and Susan broke up. And while the split was amicable, with no ill-feelings, they hadn\u2019t spoken since. \u201cStill, she was always in the back of my mind,\u201d says Tom. \u201cI dated those four years. But I didn\u2019t forget her, at all.\u201d It was during one of these moments of nostalgia that Tom spontaneously decided to call Susan. It was late 1993, Susan\u2019s birthday. Tom figured he\u2019d pass on some birthday wishes, and see where she was at in life. It was a bit daunting, keying those digits into his landline phone four years later, but Tom figured he had nothing to lose. Maybe she wouldn\u2019t even pick up. But she did. Tom\u2019s heart skipped a beat when he heard Susan\u2019s voice again. \u201cHey,\u201d he said into the phone. \u201cHow have you been?\u201d A trip to Ireland Tom and Susan both joined the tour to Ireland in 1989 on the spur of the moment. Back then, Tom was in his early 30s. He was laser-focused on building his career, but also dreamed of traveling the world, at one point joining an airline travel club to try to get flight deals. \u201cEvery week they\u2019d send you a telegram, which would list flights they had for cheap. And you could sign up and leave the next weekend. Then this trip popped up,\u201d recalls Tom. \u201cIt was my first time in Europe. I\u2019d never been before. And so that\u2019s how I ended up in Ireland.\u201d As for Susan, she was a bit younger than Tom \u2013 in her 20s, still unsure what direction her life might take. \u201cI had just left a job,\u201d Susan tells CNN Travel today. \u201cAnd my mom and my older sister were hopping on this tour to Ireland, and I just decided to go with them \u2013 at the very last minute, probably with a week left or so. \u201cI had never really traveled that much before that. So it was very magical, to me, to go with them. That\u2019s how I ended up going on the tour.\u201d That first night in Ireland, Susan\u2019s tour party headed to Bunratty Castle for the early dinner. Afterward, they decamped to a nearby pub, Durty Nelly\u2019s, a yellow, thatched-roof building in the shadow of the castle\u2019s towers. Inside, tourists sampling Guinness mixed with pub regulars, including an older man playing an accordion and singing. Susan watched him play and, in between sips of her pint, cheered along with the music. The evening \u2013 with the castle, the dinner, the pub, the music \u2013 felt like the perfect start to her vacation. \u201cI thought Ireland was so incredible,\u201d says Susan. \u201cIt was so green and just beautiful. I thought the people were really friendly.\u201d When the accordion player finished a song, Susan took the opportunity to find the restroom. She was searching through the low-roofed building when she collided with a tall guy. Susan remembers meeting his eyes and being struck by him right away. This \u2013 of course \u2013 was Tom. \u201cI thought he was handsome,\u201d recalls Susan. \u201cVery cute.\u201d \u201cShe thought I was Irish,\u201d says Tom. \u201cI did think he was Irish,\u201d recalls Susan, laughing. \u201cBut I\u2019d had a few drinks. We just spoke really briefly.\u201d Over the noise of the other pub revelers, Susan and Tom chatted about the banquet dinner at Bunratty Castle. Tom mentioned his group were heading there shortly, and Susan realized he was also an American tourist. \u201cI told him the dinner was fun,\u201d recalls Susan. \u201cAnd that was pretty much it.\u201d As Susan descended into the throngs of people in the pub \u2013 still hunting for the restroom \u2013 Tom watched her walk away. \u201cShe was obviously beautiful,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s 5 feet 9. Beautiful. She caught my attention.\u201d Over the next few days, as Susan toured the east coast of Ireland \u2013 admiring castles, craggy landscapes and beaches \u2013 she thought about Tom a little bit, half wondering if they might run into each other again. \u201cHe definitely made an impression,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought he was really cute, handsome.\u201d And on the other side of the country, Tom, in between admiring \u201cthe greenest countryside and endless stone walls along the roads,\u201d also found his thoughts turning to the woman he\u2019d run into at the pub. \u201cI thought about Susan too,\u201d says Tom. \u201cBut I never thought I\u2019d run into her, because she said she was on the other coast.\u201d A second meeting When her Irish tour concluded, Susan boarded a plane home to the US at Dublin Airport, along with her mother and sister. After filling up half the aircraft in Dublin, the plane then stopped over at Shannon Airport to collect more passengers. Among them: Tom. \u201cSo that\u2019s where we saw each other for the second time,\u201d says Tom. As he boarded the aircraft, Tom spotted a glimpse of Susan, already seated. Later, he got up to stretch his legs and walked past Susan, who was sitting with her mother and sister. \u201cHe stopped for a minute to talk to us. And we made some small talk,\u201d recalls Susan. \u201cI was very surprised to see him and a little flustered too.\u201d A few hours later, the airplane halfway across the Atlantic, Tom and Susan ended up in the restroom line together. They talked a bit about their time in Ireland. There was something between them, they both felt it. And as they chatted, Susan wondered if Tom might ask for her number. \u201cI was hoping he would and was disappointed when he didn\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought that was it.\u201d Tom wanted to ask Susan out. He almost did, there and then. But he worried he\u2019d misread the signs, and he didn\u2019t want to make the atmosphere on board awkward. So he said nothing. As soon as he sat back down in his seat, Tom regretted this decision. \u201cBut we\u2019ll probably see each other in customs,\u201d he thought to himself. \u201cI\u2019ll ask her out when I see her at JFK.\u201d As soon as the airplane landed in New York, Tom realized this was never going to happen. The airport arrivals area was huge, and packed with people. \u201cIf you\u2019ve ever been to JFK customs, that thing\u2019s like three football fields long,\u201d says Tom. \u201cSo, needless to say, I didn\u2019t see her. So I didn\u2019t ask her out.\u201d Swallowing his disappointment, Tom focused on getting through the customs line and getting to the bus stop. He was heading back to his home in Pennsylvania a couple of hours away. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll never see her again,\u201d he thought, as he grabbed his bag from the luggage carousel and exited the building. After all, it was 1989. There was no option to look Susan up on social media \u2013 and he didn\u2019t know her last name anyway. Tom walked out of the building, he glanced around and spotted the bus stop. There was a bus that looked ready to leave. Tom started running, hopeful he might just make it. \u201cAnd as I was running to the bus, there she was \u2013 standing with her mom and sister, just getting ready to get on another bus,\u201d says Tom. Tom couldn\u2019t believe it. And Susan, about to board, couldn\u2019t believe it either. Tom reached Susan just in time. Slightly breathless, he dug out a business card from his pocket and passed it to her. \u201cI said to myself, \u2018if I saw you one more time, I\u2019d give you my card,\u2019\u201d said Tom. \u201cCall me.\u201d Susan \u2013 feeling slightly giddy in disbelief \u2013 took the card. A first date Back home in New Jersey, Susan played it cool and didn\u2019t call Tom right away. But while she was trying to project nonchalance, internally she was thrilled. \u201cI just remember being so excited,\u201d she says today. \u201cWhen he gave me his card, he didn\u2019t really have time to talk to me because he had to catch the bus. And I was just like, \u2018Oh my gosh.\u2019 He went his way, I went mine. Eventually I called him a few weeks later.\u201d Tom and Susan lived around two hours from one another, in neighboring states. Talking on the phone, the two decided Tom would come to New Jersey, and they agreed to go to an Irish pub. It felt appropriate, given where they\u2019d first met. \u201cI was very excited to call him and very nervous,\u201d Susan recalls. \u201cAnd then it was exciting seeing each other again. We each brought our Ireland photos and exchanged stories of our trips. We went to an Irish pub and played darts.\u201d From there, Tom and Susan started dating. Over the next few months, they saw one another pretty regularly. But then things started to dwindle. While they both really liked one another, it was clear they were in different stages of life. \u201cI just wanted to go out and have fun. Tom was very focused on advancing in his career,\u201d says Susan. \u201cThe timing was off.\u201d They went their separate ways. Cut to late 1993, when Tom called Susan out of the blue, on her birthday. Susan was pretty thrown when she heard his voice again. But it was good to hear from him, nice to speak with him. They talked for a little while. Then, Tom asked Susan if she\u2019d be interested in meeting up sometime. Susan hesitated. \u201cI was seeing someone else at the time,\u201d says Susan. \u201cI was in the process of breaking off that relationship. The timing just wasn\u2019t great.\u201d She said no. But in the weeks that followed, Susan \u2013 now officially single \u2013\u00a0found herself regretting turning Tom down. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, I really liked that guy. I really messed that up,\u201d she says. Susan confided in her mother, who\u2019d always liked Tom \u2013 she\u2019d never quite forgotten the joy on Susan\u2019s face when Tom found her at the JFK bus stop. \u2018My mom said, \u2018Listen, just call him. He\u2019s either going to say yes or no, you have nothing to lose, just call him and see what happens.\u2019\u201d So eventually, Susan called Tom. She invited him to join her as her date at a friend\u2019s black tie New Year\u2019s Eve party. Tom said yes. \u201cI was thrilled,\u201d he says today. \u201cI was thrilled Tom agreed to go with me,\u201d says Susan. \u201cHe picked me up at my family home. I walked down the stairs and he was standing there in black tie looking incredibly handsome.\u201d \u201cShe looked stunning coming down the stairs,\u201d recalls Tom. \u201cI knew I was a goner.\u201d The party was hosted by one of Susan\u2019s colleagues. When Susan turned up with Tom, her coworkers told he was a \u201cdefinite keeper.\u201d \u201cWe had a really great time at the party,\u201d says Susan. \u201cWe started dating from there.\u201d Timing aligned For Susan and Tom, timing seemed to have finally aligned. \u201cAfter we started dating the second time, I figured she had to be the one,\u201d says Tom. \u201cWe were definitely soulmates,\u201d says Susan. \u201cBut also, timing has to be there, too. So once the timing was there, we really realized that, \u2018This is the person.\u2019\u201d A few months later, in the spring of 1994, Tom and Susan returned to Europe together. \u201cWe started out in London and drove to Scotland,\u201d Susan recalls. She had a feeling Tom might propose on the trip. And she was right. \u201cI had the ring ready,\u201d says Tom. \u201cI was waiting for the perfect opportunity.\u201d In Scotland, the couple stayed at Culcreuch Castle, near Loch Lomond. At the time, the castle doubled as a hotel. It was a little reminiscent of Bunratty Castle, and Tom decided it was the perfect spot for the proposal. \u201cHe arranged for the ring to be put on top of my dessert after dinner at the castle,\u201d recalls Susan. \u201cThe staff was so lovely, they played Marvin Gaye for us.\u201d Tom and Susan planned their wedding celebrations for June 1995. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t want to wait and ended up eloping to Las Vegas on November 22, 1994,\u201d says Susan. \u201cIt was crazy and super fun. We ended up having a vow renewal and reception at our original reception spot in June of 1995.\u201d A year later, Tom and Susan \u2013 who took Tom\u2019s name, becoming Susan Giuliani \u2013 welcomed a son, Evan. And in 1999, their daughter Paige was born. \u201cWe were so excited to start a family together,\u201d says Susan. When their kids were 10 and 12, Tom and Susan returned to Ireland. They called into Durty Nelly\u2019s, the place they\u2019d met 20 years previously and told the manager their story. Susan couldn\u2019t believe it when she realized the same accordion player was still there, still playing. \u201cWe were so excited to share with our children where we first met,\u201d says Susan. 35 years later Today, Susan and Tom are retired and living in New Jersey, focused on family and travels. They\u2019re currently planning an extended trip to Ireland next year and intend to once again return to the site of their first meeting. In the meantime, they\u2019re making travel plans for their 30th wedding anniversary this year \u2013 they\u2019ll be heading on a river cruise followed by a transatlantic cruise. Susan will chronicle the trip on her social media account. She started posting regularly in 2022, under the handle @suzanhall.overfiftygenx. For Susan, Instagram and Tiktok have become unexpected creative outlets. \u201cIt has really given me an opportunity to express myself and talk about the things I enjoy,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve monetized my account and feel incredibly proud of what I have accomplished with it.\u201d Occasionally Tom helps Susan film her posts. She calls him her \u201cbiggest cheerleader and best friend.\u201d It\u2019s for this, and many other reasons, that Susan and Tom are thankful timing eventually aligned for them. They can\u2019t imagine a world in which they didn\u2019t cross paths in Ireland, didn\u2019t spot one another in JFK airport, didn\u2019t reconnect four years later. \u201cThe timing of getting out of customs at the right time to see Susan\u2026It\u2019s the cosmos at work\u2026\u201d reflects Tom. \u201cI believe that things happen for a reason,\u201d says Susan. \u201cAnd the timing has to be right \u2013 somebody could be your soulmate, could be the right person for you. But if you\u2019re not at a place in your life for you to receive that, or see that, then you might just miss your soulmate.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/irish-pub-reconnected-romance-chance-encounters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_article_how-to-survive-alligator-attack", "text": "Jeffrey Heim woke up on May 30, 2021, with one thing on his mind: Sharks.  Specifically, shark teeth. They\u2019re his passion and his business. An unsuccessful attempt the day before to find any of them only fueled his obsession to find some on his next outing, he told CNN Travel recently. So on a hot, sunny Sunday in Sarasota County, Florida, the 25-year-old Heim proceeded to the Myakka River on a spot about 45 minutes from the Gulf of Mexico. He had been there numerous times and was comfortable with plunging into its murky waters to find the teeth of extinct megalodons in the riverbed. He put on his wetsuit, mask, fins and snorkel and entered the water from the shore, not far from a restaurant along the riverbank.  Heim slipped beneath the surface. He was under no more than one minute when he felt something. Something bad. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything, didn\u2019t see anything. I just felt like a blunt force object \u2013 like someone \u2026 swinging a baseball bat and just whacking my head. But mostly what I felt was what I thought was a huge boat just slamming into me and just pulling me down.\u201d To his shock, it wasn\u2019t a boat.  He was in the water, alone and face-to-face with an alligator.  Gator attacks: Rare but fascinating   Heim was in a situation many people probably fear but very few actually experience: an attack by an alligator. An estimated 5 million wild American alligators are spread out across 10 states in Southeast and beyond, including parts of North Carolina and even the extreme southeastern tip of Oklahoma. Louisiana has an estimated 2 million wild gators in a state of about 4.65 million people. Florida sports roughly 1.25 million alligators (and more than 1,000 American crocodiles). Georgia has about a quarter of a million. Some of these gators inhabit places where lots of people live and many others vacation, such as lakes and rivers all across Florida and coastal South Carolina. Yet gator attacks aren\u2019t that frequent and deaths even more infrequent (deadly attacks from dogs and horses and other mammals are more common). There were 442 unprovoked bite incidents in Florida from 1948 to 2021, and 26 of these bites resulted in people dying, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conversation Commission. It turns out gators, in natural conditions, simply aren\u2019t that interested in people, according to Kimberly Andrews, a gator and snake expert with a doctorate in ecology from University of Georgia\u2019s Marine Extension and Georgia Sea Grant and who manages its Coastal Ecology Lab.  \u201cWe are not their prey. If you think about it, we\u2019re quite dangerous to attack. We\u2019ve got arms and legs. We can stand upright. We can walk, we can swim. \u2026 We\u2019re not a good animal to pick a fight with.\u201d \u201cUnless they\u2019re confronted, they\u2019re going to stay on their own turf.\u201d Nonetheless, people continue to be fascinated by such possible encounters. Overblown reputation     Andrews wants to dispel the notion of gators as aggressive, ravenous menaces on the move. \u201cThey\u2019re called ambush predators. We also call these \u2018sit-and-wait\u2019 predators,\u201d she said.  They\u2019re large, so it\u2019s \u201cenergetically costly for them to be really active. \u2026 We would be considered an active forager. We go out and find our food.\u201d Not so with gators. \u201cWhen you come down to it, they\u2019re not that maneuverable. Large body. Small legs. And this also plays into why the perception of their danger is exaggerated from the actuality.\u201d  Nonetheless, caution is advised when you\u2019re in gator territory, be that at golf courses, swamps, lakes, rivers and hiking and bike trails and fishing spots along waterways. Best defense: Avoid an attack  Education is key to avoiding a bad encounter, Andrews said. Start with knowing when gators are most active. Courtship season starts as spring warms up; mating extends in early summer; and in Okefenokee Swamp in southeastern Georgia, \u201cwe start to see eggs hatch out starting in September and October. \u2026 And that\u2019s when the females are most protective when they feel someone is threatening their babies,\u201d Andrews said. Your best season is winter: If it\u2019s cold, \u201cthey\u2019re not doing whole lot.\u201d When temperatures start settling into the 80s (27 Celsius), gators become mostly nocturnal. So it\u2019s best to avoid that refreshing night dip in unknown waters when it\u2019s hot. Don\u2019t provoke, don\u2019t feed, don\u2019t panic   Unprovoked attacks are rare, Andrews said. People are usually the provocateurs, not the gators. Gators can be disturbed or confused when folks have been known to try to grab them by their tails or go in for close-up photos of sunning gators Even worse, people will feed them. Then the reptiles start to associate humans with food. That\u2019s when gators can be most dangerous \u2013 when they\u2019ve lost their natural fear or disinterest in people. \u201cThey\u2019re more likely to take the easy way out and get our food than to do the work to fight for it,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cIn areas where we have high rates of tourism but not a lot of education and oversight of how people are interacting with alligators, we see feeding issues.\u201d  If you do have a gator encounter, she suggests staying calm and respecting its territory  \u201cSay you\u2019re kayaking, and you see an alligator, just keep going past it. Give it a wide berth, as much as the space will allow,\u201d Andrews said.  \u201cDon\u2019t take the paddles and slap the water. Sometimes people do that to scare the alligator off,\u201d but you\u2019re actually indicating you\u2019re a direct threat.  \u201cIf for some reason they start to swim toward you \u2026 usually try to go in the other direction and just show you\u2019re not interested. Or paddle right on by and ignore the animal.\u201d Also, never mess with the reptiles\u2019 children. \u201cWe always tell people that those one-foot baby alligators, even though they\u2019re so cute, they\u2019re the most dangerous sized alligator to mess with.\u201d That\u2019s because there\u2019s possibly a nearby mother ready to protect her young. More ways to avoid an attack   Authoritative websites have plenty of good advice to avoid a dangerous encounter. From the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory at the University of Georgia: \u2022 Don\u2019t feed ducks, turtles or other animals that share waters with alligators.  \u2022 Stay about 60 feet (18 meters) or more away from an adult alligator. If an alligator hisses or lunges at you, you are too close. \u2022 If you\u2019re driving, let an alligator cross the road. They move across roadways the most often in spring and summer.  \u2022 Supervise pets and children when you\u2019re in gator territory. \u201cLarge alligators do not recognize the difference between domestic pets and wild food sources,\u201d the SREL says. \u2022 Avoid heavy vegetation in and near the water\u2019s edge.  The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission also advises: \u2022 Never swim outside of posted areas, and swim only during daylight hours. Alligators are most active between dusk and dawn. \u2022 Get rid of fish scraps in garbage cans at boat ramps and fish camps; don\u2019t toss them in the water. Experts also advise people to call local or state authorities if you see alligators roaming around neighbors and other places you wouldn\u2019t expect. Do not try to handle the reptiles yourself. As for Jeffrey Heim, these tips were more than theory. Mission: Survival   Heim was in serious trouble, and he knew it. The gator had already bit him in the skull and on the hand. And it was coming toward him again. The gator \u201cpulled my mask off and pulled my head down towards my stomach. And then I come up, head above water. I no longer have the mask with the GoPro that\u2019s filming. And we\u2019re both looking at each other, and we both sit there for about two or three seconds, and I feel my head.\u201d  He wasn\u2019t sure what he was feeling at the time, but he learned later it was his scalp, partially torn off his skull and flapping in the water. Then \u201cshe lunges at me and I back away calmly \u2026  like I would with my experience with sharks, you don\u2019t want to act like prey. So I just backed away to keep my space.\u201d \u201cAnd then she really aggressively lunged at me \u2026\u201d  What to do if you\u2019re attacked   Heaven forbid you\u2019re that person like Heim who is being attacked by an alligator. Would you know what to do? If the gator is trying to drag you under the water, \u201cyou have to assume at this point you\u2019re fighting for your life, and you\u2019ve got to give it all you\u2019ve got,\u201d Andrews said.  \u201cWe recommend trying to poke them in the eye, hitting them in the top part of the skull or the side of the jaw. Those points are sensitive on alligators just like they are on us,\u201d she said. In a water attack, the danger is more from drowning than the bite, Andrews said. So get to land if possible. \u201cWe\u2019re better on land than they are. They\u2019re better in the water.\u201d But don\u2019t assume all is safe if you\u2019re on land. And the alligator has more in its arsenal that a fearsome set of teeth.  You can be injured if you\u2019re hit by the tail. Gators can also whip around with their skull and use it like a battering ram. Andrews knows first-hand how dangerous that can be.   She was part of a capture team once that had a gator taped up and its mouth secured when it unexpectedly whipped its head around.  \u201cIt actually hit me broad with the side of its head across my shins \u2026 and I blacked out. And I wondered, \u2018Oh my gosh, did I fracture my shin bone?\u2019 I had a lump the size of a tennis ball. It is amazing how muscular and powerful they are,\u201d Andrews recalled. The gator uses its mouth. Use yours. \u201cScream, make as much noise [as you can], not only fight back but make yourself as big and as much a pain in the rear end as you possibly can.\u201d If people are nearby, they should call 911 for help, Andrews said. If a pole is nearby, someone can beat on the gator and give it another target.  \u201cAnother person in an attempt to rescue you should never come in the water after you and the alligator. They can help you most by being on the ground and helping you get to the ground,\u201d Andrews said.  Other ways to fend off an attack   Here are some more survival tips from various wildlife departments and other experts: \u2022 If you can escape on land, run away in a straight line. Experts debunk the advice to zig-zag. Gators can move really fast on land, but only in short bursts and distances before they tire out. \u2022 Try to cause a gag reflex by jamming any objects you can reach into the back of the alligator\u2019s mouth. \u2022 Sometimes a gator will reposition its prey in its mouth. With its jaw back open, that is your chance to escape. \u2022 \u201cAlligators clamp down with powerful jaws, then twist and roll. If an alligator bites your arm, it may help to grab the alligator and roll with it to reduce tearing of the arm,\u201d according to advice from the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources. \u2022 Get immediate medical attention if bitten. Alligator bites often result in serious infection.   All of this is specific to American alligators, Andrews emphasizes.  Other crocodilian species in places such as Africa and Australia can be more aggressive. We\u2019re actually prey-sized for some of these, she said.  But the relatively few crocodiles in southern Florida aren\u2019t known for attacking people. The escape   One of Andrews\u2019 survival tips came in very hand handy as the female gator lunged yet again at Heim. \u201cI really backed away. Got out of that river as quickly as I could. I climbed out of the six-foot bank and stumbled over to the parking lot.\u201d He was about to pass out, but he was able \u201cto yell over to some people over at that restaurant.\u201d Fortunately, they heard his cries for help and were able to assist him with a first aid kit from the restaurant and call 911. While waiting for the paramedics, he wasn\u2019t in pain. But \u201cthe whole time I\u2019m sitting down just super loopy and exhausted. That\u2019s when I thought I was going to die.\u201d He ended up in the ICU in a hospital for two days but was back at work the next week \u201cwith staples in my head.\u201d  Lessons learned   Heim has now had time to reflect on what he did that day and on what others can learn from his attack. \u201cI knew there were gators there. This day, I basically did everything wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cI was aware it was gator mating season, but I went to the river with too much confidence, especially being alone, and free diving, which I had never done in that river before.\u201d \u201cThat cockiness, or confidence, led to the bite, honestly, even though this was an uncharacteristically aggressive alligator apparently. It was still the wrong time of year to go.\u201d  Like other young people who have spent time in the watery wilds in the Southeast, he was lulled into a false sense of security because he had been around gators before with no ill results. \u201cI was casually looking around for gators, but if I had even seen one, I had dove with them before and it hadn\u2019t caused an issue.\u201d \u201cI think the difference was this was near a restaurant, and fed gators are the most aggressive gators. So that\u2019s what the gator professionals believe contributed to this attack, too,\u201d Heim said.   \u201cIf you\u2019re going to dive in a river like that, which I don\u2019t suggest anymore, don\u2019t free dive. You\u2019re going to go up and down like their prey. And you\u2019re going to look much smaller that you actually are.\u201d \u201cWeigh all risks. Anything can happen at anytime to anyone. None of us are invincible. And I think it was the youth in me being a little too confident.\u201d  Heim has been chastened, but not chased off. He continues to search for shark teeth and has ramped up operations for his business, SHRKco. His approach is different now. He\u2019s more cautious. He said he has more and better equipment. He\u2019s even been diving back in the Myakka twice since the attack. However, he now goes with other people, including gator experts.  Andrews said it\u2019s crucial for people to co-exist with alligators because they\u2019re an Indispensable part of the ecology as an apex predator keeping populations of other animals in check. \u201cIn the South, they\u2019re part of our heritage. What a charismatic and iconic feature of our landscapes. It should be: We like our sweet tea. We like our grits. We like our alligators. This is part of who we are.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/article/how-to-survive-alligator-attack/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "travel"}}

The blaze erupted at the top of the spire of the gothic Our Lady of the Assumption Cathedral in Rouen, in the northern region of Normandy. Images posted on X by Normandy\u2019s prefecture, or regional administration, show smoke billowing from the top of the building, which is currently undergoing restoration works and is considered a significant piece of French medieval architecture. The prefecture confirmed on X that the cathedral was evacuated following the outbreak of the flames and that emergency services were working at the scene. In total, 70 firefighters and 40 vehicles were deployed to the site, while additional firefighting forces from the neighboring region of Oise were also mobilized. The prefecture later announced that the fire had been put out. St\u00e9phane Gouezec, an official from the local fire department, said that \u201can inventory is being made of works that could be affected\u201d by the water used to contain the blaze.\u00a0\u201cWe may have to take some works to safety,\u201d he added. Patrick Waeselynck, the owner of a nearby cafe, described the moment he noticed the fire. \u201cFirst sunny day, there\u2019s a big outside seating area, people are sitting down, we\u2019re going over to take the order and we hear, \u2018Fire!,\u2019\u201d he told French broadcaster BFMTV. \u201cI turn around and I see the cathedral spire, the tarpaulin that was protecting the restoration work, which was burning, big flames, black smoke.\u201d The construction of Rouen cathedral dates from the 12th century and it was built and rebuilt over a period of 800 years.

{"id": "travel_uk-tourism-drop-visitor-numbers-election", "text": "It\u2019s hardly a great tourism slogan. \u201cBritain is grinding to a halt\u201d was the verdict of the UK\u2019s Labour Party on the country they hoped to govern, as they were setting out their case for election in June. On July 4, they won by a landslide, promising change. As residents wonder what to expect day-to-day, those abroad might wonder what it means for their travel plans. Because one industry that could do with a change is tourism. Since time immemorial, visitors have flocked to the UK. Its heritage and cultural sites have traditionally made it one of the jewels in Europe\u2019s crown. Yet while visitor numbers are up across the board on the continent \u2013 nearly all EU member states saw numbers rise in 2023 year-on-year \u2013 the UK has not yet caught up with pre-pandemic numbers. Nearly 41 million overseas residents visited the UK in 2019. In 2023, 37.68 million entered \u2013 a drop of 7.3%. Compare that with Italy, which set a new record for arrivals numbers in 2023. Only Luxembourg saw a drop of 0.1% fewer tourists. What\u2019s more, international visitors applying for a tourist visa were down by 19% on pre-pandemic numbers. The slow recovery coincides with tourism-allied hiccups. Regular strikes have been hampering transport. \u201cRail cancelations are at record levels,\u201d according to the new government in its pre-election manifesto. The UK has a glorious coastline, but in recent years many beaches are increasingly polluted by sewage. Tax-free shopping for tourists has been axed, and EU visitors now need a passport to visit, which most don\u2019t have. And in 2024, the rhetoric around safety in the capital has been ramped up. In February, then prime minister Rishi Sunak suggested the country was descending into \u201cmob rule.\u201d He also flagged a 20% rise in knife crime in London in May. His comments were political, made while campaigning for local elections. Yet few listening from abroad would have noted the context. So what\u2019s gone wrong for the UK \u2013 and can the incoming government turn it around? Labour\u2019s pre-election manifesto, in which the party outlined its plans for the country, pretty much ignored the tourism industry. But it didn\u2019t mince its words when describing the problems. \u201cBritain is grinding to a halt,\u201d it said. \u201cRail cancelations are at record levels\u2026 Conservative chaos has seen major projects abandoned, decades-long delays\u2026 and our infrastructure crumbling.\u201d The party has promised to \u201cmodernize\u201d UK transport infrastructure, \u201crebuilding Britain.\u201d The railways will be brought under public ownership. Those traveling by car will be pleased to know that Labour also pledged to repair potholes. However none of this will be quick. Labour\u2019s infrastructure overhaul is based on a 10-year plan. Shifting priorities Is the UK really doing that badly or have travel trends shifted, post-pandemic? For Tom Jenkins, CEO of the European Tourism Organisation, it\u2019s the latter. \u201cI think the UK is doing perfectly well but we\u2019ll see more people going to [continental] Europe,\u201d he says of 2024, adding that there\u2019s \u201callegedly a slight plateau of American demand for the UK.\u201d Patricia Yates, CEO of VisitBritain, disagrees, saying that American visitors have \u201cdriven our recovery since the pandemic.\u201d Kayla Zeigner, owner of travel agency Destination Europe, says she is booking ever-more trips to the UK. But for Marcy Zyonse, owner of Live The Dream Travel, a luxury vacations company, the UK has been hit by changing post-pandemic travel trends. \u201cThe appetite for epic, culturally immersive travel has been so strong in the past couple of years,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople were starved for that. In the US, we didn\u2019t go beyond the Caribbean for a couple of years, so people are looking to do that Greece or Italy trip. We\u2019ve missed out on two or three years of travel, and I think the UK is too low down on the list.\u201d English-speakers want a more exotic experience, she says \u2013 starting with a foreign language. After all, the UK is known for history, culture and the royals \u2013 all of which will be around next year. It\u2019s easier to prioritize that for a much-needed Mediterranean break. And that heritage has also meant the outgoing government has let the tourism industry slide, says Yates. \u201cThere\u2019s a view that we have enormous strength in our culture and heritage, and people will just come,\u201d she says. \u201cThat isn\u2019t the case. Like every export industry, we have to pitch \u2013 to tell people why they should come now. The balance of being a history and heritage destination is that it was there 10 years ago and will be there in 10 years.\u201d There\u2019s also a hangover from the pandemic, when UK travel rules were particularly chaotic, say experts. Destinations that opened early got visitors raving about their first post-lockdown trips \u2013 which had a knock-on effect. \u201cCurrent hotspots are destinations that opened early in 2021 to American tourists, which created a huge surge in demand,\u201d says Zeigler. Zyonse agrees. \u201cYou guys in the UK were behind, and people lost confidence. People booking in 2021 for 2022 didn\u2019t book the UK, and the effect snowballed. Social media has driven people to those places [that opened up earlier].\u201d Making Britain \u2018great\u2019 again So what\u2019s to be done? For Yates, the new government could use tourism as an economy-booster \u2013 to the tune of 7% growth every year, she says, according to VisitBritain\u2019s projections. \u201cThe strength of tourism is that you can dial up quickly \u2013 we don\u2019t need to build lots of infrastructure,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a case of promoting the right places at the right time to the right customers.\u201d Promotion is tricky in itself. The outgoing Conservative government was infamous for its \u201causterity\u201d cuts to public spending. In evidence to parliament in March 2024, VisitBritain revealed that its marketing budget was around \u201c\u00a318 million ($23 million) annually, compared to over 80 euros million ($85.5 million) for Ireland.\u201d Back in November 2021, Yates told CNN that VisitBritain didn\u2019t know what its budget would be from March 2022. Today, she explains, it has a \u00a319.8 million core budget, and gets around the same amount from another government campaign. That\u2019s still around half of Ireland\u2019s budget \u2013 so private-sector funding is used to boost it. \u201cWe know that for every \u00a31 invested we get \u00a315 spent by tourists \u2013 a slice goes to the treasury, and money goes directly from international visitors into the economy. It\u2019s a win-win,\u201d she says. But she\u2019s keen for the new government to help take things further. \u201cTourism delivers over three million jobs, around 10% of the economy,\u201d she says. \u201cTo have a real growth plan, we have to make a statement about Britain overseas that will drive visitors and investment.\u201d Welcoming visitors Not many tourists will have cared about political instability \u2013 as Zeigler says, \u201cAmericans are dealing with our own political chaos.\u201d But Yates says that what does cut through is \u201cthe message of welcome.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s hugely important as a driver for international visitors,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes Britain has done that well, like during the London Olympics. Sometimes we don\u2019t score as well. We need to look at how we position Britain as a welcoming destination, and how we look at borders and visas.\u201d In the 2023 Anholt-Ipsos Nation Brands Index, which ranks 60 nations on a range of attributes, the UK received its lowest ever rating for \u201cWelcome.\u201d Its rankings for \u201cCulture\u201d and \u201cPeople\u201d also dropped, though overall it rose two places to fourth position. A visa for a Chinese visitor to the UK lasts a year, but costs the same about as a 10-year visa to the US, she says. Marcus Lee, CEO of China Travel Online says that visa efficiency is one of the top three drivers for Chinese tourists. Visitors from the Gulf states have increased since the UK introduced a speedy \u201celectronic travel authorization\u201d scheme to fast-track their applications, says Yates. The scheme was due to expand to Europe and US markets \u2013 it will now be up to the Labour government to do so. Meanwhile the self-styled \u201chostile environment\u201d towards immigration of the last government hasn\u2019t helped either. \u201cFor tourism, we want an efficient and effective border, but we do want people to come,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need to think about language.\u201d She says that people who visit the UK on vacation are 18% more likely to invest in the country \u2013 and investment is something the new government will be looking for. Brexit side effects As a result of Brexit, in 2021 the UK government abolished tax-free shopping for non-EU citizens. It means the UK is now the only European country not offering tax-free shopping to visitors from outside the continent. Data from New West End Company, which represents over 600 businesses in central London, in February showed that although visitor numbers in 2023 to the area were just 4% below 2019 levels, spending was down 19%. Visitors from the Gulf states \u2013 some of the wealthiest tourists to grace the UK \u2013 were up 20% on 2019 figures, yet they only spent 10% more. The pattern was repeated with tourists from across the globe. US tourists were up 8% but spent 14% less. In Italy and Spain, however, US spending was up by 143% and 179% respectively. \u201cThe impact of losing tax-free shopping is clear to see,\u201d says Dee Corsi, chief executive of the NWEC. \u201cWhile the UK strives to return to pre-pandemic levels of travel and spend, continental Europe\u2019s recovery continues at pace. \u201cWhilst the likes of Italy and France are actively leveraging tax-free shopping as a driver of growth, British businesses continue to trade at a disadvantage. With domestic spend remaining squeezed, a continued decline of tourist spending will have a knock-on effect on employment rates, inward investment, and supply chains across the nation.\u201d She calls bringing back tax-free shopping a \u201crare, golden opportunity for the government to\u2026 inject a shot of growth back into the economy, with a tried-and-tested scheme and a captive audience.\u201d \u201cWe would urge the new government to grasp this opportunity with both hands,\u201d she adds. Meanwhile, EU citizens now need a passport to visit the UK, where pre-Brexit they could cross the border with their ID cards. In 2021, Jenkins told CNN that three-quarters of Europeans don\u2019t have passports. Then there are clouds on the horizon regarding getting in and out. When the new ETIAS scheme launches, every traveler entering the Schengen area for the first time will need their biometric data captured. \u201cIt\u2019ll be time consuming initally,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s evidence that really bad entry systems deter people.\u201d \u2019Bridgerton\u2019 to the rescue? So what can be done? For Zyonse, VisitBritain should spend that marketing budget on attracting influencers and travel advisors to lesser-known destinations. A self-declared lover of the UK, who calls London \u201ca better version of New York,\u201d she says that the post-pandemic drive for more \u201cepic\u201d adventures calls for a different approach. Timelapse videos of an elevator going up London\u2019s Shard skyscraper, or something more wild in the Lake District, could attract social media likes, she says. She also thinks that the \u201cmajority\u201d of US family trips are driven by children\u2019s choices. She just went to Greece to give her daughter a \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d experience, and says that the UK \u201cneeds to get young girls posting on social media wearing a crown, or having afternoon tea, or doing something \u2018Bridgerton\u2019-related.\u201d She\u2019ll approve of VisitBritain\u2019s next big campaign, then. Launching at the end of 2024, \u201cStarring Great Britain\u201d will revolve around filming locations, says Yates, who adds that her team also wants to promote cheaper, out-of-season travel. For Yates, the new government offers a chance to grow the industry. But she warns that the UK needs to revamp its international reputation, wishing for it \u201cto be seen internationally as a welcoming, culturally diverse, vibrant country that people want to visit, send their kids to school and invest in.\u201d With the new government promising change from day one, it might not be long until she sees her dreams coming true.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/uk-tourism-drop-visitor-numbers-election/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/14/2024", "section": "travel"}}
