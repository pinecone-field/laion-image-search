The oil spilled into the city-state\u2019s waters after a Netherlands-flagged dredger, Vox Maxima, hit Singapore-flagged bunker vessel, Marine Honor, on Friday afternoon, according to the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA). While the oil leak from the vessel had been contained and treated with dispersants as of Saturday,\u00a0some of the treated fuel had spread due to the\u00a0tidal currents, according to the MPA. The oil spill has spread from the busy Pasir Panjang Terminal cargo port, less than 10 kilometers (6 miles) from Sentosa, the country\u2019s popular resort island home to luxury hotels, golf courses and\u00a0Universal Studios Singapore. The incident occurred at the start of the Hari Raya Haji long holiday weekend, during which locals and tourists alike were expected to flock to Sentosa and other landmarks. While the scale of environmental damage of the spill remains unclear, local conservation group Marine Stewards posted photos of oil-soaked birds and shorelines on its Facebook page. \u201cThere have been many cases of wildlife affected \u2014 a number of kingfishers, otters and monitor lizards covered in oil, seabirds whose legs are stained with oil. We have also received reports of dead fish and a dead sea snake,\u201d said Marine Stewards founder Sue Ye in a statement. Cleanup efforts were ongoing Monday with about 100 workers deployed across Sentosa\u2019s beaches, a spokesperson from the Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC) told CNN. Sentosa\u2019s beaches remain open to the public but swimming and water activities are not allowed at Tanjong, Palawan and Siloso beaches on the west coast of the island, the SDC added. The outlying islands of St. John\u2019s, Lazarus and Kusu were closed off on Sunday evening as the slick had spread to the shores of the first two locations, which are popular among day trippers via ferries and yacht charters, according to a joint statement from the National Parks Board, together with scientists and volunteers from Friends of Marine Park. Authorities deployed skimmer vessels for the cleanup efforts and laid close to 1,500 meters\u00a0(4,921 feet) of oil absorbent booms to protect a coastal natural reserve lined with mangroves. Singapore is a global shipping and fuel bunkering hub that sits along a narrow, busy strait connecting the Indian Ocean with the South China Sea. Measuring about 13 kilometers (8 miles) long,\u00a019 kilometers (11.8 miles)\u00a0wide and dotted with several small islands, it is one of the world\u2019s busiest commercial waterways where around 1,000 ships pass through every day. Heng Kiah Chun, regional campaign strategist for Greenpeace, said the incident was a \u201cwake-up call\u201d on the need to phase out fossil fuels that bring permanent harm to people and the planet. \u201cThe oil spill is a growing environmental catastrophe that is impacting some of the region\u2019s most important and biodiverse marine protected areas and fisheries areas,\u201d Heng said.

{"id": "travel_south-korea-kpop-visa-intl-hnk", "text": "South Korea will soon launch a new visa for foreign nationals who dream of training like a K-pop idol, in a bid to boost its tourism industry back to pre-pandemic levels. The \u201cK-Culture Training Visa\u201d will be open to foreigners who want to train in K-pop dancing, choreography and modeling, the finance ministry announced on Monday. Applicants don\u2019t necessarily need to audition or have a callback offer from a talent agency \u2013 at least not yet \u2013 as more details are expected to come out later this year. The surge in interest toward all things Korean\u00a0has prompted many foreign fans to travel to South Korea and even\u00a0learn the language, with some splashing out on full-on pilgrimages to visit the filming locations of K-pop music videos and K-dramas. Seoul now aims to use its culture\u2019s popularity as a tourism draw for more people worldwide, possibly easing barriers for travelers from Southeast Asia. Last year, travelers from countries like Thailand and the Philippines made up more than a fifth\u00a0of total visitors to South Korea, according to the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism (MCST), despite sometimes lengthy visa requirements. The rise of South Korean cultural exports since the 1990s, dubbed the Hallyu Wave or K-wave, has exploded in the last decade, with super-groups like BTS and Blackpink breaking though international music charts and\u00a0Korean drama series becoming more popular on streaming platforms. K-pop is already the most-cited reason for visiting the country, according to the MCST, with particularly strong interest from overseas fans from Southeast Asia, Europe and the US. Korean celebrities have been heavily featured travel advertisements with Emmy-winning \u201cSquid Game\u201d actor Lee Jung-jae becoming the honorary tourism ambassador for the country, while flagship carrier Korean Air even collaborated with boy band SuperM for its in-flight safety video in 2019. But while the nationalities of those entering the country are becoming more diverse,\u00a0tourism has been slow to recover to its pre-pandemic levels, according to the finance ministry. Last year, around 11 million people visited the country \u2013 a slight boost from the year prior but far fewer than in 2019, when more than 17.5 million tourists visited, according to government data. Tourism revenue also continued to fall short,\u00a0generating $15.1 billion in 2023, 25% less than the $20 billion seen in 2019. The ministry said the slow recovery was due to shifting spending from shopping to cultural experiences. South Korea has also made it easier for digital nomads to stay and work in the country, implementing its \u201cworkation\u201d visa at the start of this year. The government is considering to expand the scheme so that remote workers can also indulge in tourism while working in the country. While the latest announcements are a critical step towards further opening up South Korea to international workers, some experts believe these visas could eventually increase the workforce and ease its demographic crisis in a country that has the lowest fertility rate worldwide.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/south-korea-kpop-visa-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}

{"id": "travel_chinese-food-evolution-french-polynesia", "text": "It\u2019s a cloudless morning and the sun is shining brightly off the coast of French Polynesia\u2019s capital and largest city, Papeete, enhancing the water\u2019s already vibrant shades of blue. Though just meters away from the territory\u2019s largest commercial port, cruise ship terminal and airport, the water is clean and clear, amplified by the presence of kaleidoscopic coral and a diverse array of marine creatures. My spearfishing guide is scouring the coral reefs for anything that might make for a delicious meal, but I\u2019m hoping we catch some tuna, mackerel or parrotfish to make\u00a0poisson cru \u00e0 la chinoise,\u00a0a Chinese take on French Polynesia\u2019s national dish, poisson cru au lait de coco\u00a0(lime-marinated raw fish with coconut milk). Both versions of the national dish are as ubiquitous as they are delicious, but the popularity of the chinoise version poses an interesting question: How did Chinese food become one of this French territory\u2019s favorite cuisines? Forging new lives, thousands of miles from home According to historical accounts, the first group of Chinese immigrants, primarily of the Hakka and Punti ethnicities, arrived in French Polynesia in 1865. The majority were brought from China\u2019s Guangdong province to work on a cotton plantation in Atimaono, located on the south side of French Polynesia\u2019s main island, Tahiti. But in 1873, the owner of the plantation died; just one year later, his cotton company went bankrupt. Being more than 11,000 kilometers from home and having little money, many of those Chinese workers remained in French Polynesia to forge new lives. Some continued farming on the defunct plantation, others opened small shops and eateries throughout the archipelago. From these humble beginnings, the Chinese population has grown to become an integral part of French Polynesa\u2019s business sector. Chinese is now the country\u2019s second-largest ethnic group, accounting for more than 10% of the overseas territory\u2019s population. Early on, Chinese cooks had to adapt to what was available in French Polynesia, utilizing more fresh seafood, fruits like coconut and breadfruit, and staples like taro instead of rice. Soy and oyster sauces, along with other ingredients needed for more complex Chinese cooking, would become more readily available only with later waves of immigration from China in the early to mid-1900s, says an article in the Journal of Pacific History. This relatively slow pace of culinary evolution would also give local Tahitians\u2019 palates more time to become accustomed to more flavorful food; before the Chinese arrived, Tahitian cuisine was very simple and predominantly seasoned with just a few ingredients, such as salt, pepper, lime, onions and coconut milk. It\u2019s hard to picture exactly what early Tahitian-Chinese food may have looked like or tasted like, especially with\u00a0the prevalence of Chinese ingredients on grocery store shelves today. Thankfully, one relic of early Chinese-Tahitian cooking has stood the test of time. Ma\u2019a Tinito, literally meaning \u201cChinese food\u201d in the Tahitian language, is also the name of a dish that\u2019s considered one of the region\u2019s earliest Chinese culinary creations. According to research by the Sinitong Association, which oversees the local Chinese cultural associations of French Polynesia, it was invented by a Chinese kitchen assistant in the tiny district of Atimaono. The story goes that the cook, short on ingredients, had to improvise to quickly satiate the hungry stomachs of the area\u2019s plantation workers. In his storeroom, he found red beans and salted pork, and then to add a bit of color to the dish, he fetched some bok choy (Chinese cabbage) and long beans from the vegetable garden. Curious locals asked the workers, \u201cWhat are you eating?\u201d The workers replied: \u201cMa\u2019a Tinito!\u201d (Chinese food!) Easy to cook, cheap, delicious and easily adaptable, the dish, and its name, were here to stay. An extra dose of sweetness A surefire way to immerse yourself not only in the flavors, but also in the culture of Chinese-Tahitian cuisine, is to sign up for a food tour. \u201cOur Chinese food is about family and friends,\u201d says Orama Mollimard, founder of the local food tour and travel company Tahiti With Me. \u201cIt\u2019s something that is meant to be shared and appreciated with everyone at the table.\u201d Having had almost two years of experience as a food tour guide, Orama decided to found her own company in 2024, so that she could share her favorite eats with new friends from around the world. Her Papeete food tour highlights Chinese-Tahitian snacks as an ode to her own Chinese-Tahitian heritage. Hungry foodies can look forward to a few of Orama\u2019s personal favorites, such as steamed chicken rice balls, Chinese-style fish beignets and plum-powdered mangoes. When trying one of Orama\u2019s recommended versions of\u00a0poisson cru \u00e0 la chinoise, those familiar with how raw fish is served in China might draw some connections between the two. Y\u00fash\u0113ng, meaning \u201craw fish\u201d in Chinese, is a popular yet relatively simple dish that generally consists of raw fish slices and an accompanying savory, sour and sometimes spicy sauce. This delicacy has been eaten for thousands of years in China, and has been brought by the Chinese diasporas to all parts of the globe. One can easily imagine Chinese immigrants in the late 1800s or early 1900s experimenting with different combinations of flavors and fish, eventually leading them to create a sweet, sour and savory Chinese-inspired version of\u00a0poisson cru. Tuna, julienned carrots and turnips, cucumber, onions, garlic and ginger, mixed with a beautiful dressing of lemon or lime juice, sugar, salt, pepper, sunflower oil and rice vinegar \u2013 a simple yet delicious manifestation of Chinese-Tahitian fusion that pays heed and compliment to the national dish. While not all poisson cru \u00e0 la chinoise recipes require the addition of sugar, French Polynesia\u2019s collective sweet tooth deems it unthinkable to exclude it. \u201cOur cooks make the dishes slightly sweeter than they would be normally to appeal to local tastes,\u201d says Karl Chung-Tan, second-generation owner of the Restaurant Golden Lake on the island of Mo\u2019orea. This extends to other dishes. For example, the classic Cantonese roast suckling pig is given a unique twist here: instead of being served with a yellow mustard dipping sauce as it is in Hong Kong or Guangzhou, it\u2019s paired with a side of lush and velvety coconut milk. Dishes like these make it clear French Polynesia\u2019s chefs aren\u2019t attempting to simply mirror their counterparts in China. By embracing local ingredients and tastes, as well as traditional Chinese techniques and flavors, they are able to create an even more uniquely delicious and innovative synthesis. Globalization has made accessing once hard-to-find ingredients relatively easy, and while authenticity has its charm, the evolution of Chinese-Tahitian fusion in French Polynesia makes for a rare and exciting culinary story. Ready to experience it first-hand? Below is a selection of restaurants throughout French Polynesia serving excellent Chinese-Tahitian food, along with recommended dishes to try. Tahiti Restaurant Le Dahlia (Arue) It was only appropriate that Restaurant Le Dahlia was my first introduction to Chinese-Tahitian cuisine. Opened in 1972, it\u2019s the oldest continuously operating Chinese restaurant in Tahiti. Their suckling pig with coconut milk is truly outstanding. Their steamed black bean parrotfish is said to be a must-try, but diners need to call a few days in advance to order it. Chez Mei (Papeete) I\u2019m not sure how many times one must eat\u00a0poisson cru\u00a0to be considered a connoisseur - but of the seven or eight times I enjoyed the dish throughout my recent trip, Chez Mei\u2019s\u00a0version\u00a0stood head and shoulders above the rest. Papeete Sunday Market The Papeete Sunday Market is the beating heart of French Polynesia\u2019s capital city. All kinds of goodies are available for purchase: wild-caught whole tunas, locally grown fruit and vegetables, freshly baked pain au chocolates and croissants,\u00a0poisson cru\u00a0by the pound, and even pearls and other souvenirs. Yet where the market really shines is its incredible array of Chinese dim sum (snack) offerings. While all these recommended dim sum dishes are of Chinese origin, some might be best known by a name in one of four languages: Tahitian, French, Hakka or Cantonese. As such, the corresponding local name for each item is listed. Embrace your inner polyglot and get snacking! \u2013 Chao pao (steamed stuffed buns)\u2013 Nems (spring rolls)\u2013 Bouchons/Siu Mai (steamed dumplings with pork, shrimp or chicken)\u2013 Samoussas (fried wontons)\u2013 Lopepan (white glutinous rice dumplings, filled with turnip, chicken and pepper)\u2013 Founpan (red glutinous rice dumplings, filled with brown sugar and crushed peanuts) The market opens at about 4 a.m. and tourists are advised to get there early. When I arrived at 4:15 a.m. it was already humming with activity; there was a line 20-30 people deep to grab a few slices of one vendor\u2019s famous Pua\u2019a Roti (Cantonese-style barbecue roast pork). Mo\u2019orea Restaurant Golden Lake (Temae) While not on the regular menu at Golden Lake, insiders can ask for a family-style portion of Ma\u2019a Tinito to be cooked to order. The mainstays of the dish are its thick, sweet and salty brown sauce and large chunks of tender pork, yet almost every other element is fungible; it\u2019s the perfect dish to cook at home when you\u2019re in a pinch. Versions of the dish vary as widely today as they probably did in the 1800s, as beans, macaroni, Chinese cabbage, taro, or rice noodles can be added as the chef desires. Traditionally, the dish was served with banana, yet today, locals more commonly enjoy it with rice or bread. Bora Bora Le Panda D\u2019Or (Vaitape) Le Panda D\u2019or is the only privately operated Chinese restaurant in Bora Bora. Located in Vaitape, Bora Bora\u2019s main city, travelers will likely pass by it on their way to or from a jet ski tour, shark and ray cruise, or when shuttling between different resorts, thus making it an easy lunch stop on the way to their next destination. Their shrimp-stuffed fish did not disappoint. Resorts At Bora Bora\u2019s world-famous resorts, the\u00a0executive\u00a0chefs and their teams are continually pushing the boundaries of Chinese-Tahitian fusion. The three following resorts I visited all expressed a strong incentive to develop new dishes to keep offerings exciting for their discerning guests. Bamboo (St. Regis Bora Bora) A favorite at this St. Regis Bora Bora restaurant is the\u00a0caramelized pork stir fry. The good-sized, ever-so-slightly fatty pieces of pork are crisped to perfection, and the addition of purple and green cabbage, onions and carrots made the dish visually appetizing. The portions are reasonable so you\u2019ll most likely have room for dessert. The Cocoriander is a must-try \u2013 provided you like coriander. The chocolate \u201ccoconut shell\u201d has freshly made coconut sorbet inside, which can be paired with as much or as little of the side of coriander cream as you please. Although coriander is certainly not an ingredient exclusive to Chinese cuisine, it\u2019s often used for flavoring and/or garnish in China, making the dish stand out as a beautiful example of innovative Chinese-Tahitian fusion. Banyan (Conrad Bora Bora) A modern Chinese restaurant, Banyan offers a local adaptation of a traditional Cantonese dish. Its lovingly hand-crafted Siu Mai (steamed pork and shrimp dumplings) are the five-star version of what you can find at the vibrant Sunday Market in Papeete. They can be enjoyed as presented, but feel free to ask the server for some vinegar or chili paste if you\u2019d like to try them as\u00a0dumplings are sometimes\u00a0eaten in China. All of the fish and shellfish at Banyan is locally sourced and that includes the signature wok-fried spiny lobster. Dishes are served in family-style portions, so expect a gracious amount of lobster meat, covered in a thick yet delicate, home-made XO sauce, a quintessential Hong Kong condiment. Vaimiti (Four Seasons Bora Bora) It\u2019s hard not to have high expectations of the food after seeing this restaurant\u2019s setting. Vaimiti, perched above idyllic cyan waters and pristine white sands, commands incredible views of Mount Otemanu and what might be the world\u2019s most beautiful beach. A menu mainstay of nearly two years here is the Hunan-style Mahi Mahi. \u201cHunan-style\u201d usually suggests a fiery heat, yet this dish has been made more appealing to guests from around the world with chilis that lend a sweet, rather than spicy, note.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/chinese-food-evolution-french-polynesia/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_bird-strike-plane-what-happens", "text": "Late Monday night, Virgin Australia flight VA 148 set out from Queenstown in New Zealand bound for Melbourne. Not long after takeoff, the right engine of the Boeing 737-800 jet started\u00a0emitting loud bangs, followed by flames. The pilot flew on with the remaining engine, bringing the plane\u2019s 73 passengers and crew to a safe emergency landing at nearby Invercargill airport. Virgin Australia says the dramatic turn of events was caused by a \u201cpossible bird strike\u201d. Queenstown Airport\u00a0played down\u00a0the likelihood of bird strike, saying \u201cno birds were detected on the airfield at that time\u201d. While we don\u2019t know exactly what happened, bird strike is a common and real risk for aircraft. It can damage planes, and even lead to deaths. How common are bird strikes? A bird strike is a\u00a0collision between\u00a0an aircraft and a bird. (Though the definition is sometimes expanded to include\u00a0collisions on the ground\u00a0with land animals including deer, rabbits, dogs and alligators.) The\u00a0first bird strike\u00a0was recorded by Orville Wright in 1905, over a cornfield in Ohio. Now they happen every day, with some seasonal variability due to the\u00a0migratory patterns\u00a0of birds. Perhaps the most famous migratory bird strike occurred in 2009, when\u00a0US Airways Flight 1549\u00a0encountered a flock of migrating Canadian geese shortly after taking off from LaGuardia Airport in New York. Both of the plane\u2019s engines failed, and captain Sully Sullenberger was forced to pilot it to an unpowered landing in the Hudson River. Between 2008 and 2017, the Australian Transport Safety Board recorded\u00a016,626 bird strikes. In America, the Federal Aviation Administration reported\u00a017,200 bird strikes\u00a0in 2022 alone. Where do bird strikes happen, and what are the effects? According to the\u00a0International Civil Aviation Organization, 90% of bird strikes happen near airports. In general, this is while aircraft are taking off or landing, or flying at lower altitudes where most bird activity occurs. The effect of bird strike depends on many factors including the type of aircraft. Outcomes may include shutting down an engine, as may have happened with the Virgin Australia flight. This plane was a Boeing 737-800, which has the capability to fly on a single engine to an alternate airport. In smaller aircraft, particularly single-engine aircraft, bird strikes can be fatal. Since 1988,\u00a0262 bird strike fatalities\u00a0have been reported globally, and 250 aircraft destroyed. How do manufacturers and pilots defend against bird strike? Most\u00a0bird strikes\u00a0occur early in the morning or a sunset when birds are most active. Pilots are trained to be vigilant during these times. Radar can be used to\u00a0track flocks of birds. However, this technology is ground-based and not available worldwide so it can\u2019t be used everywhere. The two largest manufacturers of passenger jets, Boeing and Airbus, use\u00a0turbofan engines. These use a series of fan blades to compress air before adding fuel and flame to get the thrust needed to take off. Bird strike in one of these engines can cause severe damage to the fan blades, causing the engine to fail. Engine manufacturers test the safety of these engines by firing\u00a0a high-speed frozen chicken\u00a0at them while the engine is operating at full thrust. The Australian Government\u2019s Civil Aviation Safety Authority\u00a0circular on wildlife hazard management\u00a0outlines what airports should do to keep birds and animals away from the vicinity of the airport. One technique is to use small gas explosions to mimic the sound of a shotgun to deter birds from loitering near the runway. In areas with high bird populations, airports may also use certain grasses and plants that do not attract the birds.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/bird-strike-plane-what-happens/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_airline-passenger-tracks-missing-bag-felony-theft", "text": "A Florida man is facing a felony grand theft charge in Broward County after a plucky airline passenger scheduled to fly out of Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in March tracked her stolen luggage to the man\u2019s home, according to the probable cause affidavit in the case. Junior Geneus Bazile, 29, of Fort Lauderdale has been charged with grand theft in the third degree. The victim was slated to leave the airport on a Spirit Airlines flight the evening of March 3, but the airline canceled the flight and told all passengers they could retrieve their checked luggage on the baggage belt at Terminal 4, the affidavit said. Paola Garcia told CNN affiliate WPLG in Miami that she usually takes her suitcase onboard, but this time, she was told she had to check it. Garcia said waited at least two hours for her pink roller bag, which contained an Apple MacBook, Apple iPad, Apple Watch, jewelry, high-end woman\u2019s clothing and toiletries. It never came out on the luggage belt. In her WPLG interview, Garcia said that Spirit Airlines told her that her luggage had been sent to her house. The luggage never came. But Garcia explored another avenue with her own electronic tracker. Garcia, not named in the affidavit, later pinged the electronic items inside the bag to try and locate them, and the ping showed them at an address in Fort Lauderdale, the affidavit said. Tracking down her luggage She then went to retrieve her things from the address, but she couldn\u2019t contact anyone inside the home, the affidavit said. While at the house, she took video and still pictures, where she saw \u201cseveral pieces of luggage in the front of the home,\u201d none of which were her own, the affidavit said. Garcia told WPLG that she dialed 911. \u201cThe first thing I remember the police told me is: \u2018What are you doing here? This is so dangerous for you to be here.\u2019 \u201c When a detective with the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office searched the address within the airport\u2019s employee databases, he found that Bazile reportedly lived at the address. Bazile was listed as working at a Paradies Lagard\u00e8re Travel Retail store at the airport and was working on the day of the theft, according to the affidavit. The store\u2019s loss prevention manager was contacted, and he provided the detective with internal CCTV footage from the day of the incident, which allegedly showed Bazile entering the store\u2019s storage room with a pink shell roller bag, matching the description of the stolen bag, and rummaging through the luggage, the affidavit said. \u00a0He then appeared to take the MacBook and other smaller items out of the luggage and put\u00a0them in other bags.

{"id": "2024_06_19_travel_barf-bag-collectors-hobby-cec", "text": "\u201cI collect barf bags\u201d is not a complete sentence. The grammar is there, but it demands further explanation. To make sense\u00a0of this singular hobby,\u00a0a \u201cbecause\u201d or a charitable \u201cand\u201d\u00a0is needed to\u00a0steer listeners through the bewilderment of hearing that set of words, arranged in that way, for the very first time. \u201cI collect barf bags because they\u2019re pretty neat.\u201d \u201cI collect barf bags, and I\u2019m not the only one.\u201d Of the eight billion people on the planet, the number of serious barf bag collectors is just north of 100, according to notable members of their ranks. Not statistically significant, but significantly more than one might guess. A handful of these collectors are taking part in \u201cThe Last Barf Bag,\u201d a new campaign by Dramamine \u2014 yes, the nausea relief medicine \u2014 to celebrate this most necessary of inventions with a 13-minute documentary and a barf bag exhibit in New York City. There, hundreds of specimens chart the evolution of the aviation industry. For some collectors, it\u2019s serious business. Right now, in barely hidden corners of the internet, barf bags are being purchased and traded in a commerce as foreign to most people as the phrase, \u201cI collect barf bags.\u201d The community, small as it is, has formed its own etiquette and occasionally fizzes with a bit of drama. Friendships have been forged over this hobby, and the lore \u2014 oh, it is startlingly rich in detail. But it\u2019s barf bags, after all. And if you\u2019re going to be part of this scene, you have to have a really good sense of humor. The ineffable why When Steve Silberburg started collecting barf bags around 1981, he thought he would be the only one. He was wrong, but it was an understandable assumption. \u201cWhen you\u2019re young, you go, \u2018Oh I\u2019m going to collect something.\u2019 But stamps and coins, everybody collects those,\u201d the computer programmer and Maine native told CNN. After dabbling with collections of sardine keys and styrofoam weights, Silberburg spotted inspiration in a seatback pocket on a cross-country flight from Boston to San Francisco. \u201cNobody collects these,\u201d he remembers thinking. \u201cThis is what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d Silberburg was in college at the time and thought it would be amusing to hang the barf bag outside the door of his room in his fraternity house. People were indeed amused, but it had an unintended side effect: Classmates started bringing Silberburg other barf bags to add to his collection. When the internet became widely available in the mid-\u201990s, Silberburg said it was like a whole new world opened up. He connected with other collectors, and the pastime took off in earnest. Eli Cox, a collector from Austin, Texas, can also blame academia for abetting his hobby. The business professor told CNN he got a portion of his 370-bag collection from students he knew during his teaching days. \u201cIt\u2019s been a surprise to me, over the years, to get bags that were mailed from students who had graduated 10 or 20 years earlier, but somehow remembered what I was doing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has been a way of connecting people and generating some laughter. So that\u2019s really been fun.\u201d Fun, Cox says, is the whole point. \u201cIt\u2019s a dopamine producer. When I tell people about it, they first ask if they understood me properly, and then they laugh. And I think there\u2019s a dopamine shortage and a laughter shortage in the world right now.\u201d Around the world in barf bags The barf bag is such a specific artifact of human advancement. Consider all that had to be accomplished in order for it to exist: the triumph of aviation, the incomprehensible global infrastructure of commercial flight, and finally, the neat trick of inventing something people can throw up in that isn\u2019t too threatening to keep close by. Bob Grove, a former general counsel from San Diego, came to barf bag collecting through his larger passion for travel. Hundreds of framed bags line the walls of his home, to the dismay of his (very understanding) interior designer wife. Like many collectors, a lot of his favorite acquisitions carry a story. There was the time he and fellow collector Bruce Kelly took a shuttle across the border to a Tijuana airport to see if they could get bags from the domestic Mexican airlines. Thanks to some very accommodating airport staff, they ended up with a haul. \u201cSometimes, people don\u2019t want to help you, but at that airport people couldn\u2019t have been nicer or more accommodating. It was unbelievable,\u201d he said. Grove says some of his most sought-after bags are from small airlines, defunct airlines and regions of the world that don\u2019t see as much international travel. The particularities of the airline industry play a factor, too. Grove recalls when the government-owned Chinese airline CAAC was broken up into dozens of different domestic airlines, resulting in a new crop of unique barf bags. Those are some of his favorites because of the quality and attention to detail: beautifully illustrated cherry trees, sturdy construction and, in one case, a design scheme best viewed from the perspective of, well, someone actively using it.\u00a0 \u201cWhen you collect, you can see the history of the graphic design as well,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cYou can see designs change over the years, and the graphics that are on the domestic Chinese airlines are among the best in the world.\u201d Bruce Kelly, Grove\u2019s friend who convinced him to take the jaunt to Tijuana, shares his love of travel. The inciting incident in his barf bag history was a backpacking trip to Burma (now Myanmar) in 1976, when he kept a bag on a whim because of its cool Burmese script. Years later he dug it out and started to wonder what else it could awaken. \u201cI\u2019ve spent many a time on international flights staring at the seat back in front of me, and eventually I thought, wouldn\u2019t it be interesting to collect barf bags?\u201d Kelly said, the fateful assumption barrelling down like a high-speed train: \u201cI\u2019m sure no one else has ever thought of it. I\u2019ll have the only collection in the world.\u201d He may not have the only collection, but at roughly 8,000 bags, it\u2019s definitely one of the biggest. Kelly also runs Kelly\u2019s World of Airsickness Bags, an online catalog of his collection, with some specimens for sale. \u201cI try to list all the history of each airline that I collected from,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, you know, it became a history thing, and somebody\u2019s got to preserve that history before it\u2019s lost forever.\u201d An invention of necessity The invention of the barf bag is widely credited to American inventor Gilmore Schjeldahl. The native North Dakotan was an industrial design giant who specialized in bags and plastic linings and, in 1949, created a harmonious union of the two: a discreet, plastic-lined bag for motion sickness. The term barf bag sounds so undignified, but the alternatives aren\u2019t much of an improvement. \u201cComfort bag\u201d is cloaked in euphemism. \u201cSickness bag\u201d lacks charm. The scientifically sanitized \u201cemesis bag,\u201d perhaps too formal for the occasion. (Try to eke out \u201cExcuse me, I fear I require an emesis bag,\u201d and the moment may be upon you \u2014 or your lap \u2014 before you finish.) Barf bag it is, then. Evocative and memorable; a bit like a good barf bag itself. When asked about their favorite barf bags, the collectors CNN spoke to all had slightly different answers. One thing they agreed upon, however, was the barfing reindeer. \u201cOne of the favorites of probably every collector has to be a bag from a domestic Finnish airline called Finn Aviation, which has since been absorbed into the national carrier FinAir,\u201d Bob Grove explained. \u201cTheir logo was a reindeer, and their barf bag was the logo, but the reindeer was barfing ice cubes. It\u2019s very Scandinavian minimalist. Simple, but you know exactly what the meaning is, right?\u201d The barfing reindeer is a good reminder that these receptacles have a very practical application outside of being kept in vinyl sleeves or displayed in New York City galleries. Steve Silberburg recalls having to make use of a barf bag while fighting sinus problems on a flight from Omaha to St. Louis. (His exact words were \u201cI threw up on a TWA flight once.\u201d) It was a double whammy: TWA no longer exists, so there\u2019s a piece of history. And all things considered, your most memorable barf bag is probably the one you have to use. \u201cI must say that the bag worked quickly, and I was amazed at how neat the whole experience was,\u201d he said. Sadly, people don\u2019t barf on planes like they used to. The collectors lament that barf bags are now a dying art, absent from many large carriers and often lacking the je ne sais quoi of the nauseated past, when air travel was new and bags were fixtures in the seatback pockets. \u201cThe airlines have gotten much smoother, so you don\u2019t get sick on flights anymore,\u201d Bruce Kelly said. \u201cWho knows, maybe Dramamine has helped.\u201d On a different plane Barf bags are all around you, if you have the desire to look. Some collectors have expanded their acquisitions outside the world of air sickness bags to, well, any kind of sickness bag at all. Kelly, who maintains the extensive online barf bag catalog, also collects bags from boats, trains, buses \u2014 wherever people may puke. For Silberburg, some of his coolest bags aren\u2019t from any type of transportation at all. (Although one from a space shuttle certainly ranks high in his collection.) \u201cI have bags from elections, political events. I have bags celebrating royal weddings and the Diamond Jubilee in England. I even have some from banks. I don\u2019t remember offhand how I got those, but their marketing departments must have had a great week.\u201d Silberburg, a confessed \u201ccomputer weenie,\u201d is also partial to the ones passed out at video game conventions, and even has one themed to the famed computer game Roller Coaster Tycoon. \u201cSome collectors are purists,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I collect them all.\u201d Listening to the collectors describe their barf bag collecting experiences, one gets a sense of the larger community. There are collectors in Japan and Europe, some of whom attract envy from American collectors who don\u2019t get to travel as often or have as many air carrier options in their region. Then, there are unofficial agreements among traders that can get a little strained. One collector described the \u201cone for one\u201d rule of thumb, which some collectors try to abuse to get rare bags in exchange for several more common ones. Such is life in a community, even one as niche as barf bag collecting. \u201cWe all know each other, all over the world. We keep in touch with each other,\u201d says Kelly. \u201cWe don\u2019t want anybody to get ahead of us, you know.\u201d \u201cIt makes a good litmus test, telling people you collect barf bags,\u201d Silberburg says. \u201cIf people think it\u2019s cool, those are people I\u2019d typically get along with. But if they say, \u2018Oh, gross,\u2019 I probably don\u2019t need to know them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/travel/barf-bag-collectors-hobby-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_article_chance-encounters-florence-italy-kacie-rose", "text": "Kacie Rose Burns walked into the Florence jazz bar, alone. \u201cI\u2019ll go for one song and suss it out,\u201d she thought, trying to quieten her nerves. Kacie slipped in at the back. The club was dark and busy, a few wall lights and neon signs illuminating people drinking, dancing and chatting. Before she could even take in the musicians on stage, Kacie\u2019s eyes landed on a tall man sitting at the bar. \u201cI walked in and he was there,\u201d Kacie tells CNN Travel today. \u201cWe clocked eyes.\u201d \u201cCiao,\u201d said the stranger, smiling. \u201cCiao,\u201d Kacie said back, before adding apologetically: \u201cThat\u2019s all the Italian I\u2019ve got for you.\u201d It was October 2018. Kacie was a 24-year-old New Yorker on vacation in Florence. It was her first time in Italy and her first time traveling solo. It was an exciting \u2013 and terrifying \u2013 experience. \u201cI was a professional dancer in New York,\u201d explains Kacie. \u201cA very exhausting career \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of toxicity, a lot of rejection, there\u2019s a lot of politics that come into play \u2013 and I was feeling a little stuck, a little unhappy, a little \u2013 just stagnant, if you will.\u201d Kacie spent her days auditioning, traveling for gigs and moonlighting at a clothing store. She needed a break, and she\u2019d long felt a \u201cpull\u201d to Italy and dreamed of an Italian vacation. \u201cI kept saying, \u2018I\u2019ll wait for somebody to go with, I\u2019ll wait, I\u2019ll wait. And then I was waiting for years. And so then one night \u2013 at two in the morning \u2013 I was like, \u2018What am I waiting for? Life is too short.\u2019 So I booked a solo trip to Italy.\u201d Kacie planned to spend the majority of her time in Rome and Venice and just a couple of days in Florence. But in the lead-up to the trip, she got chatting to a customer at the store she worked at. This woman had lived in Florence for five years and sung the Tuscan city\u2019s praises, persuading Kacie to add an extra day to her Florence stint. And that\u2019s how Kacie and the Italian stranger happened to be in the jazz club on the same evening. \u201cI\u2019m really glad that I listened to her,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cThat\u2019s the only reason why we met on the first night that I was in Florence, on that earlier day that I wasn\u2019t originally supposed to be there.\u201d A Florence meeting The man Kacie crossed paths with in the jazz bar was 26-year-old Dario Nencetti, a chef in a Florence hotel who usually worked nights. It just so happened that was the only evening he had off that week. The jazz bar, called Jazz Club Firenze, was one of Dario\u2019s favorite hangouts. He loved the music, the underground ambiance and the fact the bar encouraged punters to sign up for jam sessions. \u201cThat place is, let\u2019s say, unconventional for Florence,\u201d Dario tells CNN Travel. \u201cUsually in Florence, there\u2019s like a table for two or three or four people. In the jazz club, there are big tables, so you can sit with strangers and stuff, which I love.\u201d When Dario realized Kacie didn\u2019t know much Italian beyond \u201cciao,\u201d they switched to English. Dario told Kacie he\u2019d lived in Scotland for a year, and they got talking about travel. Kacie mentioned she was on her first solo trip and Dario said he\u2019d embarked on a similar adventure to Japan earlier that year. \u201cWe bonded from the beginning,\u201d says Dario. \u201cIt was really natural, really easy conversation.\u201d \u201cI remember he made me laugh,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Oh, this guy\u2019s interesting.\u201d So many people ask us, \u2018How did you know?\u2019 And I don\u2019t know how I knew. I was just like, \u2018Oh, this is something different.\u2019\u201d Kacie and Dario stayed at the jazz bar talking into the early hours of the morning. Then they spent as much time as possible together over the next two days. \u201cHe would meet me after his work \u2013 every night he got off at 11. And we would go out and we would just talk,\u201d recalls Kacie. \u201cI instantly fell in love with Florence. It\u2019s a very romantic city - cobblestone streets and medieval buildings. It looks like a painting everywhere you look.\u201d It was a whirlwind two days. One evening they sat by Florence\u2019s Ponte Vecchio bridge and talked until 3 or 4 a.m. It was as though Kacie was in a film \u2013 somewhere between every millennial\u2019s favorite \u201cThe Lizzie McGuire Movie\u201d and classic Florentine romance \u201cA Room with a View.\u201d Then, the two days were up and Kacie had to continue onto the next leg of her trip. It was still like something from a movie \u2013 only it wasn\u2019t obvious this one had a happy ending. \u201cI got on the train and he was standing on the platform. And I remember looking out the train, and I was so sad,\u201d she says. As the train pulled away from the station, Kacie wiped away tears and messaged her best friend back home in New York. \u201cI just met my future husband in Florence,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s the guy I\u2019m gonna marry. I\u2019m never gonna see him again.\u201d Her friend tried to cheer her up. \u201cYou\u2019re going to Rome,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYou\u2019ll meet a gladiator!\u201d But Kacie knew what she had with Dario wasn\u2019t replaceable. \u201cWe never stopped talking. We FaceTimed every single day,\u201d she says. This continued when Kacie was back in the US. And before long, Dario was planning a trip to visit New York. A New York minute On December 8, 2018 Dario arrived in the US. Kacie spent a week introducing Dario to her life in New York. \u201cIt was really cool to see it through his eyes,\u201d she says. \u201cShe showed me the real city,\u201d says Dario. Then the couple flew to Miami for a week\u2019s vacation. For Kacie and Dario, there was never a specific moment where they decided to embark on a relationship. \u201cIt was never a decision to be made,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cIt just went without saying,\u201d agrees Dario. \u201cBut I can\u2019t hide it, long distance was hard.\u201d The two struggled with time zones and their busy jobs that left them with little downtime, but tried to visit each other whenever they could. Cut to September 2019. Dario was back in New York visiting Kacie. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I move here?\u201d he suggested. He\u2019d loved the vibrancy of the city from the get-go and could see himself there. The restaurant scene was incredible. If he could find a job and organize the visa, it seemed like the ideal scenario. Kacie thought so too, so Dario started asking around. He was eventually hired as a chef at an Italian restaurant in Brooklyn. After a couple of months in limbo, his visa was approved. \u201cUp until that point, every time that we had to say goodbye it was borderline traumatic \u2013 we had spent this week together and we knew that this was it for each other,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cSaying goodbye in airports sucked. It would take like a week to recover.\u201d But now the airport goodbyes were consigned to the past. \u201cIt was really exciting,\u201d says Dario. Moving forward together Kacie and Dario spent three months in New York together, giddy with happiness to be in the same country and the same city. Then the pandemic hit. New York City\u2019s performing arts and restaurant industries ground to a halt. Stuck at home, Kacie and Dario found solace and support in one another. As Kacie puts it, she and Dario found \u201cmany silver linings\u201d in this tough time. Dario taught Kacie how to make pasta. They cat-sat. They spent long evenings chatting. But as 2020 rolled on, the couple were aware there was a deadline hanging over them. Dario\u2019s visa was set to run out in December and in the wake of the pandemic, renewal was out of the question. For Kacie and Dario, it seemed like there were only three viable choices: return to long distance, get married or move to Italy. Going back to long distance would mean the return of those airport goodbyes, the last thing either of them wanted. And while Kacie and Dario thought marriage was in their future, they didn\u2019t feel it was right for them at that point. That left moving to Italy. Kacie thought about her career in New York. Performing was off the table and there was no return date in sight. And while her friends were regularly posting on social media about how much they missed dancing, Kacie only felt \u201crelief\u201d that her days were no longer defined by auditioning and uncertainty. \u201cThat was a pretty big wake-up call,\u201d she says. \u201cI had gotten to a point where I needed to take a little step back from performing.\u201d On top of this, Kacie\u2019s New York apartment lease was up. If there was ever a time to relocate to Italy, it was now. \u201cEverything kind of fell into place,\u201d she says. Kacie researched online and found a language academy in Florence offering study visas. She applied, enrolling in Italian lessons. Then, Kacie and Dario packed up their life in New York and got ready to move across the Atlantic. Before stepping on the plane in January 2021, Kacie posted a video to TikTok about meeting Dario and the move to Italy. She\u2019d never posted much on the platform before, but felt inspired to mark this significant life step. When she stepped off the plane and connected to Wi-Fi, her cell phone was blowing up. \u201cIt went viral,\u201d says Kacie. While stuck inside during mandatory two-week quarantine, Kacie continued posting TikTok videos. Her following continued to grow. While her social media presence was getting bigger, for the first few months in Florence, Kacie and Dario\u2019s IRL world remained small. Italy was still in the thrall of Covid, with strict restrictions. But as Kacie studied for her Italian lessons and taught English online and Dario looked for restaurant work, Florence started to slowly reopen. \u201cI remember the first time going to the Duomo. And there was nobody there,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cWhich is crazy, because it\u2019s like the main focus point of Florence. And there\u2019s nobody in the piazza and I remember how bizarre that was.\u201d While that moment was surreal \u2013 even sad \u2013 Kacie and Dario still felt grateful to be at the Florentine landmark together. They\u2019d come a long way, and they were excited for their new life together in Italy. Acclimatizing to Italian life was made easier for Kacie by Dario\u2019s family, who welcomed her wholeheartedly \u2013 even if, in the early days, Kacie struggled with Italian and Dario\u2019s mother didn\u2019t know much English. The two women made communication work by using Google Translate on their cell phones. \u201cThey bonded immediately,\u201d says Dario. Kacie continued to post on social media, and her following ballooned. After about six months, she stopped teaching English online and decided to do social media full time. Dario encouraged this step. \u201cI think it was a really good idea diving into it,\u201d he says today. \u201cIt was the right moment, the right time, and I believed in her from the first moment.\u201d A life together in Italy Almost four years later, Kacie\u2019s expanded her social media presence into a travel company, running group tours around Italy and publishing her own travel guides. Meanwhile, Dario is still passionate about cooking and now works as a fine dining chef at a Florence restaurant. \u201cI really love the life we\u2019ve created here,\u201d says Kacie. \u201cWe live in a beautiful place with great food and he\u2019s got so many awesome things going for him and same with me.\u201d The couple encourage each other in their respective careers and endeavors, but they also savor their downtime. They love living in Florence and exploring Italy together. Dario and Kacie are settled in Florence for now, although they don\u2019t rule out a move elsewhere in the future. \u201cWe\u2019re enjoying the moment,\u201d says Dario. \u201cThe solid thing is the fact that we know we\u2019re in it together. And that\u2019s what makes it so great,\u201d says Kacie. She tells Dario: \u201cI\u2019m not nervous for what the future holds. Because I\u2019ve got you.\u201d Looking back, Kacie finds it serendipitous and surreal to think her spontaneous decision to travel solo in Italy led her to find a new career, a new home and the love of her life. \u201cThere were so many things that had to happen for it to actually happen, but it just felt normal and natural \u2013 like of course this is right and this was supposed to happen,\u201d she says. \u201cYou never really know what life has planned for you. There\u2019s so many good things waiting. You just have to trust it,\u201d adds Kacie. \u201cTrust in the process. And the path that is meant for you will happen, even if it\u2019s not the path that you intended to take for yourself.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/article/chance-encounters-florence-italy-kacie-rose/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_harry-styles-holmes-chapel-tour", "text": "Before 2010, Holmes Chapel was but another quiet leafy village in northern England. There was the little train station with services to Manchester and Crewe, a handful of local shops and, a short walk out of town, the 180-year-old Twemlow Viaduct on the banks of the River Dane. Then a teenager with dimples and curly hair, who worked part-time at the local bakery, went down to London to audition for \u201cThe X Factor\u201d TV show. That teen was Harry Styles, who became part of bestselling boy band One Direction before scaling new heights with his solo career. Holmes Chapel\u2019s fame began when it appeared in the 2013 One Direction documentary \u201cThis Is Us\u201d and, for Styles\u2019 legions of dedicated fans around the world \u2013 known as \u201cHarries\u201d \u2013 his youthful haunts were anointed as new shrines on a pop pilgrimage. The prime destination is the viaduct, where the pop star had his first kiss and, in the documentary, wrote his name on the wall in chalk. But, say locals, with an estimated 5,000 international fans visiting the 6,700-population village each year, road safety has become a concern. Harry Styles rescued a baby mole So, a year on from introducing a free map with safe walking routes around the village, the Holmes Chapel Partnership community group has this weekend launched Harry\u2019s Home Village Tour. It\u2019s a leisurely 2.5-to-three-hour stroll around Harry hotspots \u2013 allowing plenty of time for selfies and social content \u2013 guided by trained experts in both local history and Harry lore, some of whom share stories of their brushes with the man himself. \u201cMy favorite Harry Styles memory was when he helped me rescue a baby mole that my cats had brought into the house, and it had burrowed underneath the carpet,\u201d recalls tour guide Jill Booth, 58, who, as a former neighbor with a son the same age, has known Styles since he was a young child. There were 150 applicants for the tour guide roles, many from overseas, and the interview process involved an 80-question quiz on both the star and his home town, as well as a trial presentation at the viaduct. Other guides, such as 21-year-old Isabella Boughey from nearby Stoke-on-Trent, are from the Harry fanbase. As a child, Boughey watched \u201cThe X Factor\u201d with her mother and he\u2019s held a special place in her heart ever since. \u201cI just love how he embodies happiness and positivity,\u201d she tells CNN Travel. \u2018The best job in the world\u2019 The tour starts at Holmes Chapel train station, where station master Graham Blake has for years been welcoming fans who\u2019ve traveled from everywhere from Australia to Mexico and beyond. Blake remembers Styles being at the station weekly as he traveled down to London as he got through the stages of \u201cThe X Factor\u201d reality show. He was a \u201clovely lad,\u201d he recalls. \u201cHe was always ahead with the fashion and everything. He\u2019d wear these jeans with his Calvin Klein boxers and his little bobbly hat.\u201d He shows us the sixth edition of the train station\u2019s visitor book, which is overflowing with heartfelt messages from fans. Harry Styles\u2019 father Des stops by from time to time to pick up the completed books to pass onto his son. Of his role as a mentor to Harry fans, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s made my job the best job in the world now, because I get to meet people from all over the world who come in and have a chat.\u201d The ticket office is bedecked with Harry Styles-themed memorabilia, including a lifesize cutout, and another 2D Harry greets us at W. Mandeville bakery, where staff and customers alike aren\u2019t fazed by the press scrum, plainly accustomed to the village\u2019s new-found fame. In shop windows there are Harry Styles coloring books; bars advertise \u201cWatermelon Sugar\u201d cocktails. It\u2019\u2019d be a tough town for any locals with Styles fatigue. Navigating the English countryside After picking up doughy treats in W. Mandeville, fans have been known to attempt to meander down to the Twemlow Viaduct along the busy A305 road, where cars travel at 50 miles per hour and there are no sidewalks. The safer route, and the one Harry Styles and other local children would have taken, is an idyllic jaunt through green fields and along the river. And on the way to the viaduct, visitors would also do well to have an understanding of the Countryside Code of England and Wales, with its guidance on navigating private land and local livestock. It\u2019s busy at the viaduct while we are there, our tour group clutching the slate hearts we\u2019ve been given to write messages on, to discourage adding to the Harry-inspired graffiti that covers the brickwork. It doesn\u2019t dissuade a herd of cattle from wandering among us, at risk of trampling the blanket upon which fans are sat making friendship bracelets. Friends Phoebe Hodges and Mia Tesolin, both 18, have traveled from Canberra, Australia, to see Harry Styles\u2019 hometown. \u201cI like all the greenery and all the houses,\u201d says Hodges. Tesolin agrees, \u201cThe scenery is definitely really beautiful.\u201d The tour has yet to be officially endorsed by Harry Styles himself, although Peter Whiers, chair of the Holmes Chapel Partnership, tells CNN that they\u2019ve reached out to his management team via his mother. (CNN has also contacted his music label for comment.) This isn\u2019t the first time Whiers has been linked to Styles through road safety. \u201cI probably oversaw his cycling skills when he was about 10,\u201d he says, having been in charge of preparing children from his school for their cycling proficiency test, a national bike safety program. \u2018Messages of love\u2019 One location that the tour doesn\u2019t take in is the newly reopened Fortune City Chinese restaurant, which \u2013 when we peer in through the darkened windows on a Friday afternoon \u2013 resembles any other small-town dining spot. It is, however, where 18-year-old Harry Styles took his then girlfriend, 23-year-old Taylor Swift, for a date way back in 2012. A photo capturing the moment was shared on Twitter at the time, with Styles looking considerably more enthusiastic about the night out than Swift. Whiers tells CNN that the fan base is predominantly girls and young women and that they\u2019re \u201cgenerally very respectful.\u201d \u201cI think, when you look at the messages that they write in Graham\u2019s book at the station and also the messages they leave on the wall, they\u2019re all messages of love,\u201d he says. The Harry Styles song \u201cTreat People with Kindness\u201d has been picked up as a mantra by fans and our tour around Holmes Chapel has been notably wholesome. The price of the tour, \u00a320 ($25), feels steep, but the partnership only introduced it after first producing free walking maps. The tour maps come with discounts to local businesses and they\u2019re hoping for a hot trade in tour t-shirts. From Japan to Austria to the Balearics, there are small communities in revolt against their villages being taken over by tourists. When life gives you lemons, make lemonade. In Holmes Chapel, when life gave them watermelons, they made watermelon sugar.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/harry-styles-holmes-chapel-tour/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_married-southwest-pilots", "text": "On their first flight together, Joel Atkinson and Shelley Atkinson couldn\u2019t contain their excitement. They enthused to the flight attendants. They posed for photos. They told passengers via a pre-flight announcement. \u201cWe made a big deal about it,\u201d Joel tells CNN Travel. Then, right before take off, Joel and Shelley sat side by side in the flight deck, just the two of them. They\u2019d come full circle, and were about to embark on an exciting new chapter. \u201cIt felt amazing,\u201d Shelley tells CNN Travel. \u201cAs we prepared to take off, I was giddy, euphoric,\u201d says Joel. Joel and Shelley met as twentysomethings flying jets in the US Air Force. They became fast friends, then, over time, fell in love. Today, they\u2019ve been married for 27 years and counting. They\u2019ve brought up two kids together. And now they\u2019re both pilots for Southwest Airlines. They regularly fly together, with Joel as captain and Shelley as first officer. The couple say working together is \u201camazing.\u201d They treat layovers as \u201cdate nights.\u201d They learn from one another\u2019s respective \u201cwisdom and judgment.\u201d And no, they don\u2019t argue mid-flight. \u201cPeople ask us, how does it work, flying together?\u201d says Joel. \u201cWe know a few pilot couples and some of them fly together, some of them don\u2019t. I\u2019ve heard people say, \u2018Oh I could never fly with my wife or my husband.\u2019\u201d For Joel and Shelley, working together is seamless \u2013 a joy that comes easily to them both. \u201cWe\u2019re best friends,\u201d says Shelley. \u201cThere\u2019s just that unspoken bond,\u201d says Joel. Inspired by \u2018Top Gun\u2019 Shelley grew up in Iowa and moved to Colorado \u2013 Joel\u2019s home state \u2013 as a teenager. The two spent their high school years unaware of one another, but they graduated the same year, and both opted to study at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado in the late 1980s. Joel says he was very influenced by the 1985 Tom Cruise movie \u201cTop Gun\u201d \u2013 \u201cwhich made flying jets look like a lot of fun.\u201d For Shelley, who was an athlete, the appeal of the Air Force Academy was less about flying \u2013 which she only really discovered once she was enrolled \u2013 and more an opportunity to play college basketball. \u201cI didn\u2019t attend the Academy to pursue flying, initially. Once I was there I realized it was a great opportunity for a fun and challenging career,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the introduction to flying there made me want to pursue it further.\u201d Joel and Shelley spent four years studying at the Air Force Academy without actually crossing paths, although Joel was vaguely aware of Shelley. \u201cThere\u2019s not that many women at the Air Force Academy, so I kind of knew who she was,\u201d he says. The two finally met a few years later, after they\u2019d both completed pilot training in different states. They got the same first assignment \u2013 flying Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft in Texas. When Shelley arrived in Texas, Joel had been there for a few months. \u201cSo I was there, kind of established, and she came into the office where I was working,\u201d he recalls. \u201cShe came in and turned in the paperwork, and we said, \u2018Hi,\u2019 just exchanged some pleasantries.\u201d Joel was struck by Shelley right away. \u201cShe\u2019s tall. She looks great. She left the room and this other coworker was just looking at me smiling. And I said, \u2018What?\u2019 And he could tell.\u201d Looking back, Joel thinks it was the \u201ceye contact\u201d he had with Shelley that gave his feelings away. Or maybe just \u201cthe look on my face.\u201d \u201cThere was something there,\u201d says Joel, smiling. \u201cBut I just kind of laughed it off. I was like, \u2018Nah, we\u2019re just going to be friends.\u2019\u201d Joel was also a bit intimidated by Shelley \u2013 he was \u201cattracted to her right away,\u201d but didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d ever be interested in him. \u201cShe\u2019s taller than me. And I had never dated anyone taller than me,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s an athlete, she\u2019s a natural leader, and just an impressive person.\u201d But Joel\u2019s warm nature appealed to Shelley. She felt comfortable around him right away. They became close friends. \u201cJoel has a really great sense of humor,\u201d says Shelley. \u201cI love that about him. And he just really has a sensitive heart to people, all people around him, he looks out for people.\u201d \u201cThat really attracted me to him. And also, he used to have a nice dark head of hair. I really liked that too. But he has a very distinguished look now, and he\u2019s just as handsome as ever.\u201d About a year after they first met, Joel and Shelley were deployed abroad, together. That\u2019s when they \u201ckind of started dating,\u201d as Joel puts it. While there wasn\u2019t much opportunity to go on actual dates on active service, they bonded. \u201cConversations, talking about everything, basically,\u201d says Shelley. \u201cWe really got to know each other\u2019s heart that way. And I think it just made it clear that this is what we were supposed to do.\u201d Back home in the US, the two \u201cstarted officially dating.\u201d \u201cWe just kind of knew that this was going to be it,\u201d says Joel. \u201cAnd within a few months, we got married.\u201d Joel and Shelley became instructor Air Force pilots in Mississippi. Then, in the early 2000s, Shelley gave birth to the couple\u2019s kids, two twins, a boy and a girl. Shelley left flying around this time, but she stayed in the military, working for the US Air National Guard. \u201cI wanted to be at home,\u201d says Shelley. The path to pregnancy wasn\u2019t easy for the couple and Joel calls their kids a \u201chuge blessing.\u201d \u201cWe went through in vitro a couple of times,\u201d he says. \u201cIt took a few years for us to actually get pregnant.\u201d The family relocated back to Colorado and Joel transitioned from military flying to commercial flying, becoming a pilot with Southwest Airlines in 2006. Returning to the air Cut to 2021. The pandemic years were tough going for Joel and Shelley, emotionally speaking. While the couple stayed healthy, their kids were in their late teens and struggled with the upheaval. Plus, Covid was impacting the aviation industry, so Joel was flying less. Around this time, Shelley left her job at the National Guard. She and Joel were wholly focused on their family and their kids\u2019 wellbeing. But in time, the pandemic waned and Joel started flying more regularly. Joel and Shelley\u2019s kids graduated high school and started the next phase of their lives. It was a transitional period for the Atkinson family, and in turn, Shelley started considering her future. She found herself dreaming about flying. She hadn\u2019t been behind the controls of a plane in over two decades, but she felt a call to return. She started wondering if, like Joel, she could become a commercial pilot. When Shelley voiced the idea to Joel, he was immediately enthusiastic. \u201cI said, \u2018Come fly with me,\u2019\u201d says Joel, joking \u201ccue the music.\u201d Then, by coincidence, later that day, Joel saw a social media post from his airline, Southwest, about a pilot who\u2019d taken a two decade break to raise a family, then returned to flying. \u201cShe literally had the same story as me,\u201d says Shelley. It felt like a sign. While Joel didn\u2019t know this other pilot directly, he was able to reach out to her via his work network and pass on contact details to Shelley, who subsequently texted the other pilot, asking for guidance and advice. Then, with encouragement from her new friend \u2013 plus Joel\u2019s wholehearted support \u2013 Shelley committed to returning to the skies full time. While Shelley had years of Air Force experience, she hadn\u2019t flown airplanes for 20 years. She had had to hit the books, take additional tests and ensure her qualifications were up to speed. But before long Shelley was hired by SkyWest Airlines, flying regional jets. Then she joined Joel at Southwest in 2023. \u201cIt was crazy. It happened way faster than I thought it would. It\u2019s been amazing,\u201d says Shelley. \u201cIt was meant to be,\u201d says Joel. Flying together Joel and Shelley credit their success as a co-pilot team to their nearly three decades of marriage, as well as years of co-parenting. \u201cRaising two teenagers during Covid, I tell people that was a lot harder than what we\u2019re doing now,\u201d says Joel. Plus, the two met as colleagues \u2013 so they know how to balance commitment to a job with enjoying each other\u2019s company. Still, as a married couple in the military, Joel and Shelley never flew in the same aircraft. \u201cThe military kind of frowns upon it,\u201d says Joel. \u201cIt\u2019s a little morbid, but they don\u2019t want you to both go down in a plane crash.\u201d No such guidelines exist in commercial aviation, and so once Shelley joined Southwest, she and Joel were able to work side by side. Joel\u2019s seniority allows him to regularly bid for flights with Shelley. And the two find Joel\u2019s years of commercial aviation experience pairs well with Shelley\u2019s fresh take. \u201cShe looks to me and relies on me for the experience that I have. But I also know that she is a very sharp person, she just went through a lot of training. So her knowledge is fresh. And she also has that wisdom and judgment,\u201d says Joel. Since the excitement of their first flight, Joel and Shelley tend not to \u201cmake a big deal\u201d about being a husband and wife pilot duo \u2013 unless it\u2019s preempted by their colleagues. \u201cWe wait for them to ask,\u201d says Shelley. As the couple share the same last name, often crew members put two and two together. As Joel\u2019s the more senior of the two, he often runs the pre-flight briefing. Sometimes he\u2019ll end it with a quick, throwaway: \u201cYes, we\u2019re married.\u201d The crew usually \u201cstart laughing,\u201d says Joel. When Joel and Shelley are taking off and landing, they\u2019re focused on the job at hand. \u201cIt\u2019s very technical,\u201d says Joel. \u201cWe\u2019re running checklists.\u201d But when the airplane reaches cruising altitude, \u201cthere\u2019s some downtime\u201d and Joel and Shelley will make the most of it, talking through their thoughts on life, their kids, their future plans and everything else that\u2019s on their mind. \u201cIt\u2019s so great, because all the years that I was flying, and she was at home, anything I wanted to talk to her about when I\u2019m up in the air, it had to wait,\u201d says Joel. \u201cYou\u2019re saving up conversations until you\u2019re home. It\u2019s like now we\u2019re making up for lost time.\u201d Then, when they land, Joel and Shelley make the most of the layovers. Southwest largely flies domestically, so the couple enjoy traveling the length and breadth of the US together. \u201cIt is a great job, because you go see different places and spend time in different cities,\u201d says Joel, but before Shelley joined Southwest, Joel says layovers sometimes felt like \u201cwasted time, because it was just me, and I couldn\u2019t share it with her.\u201d \u201cBut now we\u2019re together when we\u2019re on the road \u2013 it\u2019s so fun. Because every night on the road, it\u2019s a date night together,\u201d he says. Now, instead of counting the days until he\u2019s home, Joel says his \u201chome is right here\u201d because \u201cshe\u2019s with me.\u201d Family connection While Joel and Shelley have flown together countless times since Shelley joined Southwest, they\u2019ve yet to fly with their kids in tow. That\u2019s on the to-do list \u2013 plus, their son is also training to be a pilot, so there\u2019s a chance Shelley and Joel might pilot an aircraft with him in the future. For Shelley, an additional perk of the last couple of years is her adult kids getting to \u201cview her as a pilot for the first time.\u201d Shelley and Joel\u2019s children grew up knowing their parents met flying jets \u2013 but\u00a0while they saw their father regularly piloting airplanes for Southwest, they never saw Shelley flying. Shelley is really happy her children get to see her doing a job she loves. Shelley\u2019s also proud to be a female pilot in an industry that\u2019s still very male-dominated. She hopes to inspire other people, especially mothers who may have taken a break from the workplace to raise a family, by demonstrating that returning to a passion is possible. \u201cI hope it encourages other women that there is this opportunity out there \u2013 you can come back and you can still do it,\u201d she says. Shelley says she\u2019s really loved rediscovering her love of flying. \u201cThe view from 36,000 feet is pretty awesome,\u201d she says. \u201cFlying over parts of the country - I just love looking down and going, \u2018Oh, what town is that?\u2019\u201d Shelley and Joel particularly enjoy flying in and out of San Diego, California, but they also love it when Southwest takes them to New York. Before Christmas, they enjoyed a stopover in New York City and went searching for the settings of their favorite movies, from \u201cElf\u201d to \u201cSerendipity.\u201d \u201cI love traveling, seeing new places,\u201d says Joel, who adds that he\u2019s gone from avoiding working weekends to voluntarily signing up for Saturday and Sunday flight shifts. He and Shelley now spend Saturday nights watching jazz in Portland, going on hikes in Sacramento or drinking cocktails in Palm Springs. Joel\u2019s always loved flying \u2013 especially what he calls \u201cthe art and science\u201d of aviation. He also loves \u201cserving people, getting them to where they need to be,\u201d but he admits flying during the pandemic was hard going. For Joel, having Shelley now by his side at work has \u201cbeen just a complete turnaround.\u201d Now even the ride to work is fun as the couple car share, coffees in hand. Joel and Shelley, who post about their adventures on their Instagram account @luvpilots, are currently planning to pick up a flight together on Valentine\u2019s Day. Joel bought the two of them heart-printed ties especially \u2013 they\u2019re \u201csilly, but fun,\u201d says Joel. The couple enjoy chronicling their travels on social media \u2013 celebrating their marriage, their respective careers and their adventures. \u201cWe feel blessed. We\u2019re thankful for the opportunity,\u201d says Joel. \u201cWe\u2019re thankful to Southwest Airlines for letting us do this together.\u201d \u201cIf you love doing something, why not do it with the person you love?\u201d says Shelley.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/married-southwest-pilots/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_travel_high-speed-sleeper-train-hong-kong-beijing-shanghai-intl-hnk", "text": "Interested in capping off your trip to Hong Kong with a long weekend in Beijing or Shanghai? A new high-speed sleeper train service is making that possibility easier than ever. Two new overnight routes connecting the city with Beijing and Shanghai entered into service on June 15. Both trains depart Hong Kong West Kowloon Station in the evening and arrive in Beijing at 6.53 a.m. and Shanghai at 6.45 a.m., making the journeys around 12.5 hours and 11 hours respectively. Return trips depart from Beijing and Shanghai at around 8 p.m. and arrive in Hong Kong at 8.47 a.m. and 7.29 a.m. These routes run four days a week, departing all three stations every evening from Friday to Monday. \u201cIt will be more comfortable and faster, reducing the travel time by about half, and will cover a wider range of destinations, including popular tourist attraction cities,\u201d John Lee, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, said in a press statement, referring to the previous overnight train routes that connected Hong Kong with China\u2019s two biggest cities. Those intercity railway services, Beijing-Kowloon and Shanghai-Kowloon, launched in 1997. The train ride to China\u2019s capital took around 24 hours while the journey to Shanghai was about 19 hours. The services were suspended during the pandemic in 2020 and have been replaced by the new high-speed options that launched on June 15. But while the new trips do indeed slash the overnight travel time by almost half, the high-speed sleeper services take slightly longer than the daytime bullet trains already in service connecting Hong Kong and the two cities in mainland China. Currently, the train company operates one daily high-speed connection to Beijing, which takes around 8.5 hours, and one to Shanghai, which is around 7.5 hours. Why bother with the longer journey then? The new sleeper trains might not be the fastest way to get between Hong Kong and Beijing or Shanghai, but they are a great option for business travelers who need to arrive well-rested before standard office hours, as well as leisure tourists who don\u2019t want to waste a full day on the train or wish to save money on accommodations. Inside the sleeper trains Each of the electric multiple unit (EMU) trains used to service the routes has 16 carriages, including 13 sleeper cars, two second-class seating cars and one dining car. There are three types of seats to choose from: Second class (without a bed), sleeper and deluxe sleeper. A standard sleeper class cabin consists of two bunk beds, sleeping four passengers, in a cabin. The deluxe version, only available on the Hong Kong-Shanghai route for now, features a bunk bed, wardrobe and sofa. Prices range from HKD937 to HKD1,506 ($120-$193) for the Hong Kong-Beijing route and HKD682 to HKD2,128 ($88-273) for the Hong Kong-Shanghai route. Passengers who want to book a seat can reserve their tickets on China Railway\u2019s official ticketing site 12306.cn. Note that for trains departing from Hong Kong, you have to search \u201chkwestkowloon.\u201d International travelers can also book through ticketing platforms such as Trip.com or buy their tickets at the West Kowloon Station directly. A joint immigration checkpoint inside West Kowloon Station allows passengers to avoid additional checks when crossing the border in and out of Hong Kong. However, travelers still need to have a valid China visa or travel document to ride the train. (Although part of China, Hong Kong is governed under a separate legal framework.) Hong Kong\u2019s controversial high-speed railway Opened in 2018, the 26-kilometer Hong Kong high-speed railway is a part of the larger Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link (XRL). Costing more than $10.7 billion to build, the Hong Kong section connects the city with China\u2019s 25,000-kilometer national high-speed rail network. But the project, which marked the first time mainland Chinese laws were given jurisdiction inside Hong Kong territory, stirred much controversy, even well before its opening. The massive price tag, the limited traveling speed (the Hong Kong section has a maximum speed of 200 kilometers/hour \u2013 much lower than the usual 300 kilometers/hour due to its short distance) and the political implications all cast a shadow over the new railway. Controversy aside, the introduction of the Express Rail Link provided an alternative way to travel to major Chinese cities through Hong Kong \u2013 and avoid China\u2019s notorious flight delays. The Hong Kong station now offers direct trips to 78 destinations around China and some 70,600 passengers use the network daily according to official figures.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/travel/high-speed-sleeper-train-hong-kong-beijing-shanghai-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_atlantis-royal-dubai-best-luxury-resort-hnk-spc-intl", "text": "Free-flowing champagne, 24-karat gold facials, and a VVIP cabana with a suspended plunge pool: these are just some of the ultra-luxury experiences at one of the Middle East\u2019s most opulent resorts. Atlantis, The Royal, opened in Dubai last year, next to the brand\u2019s flagship resort on The Palm. Its three-day opening party \u2014 featuring performances from Beyonc\u00e9 and Swedish House Mafia \u2014 put the hotel on the map as one of the region\u2019s most iconic resorts, and nine months later it became the only hotel in the Middle East to snag a spot on the inaugural\u00a0World\u2019s 50 Best Hotels list. \u201cThe guest rooms and suites are truly setting the bar for the industry, but beyond that, there\u2019s also the collection of restaurants: it\u2019s a great location for entertainment and dining,\u201d says Tom Roelens, general manager at The Royal and managing director at Atlantis Resorts. 90 swimming pools Atlantis, The Royal, isn\u2019t a resort to do things by halves \u2014 evidenced in its 90 bathing spots, ranging from a 300-foot-long (91-meter) sky pool to private cabana plunge baths. CNN visited the hotel in March, before devastating floods hit the city in April. The resort\u2019s must-see venue is Cloud 22, the infinity pool on the 22nd floor. Its \u201cfloating\u201d sun loungers shaded by Dolce&Gabbana parasols offer sweeping views of the iconic man-made Palm islands, with cocktails and light bites (caviar bruschetta, anyone?) available at the swim-up lotus bar. There\u2019s a second lap pool overlooking the Arabian Gulf, and the deck is lined with private cabanas. But when private isn\u2019t enough, there\u2019s the VVIP duplex pool cabana; used by Kendall Jenner for the launch party of her tequila brand, the luxe pool pad has two lounge areas for entertaining and its very own glass-bottomed dipping pool, suspended from the second floor. In the resort\u2019s sky pool villas and signature suites, guests also have access to pools on their private terrace, up to 43 floors high, says Roelens. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken the concept of a resort, which typically would be horizontal, but we\u2019ve made that vertical,\u201d adds Roelens. \u201cThat really creates a very unique experience, where you have these exceptional views across The Palm and skyline of Dubai, but at the same time, you have great privacy.\u201d Pools aren\u2019t the only water feature in this hotel. The interior designers dip into the region\u2019s history, taking inspiration from the Bedouin, the nomadic people who originally inhabited the Arabian desert and navigated via water wells. The theme is neatly summarized in \u201cDroplets\u201d: a 37-foot-tall (11.3-meter) stainless-steel structure in the lobby that represents the first drop of rain in the desert. The theme of water is repeated throughout the resort, from glass elevators encased in 3,500 gallons of cascading water, to three floor-to-ceiling aquariums filled with 7,200 marine animals. Gilded glamour The hotel\u2019s 795 rooms boast designer amenities from diamond jeweler Graff, bathrobes by Italian luxury textile brand Frette, and specially designed gold toothbrushes, combs and brushes. Guests with access to the \u201cRoyal Club\u201d can take advantage of all-day champagne service, daily afternoon tea and canapes, although there\u2019s no shortage of places to eat here. The resort has 17 dining options, including \u201cthe largest collection of celebrity chef restaurants anywhere on the planet,\u201d says Roelens. And venues like Nobu Beach Club \u2014 the luxury hospitality brand\u2019s first, and currently only, beach club venue \u2014 are helping establish the resort\u2019s reputation as \u201csomewhere they want to see and be seen,\u201d adds Roelens. For a bit of rest and relaxation, its 32,300 square-foot (3,000-square-meter) spa offers not only a gold facial (this is Dubai, after all) but also a \u201cgolden hour massage\u201d \u2014 gold-dipped hot volcanic stones with gold-infused aromatherapy oil \u2014 along with therapies grounded in Arabic wellness traditions: desert sand and date sugar exfoliations, and Gulf salt and date seed scrubs. A penthouse fit for a Queen (B) For the ultra-rich, the star of the show is the Royal Mansion, an 11,840-square-foot (1,100-square-meter) four-bedroom, split-level suite \u2014 where Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z stayed when the superstar performed for the opening. Accessed via a private elevator and entrance landscaped with 100-year-old olive trees the resort \u201cadopted,\u201d the duplex offers \u201c360-degree views\u201d across the Palm and the Gulf, says Roelens. With its own infinity pool, amenities by French fashion house Herm\u00e8s, a triple-height library, a home-cinema room, and three dining spaces, guests are given a \u201cunique experience\u201d here, he says. \u201cWe have added some great touches \u2014backgammon games by (crystalware designers) Baccarat, and a Louis Vuitton ping pong table, so there are some really fun elements to that suite as well,\u201d he adds. The stunning interiors are complemented by five-star service: guests are met at the airport where their luggage is picked up by staff, and designer brands \u2014 from Graff to Valentino \u2014 are brought into the suite for a personal shopping experience. Chefs from any of the resort\u2019s restaurants, including its celebrity venues, can cook for guests in the suite\u2019s private kitchen, and 24-hour butlers and bartenders are on-call for any occasion. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s about the service: it\u2019s about our endeavor to create what our guests are looking for, whether or not they know they are looking for that,\u201d says Roelens. A taste of luxury With room rates starting from around $1,300 a night during high season \u2014 and from $100,000 for its most exclusive penthouse, one of the city\u2019s most expensive suites \u2014 the high-life comes with a hefty price tag. But there are more \u201caccessible\u201d ways to enjoy the resort, says Roelens: the Sky Blaze fountain, for example, located in the resort\u2019s expansive grounds, puts on a \u201cdramatic\u201d show every hour from 12pm daily. The fountain is overlooked by Elements Lounge, a terrace bar serving up sunset cocktails, and Estiatorio Milos by Costas Spiliadis, a Greek restaurant with extensive outdoor seating. The business lunch menu at the latter costs just 200 dirhams ($55) \u2014 not a bad price for fountain-side dining at the Middle East\u2019s \u201cbest\u201d resort.\u00a0\u00a0", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/atlantis-royal-dubai-best-luxury-resort-hnk-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_james-beard-award-winners-2024", "text": "The Oscars of the food world \u2014 the James Beard Awards \u2014 were handed out Monday night to many chefs and restaurants reflecting cultures and regions that have long been overlooked when honoring culinary achievement in the United States. At Dakar NOLA, winner of Best New Restaurant, Chef Serigne Mbaye blends his West African roots with the ingredients of New Orleans on a modern Senegalese tasting menu. \u201cI always knew that West Africa had something to say,\u201d Mbaye said at the awards ceremony at the Lyric Opera in Chicago, even as he cooked classic Creole and French cuisine at other restaurants. \u201cThat kept me going.\u201d The Outstanding Restaurant winner, Langbaan in Portland, Oregon, transforms classic Thai food with Pacific Northwest ingredients on a five-course tasting menu. Outstanding Chef winner Michael Rafidi dedicated his award to Palestinian people all over the world in his acceptance speech. Rafidi\u2019s creative twists on traditional Arabic cuisine at Albi, his Michelin-starred Washington, DC restaurant, are inspired by his family\u2019s roots in Ramallah. The 2024 winners bring heritage from all over the globe \u2014\u00a0the Philippines, Mexico, Japan, Peru, Vietnam, Senegal \u2014 to tables across the United States. This year\u2019s awards also bring recognition to restaurants in many smaller towns and states that have not historically been recognized with James Beard Awards. \u201cTwo words that have never been mentioned here before: West Virginia,\u201d said Paul Smith, chef at 1010 Bridge in Charleston, West Virginia, and winner of Best Chef: Southeast.\u00a0Lula Drake Wine Parlour in Columbia, South Carolina, earned the award for Outstanding Wine and Other Beverages Program. Chefs in Mission, Texas; Mystic, Connecticut; and Easton, Maryland all received honors. For some winners, the awards seem to represent the culmination of a fortuitous change of course. Masako Morishita grew up in Japan and eventually moved to Washington, DC\u00a0to be a cheerleader for the Washington Commanders. Atsuko Fujimoto arrived in Portland, Maine, 23 years ago from Tokyo with no professional kitchen experience. They forged new careers in the culinary world. \u201cWow, this is my wildest American dream came true,\u201d said Morishita, who received the Emerging Chef Award for her Japanese comfort food at Perry\u2019s, a decades-old restaurant in DC\u2019s Adams Morgan neighborhood that has been revived under Morishita. Fujimoto, of Norimoto Bakery in Portland, Maine, received the Outstanding Baker award. Challenging times Many of the challenges facing the restaurant industry \u2014\u00a0and the wider culture \u2014\u00a0were addressed over the course of the evening: climate change, sustainability, inclusivity and mental health. A handful of honorees received achievement awards on Monday night. That group included legendary food writer, editor, novelist and television personality Ruth Reichl, who worked as a food critic at The New York Times and editor-in-chief of Gourmet Magazine and was honored for Lifetime Achievement. Reichl thanked the James Beard Foundation and the assembled food world luminaries for the transformation of American food culture that she\u2019s seen in her lifetime. \u201cYou changed the way we eat, created a delicious revolution and a world where people finally, finally understand that eating is an ethical act and that our food choices really matter. It gives me hope for the future,\u201d she said. Prior to the ceremony, which was livestreamed via website Eater, Reichl was asked on the event\u2019s red carpet about the origin of the term \u201cOscars of the food world.\u201d To her surprise, she was told that she coined it in her report from the very first awards more than three decades ago. The nonprofit James Beard Foundation was established in 1986, shortly after \u201cpioneer foodie\u201d James Beard\u2019s death, \u201cto celebrate, support and elevate the people behind America\u2019s food culture.\u201d The first awards ceremony was held in 1991. Beard was the host of \u201cI Love to Eat,\u201d the first food program on network television in 1946 and was called the \u201cDean of American Cookery\u201d by The New York Times in 1954. The foundation, which has faced controversy in recent years, in 2022 introduced new policies and procedures and a new code of ethics sparked by criticism about a lack of diversity and allegations of chefs\u2019 bad behavior. Last year, the process of vetting chef behavior led to its own controversy. Some of the night\u2019s winners expressed hopes that changes within the industry will continue to improve culinary culture. \u201cMy only hope as I stand here today is that we can continue as an industry to do the right thing. We can continue to seek diversity and inclusion and female-led teams as things that are extremely effective,\u201d said Gregory Gourdet, who won his third James Beard Award in three years on Monday, taking home the award for Best Chef: Pacific Northwest. Gourdet spoke of his move to Portland, Oregon, in 2008 from New York, leaving rehab early, \u201cbroken and miserable,\u201d and finding his purpose as a chef creating a hub for Haitian culture at his restaurant Kann. \u201cI hope that if we can slowly continue to do the right thing that the next generation has it a little bit better than we do, and the generation after that has it even better than they did. And we can just get rid of this generational trauma that\u2019s been affecting us and holding us hostage in our industry.\u201d Restaurant and Chef Awards (2024 finalists and winners Outstanding Restaurateur Hamissi Mamba and Nadia Nijimbere, Baobab Fare, Detroit, MI Quynh-Vy and Yenvy Pham, Ph\u1edf B\u1eafc S\u00fap Shop, Ph\u1edfcific Standard Time, and The Boat, Seattle, WA Chris Viaud, Greenleaf, Ansanm, and Pavilion, Milford and Wolfeboro, NH Hollis Wells Silverman, Eastern Point Collective (The Duck & The Peach, M\u00e9li, The Wells, and others), Washington, D.C.

{"id": "travel_matera-italy-parkour-visitors-damage", "text": "Jumping from building to building in an ancient city might seem like a dream for those who practice parkour \u2014 a sport that involves making it past obstacles \u2014 but it can cause damage to historic buildings. A London-based parkour group, Team Phat, visited the ancient Italian city of\u00a0Matera, running, climbing and leaping through its streets and over its\u00a0precious structures. One of the freerunners caused a segment of a historic building to fall off, sending both himself and the building part crashing to the ground. Matera, a city of stone which dates back to the Paleolithic era, is located in the Basilicata region in Southern Italy. In 1993, it was granted UNESCO World Heritage status and was the European Capital of Culture in 2019. A\u00a0video\u00a0of parkour stunts in the ancient city was posted by Team Phat on YouTube two months ago, along with a caption explaining that they were \u201cin the beautiful city of\u00a0Matera\u201d where one of their members, Devon McIntosh, \u201chad a scary fall that could have been really bad.\u201d The video shows the freerunner jumping off a building and attempting to use a stone ledge to help him get to another building across the street. But the ledge could not withstand his force and dramatically broke off. An off-camera member of the team suggests that they \u201chide the evidence\u201d and McIntosh shows his injury to his leg. The video has attracted many critical comments on social media. \u201cThis city is a UNESCO heritage site for a reason,\u201d wrote an Instagram user named Bruno Burke. \u201cWe should enjoy our [parkour] discipline as much as possible, but we should also watch where we step, not only for safety but also for respect of culture and history.\u201d Misbehaving visitors Many of\u00a0Matera\u2019s districts and habitable caves were renovated in the second half of the 20th century, as the city regained its charm and became a popular Instagrammable hotspot. Unsurprisingly, international cinema also pays the occasional visit. The 2021 James Bond movie, \u201cNo time to\u00a0Die\u201d features an exciting car chase through\u00a0Matera\u2019s streets. The well curated remains of the ancient cave churches, fortified farmhouses and districts make\u00a0Matera\u00a0a city of universal value, according to UNESCO. CNN has reached out to Matera\u2019s police force for comment on the parkour incident. Team Phat\u2019s behavior has raised further questions about the conduct of travelers at sites of architectural beauty. At the start of the video, one of the Team Phat members said: \u201cAs some of you know, we\u2019ve been banned from Venice and we can never go back.\u201d In March 2023, a Team Phat member\u00a0jumped into a canal in Venice, following which Mayor Luigi Brugnaro commented on X:\u00a0\u201cThis \u2018subject\u2019 should be given a certificate of STUPIDITY\u2026. We are trying to identify him to denounce him and his companion that made the stupid video for social media.\u201d On April 25, entry fee tickets were introduced in Venice. Brugnaro\u00a0said: \u201cVenice is the first city in the world to start on this journey which could become an example for other fragile cities that must be preserved.\u201d In March, a historic district in Kyoto, Japan, announced that it is banning tourists from entering, following\u00a0local frustrations\u00a0about visitors\u2019 poor behavior and failure to follow Japanese customs and etiquette.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/matera-italy-parkour-visitors-damage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_christ-redeemer-rio-de-janeiro-brazil-history", "text": "Think of Rio de Janeiro and the first image that comes to mind \u2013 no matter your own belief system \u2013 is probably a religious one. Perched on the Corcovado \u2013 a 2,300-foot-high granite outcrop looming above the city \u2013 the Cristo Redentor (Christ the Redeemer) statue sweeps its arms out in a warm embrace, welcoming visitors to the city of samba. \u201cThe first thing we see when we arrive at the city\u2019s two airports is this brother of ours welcoming us with open arms,\u201d says Rio designer Gilson Martins, whose handbags have been seen on the arms of everyone from Madonna to Michelle Obama. Does he look for the statue when he arrives home after a trip abroad? No, he says \u2013 because there\u2019s no need. \u201cIt is he who finds me when I arrive in Rio.\u201d For over a century, the statue has been a symbol of Rio de Janeiro. In February 1922, architect Heitor da Silva Costa won the competition to design what sounded like a foolhardy project: an enormous statue of Jesus teetering on a high mountain peak as slim as a toothpick. It was inaugurated nine years later. Yet nearly 100 years on, the statue \u2013 98 feet high with an arm span of 92 feet \u2013 is still standing, and is today a symbol of the city, known all over the world. Is it a miracle from on high? Or a testament to the engineering prowess of the Brazilians who built it? For Paulo Vidal, architect and Rio superintendent of the Instituto do Patrim\u00f4nio Hist\u00f3rico e Art\u00edstico Nacional (Institute of Historical and Artistic Heritage, or IPHAN), which approves any restoration projects, it\u2019s the latter. \u201cCivil engineering in Brazil has always been at the forefront of the world, especially in reinforced concrete construction,\u201d he says. And therein lies its secret. Although the Christ the Redeemer looks like a stone sculpture, it\u2019s actually what Vidal calls a \u201cconcrete building covered in soapstone tablets.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean the construction of it wasn\u2019t heroic, however. Turning back a \u2018sea of godlessness\u2019 The statue\u2019s genesis came from what was essentially an act of religious propaganda: a bid to turn back a post-World War I \u201csea of godlessness\u201d by installing a figure of Jesus Christ to watch over Rio, visible from anywhere in the city \u2013 an omnipresent god made stony flesh. A competition to design the statue was held and Da Silva Costa \u2013 who imagined it almost as a sun salutation, having Jesus illuminated by the dawn and ringed by a rosy \u201chalo\u201d at sunset \u2013 won the commission. It wasn\u2019t always going to be the simple figure that we see today. Initially he designed the sculpture as Christ on the road to Calvary, carrying his cross and a globe in his other hand. Luckily, with the help of artist Carlos Oswald, he switched to the more streamlined, modernist design, in which Christ\u2019s outstretched arms not only form the shape of the cross themselves, but seem to embrace the city below it. French-Polish sculptor Paul Landowski collaborated on the final design, streamlining the shape even further, bringing it in line with Art Deco style that was all the rage at the time. Building such a colossal structure was always going to be difficult; building it on top of a high, perilous peak even more so. Not just because of the difficulty of construction; but also of maintenance. \u201cThe big challenge was to design a project that would withstand the weather,\u201d says Vidal, who says that the peak of Corcovado is \u201cexposed to very aggressive atmospheric conditions.\u201d What\u2019s more, this was to be a sculpture for the ages, \u201ccarefully designed to withstand the elements and to stand the test of time as a symbol of human ingenuity and devotion,\u201d says Vidal. Rio architects were already adept in concrete \u2013 the A Noite building, a city newspaper headquarters, was the highest building in Latin America when it was inaugurated in 1929. Da Silva Costa and his team used that experience, cladding the Christ\u2019s concrete core in steatite, or soapstone, which is known as an insulator, and was traditionally used as cooking pots in the state of Minas Gerais, Vidal explains. It\u2019s tough, too \u2013 a century on, the cladding is still \u201cwell preserved,\u201d he says. The team decided on a mosaic effect \u2013 invisible from far away, but adding detail for those who made the pilgrimage to see it up close. Soapstone was sourced from a quarry in Minas Gerais, chosen for its calm, gray-green hue. It was carved into small pieces \u2013 just over 1.5 inches in length and 0.2 inches thick, according to M\u00e1rcia Braga, the architect and restoration expert who led a major conservation project of the monument in 2010 \u2013 and attached to the cement \u201cbody.\u201d There are around 6 million tiles on the Christ Redeemer in total. Work began in 1926, funded mainly by the church in Rio, and on October 12, 1931, the statue was inaugurated. Today, it\u2019s part of the \u201cCarioca Landscapes between the Mountain and the Sea\u201d UNESCO World Heritage site, established in 2012. Four years earlier, the statue had been listed by IPHAN for its historical importance. It had been declared a municipal heritage site in 1990. It\u2019s also the largest Art Deco statue in the world. Constant conservation Of course, the same ingenuity that Vidal refers to regarding its engineering has also been on full display during the past century as extreme weather batters Corcovado. The fact that a visit to the Christ the Redeemer \u2013 either taking a tiny train to the peak, or hiking up \u2013 is a must-do activity in Rio, with around 2 million visitors per year, means it\u2019s even more important to keep the statue safe. It\u2019s no easy task. \u201cConservation is a major challenge because it\u2019s exposed to very aggressive atmospheric conditions \u2013 whether that\u2019s the sun\u2019s rays, which cause the mantle and structure to expand and shrink every day, or the southwest winds that hit the statue laden with salt and sand, causing constant abrasion to the coating,\u201d explains Vidal. Then there\u2019s lightning. Rio de Janeiro is a city of storms, and this high peak attracts strikes like bees to a honeypot. Lightning rods were originally built into the statue\u2019s head to help with strikes. Vidal says that these have been expanded over the years, as storms increase in intensity. In 2021, the \u2018crown\u2019 of rods was quadrupled in size, and the earthing system was expanded. The statue has undergone a major conservation effort every decade since 1980, but Vidal says the site is \u201cconstantly\u201d monitored for any emergency maintenance that might be needed. \u201cWe know the materials, the degradation processes, the aggressive agents and the behavior of the structure,\u201d he says. The Christ has five large, covered holes for conservators to enter inside \u2013 one on top of its head, and four more on the shoulders and elbows. There are 14 smaller holes which, when open, help with air circulation, says Braga. \u201cInside the statue, you feel as if you were totally protected from the weather and environment,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is silence \u2013 it is a very strong structure, and as you are climbing to the head, the spaces to cross through get very narrow. When you finally get out on the top of the head, it is a wonderful sensation of freedom.\u201d Replacing 300,000 tiles Braga \u2013 who calls the restoration project an \u201cenormous responsibility\u201d \u2013 was 50 when she worked on the statue. \u201cI felt as if it was a great event in my professional career,\u201d she says. In a 2011 paper about the project, shared with CNN, she wrote that her team found spores from the Atlantic rainforest on the statue \u2013 making the monument even more redolent of Rio and Brazil as a whole. The bacteria were cleaned off with steam and water jets at 158 degrees Fahrenheit. The statue was also regrouted. No detail is ignored during the conservation projects, the most recent of which took place from 2020-2022. The soapstone from the original quarry has run out over the past century \u2013 \u201cthis color is increasingly difficult to find in the natural world,\u201d wrote Braga of her conservation project \u2013 so when pieces of mosaic need replacing, conservators carefully look at stone from other quarries in Minas Gerais, to try and match the original color as best as possible. During her renovation, Braga rejected 80% of the replacement tesserae, picking only those that best matched the original color. She also replaced stones that had been added in previous restorations but weren\u2019t a good color match, replacing 5% of those 6 million tesserae in total. Such herculanean efforts are worth it, says Vidal. \u201cChrist the Redeemer is an iconic image that publicizes the city and the country to the world,\u201d he says. \u201cIt attracts tourism and consequently foreign currency to the city.\u201d Gilson Martins agrees. Christ Redeemer bags are his top sellers, tied with those sporting the Sugarloaf Mountain. \u2018Like a childhood friend\u2019 For cariocas \u2013 the inhabitants of Rio de Janeiro \u2013 the Christ has become like a family member. Tom Jobin, the bossa nova grandee who composed The Girl from Ipanema, wrote of its \u201copen arms over Guanabara\u201d in his song, Samba do Avi\u00e3o. Another song was called, simply, Corcovado. \u201cDa janela, ve-se o Corcovado, O Redentor, que lindo,\u201d he wrote \u2013 \u201cFrom the window you can see Corcovado, the Redeemer, how beautiful.\u201d Martins himself has produced two art exhibitions centered around the sculpture, and has recently made an EP, singing about the statue in three of the five songs. In fact, he says, it was his childhood memories of observing the statue that inspired his songwriting. \u201cTo me, he is my brother, my friend of many years, always present in my life,\u201d he says of the Christ. \u201cThe feeling is like having a childhood friend with whom I have a lot of intimacy, and he is always there for us to talk to.\u201d Martin\u2019s deep devotion to the concrete statue is a sentiment shared by cariocas across the city. \u201cFor me, as a carioca, architect and urban planner, Christ the Redeemer is a landmark of territorial identification. If I see Christ the Redeemer I know where I am, and that I am at \u2018home,\u2019\u201d says Vidal. \u201cIn order to be sung about in music, the statue needs to be loved by the population \u2013 and it is. It welcomes and embraces residents and visitors.\u201d For Francesco Perrotta-Bosch, architecture critic and the biographer of modernist architect Lina Bo Bardi, Corcovado is \u201cthe most democratic landmark in the city.\u201d Rio de Janeiro is famously a place where great wealth and poverty live side by side, but in a sense, the sculpture unites them. \u201cYou can see it from rich neighborhoods and poor neighborhoods,\u201d he says. \u201cCariocas can observe it from the south or north zone and will have a reference to find themselves in the city. Largely due to Corcovado, Rio becomes a city with many visual elements that help a visitor not to get lost in it.\u201d \u2018Some people cry\u2019 Tourists seem as fond of the statue as locals. Deemed one of the seven modern wonders of the world, the Christ the Redeemer is Rio\u2019s most visited attraction, says tour guide Cristina Arroio. Her guests \u201cthink it\u2019s amazing. Some people are very sensitive and they cry. Some say it\u2019s a dream come true to go all the way up and be close to the statue,\u201d she says. Gilson Martins, who can see the statue from his home, calls it \u201cthe carioca host that welcomes Rio, Brazil and the world with open arms.\u201d \u201cThe atmosphere of Rio is formed by an intense energy of human warmth, relaxation, joy, lightness, sensuality, and receptivity,\u201d he says. \u201cChrist on top of Corcovado is the accomplice to all this carioca spirit. It complements all the beauty of the beaches, the Sugarloaf Mountain, the carnival, the samba dancers, and the entire carioca way of being.\u201d How fitting for laid-back, multicultural Brazil, that a sculpture built as a symbol of one religion has ended up representing the welcoming atmosphere of the entire country. Maybe that\u2019s the ultimate miracle of Christ the Redeemer.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/christ-redeemer-rio-de-janeiro-brazil-history/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}

There are many factors to consider, with cost undoubtedly high on the list. But which international city is the most expensive in the world for expats to move to? Hong Kong has once again taken the title of most costly city for overseas workers in the 2024 Mercer Cost of Living Survey, which was released Monday. The Asian city, which also topped the annual list in 2022 and 2023, was closely followed by Singapore, in second place. Much of the rest of the top 10 was taken up by Swiss cities, with Zurich, Geneva, Basel and Bern coming in third, fourth, fifth and sixth place respectively. Rising housing costs The report examined 226 cities based on the comparative cost of over 200 items in each location, including transportation, food, clothing, household goods and entertainment. New York was the highest US city, taking seventh place, while UK capital London, which was in\u00a017th place last year, jumped to eighth place. Nassau, The Bahamas took ninth place, with Los Angeles rounding out the top 10. According to the report, expensive housing markets and increased costs for transportation, goods and services are among the reasons why the cost of living in the top ranking cities is particularly high. \u201cThe cost of housing is a major factor in the Cost of Living City Ranking,\u201d reads the study, pointing out that employees who spend a significant slice of their income on rent or mortgages will have \u201cless disposable income for other expenses.\u201d \u201cBetween 2023 and 2024, there was a lot of volatility in this cost around the world, with housing rental prices varying significantly between cities.\u201d Additionally, \u201cinflation and exchange-rate fluctuations\u201d were noted to have directly impacted the \u201cpay and savings\u201d of international workers. At 92, Toronto was ranked as the most expensive city in Canada for international employees, followed by Vancouver at 101. Financial impacts While the top of the list changed little from the previous year\u2019s rankings, there were some considerably big jumps further down. Among them were Mexico\u2019s Mexico City and Monterrey, with the former moving up 46 places to number 33, and the latter climbing 40 places to 115. The study also noted that the cost of living in the US was \u201ca significant issue\u201d for 2024, with seven US cities appearing in the top 20. \u201cAs US-based companies continue to source talent globally, inflationary pressures may give some inbound foreign nationals pause to accept a position in some of the high-cost cities and metro areas in the US,\u201d says Vince Cordova, partner and mobility advisory leader at Mercer US. \u201cTherefore, we believe employers should be open about sharing the cost of living and net pay information with prospective staff so they can better understand the financial impacts of relocating to the US, and make a fully informed decision on whether or not to move ahead.\u201d The cities that ranked the lowest for living costs were Pakistan\u2019s Islamabad and Nigeria\u2019s Lagos and Abuja. However, this was said to be partly driven by \u201ccurrency depreciations.\u201d The price of a dozen large eggs, a liter of olive oil and an espresso coffee at a popular caf\u00e9 were among the 200 products taken into consideration when determining the rankings for the cost of living in each of the cities. According to the study, the price of olive oil was the most notable hike on average. \u201cCost-of-living challenges have had a significant impact on multinational organizations and their employees,\u201d\u00a0Yvonne Traber, Mercer\u2019s global mobility leader, said in a statement. \u201cIt is important for organizations to stay informed about cost-of-living trends and inflation rates and seek input from employees on these issues to effectively manage their effects.\u201d 2024 cost of living city ranking 1.

{"id": "2024_05_30_travel_krasota-restaurant-multisensory-artificial-intelligence-hnk-spc-intl", "text": "In a dark, round dining room, the late French chef Paul Bocuse explains the next dish. It has all the hallmarks of the classic fine-dining cuisine Bocuse was famed for: quail and foie gras, wrapped in mushroom pat\u00e9 and pastry, and lavished with truffle sauce. But at Krasota, a fine-dining restaurant in Dubai, nothing is what it seems. Bocuse is not physically there; he\u2019s been dead for six years. Instead, it\u2019s his likeness projected onto the room\u2019s curved walls, before dissolving into the dark. This dish, from the recipe to the wall projection to the deep fake video of Bocuse, was designed by artificial intelligence (AI). It\u2019s one of eight courses in \u201cImaginary Futures,\u201d a multisensory dining experience at Krasota. The experience takes diners through different scenarios of what the future could look like, from an underwater city to a space colony to a post-nuclear apocalypse, with each dish themed for its setting. For its AI scenario, Krasota\u2019s co-founders \u2014\u00a0digital artist Anton Nenashev, chef Vladimir Mukhin, and entrepreneur Boris Zarkov \u2014 ceded control to technology. Nenashev, who designs the projections with 3D computer graphics software, let the AI come up with 150 different concepts, before merging together the best; and Mukhin prompted generative platform Midjourney to reimagine Bocuse\u2019s most iconic recipes, including his signature truffle V.G.E soup. \u201cWe drew inspiration from the intriguing prospect of AI (re)creating individuals based on comprehensive data about their lives and experiences,\u201d explains Zarkov. He describes it as a digital-age s\u00e9ance that evokes the memories and style of the late chef through technology \u2014 and it\u2019s just the beginning for the future of dining, he says. \u201cLiving hand-in-hand with artificial intelligence has shifted from fantasy to reality,\u201d Zarkov adds. \u2018First of its kind\u2019 Zarkov, the restauranteur behind the acclaimed White Rabbit in Moscow (where Mukhin is also head chef and co-founder), came up with the idea for Krasota while visiting teamLabs digital art museum in Tokyo in 2017, which featured an interactive \u201ctea house\u201d experience. \u201cThe projection on the table was very simple \u2014 for example, you take the matcha tea and it\u2019s like the tree starts to grow from your cup,\u201d Zarkov explains. \u201cI decided to do something more with the technology: more (food-focused), more complicated.\u201d Assembling an international team of engineers, they began working on multi-surface projections and an AI-enabled interactive tabletop that uses sensors to distinguish between different objects, such as plates and glasses, versus guests\u2019 hands or phones, which allows targeted projection \u2014 for example, fireflies that \u201cgather\u201d on glasses and plates, or an arcade game activated by the diner\u2019s hand. \u201cThis was the most difficult, complicated technology we made,\u201d says Zarkov. He claims the technology was \u201cthe first of its kind\u201d when Krasota initially launched in Moscow in 2021, and recalls staff spending a full month training the AI by repeatedly putting plates down on the table and moving objects to test it. \u201cAt first, it was not very fast \u2014 when you moved your phone, it would take three seconds to react,\u201d says Zarkov. But AI uses machine learning to improve when it receives new information. \u201cNow you can play with any images on the table. It\u2019s like it\u2019s alive,\u201d he adds. Krasota Dubai opened in 2023 with one show, \u201cImaginary Art,\u201d which takes diners through eight courses inspired by famous works by international artists. Six months later, the team launched \u201cImaginary Future,\u201d a speculative voyage through the world in the coming decades. Getting the pacing of the show right was tricky, says Zarkov. \u201cIt\u2019s important to make the focus on the screen, or on the food,\u201d he says, adding, \u201cWhen you have a lot of focus on the screen, your food becomes popcorn.\u201d The experience carefully directs diners\u2019 attention: the most exciting and dynamic visuals are in the breaks between courses, and when food arrives, the graphics become repetitive and passive. The interactive elements only come to the fore when the plates are cleared, and in case there\u2019s any confusion, the human staff (dressed in eccentric thematic costumes) help focus on the correct medium. Whether it\u2019s the food or the screens, Zarkov hopes guests take away that \u201cart is important. We want them to feel it.\u201d \u2018Sonic seasoning\u2019 Technology at the dinner table isn\u2019t an entirely new concept. In 2007, The Fat Duck by Heston Blumenthal in the UK introduced \u201cthe sound of the sea\u201d \u2014 a now-famous dish of shellfish sashimi, plated on an edible sandy shoreline, accompanied by a mini-iPod stuck in a conch shell and earphones playing the sound of waves crashing gently on the beach and the cry of seagulls. It was one of the first technology-enabled multisensory dishes in the world, says Charles Spence, a professor of experimental psychology at the University of Oxford. He\u2019s spent the last two decades exploring how audio-visual stimuli change how food tastes \u2014 or at least, our perception of it. For example, classical melodies will make you think the food is more expensive, and music that matches the cuisine \u2014 for example, Italian songs with a pasta or pizza dish \u2014 will increase the perception of authenticity. In one experiment, Spence found participants rated the same wine \u201cabout 15% sweeter and fruitier with red lighting, compared to when it\u2019s the green light, which brings out the freshness and the acidity instead.\u201d Even the pitch of music can impact the taste, Spence adds: low-pitched sounds will make something taste more bitter, while tinkling, high-pitched notes will bring out the sweetness. \u201cMore and more chefs are deliberately introducing this kind of \u2018sonic seasoning\u2019 to modify the taste of their food,\u201d says Spence, adding that there\u2019s a growing interest from consumers eagers to explore the \u201csurprising connections\u201d between their different senses. Technology is becoming more common in these multisensory experiences. Restaurants like Zenon, also in Dubai, use \u201cAI-generated art installations\u201d to change the mood of the dining room, and private dining room Jing in Hong Kong explores the ancient Song Dynasty through an immersive dinner experience with projections and a lighting scheme. Multisensory goes sci-fi Most multisensory dining experiences, often hosted at high-end venues and conceptualized by world-class chefs, are expensive and inaccessible. (Krasota\u2019s show starts from 1,200 dirhams, around $326.) But Spence likens it to \u201cthe Formula One of food,\u201d where the best dishes and experiences will \u201cpercolate down to the mainstream.\u201d And that\u2019s already happening: Fanta\u2019s \u201cTikTok experience\u201d asked consumers to explore how the flavor of its special edition drink changed with different stimuli, and Spence is working with Italian food manufacturer Barilla on soundscapes for different pasta types. In the future, Spence sees more companies integrating sensory experiences \u2014 perhaps QR codes on products that link to a playlist to enhance the taste. Zarkov\u2019s vision of the future is a little more sci-fi: he speculates that ultimately, brain chips will trick your mind into presenting your senses with whatever your heart desires. \u201cIn your mind, it looks like the best California sushi rolls you\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d says Zarkov. But really, the dish is \u201cbiomass,\u201d with the precise nutrients, vitamins, and minerals your body needs. But if people are plugged into their own hyper-optimized world, if the dishes on the table don\u2019t look the same to your partner as they do to you, if the decor is different, does dining lose its communal and social aspect? \u201cAny technology that interferes with the social aspects of dining will not succeed,\u201d such as headsets or goggles, says Spence. \u201cPeople mostly want to talk with each other; dining is fundamentally a social activity.\u201d Zarkov agrees that the \u201cmain goal is still socializing\u201d and Krasota avoids technology like VR that could be disruptive to the experience. One element the team is currently testing is projecting a \u201clive skin\u201d onto people\u2019s hands, giving them a different aesthetic, like a scaly fish \u2014 but designing it to move with the person is still \u201cvery complicated,\u201d says Zarkov.\u00a0 Krasota is continuing to develop new ideas and experiment with its projection tech. Its next show, expected to launch in early 2025, is inspired by \u201cAlice in Wonderland,\u201d and will \u201cuse a lot of AI in the production, because they made a huge step forward in the technology last year,\u201d says Zarkov, adding: \u201cWe can now \u2018resurrect\u2019 images of people, use AI in creative processes, and either embrace or fear this collaborative dynamic.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/travel/krasota-restaurant-multisensory-artificial-intelligence-hnk-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_dubai-viral-chocolate-bar-fix-hnk-spc", "text": "On TikTok, gooey, crunchy, loaded chocolate bars are going viral. Bursting with unusual fillings such as filo pastry, vanilla custard, or tea and biscuits, these chunky chocolate bars originate from Fix Dessert Chocolatier. \u201cWe take a lot of time and effort, and put a lot of love into our bars,\u201d says Sarah Hamouda, founder of Fix. It\u2019s not just a chocolate bar, she says: \u201cWe want to create an experience.\u201d The 38-year-old, who has been Dubai-based for nine years, launched the brand in 2021 as a side hustle. Inspired by her pregnancy cravings, the British Egyptian entrepreneur set out to create something more than the \u201ctypical\u201d chocolate fix. And it\u2019s proven hugely popular: a now-viral ASMR video of TikTok food influencer Maria Vehera eating a bar in her car has been viewed more than 56 million times to date, and hundreds of people have since filmed their own reactions to the bars, or created recipe guides trying to replicate it at home The buzz around the brand has been \u201cunreal,\u201d says Hamouda, adding that Fix\u2019s daily orders went from single digits to 500. \u201cTo be honest, not at any point did I think this was going to become global,\u201d says Hamouda, adding that she\u2019s had messages and video responses from people from Canada to Argentina to Romania. \u201cIt\u2019s insane what\u2019s been happening.\u201d Choc-full of flavor As the bars are handmade \u2014 including colorful designs painted on each one \u2014 there\u2019s a limit to how much the team can produce. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s really important (to maintain) the quality and the ingredients of our products,\u201d she says, adding that the secret to her bars is the signature mold she uses to shape the chocolate and pack in the filling. Part of the appeal of Fix\u2019s bars is the creative names, which Hamouda\u2019s husband comes up with, and the uniquely Middle Eastern flavors, like dates, karak (a spiced tea blend), and knafeh, a traditional Arabic dessert made with shredded pastry, pistachios, sweet soft cheese, and syrup. Dubai\u2019s international, expat-heavy population inspired some of the flavors, too, such as \u201cMind your own Buiscoff,\u201d a white chocolate bar packed with crunchy Lotus cheesecake spread, or \u201cCereously Chewsy,\u201d a slab of milk chocolate stuffed with Nutella fudge brownies, custard and cereal. A choco-lot of demand FIX \u2014 which stands for \u201cfreaking incredible experience\u201d \u2014 is currently only available in Dubai. And with international attention, that\u2019s become a big problem. \u201cKeeping up with the demand has definitely been a challenge,\u201d Hamouda says. Since the video began trending in February this year, the company has scaled up, from just Hamouda and her husband operating out of their home to a team of 10 in a rented kitchen. The 200-gram chocolate bars, which retail for $20 each, are only available through food delivery service Deliveroo, with sales going live at 5pm daily. Capped at 500 orders each day, Hamouda says they usually sell out within minutes. While this might be an enviable problem, Hamouda says there has been backlash online, with customers complaining about the scarcity of the bars and criticizing the hype as a marketing ploy. The shortage has led to many candy bars inspired by \u201cDubai\u2019s viral chocolate\u201d hitting online retail platforms, and home chefs are giving it a go themselves. While some might worry about the competition, Hamouda is flattered. \u201cWe get messages from people saying, \u2018thank you for inspiring us to be creative at home,\u2019 so that\u2019s something that I\u2019m proud of,\u201d she says. Fan\u2019s desperation to try the unusual flavors and textures has led to a \u201cchocolate black market\u201d with the bars showing up in South Africa at exorbitant prices. Hamouda is awed by the response \u2014 and hints that Fix will be making its way to international markets very soon. \u201cWe have a lot in the pipeline,\u201d she says. \u201cEvery trend has its moment. But I think we have so much more to give and I think this is just the beginning for us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/dubai-viral-chocolate-bar-fix-hnk-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}

Welcome to another summer in Europe. From the headlines, things already look chaotic. Famous sites are raising their entry fees. Hotel rooms are like gold dust. And the dollar has slipped against both the pound and the euro. Oh, and there\u2019s the small matter of crowds. \u201cThere\u2019s been a substantial increase on last year\u2019s demand,\u201d says Tom Jenkins, CEO of the European Tourism Organisation, speaking about US travelers to Europe. \u201c2023 saw higher numbers than 2019, and this year we\u2019re comfortably seeing more \u2013 record volumes of Americans coming to Europe.\u201d Kayla Zeigler agrees. As the owner of Destination Europe, she is sending \u201crecord numbers\u201d of clients to the continent this year. Graham Carter, director of Unforgettable Travel, a tour operator with a 90% US client base, says that many guests are finding the idea of Europe prohibitively expensive this year. \u201cPeople are wondering, is Europe worth it?\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s booking up in advance and prices are quite high. There\u2019s been such a huge demand for travel in the past three years, and lots of places are pushing up prices.\u201d Is summer in Europe already a washout? According to the experts, that all depends on what kind of sacrifices you\u2019re prepared to make. A weak dollar First things first: travelers from the US are already at a disadvantage due to a weak dollar. Against the euro, $1 was worth around 91 or 92 euro cents as of June 5, at mid-market rates. Sure, that\u2019s better than the December 2020-January 2021 five-year low when the dollar was hovering around 82 cents. But it\u2019s also down from a year earlier, when a dollar was worth about 95 euro cents \u2013 and it\u2019s way down from last September\u2019s five-year high when it peaked at 1.04 euros, according to currency conversion specialists Wise. For those traveling to the UK it\u2019s a similar state of affairs. This time last year, $1 netted travelers 80 pence. As of Wednesday, it was 78p \u2013 a fall from the September peak of nearly 83p. The dollar is also down, year on year, against 11 more European currencies. From Bosnia to Bulgaria, Denmark to Iceland, Poland to Romania and Sweden to Switzerland, travelers changing dollars will be worse off. While a few cents to the dollar doesn\u2019t sound much on a single transaction, the small drops can make a difference on credit card bills on the return home. A 500 euro hotel room equates to $543 at Friday\u2019s mid-market exchange rate, where it would have been $480 in September. It\u2019s not all bad, though. In Europe it is up against three currencies: the Czech koruna (21.9 koruna to the dollar last year, to 22.7 currently), the Hungarian forint (from 344.7 to the dollar last year, to 359.4 this year), and the Ukrainian hryvnia, though few will be considering Ukraine for a vacation this year. One currency the dollar is unusually strong against is the Turkish lira. Last June, visitors were swapping one dollar for 21 lira; this week, they\u2019re getting 32. \u2018Spectacular\u2019 hotel price hikes\u2026 On the ground, inflation is up, and entrance fees are rising. The Eiffel Tower will put up prices by 20% from June 17, Istanbul\u2019s Hagia Sophia now charges 25 euros for entry; Venice is charging day-trippers 5 euros on peak dates. Entry fees pale in comparison to hotel bills however. Jenkins says that prices have risen \u201cquite spectacularly\u201d in major cities, and Tim Hentschel, CEO of HotelPlanner.com, agrees. \u201cA lot of the time we\u2019re seeing hotels for $500 a night that were $300 last year,\u201d he says. However, that\u2019s not necessarily because hotels have randomly increased their prices. It\u2019s down to high occupancy levels, he says. As hotels fill up, their remaining rooms get more expensive. \u201cIt\u2019s become, how much can the hotel sell that last 10% of inventory. Rates really begin to spike because of compression,\u201d he says. \u201cSo once you hit 90% occupancy, a $350 room can spike to $500. It\u2019s not like the whole hotel sold at $500 \u2013 a lot sold at $250. It\u2019s the procrastinators paying $500.\u201d He should know \u2013 he\u2019s a self-described procrastinator. Data from Hotel Monitor, American Express Global Business Travel\u2019s annual analysis of worldwide hotel rates, backs his theory up. Its industry predictions for 2024 suggest many major European cities should see room rates increasing by around 10%. Paris, Amsterdam and Dublin were all predicted to be 10-11% higher, with Berlin, Stockholm, Barcelona and London all up by over 9%. Bottom line: stop procrastinating. The good news is that Hentschel says that these price hikes aren\u2019t across the board; instead, they\u2019re at the higher end. That\u2019s why his advice is to drop down the star ratings to find a good deal. \u201cOne and two star hotels don\u2019t have the pricing power,\u201d he says. The same goes for hotels a little further from the destination. \u201cGo to Murcia not Marbella, Milos instead of Mykonos,\u201d he says. \u201cYou get the same sunsets, the same Instagram pictures for a tenth of the price. These aren\u2019t downgrades \u2013 they are places that haven\u2019t made the top 10 list of Conde Nast for the past 10 years.\u201d If you\u2019re looking to stay in a city, try a town further out, he says. In London, for example, five stars are hitting as much as \u00a31,000 (about $1,270) per night. \u201cBut if you go outside the M25 (London\u2019s outer ringroad), three- and four-star hotels are having a tough time getting \u00a3100 a night.\u201d His top tip for London? Windsor, home to the royals and just 29 minutes by train from Paddington station. The sweet spot? A three star hotel in a secondary destination. That should net you a good deal \u2013 even in the terrible summer of 2024, he says. \u2026But cheaper airfares It may not feel like it, but US-Europe airfares are trending lower, says Hayley Berg, lead economist at Hopper. Her data \u2013 which collates all worldwide flight fare searches \u2013 shows that the average air fare from the US to Europe this summer is down 16% on 2023 to $892 round trip. In fact, she says, \u201cEurope is on sale this year.\u201d For the major destinations, it\u2019s even better. Hopper data from June shows that the average return flight from the US to London is down 21%, year on year. On the continent, prime destinations Rome, Barcelona, Athens, and Paris have all seen whopping double-figure drops: by 34%, 37%, 28% and 38% respectively for fares in June, July and August. None of these fares are exactly giveaways. Prices are still higher than in 2019, but are aligned with 2017 and 2018, suggesting that the wild post-pandemic price hikes might be over. Berg calls it \u201ca path back to normal prices.\u201d Far from the madding crowds Did someone mention the crowds? With numbers spiking and anti-tourism measures in place from Venice\u2019s daytripper fee to Mallorcan residents staging protests, some people want to stay away from the obvious European destinations. Jenkins speaks of a \u201csoftening in demand\u201d for the \u201cmain cultural cities.\u201d Carter\u2019s clients try to avoid July and August because of the crowds and heat, preferring May, June and September. But even in those less-busy months, crowds are a concern this year. \u201cWe\u2019re getting a lot of people wanting to avoid the Venices, Romes, Florences,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople are saying, \u2018We still want to visit Italy but we want to avoid the crowds.\u2019\u201d They\u2019re doing the right thing. 2023 saw 134 million \u201carrivals\u201d in Italy \u2013 the highest visitor numbers in history, according to data from Italy\u2019s tourism ministry. Half of those were foreign visitors, and the signs are that 2024 will surpass them, thanks to what tourism minister Daniela Santanch\u00e8 has called a \u201ctargeted strategy.\u201d Zeigler says that any client booking a popular destination this year is getting a reality check before they go. \u201cWe prepare our clients who are visiting tourist-heavy destinations about the crowds, and in many cases we plan their touring and activities around peak crowd times for them to try to have the most pleasant experience possible,\u201d she says, adding that she is booking them accommodation slightly outside of the prime locations: Praiano and Ravello, for example, instead of Amalfi and Positano, for those visiting the Amalfi Coast. Carter is sending his reluctant travelers to more rural regions, like Puglia and Sicily, or advising them to try a different country entirely \u2013 Slovenia instead of Italy (for its mountains and wineries) and Croatia instead of the Greek islands. Ireland and Portugal are also increasingly popular for his clients. Jenkins has a novel suggestion: France. Olympics host cities tend to see a drop in tourism around the Games, he says \u2013 and since Paris is the main attraction for visitors to France, he thinks regional France will be less busy than usual. His prediction appears to be coming true: although the Amex GBT analysis predicted a 11% spike in Paris hotel rates this year, so far they have only risen 8%. That 38% drop in airfare to the city\u2019s Charles de Gaulle airport is looking very tempting. For those sticking to the usual destinations, add-ons and activities are where travelers are really being hit this year, says Hentschel, who just booked an Amalfi Coast trip for a client \u2013 including a 60-minute massage for $400. \u201cTravel is at historic highs and inflation is high,\u201d he says. \u201cActivities have skyrocketed.\u201d They\u2019re also selling out fast \u2013 so if you\u2019re wanting to book, be quick. Zeigler says that on-the-ground costs are around 30% more than they were in 2019 for her clients. Is now too late? So is there still time to plan a European summer, or is it too late? Book that flight fast, advises Berg; prices are only going to go up. Or, \u201cIf you\u2019re flexible, go for September\u201d \u2013 she predicts a similar year-on-year fare drop in addition to the regular 10-30% autumn price fall. Alternatively, wait a year \u2013 Berg predicts that US-Europe fares will remain the same or go down for 2025. Hentschel advises late bookers to try \u201calternative accommodation\u201d \u2013 dropping a star rating, staying further away, or trying something like a B&B. Carter says that there are still \u201cpockets\u201d of availability in July and August but warns that clients shouldn\u2019t expect last-minute deals. But with refreshing honesty, he advises people to wait. \u201cI just wouldn\u2019t bother with summer \u2013 I\u2019d look at autumn 2024 or spring 2025 if you want to get some value out of the trip. \u201cI think summer this year, you\u2019re just going to get stung.\u201d As Hentschel says, \u201cThe further in advance you book, the more you save.\u201d As numbers continue to rise in Europe, make that your travel motto for the future.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/travel/europe-summer-2024-travel-crowds/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_worlds-50-best-restaurants-for-2024", "text": "Any doubts that Spain remains the fine dining center of the world may just have evaporated with the revealing of the World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants for 2024 list. Five eateries from the European nation made the list \u2013 three of them in the top five. The awards\u00a0\u2013 considered the Oscars of global fine dining \u2013 were handed out at a ceremony at the Wynn in Las Vegas on Wednesday evening, with Barcelona\u2019s Disfrutar walking away with the top prize. Ranked number two last year, it\u2019s owned and run by chefs Oriol Castro, Eduard Xatruch and Mateu Casanas. The fact that this trio met while working at the legendary El Bulli should provide a few clues as to what diners can expect \u2013 imaginative and playful dishes executed with technical mastery, such as the caviar-filled Panchino doughnut, the frozen gazpacho sandwich and squab with kombu spaghetti, almond and grape. Coming in at number two was Asador Etxebarri of Atxondo, not far from the Spanish port city of Bilbao. Under the leadership of chef Victor Arguinzoniz, it\u2019s famed for offering unbeatable barbecue that lets the quality of the ingredients shine, such as a red Palam\u00f3s prawn that\u2019s simply grilled and served on its own. But you can never count Paris out.\u00a0The French capital\u2019s Table by Bruno Verjus\u00a0squeezed into third place, while yet another restaurant from Spain \u2013 Madrid\u2019s Diverxo \u2013 took the fourth spot. Coming in at fifth was Lima\u2019s Maido, one of three restaurants from the city to make the list, giving the Peruvian capital\u2019s reputation as South America\u2019s premier dining destination yet another boost. Mexico was the big winner in North America, earning three restaurants on the list, led by Mexico City eatery Quintonil, which came in seventh. The rest of the list Securing five restaurants on the list was enough to make Spain the biggest winner of the night in Vegas. In terms of cities, Paris and Bangkok tied for first, each with four restaurants on the list. Gaggan Anand, at number nine, was the Thai capital\u2019s top entry. As for the event\u2019s host country, the US had two restaurants on this year\u2019s 50 Best list. New York City\u2019s Atomix came in 6th this year, rising two spots since last year. SingleThread, in the town of Healdsburg in California\u2019s Sonoma Valley, landed in 46th place. Three restaurants from Tokyo were awarded, with eatery S\u00e9zanne\u00a0(voted Asia\u2019s best restaurant in 2024) ranking the highest in the Japanese capital, at 15. Hong Kong saw two of its restaurants hit the list, with both making impressive moves. Wing was the city\u2019s highest new entry on the entire list, at 20, while The Chairman was the highest climber, moving from last year\u2019s 50th spot into number 26. The list is compiled based on the votes of the\u00a0The World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants Academy, which is made up of\u00a0 1,080 international restaurant industry experts including food writers and chefs, in 27 regions around the world. Restaurants can only win the top prize once, after which they\u2019re entered into a separate \u201cBest of the Best\u201d program. Members of that elite group include Geranium and Noma in Copenhagen, as well as New York\u2019s Eleven Madison Park, The Fat Duck near London, Osteria Francescana in Modena, Italy, and Mirazur in Menton, France. Last year\u2019s winner, Central of Lima, Peru, now joins them on that list. The world\u2019s 50 best restaurants 2024 1. Disfrutar\u00a0(Barcelona, Spain) 2.

Instead, they found themselves trapped inside a grounded plane for more than three hours, according to passenger Garth Collins, who posted about his experience on Instagram. Not only that, but the passengers were stuck inside the closed metal vessel without air conditioning, Collins said, as temperatures outside soared above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius), leading to passengers \u201cliterally dehydrating and passing out on the plane.\u201d Greece has been gripped by a blistering heatwave in the past week, causing popular tourist sites like the Acropolis to be closed to the public. British television personality Michael Mosley was found dead on the Greek island of Symi after he went for a walk in high temperatures last Wednesday. This week, two other tourists also disappeared on separate hikes elsewhere in the country, authorities have said. In a video posted by Collins, passengers can be seen standing up from their seats and in the aisles of the plane, fanning themselves and fellow passengers with paper. CNN has reached out to Collins for further comment. Athens International Airport told CNN that the flight was grounded while ready for departure due to \u201csudden unexpected technical issues.\u201d Qatar Airways said it \u201csincerely apologizes for the delay to passengers travelling on flight QR204 from Athens (ATH) to Doha (DOH) on Monday 10 June 2024, which was due to a technical issue,\u201d in a statement shared with CNN. Australian passenger Jennie Zeiher was onboard the plane with her husband Joe, planning to fly on from Doha to Melbourne, Australia. Speaking to CNN affiliate 7News after she arrived in Melbourne, Zeiher said she didn\u2019t understand why the passengers were allowed to board. \u2018I\u2019m a frequent flyer, I travel regularly, and I just don\u2019t understand why we were allowed to board in the first place,\u201d Zeiher said, according to 7News. \u201cNot to mention what unfolded afterwards. It was just horrendous.\u201d 7News reports that passengers took their shirts off to deal with the heat, with a few cups of water being handed out in the cabin. \u201cThe flight attendants were doing the best they could given the situation,\u201d Zeiher told 7News, adding that \u201cit seemed like they didn\u2019t know any more than we did about what was going on.\u201d Eventually, the passengers disembarked the plane. Collins says he was on the plane for around three and a half hours, while Zeiher said she was onboard for around four. Zeiher told 7News that she received \u201czero information\u201d from Qatar Airways, so she decided to rebook her onward flight to Australia through Emirates. According to flight tracking website Flightradar24, flight QR204 was supposed to leave Athens International Airport at 1:55 p.m. local time. It eventually departed at 6:44 a.m. the following morning, landing at Doha\u2019s Hamad International\u00a0Airport at 10:35 a.m. local time. Qatar Airways told CNN that, as a result of the technical issue, \u201call passengers were asked to disembark the aircraft and were supported by our staff at Athens International Airport while ground maintenance teams worked to resolve the issue.\u201d \u201cThe flight later departed from ATH, arriving in DOH at 10.39 local time on Tuesday 11 June 2024, where we extended our full support to all affected passengers upon arrival to ensure smooth onward connections to their final destination,\u201d it continued. \u201cWe regard the safety and comfort of our passengers and crew as our highest priority at all times, and have offered our apologies to each passenger affected by this unforeseen disruption and the inconvenience caused.

{"id": "travel_shibuya-city-tokyo-public-drinking-ban-intl-hnk", "text": "One of Tokyo\u2019s most popular tourist neighborhoods is making a move to curb bad behavior \u2013 by taking alcohol indoors. The measure, which is expected to take effect in October, will see drinking alcohol forbidden on streets or public places in Shibuya from 6 p.m. to 5 a.m. every day. The legal drinking age in Japan is 20. Shibuya City, which is a self-governed district within Tokyo, can make its own local regulations. Mayor Ken Hasebe recently told journalists: \u201cWe have been stepping up patrols and other efforts over the last year, but we have had people say, \u2018Well, the rules say you can drink, don\u2019t they?\u2019 By establishing the rule, we would like to convey the district\u2019s intentions, including during patrols \u2014 we would prefer people to enjoy their drinks inside restaurants.\u201d This news may not come as a surprise to local residents. Last fall, Shibuya banned Halloween-related activities in the district, with alcohol cited as a main reason behind the prohibition. That included a ban on drinking alcohol outside of bars and restaurants. Mayor Hasebe says that local businesses supported the regulations in October 2023 and were behind the push to make them permanent. \u201cThe damage caused by overtourism has become serious, resulting in property damage caused by drinking in the street, altercations with local residents, and littering of large amounts of empty cans and bottles,\u201d the city said in a statement last October. Shibuya is home to some of the capital\u2019s most popular attractions, including the Meiji Shrine, Yoyogi Park and the \u201cShibuya scramble,\u201d believed to be the world\u2019s busiest intersection. Japan has struggled to cope with overtourism since fully reopening post-pandemic. More than three million visitors visited the country in both April and May of this year, with the trend likely to continue through the summer. Educating visitors on the local culture has been a large component of dealing with the influx of international tourists. In the historic city of Kyoto, where it\u2019s possible to spot geisha and their apprentices (maiko) around the ancient alleyways, locals have tried to find ways to deter foreigners from harassing the women as they make their way to and from work. Kyoto\u2019s official tourism office has put up posters and distributed pamphlets about different social customs in Japan, from how to use toilets to whether to tip. The advice also extends to geisha, with visitors asked not to touch the women, pull on their kimonos, or take their photos without permission. Local Gion residents have also taken some measures themselves, such as blocking off private alleys. Despite those measures, though, \u201cgeisha paparazzi\u201d and other nuisance tourists still cause conflict between visitors and locals.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/shibuya-city-tokyo-public-drinking-ban-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_travel_bolivia-cuisine-top-restaurants-dishes", "text": "Bolivia doesn\u2019t seem like an obvious foodie destination. But the big, landlocked South American country is making waves in the culinary world via top-notch restaurants and transforming foodways pioneered by the ancient Inca and Aymara peoples into modern fusion dishes. Capital city La Paz boasts three eateries \u2014 Gustu, Ancestral and Phayawi \u2014 currently ranked among the top 100 restaurants in Latin America. And more are waiting in the wings. And it\u2019s not just La Paz. Bolivia\u2019s food revolution has also spread to major cities such as Sucre as well as the Uyuni Salt Flats. The new Bolivian cuisine kicked off about a decade ago, according to Marsia Taha, head chef at Gustu. \u201cThere was a generation of new chefs that had a mindset that we should be proud about our identity and our culture and our food,\u201d Taha said. Taha and other likeminded chefs in La Paz coalesced around the concept of \u201czero-kilometer cuisine\u201d \u2014 using as many ingredients as possible that are raised or grown locally and having direct contact with the ranchers or farmers that provide those things. \u201cBy showing that we believe in local products, we were able to show people that Bolivian cuisine could be as great as things coming from outside the country,\u201d adds Sebasti\u00e1n Gim\u00e9nez, chef and co-owner of Ancestral. Revolutionizing Bolivian cuisine It\u2019s not surprising that Gustu has been counted among the continent\u2019s elite dining destinations since first opening its doors in 2013. Co-founder Claus Meyer is a Danish culinary legend who helped pioneer the New Nordic food movement at the Michelin three-star Noma restaurant in Copenhagen, and Gustu is always mentioned among the continent\u2019s top restaurants. Merging Bolivia\u2019s traditional ingredients and food culture with the contemporary Nordic model, Taha and Meyer fashioned a gastronomic melting pot that truly lives up to its name (gustu means \u201cdelicious\u201d in the Quechua language of the Andes). Among the signature dishes are raw Lake Titicaca trout with mango; llama with Amazonian vanilla and ajipa root; Amazon fish with goldenberries and a fermented yuca (cassava); and an out-of-this-world lamb tamale. Taha says that even after a decade in business, she and Gustu\u2019s other chefs are able to keep the concept fresh by traveling around Bolivia to learn about new ingredients and foodways. \u201cLearning how people cook, how they grow their food, and so on. We also give a lot of liberty to our chefs to bring in new ideas.\u201d Variations on the theme Located in the trendy Achumani neighborhood on the south side of La Paz, Ancestral occupies a cozy basement location with floor-to-ceiling windows looking out on a sunken garden. The food is new Bolivian with Basque and Nordic undertones, but the concept is open fire or parrilla-style cooking that revolves around the wood-stoked grill and oven. \u201cWe\u2019re inspired by the biodiversity of Bolivia,\u201d says chef Sebasti\u00e1n Gim\u00e9nez. \u201cWe have jungle, valleys, altiplano, and very high places. We are also inspired by local products and local techniques. We only use Bolivian products, and we only serve Bolivian wines.\u201d But don\u2019t expect traditional Andean or Amazon dishes. Ancestral offers a delicious fusion of old and new in offerings such as the chulet\u00f3n ribeye steak, trout ceviche with grilled corn and sweet potato, and porchetta pork roast with Bolivian tubers and red aji sauce. Manq\u2019a takes another tack. Rather than fine dining, the ambience is decidedly casual, the tables spread across three floors of an old wooden townhouse in the boho Sopocachi neighborhood of central La Paz. It\u2019s especially busy at lunch, a mixed bag of local shoppers, politicians, students and the occasional tourist savoring dishes such as sopa de man\u00ed (peanut soup), gratinated cheese and native potatoes with humacha sauce, soft baked keper\u00ed beef from eastern Bolivia, and surubi catfish from the Amazon served with quinoa, tucupi cassava and edible flowers. Food of the devil The chefs at these top-shelf restaurants don\u2019t have to look far for basic ingredients. Many of the building blocks of their fusion foods are native to the Andes valleys and foothills that extend all the way along Bolivia\u2019s western side from Lake Titicaca to Argentina. More than 4,000 potato types are cultivated in Bolivia and its Andean neighbors, many of them found in just a single, small valley. They come in various shapes, sizes, colors and slightly different flavors. Even more than spuds, Bolivians cherish their quinoa. The country boasts more than 3,100 varieties of quinoa, which contrary to popular opinion is actually the seed of a flowering pseudocereal plant rather than a true grain. An exhibit at the new visitor center in the silver mining town of San Crist\u00f3bal points out that Spanish conquistadors and padres considered quinoa the \u201cfood of the devil\u201d and banned its consumption as a way to control the local indigenous people. Five centuries later, NASA declared quinoa \u201cthe perfect food to grow in indoor greenhouses\u201d during long voyages in outer space because of its resistance to adverse conditions (such as growing in the Andes), versatility and high protein content. No longer vilified as Satan\u2019s feast, it\u2019s also an ideal ingredient for Bolivia\u2019s new-wave cuisine. Zero-kilometer goes wider Sucre, the nation\u2019s judicial capital in south-central Bolivia, isn\u2019t as cosmopolitan as La Paz when it comes to food. But it\u2019s gradually catching up. Located across the street from the city\u2019s Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe, Joy Ride Cafe was founded as a tourist restaurant but evolved into a local hangout for date nights, after-work parties and Sucrense craving burgers, pasta and other global eats. But right down the block is the fusion fare of El Solar. The seven-course degustation menu features dishes such as seafood rice flavored with Amazonian citrus juice, pork belly with pepper sauce and a creamy puree made from plantain and yuca; and beef loin with charque (llama jerky). All of this for 80 bolivianos (roughly $12). Located in southwest Bolivia about 300 miles (500 kilometers) south of La Paz, the otherworldly Salar de Uyuni is the world\u2019s largest and most spectacular salt flat as well as Bolivia\u2019s top tourist attraction. Once upon a time, it was primarily a backpacker destination, but in recent years, more well-heeled travelers (and social media influencers) have sparked a transformation of the local dining scene. Tika restaurant at the Jardines de Uyuni Hotel looks ordinary from the outside, but the kitchen creates Andean-inspired dishes that easily match anything found in Bolivia\u2019s big cities. Chef Tania L\u00f3pez also uses the term \u201czero-kilometer cuisine\u201d to describe the menu at Tika. Among her signature dishes are a sun-dried, shredded llama jerky with local white cheese and a piquant yellow chili pepper sauce, bubbling k\u2019alaphurka corn soup, and lake trout filets in a basil pesto \u201clagoon\u201d with quinoa risotto. L\u00f3pez says one of the closest dishes at Tika to what the ancient Inca may have eaten is the llama potojchi. \u201cPreparation takes more time than beef,\u201d she explains of a succulent dish that resembles goulash. \u201cWe still do this in the traditional way from many centuries ago \u2014 heated on lava rocks.\u201d Dishes that the Incas never tasted \u2014 but would probably die for \u2014 are Tika\u2019s house-made desserts, in particular the quinoa and purple corn ice creams. Tika also does upscale takeaway, meals for a remote picnic that diners can enable on their own or via a 4x4 adventure with Hidalgo Tours, which sets up a table, chairs and bar at a remote location in the middle of the salt flat.\u00a0\u00a0 But that\u2019s not to say that Bolivia\u2019s food revolution has reached every nook and cranny. An hour boat ride from the mainland in the middle of Lake Titicaca, the Isla del Sol (Island of the Sun) is the legendary birthplace of Inca civilization and a place still deeply rooted in the Andean past. On its open-air terrace overlooking the water, the island\u2019s Tacana restaurant serves a traditional pachamanca lunch that includes llama, lake fish, potatoes, corn and other locally sourced dishes \u2014 not all that different than what the Inca rulers would have eaten during their pilgrimages to the island more than 500 years ago.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/travel/bolivia-cuisine-top-restaurants-dishes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}

But in recent days, the restrooms in this UNESCO-listed World Heritage site have been earning more attention than the views. A video recently shared on various Chinese news and social media sites shows a set of timers installed above a row of toilet cubicles in a female washroom, with each stall getting its own digital counter. When a stall is unoccupied, the pixelated LED screen displays the word \u201cempty\u201d in green. If in use, it shows the number of minutes and seconds the door has been locked. \u2018We won\u2019t kick people out midway\u2019 The original video was reportedly taken by a visitor who sent it to the\u00a0Xiaoxiang Morning Herald,\u00a0a state-run local newspaper. \u201cI found it quite advanced technologically so you don\u2019t have to queue outside or knock on a bathroom door,\u201d the paper quoted the visitor as saying. \u201cBut I also found it a little bit embarrassing. It felt like I was being monitored.\u201d A staff member at the attraction reportedly told the Xioxiang Morning Herald that the timers were installed to cope with an increase in visitors to the attraction \u2013 and that includes the facilities inside the tourist site. \u201cThey aren\u2019t there to control the durations you could use the bathrooms,\u201d the staff member was quoted by the newspaper as saying. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible that we would kick someone out [of the bathroom stall] midway. And we aren\u2019t setting a time limit such as five or 10 minutes of how long one could use the toilets.\u201d Nanchang Evening News, a state-run newspaper, quoted a staff member of the park\u00a0as saying the timer has been in operation since May 1 of this year and is primarily a safety measure, \u201censuring the well-being of all guests, in case some guests use the toilet for an extended period and an emergency occurs.\u201d The news has stirred up plenty of debate on China\u2019s social media sites. Some netizens on popular micro-blogging platform Weibo supported the new timers, saying they would discourage visitors from sitting and scrolling on their mobile phones while in the stalls. \u201cA tourist site isn\u2019t an office \u2013 who would spend their time in the toilets? Is it really necessary?\u201d said one netizen. \u201cWhy don\u2019t they just spend the money on building more washrooms?\u201d said another. Others said that it would help those who have actual medical emergencies and may not be able to call for assistance. Record-breaking visitor numbers Inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001, Yungang Buddhist Grottoes is one of the biggest attractions in northern China\u2019s Shanxi province. The ticketed scenic area received 3 million visitors in 2023, a record high for the tourist site and a significant increase from its second busiest year, in 2019 (with 1.98 million visits). And Yungang Buddhist Grottoes has been upgrading more than just its washrooms. In recent years, officials have introduced new shows and added new mini-attractions within the area to boost its appeal.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/toilet-timers-china-yungang-buddhist-grottoes-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_four-seasons-gresham-palace-budapest-hotel", "text": "For most of the last century, the story of the Gresham Palace closely mirrored that of the city in which it was built. Built at the turn of the 20th century in prosperous Budapest, it quickly became the Hungarian capital\u2019s hottest address. After enduring two world wars, it suffered neglect under communism before rising majestically, once again, in June 2004 to become one of the city\u2019s, perhaps even central Europe\u2019s, grandest hotels. This summer, the building \u2013 one of the finest examples of Art Nouveau design in Budapest \u2013 is celebrating two decades in its most recent incarnation, as the Four Seasons Gresham Palace, a luxury hotel with panoramic views of the mighty Danube river. The anniversary marks a new milestone in the preservation of this architectural gem that was both ahead of its time when it was built and very much a celebration of the intellectual golden age in which it emerged. The Gresham Palace was conceived around the time that Budapest emerged as one of Europe\u2019s largest cities after the 19th-century unification of affluent Buda on one side of the Danube with rapidly developing Pest on the other, and the absorption of nearby town \u00d3buda. At the time, the Chain Bridge was the main link across the river, and so it was decided to build the palace on the Pest side to act as a kind of bricks-and-mortar gatekeeper. \u201cAfter the unification of Buda, Pest and \u00d3buda in 1873, Budapest became a big cosmopolitan city, a European capital,\u201d J\u00f3zsef Laszlovszky, director of the cultural heritage studies program at Central European University, tells CNN. \u201cBuda and Pest, for a long time, were only connected by the Chain Bridge, thus Sz\u00e9chenyi Square at the end of the bridge on the Pest side was one of the most prominent public spaces with Gresham Palace overlooking them both.\u201d Passionate affair Widely adored today, Gresham\u2019s construction in 1906 was also a story of affection \u2013 it\u2019s also known locally as the \u201cpalace of hearts.\u201d Heart motifs carved into the building were said to be added by the architect, Zsigmond Quittner, because of his love for a future tenant of the palace. Another more probable tale says the hearts were inspired by a passionate affair between Countess Irma Sz\u00e9chenyi and Thomas Gresham, an Englishman behind the building\u2019s construction. Gresham was said to have gifted Sz\u00e9chenyi a heart-shaped pendant which she asked to be woven into the fabric of the palace. Quittner, who won a commission from the Gresham Life Assurance Company, to build the palace, delivered, along with the help of his associate J\u00f3zsef V\u00e1g\u00f3, a prime example of Art Nouveau architecture, infused with the avant-garde flair of Vienna and Paris of that era. It was built to reflect the grandeur of the powerful Austro-Hungarian empire at the time, with lavish interiors and detailed ironwork. Renowned glass-painter and mosaic-maker Miksa Ro\u0301th was also brought in to create ornate exterior glass mosaics and stained glass windows. The palace was not only an architectural triumph but also a hub of technological innovation, featuring central heating and a pioneering dust extraction system. The building also boasted a T-shaped shopping arcade with a glass roof, a novel concept in Budapest in the early 1900s. Upon its completion, Gresham Palace instantly became Budapest\u2019s most sought-after address \u2013 as a place to live for the wealthy, and somewhere to shop and be seen in the exclusive boutiques and cafes on the ground floor. Throughout its history, the palace served Budapest as a cultural hotspot, housing the famous Gresham-Venezia Caf\u00e9 and the P\u00f3dium Cabaret, known for its satirical and sometimes politically daring performances. However, the Soviets\u2019 siege of Budapest in 1944 left the building heavily damaged, and subsequent nationalization under communist rule in 1948 led to further decline. Influential artists \u201cGresham Palace and its coffee house were famous among artists and collectors,\u201d says Laszlovszky. \u201cThe so-called Gresham-circle was an informal, but very important, artistic meeting place before World War II. \u201cMembers of the circle, like R\u00f3bert Ber\u00e9ny, P\u00e1l P\u00e1tzay, B\u00e9ni Ferenczy, J\u00f3zsef Egry, Istv\u00e1n Sz\u0151nyi were painters or sculptors, the best artists of the period. Interestingly, they followed different artistic trends, but they were all influential people in the art life of the period.\u201d Despite suffering during wartime and enduring decades of neglect, the palace\u2019s spirit seemed to survive intact until 2001, when luxury hotel group Four Seasons embarked on an ambitious three-year project to restore the building\u2019s original splendor while integrating modern luxuries. A team of leading Hungarian architects, interior designers and craftsmen was assembled for the project. Architect Gabor Kruppa was responsible for the complete reconstruction of the palace, alongside restoration artist Mikl\u00f3s Szenkir\u00e1lyi. \u201cIt took thousands and thousands of hours for a unique team of highly trained masters from a variety of trades to cut this magnificent, Art Nouveau gem into a brilliant jewel,\u201d Szenkir\u00e1lyi said at the time. \u201cThe Gresham Palace has been born again in wonderful unity, serving as a crown jewel of outstanding beauty that complements our magnificent Chain Bridge.\u201d \u2018Extraordinary history\u2019 Since its reopening in 2004, the Four Seasons Hotel Gresham Palace has provided visitors with a well-appointed sanctuary, offering 179 rooms and suites with panoramic views of the Danube or the cityscape. Its interiors, from the grand lobby to the spa atop, exude a regal air. \u201cGresham Palace is one of Budapest\u2019s most iconic buildings, and today, through its mere existence, unique location, and architecture, it shapes the image that the city presents to any tourist wishing to explore it,\u201d Thibaut Drege, the hotel\u2019s general Manager, tells CNN Travel. \u201cThe fact that Four Seasons was able, 20 years ago, to renovate such a jewel reflects the extraordinary history that this building has undergone since its creation. Ultimately, it is this architecture that reflects an era when Budapest held a prominent position as a destination for high society Europeans. The city is now reclaiming this position, with growing interest notably from high-end travelers.\u201d As well as luxurious accommodation, guests and visitors of the hotel can also enjoy some of Budapest\u2019s top dining and relaxation spots. These include KOLL\u00c1ZS, a contemporary French brasserie which offers what\u2019s arguably the grandest setting in Budapest. The venue serves local Tokaji wines, artisan cocktails and a menu crafted by Executive Chef \u00c1rp\u00e1d Gy\u0151rffy, one of the finalists at the prestigious Bocuse d\u2019Or Hungary competition. The hotel\u2019s MU\u0301ZSA bar also offers artisan cocktails plus Asian food in a setting designed to transport visitors to Budapest\u2019s golden age. The venue also has a cultural program with ballet evenings and live performances. In a city renowned for its thermal baths, there\u2019s inevitably also a luxurious spa, offering steam rooms, a relaxation pool and a \u201cHungarian Moor Mud\u201d treatment, that\u2019s said to be popular with Hollywood A-listers.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/four-seasons-gresham-palace-budapest-hotel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_travel_star-wars-hotel-disney-jenny-nicholson-cec", "text": "In 2023, Disney closed a highly-publicized luxury hotel on the Walt Disney World property called \u201cStar Wars: Galactic Starcruiser.\u201d For Disney superfans, it was a time of high drama and schadenfreude as promises about the hotel\u2019s immersive world ran aground on the rocky reality of some guests\u2019 experiences. Now, a year later, a four-hour-long YouTube deep-dive has resurfaced details about the concept and spread the niche piece of Disney lore to millions of viewers. The creator of the video, YouTuber Jenny Nicholson, is known for her commentary on various corners of fan culture. Some of her most popular videos cover shows and movies like \u201cThe Vampire Diaries,\u201d \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d and installments in the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise. None of them are nearly as long as her most recent video, \u201cThe Spectacular Failure of the Star Wars Hotel.\u201d Over the course of 20 video chapters, Nicholson details her 2022 stay at the \u201cStar Wars: Galactic Starcruiser\u201d hotel in Orlando, Florida. The tale is likely familiar to Disney and Star Wars fans, many of whom heard about the high-dollar, high-concept hotel and its closure in 2023. Nicholson says she paid more than $6,000 for a two-night stay in the hotel, which was supposed to resemble a Star Wars-style spaceship called the Halcyon. The big draw of the hotel lay in what Disney marketing called an \u201cimmersive, customizable Star Wars experience\u201d that Nicholson equated to LARPing, or live-action roleplaying. Guests were encouraged to dress up, and through a combination of live experiences with cast members and choices made in a special app, were guided through a three-day-long Star Wars storyline complete with full itinerary and, if played to its full extent, very little downtime. With Disney-esque details like working lightsabers and colorful themed food, the experience was supposed to feel like a \u201clandlocked cruise,\u201d with all of the entertainment happening onboard the ship \u2014 in reality, a large ultra-secure windowless building near Walt Disney World\u2019s Epcot resort area. Nicholson\u2019s experience squared with some more critical reviews of the hotel: Cramped rooms, inconsistent experiences with technology and a general sense of confusion as to the purpose or audience of the venture. (She also mentioned, at length, some of the things she enjoyed, like cast member performances and details in the ship-hotel\u2019s interior.) Little of this is new information. Disney announced the closing of the Galactic Starcruiser in May 2023, and the hotel served its last guests last September. In a press release provided to CNN from that time, Disney said the project \u201cgave us the opportunity to try new things.\u201d \u201cStar Wars: Galactic Starcruiser is one of our most creative projects ever and has been praised by our guests and recognized for setting a new bar for innovation and immersive entertainment,\u201d the statement read. \u201c\u2026 we will take what we\u2019ve learned to create future experiences that can reach more of our guests and fans.\u201d Still, Nicholson\u2019s video netted more than 2 million views in two days, and has already wormed its way into the social media pipeline of memes and references. Some X users marveled at the fact that they willingly watched a double feature-length video about, as one user said, something they \u201cpreviously never gave a s*** about in my life.\u201d Why yesterday\u2019s drama draws today\u2019s audience Longform videos are an increasingly popular form of YouTube entertainment, and it isn\u2019t unusual to see older topics being reexamined in multi-hour \u201cdeep dives.\u201d Nicholson\u2019s video also combines several winning formulas into one: Disney, Star Wars, insider information (Nicholson includes pictures and videos from her time in the hotel) and, of course, failures. \u201cI couldn\u2019t care less about some dumb Star Wars hotel, but give me those 4 hours,\u201d one X user said. Consumer research from Google claims that longform videos are gaining traction among younger viewers and, interestingly, are even more successful when they cover \u201cfan culture\u201d content. \u201cThere is a healthy appetite for more in-depth exploration of topics such as film, TV, and sports,\u201d a 2022 Google consumer insights report reads. \u201cThese allow for fan-centric creators to share thoughts and ideas at length with an increasingly captive audience: 61% of Gen Z would describe themselves as a \u201creally big\u201d or \u201csuper fan\u201d of someone or something.\u201d Both Star Wars and Disney enjoy particularly loyal fandoms with elephant memories and no qualms about engaging the same topics over and over again. Even the tiniest details in a Star Wars movie or a Disney theme park have cult followings, backstories, fan lore and, of course, their own video deep dives. A spotlight on Disney\u2019s future Nicholson\u2019s video, while not exactly breaking news, drops as Disney prepares a new slate of innovations. Earlier this year, Disney announced a massive 10-year, $60 billion expansion program for its parks, cruises and experiences worldwide. That includes a planned 14-acre expansion at the Magic Kingdom in Orlando\u2019s Walt Disney World and an expansion of the original Disneyland in Anaheim. The company recently got final approval from Anaheim\u2019s city council to move forward with DisneylandForward, a nearly $2 billion investment in the Disneyland resort and surrounding areas. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to build on decades of innovation, creativity, and storytelling to bring new, exciting experiences for our guests,\u201d Disneyland Resort President Ken Potrock wrote in a blog post announcing the approval of the project. In April, Disney CEO Bob Iger said expansion plans for Walt Disney World are on track after the settlement of a long legal battle between Disney and the state of Florida. Iger said the decision \u201cwill actually enable us to pursue the kind of significant investment in our Florida parks.\u201d Disney enthusiasts are expecting a trove of new information this August, when the company hosts its annual D23 Expo that focuses on upcoming projects and attractions. While the Galactic Starcruiser hotel has now earned a place in the annals of Disney lore, renewed interest in its failure provides a new lens through which to see Disney Parks\u2019 ambitions and expansions. Will they live up to everyone\u2019s wildest dreams, or be the subject of the next four-hour YouTube deep dive?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/travel/star-wars-hotel-disney-jenny-nicholson-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_deer-deadly-vehicles-collision", "text": "Retired public relations professional Bonnie Sashin and her husband had just spent a nice Thanksgiving visit and meal with family at her stepson\u2019s suburban home in the Connecticut city of Fairfield, a charming burg of about 61,000 on Long Island Sound. By the time they departed the 2022 family gathering, the sun had already set, Sashin recalls. They cranked up her fairly new Subaru Forester SUV to head to a nearby hotel, where they were staying the night rather than make the two-and-a-half hour drive back to Brookline, Massachusetts, on full stomachs and in full darkness. \u201cAnd just as we turned the corner, practically out of the subdivision where my stepson lives \u2026\u00a0I can feel something hit the car. You know, it\u2019s dark, and I had no idea what could it be. And I was just very alarmed,\u201d Sashin said. \u201cMy husband thought it was some kind of animal, and we of course stopped and fortunately a nice, civic-minded woman in front of us stopped. \u2026 She got out of the car. She saw me. She was really nice. She said, \u2018Oh, that was a deer.\u2019 And she said, \u2018It happens all the time around here.\u2019\u201c The deadly deer problem It turns out that deer-vehicle collisions are far more than a southern Connecticut problem. They\u2019re a problem across much of the United States and in other nations. It also turns out Sashin was fortunate not to have been injured or even killed in the incident. Even people who realize how common deer-vehicle collisions are might be surprised at these startling stats for the United States from this November 2022 study in the journal Cell Biology: \u2022 Around 2.1 million deer-vehicle collisions occur annually. \u2022 The collisions cause more than $10 billion in economic losses annually. \u2022 Each year, they account for some 59,000 human injuries and 440 human deaths. Kip Adams, chief conservation officer with the National Deer Association, notes that deer are much more deadly to Americans each year than those scary movie and TV threats \u2013 sharks, alligators, bears and venomous snakes \u2013 combined. (For instance, there were just two deaths in the United States by shark attack in 2023.) Looks like we should be much more wary of Bambi than of Jaws. And the United States is not alone in having a deer problem. For instance, a 2023 study from Scotland\u2019s nature agency, NatureScot, estimated that 700 people are injured or killed in deer-vehicle collisions in the United Kingdom annually. They grapple with the deer problem in such far-flung places as British Columbia, Japan, Australia and Germany, too. So what can drivers do to protect themselves from unwanted encounters with these herbivores? When time is not on your side Adams says your best shield against a deer collision isn\u2019t a fancy gadget but knowledge. \u201cThe first step in helping to minimize hitting one is to be aware of when they are most active,\u201d he told CNN Travel in a phone interview. \u201cTwo things that play into that. \u2026 One is when they\u2019re most active daily and then also when they are most active annually.\u201d As for the daily factor, sunrise and sunset should be high-alert times for drivers, Adams said. Why is that? \u201cDeer are what\u2019s known as crepuscular \u2013 crepuscular means most active at dawn and dusk,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThe way their eyes are built, they can do the best job avoiding predators and collecting what they need when they move in low-light situations \u2013 that being dusk and that being dawn.\u201d But \u201cthat\u2019s not our peak vision time. So those two things together \u2013 more activity at a time when we can\u2019t see as good \u2013 really play into increased deer-vehicle collisions at those times,\u201d Adams said. Chad Stewart, a deer, elk and moose management specialist with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, concurs. \u201cI would say the hour on either side of both sunrise and sunset are the greatest times when a collision can occur,\u201d he said in an email interview with CNN Travel. \u201cThis is partly due to deer\u2019s activity around that time, but also because of heavy traffic patterns during those hours.\u201d But collisions can occur anytime around the clock, Adams cautions. Keep seasons in mind Collisions can also happen any time of year \u2013 after all, deer don\u2019t hibernate, Adams points out. But two times of year are typically more high risk. Adams said the first one is spring. That\u2019s fawning time, and \u201cdeer are way more active around roads,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen a doe is having her fawn, the does become extremely territorial of those areas. \u2026 What happens is deer get spread out a lot more on the landscape, which means that they\u2019re more apt to, you know, be near a road.\u201d But autumn is the season most fraught with danger, Adams said, \u201cand the majority of that occurs in November. During that time, deer greatly increase their daily movement patterns,\u201d he said, especially the bucks. Research from State Farm insurance company also highlights November as the most likely month of the year to have a collision with an animal. Where to be on high alert As Bonnie Sashin\u2019s collision in a Connecticut suburb illustrates, you don\u2019t have to be out in wilderness to collide with a deer. \u201cTypically, suburban areas can hold higher densities of deer, and with more miles driven by vehicles occurring in these areas compared to rural areas, total number of collisions tends to be highest in these areas,\u201d Stewart cautioned. \u201cBut with that being said, any place has the potential for a collision.\u00a0 Especially where habitat transitions occur (e.g. forest to field), which are commonly used locations for deer.\u201d Adams said be on extra guard where the woods come out close to the road, where \u201cwe have very little opportunity of seeing those deer prior to them being in front of a vehicle.\u201d The suburbs are also a big problem, he said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s extremely difficult to manage deer populations in those areas. We can\u2019t go in there in most cases and hunt like we do in more rural areas.\u201d States with the biggest deer problems Some US states have a bigger problem with deer-vehicle collisions than others. State Farm compiles annual statistics assessing the risk in each state. While the insurance company\u2019s statistics cover all animal-vehicle collisions, deer account for the majority of them. Seventeen states are considered \u201chigh risk\u201d for an animal-vehicle collision, according to the latest State Farm report for 2023-24. Topping the list is West Virginia, where drivers have a 1 in 38 annual risk of being in an animal-involved claim, State Farm says. That\u2019s not surprising to Adams. The Mountain State is filled with forests, has a high deer population and lacks much in the way of dense urban areas. \u201cThey have a lot of winding roads through wooded areas which further reduces the visibility. A lot of factors play together there that definitely put West Virginia at the top,\u201d Adams said. Rounding out the top 5 states are: No. 2: Montana (1 in 53 chance)No. 3: Pennsylvania (1 in 59 chance)No. 4: Michigan (1 in 60 chance)No. 5: Wisconsin (1 in 60 chance) Your best bets to avoid colliding with an animal: Nevada, where State Farm says the chance is just 1 in 770, and Hawaii (1 in 710 chance). Defensive driving Once you\u2019re better aware of when and where the collision risk is highest, then it\u2019s time to put driving strategies into place. \u201cBasic safe driving principles apply to reduce your chance at a collision.\u00a0 First and foremost, avoid distracted driving,\u201d Stewart said.\u00a0Also, slow down in areas known to have high deer numbers so you can \u201chave better reaction should one jump out in front of your vehicle.\u201d Adams said use your high beams whenever possible in deer territory \u2013 but don\u2019t blind oncoming traffic. Stewart\u2019s not sold on gadget remedies. \u201cUsing things like car mounted whistles are not proven to reduce or prevent collisions from occurring, so saving your money and not falling into a false sense of security with these items is advisable.\u201d However, do make good use of your car horn, advises the National Deer Association in this YouTube video. Some other tips from the Michigan State Police: \u2022 Deer typically follow one another in single file, so if you see one deer, there are likely more nearby.\u2022 Look for the reflection of headlights in a deer\u2019s eyes and deer silhouettes on the shoulder of the road.\u2022 Scan the roadside while driving, especially around wooded lots, fencerows, field edges and areas near water. Do. Not. Swerve. Unfortunately, some drivers despite all their caution are going to have to make a split-second decision \u2013 and fight a natural impulse \u2013 when there\u2019s a deer ahead in the road. \u201cWe have a campaign in Michigan called \u2018Don\u2019t veer for deer.\u2019 The reason this phrase is used is because while nobody wants to hit a deer, there can be far worse consequences by swerving to avoid a deer and hitting something else, like a telephone pole or another car,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cSometimes, collisions with deer simply can\u2019t be avoided. But the important thing is to not make it worse for you or somebody else by abruptly and erratically leaving your lane.\u201d Adams dispenses the same advice with a fatherly touch. \u201cI have a 17-year-old daughter. I talk to her about this all the time. Try to avoid the deer but do not swerve because your chances of having a bad accident are much higher,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s way better to hit a deer with the front of your car going straight where that car is built to withstand an impact than it is to swerve and go off the road\u201d and possibly hit a tree or another vehicle, Adams said. The problem with pets and feeding Collisions account for the vast majority of interactions that result in injuries or deaths to people, Adams said, but they aren\u2019t the only ways people can be hurt by these generally docile grazers. Though incidents are very rare, he said deer that have been raised in captivity and have lost their fear of humans can end up hurting the hands that fed them. \u201cYou can find accounts where \u2026 somebody got attacked by a deer, like literally attacked. In almost every case, that was a captive animal that had been hand reared.\u201d Several years ago, a Colorado woman was cited for illegally raising a young deer that attacked and gored one of her neighbors, according to state wildlife officials. In 2023, a Florida man\u2019s pet deer was euthanized on the scene by officials after the animal attacked one of his neighbors. Also in 2023, a man on vacation in Greece approached too closely to a deer for a selfie. The deer rammed him and broke some of his ribs. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission warns people not to feed deer and to treat them with the respect wild creatures deserve. Hunting accidents Hunting is the other time where human-deer interactions can go wrong. In 2019, an experienced Arkansas hunter was found severely injured in the woods, his body riddled with antler puncture wounds from a deer he had shot but had not killed. He later died. Experts say hunters should wait 15 to 30 minutes before approaching a shot deer to make sure it is dead. However, the biggest danger in deer hunting is other people, Adams said. \u201cHunting is very safe, and it has gotten way safer over the past couple of decades with hunter safety programs, but accidents still do happen. And it\u2019s very clear that the most dangerous person in the woods to you, if you\u2019re hunting, is the person you walked in the woods with.\u201d Again, awareness is key, Adams said. \u201cI have a family camp in northern Pennsylvania. We have a lot of friends and family that hunt that we share our land with. \u2026 If we are going out as a group to hunt deer, bear, whatever \u2026 I have a little safety talk and tell everybody, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s be careful today.\u2019 \u201c \u2018I came away lucky\u2019 Bonnie Sashin\u2019s Thanksgiving night collision with a deer happened in a flash. But the repercussions took a while to sort out. The Good Samaritan who stopped in front of her was quite helpful, she said. \u201cFirst thing she said to me \u2013 which was the best piece of advice for us because no one was hurt \u2013 was call the police \u2026 because you\u2019re gonna want a record for your insurance company.\u201d Sashin said she later learned about a friend who collided with a deer and didn\u2019t call the police right away \u2013\u00a0and the adjuster gave her a hard time. The front fender of Sashin\u2019s new car was bashed in, but she and her husband were able to drive her SUV back to Massachusetts, where they learned the vehicle could be repaired vs. being totaled. \u201cI went in to my body shop where I know the guy, his name is Paul. \u2026 He said, \u2018Bonnie, get in line. You know how many cars I have that have been hit by deer in the last week?\u2019 \u201d There were five or six ahead of hers, he told her. \u201cThe pain in the butt part is that you gotta wait a long time these days with a body shop. \u2026 It\u2019s very hard to get parts.\u201d She had to wait until February to get her SUV repaired. Sashin and her husband continue to drive to family trips in the Northeast, but they try to be off the road before dark these days. Despite everything, she\u2019s grateful they weren\u2019t hurt or the vehicle totaled. \u201cI came away lucky.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/deer-deadly-vehicles-collision/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_article_breakfast-tacos-origins-mexico-texas", "text": "Two simple words can spark mouth-watering bliss or a series of blistering retorts in Texans: Breakfast tacos. In the Lone Star State, who gets the credit for these morning tortilla sensations can be a matter of haba\u00f1ero-hot debate. A highly contested Eater article in 2016 helped start a full-on Breakfast Taco War between Austin and San Antonio. While that particular battle eventually settled down, flare-ups continue. But to get a true picture of this simple food with a complex history, we must go beyond Texas and first look at another place: Mexico. Mouthwatering tacos in Monterrey The breakfast taco is actually part of a long parade of foods (pizza, for instance) whose fuzzy origins and various claims of authenticity spark ferocious debate. There\u2019s one thing we know for darn sure: Today, breakfast tacos are enjoyed on both sides of the Rio Grande River. In her CNN \u201cSearching for Mexico\u201d series, actor Eva Longoria traveled to Monterrey in the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n.     There, she enjoyed a breakfast taco with Mexican food bloggers Gerardo Alvarado and Ernesto Esquivel at Tacos Do\u00f1a Mary La Gritona, which has been serving central Monterrey for nearly 20 years.  \u201cThe breakfast taco may be the simplest of street food, but it\u2019s been been hitting the spot for the workers of Monterrey for nearly a century,\u201d narrates Longoria. \u2018Not a junkie food\u2019   CNN Travel caught up with Esquivel \u2013 born and raised in the border state of Sonora and resident of Monterrey for more than 10 years \u2013 to find out more. \u201cWhen I arrived in Monterrey, I discovered all the different types of tacos that everyone eats in the morning. You can have a taco of eggs. You can have a taco of meat. You can have a taco of potatoes.\u201d Esquivel describes breakfast tacos as \u201ca really fast food, but not a junkie food.\u201d  Esquivel said you can find breakfast tacos in other states in northern Mexico, but Monterrey and the state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n are the culinary epicenter with more places to get them and a larger selection of fillings.  Some of the city\u2019s favorites are the machacado (dried beef) with eggs, the barbacoa (slow-cooked meat, often in a pit) and the deshebrada (shredded beef). In other words, you\u2019re in meat country. Timeline of the breakfast taco Esquivel said the breakfast taco goes back to the early 1900s and perhaps even earlier in Monterrey.  Compa\u00f1ia Fundidora, a former iron and steel foundry that dates to 1900 but is now a recreational and educational park, helped the breakfast taco get its start in Monterrey. Employees came \u201cto work really early, and so they had to have a really fast breakfast in the morning, and one fast breakfast in the morning is a breakfast taco.\u201d  And from there, the tacos spread into southern Texas, Esquivel said, which is reflected in the cuisine of today. \u201cI think the flavors here in Monterrey, mostly in the north, are similar to some flavors in Texas.\u201d Along with Do\u00f1a Mary\u2019s, he suggests these spots for a breakfast taco if you\u2019re in Monterrey: Tacos Rafa Ahogados, Tacos Piedra and Tony\u2019s Tacos. North of the Rio Grande   The river may mark a political line between two nations, but it has been no barrier at all to crossings of cuisine and culture. And Texas also shares a passion for the breakfast taco. You can tell that just from all the kerfuffles about them. \u201cNo Texas city can claim the breakfast taco,\u201d says Jos\u00e9 Ralat, the taco editor of Texas Monthly magazine. He places the ultimate credit south of the Rio Grande. \u201cIt comes from Mexico \u2013 where exactly, it\u2019s not really known. Geographically, the most likely source is northern Mexico. There is no literature that I have seen that can point to any particular city in northern Mexico.\u201d As for today, \u201cthey\u2019re popular in [the Mexican states of] Tamaulipas, Nuevo Le\u00f3n and Coahuila, which all border Texas,\u201d he said. Eddie Vega \u2013 who grew up in McAllen, across from the Mexican city of Reynosa in Tamaulipas state \u2013 is known as \u201cTaco Poet of Texas.\u201d He points out that historically, what\u2019s now south Texas was once part of Mexico.  Before 1836, \u201cthe border was further north. All this region was eating a combination of indigenous and Spanish food together.\u201d Vega said that growing up, breakfast tacos weren\u2019t some trendy food to him attracting attention from the likes of The New York Times and other coastal media. \u201cWhen you get to south Texas, and I\u2019m from the Valley, we had breakfast tacos, but they were in my house. My mom would make them. It\u2019s not something we\u2019d go to a restaurant to get because economically that region is very poor and nobody\u2019s eating out. Or not eating out in the morning especially.\u201d Enter Austin Ralat and Vega both said the breakfast taco was staple deep in south Texas and then San Antonio long before Austin got in on the action. So how did Austin become so synonymous with them? Austin has \u201ca great branding mentality, they have a knack for PR. Every year, Austin is flooded with coastal elites checking out South by Southwest,\u201d Ralat said. \u201cThey try some options, and then in their minds, they think it\u2019s an Austin thing. My job is to question the stuff \u2026 and let history speak for itself.\u201d  Ralat said San Antonio has \u201ca bit of an inferiority complex that they\u2019re often overlooked to the benefit of Austin when San Antonio is older, has more culture, it\u2019s more diverse, and the food is better.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, they\u2019re both Tex Mex towns, and breakfast tacos are Tex Mex. But they\u2019re also border food. When the Eater article came out\u201d \u2013 championing Austin as \u201chome\u201d of the breakfast taco \u2013 \u201cSan Antonians lost their minds.\u201d   Vega said the culinary history is too distant for any one place to stamp itself as originator or king purveyor. \u201cI don\u2019t know that one city \u2013 San Antonio, Corpus Christi, McAllen, Brownsville or Laredo \u2013 can claim it. You have differences with them because of ingredients.\u201d Movin\u2019 on Jessica Elizarraras, a Rio Grande Valley native and the executive producer for MySA.com, said many people have put the origins dispute behind them. \u201cI think at this point we\u2019ve mostly moved on from the great taco war of 2016,\u201d Elizarraras said in an email interview with CNN Travel. \u201cIs there occasional ribbing? Absolutely! Are there great tacos across the state? 1000 percent. The Mexican diaspora is far-reaching and so are their tacos.\u201d She cites a 2016 article by Gustavo Arellano as a detailed settlement of the issue that effectively shows Austin is not the start of the breakfast taco.  She also points out the regional differences within Texas. \u201cA flour tortilla in San Antonio tends to lean a bit puffier than its Rio Grande Valley/Coast counterparts. Con Huevos Tacos in San Antonio is the best of both worlds: a thin but sturdy tortilla, filled with fun, flavorful combinations.\u201d They\u2019ve gone nationwide   Ralat said he\u2019s now seeing breakfast tacos coast to coast. He was also recently in Nashville and saw them offered there.  \u201cI hesitate to eat them at a place that calls them Austin-style. \u2026 I want the food to be high quality. I don\u2019t want it to be spin.\u201d  Elizarraras suggests people just enjoy them \u2013 with or without huevos (eggs).  \u201cBreakfast tacos are ephemeral as they come, which makes them that much more magical,\u201d she said. \u201cBean and cheese is a great example of a breakfast taco that doesn\u2019t have eggs. \u2026 Chicharron en salsa (verde or rojo) is another example of a tasty taco that doesn\u2019t require eggs. Barbacoa \u2013 made using a whole cow-head, and more generally, beef cheeks \u2013 is a classic breakfast taco in San Antonio, often paired with Big Red [soda] for a Sunday morning treat.\u201d  The joy of it all In the end, why does the origin of a type of food even matter? \u201cPart of the issue is erasure. Just like with anything else in our Mexican-American culture, to feel left out of a conversation when you know you\u2019ve part of that conversation for a long time.\u201d Vega said. And back south of the Rio Grande, they are a source of unity, Esquivel said.  \u201cI think the breakfast tacos here in Monterrey \u2026 and the northeast of the country is something that unites everyone.\u201d  They\u2019re popular with the poor, the middle class and the rich, he said. \u201cThe place can be ugly. The place can be like in the streets. But you will see people in suits there eating breakfast tacos.\u201d  For Ralat, breakfast tacos are much more than a great way to start the morning. \u201cI think history, especially food history, is important to know because it provides another mirror for our culture. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to me that tortillas are the foundation of Mexican culture, and to break bread with someone is a sacred act. So let\u2019s take it literally, and say that you share tacos with someone else. That\u2019s so nice. And it\u2019s just so joyful.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/article/breakfast-tacos-origins-mexico-texas/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}

{"id": "travel_article_how-to-survive-alligator-attack", "text": "Jeffrey Heim woke up on May 30, 2021, with one thing on his mind: Sharks.  Specifically, shark teeth. They\u2019re his passion and his business. An unsuccessful attempt the day before to find any of them only fueled his obsession to find some on his next outing, he told CNN Travel recently. So on a hot, sunny Sunday in Sarasota County, Florida, the 25-year-old Heim proceeded to the Myakka River on a spot about 45 minutes from the Gulf of Mexico. He had been there numerous times and was comfortable with plunging into its murky waters to find the teeth of extinct megalodons in the riverbed. He put on his wetsuit, mask, fins and snorkel and entered the water from the shore, not far from a restaurant along the riverbank.  Heim slipped beneath the surface. He was under no more than one minute when he felt something. Something bad. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything, didn\u2019t see anything. I just felt like a blunt force object \u2013 like someone \u2026 swinging a baseball bat and just whacking my head. But mostly what I felt was what I thought was a huge boat just slamming into me and just pulling me down.\u201d To his shock, it wasn\u2019t a boat.  He was in the water, alone and face-to-face with an alligator.  Gator attacks: Rare but fascinating   Heim was in a situation many people probably fear but very few actually experience: an attack by an alligator. An estimated 5 million wild American alligators are spread out across 10 states in Southeast and beyond, including parts of North Carolina and even the extreme southeastern tip of Oklahoma. Louisiana has an estimated 2 million wild gators in a state of about 4.65 million people. Florida sports roughly 1.25 million alligators (and more than 1,000 American crocodiles). Georgia has about a quarter of a million. Some of these gators inhabit places where lots of people live and many others vacation, such as lakes and rivers all across Florida and coastal South Carolina. Yet gator attacks aren\u2019t that frequent and deaths even more infrequent (deadly attacks from dogs and horses and other mammals are more common). There were 442 unprovoked bite incidents in Florida from 1948 to 2021, and 26 of these bites resulted in people dying, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conversation Commission. It turns out gators, in natural conditions, simply aren\u2019t that interested in people, according to Kimberly Andrews, a gator and snake expert with a doctorate in ecology from University of Georgia\u2019s Marine Extension and Georgia Sea Grant and who manages its Coastal Ecology Lab.  \u201cWe are not their prey. If you think about it, we\u2019re quite dangerous to attack. We\u2019ve got arms and legs. We can stand upright. We can walk, we can swim. \u2026 We\u2019re not a good animal to pick a fight with.\u201d \u201cUnless they\u2019re confronted, they\u2019re going to stay on their own turf.\u201d Nonetheless, people continue to be fascinated by such possible encounters. Overblown reputation     Andrews wants to dispel the notion of gators as aggressive, ravenous menaces on the move. \u201cThey\u2019re called ambush predators. We also call these \u2018sit-and-wait\u2019 predators,\u201d she said.  They\u2019re large, so it\u2019s \u201cenergetically costly for them to be really active. \u2026 We would be considered an active forager. We go out and find our food.\u201d Not so with gators. \u201cWhen you come down to it, they\u2019re not that maneuverable. Large body. Small legs. And this also plays into why the perception of their danger is exaggerated from the actuality.\u201d  Nonetheless, caution is advised when you\u2019re in gator territory, be that at golf courses, swamps, lakes, rivers and hiking and bike trails and fishing spots along waterways. Best defense: Avoid an attack  Education is key to avoiding a bad encounter, Andrews said. Start with knowing when gators are most active. Courtship season starts as spring warms up; mating extends in early summer; and in Okefenokee Swamp in southeastern Georgia, \u201cwe start to see eggs hatch out starting in September and October. \u2026 And that\u2019s when the females are most protective when they feel someone is threatening their babies,\u201d Andrews said. Your best season is winter: If it\u2019s cold, \u201cthey\u2019re not doing whole lot.\u201d When temperatures start settling into the 80s (27 Celsius), gators become mostly nocturnal. So it\u2019s best to avoid that refreshing night dip in unknown waters when it\u2019s hot. Don\u2019t provoke, don\u2019t feed, don\u2019t panic   Unprovoked attacks are rare, Andrews said. People are usually the provocateurs, not the gators. Gators can be disturbed or confused when folks have been known to try to grab them by their tails or go in for close-up photos of sunning gators Even worse, people will feed them. Then the reptiles start to associate humans with food. That\u2019s when gators can be most dangerous \u2013 when they\u2019ve lost their natural fear or disinterest in people. \u201cThey\u2019re more likely to take the easy way out and get our food than to do the work to fight for it,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cIn areas where we have high rates of tourism but not a lot of education and oversight of how people are interacting with alligators, we see feeding issues.\u201d  If you do have a gator encounter, she suggests staying calm and respecting its territory  \u201cSay you\u2019re kayaking, and you see an alligator, just keep going past it. Give it a wide berth, as much as the space will allow,\u201d Andrews said.  \u201cDon\u2019t take the paddles and slap the water. Sometimes people do that to scare the alligator off,\u201d but you\u2019re actually indicating you\u2019re a direct threat.  \u201cIf for some reason they start to swim toward you \u2026 usually try to go in the other direction and just show you\u2019re not interested. Or paddle right on by and ignore the animal.\u201d Also, never mess with the reptiles\u2019 children. \u201cWe always tell people that those one-foot baby alligators, even though they\u2019re so cute, they\u2019re the most dangerous sized alligator to mess with.\u201d That\u2019s because there\u2019s possibly a nearby mother ready to protect her young. More ways to avoid an attack   Authoritative websites have plenty of good advice to avoid a dangerous encounter. From the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory at the University of Georgia: \u2022 Don\u2019t feed ducks, turtles or other animals that share waters with alligators.  \u2022 Stay about 60 feet (18 meters) or more away from an adult alligator. If an alligator hisses or lunges at you, you are too close. \u2022 If you\u2019re driving, let an alligator cross the road. They move across roadways the most often in spring and summer.  \u2022 Supervise pets and children when you\u2019re in gator territory. \u201cLarge alligators do not recognize the difference between domestic pets and wild food sources,\u201d the SREL says. \u2022 Avoid heavy vegetation in and near the water\u2019s edge.  The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission also advises: \u2022 Never swim outside of posted areas, and swim only during daylight hours. Alligators are most active between dusk and dawn. \u2022 Get rid of fish scraps in garbage cans at boat ramps and fish camps; don\u2019t toss them in the water. Experts also advise people to call local or state authorities if you see alligators roaming around neighbors and other places you wouldn\u2019t expect. Do not try to handle the reptiles yourself. As for Jeffrey Heim, these tips were more than theory. Mission: Survival   Heim was in serious trouble, and he knew it. The gator had already bit him in the skull and on the hand. And it was coming toward him again. The gator \u201cpulled my mask off and pulled my head down towards my stomach. And then I come up, head above water. I no longer have the mask with the GoPro that\u2019s filming. And we\u2019re both looking at each other, and we both sit there for about two or three seconds, and I feel my head.\u201d  He wasn\u2019t sure what he was feeling at the time, but he learned later it was his scalp, partially torn off his skull and flapping in the water. Then \u201cshe lunges at me and I back away calmly \u2026  like I would with my experience with sharks, you don\u2019t want to act like prey. So I just backed away to keep my space.\u201d \u201cAnd then she really aggressively lunged at me \u2026\u201d  What to do if you\u2019re attacked   Heaven forbid you\u2019re that person like Heim who is being attacked by an alligator. Would you know what to do? If the gator is trying to drag you under the water, \u201cyou have to assume at this point you\u2019re fighting for your life, and you\u2019ve got to give it all you\u2019ve got,\u201d Andrews said.  \u201cWe recommend trying to poke them in the eye, hitting them in the top part of the skull or the side of the jaw. Those points are sensitive on alligators just like they are on us,\u201d she said. In a water attack, the danger is more from drowning than the bite, Andrews said. So get to land if possible. \u201cWe\u2019re better on land than they are. They\u2019re better in the water.\u201d But don\u2019t assume all is safe if you\u2019re on land. And the alligator has more in its arsenal that a fearsome set of teeth.  You can be injured if you\u2019re hit by the tail. Gators can also whip around with their skull and use it like a battering ram. Andrews knows first-hand how dangerous that can be.   She was part of a capture team once that had a gator taped up and its mouth secured when it unexpectedly whipped its head around.  \u201cIt actually hit me broad with the side of its head across my shins \u2026 and I blacked out. And I wondered, \u2018Oh my gosh, did I fracture my shin bone?\u2019 I had a lump the size of a tennis ball. It is amazing how muscular and powerful they are,\u201d Andrews recalled. The gator uses its mouth. Use yours. \u201cScream, make as much noise [as you can], not only fight back but make yourself as big and as much a pain in the rear end as you possibly can.\u201d If people are nearby, they should call 911 for help, Andrews said. If a pole is nearby, someone can beat on the gator and give it another target.  \u201cAnother person in an attempt to rescue you should never come in the water after you and the alligator. They can help you most by being on the ground and helping you get to the ground,\u201d Andrews said.  Other ways to fend off an attack   Here are some more survival tips from various wildlife departments and other experts: \u2022 If you can escape on land, run away in a straight line. Experts debunk the advice to zig-zag. Gators can move really fast on land, but only in short bursts and distances before they tire out. \u2022 Try to cause a gag reflex by jamming any objects you can reach into the back of the alligator\u2019s mouth. \u2022 Sometimes a gator will reposition its prey in its mouth. With its jaw back open, that is your chance to escape. \u2022 \u201cAlligators clamp down with powerful jaws, then twist and roll. If an alligator bites your arm, it may help to grab the alligator and roll with it to reduce tearing of the arm,\u201d according to advice from the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources. \u2022 Get immediate medical attention if bitten. Alligator bites often result in serious infection.   All of this is specific to American alligators, Andrews emphasizes.  Other crocodilian species in places such as Africa and Australia can be more aggressive. We\u2019re actually prey-sized for some of these, she said.  But the relatively few crocodiles in southern Florida aren\u2019t known for attacking people. The escape   One of Andrews\u2019 survival tips came in very hand handy as the female gator lunged yet again at Heim. \u201cI really backed away. Got out of that river as quickly as I could. I climbed out of the six-foot bank and stumbled over to the parking lot.\u201d He was about to pass out, but he was able \u201cto yell over to some people over at that restaurant.\u201d Fortunately, they heard his cries for help and were able to assist him with a first aid kit from the restaurant and call 911. While waiting for the paramedics, he wasn\u2019t in pain. But \u201cthe whole time I\u2019m sitting down just super loopy and exhausted. That\u2019s when I thought I was going to die.\u201d He ended up in the ICU in a hospital for two days but was back at work the next week \u201cwith staples in my head.\u201d  Lessons learned   Heim has now had time to reflect on what he did that day and on what others can learn from his attack. \u201cI knew there were gators there. This day, I basically did everything wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cI was aware it was gator mating season, but I went to the river with too much confidence, especially being alone, and free diving, which I had never done in that river before.\u201d \u201cThat cockiness, or confidence, led to the bite, honestly, even though this was an uncharacteristically aggressive alligator apparently. It was still the wrong time of year to go.\u201d  Like other young people who have spent time in the watery wilds in the Southeast, he was lulled into a false sense of security because he had been around gators before with no ill results. \u201cI was casually looking around for gators, but if I had even seen one, I had dove with them before and it hadn\u2019t caused an issue.\u201d \u201cI think the difference was this was near a restaurant, and fed gators are the most aggressive gators. So that\u2019s what the gator professionals believe contributed to this attack, too,\u201d Heim said.   \u201cIf you\u2019re going to dive in a river like that, which I don\u2019t suggest anymore, don\u2019t free dive. You\u2019re going to go up and down like their prey. And you\u2019re going to look much smaller that you actually are.\u201d \u201cWeigh all risks. Anything can happen at anytime to anyone. None of us are invincible. And I think it was the youth in me being a little too confident.\u201d  Heim has been chastened, but not chased off. He continues to search for shark teeth and has ramped up operations for his business, SHRKco. His approach is different now. He\u2019s more cautious. He said he has more and better equipment. He\u2019s even been diving back in the Myakka twice since the attack. However, he now goes with other people, including gator experts.  Andrews said it\u2019s crucial for people to co-exist with alligators because they\u2019re an Indispensable part of the ecology as an apex predator keeping populations of other animals in check. \u201cIn the South, they\u2019re part of our heritage. What a charismatic and iconic feature of our landscapes. It should be: We like our sweet tea. We like our grits. We like our alligators. This is part of who we are.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/article/how-to-survive-alligator-attack/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}

Taquer\u00eda El Califa de Le\u00f3n, located in the San Rafael neighborhood of Mexico City, was among the establishments to garner either one or two stars in the first ever Michelin Guide Mexico, published earlier this week, making it the first Mexican taco stand to receive the honor. Chef Arturo Rivera Mart\u00ednez, who has been serving customers at Taquer\u00eda El Califa de Le\u00f3n for at least two decades, was presented with the famous white chef\u2019s jacket while dishing out his popular tacos on Wednesday. \u201cThe secret is the simplicity of our taco,\u201d Rivera Mart\u00ednez told the Associated Press. \u201cIt has only a tortilla, red or green sauce, and that\u2019s it. That, and the quality of the meat.\u201d Taquer\u00eda El Califa de Le\u00f3n, which is only about 10 feet wide, has been around for more than 50 years and is known for its Gaonera taco, apparently named in honor of Mexican bullfighter Rodolfo Gaona. \u201cThis taqueria may be bare bones with just enough room for a handful of diners to stand at the counter but its creation, the Gaonera taco, is exceptional,\u201d reads a statement on the Michelin Guide website. \u201cThinly sliced beef filet is expertly cooked to order, seasoned with only salt and a squeeze of lime. \u201cAt the same time, a second cook prepares the excellent corn tortillas alongside.

{"id": "travel_ethiopian-unique-calendar-year", "text": "On September 11, Ethiopians will celebrate the end of one year and the beginning of another. However, when the East African country rings in its New Year in a few months, it will technically be 2017, according to the Ethiopian calendar. So why is Ethiopia, Africa\u2019s second most populous country, seven years and eight months \u201cbehind\u201d much of the rest of the world? And how does that work for Ethiopians living on an increasingly interconnected planet that mostly operates in an entirely different era? The answers lie in traditions that date back centuries \u2013 and a firm sense of national identity. Unique calendar In Ethiopia, the birth year of Jesus Christ is recognized as seven or eight years later than the Gregorian, or \u201cWestern\u201d calendar, which was introduced by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582. According to experts, the Roman Church adjusted its calculation in 500 CE, while the Ethiopian Orthodox Church opted to stick to the ancient dates. Although much of the rest of the world went on to adopt the Gregorian calendar, Ethiopia has kept its own. \u201cWe are unique,\u201d says Eshetu Getachew, CEO of Rotate Ethiopia Tours And Travel. \u201cWe [were] never colonized. We have our own calendar. We have our own alphabet. We have our own cultural traditions.\u201d Thought to date back at least 1,500 years, the Ethiopian Calendar has many similarities to the Coptic calendar of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, an Oriental Orthodox Christian church based in Egypt. Following a solar-lunar system, it\u2019s 13 months long, with 12 of those months lasting for 30 days. The final month consists of just five days, or six days during a leap year. Travelers visiting Ethiopia are often stunned to learn that they\u2019ve gone \u201cback in time,\u201d with some taking to social media to express their bewilderment. As international businesses and schools based in the country tend to follow the Gregorian\u00a0calendar, many Ethiopians have little choice but to use both the traditional Ethiopian calendar and the Western calendar simultaneously. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult,\u201d Ethiopian archaeologist Goitom W. Tekle, currently based in Germany, tells CNN Travel. \u201cI still can\u2019t switch into one\u2026 It\u2019s quite a challenge. \u201cI need to think of the hours, the days. Sometimes the months, and sometimes even the year.\u201d Tekle explains that some institutions have to keep switching between the two calendars, incorporating the different dates and times, when corresponding with Ethiopians, especially those based in rural areas, and those outside the country. Even something as simple as applying for a birth certificate can pose problems when attempting to merge the Ethiopian system and the Western system. Date confusion \u201cLet\u2019s say, a baby is three years old, and you file for their birth certificate with the city or with the local government,\u201d says German historian Verena Krebs, who specializes in medieval European and African history. \u201cAnd then you state according to the Ethiopian system of time, and then you have to trust that the clerk does the conversion well. \u201cSo there are certain variables, which can then result in doubled or tripled birthdays.\u201d While she notes that this may seem unusual to those who aren\u2019t accustomed to it, it\u2019s not something that she gives much thought to anymore. \u201cYou just adapt to the system,\u201d she says. \u201cYou switch from one to the other. So you\u2019re not even actively aware anymore that this is a thing that people might find striking, because it\u2019s become so normal.\u201d Krebs also acknowledges that the traditional Ethiopian calendar isn\u2019t the only separate calendar, pointing to the ancient Egyptian calendar, where the year 2024 corresponds to the year 6266, as an example. \u201cThat is clearly a very, very different way of counting time,\u201d she says. Saudi Arabia has traditionally prioritized the Hijri calendar, made up of 12 months and 354 days, but recently approved the use of the Gregorian calendar for official dealings. Meanwhile, the Hebrew calendar is the official calendar of Israel. Krebs feels that interest in the Ethiopian calendar has increased in recent years, suggesting that this may be linked to the fact that it\u2019s \u201cvery close\u201d to the Gregorian calendar, and yet different. \u2018Logical\u2019 approach Photographer Abel Gashaw is among the many Ethiopians who have adapted to moving between both calendars relatively comfortably. However, he admits that he prefers the Ethiopian calendar, describing it as \u201cmore logical,\u201d particularly in reference to the start of the year. New Year, or Enkutatash, which translates to \u201cgift of jewels\u201d in the Ethiopian Semitic language Amharic, arrives towards the end of the rainy season. Adey Abeba, a flower indigenous to Ethiopia, blooms during this period and has become a symbol of the Ethiopian New Year. \u201cThat\u2019s like a fresh start,\u201d says Gashaw. \u201cIt\u2019s a new beginning for us\u2026 After that, the amount of rain becomes low, and everywhere you go, it\u2019s so green.\u201d He goes on to point out that having the New Year on January 1 wouldn\u2019t make any sense in Ethiopia, as the date falls during the dry season, whereas September 11 (or September 12 during a leap year,) which also marks the beginning of the Egyptian year, works well. \u201cI know it\u2019s a bad day for the world,\u201d says Gashaw, referencing the 9/11 attacks in 2001. \u201cBut the Ethiopian calendar happens annually on that day.\u201d Meanwhile, Krebs stresses that \u201cthere\u2019s no reason beyond basically the Christian appropriation of pagan holidays from the Roman Empire\u201d to suggest that the New Year should begin \u201cat the threshold between December and January.\u201d \u201cSo I think it makes much more sense, in that it often coincides with the tail end of the rainy season. It\u2019s not over yet, but it\u2019s going out,\u201d she adds. It\u2019s not just months, days and years that differ in Ethiopia. The country also runs on its own time system. 12-hour clock While most countries begin their day at midnight, Ethiopians use a 12-hour clock system that runs from dawn to dusk, beginning at 1 a.m. This means that what most people outside of the country would consider as 7 a.m., Ethiopians would class as 1 a.m. Gashaw explains that this is reflective of life in Ethiopia \u2013 the hours of daylight in the country are pretty consistent due to its proximity to the Equator \u2013 and feels like a more sensible approach. \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t know why the European time changes at midnight,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause everybody sleeps.\u201d Understandably, this can cause confusion, particularly for travelers visiting the country. When making appointments with international visitors, Gashaw always makes sure to clarify whether they\u2019re referring to Ethiopian timings or Western time. \u201cIf somebody says let\u2019s meet at 2 p.m. I will double-check [whether they mean morning or afternoon.]\u201d he says. \u201cAlso, when I buy a flight ticket, the airlines use the European calendar, so I double check three or four times, to understand in my time.\u201d However, even he\u2019s gotten it wrong on occasion. Gashaw once missed an exam because his university schedule was set to Western times, and he misunderstood. \u201cWhen they said 2 p.m., I thought it was in Ethiopian time, and that means in the morning,\u201d he explains. \u201cSo when I go there\u2019s nobody there. I think. \u2018Okay, the exam got canceled.\u2019\u201d Tekle suggests that there may be something of a disconnect between residents who live in more rural areas of the country and don\u2019t necessarily have to consider different timings and calendars, and those based in the cities who are regularly exposed to the Western system. Time of change? \u201cEthiopia is a very conservative Christian country where the majority of the people don\u2019t care about the rest of the world,\u201d he says, explaining that the way things are done in the Western world would be of little interest or concern to many Ethiopians, particularly those who live in the countryside. \u201cThey tell you a time\u2026 Sometimes they don\u2019t even know that there is another way of counting time.\u201d Of course, Ethiopia has made it all the way to 2024 \u2013 or 2016 depending on which system you\u2019re using \u2013 without shifting its approach to timing, changing its calendar or amending its method of counting the years. But is that likely to change in the future as more people based in rural areas of the country become connected to the rest of the world? \u201cI know that a lot of farmers nowadays already, of course, have smartphones,\u201d says Krebs, noting that this could potentially affect the way they view the Ethiopian approach to things. \u201cIt will be interesting [to see] how that plays out in the coming decades with even more connectivity and whether that will have an impact.\u201d Gashaw doesn\u2019t feel that this is a particularly pressing issue, or something that will make much of a difference to Ethiopians either way. \u201cIn my opinion, as long as there\u2019s complete months and days difference, the year coordination will not matter that much,\u201d he says. Tekle stresses that the traditional Ethiopian calendar, based on the teachings of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, isn\u2019t even the only functioning calendar in the country. It\u2019s also worth noting that Ethiopia has the third-largest Muslim population in sub-Saharan Africa. \u201cThere are at least two other calendars, to my knowledge, that work for people who use them in southern Ethiopia,\u201d he explains. \u201cSo you know, you can use a lot of other calendars.\u201d For Krebs, the notion that a country with a population of around 130 million should alter one of its long-standing traditions in the name of \u201cpracticality\u201d is difficult to champion. \u201cThere is no real reason, other than practicality, that anybody should adapt to it [the Western method of tracking time] in a globalized world,\u201d she says. \u201cFrom an outsider\u2019s perspective, I don\u2019t think that any other nation should lose their own local system, which has much more cultural significance and meaning [to them].\u201d Correction: A previous version of this story misidentified Ethiopia\u2019s location in Africa.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/ethiopian-unique-calendar-year/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_vacation-fling-love-story-chance-encounters", "text": "Guillermo Barrantes relationship with Larry Mock was supposed to begin and end in Palm Springs. It was a \u201ccasual, brief encounter.\u201d A vacation dalliance that only lasted half a day. \u201cIt was just so casual, so easily nothing could have happened from it,\u201d Guillermo tells CNN Travel. \u201cWe could have walked away and just had our lives separate. But of course that didn\u2019t happen, because it wasn\u2019t meant to be that way. It was meant to be the way that it was. That it is.\u201d It all started in summer 2013. Guillermo - then in his early 40s - was on vacation in the California resort city of Palm Springs. He was in a phase of life where, he says, he was prioritizing himself, and wasn\u2019t interested in long term romance. \u201cI thrived in being by myself, in traveling by myself, in having dinner by myself \u2013 I loved all of that so much,\u201d says Guillermo, who lived in Boston, Massachusetts at the time. \u201cI wanted no commitment, I wanted no emotional entanglement of any kind. I wanted to have fun, get to know myself. And it was in that mode that I met Larry, when I wasn\u2019t really looking.\u201d During the vacation in Palm Springs, Guillermo was staying at a friend\u2019s apartment, and while the friend worked during the day, Guillermo passed his time at a \u201crun-down, no-frills\u201d resort a couple of blocks away. \u201cYou could just pay for a day pass, they\u2019d give you a towel, and you could be in the pool and use their bar,\u201d he recalls. One day, as he was walking the palm tree-lined streets to the resort, Guillermo swiped right on a guy on a dating app \u2013 Larry Mock, mid-40s, friendly smile. The two men exchanged a few messages back and forth. Larry said he was also on vacation in Palm Springs, staying in the resort Guillermo kept frequenting. They arranged to meet there for a drink by the pool. Guillermo was looking forward to meeting Larry, expecting \u201csome casual fun.\u201d Then, when Guillermo and Larry met, there was \u201cchemistry\u201d right away. Guillermo calls their connection \u201cmagnetic.\u201d \u201cMy impression of Larry: sexy, handsome and warm,\u201d he recalls. Larry was a Texas-based American Airlines flight attendant who\u2019d booked the vacation to Palm Springs at the last minute. He\u2019d recently broken up with a long-term partner but due to lease and budget reasons the two were still living together \u2013 awkwardly \u2013 in Dallas, Texas. Larry\u2019s workdays were spent traveling the world. But during his downtime, he struggled to relax in the apartment with his ex, and this sentiment motivated the spontaneous vacation. \u201cI needed to get out of town for the weekend, because we were just butting heads badly at that time,\u201d Larry tells CNN Travel today. Larry searched his airline\u2019s database, looking at destinations he could visit using the last minute, standby flight tickets available for flight attendants. \u201cPalm Springs had seats, so I booked my standby flight, got to Palm Springs, checked into this resort. And that\u2019s where Guillermo came into the picture,\u201d says Larry. Larry was instantly attracted to Guillermo. He thought he was \u201cjust the most handsome guy\u201d he\u2019d ever seen. And as they got chatting, and Guillermo kept making Larry laugh, Larry sketched out his first impression to include two more adjectives: \u201cso funny, and so kind.\u201d In passing, as the two flirted over pool-side cocktails, Larry mentioned that he was a flight attendant. Guillermo lit up. In fact, his response was \u201cgiddy,\u201d as Larry recalls it. \u201cHe started asking me tons of questions about planes, and flight attendants, and the routes and all of that kind of stuff.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a huge aviation geek,\u201d explains Guillermo. As a kid growing up in Costa Rica, he\u2019d wanted to be a pilot. Instead, he ended up working as an IT consultant. And while he says he was good at that job, liked it well enough and made good money \u2013 he still dreamed about working in aviation. Meeting a flight attendant was fascinating. \u201cI was immediately drawn to his career,\u201d says Guillermo. Larry found Guillermo\u2019s enthusiasm for aviation charming, and happily answered his questions. Later that evening, Larry and Guillermo said their goodbyes, with no plans to meet again. \u201cI was glad to meet him,\u201d says Larry. \u201cBut I was like, \u2018There\u2019s no way I am going to pursue dating somebody that lived in Boston.\u2019 And I still was dealing with what I was dealing with in Dallas.\u201d \u201cWe just really enjoyed the time that we had together,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cBut we went our separate ways.\u201d Unexpected moments Almost without realizing \u2013 and certainly without intending to \u2013 Guillermo and Larry stayed in touch. \u201cWe kept chatting, we kept texting,\u201d says Guillermo. Then, a few days after meeting Larry, Guillermo got an unexpected phone call from his mother in Costa Rica. He was still in Palm Springs at the time. \u201cShe said, \u2018I don\u2019t want you to freak out, but I just got diagnosed with breast cancer. I don\u2019t want you to change the trip.\u2019\u201d Guillermo tried to protest, but his mother insisted he should enjoy the rest of his vacation. She reassured him that her sisters and Guillermo\u2019s father were taking care of her, and she\u2019d see Guillermo later in the month \u2013 he already had a trip to Costa Rica scheduled for that summer. Not wanting to go against his mother\u2019s wishes, Guillermo stayed put in the desert. He tried to \u201ccompartmentalize\u201d the news, but he was really close to his mom, and it was cataclysmic. Later, back home in Boston, Guillermo found himself sharing his mother\u2019s news with Larry, and confiding in him about his fears and worries. He added that his mother lived in Costa Rica, so he\u2019d likely be flying back and forth for the rest of the year. Larry was supportive, empathetic \u2013 and he told Guillermo that he should use the discounted flights Larry got through work. Guillermo was taken aback \u2013 it was \u201csuch a sweet gesture\u201d from someone who was basically a stranger. But then, somehow, Larry already felt much more than that. \u201cVery early on, he and I had just beautiful interactions, and it revealed the kind of person that he was,\u201d he says. And so, rather than dwindling, Larry and Guillermo\u2019s communication increased as the days rolled on. \u201cWithin just a few weeks, we just knew \u2013 without much discussion, without talking about it \u2013 we just knew that there was a very, very strong connection there,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cWe always had something to talk about,\u201d says Larry. Larry was still hesitant about jumping into something new, following the breakdown of his previous relationship. But the messages back and forth with Guillermo became a highlight of his day. And as time passed, he found himself opening up to Guillermo, confiding in him. \u201cAfter a few months, I was like, \u2018Yes, this is exactly what I was looking for my whole life. Someone that I can be my authentic self with,\u2019\u201d says Larry. Long-distance dating In September 2013, two months after their Palm Springs meeting, Larry arranged to visit Guillermo in Boston. At Logan Airport, Larry came down the escalator and spotted Guillermo\u2019s face in the crowd. He was beaming, and started running towards Larry. Then, Guillermo \u201chugged me so hard,\u201d recalls Larry. He remembers thinking, \u201cOh my god, this is the one.\u201d Then Guillermo and Larry went to Boston\u2019s seaport district together, and found a sundrenched rooftop bar where they sat drinking beers. \u201cWe could see the planes approaching Logan, and it was just a sunny and perfect Boston day,\u201d recalls Guillermo. \u201cI remember that, like a picture, sitting by the edge \u2013 I remember the beer and I remember the planes.\u201d It was \u201cmagical,\u201d says Guillermo, but also slightly \u201csurreal.\u201d The Palm Springs encounter was so brief. He never thought he\u2019d see Larry again. And now here Larry was, sitting opposite him, in Guillermo\u2019s city. From there, Guillermo and Larry started dating cross-country. They took advantage of Larry\u2019s discounted flights. Sometimes Larry traveled to Boston, but usually Guillermo visited Larry in Dallas. Guillermo\u2019s love of flying meant that, for him, the four-hour journey across the country was part of the fun. \u201cI was in heaven,\u201d he says. \u201cJust the fact that I was getting to do something that I have always just loved - which is being on an airplane and going somewhere.\u201d Each Friday, as he packed his bag and headed to the airport, Guillermo would also be struck with \u201cexcitement\u201d at the thought of seeing Larry. And during these weekend visits, Guillermo and Larry grew accustomed to each other\u2019s habits, how they moved through their days, how they liked to spend their time. Guillermo got to know Larry\u2019s friends and got to know Dallas as a city. They spoke about their hopes, dreams, ambitions and families. Guillermo says it was obvious that they were \u201cvery aligned on the important aspects of life: how we view finances, closeness with families, politically and world views and enjoyment of the small things in life.\u201d Larry supported Guillermo as he cared for his mother through her cancer, and celebrated with him when she recovered. \u201cFor us, it was a gradual process of falling in love,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cBut a theme for us in our life together is that everything felt right and natural.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t pinpoint the moment, but we simply knew very deep in our hearts that we found the life partner.\u201d \u201cThat made me so happy,\u201d says Larry. For Guillermo, moving to Dallas two years later, in late 2015, was \u201cjust as the easiest decision.\u201d Larry was thrilled. His Dallas-based friendship group had already welcomed Guillermo into the fold, and his parents were happy for him too. \u201cI introduced Guillermo to everybody,\u201d says Larry. \u201cMy family\u2019s always been very accepting of me.\u201d Guillermo\u2019s family situation was more complicated. He\u2019s always been very close with his parents and siblings, but for the first two decades of his adult life, he didn\u2019t talk to his family about relationships. \u201cMy personal life was not necessarily an open book,\u201d Guillermo says. \u201cLove has never been the question - my parents love me, I love my parents and my sisters, we all get along great. But there was always that invisible barrier, which was: I don\u2019t talk about my personal relationships.\u201d But Guillermo didn\u2019t want to hide Larry from anyone - he felt he owed that to himself, and to Larry. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to edit myself, I wasn\u2019t going to filter. I just knew deep in my heart that it was my chance to be able to truly be myself,\u201d he says. So Guillermo started peppering his phone calls home with mentions of Larry. He uploaded cute photos of the two of them to social media. \u201cI\u2019m fearless,\u201d he told himself. \u201cNothing bad can happen here.\u201d A monumental year Cut to 2018, which was a monumental year for Guillermo and Larry for a couple of reasons. For one, it was the year Guillermo followed in Larry\u2019s footsteps and became a flight attendant. It was a mutual friend who suggested Guillermo should give it a shot, and Larry \u2013 who\u2019d spent years listening to Guillermo wax lyrical about airplanes \u2013 was wholeheartedly encouraging. Guillermo applied to Larry\u2019s airline, American Airlines, but wasn\u2019t accepted. But then he applied to Delta, and was accepted on the spot. While Guillermo and Larry loved the idea of working together, flying with different airlines also \u201cworked out great,\u201d says Guillermo. For one, there were two different sets of airline benefits to enjoy. And working in the air was everything Guillermo hoped it would be and more. \u201cI was doing my dream job, my childhood dream job,\u201d he says. \u201cI still have to pinch myself that actually, I am a flight attendant.\u201d 2018 was also the year Guillermo and Larry got married. Guillermo proposed to Larry on an airplane. The couple were flying back to Dallas after visiting San Francisco, where they\u2019d attended an Adele concert. As they were descending, the Dallas lights glistening out the airplane window, Guillermo suddenly felt the time was right. He turned to Larry and asked him to marry him. Larry smiled, and said yes. \u201cDespite it being impromptu, as an aviation geek, I love that I proposed on a flight,\u201d says Guillermo. The couple started planning their nuptials. Guillermo was excited, but he was unsure what role \u2013 if any \u2013 his family would play on the wedding day. While Guillermo had mentioned Larry to his parents, they still hadn\u2019t met him. This was partly because Guillermo\u2019s family were in Costa Rica, and partly because Guillermo wasn\u2019t sure how that meeting would play out. \u201cThe person that I had the most trouble with was my father \u2013 because he was the one that had the hardest time really accepting me,\u201d says Guillermo. As plans for the wedding started to take shape, Guillermo composed a long email to his father. \u201cI said something to the effect of, \u2018Hey Dad, I know I really haven\u2019t really talked much about any of my personal life. But I met this person, Larry, who is the love of my life. We are going to get married. Come, don\u2019t come, no problem. But I just need to tell you because this is probably one of the most important days and times of my life.\u2019\u201d Guillermo\u2019s father didn\u2019t attend the wedding. \u201cFor those reasons and also because he was towards the end of his life, his mobility was a problem,\u201d Guillermo says. \u201cBut my mom, my sisters, my niece and my nephew came, which was far more than I ever imagined or dreamed. That was such a great moment.\u201d Guillermo introduced his mother and sisters to Larry a couple of days before the wedding. They all gathered at a rooftop bar in Dallas, along with Guillermo and Larry\u2019s close friends. When Guillermo\u2019s mother saw Larry for the first time, she enveloped Larry in her arms. The two hit it off right away. Guillermo was overwhelmed with happiness. \u201cFor me, to see Larry and mom interact \u2013 they just love each other so much,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cAnd my sisters just cannot get enough of him \u2013 I just sit back, and just enjoy.\u201d A magical wedding day Guillermo and Larry\u2019s wedding took place at the Dallas Arboretum, a botanical garden. It was an outdoor wedding, and the couple woke up to the rain pouring and concerned texts from guests worried how the wedding would play out in a downpour. \u201cBut then, sure enough, out came the sun at the right time,\u201d recalls Guillermo. Larry and Guillermo wrote their own vows and read them to each other during the ceremony. Guillermo told Larry that he inspired him to be a better son, sibling, friend and person. \u201cYou want a partner that is going to challenge you to be better,\u201d says Guillermo. \u201cI always feel that I want to be a better human being just in general, because he is such a figure in my life and everyone\u2019s life \u2013 he is the center of everybody\u2019s life.\u201d In turn, Larry promised Guillermo their married life would be \u201cexciting, adventurous and full of passion.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m proud to take you as my husband. I promise to fly with you to the ends of the earth,\u201d Larry said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to grow old together and look back at this beautiful moment.\u201d He ended the vows telling Guillermo: \u201cTe amo\u201d \u2013 Spanish for \u201cI love you.\u201d The reception was held at a local winery. During the celebrations, Guillermo and Larry danced to Rihanna\u2019s hit \u201cWe Found Love,\u201d which includes the lyric: \u201cWe found love in a hopeless place.\u201d The couple felt it was fitting \u2013 the resort they met at did seem a bit of a \u201chopeless place.\u201d And they never expected that brief meeting would lead to a lasting love. \u201cWe made sure that song was played, because we did find love in a hopeless place,\u201d says Larry. \u201cAnd I love Rihanna, too,\u201d says Guillermo. At one point, Guillermo and Larry walked through the reception doors holding hands, spontaneously lifting their arms in the air, a \u201cvictorious\u201d pose, as Guillermo put it. \u201cIt was just an electric effect,\u201d he says. The last piece of the puzzle A few years into their marriage, Guillermo and Larry visited Costa Rica together for the first time. Larry was excited to see Guillermo\u2019s home country, and Guillermo was excited to show his husband where he grew up \u2013 and the visit was also an opportunity for Larry to finally meet Guillermo\u2019s father. Guillermo was nervous about how the meeting would play out, but when he arrived at his parents\u2019 house with Larry in tow, Guillermo\u2019s father opened his arms and hugged Larry tightly. \u201cHe said, \u2018Welcome home,\u2019\u201d says Guillermo. It was a cathartic, emotional moment for everyone. \u201cI was so nervous that day, meeting the father-in-law,\u201d says Larry. \u201cAnd when he just said \u2018welcome home,\u2019 and hugged me, every bit of nerves went away. I felt comfortable, I felt welcomed, I felt loved.\u201d Larry says the moment felt like the \u201clast piece\u201d of a puzzle slotting into place. Guillermo was overjoyed. \u201cThat evening, which we got to spend \u2013 me, mom, dad, and Larry \u2013 was just a highlight,\u201d says Guillermo. The family played old records on a turntable. Guillermo and his mother danced in the living room, while Larry and Guillermo\u2019s father sipped cocktails and watched, laughing. \u201cI had to just step back, because you have to look at those moments and just kind of create a little mini movie of them,\u201d says Guillermo. Guillermo\u2019s father has since passed away, which makes Guillermo and Larry all the more grateful for that time together in Costa Rica. In general, a feeling of gratitude defines Guillermo and Larry\u2019s relationship \u2013 gratitude for each other and what they\u2019ve brought to one another\u2019s lives, and gratitude that their paths crossed over ten years ago. On their anniversary, the couple usually return to Palm Springs to celebrate the day they met. \u201cNot only is Palm Springs beautiful with a great vibe, but we love to go back and celebrate our meeting place,\u201d says Larry. \u201cWe weren\u2019t looking, neither one of us \u2013 but it did happen, and it\u2019s definitely for life.\u201d \u201cWhat a gift,\u201d says Guillermo, who says his life today is what he dreamed of \u201cas a little gay boy in Costa Rica, always loving the US, always loving airplanes, always envisioning that I would have a relationship where we are completely free to show our love.\u201d \u201cAnd we do, we do,\u201d he says. \u201cWho could ask for anything more?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/vacation-fling-love-story-chance-encounters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_article_eva-longoria-searching-for-mexico-restaurants", "text": "You\u2019ll no doubt be hungry after watching \u201cEva Longoria: Searching for Mexico.\u201d Every episode is full of mouthwatering regional specialties prepared by chefs all over the country. For those wanting to follow in Eva Longoria\u2019s footsteps, below is a guide to the restaurants and locations she visited. Veracruz: Cradle of Mexican gastronomy Longoria visits the coastal state of Veracuz. Its position along some 400 miles (645 kilometers) of the Caribbean Sea made it a focal point for military conflict \u2013 and the collision of food cultures. \u201cThe people of Veracruz took this treasure trove of ingredients passing in and out of the port and created a whole new cuisine,\u201d Longoria said. \u2022 Longoria met chef Erik Guerrero, who aims to make fishing more sustainable in Veracruz, at Namik restaurant, where they enjoyed ceviche with hot beans and soft shell crab taco. \u2022 Next up, she joined actor and friend Ana de la Reguera for some coffee at historic Caf\u00e9 La Parroquia, Veracruz Port. Tap on the glass three times to ring for milk. \u2022 She headed to the lush inland mountains to meet coffee farming expert Itzel Mendoza at Cafetal Privado en Coetzala to learn how the precious bean is grown. There, they gathered flowers in the fields to be added to chicken stew, a salsa and a palm flower fritter. \u2022 Back in Veracruz Port, she met food historian Nidia Hern\u00e1ndez Medel at Chuchumb\u00e9, a cultural center, to cook some fried yucca, which is traced back to the city\u2019s African slave era.  \u2022 It\u2019s back out of the city to meet with vanilla farmer Norma Gaya, of Gaya Vanilla and Spices, for some vanilla chicken. \u2022 At El Tajin ruins, a Totonac settlement, Longoria met cook Do\u00f1a Marta. She\u2019s the founder of Smoke Women, which keeps ancient Totonac traditions alive. They enjoyed alcamaya (fresh-water shrimp) stew and mushroom empanadas. \u2022  Chef Luis Palmeros, a rising star on the Mexican food scene, introduces Longoria to traditional cook Do\u00f1a Rocio at Cuarto Blanco Market in the inland city of Xalapa (the capital of Veracruz state), for a traditional stuffed jalape\u00f1o. He then takes Longoria to his restaurant, El Cuarto Blanco, for his modern take on the dish. Jalisco: Birthplace of traditions \u2022 At Tortas Ahogadas El Pr\u00edncipe Heredero in Guadalajara, Longoria samples a torta ahogada \u2013 the region\u2019s beloved \u201cdrowned\u201d sandwich. \u2022 In Guadalajara\u2019s Santa Teresita neighborhood, Longoria samples a new preparation of native ingredient chinchayote at Xokol, a restaurant run by chefs \u00d3scar Segundo and Xrysw Ruelas D\u00edaz. \u2022 Longoria attends a charreada, a Mexican rodeo, that takes place at Lienzo Charro Charros De Jalisco. Afterward, she sampled birria, the celebrated goat stew from Jalisco, at the clubhouse. \u2022 Chef Fabian Delgado Padilla treats Longoria to mole with pork belly at his restaurant palReal in Guadlajara\u2019s Colonia Americana neighborhood. \u2022 At Lake Chapala, about 30 miles south of Guadalajara, Longoria meets with members of one of the oldest indigenous groups in Mexico, the Coca people, to talk about their fight to preserve their way of life and history on the lake. They feast on local fish called charales. \u2022 Longoria meets friends Mariana Padilla and Alejandra Pelayo at traditional cantina La Iberia in Guadalajara. Women weren\u2019t allowed in cantinas until the 1980s, Longoria said. \u2022 Then she heads to to the town of Tequila, where Salvador Rosales Trejo shows her how tequila is produced by Tequila Cascahuin using traditional methods. \u2022 Longoria and chef Fabian Delgado Padilla visit Yunaites, his casual restaurant inside a municipal market in Guadalajara, for gorditas topped with pork and mole. Nuevo Le\u00f3n: Where beef is king Say adios to vegetables for a while. Nuevo Le\u00f3n is the land of meat. In this state in northeast Mexico, carne asada is a go-to meal. And it\u2019s the cuisine Longoria grew up with in Texas.  \u2022 In Monterrey, Longoria met up with Alejandro Guti\u00e9rrez, founder of the Mexican Society of Grill Masters, to try the region\u2019s specialty: carne asada (grilled meat). In August, there\u2019s a grill master competition in Santiago, outside of Monterrey. \u2022 Tacos Do\u00f1a Mary La Gritona has been serving breakfast tacos in Monterrey for nearly 20 years. \u201cThese are the best tortillas I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d said Longoria. \u2022 El Jonuco restaurant celebrates the products of Nuevo Le\u00f3n with a focus on seasonal ingredients. They\u2019re known for their cabrito (roasted goat). The restaurant celebrates the little-known history of crypto-Judaism in the region, Longoria said. \u2022 Dona Lupita\u2019s Caf\u00e9, located in the backyard of her home right next to Highway 85 south of Monterrey, is famed for its legendary tamales. \u2022 La Divinita bakery is one of the most successful bakery chains in Monterrey. The founder uses local oranges to make a traditional dessert with Longoria. \u2022 Koli restaurant, run by the three Rivera Rio brothers, is a fine dining restaurant that aims to tell the story of Nuevo Le\u00f3n. Oaxaca: A gastronomic capital Nestled within three vast mountain ranges, Oaxaca is a magnet for food lovers in the know.  A thrill of any visit here is sampling the moles, as well as dishes such as tlayudas (thin Oaxacan \u201cpizzas\u201d), spicy hot chocolate and asado grilled in smoky market stalls. \u201cIt is on another level gastronomically, one of the best places I\u2019ve been to in the world,\u201d Longoria said. \u2022 Mercado de Abastos is a giant market on the edge of Oaxaca City. If you want your chocolate fix, the mercado is still the place to come. This region is known for its moles \u2013 complex sauces featuring many blended ingredients.  \u2022 Casa Oaxaca makes Oaxaca\u2019s famous mole negro drizzled over turkey breast. Longoria called it a magnificently complex and sophisticated sauce. \u2022 At Las Quince Letras, chef Celia Flori\u00e1n made Longoria quesillo \u2013 a stretched Oaxacan cheese --  with crickets and edible flowers. \u2022 In the area of Oaxaca located on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, several muxes, who identify as a third gender and are guardians of Zapotecan cuisine, cooked up stuffed pork with pineapple served alongside pureed potatoes. Longoria called it \u201cthe perfect combination.\u201d \u2022 The farming town of Santa Ana Zegache is the unassuming epicenter of corn. Corn has been worshipped for over 6,000 years and is still the beating heart of Mexican cuisine.  \u2022 In San Baltazar Chichicapam, Longoria visited a palenque (agave farm) run by Do\u00f1a Berta, one of very few female mezcaleras. The farm produces mezcal, the smoky liquor for which this region is famed. \u2022 La Cocina de Humo is a hip restaurant using local ingredients. Chef Thalia Barrios Garc\u00eda is known for her heirloom tomato salad with beet puree and herbal dressing. Longoria said it\u2019s the \u201cperfect dish.\u201d Here\u2019s the recipe.   Yucat\u00e1n: Defined by the Maya Mayan DNA runs through the recipes in Yucat\u00e1n, which has the largest Maya population in Mexico.  The state is located along the Gulf of Mexico and is surrounded by dense forests that isolate it off from the rest of the country. The Maya thrived here for thousands of years before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors in the 1500s. The region\u2019s geography and turbulent history have had a significant impact on the cuisine. \u2022 Ixi\u2019im mixes modern and ancestral techniques and flavors. The restaurant has its own version of the most famous dish from the Yucat\u00e1n, cochinita pibil. Chef Luis Ronz\u00f3n slow-cooks pork underground after it\u2019s marinated in sour orange and spices.  \u2022 Condimentos Enrique is a family-run business that sells recados (spice pastes) in Mercado de Santiago in M\u00e9rida. \u2022 At Huniik, which means \u201cunique spirit\u201d in Maya, chef Roberto Sol\u00eds makes onion tempura with black recado. \u201cI have never had anything like this. This is gorgeous, and it\u2019s delicious,\u201d said Longoria.  \u2022 In his home in Xoc\u00e9n, chef Alberto Kuku prepared one of the oldest dishes, Mayan chicken tamales, for Hanal Pix\u00e1n, a holiday celebrated by the Maya people that means \u201cfood for the souls.\u201d The food honoring the dead \u201ccan easily be carried back to the underworld,\u201d he said. \u2022 Chef Regina Escalante, who runs Merci in M\u00e9rida, showed Longoria how to make grilled seabass with mango, avocado and flor de sal. \u201cI\u2019d have this as my last meal on Earth,\u201d said Longoria. Here\u2019s the recipe. \u2022 At Uxmal, Mayan archaeologist Don Pepe cooked up smoked pork and bean stew. It cooks underground for 12 hours.  \u2022 Kinich in Izamal is famous for its queso relleno. A key ingredient is, surprisingly, Dutch cheese. See how it\u2019s made:  Mexico City: The city of tacos \u201cIt\u2019s crazy, it\u2019s crowded, it\u2019s noisy \u2013 and I love it!\u201d Longoria said as she walked the streets of Mexico City, where she lives part-time with her family. This region was once the capital of the mighty Aztec empire, known as Tenochtitl\u00e1n until the Spanish invaded about 500 years ago and changed its name to Mexico City. Here are the places Eva Longoria visited in the episode: \u2022 Tomasa is a Mexican bakery known for its conchas, a fluffy sweet bread with a crunchy topping.  \u2022 El Huequito in the Historic Center serves up delicious al pastor tacos, which are a staple in Mexico City. \u2022 Tacos Los Alexis is sizzling hot in the taco world. Owner Alexis Ayala uses his five-star culinary training to transform traditional recipes from his childhood into to-die-for gourmet tacos.  \u2022 Contramar in Roma, the bohemian part of town, is one of Longoria\u2019s favorite restaurants. Owner and chef Gabriela C\u00e1mara made her signature dish: pescado a la talla. \u2022 M\u00e1ximo Bistrot, a gourmet restaurant that marries French and Mexican cuisine, is run by chef Eduardo \u201cLalo\u201d Garc\u00eda. For Longoria, he made a roasted beet salad with rocket and wilted purslane. Best known as a weed, purslane is nonetheless edible and very nutritious. \u2022 Mercado de Jamaica is one of hundreds of markets in the city. At the street food stalls, Longoria tried green chorizo tacos and tlacoyos, thick oval-shaped tortillas typically stuffed with beans or cheese. \u2022 Casa Tochan refugee shelter is the first shelter for immigrants in Mexico City. The residents cook dishes from their homeland to share with their housemates.  \u2022 El Moro is an institution famous for its churros and chocolate. \u2022 Hiyoko restaurant in Little Tokyo cooks up a Mexican-Japanese fusion. Chef and restaurateur Edo L\u00f3pez whipped up tapioca tostadas, chicken skewers with ants and duck donburi.  After each episode, we\u2019ll add to this story with the latest locations where you can sample food featured in \u201cSearching for Mexico.\u201d  Sign up for CNN\u2019s Unlocking Mexico newsletter.

But an Air New Zealand plane had a very different reason for making an unplanned stop yesterday \u2013 they were picking up the country\u2019s prime minister after his government aircraft broke down. New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and a group of prominent business leaders were en route to Tokyo for a summit with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. They were traveling on a Royal New Zealand Defense Force plane, which stopped in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea to refuel. That\u2019s when disaster struck \u2013 the plane, a Boeing 757 that is more than 30 years old, had a fuse issue and couldn\u2019t continue the journey. Luxon\u2019s office confirmed the plane\u2019s breakdown to Reuters. Luckily, one of the 50-some business leaders in the delegation was Air New Zealand (ANZ) CEO Greg Foran. He then arranged for an ANZ commercial flight traveling from Auckland to Tokyo to swing by Port Moresby and pick up some of the stranded passengers, including Luxon, the airline confirmed to CNN. Coincidentally, Luxon, who was elected in 2023, spent seven years as the CEO of Air New Zealand before getting into politics. New Zealand\u2019s defense minister, Judith Collins, called the situation \u201cembarrassing\u201d in an interview with Kiwi radio station Newstalk ZB. \u201cWe have a very old aircraft and we are expecting it to perform like brand new out of the box and that\u2019s simply not going to happen,\u201d Collins said. \u201cNo PM wants to spend an awful amount of money on something that\u2019s seen as nice to have by some people.\u201d This isn\u2019t the first time a plane breakdown has left a New Zealand leader stranded. In 2022, then-Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was forced to spend additional time at the country\u2019s Scott Base in Antarctica when the plane that was supposed to take her back home had a mechanical issue. She and her team ended up getting a ride on an Italian military jet.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/travel/christopher-luxon-air-new-zealand-plane-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_article_bear-encounters-prevent-attacks-wellness", "text": "You\u2019re out for a hike, reveling in glorious nature. Suddenly, you spot a bear. And the bear has spotted you, too. Would you know what to do next? Beth Pratt sure would. She was once on the Old Gardiner Road Trail in Yellowstone National Park, enjoying her run in wild nature. Her reverie came to an end when she came upon a grizzly bear eating flowers.  \u201cI stopped. It stood on its hind legs and looked at me. I knew that wasn\u2019t a threatening gesture,\u201d she told CNN Travel. \u201cI\u2019m not kidding, it waved its paw at me as if to say, \u2018just go on your way,\u2019 and went back to eating.\u201d \u201cAnd I walked slowly away and put some distance between us, and the encounter ended fine.\u201d When it comes to dealing with bears, Pratt does have a thing or two on almost all the rest of us, though. She is the California regional executive director for the National Wildlife Federation, a job she\u2019s had for more than 10 years. She worked in Yellowstone for several years \u2013 and once saw nine grizzlies in one day there.    Finally, she lives on the border of Yosemite National Park, and bears will pass through her yard, including this one seen in the footage above in late September 2021. You can hear the enthusiasm in Pratt\u2019s voice as she shares her bear bona fides and advice to make sure bear/human encounters are delightful, not dangerous. \u201cA wild bear is a beautiful sight to see. It\u2019s incredible to see them in the wild. I never had a bad experience with bears. What I try to get people to feel is respect, not fear, for bears. The animal usually wants to avoid the encounters.\u201d  Bears in the news   Bear attacks are rare, Pratt and US National Park Service websites point out, but they do happen:  \u2022 A disable veteran survived an attack from a mother grizzly at Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming in May 2024. \u201cIt was the most violent thing I have ever experienced.\u201d \u2022 A hunter suffered serious injuries in a grizzly bear attack in British Columbia in May 2024. \u2022 Bear attacks are on the increase in Japan. \u2022 A man lost part of his jaw in a grizzly bear attack in Montana in September 2023. \u2022 Two people died in a suspected grizzly bear attack in Canada\u2019s Banff National Park in late September 2023. \u2022 Two collegiate wrestlers were mauled by a grizzly bear near Cody, Wyoming, in October 2022; they had serious injuries but survived. They illustrate the point that rare doesn\u2019t equal never. Feasts for beasts  While it pays to be diligent at any time, autumn is a particularly good season to bone up on bear facts and safety when many bears are in a phase known as hyperphagia, Pratt said. \u201cIt\u2019s a period in the fall where bears are eating anything and everything to fatten up for hibernation.\u201d  She noted mountain lions are comparatively picky eaters. Not bears.   \u201cThey eat everything: Ants. Roadkill. Flowers. Nuts. And unfortunately, human food that\u2019s not secured. Our food is very attractive to them; it\u2019s easy calories.\u201d   Combine that with the fact that some national and state parks have become very popular and crowded, and you have a recipe for potential trouble. \u201cIf more people are using public lands and more people are in the mix, there\u2019s more potential for encounters and conflict. It does concern me a little bit,\u201d Pratt said. The key is being prepared \u2013 and that\u2019s where Pratt and others in the know come in. First rule of \u2018bear fight club\u2019: Don\u2019t fight The best strategy is to never get in harm\u2019s way by enticing or provoking a wild bear. Trying to give a bear food or approaching cute cubs are particularly terrible ways to start an encounter. That\u2019s just looking for trouble. The US National Park Service site points out each bear and each encounter is different, but there are general guidelines useful in most situations. First of all, keep your distance if you happen upon a bear. Don\u2019t approach it, and give it plenty of room to walk away from you. Yellowstone tells you to stay at least 100 yards (300 feet or 91 meters) away; Shenandoah National Park in Virginia suggests 200 feet (61 meters) for its black bears. You can run afoul of the law as well as the bears if you get too close and end up paying a fine.   Other tips: \u2022 Talk calmly to yourself in low tones to identify yourself as human. \u2022 Walk with a group (we\u2019re smellier and noisier in packs) and stay on designated trails. \u2022 If you have a small child or dog, pick it up. \u2022 Don\u2019t put yourself between cubs and their mother. \u2022  Avoid direct eye contact and move away slowly, sideways if possible. Pratt said don\u2019t be alarmed if a bear stands on its hind legs; it\u2019s not considered an aggressive move. Almost all encounters are peaceful, Pratt said. Many times, people never knew they were even close to a bear, as in this YouTube video that shows two people emerging from a basement oblivious to a nearby bear.  What if a bear starts coming at you anyway?  If a bear starts making assertive moves in your direction, you have important decisions to make \u2013 and fast. First thing is: Stand your ground with bears. With either grizzlies (a subspecies of brown bears) or black bears, \u201cplease don\u2019t run. Bears can outrun anybody,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cDon\u2019t climb a tree either. They can also climb trees better than you.\u201d  New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Division of Fish and Wildlife (where the black bear population is growing) also has some tips: \u2022 Make loud noises by yelling, banging pots and pans or using an airhorn to scare bears away. \u2022 Make yourself look as large as possible by waving your arms.  \u2022 If you\u2019re with other people, stay together. Pratt said you can usually intimidate or bluff your way out of sticky bear situations, depending on the bear species and the situation.  But what if a bear is about to attack? You\u2019re now in the rarest of situations \u2013 you\u2019ve attracted a bear\u2019s attention. It didn\u2019t move off. It\u2019s started coming at you aggressively and fast. You think you\u2019re about to be attacked. What\u2019s next? One very crucial thing is to make a quick ID of the kind of bear, because your strategy is going to be different depending on the type of bear.  If it\u2019s a black bear, the NPS and Pratt have a clear message: Do not run. Do not play dead. \u201cYou want to stand your ground with black bears. Look as intimidating as possible,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cThrow things not at it but near it. Make that black bear intimidated by you. Let it know you are a big person. Pick something up; yell at it. If it attacks, fight back \u2013 aim for the face.\u201d It\u2019s a different situation with grizzlies If you\u2019re dealing with a grizzly that won\u2019t back off and an attack is imminent, you\u2019re advised to do the opposite. You should play dead. \u201cAct as unthreatening as possible with a grizzly. Play dead with a grizzly if it starts to attack,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cTuck and cover. Get into a fetal position. Wrap your hands around your neck. Lay on your stomach. Once you do that, 99 percent of the time the grizzly will move on.\u201d  NPS elaborates: \u201cRemain still until the bear leaves the area. Fighting back usually increases the intensity of such attacks. However, if the attack persists, fight back vigorously.\u201d   Fighting back a grizzly bear is the last resort \u2013 \u201cyour Hail Mary pass\u201d as Pratt called it \u2013 when all other options are out. An exception to this rule: If you\u2019re camping in a tent and are attacked, that bear likely sees you as food. NPS and Pratt say this is a time to fight. How do you tell a black bear from a grizzly? First off, know your area and read up on the bears there. In North America, grizzlies have a much more limited range than black bears do. In the Lower 48, they are in Washington, Montana, Idaho and Wyoming. And then in Alaska, too. They also cover large parts of western Canada. Black bears have more territory. They can be found in as many as 40 US states, much of Canada and even parts of northern Mexico, the National Wildlife Federation says. So say you\u2019re in Quebec, the Appalachians, the Ozarks, California or even parts of Florida, that\u2019s going to be a black bear. But if you\u2019re in Yellowstone or Glacier National Park, for instance, that could be a black bear or a grizzly. That\u2019s when it\u2019s crucial to know how to make a quick visual ID. You can\u2019t go by the color of the fur. Black bears can be black, brown, cinnamon, blond, blue-gray or white, according to Bear.org.  One of the best ways to tell the difference, Pratt said, is to look for a hump at the shoulders. Grizzlies have them. Black bears don\u2019t. She also said the face shapes are different. \u201cBlack bear faces look a little more cuddly to me, a little rounder, with a straight nose. A grizzly bear face looks more like a wild predator and has a dished shape.\u201d This NPS webpage has more helpful ways to tell the differences. Fun facts: Eight bear species can be found all over the world \u2013 from tropical Sri Lanka to the frigid reaches of Russia, Norway and Canada. And European websites such as Bear Watching Slovenia give many of the same safety tips as North Americans get. Bear spray and weapons Some people like to carry bear spray and/or a weapon with them when venturing into bear country.  Pratt is an advocate of the former and says be sure to practice using it first before going into the wild. NPS has helpful tips on using spray to ward off bears. She\u2019s more cautious about bringing firearms with you, especially if you\u2019re inexperienced. \u201cTaking a grizzly out with one shot would be tough. You need to be very experienced with a gun to increase your chance of safety.\u201d A Brigham Young University study in 2008 found spray more effective than a firearm. And spray doesn\u2019t permanently harm a bear. Some people like to carry bear bells on their hikes, hoping the noise will ward off the animals. But the park service says that \u201cYelling, clapping and talking are more effective ways of alerting a bear to your presence.\u201d What campers need to know If you\u2019re out camping overnight, you have extra considerations to take. Kyle Patterson, management specialist and public affairs officer at Rocky Mountain National Park, emailed CNN Travel some ways to keep hungry bears away. Patterson advised using a food storage locker if provided in campgrounds and picnic areas. Also, \u201cavoid storing food and coolers in your vehicle. If you must, store food in airtight containers in the trunk or out of sight. Close vehicle windows completely.\u201d Other tips and cautions: \u2022 Don\u2019t store food in tents or pop-up campers in campgrounds or in vehicles at trailheads. \u2022 Don\u2019t leave food, coolers and dirty cookware unattended. Park rangers may confiscate them and cite you. \u2022 Get rid of garbage in bear-resistant dumpsters and trash cans. Human-fed bears usually end up as chronic problems and need to be removed, Patterson said. \u201cA fed bear is a dead bear.\u201d The ball is in our court Pratt emphasized it\u2019s up to humans to be responsible to these creatures. \u201cThe bears are just being bears. We are way more of a threat to them. Bear attacks are so rare. And fatalities are even rarer,\u201d she said. \u201cThe bears\u2019 lives are more at threat than ours in encounters. I want people to have magical, wonderful experiences in the wild. I want people to feel OK about having these encounters.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/article/bear-encounters-prevent-attacks-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "travel_stood-up-met-love-of-life-chance-encounters", "text": "When the guy she\u2019d met on the plane asked her out, Cristina Farina said yes without hesitation. Cristina had spent much of the flight to London from her Italian hometown Florence deep in conversation with this stranger. He seemed friendly, interesting, interested. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we meet tomorrow, go have a coffee, spend some time together?\u201d he suggested. \u201cLet\u2019s meet at 11 on Trafalgar Square.\u201d Upon landing at Heathrow Airport, Cristina and her plane crush went their separate ways, vowing to meet the next day. It was August 26, 1984. They didn\u2019t swap addresses or contact numbers. Texting wasn\u2019t an option. They just had to hope they\u2019d both keep their promise and be there the following day. Cristina grabbed her bag from the luggage carousel and headed into central London, feeling invigorated and excited. She was 18 years old, set to spend three months in the UK studying English. It was Cristina\u2019s first significant period away from home. Possibility stretched out before her. \u201cI loved London,\u201d Cristina tells CNN Travel today. \u201cIt gave me a lot of energy. I felt free to do what I wanted.\u201d The next day, shortly before 11 a.m., Cristina climbed the steps out of Charing Cross tube station and arrived in Trafalgar Square \u2013 an open, pedestrianized spot home to fountains, the UK\u2019s National Gallery and the imposing Nelson\u2019s Column, guarded by four large bronze lions. Trafalgar Square\u2019s almost always busy, and that day in 1984 was no different. Crowds of tourists dodged low flying pigeons as they lined up for entry to the gallery. Outside the South African embassy, protestors were opposing apartheid. It was sunny, with a warm breeze, and there were plenty of sunbathers sitting on the gallery steps and dotted around the square. Cristina searched for her airplane date among the throngs of people. There was no sign of him, but she was a bit early. Time ticked on. He was still nowhere to be seen. \u201cThe guy never showed up,\u201d says Cristina today. Getting stood up wasn\u2019t exactly how Cristina had imagined beginning her London adventure. She was a bit disheartened. She had no way of contacting her plane crush. But while waiting for him to show, she\u2019d had plenty of time to scan the other people in Trafalgar Square that day. And one person in particular had caught her eye. \u201cI saw this guy sitting in between the lions,\u201d Cristina recalls. \u201cHe caught my attention because he was good looking \u2013 long hair, kind of a hippyish look.\u201d He was leaning on the plinth between the bronze lions, reading a book. As Cristina got closer, she saw it was a copy of William Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cRomeo and Juliet.\u201d The guy was also listening to a walkman. As Cristina approached, he took off his headphones, looked up and smiled. \u201cHi,\u201d Cristina said. \u201cHi,\u201d he replied. Feeling bold, Cristina sat down next to the stranger. He looked a little surprised, but he put down his book and smiled at her again. \u201cThen we just started talking,\u201d says Cristina today. Two days in London The guy leaning on the Trafalgar Square lions was 20-year-old Matt Reinecke, an American college student on vacation with his family, visiting from California. It turned out Matt had spotted Cristina before she approached him. \u201cWhy does this pretty girl keep looking at me?\u201d he thought. Then, when Cristina spoke to him, then sat down next to him, Matt was thrilled. \u201cI was traveling, and I knew that I was leaving in two days. And then a cute girl sat down next to me \u2013 that was enough for me,\u201d he tells CNN Travel today. Matt and Cristina introduced themselves, and Cristina gestured to Matt\u2019s walkman, asking what he\u2019d been listening to. Matt explained he was a huge fan of the Grateful Dead \u2013 he\u2019d been to several of their tour dates in the US. Then, Matt asked Cristina what brought her to London, and she spoke about her excitement about her upcoming three months away from home. There was a bit of a language barrier \u2013 Cristina couldn\u2019t always understand Matt\u2019s Americanisms \u2013 she was more used to British English. But the connection between them was palpable right away. \u201cI liked him immediately,\u201d says Cristina. For the next two hours, Matt and Cristina sat, side by side, in Trafalgar Square, talking. At some point, Matt got out his camera and took a photo of Cristina, leaning against the monument, looking at him. Eventually, Matt had to leave to meet his parents. \u201cBut what are you doing later today?\u201d he asked Cristina. \u201cWant to meet for a drink?\u201d Matt and Cristina made plans to meet a few hours later. Matt\u2019s family was staying at Claridge\u2019s, the historic, swanky five star hotel in Mayfair. He told Cristina he\u2019d meet her outside Bond Street Station. Unlike Cristina\u2019s would-be airplane date, Matt showed up. Matt\u2019s parents knew he was going on a spontaneous date. They were also having a drink at a different spot on Bond Street, and asked Matt if he\u2019d walk by with Cristina, so they could take a peek and wave hello. Matt and Cristina obliged, giggling as they walked by and saw Matt\u2019s parents\u2019 curious but friendly faces. Then, sitting in a pub together, Matt and Cristina picked up where they\u2019d left off. They shared their first kiss. Cristina left the pub in a daze. She and Matt had made plans to meet again. He only had one more day left in London, but wanted to spend it with Cristina. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait,\u201d Cristina recalls. \u201cI was really looking forward to seeing him the next day.\u201d The next day, the sun was also shining. Cristina and Matt headed to Hyde Park. \u201cWe really just kissed and talked all day in the park,\u201d recalls Matt. This time, Cristina took a photo of Matt, on her camera. In the picture he\u2019s smiling, looking away from the camera, wearing his Grateful Dead t-shirt. Matt\u2019s flight wasn\u2019t until the evening, so he put off leaving for as long as possible. When he finally said goodbye, Matt passed Cristina a note. \u201cDon\u2019t open it until you get home,\u201d he told her. Cristina obliged. She was staying with a host family organized by the language school. She waited until she got back to her room and unfurled the paper. \u201cThe note said, \u2018I can\u2019t bear the thought of never seeing you again,\u2019\u201d recalls Cristina today. She remembers welling up. \u201cI knew I was going to see him again. And I knew I was going to spend time with him somewhere, somehow.\u201d Lost letters Despite that feeling of certainty, Cristina still felt heartbroken. And she felt lonely. She wished her girlfriends from Italy were close by so she could talk through her emotions. Instead, dug out some paper from her bag and wrote a long letter to her best friend back home, telling her about Matt, about their whirlwind romance. \u201cI was completely wrapped up in these two days I spent with him,\u201d says Cristina. The next day, the woman Cristina was staying with noticed her bloodshot eyes and asked Cristina what was wrong. In the absence of anyone else to speak to, Cristina confided in her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll see him again,\u201d said Cristina\u2019s host. \u201cDo you have his address?\u201d Cristina did have \u2013 scrawled on a piece of paper \u2013 Matt\u2019s college address. He was still traveling around Europe with his parents, and wouldn\u2019t be back there for a while. But Cristina wrote him a letter anyway. And while she didn\u2019t receive a reply right away, Cristina settled into her London life. The feeling of heartbreak faded a little, and she made friends. \u201cI had a wonderful time,\u201d she recalls. Matt was still in the back of her mind. Weeks passed, and she didn\u2019t hear from him. She sent another letter. Still nothing. Surely he was back at school by now? Maybe she had the wrong address? \u201cSo I tried to find out his parents\u2019 address instead,\u201d recalls Cristina. \u201cI knew they\u2019d been staying at Claridge\u2019s, so I contacted Claridge\u2019s, asking for the address. Of course, they couldn\u2019t give me the address of the parents. But they told me, \u2018Send the letter to us, and we\u2019ll forward it to them.\u2019 So that\u2019s what happened.\u201d It turned out Matt hadn\u2019t received Cristina\u2019s first letters. \u201cI was a university student, so I was changing apartments every year,\u201d he explains today. \u201cAnd then they would never forward the mail.\u201d Cristina\u2019s idea of writing to Matt\u2019s parents\u2019 address was a good one. \u201cFinally, he got all my letters,\u201d says Cristina. And eventually, when Cristina was back in Italy, Matt\u2019s reply arrived: \u201cFour pages folded into one small envelope that had me very emotional and excited,\u201d as Cristina recalls. \u201cI locked myself in my room and read it slowly over and over again.\u201d Even with correct addresses established, Cristina remained the driving force behind their keeping in touch. It wasn\u2019t that Matt wasn\u2019t interested \u2013 he thought about Cristina often, daydreaming about those magical two days in London. But letter writing didn\u2019t come naturally to him in the same way it did her. Still, over the next two years, Cristina and Matt kept up a epistolery correspondence. A couple of times, they spoke on the phone but \u201cvery rarely,\u201d because of the steep transatlantic phone costs. And even as months, then years passed without them seeing one another, Cristina and Matt believed they would one day reunite, just as Matt promised in the note he\u2019d given Cristina when he left London. \u201cI knew I was going to come back,\u201d says Matt. \u201cI had the certainty that I was going to see him again,\u201d says Cristina. As time went on, their letters became more detailed. Matt would send Cristina his sociology college essays and Cristina loved this, getting to see how Matt\u2019s brain worked, getting a glimpse into his political views, his perspective on the world. And while Cristina\u2019s early letters were \u201cmainly about my daily life, my friends, my family, my travels,\u201d as time went on, she \u201cwrote about my feelings, my dreams.\u201d \u201cThe letters became more important as our relationship grew, as we got to know each other over time,\u201d says Matt. Reuniting in Florence 1986 rolled around. In a letter, Matt told Cristina he was planning to visit Europe that summer. His goal was to get to Greece, but \u2013 if it was okay with Cristina and her family \u2013 he\u2019d plan a stop off in Florence, where Cristina lived with her parents. \u201cI was super excited,\u201d says Cristina. \u201cA bit nervous because he had to meet my family, but overall I was the happiest girl on Earth.\u201d Cristina\u2019s parents knew about her London romance. They saw the way she reacted to the arrival of Matt\u2019s letters. They were still a little skeptical about the whole thing. And when Matt arrived at their home \u2013 in clothes crumpled from traveling and with long hair \u2013 they were even more skeptical. \u201cBut eventually they started to like him,\u201d says Cristina. \u201cHe was a good influence in my family \u2013 he was fun, he made people laugh. He didn\u2019t speak a word of Italian. But he started to speak slowly, by learning slowly, by listening to my parents and my brother, who was a couple years younger than I was.\u201d In the end, Matt never made it to Greece. Instead, he spent three months with Cristina in Italy. Matt says their reunion was an exciting, romantic \u201cblur.\u201d \u201cIt was a dream,\u201d says Cristina. \u201cIt was a movie type of thing.\u201d At the end of the summer, Matt returned to the US to finish college. Later that year, Cristina visited him in California. In summer 1987, Matt graduated college and headed straight to Italy to see Cristina. He got a job as an English teacher in Florence, found an apartment in the city and ended up living there for the next 18 months. After years of long distance, Matt and Cristina were finally in the same country. They weren\u2019t just pen pals, they were finally dating. \u201cThat\u2019s when we decided, we\u2019re going to live together forever,\u201d says Matt. \u201cI was still only 21, I was very young,\u201d says Cristina. \u201cBut I was very convinced that he was for me.\u201d Still, the future was still a bit uncertain. Matt felt like his teaching job was more of a stop gap than a permanent career. And Cristina had loved California when she\u2019d visited Matt the year before. Living there became a goal for them both. So Matt returned to the US in early 1989 and went back to college, getting another degree in sociology and economics. And in 1990, Cristina followed him to California. A California chapter Cristina\u2019s parents had grown to love Matt, but they were a bit worried about their daughter relocating across the world. \u201cBut they understood that it was time to try and see if things would work out,\u201d says Cristina. Meanwhile, Matt\u2019s parents were supportive, but they were from wealthy Californian society, and Matt reckons they\u2019d always imagined him meeting a girl at a San Francisco debutante ball. \u201cMy parents were more wanting me to be a part of upper class San Francisco life, and not running off to Italy,\u201d says Matt. \u201cWe were from different backgrounds,\u201d says Cristina. \u201cMy family was a normal middle class Italian family.\u201d Despite their differences, Matt and Cristina\u2019s time together in California felt like a turning point. They got their own apartment and for the first time, it felt like they were \u201cfree of outside, external things like parents, family, different things.\u201d They could be \u201cjust Matt and Cristina as a couple,\u201d as Matt puts it. Matt worked long hours at an investment bank, but even though his job was full-on, the couple made the most of their time together. Their apartment was always full of friends. They went out in San Francisco regularly. They grew closer and more sure of their future together. \u201cThe relationship had already been building, but really it just blossomed in San Francisco,\u201d says Matt. \u201cIt was a wonderful time of our lives, you\u2019re in your mid to late 20s, we\u2019re living on Union Street, one of the most beautiful neighborhoods of San Francisco. We had so many friends.\u201d Matt and Cristina were committed to a future together, but the decision to get married came about rather suddenly. In 1991, Cristina received a letter from US immigration giving her two weeks to leave the country. And so on April 12, 1991 Matt and Cristina got married in San Francisco\u2019s City Hall with only Matt\u2019s mother and a few friends present. But they planned a big wedding celebration for later that year in Italy, at the 13th century Sant\u2019Angostino Church in Prato, Tuscany. \u201cOur wedding day was a lot of fun,\u201d recalls Cristina. The service was entirely in Italian. By then, Matt was pretty proficient in the language, but some of his relatives were a bit confused. Despite the language barrier, they couldn\u2019t fail to interpret the happiness on Matt and Cristina\u2019s faces, and the joy that emanated through the day. \u201cIt was a beautiful wedding,\u201d says Matt. New adventures In the summer of 1993, Matt and Cristina embarked on a new adventure together. They quit their jobs in the US and spent half a year traveling \u2013 visiting Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Australia. Then, at the end of that traveling period, the couple left California behind and moved to Italy. \u201cWe decided to try to move back to Europe, to see if Italy works for us,\u201d says Cristina. \u201cWe said, \u2018Okay, let\u2019s do it,\u2019 without thinking too much.\u201d In Italy, Matt and Cristina settled first in Milan, where they welcomed their first child, Davide, in 1997. Later, Matt\u2019s investment banking work later took them to Turin, where their daughter Francesca was born in 2003. In the mid-noughties, Matt and Cristina moved to Tuscany. They liked the idea of being closer to Cristina\u2019s parents. And after decades spent living in big cities, the Tuscan countryside was a welcome change of pace. The couple bought a run down 1600s farmhouse and focused on restructuring the house and making it into a family home. They were also kept busy by work. From 2008 until 2019, Matt and Cristina ran an American bakery in Florence, called Mama\u2019s Bakery. \u201cI think I\u2019ve made somewhere between 400,000 to 500,000 bagels,\u201d says Matt. \u201cI was the bagel king of Italy for a while.\u201d Running the business together was hard work, but rewarding. \u201cWe were a good team, we complemented each other,\u201d says Matt. \u201cIt is really difficult on family time, but we often had fun together at work. I am happy we had the experience, but I am happier that we sold the business.\u201d Life today Matt and Cristina left Mama\u2019s Bakery behind in 2019. Now, they\u2019re retired, and their focus is on traveling, spending time with their kids and enjoying their home in Tuscany. \u201cWe do exactly what we want to do,\u201d says Cristina. \u201cWe\u2019re fortunate we can do that,\u201d says Matt. After years of working and living in Italy, Matt\u2019s fluent in Italian. Matt and Cristina\u2019s children are bilingual. \u201cOur conversation in the house switches back and forth between English and Italian mid-sentence,\u201d says Matt. \u201cWho would have ever thought that I\u2019d live half my life in Italy? It\u2019s weird how just a brief second can change things in a wonderful way.\u201d For Matt and Cristina, it\u2019s surreal but special to reflect on their first meeting in Trafalgar Square, 40 years ago this year. They\u2019ve since returned to London with their kids, taking them to the spot by the lions where they first started talking. \u201cI was emotional when we were there together,\u201d says Cristina. It was a random meeting, spurred on by another random meeting \u2013 who knows what would have happened if Cristina\u2019s original airplane date had turned up that day. Although Cristina and Matt think fate played a role, looking back they\u2019re also proud that they worked to stay in touch, Cristina\u2019s proud of her spontaneity and determination, and Matt\u2019s proud of his willingness to take risks. \u201cLife is amazing,\u201d says Matt. \u201cIt is crazy just how absurd things can be. Be careful out there. You might find happiness in the strangest of places if you look at it right.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/stood-up-met-love-of-life-chance-encounters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_travel_australian-community-eats-crocodile-scli-intl", "text": "A remote Australian community has taken revenge on a massive saltwater crocodile by eating the 3.6-meter (11.8-foot) beast blamed for devouring pets and chasing children. On Wednesday, police in the town of Bulla in Australia\u2019s Northern Territory shot the crocodile after deeming it a \u201csignificant risk to the community.\u201d In a statement, Northern Territory Police said the predator \u201chad been stalking and lunging out of the water at children and adults\u201d and had \u201calso reportedly taken multiple community dogs.\u201d In a waste-conscious move, the crocodile was \u201cprepared for a feast in the traditional manner,\u201d police said, but not before authorities took the opportunity to give local children an impromptu \u201ccrocodile safety session,\u201d including an \u201cup-close look at the dangers within our waterways.\u201d Speaking to public broadcaster ABC, Northern Territory Police Sergeant Andrew McBride said the animal was \u201ccooked up into crocodile tail soup, he was on the barbecue, a few of the pieces were wrapped up in banana leaves and cooked underground.\u201d \u201cIt was a rather large traditional feast and there were a few full bellies,\u201d Sergeant McBride said. Both the saltwater and freshwater crocodile species are protected in Australia, where hunting the animals has been banned by federal law since 1971 \u2013 a time when poaching had driven them close to extinction. Numbers have boomed in the decades since, with the Northern Territory now home to some 100,000 crocodiles, according to the local government. Thousands more crocodiles are distributed across the north of neighbouring states Queensland and Western Australia. \u201cAny body of water in The Top End may contain large and potentially dangerous crocodiles,\u201d said government wildlife specialist Kristen Hay, using a colloquial name for the Northern Territory. The territory\u2019s website notes that saltwater crocodiles can grow to six meters (20 feet), weigh up to a ton and \u201cwill eat just about anything.\u201d That means interactions between crocodiles and humans can be fatal, and park rangers across northern Australia remove hundreds of saltwater crocodiles from populated areas each year. In April, a 16-year-old boy was killed by a crocodile in northern Queensland while attempting to swim to shore after his boat broke down. Last year, the remains of a 64-year-old fisherman were recovered from inside a crocodile, also in Queensland. A nine-year-old boy was lucky to survive a crocodile attack in the Northern Territory\u2019s Kakadu National Park in January, after being hospitalized with \u201cpuncture wounds.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/travel/australian-community-eats-crocodile-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "travel"}}
