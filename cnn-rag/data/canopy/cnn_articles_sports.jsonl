As his son tapped home to clinch his first PGA Tour title at the RBC Canadian Open on Sunday, Dougie MacIntyre \u2013 the head greenskeeper at Glencruitten Golf Club in Oban, Scotland \u2013 simultaneously became a PGA Tour-winning caddie. Having parachuted in his father to work the bag at the last minute, 27-year-old MacIntyre overcame a nervy start and a flock of chasing rivals to win by one stroke at Hamilton Golf and Country Club in Ontario. Just the fifth win by a Scotsman on the PGA Tour since 1940, and the first since Martin Laird in 2020, secured MacIntyre $1.69 million in prize money \u2013 the largest single event total ever claimed by a Scottish golfer and enough to fulfill the new champion\u2019s aims of paying off his parent\u2019s mortgage. Tears flowed freely for father and son as the duo soaked up the weight of the achievement on the 18th green. \u201cI\u2019m crying with joy, but I\u2019m laughing because I didn\u2019t think it was possible,\u201d MacIntyre, a first-time PGA Tour victor on his 45th start, told CBS Sports. \u201cI was going down the last and my dad\u2019s trying to tell me to stay focused and swing smooth because [on Saturday] I got a little bit too fast, but in my head, I wasn\u2019t listening to him \u2013 I was like, \u2018I want to win this for my dad.\u2019 \u201cThis is the guy who has taught me the game of golf and I just can\u2019t believe I have done this with him on the bag. This is just everything for me and family, my girlfriend, my team.\u201d Homesick Two-time European Tour winner MacIntyre had rotated through a string of caddies following triumph on his Ryder Cup debut last October, parting ways with most recent bagsman Scott Carmichael last week after missing the cut at the Charles Schwab Challenge. After the euphoria of victory with Team Europe in Rome, it had been a mixed start to 2024. Though there had been excellent performances, highlighted by a tied-eighth outing at the PGA Championship last month, MacIntyre missed the cut at seven events and had made no secret of his difficulties adapting to his first experience of full-time life on tour in the US. \u201cI was struggling,\u201d MacIntyre told reporters Sunday. \u201cMy girlfriend [and I], we just weren\u2019t enjoying the America Orlando lifestyle that we had thought would better my golf. \u201cIt just clears my mind, being back home. I get to spend time with the boys, a couple of beers with \u2018em, and they just treat me like Bob \u2026 I don\u2019t get treated as Bob MacIntyre the golfer, I get treated as Bob MacIntyre, one of the boys.\u201d A homesick MacIntyre had taken a trip back to Oban in April, picking up the clubs just twice across the three-week visit. After a string of requests for caddies fell through as he called around last Saturday, thoughts again turned to home and a long-time mantra: \u201cIf in doubt, call Dad.\u201d Naturally, MacIntyre senior \u2013 who will return to his greenkeeping duties with immediate effect \u2013 answered. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. I\u2019m a grasscutter not a caddie,\u201d 59-year-old MacIntyre, wiping away tears, added to CBS Sports. \u201cLast Saturday night, I\u2019m sitting on the couch at home and I\u2019m [thinking], \u2018Can I leave my job here? I\u2019m busy at work.\u2019 Eight o\u2019clock the next morning, I\u2019m on a flight out here and wow.\u201d \u2018You might not see Dad till next week!\u2019 After opening with a stellar six-under 64 on Thursday, MacIntyre had said he was trying to keep things simple to help an emergency caddie who \u2013 despite being \u201ca good golfer\u201d \u2013 was \u201cout of his depth\u201d on the bag at the game\u2019s highest level. Yet the unorthodox partnership continued to make short work of Hamilton Country Club, as MacIntyre \u2013 ranked 76th in the world heading into the tournament \u2013 soared into Sunday with a four-shot lead. That healthy cushion had been ripped apart just a few holes into the Scot\u2019s final round though, as Canadian home hero Mackenzie Hughes rattled home three quick birdies to capitalize on MacIntyre\u2019s opening bogey. A first PGA Tour win looked to be slipping away, but MacIntyre \u2013 steadied by his father\u2019s reassurances \u2013 responded brilliantly, fighting back with three swift birdies of his own and shrugging off a back-to-back bogey run after the turn to take a one-shot lead to the final tee. \u201cHe just kept telling me, \u2018We just stay in the fight\u2019 \u2026 He knows what to say and when to say it,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cHe thought that being here was a bit easier on his own mental health \u2026 [rather than] watching the scores on the app, but I don\u2019t think this week\u2019s done him great with the head because of the stress. \u201cBut he\u2019s the guy that\u2019s taught me the game of golf and he knows my game inside out. I can\u2019t thank him enough for this week.\u201d A steady par at the last hole was enough to see MacIntyre over the line ahead of American Ben Griffin at 16-under par overall, with South Korea\u2019s Tom Kim and world No. 3 Rory McIlroy among those within three shots of the victor. It lifts MacIntyre to a career-high world No. 39 position and stamps his ticket to the US Open at Pinehurst in North Carolina on June 13 \u2013 though plans for a first major chase will have to wait until some big-time celebrations have subsided. In a video call with his mother shared by the PGA Tour on X, formerly known as Twitter, MacIntyre warned her of the level of revelry expected to follow. \u201cYou might not see Dad till next week!\u201d he laughed.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/sport/robert-macintyre-father-caddie-canadian-open-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "sports"}}

{"id": "2024_05_10_sport_hattan-alsaif-mma-saudi-arabia-spt-intl", "text": "Hattan Alsaif has grown accustomed to sparring with men. Rarely shy about confronting heavier, stronger opponents, she knows what it\u2019s like to absorb blow after blow until tears begin to shine in her eyes, her face red and hot from crying. As one of the few women at her gym in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia \u2013 and the only woman hopeful of fighting at an elite level \u2013 Alsaif had little choice but to train with and against her male counterparts when she first took up martial arts. She credits her sometimes brutal introduction to the sport as one of the reasons for her success. \u201cI was the only girl doing it day and night, day and night, day and night,\u201d Alsaif told CNN Sport. \u201cI always spar with guys, I train with guys, I\u2019m always with the guys in the gym. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy thing, so when it comes to the cage, when I get a hit from a girl, I feel like, \u2018Whoa, is this all you\u2019ve got?\u2019\u201d The 22-year-old had already made history in MMA, even before her atomweight bout against Egypt\u2019s Nada Faheem on Friday, which she won by knock out in the second round. In January, Alsaif signed a contract with the Professional Fighters League (PFL), making her the first woman from Saudi Arabia to join a global MMA promotion. It was a notable moment in a country known for its socially conservative attitudes, where sporting opportunities have historically been limited for women. The Saudi women\u2019s soccer team only played its first match two years ago, while a domestic soccer league wasn\u2019t established until 2020. Alsaif is acutely aware of her status as a trailblazer for female MMA fighters in Saudi Arabia and takes such a responsibility seriously. \u201cIt\u2019s big, to be honest, because I\u2019m going to be carrying this thing my entire life,\u201d she said, speaking to CNN before her MMA debut fight on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit heavy to carry it, but I\u2019m excited and proud to be the person to do it.\u201d Alsaif endured a difficult upbringing, orphaned at the age of 10 after both of her parents died in a short space of time. She says she battled depression during her teenage years before finding solace in martial arts, helping her to discover a sense of purpose and peace. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a normal childhood or an easy childhood because of the loss of my parents,\u201d said Alsaif. \u201cBut after God, martial arts helped me a lot \u2013 so, so, so much. It changed my life 100% for the better. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m so addicted to martial arts. I don\u2019t want to stop doing [it] because it\u2019s just the thing that makes me feel alive. I feel I\u2019m alive when I train, when I fight, in the gym \u2013 I can feel my soul alive. \u201cWhen I breathe after the rounds, when I feel sick, when I feel tired, when I feel courage, when I feel scared, those moments, every part of that, it makes me feel alive. It\u2019s something that means a lot to me.\u201d Growing up, Alsaif had always loved extreme, adrenaline-fueled sports, and her curiosity to try something new took her to a boxing gym in her local neighborhood. That piqued her interest, but she soon found that the boxing class she was attending lacked rigor and professionalism. Then, after seeing videos of Saudi MMA fighter Abdullah Al-Qahtani on social media, the pair exchanged messages and Alsaif was invited to try the sport for herself. \u201cI started looking at the guys, and they were hitting the bags with kicks and elbows and knees,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI was like, they have more weapons than I do. I only have hands [in boxing]. I felt so jealous \u2026 I love to do the things that have more power.\u201d Alsaif started to compete in Muay Thai \u2013 the stand-up, striking combat sport originating in Thailand \u2013 and went on to win titles at the World Combat Games, the Saudi Games and the International Federation of Muaythai Associations (IFMA) World Championships under the guidance of coach Feras Sadaa. Sadaa, coach of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Muay Thai national team, has been central to Alsaif\u2019s success, though his influence extends far beyond a sporting sphere. \u201cAll these years, I never felt what [having a] father means at all,\u201d said Alsaif. \u201cAnd he was a gift from God. He did everything with me. He helped me in every situation, in the gym or outside of the gym. \u201cHe was like family. He always told anyone else that Hattan is not just my student, Hattan is one of my kids \u2026 I wish to make him so happy [and] represent him in the best way I can.\u201d Friday\u2019s fight card in Riyadh, headlined by Al-Qahtani, was Alsaif\u2019s first chance to assess whether she was able to translate her Muay Thai prowess into success in an MMA cage. The event, part of the PFL\u2019s growing prominence in the region, featured fighters from across the Middle East and North Africa, less than three months since Claressa Shields and Kelsey De Santis contested the first professional female MMA bout in Saudi Arabia. Last year, SURJ Sports Investments Company, which is owned by Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF), acquired a minority stake in the PFL, part of the PFL\u2019s strategy to recruit more fighters and attract more fans in the MENA region. Alsaif never envisioned herself becoming an MMA pioneer when she took her first curious steps into a combat gym, but said that she wants to leave a legacy in the sport. Her upcoming bout is the first step towards achieving that goal and also an opportunity to reflect on all that she has overcome during her short time as an MMA fighter. She does that between rounds in the gym, wiping any tears from her eyes and reminding herself of the effort and energy she has so far devoted to her pursuit. \u201cI start looking at myself in the mirror and I\u2019d be like, \u2018You have killed yourself; you have cried; you have sacrificed everything,\u2019\u201d said Alsaif. \u201c\u2018You are really strong; you are your own role model\u2019 \u2026 It does give me a lot of motivation.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/sport/hattan-alsaif-mma-saudi-arabia-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_sport_paris-olympics-diabetes-tech-spt-intl", "text": "Olympians, including Dutch marathon runner Abdi Nageeye, are using a new tool they hope will boost their medal chances this summer: tiny monitors that attach to the skin to track blood glucose levels. Continuous glucose monitors, or CGMs, were developed for use by diabetes patients but their makers, led by Abbott (ABT.N) and Dexcom (DXCM.O), also spy opportunities in sports and wellness. The Paris Olympics, which start on July 26, are an opportunity to showcase the technology \u2013 even though there is as yet no proof it can boost athletic performance. \u201cI do see a day where CGM is certainly going to be used outside of diabetes in a big way,\u201d said Dexcom\u2019s Chief Operating Officer Jacob Leach. Diabetes patients remain the CGM specialist\u2019s commercial focus, he told Reuters, but Dexcom is also working with researchers on future use to optimize athletic performance. He would not disclose details. The CGM market is already worth billions of dollars thanks to demand from diabetes patients, who use the coin-sized adhesive skin patches with a Bluetooth link to a smartphone instead of drawing blood through a finger stick. The readings help determine whether they need an insulin dose. In March, Dexcom\u2019s\u00a0Stelo\u00a0device, targeting people with early-stage diabetes who are not on insulin, became the first CGM to win US approval for purchase without a prescription. Launch is planned for this summer. Abbott introduced a CGM product for amateur and elite sports users without diabetes in Europe as early as 2020 and has sponsored Kenyan marathon great Eliud Kipchoge and his team since 2021. Top athletes and their support staff have been using CGMs to optimize calorie intake and workout intensity as they prepare for sport events. Abbott said it is targeting the non-diabetic consumer market. It is eyeing a US launch for its Lingo device and smartphone app for health and wellbeing, available in Britain since January at a\u00a0cost\u00a0of 120-150 pounds ($152-$190) per month. Sales of Abbott\u2019s FreeStyle Libre range, the most commonly used CGMs, rose 23% to $5.3 billion in 2023 on demand from diabetes patients who value their ease of use and monitoring precision. Dexcom saw 2023 revenue grow 24% to $3.6 billion. Research firm GlobalData forecasts the lifestyle CGM market could grow nearly 15% a year to reach $9.9 billion by 2031, partly driven by users of weight-loss drugs like Wegovy who seek med-tech gadgets to support dieting efforts. Other market researchers estimate the overall CGM market including diabetic use, with suppliers like\u00a0Medtronic (MDT.N), will grow 9-10% annually over five years. Preparing for Paris Dutch marathoner Nageeye, who won silver at the Tokyo Olympics, said he and his coaches are monitoring blood glucose as an indicator of the body\u2019s available energy, part of his quest for an \u201ceffortless run.\u201d CGM use has guided Nageeye, who has qualified for Paris, to work on sleeping and eating patterns so that he expends a minimum of energy during training. \u201cThat\u2019s your energy, actually, that\u2019s your fuel. We have to monitor that,\u201d said Nageeye. His team has been\u00a0sponsored\u00a0by Abbott since April 2021. Australian swimmer Chelsea Hodges, who won relay gold at the Tokyo Olympics, said CGMs had helped her remedy bouts of extreme exhaustion and dizziness during endurance training by making adjustments to her calorie intake and training times. She spoke to Reuters while preparing for Paris, but recently ended her swimming career due to hip problems. While companies see growth potential in the gadgets, sports nutrition scientists see a promising field of research. \u201cA big guesswork for endurance athletes has always been: \u2018Am I training hard enough or am I training too hard?\u2019 It seems with CGMs, we have a better understanding,\u201d said Associate Professor Filip Larsen of the Swedish School of Sport and Health Sciences. Larsen, also chief science officer of sports performance consultancy firm\u00a0svexa, said the firm has been analyzing CGM data collected by several athletes and teams. He said svexa is not sponsored by any CGM maker. Larsen warned, however, that there was little validated science yet on how to optimize an athlete\u2019s routines using CGMs. \u201cMost researchers cannot give you the exact answers. In five years, we will know 10 times as much as we do now.\u201d But the field is abuzz with trials and experiments, including work on glucose-measuring contact lenses. Sports dietician Greg Cox, associate professor at Australia\u2019s Bond University, has worked with swimmers \u2013 including Hodges \u2013 and rowers, triathletes and track athletes. Results of a trial\u00a0run by his team to test how not eating enough calories to sustain the intensity of exercise would affect endurance athletes\u2019 glucose readings have so far been inconclusive, and he said more research into CGMs was needed. Both Cox and Larsen expressed scepticism about non-diabetic consumers using the technology for health and fitness without professional advice. \u201cWhat I see on social media is that normal, healthy people get scared when they had one banana and their blood glucose goes up really high for one hour. This is completely expected and a normal response,\u201d said Larsen. Market leader Abbott told Reuters that understanding blood-glucose swings is key to managing one\u2019s metabolism for a healthier life. \u201cWhile glucose spikes are normal in healthy people, we also know that having fewer frequent and large spikes and crashes in glucose is associated with improved energy, mood, focus, sleep, and reduces cravings,\u201d a spokesperson said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/sport/paris-olympics-diabetes-tech-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_sport_individual-neutral-athlete-olympics-explainer-spt-intl", "text": "Russian athletes have competed under several different guises throughout the 128-year history of the Olympics, and they will be known by another new name at Paris 2024. Following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine \u2013 supported by Belarus \u2013 in February 2022, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes should be prohibited from competing in international sporting events. In January 2023, the IOC announced its intention to allow these athletes to compete as neutrals, in a similar way to how Russian and Belarusian tennis players are presented at ATP, WTA and Grand Slam events without any reference to their nationality. The Russian Olympic Committee was then suspended entirely by the IOC in October 2023 when it absorbed Ukrainian regional sports organizations in Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia. There has been much debate around whether Russian and Belarusian athletes should be permitted to take part in the Olympics, with Ukrainian athletes in particular voicing their concerns. However, the IOC Executive Board ruled that it would be unfair to punish athletes based on their passports alone, thereby allowing some to compete in Paris, albeit under very strict conditions. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes at the 2024 Olympics. \u2018No flag, anthem, colors\u2019 An Individual Neutral Athlete is the name used to refer to athletes with either a Russian or Belarusian passport who will be competing at this year\u2019s Games in July and August. These athletes are referred to by the abbreviation AIN, which comes from the French translation Athl\u00e8tes Individuels Neutres. These athletes will be permitted to compete if they meet eligibility requirements. No reference to either country will be made at the Games through the athletes\u2019 participation. \u201cThe sanctions against those responsible for the war, the Russian and Belarusian states and governments, remain in place for the Olympic Games Paris 2024,\u201d the IOC said in a statement. \u201cNo flag, anthem, colors or any other identifications whatsoever of Russia or Belarus will be displayed at the Olympic Games Paris 2024 in any official venue or any official function,\u201d the statement continues. Competition gear for the AINs has not yet been revealed, so it is unclear whether it will bear the turquoise colors of the brand-new flag of the AINs, or that they will don basic sportswear. An anthem \u2013 without lyrics \u2013 has also been commissioned for use in medal ceremonies. Though AINs are eligible to compete and win Olympic medals, they will not be displayed in the medal table of nations. AINs will also be excluded from the parade of delegations at the Opening Ceremony on the basis that they are individual athletes rather than a team, though the IOC has said \u201can opportunity will be provided for them to experience the event.\u201d Individual Neutral Athlete Eligibility Review Panel In December 2023, the Executive Board of the IOC decided that Russian and Belarusian athletes who qualified through the existing qualification systems of international federations would have to meet strict requirements if they are to be selected as an AIN. There will be no Russian or Belarusian representation in team events, with participation limited to individual competition. Per the IOC, athletes who actively support the war or who are contracted to the Russian or Belarusian military or national security agencies will not be eligible to be entered or to compete. The same stipulation applies to support personnel. Like all other athletes, AINs will need to meet anti-doping requirements to be considered for selection. The eligibility of these athletes will be determined by the newly established Individual Neutral Athlete Eligibility Review Panel. Two-time NBA champion and six-time All-Star Pau Gasol is part of the panel, representing the IOC Ethics Commission. The Spaniard will sit alongside IOC Vice-President and former artistic swimmer Nicole Hoevertsz, and former Olympic table tennis gold medalist Ryu Seung-min, who will be representing the Athletes\u2019 Commission. International sporting federations will need to submit their lists of qualified athletes to panel for review. At the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo (postponed to 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic) and the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, Russian athletes competed under the name of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) \u00a0as a result of the country\u2019s state-sponsored doping program. Athletes could compete under the ROC banner if they could prove that they were not connected to the scandal. However, with the ROC bearing both the name and colors of Russia \u2013 as well as the subsequent suspension of the ROC in October \u2013 it was no longer a viable option for Russian athletes to compete under this name in Paris. It is also important to note that the ROC was not a neutral body, rather a delegation of Russian athletes which technically didn\u2019t compete on the behalf of Russia, but retained a right to represent the country in all but an official capacity. Numbers of AINs at the Paris Olympics The IOC stated that, as of March 28, 12 AINs with a Russian passport and seven AINs with a Belarusian passport have qualified for Paris 2024 but said that the final number of athletes who will actually compete at the Games would not be communicated until the selection process has been finalized. \u201cThe maximum number, which is unlikely to be reached, would be 55 and 28 respectively,\u201d the IOC told CNN. In comparison, Russia sent 330 athletes to Tokyo in 2021 while Belarus sent 104. There is also the matter of whether Moscow will actually accept the conditions laid out by the IOC. Russia is planning to host its own \u201cFriendship Games\u201d later in the year, an event which has been condemned by the IOC. The identity of the athletes is also yet to be revealed, but it is possible that Russian former world No. 1 tennis player Daniil Medvedev will be part of the field. The former US Open champion said that he would be happy to participate as a neutral. \u201cI decided for myself that whenever I can play the Olympics, I want to be there I want to represent what I can represent,\u201d he told reporters last month. \u201cIf it\u2019s not under the flag, I know who I am, I know why I play tennis and I played like this all my life. Russia has competed under a neutral banner on two previous occasions. The ROC was suspended in 2017 as a result of the doping scandal ahead of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea the following year, but selected Russian athletes who met pre-competition conditions were still given the opportunity to compete as \u201cOlympic Athletes from Russia\u201d and were represented by the Olympic flag. Russia and Belarus were also part of the \u201cUnified Team\u201d at the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona after the dissolution of the Soviet Union the previous year. The delegation was made up of former Soviet republics \u2013 aside from the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia \u2013 which had elected to compete as one unit. The Unified Team also bore the Olympic flag but winners were honored under the flags of their own nations.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/sport/individual-neutral-athlete-olympics-explainer-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2023_02_05_sport_head-injury-suicide-female-athletes-intl-spt-cmd", "text": "Kelly Catlin and Ellie Soutter never met, but they had a lot in common.  Both were commanding athletes: Catlin, a US track cyclist, was a three-times world champion and Olympic silver medalist, and Soutter, a snowboarder, was tipped to be one of Team Great Britain\u2019s strongest contenders for the 2022 Winter Olympics, having already won a bronze medal at the 2017 European Youth Olympic Festival.  Both were incredibly smart \u2013 Catlin was studying for a master\u2019s degree in computational and mathematical engineering at Stanford University, while Soutter learned to speak French in about six months, according to her father.   At times they almost seemed superhuman. In 2013, after only three weeks of formal training and having broken her wrist, Soutter became British Champion with her arm in a cast. Meanwhile, Catlin, who had a tenderness for children, once rode 80 miles through sleet and snow to speak to a grade school about her Olympic experience.    Yet these two women\u2019s lives were tragically cut short after they sustained serious head injuries in their pursuit of sporting greatness and then took their own lives. Catlin was 23, while Soutter died by suicide on her 18th birthday.  Females may be more susceptible to concussion, and they also have worse and prolonged symptoms after their injury than men, according to a review of 25 studies of sport-related concussion published in the Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine.  However, women remain significantly underrepresented within sport and exercise science research. This, leading experts warn, means they often do not get the treatment or aftercare they need following a head injury.  Women\u2019s sports have historically not received the same attention or funding as men\u2019s sports, Dr. Ann McKee, Director of the Boston University Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s been shown that women athletes are more likely to get a concussion, they tend to have longer recovery periods,\u201d McKee added. \u201cWe do not have enough information about what happens in the female brain. We don\u2019t know if women are biologically more susceptible to these injuries,\u201d she said, adding that some research suggests the size and musculature of women\u2019s necks could play a part. Kelly  Before becoming a track cyclist, Catlin, a triplet, was a national champion road cyclist and time trial national champion, her father Mark, told CNN. After winning a Canadian international race at 17 she was invited to an Olympic training camp for a try out, where, impressed by her performance numbers, coaches immediately offered her a position on the track pursuit team.  Catlin\u2019s father, Mark, told CNN, that his daughter was \u201cintense\u201d and \u201cambitious,\u201d attributes she channeled into her sporting life. Her life changed irrevocably in January 2019. Practicing fast downhill descents in the hills near Los Angeles, she crashed and went skidding down the road.  Despite suffering road rash, Catlin got back on her bike, and finished the ride. It wasn\u2019t her first crash \u2013 she had experienced 4 or 5 hard crashes before this, her father said, and after the latest, she didn\u2019t have any symptoms at the time.  But soon after, at a World Cup track event in Berlin, Catlin was gripped by a sudden and severe headache.   \u201cShe couldn\u2019t compete,\u201d her father said. \u201cKelly is kind of this stoical individual. And if she\u2019s rolling around on the ground, clutching her head, it has to be a severe thing.\u201d On closer inspection, Catlin\u2019s helmet from LA had dents in it. Her father told CNN that this, coupled with her symptoms, caused her family to become aware she had suffered a concussion, which was later confirmed with a diagnosis from Stanford\u2019s Health Centre.  A concussion is a brain injury which happens after a hit to the head or body causes the brain to move back and forth inside the skull, according to the CDC. When Catlin returned to the US, her father says she was examined by the track training center in Colorado. It was confirmed she suffered a concussion, and a return to training protocol was advised, but not implemented or communicated to her coach, he said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any follow-up from Colorado after this. I believe they assumed she would seek care at Stanford,\u201d he told CNN.  CNN has reached out to Stanford and USA Cycling for comment.  Catlin\u2019s symptoms didn\u2019t improve, and in weekly phone calls with her parents, she admitted she was struggling with schoolwork and was unable to concentrate. Stanford Health Center, having diagnosed Catlin with concussion with ongoing symptoms, recommended that she decrease her training for 2 weeks and then gradually build back up and start sessions with an athletic trainer, medical documents sent to CNN by her father show. She was referred to a concussion specialist, the document adds. She tried to train, but \u201cshe would have to stop because she got a severe headache just from walking,\u201d according to her father. Her heart rate would also accelerate rapidly from even the smallest exertion, leaving her with \u201cno exercise tolerance whatsoever,\u201d he added.  Her injury had other consequences. \u201cAs far as we knew she was never a person that suffered from depression. She had an interesting sense of humor.  She was always upbeat and bubbly about things,\u201d her father told CNN.  \u201cShe basically thought her life was over. She was no longer able to be the athlete that she was, she was failing her teammates. And she wasn\u2019t able to succeed in school now. And I think ultimately, that\u2019s why she took her life, because she thought her life was over,\u201d he added.  At the end of January, Catlin made a serious but non-fatal suicide attempt, and was involuntarily admitted to the locked psychiatric ward at Stanford, her father told CNN. A month after that attempt, she took her own life.     Ellie   Soutter\u2019s father Tony said there were many dimensions to his young daughter \u2013 not only was she an \u201cadrenaline junkie,\u201d but she was \u201cvery conscientious\u201d and excelled in school, even after moving from England to France.   Aged 12, Soutter took up snowboarding at school \u2013 and just months later, she was spotted in her hometown resort of Les Gets and trialed by Team Great Britain in February 2013.  \u201cIt was quite obvious why she kept winning competitions because she just made it easy,\u201d her father said. \u201cShe just made it look graceful and beautiful.\u201d But training took its toll \u2013 Soutter told CNN that his daughter suffered seven major concussions in five years, between 2013 and 2018.  \u201cI was being advised by doctors \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, she\u2019s young enough she\u2019ll bounce back. As she progressed, becoming an elite athlete starting on the World Cup circuit, every time she had another concussion, they got worse, and they took longer to recover from,\u201d he told CNN.     \u201cWith every concussion, with the exception of a few minor knocks, Ellie saw a doctor in person,\u201d he added. \u201cI was always told that she was young enough to bounce back to full health after each case and therefore never consulted with the doctors that I met, about any previous concussions.\u201d But Soutter\u2019s final concussion was so \u201chuge\u201d that she spent two nights in the hospital. \u201cWhen I got there, she didn\u2019t even know who I was or where she was,\u201d her father said. Soutter was then selected for the Junior Snowboard World Championships in New Zealand August 2018.  But a month before the competition, she died by suicide.  Her father said a neurologist conducted a CT scan of her brain and reaction tests three months after her final concussion, but said she was \u201cabsolutely fine\u201d and could continue competing.                                                                                                                                 Like Catlin, Soutter had issues with studying and concentrating, becoming more insular as she suffered from crippling headaches. She also started suffering from insomnia.  \u201cShe would literally sit with the tutor a good month after a concussion, and suddenly, she\u2019d go blind. She\u2019d not be able to see \u2013 everything would go black and dark,\u201d her father said. After missing a flight to snowboard training, Soutter died by suicide on her 18th birthday. Team GB referred CNN to GB Snowsport when approached for comment, adding that Ellie only competed for Team GB at one event.  In order to represent Britain in international competitions, GB Snowsport says athletes or their coaches are required to demonstrate that the athlete has reached established performance criteria, is of the relevant technical ability to compete, and has appropriate medical clearance to compete. A large number of athletes can represent Britain at different levels of international competition but are not part of a programme delivered and overseen by GB Snowsport.  \u201cAs Ellie was not part of the GB Snowsport programme, we were unable to implement a personalised recovery and management programme for Ellie,\u201d a spokesperson for GB Snowsport told CNN in an email. \u201cShe was, however, covered by national policies and protocols around fitness to compete, and would not have been cleared for any activity \u2013 training or competition \u2013 overseen by GB Snowsport without being able to demonstrate appropriate medical sign-off,\u201d they added. The spokesperson for GB Snowsport told CNN: \u201cWe take concussions and head injuries incredibly seriously, and in reviewing contemporaneous records from the time that Ellie was involved in snowsport we are confident that GB Snowsport staff applied and followed every appropriate process.\u201d Catlin and Soutter aren\u2019t the only young sporting women whose lives have been cut short in this way. After 29-year-old Australian rules football player Jacinda Barclay took her life in 2020, post-mortem research by scientists found that she had degradation to her cerebral white matter unusual for someone her age.  \u201cFor someone her age, you would expect to see lovely pristine white matter, and hers looked like she was an old woman in that it was basically degraded,\u201d Michael Buckland, founder and Executive Director of the Australian Sports Brain Bank, who studied Barclay\u2019s brain, told CNN.  \u201cWe haven\u2019t gone back and done specific white matter studies on our donors,\u201d he told CNN, adding that the bank hasn\u2019t done peer reviewed research on this.  \u201cBut what struck me, just as someone that sees a lot of brains \u2013 this is not normal for someone of that age.\u201d  Damage to white matter has been associated with dementia, according to research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.   Opportunities missed Suicide after concussion is rare. However patients diagnosed with concussion or mild traumatic brain injury had double the risk of suicide and a higher risk of suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts than people without brain injuries, a 2018 study from researchers at the University of Harvard published in JAMA Neurology found. Dr. Robert Cantu, clinical professor of neurology at the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at Boston University School of Medicine told CNN that there are several theories as to why incidence of suicide is higher in people who have suffered concussion. One theory, he explained, is that those suffering from persistent post-concussion symptoms may have structural or functional brain damage and could be experiencing \u201cbehavioral dysregulation: short fuse, irritability, [and] can\u2019t suppress impulses the way you normally could.\u201d   With these emotional problems, \u201cthey would be more prone to perhaps do something impulsive, like commit suicide,\u201d Cantu, medical director of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, told CNN. A second theory, Cantu noted, is that post-concussive symptoms prevent people from getting back into their sport and stop them \u201cfrom being the person that they were before their injury.\u201d Neither theory is proven to the exclusion of the other, Cantu said, adding he thinks increased suicidality was \u201ca combined factor involving both in many, if not most cases.\u201d There are also differences in the way brain injuries affect women.  A study of female soccer players across US high schools found they are nearly twice as likely to suffer concussion as their male counterparts, according to research that looked at over 80,000 adolescent athletes, published in the journal JAMA Network Open.  Women remain significantly underrepresented within sport and exercise science research: a 2021 study examining papers from some of the most influential sports medical journals found that only 6% of the studies were solely focused on women, compared with 31% of studies that included just men. Other researchers have pointed to female sex hormones, with risk of concussion changing with hormone levels during a menstrual cycle.  McKee said all athletes can also experience \u201cnon-concussive\u201d injuries: \u201chits to the head that can be of the same magnitude as concussion, but they don\u2019t rise to the level of symptoms for whatever reason, so a player tends to play right through it.\u201d Cumulative exposure to repetitive head impacts \u2013 including concussion and non- concussive injuries \u2013 increases the risk for the neurodegenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known as CTE, McKee said.  The disease, which can only be formally diagnosed with an autopsy, has mostly been seen in either veterans or people who played contact sports, particularly American football, say researchers. The disease occurs when the brain starts to degenerate likely due to repeated head traumas, according to the Mayo Clinic, which notes CTE is \u201cassociated with recurrent concussions.\u201d But scientists aren\u2019t only concerned about concussions.  Previous studies have shown subconcussive head impacts \u2013 repetitive hits to the head and body that do not cause symptoms \u2013 can still result in long-term neurological disease.   According to The Concussion Legacy Foundation, \u201cthe best available evidence suggests that subconcussive impacts, not concussions, are the driving force behind CTE.\u201d There have been cases of CTE discovered in athletes who have never been diagnosed with a concussion, according to the Concussion Legacy Foundation. And other changes in the brain after repetitive head impacts aside from CTE are likely \u201cequally important,\u201d McKee said. \u201cWe also see damage to the white matter. And that appears to be mostly in the frontal lobe, but also in the temporal lobes,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to understand the relationship of those white matter changes to behavioral and mood symptoms, perhaps even suicidality,\u201d she said.  McKee stressed that concussion management is important, but physicians and athletes should also be aware of other injuries. \u201cThe problem is the subclinical hits \u2013 the non-concussive injuries that aren\u2019t detected, you don\u2019t pull the player off the field \u2013 and they can be in the hundreds or even the 1000s in a single season,\u201d she explained. Lack of research  Though a growing body of data suggests women in sport are more likely to sustain a concussion, have more severe symptoms, and to take longer to recover, most sports-related concussions protocols are based on data from men.  In a review in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers looked at 171 concussion studies written since 1967 which are used to inform the most influential consensus and position statements in treating sports-related concussions. Clinicians rely on these documents to guide their medical practice when treating athletes \u2013 but most of the studies are focused on men. Only 1% of them was looking exclusively at concussions in women and 40% of them didn\u2019t have any women in a sample of participants at all.   There is another risk factor for women in sport when they sustain head injuries, Katherine Snedaker, founder and executive director of PINK Concussions, a non-profit dedicated to women\u2019s health and brain injury, told CNN.  There is a gulf of millions of dollars separating women and men when it comes to average annual salaries in most professional sports. Outside of elite sport, Snedaker says, female athletes often don\u2019t have access to the same medical care as men, meaning head injuries aren\u2019t spotted as routinely.   \u201cThey tend to push really hard through the injury,\u201d she said. And many women can\u2019t afford to take time out to recover: even professional athletes will supplement their sports income with other jobs, she added, and many are caregivers. \u201cWhen they really crater, it\u2019s a couple of days or weeks later.\u201d  Snedaker said female athletes often weren\u2019t aware they had suffered a head injury. If they were, she said, there were no appropriate medical or sporting staff to inform. Not enough support The families of Catlin and Soutter feel the young women didn\u2019t get enough support after their injuries. After Catlin\u2019s first suicide attempt, she was released from an involuntary admission to the psychiatric ward after threatening legal action, and a conference between psychiatrists, her coach and her parents.  She attended therapy sessions, which she agreed to attend during the conference, but found \u201cthey were geared toward suicidal freshman with a whole set of different issues than an elite Olympic athlete,\u201d her father told CNN. She got a referral to a sports psychologist that worked with the Stanford athletic department, but the department forbade the psychologist from seeing Catlin because she was not a varsity athlete, her father added.  She contacted the office of a sports psychologist with whom she had developed a rapport while in the hospital \u2013 but, his appointment secretary said he had no openings for six months, her father told CNN.  \u201cWherever she turned she could not find help,\u201d he said, adding that his daughter tried a suicide hotline several times: she was once put on hold and once received no answer. Catlin described his daughter as a \u201cstoic, female warrior type person that isn\u2019t going to admit that she\u2019s struggling.\u201d  \u201cShe needed a sports psychiatrist that really could understand what she was going through and understand the rigors of her life in terms of preparation for competitions and the athletic side of it and what it could potentially do to you.\u201d Her father said a major factor in his daughter\u2019s death was \u201ca lack of communication between the facilities that were involved in Kelly\u2019s care. No one was in charge and they assumed the other institutions were following up when they weren\u2019t,\u201d he added. In a statement sent to CNN, Luisa Rapport, director of emergency communications and media relations at Stanford University did not address any of the specific allegations made by Catlin\u2019s family.  She said while the university does not discuss in the media the details of individual students\u2019 experiences, \u201csupporting the mental and emotional health of students is a critical priority for Stanford.\u201d  \u201cStudents in need of mental health crisis assistance \u2013 including students having suicidal thoughts \u2013 and those who are concerned about students in need of assistance, can contact the University\u2019s Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) 24 hours-a-day, seven days-a-week,\u201d she added. Rapport said that in addition to this, \u201cthere are multiple places where psychological services may be provided for students depending on individualized need and treatment recommendations, including, for example, affiliated hospital services and clinics through Stanford\u2019s Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, and mental health programs and clinicians in the community.\u201d In a statement sent to CNN, USA Cycling said it was \u201cdevastated\u201d by Catlin\u2019s death, adding: \u201cShe brought focus and determination to everything she did, and served as an inspiration to everyone who knew her.  \u201cAs the National Governing Body for the sport of cycling, USA Cycling prioritizes the holistic wellbeing of the riders on the U.S. National Team and has a longstanding commitment to providing both physical and mental health resources to members of the team,\u201d a representative for USA Cycling added.   After his daughter Ellie\u2019s death, Soutter was contacted by the UNITE Brain Bank, who wanted to study her brain as part of their research into CTE. But even in that facility \u2013 the biggest of its kind in the world \u2013 of some 1,300 brains, only 3% belonged to women, Ann McKee, Director of the Boston University Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center told CNN. \u201cWhen I actually started looking into CTE \u2013 all of the work that they\u2019ve done with the footballers in America, she had every single symptom and more,\u201d Soutter told CNN. \u201cIt was quite obvious to me that there was a definite link in her starting to get into dark places and feeling bad and anxious and not sleeping properly. All of those symptoms \u2026 Every one that\u2019s involved in CTE was part of Ellie\u2019s life,\u201d he added. \u201cI truly believe today that my daughter would be alive had I had any inkling, you know, even the smallest bit of information.\u201d Editor\u2019s Note: If you are in the US and you or a loved one have contemplated suicide, call The National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255) to connect with a trained counselor.

{"id": "2024_06_08_sport_cricket-united-states-changing-world", "text": "Call it the Miracle on Grass. A national cricket team that most Americans didn\u2019t even know they had beat one of the sport\u2019s global powers Pakistan, for whom the game is a national obsession. The triumph Thursday in the T20 World Cup \u2013 a global tournament using a shortened, three-hour version of a game that can last five days and still end in a draw \u2013 shocked the cricketing world. Cricket briefly flickered into US consciousness as the result popped up on news sites in a rare moment for a sport that lives in obscurity in the United States outside the South Asian and Caribbean communities. \u201cBeating Pakistan in the World Cup is going to open many doors for us,\u201d said USA Cricket captain Monank Patel in Texas, where the game took place in a converted minor league baseball park. Corey Anderson, who represented New Zealand internationally and now plays for the US team, told CNN he got hundreds of text messages after the win. \u201cIt\u2019s probably shocked the cricketing world,\u201d said the 33-year-old who has an American wife and kids. \u201cI know definitely here in the US it\u2019s been a lot of media coverage, which is fantastic. I think USA Cricket is just not that well known within America, and I think we put ourselves a little bit more on the map.\u201d Cricket faces huge barriers to becoming anything more than a curiosity to most Americans. But the US victory over Pakistan is exactly what global cricket chiefs hoped for when bringing some of this year\u2019s T20 World Cup to the United States, which is co-hosting along with islands in the Caribbean, a more traditional hotbed of the game that has faced challenges from the encroachment of US sports. In the biggest game ever on US soil, more than 30,000 fans will Sunday pack into towering bleachers in a temporary stadium that materialized out of nowhere in a Long Island, New York, park to watch India play Pakistan. Tickets are selling for $700 on the secondary market. The global TV audience could at least double the 124 million who tuned into the Super Bowl this year. Peter Della Penna, an American journalist and broadcaster who covers cricket in this country after falling for the game during a college exchange stint in Australia, was stunned when he saw the new infrastructure on Long Island. \u201cThey had a recreational cricket field, but it was basically just a community park,\u201d he said. \u201cTo see what was there when I got there was quite extraordinary. Talking to the residents and the community, they are taken aback.\u201d America\u2019s most famous cricket victory on Thursday tells a story about the changing demographic mix in the United States. Cricket\u2019s new Field of Dreams in Nassau County is testimony to a dynamic and highly educated South Asian community that is becoming increasingly prosperous and connected in US business and society and politically more important. It\u2019s no coincidence that former President Donald Trump appeared alongside Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi before around 100,000 people at a rally at the world\u2019s largest cricket stadium in Ahmedabad in 2020. He wanted to woo a slice of the electorate back home. \u201cThe diaspora is sizable, and they clearly have connections to\u00a0(India) \u2026 the most populous nation in the world,\u201d said Simon Chadwick, a professor specializing in the geopolitical economy of sport at SKEMA, a global business school. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a large diaspora, a large country. You\u2019ve got a sport that has proved to be commercially incredibly successful. You got have investors, not just from the United States or from the Gulf region, hungry for potential commercial opportunities and willing to take a punt.\u201d How cricket mirrors a revolution in global sports The T20 World Cup games in the United States also reflect one of the most dynamic new realities in the multi-billion-dollar market of global sports. This is the shift in power away from traditional sports administrators and marketplaces like the United Kingdom and Europe to rising countries in the Middle East and South Asia. Cricket was spread around the globe by colonialists at a time when the sun never used to set on the British Empire. It\u2019s still most popular in nations the British used to rule, like India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, South Africa, \ufeffNew Zealand and Australia. Its premier international contest is the Ashes, a series of five-day contests that span the summer between England and Australia that date back to 1877 and take place twice every four years, once in each nation. But the balance of power in cricket has now shifted to India because of its massive television market and the emerging middle class in a nation with a billion people. The Indian Premier League, an annual short-form tournament that draws the world\u2019s top players with huge salaries, is transforming the game in a way that alienates many traditionalists and has spawned a series of spin-off franchise leagues \u2014 including the fledging Major League Cricket in the US that debuted last year with games in Texas and North Carolina. Indian cricketers, especially the batting legend Virat Kohli, are megastars back home and the strong viewership of the IPL among US fans built a rationale to bring World Cup games to America. The transformation of cricket parallels the growing power of soccer\u2019s new elites like the United Arab Emirates, which is the majority owner of Manchester City, and Qatar, which bankrolls Paris Saint-Germain. Middle Eastern money has flowed into Formula One, which \u2013 like cricket \u2013 is expanding in the US. Saudi Arabia is behind a split in professional golf after buying up top players with its LIV golf league. Cricket will become an Olympic sport in Los Angeles in 2028 partly because Modi, a just reelected Hindu nationalist, leveraged India\u2019s growing international clout to get it included. The internationalization of sports finance is not universally welcome. Some critics dismiss investments by Middle Eastern nations and events like the FIFA World Cup in Qatar or the Beijing Olympics as \u201csports washing\u201d \u2014 a way for authoritarian nations to clean up their images abroad. But it also reflects how developing nations are changing world\u2019s balance of economic and political power and, in some cases, are eclipsing their former colonial rulers. \u201cThere is this pivot from global north to global south,\u201d said Chadwick. \u201cAnd this pivot is evident not just in cricket or sports, but obviously in economic and political affairs, generally.\u201d What is cricket? Cricket is a game of bat-and-ball with distant similarities to baseball. Batters stand before a wicket \u2013 three vertical wooden poles stuck in the ground at either end of a strip of tightly mown grass called a pitch \u2013 that is a bit like a strike zone. Bowlers, who can reach speeds of 90 mph or more \u2013 and slower specialists called spinners who exert revolutions on the hard cricket ball with a flick of the wrist or a snap of the fingers \u2013 deliver the ball with a straight arm hurl. The ball must bounce on the pitch before it reaches the batter, allowing skilled bowlers to create deviations off a surface that becomes more receptive as it gets scuffed up. Runs are scored by batters running between the wickets. If a ball is hit out of the playing area with the flat faced wooden bat along the ground, the batting team gets four runs. If it goes into the stands on the fly, it\u2019s six runs \u2013 the equivalent of a home run. The bowling side records outs either by hitting the stumps with the ball or by rapping the batter on the leg pad in front of them in a dismissal known as leg before wicket or LBW. The bowling team can also get outs \u2013 also confusingly known as wickets \u2013 when close catchers or outfielders catch the ball before it bounces or by using it to knock down the stumps if a batter is running between them. Each team has 10 outs in an inning and the winning side is the one that gets the most runs. The match is divided into units called overs \u2013 groups of six balls delivered by one bowler. The T20 format is played over 20 overs. There\u2019s a day-long version of the game over 50 overs. The most exalted form of cricket is the Test Match. These games are limited by time and not overs and play out like a long Shakespearean drama in five six-hour days in a row and include two innings per team. Test matches have waned in popularity in some countries as life speeds up and attention spans wane. But they are still popular in places like England and Australia. In the 1932-33 season Down Under, the two nations came close to breaking off diplomatic relations because of a dispute over \u201cBodyline\u201d tactics pioneered by the England team \u2013 the bowling of fast short-pitched deliveries at a batter\u2019s head designed to thwart Australian phenom Donald Bradman, the Michael Jordan of his day. The first ever international cricket match was in the US but can the game catch on here? Cricket has a long history in this country. The first ever international fixture was between the United States and Canada in 1844 in New York. But baseball soon superseded cricket in the US. The game however is becoming increasingly visible. There are hundreds of club teams, and it is no longer unusual to see games in public parks in big US cities with teams mostly drawn from Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan and Bangladeshi communities. Elite US cricket is dominated by players of South Asian or Caribbean descent. The bowler in the super over \u2013 overtime play after the match against Pakistan \u2013 was Saurabh Netravalkar, a left-arm fast bowler who played Under-19s for India and now works in the tech industry in California. Milind Kumar, the outfielder who pulled off a spectacular catch (cricketers use their bare hands not mitts) was born in New Delhi. The question now is whether the USA\u2019s stunning win will trigger a rush of interest from outside the South Asian diaspora. The obstacles are huge. Most Americans couldn\u2019t watch Thursday\u2019s game even if they\u2019d have known it was on. The World Cup is being carried in the US on Willow TV, a streaming service that is also available on cable systems for an extra fee. It\u2019s tough for foreign sports to break into the idiosyncratic US market as established sports are bedded in popular culture, local communities and the rhythm of the seasons. The global game, soccer, has several times hubristically tried to conquer the US and it\u2019s taken years to reach its current level with strong pro leagues the MLS and the NWSL. But NBC\u2019s coverage of England\u2019s Premier League has broadened the game\u2019s appeal. It\u2019s not unusual now to see a Manchester United or Arsenal game on TV at college football tailgates in the Deep South on Saturday mornings. But considering almost every American kid plays soccer, the game ought to be bigger than it is. The wildly successful US Women\u2019s National Team might be a model for USA Cricket as it seeks to get girls involved. The best thing that could happen for America\u2019s cricketers would be a prolonged run at the 2028 Olympics that could catch the public\u2019s attention on national TV. The Olympics, and the national pride that comes with winning medals could also help cricket expand far beyond its current geographic footprint. \u201cInevitably, you have countries like the United States, China, and others that as far as possible, try to enter teams or athletes into medal winning sports,\u201d said Chadwick, who was speaking from Belgium. \u201cI think this transition from being a colonial pastime to being a medal winning Olympic sport is a game changer. It\u2019s a predictor of a likely increasing engagement with cricket around the world.\u201d But the game\u2019s growth in the US will be hampered by the lack of school or community cricket for kids and no path to the currently impossible dream of the sport being played in colleges. And the women\u2019s game is starting from a tiny base. Only about 400 of the 200,000 registered players in the US are female. \u201cYou can look at this event in two ways, depending on how you define success,\u201d said Della Penna, mentioning good World Cup ticket sales to South Asian expatriates and fans originating from Commonwealth nations. But there are high cultural and economic barriers to entry for other Americans to a sport that requires expensive equipment and coaching. \u201cIf you\u2019re defining success by a measure of what kind of legacy will be left behind after the circus leaves town, you\u2019re not going to find much success because you\u2019re not seeing kids play,\u201d Della Penna said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/sport/cricket-united-states-changing-world/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "sports"}}

With Gauff leading 2-1 in the second set, a line judge called her return of serve \u201cout\u201d but the umpire overruled the decision. The American then argued the line judge\u2019s call impacted her shot, but the umpire disagreed. A tearful Gauff regained her composure to break \u015awi\u0105tek\u2019s serve but went on to lose 6-2 6-4 to the World No. 1. \u201cTennis is the only sport where not only we don\u2019t have the VR system, but a lot of times the decisions are made by one person. In other sports there are usually multiple refs making a decision,\u201d Gauff told reporters. \u201cI know the US Open brought some of it last year, I believe, I know we used it in our doubles at one point. I definitely think at this point it\u2019s almost ridiculous we don\u2019t have it. Not just speaking because that happened to me, but I just think every sport has it. \u201cAlso, there are so many decisions that are made, and it sucks as a player to go back or online and you see that you were completely right, and it\u2019s, like, what does that give you in that moment? \u201cIn situations you can call for the supervisor, but there\u2019s not much they can do from that standpoint. I definitely think as a sport we have to evolve, and we have the technology.

{"id": "2023_09_20_sport_saudi-arabia-soccer-spl-bin-salman-intl-spt-cmd-dg", "text": "When Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal reportedly planned a $1.1 billion bid to sign French soccer superstar Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 \u2013 including $332 million to his club, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), and an eye-watering $775 million salary packet to the World Cup winner for just one year \u2013 it was slammed by critics as sportswashing. Mbapp\u00e9 might have said no to the offer in July, but a month later, Neymar Jr. said yes to Al-Hilal, as the Brazil star moved from PSG for a transfer fee of around $98.5 million (\u20ac90 million) plus add-ons, according to multiple reports. In a record-breaking transfer window, Saudi Pro League (SPL) clubs spent close to $1 billion, acquiring 94 overseas players from Europe\u2019s major leagues \u2013 France\u2019s Ligue 1, Spain\u2019s La Liga, Italy\u2019s Serie A, Germany\u2019s Bundesliga and the English Premier League \u2013 according to Deloitte. Despite the Arab nation\u2019s poor human rights record, Saudi Arabia\u2019s spending spree to turn its domestic soccer league into a star-studded, bona fide competition shows the seriousness of its ambition. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman says he doesn\u2019t \u201ccare\u201d about the country\u2019s investment in sport being described as sportswashing. \u201cWell if sportswashing is going to increase my GDP by one percent, then I will continue doing sportswashing,\u201d MBS said in an\u00a0interview\u00a0with Fox News which aired Wednesday. Pressed on if he was bothered by the use of the term, MBS continued: \u201cI don\u2019t care. I have one percent GDP growth from sport, and I am aiming for another one and a half percent. Call it whatever you want, we\u2019re going to get that one and a half percent.\u201d Saudi clubs, several of which have been taken over by the nation\u2019s sovereign Public Investment Fund (PIF), have already attracted some of the biggest names in the sport. By attracting some of the world\u2019s biggest stars to the Gulf states, the SPL wants \u201cto drive competitiveness on and off the pitch,\u201d though it\u2019s keen to emphasize that these overseas players will help develop \u201cyoung Saudi talent.\u201d During this summer transfer window, the government-controlled PIF increased the cumulative value of these four clubs nearly five times, making them the most valuable in the country, according to estimates by the sports website Transfermarkt. Plenty of other leading stars have eagerly said yes to the SPL, notably 2022 Ballon D\u2019Or winner Karim Benzema joining Al-Ittihad at the end of his contract with Spanish soccer giant Real Madrid. As the European transfer window came to a close, the four PIF-owned teams have spent nearly $900 million (\u20ac835.1 million) on buying elite international players, Transfermarkt data shows, which ranked them in the top 20 clubs in the world by transfer expenditure, alongside soccer giants from England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy. Al Hilal alone paid more than $378 million (\u20ac353 million), more than PSG and Arsenal, making it the second-largest spender this year. The newly acquired players join five-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, who has a two-year contract with Al-Nassr where he will earn a staggering estimated $200 million a year, according to Saudi state-owned media, currently making him the world\u2019s highest paid soccer player. As of today, 21 of the most expensive soccer players in Saudi Arabia by transfer fees \u2013 all international stars \u2013 play for one of the PIF-owned clubs. Despite the financial outlay, the SPL is remaining deliberately tight-lipped about the specifics of its financial gamble, with chief operating officer Carlo Nohra confirming to CNN Sport that it was \u201cnot in [the SPL\u2019s] competitive advantage\u201d to report the salaries offered to players and coaches. The PIF has $777 billion in assets under management, according to its most recent filing, with ambitions to top $1 trillion within a few years. In 2021, it acquired English soccer club Newcastle United, before focusing on investments at home. The club is now also among top spenders on players. Saudi clubs not owned by the PIF are also splurging on big-ticket players, with former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson, 33, offered an eye-watering salary of $870,000 (\u00a3700,000) per week, according to multiple reports, in an estimated $15 million (\u00a312 million) transfer from Liverpool to Saudi team Al-Ettifaq. In a recent interview with The Athletic, Henderson said those numbers \u201cjust aren\u2019t true.\u201d \u201cEssentially, the signal is \u2018We mean business,\u2019\u201d Simon Chadwick, a professor of sport and geopolitical economy at SKEMA Business School, told CNN.\u201cWe\u2019ve got so much money that for a player who is \u2026 coming towards the end of his career, we can afford to pay him 700,000 [GB pounds a week], or whatever it is that he\u2019s being paid, and still have Cristiano Ronaldo and still be in the market for other players as well,\u201d Chadwick said, describing Saudi\u2019s approach to becoming a sporting superpower, adding that the sky is the limit in terms of cost. Saudi\u2019s love of soccer Saudi Arabia follows in the footsteps of several other countries \u2013 including China and Qatar in investing large sums of money to try and turn themselves into soccer powerhouses. It remains to be seen whether Saudi\u2019s turbocharged investment will have a lasting impact or resemble something like a costly rebranding effort. The Saudi national team has been to multiple World Cups, and the country\u2019s clubs have won multiple Asian titles. Saudi\u2019s victory over Argentina during last year\u2019s men\u2019s World Cup was hailed as one of the greatest upsets in tournament history, with the country\u2019s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud granting a national public holiday in recognition of the win. Club games can attract huge crowds in the Middle Eastern nation. \u201cFor example, Al-Ittihad against Al-Hilal, you\u2019re talking about drawing crowds of 40, 50, 60,000 people, these are games that are comparable in size to Chelsea vs. Arsenal, Manchester United vs. Manchester City,\u201d Chadwick said. Buying star players, some arguably past their prime, also provides an easy win for Saudi teams, according to Kieran Maguire, co-host of \u201cThe Price of Football\u201d podcast. \u201cFrom the Saudi authorities\u2019 point of view, they\u2019re getting a ready-made product. Everybody\u2019s heard of Benzema. Everybody\u2019s heard of Cristiano Ronaldo and so on,\u201d Maguire said. Saudi Arabia\u2019s lofty sporting ambitions don\u2019t end with the SPL or Newcastle United. The country is hosting the 2023 FIFA Club World Cup and is bidding to host the 2027 AFC Asian Cup. Several media reports also indicated that the Gulf kingdom was considering launching a bid for the 2030 FIFA men\u2019s World Cup alongside Greece and Egypt \u2013 although it is reportedly mulling pulling its candidacy. Meanwhile, the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) has agreed to a contract that will see the Spanish Super Cup played in Saudi Arabia until 2029, a deal that will earn the Spanish governing body between \u20ac35-45 million ($38-48 million) a year. Appealing to the youth Saudi Arabia has a very young population: the country\u2019s most recent census revealed 32.2 million people live in the country, nearly 42% of whom are foreign nationals \u2013 and 51% of the Saudi population are under the age of 30.\u202fOf this populace, Saudi authorities say that over 80% play, attend or follow soccer, the national sport. Chadwick explains that Saudi Arabia\u2019s government is concerned with the prospect of its younger members of society becoming radicalized or an anti-government sentiment bubbling up like that of the Arab Spring \u2013 and looks to offer its population a thriving soccer industry to keep it placated. Though the soccer industry generates employment, revenues, export earnings and inward investment, \u201cwhat is just as significant is the security of the royal family,\u201d Chadwick adds. The Arab Spring, a wave of pro-democracy protests that washed over the Middle East and North Africa in 2011, achieved mixed results. Four Arab dictators in Libya, Yemen, Egypt and Tunisia were toppled, offering a brief sense of victory for protesters, but, since then, new wars have prompted a retreat of popular movements in the region. Meanwhile, failed uprisings in Bahrain and eastern Saudi Arabia were followed by years-long crackdowns and a continuing civil war in Syria. \u201cWhat we\u2019re beginning to see in Saudi Arabia right now is the emergence of a new social contract. And the social contract essentially is catering for the needs of the Gen Z population,\u201d Chadwick said. \u201cYou want Ronaldo? You got him. You want some of the best football teams in the world? You got them. You want the World Cup to come to Saudi Arabia? You got it \u2026 But don\u2019t question us,\u201d Chadwick explained. Maguire agrees, noting that investing in soccer \u201ccan be seen as part of a much broader socio-economic plan, run by the Saudi authorities.\u201d At the same time, there has been \u201ca significant increase in the number of Saudi Arabians detained by the authorities, for example, for posting adverse comments on social media about the country\u201d this year, Chadwick told CNN. Human rights group Amnesty International told CNN that it has documented a rollback in human rights in Saudi Arabia, including an escalating crackdown on freedom of expression and an increased use of counterterrorism and cybercrime laws to silence dissent. Between 2022 and 2023, the organization said it has documented an increase in criminal prosecutions compared to previous years. In 2022, Amnesty reported the highest number of annual executions in the country in 30 years, with 196 people killed. \u201cReputation is important in terms of attracting foreign investment, and \u2026 Mohammed bin Salman, as much as he has significant financial muscle, needs foreign investing for the realization of his diversification,\u201d James Dorsey, the author of the syndicated column and blog, \u201cThe Turbulent World of Middle East Soccer,\u201d explains. Saudi Arabia is the world\u2019s biggest exporter of crude oil, and nearly two-thirds of its income still comes from selling fossil fuels. But with oil prices regularly dipping below what the Gulf state needs to balance its budget, it has focused efforts on trying to bring in investment from abroad along with its efforts to raise oil prices. Projections indicate the kingdom has around 20 years to diversify its economy to ensure it is more resilient, according to Chadwick \u2013 not least to fund its Vision 2030 projects, including the $500 billion Neom city, a 106 mile-long linear city called The Line and a futuristic plan to revamp the capital. \u201cPart of the grand vision of Mohammed bin Salman, looking forward to 2030, he does have his desire to make Saudi Arabia less dependent on natural resources to look at a post-fuel economy [involving] tourism, entertainment. If Saudi Arabia can become a hub for major sporting events, then that\u2019s a way of attracting interest to the country,\u201d said Maguire. CNN has reached out to the Saudi Ministry of Sport for comment on allegations that the kingdom has been rolling back human rights, and investing in soccer as a way of \u201csportswashing\u201d its image. In response to previous criticism about Saudi Arabia\u2019s purported \u201csportswashing,\u201d the kingdom\u2019s sports minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal said: \u201cPeople that don\u2019t know Saudi Arabia, have never been to Saudi Arabia, go out and talk about it as if they\u2019ve lived there for 30 years, 40 years. So I always tell people, come to Saudi. Come and see Saudi. \u201cSee what it is, see the people, meet the people. Look at what the country is doing for the future of the people in Saudi, then you can criticize as much as you like,\u201d he added. Lack of transparency: Saudi threatens new systems of governance\u202fin sports Saudi Arabia has already disrupted the golf industry and, with soccer, Maguire told CNN, \u201cthey feel that they can do that probably on a smaller scale, but perhaps, ultimately, to generate more interest in terms of eyeballs if they go down the same route.\u201d In 2021, the Saudi government-controlled PIF bankrolled LIV Golf, reportedly at a cost of $2 billion, attracting many of the sport\u2019s top players away from the US-based PGA Tour and Europe-based DP World Tour by offering big dollar prize money, with PGA Tour board member Jimmy Dunne raising fears that they might end up \u201cowning golf.\u201d Earlier this year, the US-based PGA Tour announced it was set to partner with the Saudi-backed breakaway LIV Golf, ending a feud that has dogged the men\u2019s professional game for the past year, with Dunne warning that sport\u2019s governing body had no choice but to reach the truce to retain some measure of control. \u201cThey have an unlimited horizon and an unlimited amount of money,\u201d he said at a contentious Senate hearing on the truce between the two tours. When it comes to soccer, Aleksander Ceferin, president of European football\u2019s governing body UEFA, has dismissed the competitive threat that the SPL could pose. \u201cAs far as I know, Mbappe and [Erling] Haaland don\u2019t dream of Saudi Arabia. I don\u2019t believe that the best players at the pinnacle of their careers would go to Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said last month. \u201cWhen people talk to me about the players who went there, nobody knows where they\u2019re playing.\u201d Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp took a different view, referring to the fact that the Saudi summer transfer window stays open after European clubs see theirs close: \u201cI don\u2019t know how stable it is and I think the next two weeks will show how much of a challenge it is because whatever happens there, no one can react anymore. \u201cI don\u2019t know where it will lead to but it feels rather like a threat or a concern than not because I can\u2019t see how we really deny it in these moments, what can we do?\u201d he added. Still, the new SPL director of football, Michael Emenalo, says what Saudi soccer is doing is \u201cno different from what the Premier League have done.\u201d \u201cThere was a time when it was all about Italy. There was a time when it was all about Spain. What we\u2019re looking for in the industry is an opportunity to compete, and to compete on an even scale and to improve upon whatever exists in the industry,\u201d said Emenalo in a press release sent to CNN. New Saudi Pro League Chief Operating Officer Carlo Nohra told CNN that there is logic behind the league\u2019s strategy of money is no object to lure international stars. \u201cWe can\u2019t expect to be paying market value to entice people to come here at this early stage in our development.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0But analysts say that the difference lies in the level of transparency, which \u201csimply doesn\u2019t exist in Saudi Arabia,\u201d Chadwick explained to CNN. European soccer governing body UEFA has financial fair play (FFP) rules on teams\u2019 spending, while Major League Soccer in the US has a salary cap for its clubs. Nohra told CNN that, eventually, the country wants 0.3% of its GDP to be from soccer to make it similar to that of the Premier League on the UK economy \u2013 up from its current value of \u201c0.000 something.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve got no chance to get into that figure at present,\u201d Maguire explained, but added that the SPL could perhaps move into the top 10 of the world\u2019s domestic leagues. \u201cThat is feasible given the amount of money that they\u2019re spending.\u201d \u201cI think they\u2019re realistic. They don\u2019t say that they\u2019re going to overtake La Liga or the Premier League or the major European leagues,\u201d Maguire said. When the Peterson Institute for International Economics compared the world\u2019s sovereign wealth funds on criteria including governance, transparency and accountability in 2019, the PIF scored well below average on a measure combining these criteria, and ranked in the bottom 10 out of 64 funds, just above Russian Direct Investment Fund. CNN has reached out to the PIF for further comment about its investments in sport, particularly soccer and golf, and criticisms about its lack of transparency. Chadwick raised concerns over how a lack of financial rules affecting Saudi clubs might dilute UEFA\u2019s FFP regulations, as well as those of the Premier League, or impact world soccer governing body FIFA\u2019s systems of governance. The lack of transparency in Saudi Arabia\u2019s wealth fund has already raised suspicions in the US golfing and political spheres. Earlier this summer, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations launched an inquiry about the PGA Tour\u2019s agreement with the PIF-controlled LIV Golf. Chadwick told CNN that, so long as there is no independent organization that monitors the reporting of every league\u2019s financial endeavors, \u201cnobody really knows for sure what the accurate financial information is.\u201d \u201cThis vacuum [of information], this uncertainty is wrapped in a veneer of lobbying, which is intended to either overinflate or underinflate player transfer values and salary information because it serves a political purpose,\u201d Chadwick says, adding that this purpose is \u201csignaling.\u201d \u201cIt is almost as though football players are becoming kind of geopolitical pawns in some ways.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/09/20/sport/saudi-arabia-soccer-spl-bin-salman-intl-spt-cmd-dg/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "sports"}}

{"id": "2024_06_10_sport_carlos-alcaraz-french-open-tennis-spt-intl", "text": "As a child, Carlos Alcaraz used to run home from school to watch the French Open on TV, dreaming of one day playing on the tournament\u2019s clay courts and becoming champion. That dream became a reality on Sunday as the Spaniard defeated world No. 4 Alexander Zverev in five sets to lift his third grand slam title \u2013 all at the age of only 21. In a gritty and often unpredictable performance on Court Philippe-Chatrier, Alcaraz showed his trademark fight and resilience against Zverev, coming back from two sets to one down to become the youngest man to win major titles on clay, grass and hard courts. \u201cHonestly, first of all, I\u2019m exhausted,\u201d Alcaraz told CNN Sport\u2019s Amanda Davies the day after claiming his first title at Roland Garros. \u201cIt was a really tough one. It is a dream come true for me. I really wanted to lift this trophy one day, and then to be able to do it is a great feeling. \u201cThis tournament, I\u2019ve watched it since I was five, six years old \u2026 Being in this position right now is so, so special,\u201d he added. With Alcaraz\u2019s latest success comes yet another tattoo. He already has the dates of his grand slam wins at the US Open and Wimbledon \u2013 the latter alongside a strawberry synonymous with the tournament \u2013 inked on his skin, and now plans to get the Eiffel Tower and Sunday\u2019s date on his left ankle. It seems a fitting choice: after his victory in the City of Light, Alcaraz shared an old photo of himself aged 12, watching the tournament on a big screen in the shadow of the Paris landmark. Is he worried about running out of skin space, should he continue to accumulate more grand slam titles? \u201cThis is good news if that happens,\u201d said Alcaraz. \u201cI said to my family and to my team that it\u2019s going to be the first grand slam. If I win another French Open, I\u2019m not going to get a tattoo.\u201d With his victory over Zverev, the world No. 2 joins a long line of Spanish men to have lifted the French Open title. Rafael Nadal leads the way with a record-breaking 14 titles, while Juan Carlos Ferrero, Albert Costa, Carlos Moy\u00e1 and Sergi Bruguera have all been champions since 1993. \u201cI really wanted to put my name on that list as well,\u201d said Alcaraz, who is now coached by 2003 winner Ferrero. Having sustained an arm injury ahead of this year\u2019s French Open, the Murcia native withdrew from the Italian Open but has exceeded his expectations physically over the past two weeks, winning four of his seven matches in three sets. It was only against Zverev and new world No. 1 Jannik Sinner that Alcaraz went the distance \u2013 the first man in the Open Era to win the final and the semifinal of the French Open in five sets. After losing the third set against Zverev, letting slip a 5-2 lead, he had to dig deep into his energy reserves and raise his intensity, racing around the court and chasing down every shot. The two highlights were a so-called \u201cbanana\u201d forehand \u2013 made famous by Nadal \u2013 in the fourth set and a stunning backhand passing shot when Alcaraz had seemed certain to lose the point in the deciding set. \u201cIf I lost, I wanted to do it fighting until the last ball, running, playing my best tennis,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I thought about in that moment: to keep trying to find solutions.\u201d Alcaraz\u2019s attention now turns to Wimbledon, where he will defend the title he won in dramatic fashion against Novak Djokovic last year, and then the Olympics in Paris, which will mean a return to Roland Garros. There, he hopes to play doubles alongside Nadal \u2013 potentially one of the 22-time grand slam champion\u2019s final tournaments \u2013 as well as going for a gold medal in the singles competition. \u201cI\u2019ve won Roland Garros and I\u2019m going for the Olympics,\u201d said Alcaraz. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to get both.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/sport/carlos-alcaraz-french-open-tennis-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_sport_scotland-soccer-religious-bigotry-intl-spt", "text": "Surrounded by medics, Hibernian FC player Martin Boyle lay on the pitch after diving for the ball in a Scottish Cup quarterfinal earlier this year and landing awkwardly on his head \u2013 the then 30-year-old suffered a concussion \u2013 an injury he would later describe as having sent him to \u201chell and back.\u201d The game was stopped for around 10 minutes, but as medics tended to the injured forward, chants of \u201cdie ya Fenian bastard\u201d sung by some fans of the opposing team Rangers FC echoed throughout the stadium in Edinburgh. Fenian refers to a group of 19th\u00a0century Irish revolutionaries but is widely recognized as a derogatory term for Irish Catholics. The language mirrors the division caused by centuries of war and strife between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, in part because of the west of Scotland\u2019s close historical links with Northern Ireland. \u201cOver recent years supporters\u2019 unacceptable conduct has become rife in Scotland whether that be through the use of pyrotechnics, sectarianism, objects being thrown onto the field of play or through other actions,\u201d Hibernian FC, commonly known as Hibs said in a statement in response to the chanting. Police Scotland told CNN it had received no reports regarding fans\u2019 behavior towards Boyle. A spokesperson added: \u201cI can confirm a man was arrested in connection with comments being made towards Rangers fans/staff, however, he was released without charge.\u201d David Scott, director of Nil by Mouth \u2013 a Scottish charity that campaigns against religious bigotry \u2013 told CNN \u201csectarianism is something that\u2019s very woven into the game of football.\u201d He explained that \u201cpassion, performance, poison\u201d are at the heart of the game in Scotland, with bigoted chanting taking the forefront. \u201cIt was a historic problem born of the Catholic-Protestant divide in Scottish society, especially in the West of Scotland. And it became greatly manifest in football,\u201d Scottish sports journalist Graham Spiers told CNN. \u201cThat in the main has meant anti-Catholic chanting. This is not anti-Protestant. It\u2019s not anti-Asian, it\u2019s not anti-Semitic. In the main, it has been about anti-Catholic and anti-Irish chanting,\u201d Spiers added. A problem rooted in history The fierce rivalry between Glasgow\u2019s two most famous teams \u2013 Celtic FC and Rangers \u2013 is historically one of the most vivid examples of sectarianism in Scottish football, and society. The two teams play each other in Saturday\u2019s Scottish Cup final. Historically chants have included anti-Catholic religious bigotry, or vocal support for paramilitary groups like the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). Celtic, founded by an Irish member of a Catholic religious order in 1887, wears its heritage proudly in the four-leaf clover of its team emblem. Meanwhile, Rangers, founded in 1872, was \u201chistorically and shamefully\u201d a mostly Protestant club until the 1980s, Spiers explained. \u201cRangers didn\u2019t hide it, they were proud of the fact they were all Protestant,\u201d he said. These historically religious identities and rivalries \u2013 often described as \u201cScotland\u2019s shame\u201d \u2013 extend to other Scottish clubs, including Edinburgh\u2019s historically Catholic Hibernian and Protestant Hearts of Midlothian FC. Perhaps the most violent chapter in the sectarian sports rivalry happened in 1995, when 16-year-old Celtic fan Mark Scott was killed by a man who police say had family links to a Protestant paramilitary group.  Scott was wearing a Celtic scarf while walking past a pub frequented by Loyalist fans on his way home from a match on the day of his murder. Jason Campbell was arrested, tried and convicted in 1996 for the killing. He was sentenced to life in prison but was freed on parole in 2011 following human rights legislation. And though Scotland has become more secular than when these clubs were founded some 150 years ago, \u201cthese tribal loyalties remain,\u201d said Nil by Mouth\u2019s Scott. \u201cWhen you\u2019re singing and chanting these things, you may think you\u2019re just thinking about your tradition, your background, but actually other people may just hear the hatred and agonism,\u201d said Scott. \u201cAcross the city, people will sing songs, \u2018We\u2019re up to our knees in Fenian blood, surrender or you\u2019ll die.\u2019 \u201cThey will tell you that, \u2018This is just theater, these are just words that don\u2019t mean anything, these are football chants,\u2019 that people like me are taking it too seriously. It\u2019s all culture. But it can also be a very intimidating atmosphere to be at,\u201d Scott added. According to Spiers, Celtic\u2019s support is \u201cmaybe 70% Catholic, but with a very large Protestant minority, who are Celtic fans. And they also have songs about \u2018Orange [named after King William III, also known as William of Orange and a political society] bastards,\u2019 meaning Protestants.\u201d Geographically, these are clubs whose support cuts across the geography of Scotland as well as social class, said Scott. \u201cPeople don\u2019t go to church anymore,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople don\u2019t live in these kinds of working class communities in Scotland where they used to do \u2013 people are more spread out. I think football becomes this kind of social cement that links people to parts of their past.\u201d Authorities have tried to tackle the problem, introducing legislation including The Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Act 2012, which was repealed in 2018. \u201cIf you\u2019re watching football matches with five or 10,000 people or whatever it is shouting and chanting, you can\u2019t arrest them. So you have to come up with a system of addressing that,\u201d Scott explained. There were 576 charges with a religious aggravation reported in 2022-23 according to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS), an 8% increase on the previous 12 months. The COPFS reports that \u201cover the last five years, the number of religious charges reported has fluctuated between around 530 and 670 per year.\u201d This April, Scotland\u2019s new hate crime law came into force, which focuses on \u201cstirring up hatred,\u201d \u201cracially aggravated harassment\u201d and crimes \u201caggravated by prejudice\u201d with regard to age, disability, impairment, religion, sexual orientation, transgender identity and sex characteristics \u2013 though Scott describes this law as a \u201cred herring\u201d when it comes to addressing bigotry in football given previous legislation\u00a0didn\u2019t solve the problem. A spokesperson for the Scottish Government told CNN that it is \u201cfully committed to tackling all forms of bigotry and prejudice including sectarianism.\u201d The spokesperson highlighted the new Hate Crime and Public Order Act as a mechanism to tackle hatred and prejudice, and said the government would support the police in \u201ctaking appropriate and proportionate action to safeguard public safety.\u201d Joseph Webster, Professor of the Anthropology of Religion at the University of Cambridge, told CNN that his own research shows that the majority of \u201coffensive chanting\u201d occurs when only one fan group is present, in spaces like a social club or pub, and can \u201cfoster intra-group solidarity.\u201d Webster added that his research shows an unintended consequence of the now defunct Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Act 2012 \u201cis that those fan bases feel unfairly targeted by the police, and the result is they look inward, among themselves even further, and the chanting then escalates.\u201d CNN has reached out to Police Scotland, Scottish Football Association, Rangers and Celtic for comment. Hiding a wider problem Jeanette Findlay, the Chair, and a founding member of Call it Out, a campaign against anti-Irish racism and anti-Catholic bigotry, said that outrage over anti-Catholic chanting in football is \u201ca long running diversion by the Scottish government, Scottish society.\u201d \u201cThe Scottish government and polite Scottish society don\u2019t like to acknowledge that there is, across Scottish society, geographically and in class terms, a continued anti-Catholic bigotry,\u201d she told CNN Sport, explaining that the vast majority of Catholics in Scotland are of Irish descent. The Scottish Government referred CNN to its previous statement when asked about these claims. Findlay says that the government often comments that the problem is contained to football, and by association, areas lived in by the working class. \u201cCatholics are more likely to live in poorer areas, they are over represented in the prison system, hugely overrepresented in religious aggravated hate crime. We are over represented in certain health conditions,\u201d she added. Scottish government data backs up those observations of Findlay. In almost half of religion aggravated hate crimes, \u201cthe perpetrator showed prejudice towards the Catholic community\u201d (47%), according to a Police Scotland report which reviewed recorded crimes in 2020-21. The next largest groups were Muslims and Protestants, who each made up 16% of cases, the report data based on a random sample of cases, found. In 2022-23, police noted that around one in 10 hate crimes were religiously aggravated, though this data set did not disclose which religions were targeted. Findlay said that, while she has heard hostile chants at football matches, \u201cfrankly, I\u2019m more concerned with the employment statistics, and the justice statistics and the health statistics which are more of a problem for us.\u201d \u201cSomeone calling us a Fenian bastard and threatening us on a football pitch doesn\u2019t cause us much trouble. \u201cIf they were marching past places of worship, spitting on our priests and vandalizing our churches, that\u2019s a problem. If they were standing at the door, shouting up, that should be dealt with,\u201d she added. Journalist Spiers said that, although Rangers \u201cmodernized\u201d long ago following pressure from fans and the media, prejudicial songs and their associated meanings \u201cstill hangs around Rangers like a bad stench.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019ve been at Rangers games in recent years where the atmosphere has been great \u2013 nobody is more sensitive than I am to chanting because God knows I\u2019ve written about it for 25 years.\u201d But \u201cevery so often, it will flare up and we all go. \u2018All right. It\u2019s still there. The old problem is still there.\u2019 But it\u2019s not as regular as it was 10, 20, 30, 40 years ago\u201d Spiers added. \u201cPeople find it tedious and boring and tragic. I\u2019m not actually offended by these chants, but I\u2019m embarrassed for my country. I\u2019m embarrassed for Scotland, that people will say \u2013 why are they singing about Catholics, you know, as if it\u2019s as if it\u2019s the 1920s or the 1890s?\u201d Webster is one of many who cautions against relying on legislation alone to deal with bigotry, adding: \u201cI think most people would agree that you can\u2019t prevent someone from holding bigoted attitudes by arresting them.\u201d Celtic recently won the Scottish Premiership, edging Rangers to the title. Saturday\u2019s cup final offers Rangers a chance to stop its rival from winning the double, but given the clubs\u2019 complicated history, how their respective fanbases behave will also be closely watched.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/sport/scotland-soccer-religious-bigotry-intl-spt/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_sport_diede-de-groot-tennis-unstoppable-force-spt-intl", "text": "It\u2019s one thing to beat the best. It is, however, an entirely different proposition to be the best. To evolve from the hunter and become the hunted \u2013 and not just over the course of a week, month, or perhaps even years. Moreover, to do so over a prolonged period, set against the backdrop of ever-changing competitors, landscapes and the sands of time and physiology. Wheelchair\u00a0tennis player Diede de Groot, though, has been unequivocally the dominant constant in the face of those challenges. \u2018Diede the Great\u2019 \u201cI feel a very big target on my back which is what keeps me motivated,\u201d De Groot told CNN ahead of the French Open. \u201cI know all of these girls are working towards beating me which is fun but intense at the same time. \u201cThey\u2019re not playing with any pressure when they\u2019re playing against me and I have all the pressure because there\u2019s this massive streak that\u2019s following me everywhere. \u201cAt the same time, I really try to forget about all of that and just play tennis.\u201d In a world where we\u2019re inundated daily with statistics ranging from the intriguing to the inane, De Groot\u2019s numbers make for truly remarkable reading. She is the first tennis player \u2013 wheelchair or able-bodied \u2013 ever to win three successive calendar grand slams. She is the first women\u2019s wheelchair tennis player to achieve the Golden Slam \u2013 all four grand slams and a Paralympic gold medal \u2013 in 2021. De Groot is also unbeaten in grand slam tournaments since the 2021 Australian Open, currently boasting a winning streak that has surpassed 130 matches. Based on facts and figures alone, one would be hard pushed to begrudge the 27-year-old for possessing the bold \u2013 yet prophetic and linguistically apt \u2013 social media handle of @DiedetheGreat. \u201cI was too humble to say Diede the Great,\u201d she says smiling. \u201cMy own last name Groot was already taken, so I had to come up with something else and then the literal translation of Groot is great. So that\u2019s how it sort of came to be. \u201cDuring the year, maybe I don\u2019t think about it [records] enough \u2026 especially in tennis because it\u2019s just like a continuous streak of tournaments. It\u2019s difficult to really take time. \u201cBut when I\u2019m just at home sitting, thinking of the amazing things that I\u2019ve already done to this point, I\u2019m very proud of myself.\u201d Wall of Champions So what\u2019s the secret of the Dutch star\u2019s success? \u201cI don\u2019t think I have the biggest serve. I don\u2019t think I have the biggest forehand,\u201d De Groot reflected. \u201cI just think that I\u2019m very good at all of the levels \u2026 I\u2019m a complete player. \u201cI don\u2019t really have a weak point and that\u2019s very difficult for opponents to, to play against.\u201d De Groot\u2019s current grand slam singles tally stands at 21. Her latest victory at this year\u2019s Australian Open was not only a remarkable 13th in a row but it also drew her level alongside the great Esther Vergeer\u2019s grand slam tally. Vergeer\u2019s 21st and final major title came at Roland Garros in 2012. Whilst De Groot still has some way to go to encroach on her compatriots astonishing 470-match unbeaten winning streak, it\u2019s fitting then that she\u2019ll have the chance to become the most successful women\u2019s wheelchair tennis player of all time at this year\u2019s French Open. Victory in Paris would consolidate De Groot\u2019s position as third in the all-time list of overall grand slam champions across singles and doubles. The 27-year-old\u2019s current tally stands at 39. Vergeer finished her career with 42 titles, second only to Japan\u2019s recently retired Shingo Kunieda, the most decorated men\u2019s player in the history of wheelchair tennis, who amassed an astonishing 50 majors. Hotbed of talent Aside from her technical prowess, the foundations of De Groot\u2019s trophy-laden career \u2013 and for that matter her compatriot Vergeer\u2019s \u2013 can also be attributed to the Dutch tennis system. It\u2019s one which allows wheelchair tennis to integrate with able-bodied players, a strategy that has worked to stunning effect. \u201cI started wheelchair tennis when I was seven years old \u2026 I had a few operations done on my hip [and] the rehabilitation center advised me: \u2018Hey, would you like tennis?\u2019 I picked it up, and I loved it straight away,\u201d said De Groot, who was born with unequal leg length. \u201cTo have that feeling that I could play tennis just like all the other kids in the group \u2026 it was very special to have that. \u201cWe are fully integrated into the KNLTB [Royal Dutch Lawn Tennis Association] program. We are treated like athletes [and] being taken seriously really helps taking yourself seriously.\u201d The KNLT\u2019s National Tennis Centre, located in Amstelveen, boasts 14 outdoor and 14 indoor courts with accessibility for wheelchair tennis. \u201cTwenty years ago wheelchair tennis was one of the biggest Paralympic sports in the Netherlands,\u201d says De Groot. \u201cWe already were very lucky to have a very good number one gold medalist [Vergeer] and because we were such a small country, we could all see each other play. \u201cAnd just learning from previous generations \u2026 I could learn from the women that went before me. I could see it from up close and therefore mimic it or even try to do better.\u201d De Groot and Vergeer both herald from the historic Dutch city of Woerden, which has produced a conveyor belt of some of the greatest players from The Netherlands to have ever graced the sport. So is there something special in the Woerden waters. \u201cWe lived very close to each other which is actually quite special,\u201d De Groot says. \u201cAnother world number one \u2013 Jiske Griffioen \u2013 also comes from there. So, it\u2019s just a coincidence \u2026 but it\u2019s a funny coincidence!\u201d \u2018We are being noticed\u2019 Wheelchair tennis events are now gradually being incorporated into a growing number of ATP and WTA events. The prestigious Miami Open hosted an event for the very first time earlier this year and Wimbledon has announced it will double the size of the wheelchair draws for this summer\u2019s tournament. \u201cI would say that from history, Paralympics were always the moment that all eyes were on us,\u201d reflected De Groot. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have to share it with able-bodied athletes. \u201cBut then for another four years, we would sort of fall to the background again \u2026 now I really feel like these players are noticing us. They\u2019re recognizing us and interacting with us more and more. \u201cI saw Jannik Sinner play with our world No. 1 Alfie Hewitt [in Miami]. Novak \u2026 he\u2019s done some really good promotion with Dylan Alcott before so hopefully these moments will be more and more \u201cCountries are developing their programs and players are developing their games. It\u2019s a really fun time to be a wheelchair tennis player.\u201d Paris 2024 When it came to the Covid-impacted Tokyo Games, the Dutch star had an unprecedented weight of history of her shoulders. Dutch women have won every wheelchair tennis title \u2013 singles and doubles \u2013 since it became a medal event 32 years ago. De Groot stormed to singles and doubles gold without dropping a set in either competition. It remains one of the defining moments of her career. \u201cFor a long time, a lot of people ask me that without gold, your career wouldn\u2019t be complete. I never thought about it that way. \u201cWinning gold in Tokyo really felt like it was like a completion of so many years already that I\u2019ve been doing so well. So many things came from winning those medals that it definitely sparked something around me, which is very good.\u201d The Dutch phenom is on track to return to the clay courts of Roland Garros to defend her titles this summer at Paris 2024. It\u2019s a challenge she\u2019s relishing and with her imperious track record to date in the French capital \u2013 winning a total of nine grand slam titles \u2013 you\u2019d be a brave person to bet against her. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a different Paralympics,\u201d she says. \u201c[I] played in Rio. I was very new there. [I] Played in Tokyo. No one was allowed to come and watch and I had all the pressure there. And now I\u2019m a defending champion with everyone there. \u201cIt will mean everything [to defend the titles]. It\u2019s the goal that I\u2019m aiming at. \u201cI still have many tournaments before so my head is not yet there, but it will be and I\u2019m going to enjoy it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/sport/diede-de-groot-tennis-unstoppable-force-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "sports"}}

After losing a tight opening set, Gauff recovered to win 4-6 6-2 6-3 against the eighth-seeded Jabeur, who continues her chase for a first grand slam title. The 20-year-old Gauff, meanwhile, is hoping to add to the US Open title she won last year.

She was playing really well the whole match,\u201d Gauff said in her on-court interview. \u201cShe was hitting a lot of winners which is something I\u2019m not used to against anybody.\u201d Jabeur edged ahead in the match when she broke Gauff\u2019s serve at 3-3 and went on to take the opening set, but the American responded well in a seesawing second set which saw three consecutive breaks of serve. Having leveled the match, Gauff seized the advantage with an early break in the deciding set and looked on course for victory until a nervy conclusion. Jabeur managed to rescue two match points \u2013 including one with an audacious drop shot \u2013 and also had a break point to get back on serve at 5-3. However, the Tunisian\u2019s hopes of a recovery quickly disappeared when she shanked a routine smash on Gauff\u2019s third match point out of the court for her 38th unforced error of the contest. \u201cI got a little bit tight on the last couple of match points, but I think I did what I needed to do to win the match,\u201d Gauff admitted. According to Opta, the world No. 3 is the youngest woman to reach three or more consecutive singles semifinals at grand slams since Maria Sharapova between 2006 and 2007.

Leading up to the tournament Korda \u2013 chasing a seventh win of the year \u2013 was the overwhelming favorite to win what would have been her second major of 2024, having enjoyed a scintillating start to the season. However, an opening round 10-over 80 followed by a par score of 70 in the second ended any chance of competing further at Lancaster Country Club in Pennsylvania. The American finished two shots adrift of the eight-over cut. Birdies on the sixth, seventh, and eighth holes Friday gave hope that Korda could make the cut after an awful start to the tournament, but a bogey on the par-four ninth gave her too much to do. She ended the day with a bogey on the par-four 18th. Speaking to reporters, Korda said: \u201cI knew it was going to be a tough day \u2026 Try to give it my all, you know that\u2019s what I try to do with every round.

{"id": "2024_06_03_sport_fan-caddie-injured-pan-canadian-open-spt-intl", "text": "Soaking up the thrilling climax of the RBC Canadian Open, Paul Emerson wove his way through the crowds to get a good view of the PGA Tour stars on the fourth hole. A few bizarre developments later, he was working for one of them. For two fleeting but fairy tale holes on Sunday, self-professed \u201cgolf nut\u201d Emerson was the star of the show at Ontario\u2019s Hamilton Golf and Country Club, as an injury to C.T. Pan\u2019s caddie Mike \u201cFluff\u201d Cowan presented an impromptu opportunity for one local fan to man the bag at his country\u2019s national open. With Cowan unable to continue after tripping and falling on the third fairway, Taiwan\u2019s Pan saw his clubs picked up by Dan Reynolds, caddie for Irish playing partner Shane Lowry. World No. 33 Lowry had been hauling his own bag as Pan helped Cowan in the direction of medical support, limping past one eager-to-assist spectator in a red Masters T-shirt en route. \u201cWe heard a big tumble and a big sound when Fluff wiped out,\u201d Emerson, a lawyer from nearby Aurora, Ontario, told the PGA Tour. \u201cI just simply offered. I said \u2026 do you need any help?\u201d he told CNN\u2019s \u201cNews Central\u201d on Monday. \u201c(Pan) said yes. And then next thing you know, I\u2019m helping Fluff takeoff the bib and walking up the fairway. It just all happened very fast.\u201d Heart racing, Emerson shook hands with Lowry before throwing the bag over his shoulder \u2013 unprecedented scenes that had not escaped the lenses of TV broadcasters. It was a dream start. Emerson was one-under through one hole for his PGA Tour career after Pan curled home a brilliant birdie putt from just over 20 feet, prompting the 2020 Olympic bronze medalist to toast his new ally with a shout of \u201cgreat caddie\u201d as he plucked his ball from the cup. \u201cOne for one, Paul!\u201d Lowry quipped, adding with a laugh: \u201cIt\u2019s all downhill from here.\u201d Emerson told CNN he had a chance to relax on the next tee. \u201cI just sort of soaked it up and we actually started joking around,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was all very, very friendly and fun.\u201d \u2018I didn\u2019t really want to stop\u2019 With his phone now buzzing incessantly in his pocket, Emerson took the walk up the subsequent fairway as an opportunity to ask Pan what he required. There was only one request: \u201cStay off the greens.\u201d \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m not very chatty\u2019\u201d Emerson recalled to the PGA Tour. \u201cI was like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019ll talk as much or as little as you want. \u201cHe\u2019s a really nice guy \u2013 really friendly.\u201d When asked by CNN whether he gave Pan advice, Emerson chuckled. \u201cThat would be a terrible decision on his part to ask me for guidance,\u201d he said. \u201cMy job was fairly clear, just carry the bag and keep his clubs dry.\u201d Lowry\u2019s tongue-in-cheek jibe was not entirely inaccurate, as Pan bogeyed the par-five hole. The following fairway would mark the end of the road for Emerson\u2019s caddie cameo, as a member of the caddie services team \u2013 Michael Campbell \u2013 arrived to take over from an accepting, albeit reluctant, Emerson. \u201cI said to C.T., \u2018Well, this is your decision,\u2019\u201d added Emerson, whose only previous caddying experience had been for a golfer at a Canadian Women\u2019s Open Pro-Am event. \u201cI didn\u2019t really want to stop, but he took the person who has some local knowledge.\u201d Pan had just made back-to-back birdies when he greeted his fourth bagman of the round, Al Riddell, at the 10th tee. Riddell, who had caddied for France\u2019s Paul Barjon until he missed the cut, had the best possible view of Pan\u2019s stunning eagle \u2013 a 121-yard effort that spun back into the cup \u2013 at the 12th hole. World No. 133 Pan, a one-time winner on the PGA Tour, carded a final round one-under 69 amid damp conditions to finish in tied-35th at three-under overall, 13 shots behind champion Robert MacIntyre. Cowan, 76, was treated for \u201cnonserious\u201d injuries at the clubhouse, a PGA Tour official told ESPN. CNN has reached out to the PGA Tour for an update on Cowan. The Caddie Open Quizzed on his plans for the rest of Sunday, Emerson said he was considering a shirt change to help allay the attention he was receiving around Hamilton Country Club. Yet come the end of Sunday, he had a strong rival for the title of most famous emergency caddie. Having parted ways with his bagman just a week ago, homesick MacIntyre had called on the services of his 59-year-old father Dougie, head greenskeeper at a club back home in Oban, Scotland. The duo dovetailed seamlessly as 27-year-old MacIntyre held off a flurry of big-name stars to clinch his first PGA Tour title, stamping his ticket to the US Open later this month and a $1.69 million prize check he said would go toward paying off his parent\u2019s mortgage. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. I\u2019m a grass cutter not a caddie,\u201d MacIntyre senior, wiping away tears, told CBS Sports. \u201cLast Saturday night, I\u2019m sitting on the couch at home and I\u2019m (thinking), \u2018Can I leave my job here? I\u2019m busy at work.\u2019 Eight o\u2019clock the next morning, I\u2019m on a flight out here and wow.\u201d The Canadian Open is building a reputation for throwing up storylines both beautiful and bizarre. At last year\u2019s tournament, home hero Nick Taylor ended the 69-year wait for a men\u2019s Canadian golfer to win their home open with a remarkable 72-foot eagle putt, only for friend and fellow pro Adam Hadwin to be mistakenly tackled by a security guard amid the ensuing bedlam. Hadwin laughed off the case of mistaken identity soon after, and reconnected with his former feller at this year\u2019s tournament, posting a selfie of the duo smiling to X with the caption: \u201cWater under the bridge!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/sport/fan-caddie-injured-pan-canadian-open-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "sports"}}

After these two defeats, Pakistan\u2019s progression in this tournament rests on a knife edge, dependent on the USA\u2019s results, who now have a golden chance to make the knockout stages. Such a scenario seemed unlikely for most of the match as India set a relatively low score of 119 all out and Pakistan began its run chase with composure, but key wickets lost at crucial times consigned it to a damaging defeat. Often described as one of the greatest sporting grudge matches in the world, an India-Pakistan cricket match is always bound up in the geopolitical faultlines that separate the two nations. They only play each other in international tournaments, and such was the level of excitement that on the morning of the game, it cost a minimum of $2,500 for a seat at the Nassau County International Stadium in New York. Security, including monitoring the fence line, checking cars and patrolling using horses and drones, was increased ahead of the match, with a Nassau County official telling CNN that an earlier threat by terror group ISIS-K was considered credible until proven otherwise. Rain delayed the start of the match by almost an hour and the sky was still gloomy when India\u2019s opening batsmen Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli walked out onto the crease. Rohit heaved the third ball into the stands for six to get India\u2019s innings off to the best possible start, but they were forced to leave the field after just one over to take cover from another rain shower. It seemed that India would continue where the opening pair had left off when Kohli opened his account with a glorious cover drive for four, but he was out just two balls later. And Pakistan landed a hammer blow in the next over when Rohit hit the ball straight to Haris Rauf off Shaheen Afridi, removing both of India\u2019s talismanic batters in quick succession. It was left to Rishabh Pant to restore order and though he hit boundary after boundary, India always looked shaky without establishing any sort of partnership and collapsed from 89-3 to 96-7 in the 15th over, leaving little hope of posting a competitive score. Eventually, the tail limped to 119 all out, a low score even on this temporary pitch which, with lots of uneven bounce and a sluggish outfield, has proven difficult to bat on throughout the tournament. Pakistan made an assured start to its run chase, chipping away at India\u2019s total and seemed completely in control of the match with star batsman Mohammad Rizwan anchoring the innings. But the game turned on its head with six overs left when Jasprit Bumrah bowled Rizwan and took the momentum away from Pakistan. It set up a grandstand finish with Pakistan needing 18 runs off six balls in the last over and it ultimately fell just short.

Mindframe finished the race in second. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge race to win, I lost my voice a little bit, we were riding him down the lane pretty hard,\u201d said trainer Danny Gargan after the race. \u201cSpeechless. He\u2019s such a talented horse, we\u2019ve thought so much of him all along. For him to get us here, and just be a part of it, it\u2019s a special ride.\u201d The victory is the first for Gargan in any Triple Crown race and second for Jockey Luis Saez. The race was held in New York\u2019s Saratoga Springs, 200 miles north of an under renovation Belmont Park, marking the first time in the 156-year history of the Belmont Stakes the race was hosted at a different track. It won\u2019t be held at Belmont Park until at least 2026. No Triple Crown winner in 2024 It\u2019s the sixth straight year a different horse has won each leg of the Triple Crown. The surprise Kentucky Derby champion Mystik Dan failed to keep the possibility of a Triple Crown success alive after finishing second at the Preakness Stakes last month. The race was won by Seize The Grey who held off Mystik Dan\u2019s challenge on the home stretch. Despite the two champions lining up at the start on Saturday, the pre-race favorite for the Belmont Stakes was Sierra Leone. The 3-year-old was one of the horses involved in the Derby\u2019s dramatic photo-finish, finishing second behind Mystik Dan after eventually breaking free from a congested group. The Derby, in a news release, said it was \u201cthe closest three-horse photo finish since 1947.\u201d \u201cIf (Sierra Leone) had kept a straight line, it\u2019s hard to imagine he wouldn\u2019t have won,\u201d trainer Chad Brown said, per the New York Post. \u201cBut that\u2019s horse racing, a nice consolation prize would be the Belmont.\u201d The field of stellar candidates racing at Saratoga Springs on Saturday had to contend with the change of track and distance for this year\u2019s race. The Belmont Stakes has become known as \u201cThe Test of Champions\u201d over the years, owing to the mile-and-a-half distance on the big sandy track at Belmont Park, but this year, however, the race was scaled back to a mile-and-a-quarter. The Saratoga Race Course is a shorter distance at 1-and-a-quarter miles, similar to the Kentucky Derby.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/sport/belmont-stakes-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2022_07_25_sport_black-representation-swimming-equality-spt-intl", "text": "Omie Dale has fond memories of splashing in the sea as a child, of racing through water parks and swimming in backwaters and rivers.   \u201cThere\u2019s so much joy that can be had once you learn to swim, once you\u2019ve abandoned those fears and you can get in the water,\u201d the 25-year-old Dale, who is based in southeast London, tells CNN Sport.  Even though swimming is a joyful experience for Dale, the stark reality is that many Black communities in Britain and the US do not have safe access to swimming lessons and public pools due to historic racism and segregation \u2013 a problem that is especially alarming given that, as Dale says, it is \u201cthe only sport that can save your life.\u201d  A history of exclusion The lack of access afforded to Black communities in Britain is what motivated Dale to become a swimming teacher in September 2019.  \u201cI used to work in Kensington (in London) as a lifeguard and some of the richest people live in that borough, but also some of the poorest,\u201d she says. She saw there was a difference when private schools and independent schools would come in and all the kids were able to swim, yet hardly any children of the same age that Dale saw from state schools could swim 25 meters.  \u201cThere\u2019s a real class barrier in the sport of swimming,\u201d Dale adds.   She is a director of Swimunity, a collective offering free swimming lessons to women and children in North Kensington, West London. It was born in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster in 2017, when a residential block caught on fire, killing 72 people \u2013 and leaving many more without homes.   \u201cThere\u2019s like a lot of people who come to swim lessons \u2026 who have undergone some form of trauma, whether that be water-related trauma or trauma related to their everyday lives,\u201d Dale says.   \u201cMany people say it\u2019s like an escape from their daily lives or is, actually, the first time that they\u2019ve taken time for themselves.\u201d  While 77% of children from the most affluent families in England can swim 25 meters unaided, only 34% from the least affluent families can, according to a 2021 survey from Sport England, a non-departmental public body that fosters grassroots sports in England.  About 95% of Black adults and 80% of Black children in England do not regularly participate in swimming, according to Sport England\u2019s report, published in January 2020. Likewise, about 93% of Asian adults and 78% of Asian children, including those with Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi heritage, do not regularly participate in swimming, the same research found. This trend extends to the US, where nearly 64% of Black children have \u201clow\u201d or no ability to swim, compared with 40% of their White peers, according to 2017 data from the country\u2019s national governing body for the sport at a competitive level, USA Swimming.   The underrepresentation of Black people in the pool in the US can be traced back to the early 20th century.   Public swimming pools became popular in North America in the 1920s and 30s and were initially open to all. However, Northern politicians stipulated a \u201cWhites Only\u201d rule, referencing racist fears about Black men fraternizing with White women.   Even after legal racial segregation ended in the US in 1964, public pools continued to be hostile environments. As people of color began to use public pools, White swimmers retreated to the privacy of their own pools and private clubs, where expensive fees continue to be an economic barrier for Black families who cannot afford the cost.    Similar examples in Britain illustrate how racial and class inequalities lead to the systemic exclusion of Black people in pools. For example, more than 4.2 million people in the UK live in ethnically diverse communities where Covid-19 national lockdowns resulted in the closure or mothballing of pools, according to Swim England \u2013 England\u2019s national swimming governing body \u2013 and the Black Swimming Association (BSA), a UK-based charity that aims to encourage more African, Caribbean and Asian communities to take up swimming.  \u2018We cannot keep recovering bodies\u2019  Globally, drowning is the third leading cause of accidental injury-related death and at least 236,000 people die each year from drowning, according to 2019 data from the World Health Organization (WHO). Children are particularly affected, with drowning being one of the top five causes of death for those aged 1-14 years in 48 of 85 countries studied by the WHO.   And while natural disasters and irregular migration are notorious risk factors, so are lower socioeconomic status, lack of higher education and being a member of an ethnic minority, depending on the country, WHO research shows.  \u201cMost drowning incidents happen when people never intend to get into the water in the first place,\u201d says Dale, who was awarded Swim Teacher of the Year by Swim England in 2021.  In December 2019, three members of the same Black British family \u2013 a 53-year-old father and his two children \u2013 died in a swimming pool at a resort in Costa del Sol, Spain, Reuters reported. The father and his 16-year-old son had reportedly leapt into the water to try to save his nine-year-old daughter, who was drowning.   Danielle Obe is the co-founder and chair of the BSA. She told CNN Sport that the Costa del Sol deaths prompted her to establish the BSA in March 2020, alongside Olympic swimmer Alice Dearing, journalist Seren Jones and songwriter, rapper and producer Ed Accura.    \u201cThis was devastating because these families were actually acquainted to me and they were from my local community,\u201d Obe says. \u201c(At) that point, I called Alice and Seren, and I said, \u2018We\u2019ve been talking about doing something for our community. We\u2019ve got to do something. We\u2019ve got to do it now. We cannot keep recovering bodies.\u2019\u201d   \u201cIt\u2019s no longer just about that lack of representation,\u201d Obe adds.   \u201cIt\u2019s now about saving lives, vital water safety, education for all. Swimming is an intervention. Swimming is a life skill.\u201d  However, there is still a lack of data when it comes to drowning-related deaths by ethnicity in the UK, says Obe.  \u201cAt the moment, we don\u2019t know how much of a disparity there is between drowning and fatalities, aquatic fatalities for different communities in the UK because, up until now, drowning data isn\u2019t really captured by ethnicity, which is another point, another issue that the BSA is looking to tackle.\u201d \u2018People just don\u2019t think Black people should swim\u2019  Dearing, the first Black female swimmer to represent Britain at the Olympics when she competed at Tokyo 2020, \u201cimplores\u201d people to learn to swim.   \u201cI have been quite torn between the amazing achievement of being the first Black woman to represent GB in swimming but wanting to be my own person, my own athlete, who\u2019s known for being an athlete and not for her race and her sport combined together,\u201d she tells CNN Sport. \u201cI take the two of them just as they are \u2013 kind of like separate things. I\u2019m trying to be the best athlete and best role model that I can be to show people that they can do the sport, that the sport is for everybody.\u201d At the age of 24, Dearing was making history in Japan and became a beacon of hope for young people \u2013 especially Black girls \u2013 who wanted to break into the sport.   But her personal triumph also drew attention to the institutional access gap for people of color in swimming.    \u201cFortunately, for myself, I haven\u2019t come across any barriers at the level I\u2019m at currently,\u201d Dearing says.   \u201cBut I have faced barriers when I was younger and issues where people just don\u2019t think Black people should swim, or do swim, or think that we\u2019re better suited to other sports and so shouldn\u2019t even learn to swim or attempt swimming in the first place.\u201d  CNN reached out to the International Swimming Federation (FINA), Sport England and USA Swimming requesting a breakdown of Black and ethnic minority participation in swimming at grassroots and professional levels of the sport. However, they told CNN they were unable to provide such data.  FINA \u2013 the global governing body for swimming \u2013 told CNN it does not have a breakdown of the ethnicities of swimmers at a grassroots or elite level.   FINA said in 2021 it allocated $6.6 million towards development programs for distribution among all national federations and continental associations, while also pushing for diversity in the sport through its \u201cSwimming for All, Swimming for Life\u201d program.   \u201cFINA remains fully committed to non-discrimination,\u201d the organization said to CNN in a statement. \u201cFINA continues to work hard to ensure that the global aquatics community is a place where all athletes, coaches and administrators are treated equally. \u201cWork will continue to develop and grow with the support of members of the aquatics community as we strive to be at the forefront of this essential area,\u201d FINA added.    Sport England told CNN in a statement that it is \u201ccommitted to increasing investment in facilities and organisations across England to try to level up access to good quality sports and activities.\u201d \u201cBarriers to getting active persist and have even been exacerbated for some disadvantaged groups \u2013 like women, people with long-term health conditions, disabled people, people from ethnically diverse communities and lower socio-economic groups,\u201d the statement added.   Sport England said in May it announced further funding that brings its total investment in its 121 partners to more than \u00a3550 million ($670 million), which they\u2019ve selected \u201cdue to their unique position to tackle entrenched activity inequalities and influence positive change throughout the sector, their own networks and beyond.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s not all about the economic side of things. It is also about getting people to feel comfortable with putting their kids in swim lessons and in competitive swimming so that they can then go and do other aquatic-based sports,\u201d Joel Shinofield, the managing director of sport development at USA Swimming, told CNN during a phone call.  USA Swimming is a membership-serviced organization that has over 3,100 clubs and more than 400,000 members, according to the official website.   \u201cOur goal is to facilitate opportunities and make sure they\u2019re good ones. While our clubs are the ones that do that on the local level, the resources, guidance, support, financial investment that we provide can shift who those opportunities can be provided to and more broadly create access,\u201d he added.   Shinofield said that USA Swimming has established a 10-year initiative that will grant $1 million to develop learn-to-swim and competitive opportunities for communities served by Historical Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The program was announced in 2021, according to the USA Swimming official website.   Serving underrepresented communities  From representing their organization at the UK\u2019s first Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Summit For Sport in Birmingham, England earlier this year to facilitating swimming classes in Hackney \u2013 one of the most deprived boroughs in London \u2013 Obe hopes that the BSA will help bridge the barrier through community-level engagement.   \u201cThat community engagement really is to build trust, accountability and collaboration with disenfranchised communities and the sector,\u201d says Obe.  \u201cOnly in understanding these attitudes and understanding some of the barriers that preclude our communities from engaging in aquatics can we begin to drive change.\u201d  In August 2021, the BSA announced it would conduct a research program with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the University of Portsmouth, exploring the behaviors and barriers that prevent African, Caribbean and Asian communities from swimming.    Speaking about the program, Obe says: \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to inspire confidence with African, Caribbean and Asian communities, and the only way we\u2019re able to do that is to ensure that we understand where these communities are in the first place and understand why they don\u2019t engage in aquatics, why we don\u2019t see the representation pool side and why we don\u2019t even see the representation within some aquatic organizations.\u201d  Dale also volunteers with Mental Health Swims, a grassroots organization that facilitates swimming meet-ups for people struggling with their mental health. As part of her work for the organization, she coordinates swim events in south London to help swimmers access the mental health benefits of the sport. She also volunteers for Pride in Water, a network that aims to increase LGBTQ+ representation in swimming.   \u2018The future is bright\u2019  Dearing says that despite the racial and economic barriers to swimming for African, Caribbean and Asian communities, she\u2019s still optimistic about the changing landscape of the sport.  \u201cI really think if anything is going to change, it\u2019s going to be now, it\u2019s going to be over the next couple of years,\u201d she says. \u201cEach story is different, each person is different and has to be understood in their own way, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, that\u2019s just another challenge that we have to face and we\u2019re up for it.  \u201cIt\u2019s tough \u2013 it\u2019s not a quick fix, but the future is bright.  \u201cI like to feel that I\u2019m giving something back to swimming and, hopefully, giving something to the Black community to hopefully achieve, strive for and change the way that Black people are viewed in swimming and the way Black people view swimming.  \u201cIt\u2019s a double-edged sword; I absolutely love doing it. Sometimes, it\u2019s really frightening and daunting, but if I\u2019m trying to make the world a better place, then sometimes you got to step out and scare yourself.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/07/25/sport/black-representation-swimming-equality-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "sports"}}

{"id": "2024_06_09_sport_us-sports-betting-spt-intl", "text": "It has been\u00a0an uncomfortable\u00a0few days for US sports and betting. Earlier this week,\u00a0Ippei Mizuhara, longtime interpreter of Japanese baseball star Shohei Ohtani, pleaded\u00a0guilty\u00a0in court to fraud and tax charges for stealing almost $17 million from the Los Angeles Dodgers slugger to pay off gambling debts. The hearing came on the same day that Major League Baseball (MLB) banned\u00a0San Diego Padres player Tucupita Marcano\u00a0for life after he bet on\u00a0baseball\u00a0games, as well as suspending four other players for a year for betting on games while in the minor leagues. Meanwhile, a Brooklyn man was charged with conspiring with three others to defraud a sports betting company by using inside information from\u00a0a National Basketball Association (NBA)\u00a0player to successfully bet on the performance of that player, who was later banned from the league, according to a\u00a0federal complaint\u00a0filed this week. CNN has determined the player is former\u00a0Toronto Raptors big man Jontay Porter, who was handed a lifetime ban from the NBA after an investigation found that the 24-year-old had violated betting rules. \u201cFans and consumers will put up with a lot when it comes to sports \u2013 just look at how the vast majority of off-field issues not affecting the integrity of the game tend to fade over time,\u201d\u00a0 David Carter, adjunct professor of management and organization at USC Marshall School of Business, told CNN. \u201cBut matters affecting the integrity of the game have a chilling effect across the board and governing bodies know this is their Achilles heel,\u201d he warned. \u2018Proposition betting\u2019 Experts agree that since gambling was\u00a0effectively legalized after a US Supreme Court decision in 2018 \u2013\u00a0it\u2019s now allowed in 38\u00a0states\u00a0and Washington, DC\u00a0\u2013 the industry has boomed with nearly $120 billion put down in legal sports wagers in the\u00a0US\u00a0in 2023, one analysis found. In February, when the Super Bowl was\u00a0held, Americans bet $10.49 billion on sports, a 24.8% year-over-year increase, according to the American Gaming Association\u2019s (AGA) gaming revenue tracker. \u201cYou can bet on any game anywhere, professional or amateur, and not only on the game itself, but you can bet on the individual plays in the game. And you can do it from a smartphone just by pressing some buttons,\u201d says Andrew Zimbalist, professor of economics at Smith College. The popularity of proposition betting, which focuses on individual parts or plays in a game, also opens up numerous possibilities to rig games,\u00a0according to\u00a0Zimbalist. \u201cThere are many, many more ways in which gamblers can approach players and say, \u2018Look, I don\u2019t need your team to lose,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201c\u2019All I need to do is have you not score any points in the first minute of the second half \u2026 then do whatever you want the rest of the game.\u2019\u00a0Well,\u00a0the athlete is going to feel much more protected in that circumstance than they would if they had to blow a whole game,\u201d he explains. What Zimbalist describes exemplifies the concern of some fans as to whether they can trust what they are watching. \u201cOne of the reasons why people love sports is because of the uncertainty of the competition,\u201d adds Zimbalist. \u201cThe moment the idea comes in that this is really being rigged, it\u2019s being fixed, it\u2019s being manipulated, then the interest in the sport will decline.\u201d \u2018Every point matters\u2019 In details that emerged from\u00a0the\u00a0federal complaint concerning the\u00a0alleged\u00a0illegal betting scheme involving Porter, Brooklyn man Long Phi Pham is accused of conspiring with others who bet that the player would underperform. Authorities claim that Pham and others convinced Porter, who had significant gambling debts, to withdraw early from certain games so certain bets on game activities, like how many points he scored, would be successful.\u00a0CNN has sought comment from Pham\u2019s attorney as well as from a representative for Porter. \u201cWhether on the court or in the casino, every point matters. As alleged, the defendant and his co-conspirators, as well as an NBA player, participated in a brazen, illegal betting scheme that had a corrupting influence on two games and numerous bets,\u201d US Attorney Breon Peace said in\u00a0a statement. It was in 2018 that the US Supreme Court struck down a 1992 federal law, which had prohibited most states from allowing sports betting. Fast forward to 2024 and the gambling industry is engrained in US sports culture with leagues, franchises, players and networks now partnering with betting organizations. Victor Matheson, a professor of economics at the College of the Holy Cross, says that sports betting has always happened in the US, but that illicit schemes are now being picked up now that betting is legal and sportsbooks can study their customer base and their habits. Prior to\u00a0legalization, studies \u201csuggested that maybe as many as 1% of all college basketball games were being manipulated\u201d in the US, Matheson said. \u201cSo that would suggest there were a lot of betting problems before these things became legal that we were just missing. And now because it\u2019s legal, we\u2019re catching it,\u201d he adds. However,\u00a0illegal betting has never gone away. According to the Campaign for Fairer Gambling (CFG), some $40.92 billion in illegal gross gaming revenue was generated across America\u2019s total online gambling marketplace last year. What are the leagues doing? In Zimbalist\u2019s view, leagues\u00a0are\u00a0handing\u00a0out punishments \u201cso painful and so costly\u201d that they act as deterrents like lifetime bans. In the case of\u00a0Porter, NBA commissioner Adam Silver said he was receiving the \u201cmost severe punishment\u201d in the form of his lifetime ban in order to protect the \u201cintegrity of NBA competition for our fans, our teams and everyone associated with our sport.\u201d Other leagues with shorter bans are increasing penalties: the NFL last year revised its gambling policy to raise its ban for players who bet on their own team from one to\u00a0at least\u00a0two years. Asked for comment on the issue of betting, a\u00a0spokesperson for MLB directed CNN to a statement made Tuesday by\u00a0league commissioner\u00a0Robert D. Manfred, Jr., who said:\u00a0\u201cWe have been clear that the privilege of playing in baseball comes with a responsibility to refrain from engaging in certain types of behavior that are legal for other people. \u201cSince the Supreme Court decision opened the door to legalized sports betting, we have worked with licensed sports betting operators and other third parties to put ourselves in a better position from an integrity perspective through the transparency that a regulated sports betting system can provide. \u201cMLB will continue to invest heavily in integrity monitoring, educational programming and awareness initiatives with the goal of ensuring strict adherence to this fundamental rule of our game.\u201d CNN has reached out to the NFL and NBA for further comment on how they intend to protect the integrity of their leagues. \u2018Players involved are extremely low profile\u2019 Zimbalist and Matheson note\u00a0that\u00a0it\u2019s unlikely that US sports\u2019 biggest stars would\u00a0become embroiled in betting schemes because they are already paid tens of millions of dollars a year. \u201cThe actual players involved are extremely low profile. These are not LeBron\u00a0James, Patrick Mahomes. These are not the Connor McDavid\u2019s of the world,\u201d Matheson explains. Zimbalist adds that \u201cmediocre\u201d or newer, less established players on a lower salary might be more susceptible to agreeing to rig a game. \u201cThat person is much more likely to feel aggrieved and taken advantage of and hence be more susceptible.\u201d Carter also points out that governing bodies are working with tech companies in order to better catch illicit schemes. \u201cLeagues and governing bodies are doing as much as they can; especially when attempting to balance revenue generation, league policy, and external relations. Sometimes it seems similar to the IRS \u2013 just as one (sports gambling) loophole or workaround is shut down, another arises,\u201d he adds. However, as Zimbalist points out,\u00a0TV broadcasts for sports\u00a0have become so mainstream that fans can\u2019t watch games or read game reports without being bombarded with advertisements from sports books. Problem gambling Meanwhile research suggests\u00a0that individuals in the US with gambling disorders have\u00a0the \u201chighest suicide rate of any addiction disorder.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think we have the resources, the educational systems in place now,\u201d says Zimbalist. \u201cWe need legislation to do things like prevent sports betting advertising, and to prevent prop betting. We need some kinds of constraints, because the problem is much too big to just let the marketplace take over and people become more and more addicted or hooked on gambling.\u201d A 2023 NCAA study surveyed young adults aged 18-22, finding that among those who had seen sports gambling advertisements, 58% said it made them more likely to want to gamble. Among higher risk gamblers, about 80%\u00a0say the ads they have seen make them more likely to gamble. It\u2019s estimated that 2.5 million adults in the US \u201cmeet the criteria for a severe gambling problem in a given year,\u201d according to the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG). However, it\u00a0can be often\u00a0in leagues\u2019 financial interest for betting to increase in popularity.\u00a0For example, the NFL made over $130 million\u00a0last\u00a0year alone in gambling sponsorship deals. That\u2019s more than 5% of the league\u2019s total sponsorship revenue. \u201cThe sports leagues have turned to sports betting because it increases fan avidity. More fans will watch more games when people are betting on it and pay more attention to the news, talk more about the games,\u201d Zimbalist says. \u201cLeagues also make deals with sports books where they sell them data so they can have enough instantaneous data betting play after play \u2013 they take the share of the total amount that\u2019s bet, they charge fees. \u201cThe sports industry looks at these developments, unfortunately, as salutary for their economic health, at least in the short run and generates more revenue. And because then, because the overwhelming drive in these leaks is economic \u2014 owners want to make money and they want the value of franchises to go up,\u201d he adds.

{"id": "2024_05_08_sport_chris-birch-nasa-astronaut-cycling-spt-scn-intl", "text": "Scroll through the athlete profiles on the USA Cycling website and you\u2019ll find someone whose favorite movie is listed as \u201cInterstellar\u201d \u2013 Christopher Nolan\u2019s acclaimed sci-fi adventure released in 2014. \u201cI love realistic space movies \u2026 I\u2019m definitely a nerd,\u201d reads Chris Birch\u2019s answer on her profile page. That response proved prescient: shortly after stepping away from her professional cycling career, the Arizona native was selected from more than 12,000 applicants to join NASA\u2019s astronaut class of 2021. As career sidesteps go, it was an unusual one, though Birch had an extensive background in science with degrees in mathematics, biochemistry and molecular biophysics, and a doctorate in biological engineering. The further she progressed with her application to join NASA, the more convinced she became that she had a future in spaceflight. Interviews with panels of current and former astronauts, she thought, were stimulating, not intimidating, and so too were the selection exercises undertaken with other candidates. \u201cI really just had a blast,\u201d Birch tells CNN Sport. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like an interview at all, it didn\u2019t feel like a test. It was just super fun. And it felt like fun and games for me.\u201d It\u2019s now been close to two and a half years since Birch joined NASA, and in that time, she has practiced for space walks, learned to fly T-38 training jets and developed skills needed to operate the robotic arm on the International Space Station. Her training also involved acquiring expeditionary skills, understanding how to operate the complex systems on the space station, and even becoming proficient in Russian, the language needed to fly the Soyuz spacecraft. When she graduated at Houston\u2019s Johnson Space Center in March, the 37-year-old had few qualms about the unexpected U-turn her career had taken, her appetite for spaceflight keener than ever before. \u201cI absolutely would love to explore off this planet,\u201d says Birch. \u201cI think there\u2019s a pretty good shot that I\u2019ll get to go do science aboard the International Space Station, maybe even get to do some wrenching outside and work on making some upgrades. \u201cIt would be an absolute career highlight to be able to go back to the moon as part of one of the Artemis missions and do science on the moon.\u201d Birch left academia in 2018 to pursue a career in professional cycling, going on to win 11 national titles and represent the US at the world championships on several occasions. It was around the time that she was training to make the team for the postponed Tokyo Olympics that Birch applied to join NASA, and when she missed out on selection for the Games, she decided to throw herself wholly into her new pursuit. Despite the evident differences in cycling and spaceflight, she believes that the same sense of curiosity and wonder has motivated her in both disciplines. \u201cI think there\u2019s something really powerful about being surrounded by a group of people that are all trying deliberately to not walk the path most trodden,\u201d says Birch. \u201cWe\u2019re all looking to push the envelope in some way, and that has always been my driving mantra. The whole reason I pursued a PhD is I wanted to discover something, to build something that had never been done before. \u201cMy fascination with sport was all about seeing how fast we could go. Can we push the human body \u2013 my body, my mind \u2013 farther than I thought I could go? It really was a natural extension of that inner drive for me, if not a slight change in the technical topics.\u201d Joining NASA has meant that Birch\u2019s days of flying around a velodrome at lightning-bolt speeds are over, but her desire to test her physical limits remains. She has turned her focus towards endurance challenges, completing the iconic Leadville Trail 100 mountain bike race \u2013 a 100-mile course with 12,000 feet of elevation gain in Colorado \u2013 last year, as well as racing the Houston Marathon in January. On her radar is an attempt to break the women\u2019s time record for cycling north to south across Montana, some 400 miles on gravel roads. Challenges like that are not so far removed from astronaut training, which involves group expeditions in the field, living in the wilderness for days at a time and learning how to handle stress in a critical, unforgiving environment. \u201cCycling in particular \u2013 it just supports so much suffering,\u201d says Birch. \u201cIt\u2019s a really great avenue to practice mental toughness. It doesn\u2019t cost much, versus for me to go out and fly in a multi-engine jet aircraft is thousands of dollars an hour. \u201cThis is something that I can go do and practice that toughness training, especially if I\u2019m descending on a mountain bike trail, six hours in and I\u2019m really tired \u2013 I\u2019m now making critical handling decisions in response to my environment. \u201cI feel like that translates really well to being able to do that in the jet \u2013 it\u2019s the same mental clarity, mental focus you have to maintain. I think it\u2019s an awesome space to practice that.\u201d Birch is now firmly focused on her first projects since graduating. Recently, that\u2019s involved supporting Artemis II recovery training in the Pacific Ocean, off the coast from California. The Artemis II mission, now scheduled for September 2025 after a delay of several months, aims to send four astronauts on a journey to fly by the moon, and being able to prepare for the safe recovery of the astronauts and the capsule, Birch says, gave an \u201cincredible appreciation for the needs of the crew,\u201d even while she\u2019s still a rookie. There\u2019s no obvious timeline or pathway for when or how she might be able to venture away from planet Earth herself, but it remains a firm ambition in her life and career. \u201cI\u2019m going to prepare for that the same way I would prepare for a race,\u201d says Birch, \u201cshow up every day and give 100% to the team. If the timing works out, then that\u2019s great. But I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/sport/chris-birch-nasa-astronaut-cycling-spt-scn-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Boston was led to its 105-98 victory by guard Jrue Holiday, who had 26 points on 11 for 14 shooting. A back-and-forth first quarter was led by Mavericks star Luka Doncic, who was earlier listed as questionable to play but scored 15 points as the Mavs eked out a 28-25 lead after the quarter. After struggling offensively initially, Boston found some rhythm in the second quarter to take a slim 54-51 lead heading into halftime. The Celtics\u2019 offense finally broke out behind Jayson Tatum\u2019s big third quarter. The 26-year-old All-Star scored six of Boston\u2019s 13 points through the quarter\u2019s halfway point. The team then went on a 10-0 run to give the Celtics its largest lead of the game. Guard Payton Pritchard put an exclamation point on the team\u2019s good play, knocking down a buzzer-beater three to finish with an 84-73 lead heading into the final quarter. On a night when Boston struggled with their three-point shot, guard Derrick White was the only Celtics player to hit more than two including a big one to extend the lead to 103-89 with just over three minutes left in the game. However, the Mavericks came crawling back. Led by Doncic, Dallas went on a 9-0 run to cut the lead to just five with a little over a minute to play. After some clutch defensive plays at both ends to keep it a two-possession\u00a0game, Boston forward Jaylen Brown made a driving layup to seal the game. Doncic would register a triple-double, finishing with 32 points, 11 assists and 11 rebounds.

{"id": "2023_10_30_sport_enhanced-games-olympics-doping-spt-intl", "text": "The 2024 Olympics are fast approaching and as athletes gear up for one of the world\u2019s most prestigious sporting events, one entrepreneur has a different idea of what \u201cfaster, higher, stronger\u201d \u2013 the former motto of the Games \u2013 might represent. The Enhanced Games says it is an \u201calternative\u201d to what it calls the \u201ccorrupt Olympics Games.\u201d Athletes competing at the Enhanced Games will be free to use performance-enhancing drugs, they won\u2019t be tested and will be under no obligation to declare which substances they have taken in order to compete. That\u2019s quite a contrast to the Olympics\u2019 doping protocols. The International Testing Agency (ITA) will be responsible for looking after Paris 2024\u2019s anti-doping program. Six years ago, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which oversees the Olympics, delegated its entire clean sport program to the ITA. However, historically the Olympic Games have been dogged by a series of doping and kickback scandals. When approached for comment on the Enhanced Games and allegations of corruption, the IOC told CNN Sport that \u201cthe idea does not merit any comment.\u201d \u2018Danger to health, to sport\u2019 CNN Sport interviewed a number of experts in the field of doping for this story, who expressed concern that the Enhanced Games was an extremely dangerous proposition. Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, who exposed Russia\u2019s state-sponsored doping program \u2013 a massive, years-long effort which benefited more than 1,000 athletes between 2011 and 2015 \u2013 said that the Enhanced Games is a \u201cdanger to health, to sport.\u201d Whether the Enhanced Games will ever take place remains an open question, but the very idea is drawing considerable blowback from leading anti-doping officials and sporting organizations. The Enhanced Games is the brainchild of businessman Aron D\u2019Souza. He is also the founding editor of \u201cThe Journal Jurisprudence,\u201d a quarterly publication on legal philosophy, according to his website, which also describes him as an \u201cavid athlete.\u201d Recently, D\u2019Souza told CNN Sport he has \u201csigned term sheets with prominent venture capital firms\u201d in relation to the Enhanced Games and is \u201cwaiting on the lawyers to finish long-form drafting.\u201d He also said that a funding announcement is planned for early December. Although not legally binding, term sheets are a serious expression of intent by both sides, setting out the broad principles of an agreement. D\u2019Souza believes what he calls a \u201cscience-driven\u201d competition is the next step in the evolution of sport, suggesting that the absence of drug testing will level the playing field. According to a 2020 study from Raphael Faiss, Research Manager at the centre of Research and Expertise in anti-doping sciences at the University of Lausanne, data from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) suggests less than 2% of athletes dope. However, Faiss told CNN Sport the number of athletes taking performance-enhancing drugs is likely significantly higher; his research, based on two international major athletic events in 2011 and 2013, suggests the figure could be between 15 to 18%. Faiss and his team compared athletes\u2019 blood results collected by WADA-accredited labs to values from healthy adults, as well as doped and undoped athletes; the closer the values are to those of subjects to whom erythropoietin (EPO, which is used in blood doping) had been administered, the higher the chances that they\u2019re actually doping. This analysis, Faiss said, is not proof of doping, but is a \u201crobust way\u201d of analyzing the data, allowing scientists to make an estimate for doping prevalence, as well as targeting athletes most likely to be doping. In written comments to CNN Sport, WADA said: \u201cDetermining the level of [doping] prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed,\u201d explaining that, since 2017, a \u201cprevalence working group\u201d has been established to \u201cdetermine if strategies, reliable methods and tools can be developed to adequately assess the prevalence of doping in sports.\u201d WADA told CNN Sport that the group has delivered \u201cseveral recommendations and guidance to WADA but not the final ones yet.\u201d WADA has reservations about Faiss\u2019 study and pointed to the \u201ccomplexity of trying to measure [doping] prevalence,\u201d highlighting that reports have \u201cgreatly varying results.\u201d The anti-doping organization added: \u201cNo single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline.\u201d \u201cComparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system\u2019s testing figures isn\u2019t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence. \u201cIn any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries \u2013 it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others. \u201cThe Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures.\u201d Editor\u2019s note: You can find WADA\u2019s full statement at the bottom of this article.\u00a0 \u2018A dangerous clown show\u2019 Travis Tygart, the Chief Executive Officer at the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), told CNN Sport that the idea of an Enhanced Games is \u201cfarcical \u2026 likely illegal in many [US] states\u201d and \u201ca dangerous clown show, not real sport.\u201d Substances such as anabolic steroids \u2013 which help to build muscle mass by enabling athletes to train harder and recover quickly from strenuous workouts \u2013 are classified as a Schedule III drug by the US Drug Enforcement Administration. When asked whether anabolic steroids will be allowed at the games and whether athletes would be tested for illegal drugs such as cocaine, D\u2019Souza told CNN Sport that \u201cwe will not be drug testing at the games.\u201d He added: \u201cWe do not propose to regulate what athletes use.\u201d Anabolic steroids may be prescribed by a licensed physician for the treatment of certain conditions such as testosterone deficiency, but if used in the US without a prescription from a licensed physician, a first conviction could result in a one-year prison sentence and a $1,000 fine. But that isn\u2019t the only potential legal jeopardy the Enhanced Games faces, according to American lawyer Jim Walden, who represents Russian whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov. \u201cIf you look at the Enhanced Games website, it\u2019s almost as though they\u2019re advertising their disregard of the law,\u201d Walden told CNN Sport. \u201cThey wrap themselves up in what I will call the cloak of legitimacy by using phrases like body autonomy and coming out as an enhanced athlete. \u201cI hope they\u2019re thinking hard about how they\u2019re going to pull this off in the world in which the FBI has a specific unit that is called the Sports and Gaming Initiative that\u2019s focusing on these very issues.\u201d The Sports and Gaming Initiative was developed to \u201cprotect athletes and sporting institutions in the United States from criminal threats and influences,\u201d according to the government website. The initiative works in partnership with sports leagues and governing bodies, international law enforcement and independent watchdog groups to tackle crimes such as fraud, doping and match-fixing; criminal activities, it says, \u201cdegrade the integrity of sports and competition and erode public confidence in these cherished institutions.\u201d \u201cThe use of doping substances is not acceptable in modern sports,\u201d Rodchenkov said in his written comments to CNN. \u201cPromotion and advertising of banned substances is against sport rules and moral, letter and spirit. \u201cIt might bring an extreme harm to young generation[s] of athletes who mistakenly could believe in benefits of [the] Enhanced Games.\u201d Rodchenkov, the protagonist of the Oscar-winning Netflix documentary Icarus who is currently under FBI protection, also believes that the Enhanced Games\u2019 organizers \u201cmight get investigated [\u2026] under the Rodchenkov Act.\u201d The Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act, named after the whistleblower, allows the US to impose criminal sanctions on individuals involved in doping activities at international events. However, the Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act does not apply to sporting events that don\u2019t adopt the WADA code, which the Enhanced Games wouldn\u2019t do. Rodchenkov also added that WADA athletes could not have any affiliation or contact with so-called enhanced athletes, or they would risk being charged under Article 2.10 \u2013 \u201cProhibited Association by an Athlete or Other Person\u201d \u2013 of the World Anti-Doping Code. USADA\u2019s Tygart also told CNN Sport: \u201cNo one really wants our children growing up idolizing unbridled drug use in sport, even if some profiteers think otherwise.\u201d D\u2019Souza insists his motivation for founding the Enhanced Games isn\u2019t financial. If he had wanted to make more money, he says he\u2019d continue to be a \u201cquiet, mild-mannered venture capitalist.\u201d \u201cI do think fundamentally that consumers want this [the Enhanced Games] and athletes want this because if you go to the cinemas, no one\u2019s interested in histories in the past anymore,\u201d said D\u2019Souza. \u201cThey\u2019re interested in superheroes and technology in the future. And this is literally what we are bringing to a reality.\u201d \u2018The dirtiest Olympics in history\u2019 According to Pierre de Coubertin \u2013 the founder of the modern Olympics \u2013 \u201cfor every man, woman and child, it [sport] offers an opportunity for self-improvement.\u201d Except historically, many athletes competing in the Olympics have taken the idea of self-improvement too far, notably at London 2012, which Rodchenkov has previously called \u201cthe dirtiest Olympics in history.\u201d When the ITA concluded its re-analysis program for the London Games, it found 73 anti-doping rule violations, which led to the withdrawal of 31 medals and reallocation of 46 Olympic medals across the sports of athletics, weightlifting, wrestling and canoeing. Doping has been an issue at the Olympics throughout the event\u2019s history, and the 100-meter final at the 1988 Games has become one of the most infamous and controversial moments in sporting history. Six of the eight finalists \u2013 notably the winner, Ben Johnson \u2013 who lined up on that September day in Seoul 35 years ago would fail drug tests themselves or be implicated in drug use during their careers. Despite some athletes continuing to cheat, global antidoping efforts remain ever-present, according to the testers. Recent out-of-competition (OOC) testing data published by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) highlights positive results from steps being taken to keep \u201celite podiums and finals clean,\u201d according to the anti-doping organization. Data focused on OOC testing ahead of last year\u2019s World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon, shows how resources and testing are targeting those athletes most likely to win medals and make finals. Whilst only 39% of the athletes in Eugene had three or more OOC tests in the 10 months leading up the event, 81% of top-eight finishers had three or more OOC tests. Yet the cat and mouse game between testers and athletes using banned substances continues. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly about the question of timing and targeting the right athletes,\u201d said Faiss. Given that athletes have their blood values regularly monitored, it is \u201cgetting more difficult for athletes to use high doses [of drugs such as EPO], but they would still be using micro dosing.\u201d By taking EPO late at night and drinking enough water, the substance would not be detected in athletes the following morning, according to Faiss, though athletes suspected of blood doping could be tested in the middle of the night. \u201cAthletes are actually getting back to very simple ways of doping with steroids,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cEPO is quite simple to use, but still tricky to detect.\u201d Athletes \u201cuse the drugs that are actively working.\u201d When it comes to new substances such as Roxadustat \u2013 the drug that two-time grand slam champion Simona Halep has recently been given a four-year ban for taking, although she denies ever knowingly or intentionally taking any prohibited substance \u2013 Faiss said athletes \u201care likely to use substances with a very short half-life in [the] body that are mimicking processes of the oxygen carrying improvements through the EPO channels.\u201d Roxadustat has an elimination half-life of 10-16 hours, according to the National Institutes of Health. Athletes are \u201cseeking to find substances where the [half-life] time window is very short, to make sure that if they are not tested at the right moment, they won\u2019t be caught,\u201d said Faiss. \u2018Challenge for sporting competition\u2019 Michele Verroken, the founding director of consultancy group Sporting Integrity, believes an antidoping system is required that will \u201cgive a lot more credibility, a lot more immediacy to verifying results, if we\u2019re going to keep the hearts and minds of athletes.\u201d Verroken also questions what\u2019s stopping an athlete from cheating if they only get caught 10 years after the event, or not at all. Under the World Anti-Doping Code, there is a 10-year statute of limitations on samples taken from 2015 onwards. Verroken told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games is \u201csetting a really interesting challenge for sporting competition.\u201d Not unsurprisingly, many sporting bodies have condemned the event. The Australian Olympic Committee called it \u201cdangerous and irresponsible,\u201d saying that \u201cthe world needs better than this.\u201d UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) said it \u201cis extremely concerned by the concept of an Enhanced Games,\u201d adding that \u201cthere is no place in sport for performance enhancing drugs, nor the Enhanced Games.\u201d UKAD\u2019s Director of Operations, Hamish Coffey, told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games sets a \u201chugely dangerous precedent,\u201d expressing concern over the kind of messaging the event sends to the next generation of athletes. \u2018Very accomplished athletes\u2019 When CNN Sport spoke to D\u2019Souza shortly after the proposed event\u2019s announcement, he said that 368 athletes had enquired about the Enhanced Games and more had messaged via social media. The organization\u2019s Chief Athletes Officer and former Olympian Brett Fraser, who swam for the Cayman Islands at three Olympic Games, told CNN Sport that \u201cvery accomplished athletes\u201d at the level of Olympic finalists have reached out \u201cto understand more about how the first Games will take place and how they can become involved.\u201d Fraser added that Enhanced Games organizers \u201calready have an Olympic medallist\u201d for their athlete commission, though he didn\u2019t specify who that was. He also said there has been \u201ca lot of positive feedback and a lot of acceptance and excitement from younger generations.\u201d Nonetheless, none of the athletes appear prepared to speak publicly at this stage. For those who do want to compete, the Enhanced Games would be an annual event with five categories \u2013 track and field, swimming, weightlifting, gymnastics and martial arts. The huge cost of hosting an Olympic Games is no secret, with countries often striving to create bigger and better spectacles by blowing their budget. Tokyo 2021 had the largest Olympic sports program in history, with 33 sports competitions in 42 venues culminating in 339 medal events. The Covid-impacted Games were delivered with a final expenditure of $13 billion \u2013 almost double the $7.3 billion that was originally forecast. Meanwhile, keeping the IOC\u2019s philosophy of \u201clower-impact Games\u201d in mind, 95% of venues will be pre-existing facilities at the Paris 2024 Olympics. D\u2019Souza said the Enhanced Games will focus on fewer sports, reuse existing infrastructure and fund the event through the private sector to \u201cdeliver a high-impact yet cost-efficient games\u201d so profits can be shared with the athletes. He added that the Enhanced Games is looking for a seven-figure prize pool for any athlete potentially breaking Usain Bolt\u2019s 100-meter world record of 9.58 seconds. \u201cI\u2019ve had conversations with people who are top-10 sprinters in the world who are going to the next Olympics, and they said [\u2026] if there\u2019s a million-dollar prize to break the 100m world record, I\u2019ll be there,\u201d said D\u2019Souza. Universal basic income and mental health support to athletes will also be part of an \u201cenhanced athletes programme.\u201d When asked who would take responsibility if an athlete competing at the Enhanced Games were to suffer fatal consequences, D\u2019Souza told CNN Sport that \u201cour athletes at the games will be the most monitored athletes in history.\u201d He said: \u201cWe will focus on athlete safety by mandating athletes have pre-competition full-system clinical screenings including blood tests and EKGs.\u201d \u201cThis will ensure that athletes are healthy to complete and not at risk of major health complications.\u201d D\u2019Souza also said that athletes will sign waivers in order\u00a0to compete. As it stands, no venues are officially in place to host the event and D\u2019Souza admits its scale will be dependent on funding and media partnerships. \u201cWe\u2019re in commercial negotiations with venues and media partners at the moment,\u201d added D\u2019Souza, who said the first Enhanced Games will be at a university campus or a similar facility in the south of the US and that a number of trademarks have been filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. \u2018Undermine the very purpose of sport\u2019 Elite performance coach Trevor Painter, who has worked with a number of Olympic and international sprinters and middle-distance runners, said he would \u201cnever\u201d coach an athlete taking performance-enhancing drugs because it would go against his morals as a coach. \u201cHaving been involved with many athletes that have lost in many ways to the cheats, I won\u2019t be engaging with [the Enhanced Games],\u201d Painter told CNN Sport. If it goes ahead as planned in December 2024, D\u2019Souza insists that the Enhanced Games will unlock the potential of humanity. But according to John William Devine, Senior Lecturer in Ethics, Sport and Exercise Sciences at Swansea University in Wales, the Enhanced Games will make sporting competition more unfair than it already is and even \u201cundermine the very purpose of the sport in question.\u201d Devine told CNN Sport that \u201cperformance-enhancing drugs don\u2019t actually lead to better athletic performance. They obscure athletic performance.\u201d He added that, although the Enhanced Games may look very similar to the Olympics, the nature of the activity will be different, raising the question: \u201cTo what extent is drug-assisted performance reflective of the athletes\u2019 sporting excellence?\u201d WADA response in full: Determining the level of prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed. That is why we set up a\u00a0Working Group on Doping Prevalence\u00a0in 2017. Measuring doping prevalence is a difficult and complex process. Through its work, the group found a huge variance across the many prevalence studies that have been carried out, leading it to publish guidelines on how to improve the quality of measuring prevalence. WADA is currently developing a tool that Anti-Doping Organizations can use to evaluate the effectiveness of their programs. WADA is well aware of the [Faiss] study. Indeed, one of the contributors, Prof. Martial Saugy, is a member of the Working Group. This study is one of many that helps to inform the Group\u2019s work. It is a very narrow study. It looks at two events, in a single sport, held 10 and 12 years ago, using just one method of measurement (the Athlete Biological Passport (ABP)). As far as I am aware, there is no comparable data from more recent World Championships in the same sport. Given its limited scope, it is important that this study be analyzed within the wider context of other studies and not be taken in isolation. This study also highlights the complexity of trying to measure prevalence. It is the third published paper that sought to measure prevalence at the 2011 Athletics World Championships. Each reported greatly varying results. The fact is no single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline. Results will always come with caveats and margins of error and will be based on a variety of methods, including self-report questionnaires, analytical methods (like ABP and testing data) and other methods to give a more rounded estimate of what the most likely figure would be. Comparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system\u2019s testing figures isn\u2019t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence. In any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries \u2013 it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others. The Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/10/30/sport/enhanced-games-olympics-doping-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_sport_lexi-thompson-retirement-lpga-tour-spt-intl", "text": "Lexi Thompson will retire from professional golf at the end of the 2024 season, calling time on a decorated career at the age of 29, the American announced on Tuesday. The 11-time LPGA Tour champion revealed her decision ahead of her 18th consecutive US Women\u2019s Open appearance this week, 17 years since she burst onto the scene when \u2013 at just 12-years-old \u2013 she became the then-youngest player to ever qualify for the tournament. Having turned professional three years later in 2010, the Floridian clinched major glory at the 2014 Kraft Nabisco Championship \u2013 now the Chevron Championship \u2013 and represented Team USA at six Solheim Cups, as well as two Olympic Games. \u201cWhile it is never easy to say goodbye, it is indeed time,\u201d Thompson wrote in a letter, accompanied by a video, on Instagram. \u201cI\u2019m excited to enjoy the remainder of the year as there are still goals I want to accomplish. I\u2019m looking forward to the next chapter of my life. Time with family, friends, and my trusted companion [dog], Leo. \u201cI will always look for ways to contribute to the sport and inspire the next generation of golfers. And of course, I look forward to a little time for myself.\u201d Thompson peaked as high as world No.4 as she amassed a string of titles, but injuries contributed to a gradual drop in ranking to world No. 54. She has not registered a victory on the LPGA Tour since June 2019, but did win an individual title at the Aramco Team Series \u2013 a Ladies European Tour (LET) event \u2013 in October 2022. Finishing eight times inside the top-three at the five flagship events, Thompson repeatedly came agonizingly close to adding to her sole major crown, including an infamous near-miss at the 2017 ANA Inspiration (now Chevron Championship). A rules violation for mismarking her ball \u2013 reported by a TV viewer \u2013 saw Thompson hit with a four-shot penalty during the third round. Though she rallied to make a playoff, she was subsequently defeated by South Korea\u2019s Ryu So-yeon. \u201cYou haven\u2019t always been easy on me, or fair for that matter, but through all the ups and downs, you\u2019ve given me a platform to inspire others and positively impact the world,\u201d Thompson said in her letter. \u201cThat has been a driving force that kept me playing and relentlessly working to be better.\u201d \u2018A whirlwind of constant attention, scrutiny and pressure\u2019 Thompson spoke through tears during a press conference at Pennsylvania\u2019s Lancaster Country Club, US Women\u2019s Open host, on Tuesday. Her letter described a \u201cwhirlwind of constant attention, scrutiny and pressure\u201d since her breakthrough as a 12-years-old, with social media playing its part in Thompson sometimes finding it \u201cexhausting to maintain a smile on the outside while grappling with struggles on the inside.\u201d Asked what she was most proud of for overcoming during her career, a tearful Thompson answered: \u201cJust staying true to myself. Being out here can be a lot. It can be lonely. \u201cI\u2019ll be the last one to say like throw me a pity party. That\u2019s the last thing I want. We\u2019re doing what we love. We\u2019re trying the best every single day. You know, we\u2019re not perfect. We\u2019re humans. Words hurt. It\u2019s hard to overcome sometimes. \u201cBut having the people around you that love you and support you, I feel like that\u2019s been the biggest thing for me. I might not have a huge friend group, but to have the people that matter the most around me have gotten me through some really hard times.\u201d In October, Thompson became just the seventh woman ever to compete at the PGA Tour event when she teed up at the Shriners Open, narrowly missing out on making the cut after shooting even-par. Earlier this year, she joined compatriot Rose Zhang as the first women to take part in The Match, squaring off against PGA Tour stars Rory McIlroy and Max Homa. \u201cTo all the girls that have cheered for me, you have been my inspiration, my encouragement and my strength,\u201d Thompson added in her letter. \u201cOn the days that were tough, and I wanted to give up, your support motivated me to dig deep and keep competing.\u201d \u2018An inspirational player on and off the course\u2019 Tributes poured in from fellow players following Thompson\u2019s announcement, including from world No. 1 and the US Women\u2019s Open tournament favorite Nelly Korda. \u201cShe\u2019s had such an amazing career,\u201d Korda, chasing a seventh win in eight starts, told reporters Tuesday. \u201cI think she does an amazing job for the Tour. She spends so much time going to each Pro-Am party. She really dedicated her time to growing the game. It\u2019s sad to see that she\u2019s obviously leaving and not going to be out here with us anymore, but she\u2019s had an amazing career, and I wish her the best in this new chapter of her life.\u201d Reigning US Women\u2019s Open champion and fellow American Allisen Corpuz added: \u201cShe\u2019s had such a great career. I looked up to her, and I\u2019m not that much younger than her, but I watched her play in multiple U.S. Opens, watched her win a bunch. \u201cShe\u2019s just such an inspirational player both on and off the course. She\u2019s at pretty much every Pro-Am party, always up to do everything. Just to see how she\u2019s impacted the Tour is really special, and I just wish her all the best.\u201d LPGA greats Michelle Wie West and Annika S\u00f6renstam were among those who commented on Thompson\u2019s Instagram video, with 15-time winner Suzann Pettersen writing: \u201cThanks for all the battles, laughs and fairways we\u2019ve shared!

{"id": "2024_06_06_sport_flavor-flav-paris-olympics-water-polo-spt-intl", "text": "Flavor Flav has been many things throughout his career: rapper, reality TV star, even restaurant owner. Now, the clock-wearing musician has found a new and unlikely calling in the sports world, offering his services as hype man for the US women\u2019s water polo team ahead of this year\u2019s Paris Olympics. The decision was seemingly spontaneous. Flav decided to get behind the team after seeing an Instagram post from captain Maggie Steffens, who was making a rallying cry for more people to follow the sport with the Olympics looming. \u201cI was definitely shocked and it felt very surreal,\u201d Steffens tells CNN Sport about seeing that Flav had responded to her post. \u201cIt\u2019s great because what water polo needs, and what a lot of these niche sports need, is someone to open the door to our sport. There\u2019s only so much that we as the athletes can do.\u201d Flav, a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee best known for co-founding rap group Public Enemy, hopes to be poolside for some of the USA\u2019s games in Paris. Replying to Steffens on Instagram, he pledged to \u201cuse all my relationships and resources\u201d to support the team in the build-up to the Games. \u201cEverybody wants to know what it feels like to have that chance, and I know what it feels like to want to have a chance,\u201d Flav told TMZ Live last month. \u201cA guy like me, I try to provide that. That\u2019s why I\u2019m sponsoring this women\u2019s water polo team. I just want to help out and I just want to give back. I want to help these women achieve their goals.\u201d And those goals are not insubstantial. Steffens and her peers are aiming to make history in Paris as the first women\u2019s water polo team to win four consecutive Olympic gold medals, with the 30-year-old part of each of the previous three successes. Despite such dominance, the team is still largely unknown to many. Like other sports, water polo can struggle to attract audiences outside the spotlight of the Olympics, which only come around once every four years. That\u2019s where Flav comes in. \u201cThe best way to explain it is he\u2019s being a hype man,\u201d says Steffens. \u201cIt\u2019s honestly less about financial support, more about: how can he help [get] more eyes on our team, on the incredible women of our team and the women who have come before us? How can we get water polo in more people\u2019s mouths and in front of more people\u2019s eyes as best as possible?\u201d USA Water Polo membership almost doubled from 26,837 in 2008 to more than 50,000 in 2019, including increased participation at high school and college levels, according to USA Water Polo. Steffens, who tied the record for the most goals (21) scored at an Olympics as a teenager in 2012, acknowledges that she has seen the sport grow during her 15 years on the national team. However, she wants her legacy to be more than medals, records, and statistics, but making water polo \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d and \u201ccommon language\u201d among the general public. One day, Steffens hopes, people might understand the nuts and bolts of the sport, rather than always asking if you\u2019re allowed to touch the bottom of the pool (you\u2019re not). \u201cSometimes I\u2019ve been told, \u2018oh, too bad you\u2019re not a soccer player\u2019 or \u2018too bad you\u2019re not a basketball player\u2019 or something, because that\u2019s on TV more,\u201d she adds. \u201cBut water polo for me is my whole life. It\u2019s my gift. I wouldn\u2019t be who I am without my sport.\u201d Steffens and her teammates are currently living in Long Beach, California, training for up to seven hours each day in preparation for the Olympics. Right now, the focus is almost solely on water polo \u2013 \u201cas you get close to the Olympics, it\u2019s almost like the knife gets sharpened,\u201d says Steffens \u2013 but that\u2019s not always the case. Most water polo players have other jobs on top of their athletic careers, and for the US women\u2019s team, that means coaching in high schools and colleges, teaching, attending graduate school, or working in marketing and sales. Steffens has co-founded a data company, 6-8 Sports, and has also earned money by playing overseas. \u201cEveryone knows the cost of living in California, and most Olympians are living on minimum wage or under minimum wage,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of times you\u2019re praying for bonus money, you\u2019re praying to win a tournament so that you can afford the things that you need in order to compete, in order to live.\u201d The International Olympic Committee (IOC) doesn\u2019t distribute prize money at the Games, though athletes can earn money from their National Olympic Committees (NOCs), governing bodies, or sponsorship deals. Still, it can be challenging for athletes to fund a place at the Olympics, particularly in smaller, less mainstream sports. The US does not receive government funding for its Olympic programs, and the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee offers \u201climited\u201d financial support to sporting bodies, according to USA Water Polo, which is also funded by membership fees and gift donations. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be an Olympic athlete, unless you are a professional team athlete who makes an Olympic team, you\u2019re going to be basically forced to contribute a fair amount of money as well as time,\u201d Mark Conrad, a professor of law and ethics at Fordham University Gabelli School of Business, tells CNN Sport. \u201cAnd you have to take jobs to do that. I have heard stories of elite track and field members who have worked waiting tables, if they can \u2026 It\u2019s a difficult row to hoe if you\u2019re going to go the Olympic route.\u201d Earlier this year, World Athletics announced that it would be awarding $50,000 to each track and field gold medalist in Paris, becoming the first international federation to award prize money at an Olympics, and added that the bonus initiative would be extended to silver and bronze medalists at the Los Angeles Games in 2028. Boxing then followed suit, offering more than $3.1 million in prize money to athletes, coaches and federations at this year\u2019s Games. The announcements have placed renewed focus on the question of athlete pay at the Olympics \u2013 the most prestigious event for many of the sports being showcased. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what Olympians are able to do with their drive and ambition,\u201d says Steffens. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just water polo \u2013 this is for a lot of these niche sports that aren\u2019t able to get the support through bigger sponsorships or professional leagues.\u201d A talented athlete growing up, Steffens settled on water polo because it combined elements of other sports she enjoyed playing: the ball control of basketball, the fast arm of baseball, the team interplay of soccer, the balance of gymnastics, the physicality of hockey, and the strength and endurance of swimming. \u201cIt\u2019s super tough but I think that\u2019s why it\u2019s so fun,\u201d says Steffens. \u201cAnd it\u2019s truly for anyone. You look at the type of people who play and you look at our team and we\u2019re all different body composition, all different heights.\u201d \u201c[Water polo] can equalize that,\u201d she adds, \u201cand can highlight different strengths in people and can make you really proud of your body and what it can do.\u201d That, Steffens hopes, is something we can all cheer for \u2013 regardless of whether you\u2019re a casual fan or one of the world\u2019s most famous hype men.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/sport/flavor-flav-paris-olympics-water-polo-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_sport_kathleen-noble-rowing-uganda-paris-olympics-spt-intl", "text": "From learning how to row in boats patched together with duct tape to competing at the world championships in a different sport entirely, Kathleen Noble\u2019s rise to the apex of rowing has certainly been unconventional. Her journey now sees the 29-year-old set to become a two-time Olympian \u2013 Noble represented Uganda at the Tokyo Games \u2013 when she competes at Paris 2024. She is Uganda\u2019s first Olympic rowing participant, as well as the African nation\u2019s first and only White Olympian across any sporting discipline. A prodigious swimmer in her youth, Noble represented Uganda at the 2012 World Swimming Championships at just 17 years of age. Then, on a whim during her time as a student at Princeton University, Noble was convinced to try her hand at rowing. \u201cWhen I took my first steps into the sport, I had no thoughts or intentions of competing at a high level and certainly couldn\u2019t have imagined that this would be the direction that things would go,\u201d Noble tells CNN Sport. \u201cTo be honest, it is still a bit surreal to be competing on a stage like this. I don\u2019t think it was until they actually told me that Uganda wanted to send me to the Olympic qualifiers that I really thought, \u2018Oh, okay, maybe there\u2019s something here.\u2019\u201d Equipment issues The sport of rowing is still very much in its nascent stages across many parts of Africa, including Uganda. It was properly introduced to the country back in 2009 when the World Rowing Federation sent out a shipment of donated boats to help to grow a sport which carries with it significant financial entry barriers. It was on these boats that Noble learned to row skull (individual), as opposed to her time rowing crew (as a team in one boat) at university. Whilst the thought of training on Lake Victoria, one of Africa\u2019s Great Lakes and the world\u2019s largest tropical lake, may bring with it a sense of charm and serenity, trying to prepare to compete at Olympic level just isn\u2019t feasible given the lack of opportunities and investment afforded to rowing within Uganda, a reality which sees Noble now train out of Tennessee under former US rower James Martinez. \u201cThere is no history of rowing in Uganda. I mean, I\u2019m literally the first person, male or female, to even qualify for the Olympics,\u201d Noble says. \u201cIt is still extremely niche, and the community is very small. I probably know every single rower in the country personally. \u201cBack in 2016, I took eight months off from university to row in Uganda and I\u2019m so grateful that I did because I got to experience first-hand all the struggles that rowers back home go through on a daily basis. \u201cNot only is there a lack of competition and adequate coaching, but there is a lack of most basic essentials, such as having properly functioning equipment. \u201cWhen I was rowing on Lake Victoria, we were still using the boats donated back in 2009. We would be duct-taping them and trying to get people to patch them up with fiberglass for us.\u201d It is not just a lack of equipment which has hampered rowing\u2019s growth in the east African country. Governance is also a major issue, and the absence of proper oversight has seen many athletes leave the sport in recent times, according to Noble, due to \u201cpromises being made but not always being kept.\u201d The only way the sport has a chance to progress is through the help and funding from outside donors such as the World Rowing Federation. Muhumuza Rodrick Chandi,\u00a0the technical director of the Uganda\u00a0Rowing Federation, tells CNN Sport that the price of equipment and a lack of coaches has been an issue in the country. \u201cIt is true that there is a lack of coaches as most qualified ones have left Uganda in search of greener pastures,\u201d he says.\u00a0\u201cRowing, like most sports in Uganda, is voluntary, so once these coaches get better opportunities they migrate or leave the sport altogether. \u201cThe Ugandan Rowing Federation does suffer from a lack of funding, mainly because it doesn\u2019t get much budgetary support from the National Council of Sports as it\u2019s considered a small sport.\u201d \u2018Honor\u2019 representing Uganda Born in Nakaseke, central Uganda, in 1994, Noble is the daughter of Irish missionaries. \u201cUganda was a fantastic place to grow up in many ways, whether it be the great weather all year round or the friendly and cheerful nature of the people,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut as a White, blonde child, I maybe would have had an aversion to going out in public due to the amount of attention I\u2019d have gotten.\u201d Despite her differences, of which Noble is acutely aware, sport has allowed her to form a deeper connection with her birthplace. \u201cEven though I have Ugandan citizenship, there is an identity to being Ugandan which is about coming from one of the local tribes and having land and a history and ancestors going back a long way,\u201d she says. \u201cI respect that, but at the same time, I did grow up in Uganda. It\u2019s a place that is important to me and it does mean a lot to me to have people accept me as being Ugandan. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge honor to represent my country. It\u2019s been the way that I\u2019ve felt the most connection to my identity as a Ugandan. Growing up there, when people ask you where you\u2019re from, I would say Ireland, even though I was born and grew up there. \u201cBut I feel like as I\u2019ve gotten deeper into representing and rowing for the country, I have felt more strongly that I am Ugandan.\u201d Noble\u2019s acceptance by Ugandan sports fans has also been a great source of encouragement. While she says that she will occasionally receive the odd message on social media criticizing her for representing the country, the overwhelming majority of both fan and media messaging has been support and pride for raising the profile of Ugandan rowing. \u201cYou\u2019re always going to have haters and people who want to try to knock you down, that\u2019s kind of to be expected in high level sport nowadays with social media \u2026 but I find it extremely touching that whenever I am met with negativity, a barrage of positivity will follow,\u201d says Noble. \u201cI\u2019m very, very grateful for that.\u201d Platform for change Noble, on top of her sporting ambitions, works as a software engineer in Tennessee and, alongside her husband, is a homesteader with a small-scale farm producing food and animals for themselves. Like every athlete, she hopes that her Olympic journey will culminate atop the podium, but she does also head to Paris with a compelling sense of realism. \u201cRowing is not really a sport where you wake up and just have a great day and row faster than you ever have before,\u201d says Noble. \u201cIt is a little bit more deterministic than that. Sports that are really based around cardiovascular strength tend to remove that element of major surprise around results. I\u2019m not going to flat out say that my goal isn\u2019t to medal, but at the same time I need to be realistic.\u201d Winning a medal is not the only means by which you can determine an Olympian\u2019s success, though, with Noble hoping that her exposure during the Games can help to elevate rowing back in Uganda, ensuring that she is no longer its sole representative. \u201cI feel a sense of responsibility to try and help support athletes back home,\u201d she says. \u201cWhether that correlates to me having to do well, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily true. I get a lot of press whether I come first or last. \u201cI believe that the actual position that I come is less important than the spotlight that exists around the Olympics. That gives me the platform to raise awareness about the limitations and struggles that athletes have in Uganda to a global audience.\u201d Rowing, particularly singles rowing, can be a very isolating sport, a fact that Noble can attest to. But come July 26 when the Paris Games get underway, she will have the backing of an entire nation eager to witness what will, no matter the end result, be more Olympic history for Uganda.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/sport/kathleen-noble-rowing-uganda-paris-olympics-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "sports"}}

As well as announcing Marcano\u2019s punishment, the MLB also on Tuesday banned four other baseball players for a year apiece for violating betting rules. According to an MLB investigation, Marcano placed 387 baseball bets, including 231 MLB-related ones, over two periods in 2022 and 2023 while he was a member of the Pittsburgh Pirates and while he was on the injured list. He gambled more than $150,000 on baseball, with $87,319 of that on MLB-related bets. The MLB investigation found that 25 of those bets included Pirates games while Marcano was assigned to the Major League club. The MLB probe found that \u201calmost all of Marcano\u2019s Pirates bets were on which club (the Pirates or their opponent) would win the game or whether there would be more or less than a certain number of runs scored in the game.\u201d The MLB investigation said that \u201cthere is no evidence to suggest \u2014 and Marcano denies \u2014 that any outcomes in the baseball games on which he placed bets were compromised, influenced, or manipulated in any way.\u201d In a statement sent to CNN, the Padres said: \u201cWe cannot comment on violations that occurred outside of our organization. We fully support MLB\u2019s sports betting policy and the need to adhere to all provisions of Rule 21. We will continue to educate all members of our organization regarding their obligations under the policy.\u201d The Pirates said in a statement sent to CNN that it was \u201cextremely disappointed of Tucupita\u2019s actions and [the team is] fully supportive of Major League Baseball\u2019s ruling. \u201cThe Pirates, along with MLB, Players Association, and every Club, work to ensure all involved within our game are aware of the rules and policies around gambling. While the thorough investigation revealed no evidence of any games being compromised, influenced, or manipulated in any way in this case, protecting the integrity of our game is paramount.\u201d The four other players were banned for one year for betting on baseball games while in the minor leagues. Those players are Oakland Athletics pitcher Michael Kelly, Padres minor league pitcher Jay Groome, Philadelphia Phillies minor league infielder Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez and Arizona Diamondbacks minor league pitcher Andrew Saalfrank. The MLB said that none of the players are appealing their discipline. According to MLB rules, a player found guilty of betting on baseball games involving teams other than their own are subject to a one-year suspension. A player gambling on their own team\u2019s games will receive a lifetime ban. \u201cThe strict enforcement of Major League Baseball\u2019s rules and policies governing gambling conduct is a critical component of upholding our most important priority: protecting the integrity of our games for the fans,\u201d MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \u201cThe longstanding prohibition against betting on Major League Baseball games by those in the sport has been a bedrock principle for over a century. We have been clear that the privilege of playing in baseball comes with a responsibility to refrain from engaging in certain types of behavior that are legal for other people. \u201cSince the Supreme Court decision opened the door to legalized sports betting, we have worked with licensed sports betting operators and other third parties to put ourselves in a better position from an integrity perspective through the transparency that a regulated sports betting system can provide,\u201d added Manfred. \u201cMLB will continue to invest heavily in integrity monitoring, educational programming and awareness initiatives with the goal of ensuring strict adherence to this fundamental rule of our game.\u201d Oakland pitcher Kelly was found to have placed 10 bets involving nine MLB games for a total of $99.22. He did not appear in any of the games on which he bet, and he did not make any bets involving his assigned team. The A\u2019s said in a statement they were \u201cdisappointed to learn\u201d about Kelly\u2019s betting infringements. \u201cWhile we cannot comment on the details, this violation occurred prior to Michael joining the A\u2019s organization and we fully support MLB\u2019s sports betting policy and the need to adhere to all provisions of Rule 21,\u201d the A\u2019s said in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to educate all members of our organization regarding their obligations under the policy.\u201d Phillies minor leaguer Rodr\u00edguez placed 31 baseball bets, comprised of three bets on college baseball games and 28 MLB-related bets totaling $749.09.

{"id": "2024_06_08_sport_french-open-womens-final-spt-intl", "text": "World No. 1 Iga \u015awi\u0105tek won her third consecutive French Open title on Saturday with an emphatic 6-2 6-1 victory against Italy\u2019s Jasmine Paolini. The win \u2013 \u015awi\u0105tek\u2019s fifth grand slam crown and fourth at Roland Garros \u2013 underlines the Polish superstar\u2019s dominance on clay, extending her winning run at the tournament to 21 matches. She is the first woman since Justine Henin in 2007 to win three consecutive French Open titles, dismantling first-time grand slam finalist Paolini in just an hour and eight minutes. The 12th seed came into the final as a heavy underdog against \u015awi\u0105tek but took a surprise lead at the start of the first set when she broke her decorated opponent\u2019s serve. \u015awi\u0105tek\u2019s response, however, was swift and brutal. She won the next 10 games in a row to put the match well beyond Paolini\u2019s reach, and when the 28-year-old finally got back on the board, it was all too late. At 5-1 in the second set, \u015awi\u0105tek only had to hold her serve to win, which she did when Paolini lofted a backhand return long. Another title secured, \u015awi\u0105tek sunk to her knees in delight before climbing into the stands to embrace her team. In the later stages of this year\u2019s French Open, \u015awi\u0105tek has been unmatched, dropping just 17 games across the past five matches. But for all her superiority, she was almost ousted from the tournament by Naomi Osaka in the second round. The former world No. 1 had a match point, which \u015awi\u0105tek saved and then rallied to win the match. That has been her only blip in an otherwise phenomenal tournament. The 23-year-old has now won 19 matches in a row, collecting titles in Madrid, Rome and now Paris. In the final, she hit 18 winners, wrapped up three game to love, and faced only one break point. \u201cI love this place, I wait every year to come back here,\u201d \u015awi\u0105tek said in her on-court interview. \u201cI was almost out of the tournament in the second round so thank you for staying with me, it\u2019s been a really emotional tournament. To everyone at home, my sister, my family, my sponsors \u2013 thank you for the constant support.\u201d Paolini, meanwhile, was comprehensively outhit by \u015awi\u0105tek on Court Philippe-Chatrier However, she will soon be a top 10 player for the first time in her career after an impressive run in Paris, having two weeks ago never progressed past the second round of the French Open, nor the fourth round of a grand slam. \u201cCongratulations to everyone who made this tournament possible,\u201d Paolini said in her on-court interview. \u201c(It has been) the best days of my life, it\u2019s still going because tomorrow I have the doubles final \u2026 It\u2019s been a very intense 15 days and I\u2019m really happy and proud of myself and my team to be here. Today was tough but I\u2019m really proud of myself anyway.\u201d Beaten only twice at the French Open, \u015awi\u0105tek follows Monica Seles and Henin by claiming a third consecutive women\u2019s singles titles at Roland Garros in the Open Era. It\u2019s also the first time that a women\u2019s player has completed a three-peat at the same major tournament since Serena Williams at the US Open 10 years ago. Just two women \u2013 Chris Evert (seven) and Steffi Graf (six) \u2013 have won more French Open titles than \u015awi\u0105tek, and she will surely keep adding to her legacy with a long career still ahead of her. Even prior to the final, \u015awi\u0105tek was asked about comparisons to Rafael Nadal, who has won a record 14 singles titles at Roland Garros. \u201cWe\u2019ll see in 14 years if the journey is similar,\u201d she said, before \u2013 in her usual self-deprecating style \u2013 explaining that she was \u201cproud\u201d to be mentioned in the same sentence as the Spaniard. That comparison, it seems, will only grow stronger in the years to come.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/sport/french-open-womens-final-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Rice and Southern Methodist University player Theodore Knox are now both facing charges of one count of aggravated assault, one count of collision involving serious bodily injury and six counts of collision involving injury, according to Dallas police. While speaking to reporters on Saturday at a youth football camp in Kansas City, the 24-year-old Rice said: \u201cI\u2019ve learned so much from that. All I can do is mature and continue to grow from that. This is a step in a better direction for me.\u201d Dallas police had issued arrest warrants for Rice and\u00a0Knox after a Corvette and a Lamborghini crashed in the far-left lane of the North Central Expressway on March 31. Both men later turned themselves in to local police. Six vehicles in total were involved in the crash, authorities said. \u201cThe Lamborghini traveled onto the shoulder and hit the center median wall, causing a chain reaction collision involving four other vehicles,\u201d spokesperson Kristin Lowman told CNN. \u201cThe occupants of the Lamborghini and the Corvette all ran from the scene without stopping to determine if anyone needed medical help or providing their information.\u201d Rice\u2019s attorney has said his client\u00a0was driving the Lamborghini.

{"id": "2024_06_06_opinions_t20-cricket-world-cup-india-pakistan-new-york-ravinran", "text": "For one morning on June 9, 2024, the eyes of the cricketing world will fall on a public park on Long Island, New York. India and Pakistan will take on each other\u00a0in the Men\u2019s\u00a0T20\u00a0World Cup.\u00a0Don\u2019t worry. Tickets are still available for\u00a0a mere\u00a0$2,500 to $10,000\u00a0(other matches start at $200). Just as cricket is the\u00a0second most-watched\u00a0sport in the world, India-Pakistan matches are some of the most-viewed sporting events globally. But there\u2019s much more to cricket in America than the India-Pakistan rivalry. The fact that the US is co-hosting the World Cup for the first time, with the Caribbean, should be\u00a0seen as\u00a0a coming-of-age for what has been a neglected sport here. Now\u00a0the cricket world wants to know: Is the sport settling in for a long stay at the crease, or\u00a0is this just a flashy little cameo? In other words, can cricket ever\u00a0take root in mainstream America? Beyond the glamor of this\u00a0international\u00a0tournament and cricket officialdom, there is another America; one\u00a0where cricket has been thriving organically for years, nurtured by South Asian and Caribbean immigrants. When I moved to New York in 2012, I didn\u2019t expect to find much cricket here. My own cricket career peaked when I represented Singapore at the Under-13 level and ended after a forgettable stint for my Oxford college. But I soon realized that one of the unexpected pleasures of cricket in America was seeing the sport bloom between the cracks. I met groups of\u00a0brown and\u00a0Black immigrant teens who\u2019d been separated from their greatest passion but found ingenious ways to play it: on pot-holed, trash-strewn fields, in public parks and empty parking lots. I realized I had a lot in common with these teens. Growing up as a diasporic Indian kid in Chinese-majority Singapore, cricket gave me a sense of identity and connection to my Indian heritage. Cricket has\u00a0fared better in Singapore than in the US, though it\u2019s nowhere as popular there as say, soccer\u00a0or rugby. In Singapore, cricket training was where the\u00a0brown kids often found each other, and where I found the vast cricket universe, complete with its own myths, heroes, laws and language. Silly mid-off? Fine leg? Years later, I saw cricket providing a similar sense of identity for these teens\u00a0in New York. It was a connection to their lives back home, and to the new ones they were forging in New York. \u201cCricket here is not just a sport. It\u2019s a way for me to hold on to my culture while finding a community I can rely on,\u201d Tanvir Ahmed, a young Bangladeshi cricketer based in Brooklyn, told me. Through their eyes, the New York cricket world continued to bloom in front of me. I discovered weekend leagues, a high school league and peculiarly, the\u00a0NYPD Youth Cricket League\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the subject of my\u00a0upcoming feature documentary. Past the US Open tennis courts and the Citi Field baseball stadium, in a small section of Corona Park, Queens, the NYPD has been organizing a youth summer cricket league since\u00a02008. Created to rebuild trust with the Muslim community after 9/11, the league became a surprise hit due to pent-up demand amongst immigrant teens, desperate to play their favorite sport in a country that cared little for it. The American cricket community, who\u2019ve been slogging uphill for years, are seeing progress in other parts of the country, too.\u00a0Last year, Grand Prairie\u00a0in Texas and Morrisville in North Carolina co-hosted the inaugural\u00a0Major League Cricket\u00a0season. This year there\u2019s a second competition, the\u00a0National Cricket League, headquartered in Dallas, home to a\u00a0large South Asian community. Elsewhere,\u00a0university teams filled with international students have played in the\u00a0American College Cricket league\u00a0since 2008.\u00a0And Fort Lauderhill in Florida, with its large Guyanese, Trinidadian and Jamaican expat population, has hosted three India-West Indies series\u00a0since 2016. Still, cricket remains an oddity to most Americans. Cricket lovers here are often forced onto the back foot\u00a0when trying to explain it.\u00a0We\u2019re tempted to invoke the game\u2019s longer history in the US, the well-known immigrant refrain of \u201cwe\u2019ve been here longer than you think.\u201d Sports\u00a0journalists have\u00a0joined\u00a0our voices this week,\u00a0reminding readers\u00a0that the\u00a0first international cricket match\u00a0took place in New York between the US and Canada in 1844.\u00a0We fans\u00a0lament that cricket was played widely until, during the Civil War, it was\u00a0defeated\u00a0by baseball, its own prot\u00e9g\u00e9. We simplify the game\u2019s intricacies, hoping to be accepted, to be understood. I admit I\u2019ve told Americans some version of the following: Cricket is baseball\u2019s more excitable, older cousin, in which the\u00a0bowler hurls the ball against the ground on its way to the batter, who then scores runs by sprinting back and forth in straight lines, rather than around a diamond. And then there\u2019s\u00a0T20 cricket, the shortest version of the game designed for big hits and the format for the World Cup happening this June.\u00a0\u201cIt doesn\u2019t last 5 days! T20 takes 3 hours!\u201d\u00a0we diehards insist. But if cricket is, in Indian historian and intellectual\u00a0Ramachandra Guha\u2019s\u00a0words, the most \u201csubtle and sophisticated game known to humankind,\u201d what chance of mass appeal does it have in the land of slam dunks and the Super Bowl? Quite a bit, the World Cup organizers hope. The\u00a0US is \u201ca massive market\u2026 and part of the objective is to grow the sport\u201d, said tournament director Fawwaz Baksh.\u00a0They\u2019ve enlisted some big names to their cause.\u00a0Usain Bolt\u00a0is a tournament ambassador.\u00a0Sean Paul\u00a0sang the theme song.\u00a0Local news teams\u00a0have marveled at the temporary, purpose-built 34,000-person stadium in Eisenhower Park, Long Island \u2014 after\u00a0backlash\u00a0forced it to move from its originally proposed Bronx location. In Manhattan,\u00a0live screenings\u00a0of World Cup matches are taking place next to One World Trade Center, where a fan zone has been built.\u00a0Giant\u00a0400-pound, eight-foot tall replicas of the official T20 World Cup cricket ball have landed in\u00a0Times Square,\u00a0Dallas\u00a0and the\u00a0Greater Fort Lauderdale area. At the Bangladesh vs. India warm-up last Saturday, the first match played in the brand-new Long Island stadium, the crowd was unsurprisingly\u00a0mostly\u00a0South Asian. But I did see \u2018cricketing America\u2019 and \u2018mainstream America\u2019 co-exist briefly. Two Bangladeshi brothers admitted to me there that they\u2019d signed up for stadium security jobs so they could watch their country play on US soil for the first time \u2014\u00a0for free!\u00a0On the other hand, a solitary Yankees fan at his first cricket match, was telling people he hoped the next game he attends would be more of a nail-biter. Although cricket will officially be part of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, it\u2019s no shock that winning over America at large will be tough. Meanwhile, the initial public ballot for the India-Pakistan match was \u201cmore than 200 times over-subscribed,\u201d\u00a0according to organizers, and there were over 6 million ticket requests for the tournament. It remains to be seen how many new converts will be found among the cricket faithful who are flocking to stadiums in Texas, Florida and New York this summer. But after facing years of head-scratching and raised eyebrows in the US, this June the cricket diaspora strikes back.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/opinions/t20-cricket-world-cup-india-pakistan-new-york-ravinran/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_sport_xabi-alonso-bayer-leverkusen-season-spt-intl", "text": "In life, as in soccer, it\u2019s often said that it\u2019s not the destination, it\u2019s the journey. Xabi Alonso and Bayer Leverkusen are a living, breathing testament to that. This season, they\u2019ve taken their fans on a journey the likes of which they could only have dreamed about. A season which has defied all expectations, rewritten the history books and set new standards the likes of which the modern European game has never witnessed before. An unprecedented unbeaten domestic league season and two trophies have led to a full rebrand from the derided \u2018Neverkusen\u2019 to the lauded \u2018Neverlusen.\u2019 \u201cFor sure, it\u2019s been quite a journey [\u2026] Very challenging, very demanding,\u201d Alonso told CNN Sport\u2019s Amanda Davies at the inaugural Globe Soccer Awards Europe Edition in Sardinia, Italy. \u201cDuring the first weeks of the competition, I had a good feeling that we could make a good season. \u201cFor sure, I was not that optimistic that we could fight until the last week, but that we could have a good season? Yes.\u201d Foundations for success Prior to his arrival at the BayArena in October 2022, Alonso had coached Real Madrid\u2019s Under-14 team and Real Sociedad\u2019s B team. He says it was at Sociedad where he came to understand the importance of player development, knowledge sharing and tactical adaptability; principles which he hoped to instill in his Leverkusen side. \u201cComing back to the roots, coming back to the work with the young players [at Real Sociedad] gave me this vision that is not always the elite, elite, elite where I had been playing, [but] to come back to a few levels behind and to try to talk on their level,\u201d explained Alonso. \u201c[It] helped me a lot to develop as a coach, as a manager and I don\u2019t want to forget that.\u201d The Spaniard joined a team languishing second from last in the Bundesliga, in desperate need of fresh ideas and a clear vision for upward mobility. A successful, strategically planned transfer window last summer fused together with Alonso\u2019s desire to home in on nurturing talent was key to laying the groundwork for a remarkable turnaround in fortunes. Bringing in experience and guile in the form of midfielder Granit Xhaka, harnessing the explosive abilities of full-back \u00c1lex Grimaldo and unleashing the lethal striking ability of forward Victor Boniface, combined with the existing talent of the masterful Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong, created a blend of grit and dynamism that would carry the team across three competitions this season. \u201cLast year, it was a difficult year for the club [\u2026] When I came, the second part of the season was better. We try to get back [to] where we thought that we could make it. The goal [this year] was to make Champions League,\u201d he said. Expectation vs. reality As it turned out, Champions League would be the bare minimum of what they would achieve. Week after week, the Leverkusen juggernaut rolled on in the Bundesliga. Statement victories over an inconsistent Bayern Munich side \u2013 the winner of the last 11 league titles \u2013 a propensity for last-gasp winners and demolition jobs on all other teams who stood in their way gave growing belief in what was only once but a dream: an unbeaten season. \u201cIn the team, [the talk] wasn\u2019t that much the unbeaten run, it was more like the spectacular numbers that we were doing,\u201d he said. \u201c[From] all the media, there\u2019s this excitement of what\u2019s happening that [Leverkusen] are: \u2018One more game, one more game. 42, 43 and it continues.\u2019 So that adds some kind of pressure [\u2026] We prefer to think about short goals than more in the long term.\u201d Since winning the German Cup in 1993, Leverkusen had a propensity for falling at the final hurdle \u2013 be it finishing runner-up in the league multiple times or on the European stage, most famously to Real Madrid in the 2002 Champions League final. But not this year; after 29 games unbeaten in the league, the 31 year trophy drought was over and the club\u2019s first ever Bundesliga title had been won in dominant circumstances. Victory against Augsburg on the final day of the season completed a never before seen in Germany \u2018Invincibles\u2019 league season and extended the overall unbeaten run to 51 games, eclipsing the previous record of 48 games set by Benfica between 1963-65. \u201cWe\u2019re really proud of it. We need some time to reflect, to deal with it, to observe, to analyze properly. But for the future, I think that some of the principles that we have sustained, those are going to be really meaningful for the future.\u201d Treble hurt However, there was little time to bask in the glory of a maiden title for Alonso. A tantalizing treble was still on the cards with two defining finals in the space of four days. Firstly, Atalanta in the Europa League followed by Kaiserslautern in the German Cup. Could Leverkusen become just the second German team in history to complete a treble after Bayern Munich? Alas, the perfect season wasn\u2019t to be. Leverkusen\u2019s historic run came to a dramatic ending in the Europa League final as Ademola Lookman\u2019s hat trick delivered the Italians their second major trophy in the club\u2019s 116-year history. Redemption, though, would be served a few days later as Granit Xhaka\u2019s strike saw Alonso and his team complete a domestic double. So close, yet so far from eternity. \u201cIt\u2019s football. The exception has been the 52 that we made. To deal with the defeat it\u2019s part of our job. It\u2019s not the first time, [and] it\u2019s not going to be the last time,\u201d a reflective Alonso said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I have the intuition that that game [against Atalanta] will make me a better coach, better manager than if we would have won the treble. \u201cFor sure, those games you don\u2019t forget, and you can use that for the future. \u201cAt the moment, it hurts. It hurts so much, but I have that feeling that it will be more useful for my development than winning the treble.\u201d Competitive edge Perhaps the bigger feat achieved by Alonso, Leverkusen and the Bundesliga as a whole this season has been to remind the wider footballing world of the league\u2019s quality and competitiveness. Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich reached the Champions League final and semifinals alongside Leverkusen\u2019s astonishing exploits. Derided in some quarters as a \u2018Farmers League\u2019 for lacking apparent star power and marketing, Alonso believed German clubs\u2019 performances on the domestic and European stages this season give the Bundesliga a platform to entice a captive global audience and once again challenge, if not surpass, its European competitors. \u201cThere has always been that pride [in German football],\u201d said Alonso. \u201cThe league is so competitive. We know that. I know that pretty well because I have to work on a weekly basis on that! \u201cFor the whole of Europe or even the whole world to see how good the teams are, how good the players are \u2026 it\u2019s really, really important. \u201cI think that we need to push the Bundesliga to have this, not German projection, [but] this world projection. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be our biggest push for the league if we are able to be known worldwide [like] La Liga, as the Premier League\u2026 to not be left behind.\u201d So how does he believe the league goes about achieving that objective? \u201cPerforming, reaching finals, playing good football, helping spectacular players that they have an impact on the young kids in Leverkusen, in Dortmund but as well in San Francisco or in Delhi,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe have Florian Wirtz. We have [Jeremie] Frimpong. We have these young ones that they have a really good impact in these young kids that we have right now.\u201d Liverpool links It\u2019s perhaps no surprise that the Spaniard\u2019s rapid rise through the footballing ranks and achievements this season have garnered him many suitors. During the season, the 42-year-old was linked to then managerial vacancies at two of his former teams \u2013 Bayern Munich and Liverpool \u2013 jobs which have now been filled by Vincent Kompany and Arne Slot, respectively. Yet did Alonso give any consideration to the Liverpool job following J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s announcement in January that he\u2019d be stepping down at the end of the season? \u201cAll these decisions, they need to be thorough. You need to really think about them. And it was more about what I had, not what I\u2019m missing,\u201d he explained. \u201cFor sure, my bond with Liverpool is there and it\u2019s still there. So there\u2019s no, any kind of issue with that.\u201d Asked whether he\u2019d spoken to the Merseyside club, Alonso responded: \u201cThat\u2019s kind of behind the curtains.\u201d For how much longer those curtains will stay closed remains to be seen.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/sport/xabi-alonso-bayer-leverkusen-season-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "sports"}}

The Panthers took the Game 1 with a commanding 3-0 victory at home. The Oilers had their chances to get back into the game and outshot Florida 32-18, but Panthers goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky made 32 saves to leave Edmonton scoreless in Game 1. While losing the opening game of the series on the road is hardly a catastrophe, the Oilers are aiming to ensure that the Panthers don\u2019t run away with the series early on. How to watch Game 2 Game 2 begins at 8 p.m. ET on Monday and will be broadcast live on ABC, ESPN+, SN, TVAS and CBC. Edmonton looking to convert chances The promising signs from the offense in Game 1 offer some motivation for the Edmonton squad going into tonight\u2019s matchup. \u201cI think it\u2019s encouraging in some ways the way that we played,\u201d said Oilers forward Ryan Nugent-Hopkins. \u201cObviously, you want to stack up as many wins as you can as early as you can in a series, but it\u2019s a best-of-seven and it\u2019s a race to four [wins].

Florida is looking for its first championship in franchise history. Panthers players and staff know that they will have to improve if they are to fend off the Oilers threat and make history. \u201cI think definitely we can be better,\u201d Panthers forward Carter Verhaeghe said after Game 1. \u201cThere\u2019s always things we can improve on. I think after a week [off before Game 1], we\u2019ll take a win any way we can get it. But they outshot us, they had a lot more chances than us.

{"id": "2024_04_26_sport_aya-nakamura-france-culture-wars-paris-2024-spt-intl", "text": "Aya Nakamura was born in the former French colony of Mali, raised in France and is\u00a0widely considered\u00a0the most streamed female Francophone artist in the world. The 28-year-old,\u00a0as well as being Malian,\u00a0is a French citizen, and a multiple-platinum-selling pop star who was brought up in the Parisian suburbs. However,\u00a0ahead of Paris 2024, Nakamura finds herself at the\u00a0center\u00a0of France\u2019s culture wars. Amid widespread\u00a0rumors\u00a0the singer would\u00a0perform at the Games\u2019 Opening Ceremony, singing an Edith Piaf song,\u00a0some members of France\u2019s far-right have questioned\u00a0whether she embodies French heritage, values and identity.\u00a0Piaf is a key figure in France\u2019s musical \u2013 and national \u2013 identity. \u201cThere\u2019s no way Aya. This is Paris, not the market\u00a0in\u00a0Bamako,\u201d said fringe\u00a0and extreme\u00a0far-right group Les Natifs (Natives) on X, formerly known\u00a0as Twitter, in March, referring to Mali\u2019s capital. Nakamura has defended herself on social media, saying on X: \u201cI\u2019m becoming the number one state subject in debates\u00a0\u2026but what do I really owe you all? Nothing.\u201d The singer has received support from Rachida Dati, France\u2019s Minister of Culture, who spoke out in defence of Nakamura, saying \u201cbe careful of the pretext of attacking someone out of pure racism.\u201d Paris 2024\u2019s organizing committee told CNN: \u201cWe were very shocked by the racist attacks against Aya Nakamura in recent days. We offer our full support to the most listened-to French artist in the world.\u201d Whether Nakamura will perform at the Olympics\u2019 opening ceremony is still unconfirmed, with the Paris 2024 organizing committee telling CNN that they\u00a0\u201cwon\u2019t be confirming or denying\u201d\u00a0any rumors or reports, to \u201cleave room for surprises\u201d on the day. CNN has reached out to Nakamura but she declined to\u00a0be interviewed\u00a0on the matter. \u2018She contributes to French culture\u2019 However, many others in France are all too keen to comment on this cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. Far-right politician Marion Mar\u00e9chal,\u00a0who is the niece\u00a0of far-right National Rally party leader\u00a0Marine Le Pen and a member of the\u00a0Reconqu\u00eate\u00a0party, told French\u00a0television stations BMFTV and Europe 1\u00a0that Nakamura\u00a0\u201cdoes not sing in French,\u201d referencing the blend of Parisian and African\u00a0derived slang\u00a0that often feature in her lyrics. \u201cI think that the people who criticize her actually don\u2019t accept that she embodies France,\u201d\u00a0French activist Rokhaya Diallo told CNN. \u201cThe\u00a0slang she uses is used by young people and a lot of young French people use slang.\u201d Nakamura often uses a mix of verlan and African derived slang from languages such as Bambara, from her birth country Mali,\u00a0in her music. Her number one hit song\u00a0\u201cDjadja,\u201d\u00a0contains the lyric \u201cle monde est tit-pe\u201d \u2013 the world is small \u2013 with word \u2018tit-pe\u2019 inverting the French word \u2018petit.\u2019 Verlan, a type of French slang named after\u00a0the inversion of the French word \u2018l\u2019envers\u2019 \u2013 meaning backwards \u2013 originates from the outskirts of Paris known as \u2018la cit\u00e9\u2019 (the suburbs)\u00a0that have had\u00a0large\u00a0immigrant population. At the inauguration of the\u00a0Olympic Aquatics Centre\u00a0earlier this month, French President Emanuel Macron\u00a0said that Nakamura \u201cspeaks to a good number of our compatriots\u201d and claimed that \u201cthese\u00a0games and ceremonies should reflect us, and she contributes to French culture, to French music.\u201d \u201cI want to defend here these choices and defend the fact that there must be artistic freedom and that politics should not interfere,\u201d added Macron. In an interview with France Inter,\u00a0Macron\u2019s political rival Le Pen, known for her right-wing views, claimed that the President was seeking to \u201coutrage\u201d and \u201chumiliate the French people\u201d when asked whether she thinks Nakamura opening the games would be a\u00a0good symbol. When asked to further explain why this choice would be a humiliation, Le Pen responded \u201cshe does not sing in French, or a foreign language, she sings nonsense.\u201d Speaking to CNN, Professor of Political Science at the University of Nice,\u00a0Vincent\u00a0Martigny, said that\u00a0while\u00a0there are those who believe it is right to promote minorities and their role in French culture, there are others, who hold more traditional views, which he terms as racist in relation to the country\u2019s colonial past. 1998 World Cup There have been moments of\u00a0perceived\u00a0unity in France\u2019s past, notably when the men\u2019s national soccer team won the 1998 World Cup. That triumph helped popularise the slogan \u201cBlack, Blanc, Beur\u201d \u2013 Black, White, Arab\u00a0\u00a0\u2013\u00a0amid a push for unity and inclusion. Beur\u2019 is verlan for the French word \u2018arabe.\u2019 France\u2019s World Cup winning team of 1998\u00a0was made up of a\u00a0diverse\u00a0group\u00a0of players,\u00a0not only of European descent but also from the ex-colonies of France\u00a0and other countries.\u00a0Many thought\u00a0at the time\u00a0that the 1998 team was a sign of a truly integrated, multi-cultural France. But notable social and cultural divisions have emerged in France in recent years. There have been\u00a0multiple bans and restrictions against Islamic dress. The nationwide ban on\u00a0public\u00a0schoolchildren wearing abayas,\u00a0was\u00a0denounced as an \u201cIslamophobic campaign\u201d by\u00a0one\u00a0politician\u00a0on the left.\u00a0Athletes have been banned\u00a0from wearing a hijab while competing representing France\u00a0at the Paris\u00a0Olympic Games. Then there have been multiple protests and riots over police brutality leading to the death of\u00a0some French inhabitants of North and West African heritage\u00a0from the suburbs of Paris, fueling backlash over policing methods in marginalized communities. Nakamura\u2019s\u00a0birth\u00a0country\u00a0of Mali is one of the many\u00a0former\u00a0French colonies. There are millions of French citizens, like Nakamura, who are either themselves immigrants or descendants of immigrants from\u00a0nations formerly colonized by France. These days France\u00a0finds itself embroiled in a very public debate over the recognition and acceptance of its immigrants as the country continues to reckon with its colonial history. Professor Martigny believes that the\u00a0nationalist\u00a0party is \u201cstronger than ever\u201d and that nationalists in France are \u201cmore nationalist\u201d and more open with their views today than they were in the past. Activist Diallo also believes that France is struggling to see itself \u201cas it is\u201d and recognize non-White individuals as fully French. \u201cDespite her successes, despite her undeniable achievements, we still think that it\u2019s not an honor for us to have such a woman represent us,\u201d Diallo told CNN, referring to Nakamura. \u2018The Great Replacement\u2019 theory Political scientist Oliver Roy, who is Professor\u00a0at the EUI School of Transnational Governance, told CNN that a common belief that could be fuelling the culture wars in France is an ideology\u00a0expressed\u00a0\u201cnot just [by] the extreme right, but also part of the traditional centre right\u201d known as \u201cthe great replacement.\u201d He describes\u00a0the term\u00a0as \u201cthe idea that there is a new population coming from the south, which is replacing the old traditional, French population.\u201d However, he maintains that this fear \u201cis not supported by demography, [or] by statistics, and is, of course, very ideological.\u201d According to Martigny, France\u2019s cultural divisions are amplified on social media by both extremes of the political spectrum. \u201cBecause of the social networks, public debates are more violent on these issues than they used to be,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a theatre for the expression of extremely strong minded, sometimes racist, very often offensive comments on Twitter, on X, and on other social networks,\u201d added Martigny. \u201cYou have a lot of X accounts who are really, really, really pro far-right. And so they played a role in discussing these issues and making it a controversy. And then this controversy is exported to the traditional media.\u201d \u2018Show a very optimistic face for France\u2019 As Nakamura was targeted by fringe and extreme far-right groups as well as far-right politicians, in an interview\u00a0with BMFTV and RMC,\u00a0Macron said that \u201cthe reactions shocked me \u2026 there\u00a0were\u00a0truly racist reactions.\u201d However,\u00a0Martigny says he sees\u00a0Macron\u2019s condemnation of the attacks as racist as an attempt to balance the scales after the passing of\u00a0what the professor called\u00a0a \u201cvery restrictive law on immigration\u201d a few months ago. In December, Macron passed a controversial bill calling for tougher immigration that was endorsed by the far-right, and rejected by many in his own camp. Politicians such as Le Pen hailed the legislation as an \u201cideological victory\u201d whilst French health Minister, Aurelien Rousseau resigned in protest.\u00a0It included many amendments tightening immigration laws, one of which dictated children born to foreign parents on French soil would no longer become automatic French citizens but would have to apply for citizenship. \u201cHe needs to make that forgotten in a certain way by showing that he has a sense of balance on these issues,\u201d\u00a0Martigny states. By promoting Nakamura, Martigny believes that Macron\u2019s ambitions may have been to \u201cshow a very optimistic face for France.\u201d \u201c[There are] very strong cultural wars in France revolving around pop stars, and the type of pop stars that you can mobilize or the type of artists that you can mobilize when you want to unite the country.\u201d With less than 100 days to go until the Olympics, many hope Paris 2024 will give France the opportunity to show unity. However, the heated reactions to Nakamura hints at a more pessimistic outlook.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/26/sport/aya-nakamura-france-culture-wars-paris-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_09_sport_french-open-final-mens-final-2024-spt-intl", "text": "Carlos Alcaraz won his third grand slam title and first at the French Open on Sunday, defeating Alexander Zverev 6-3 2-6 5-7 6-1 6-2 in an engrossing contest. With the victory, the 21-year-old Alcaraz becomes the youngest man to claim a grand slam title on every surface having won the US Open in 2022 and Wimbledon last year. He came through a tense match against Zverev on Court Philippe-Chatrier to add to his collection of trophies, rallying from two sets to one down in impressive fashion. In windy conditions, the Spaniard showcased his fearless brand of tennis in front of a lively Parisian crowd. Having saved multiple break points to maintain the lead in the deciding set, he went a double break ahead before serving out for the victory in four hours and 19 minutes, sinking to the floor and punching his fists in delight. Alcaraz remains unbeaten in grand slam finals and is the youngest man to triumph at the French Open since compatriot Rafael Nadal won the third of his 14 singles titles in 2007. \u201cThe crowd has been great (for me) from the first match until today,\u201d Alcaraz said in his on-court interview, having thanked his team and family. \u201cI just have good words for you guys for the support I\u2019ve received, not only in matches but in practices \u2026 You\u2019ve made this tournament so special.\u201d After Iga Swiatek won the women\u2019s singles title in straight sets on Saturday, this was a much tighter affair as momentum swung to and from each player throughout. The pair exchanged breaks in a nervy start to the match before Alcaraz gained the upper hand with a break at 2-2. He proceeded to wrap up the set with a thumping forehand winner, but from there Zverev upped his intensity and produced much better tennis in the second set. The German, aiming to win his first grand slam title having lost to Dominic Thiem in five sets in the 2020 US Open final, had an 83% first-serve success rate in the second set as he leveled the match having gone a double break ahead. It looked as though Alcaraz had regained control of the match in the third set when he saved three break points to move into a 5-2 lead. Suddenly, however, his play dipped and Zverev came roaring back, winning the next five games to lead for the first time in the match. The world No. 3 needed to respond and did so in style. An outrageous whipped forehand handed Alcaraz a 2-0 lead in the fourth set before a well-executed drop shot engineered another break of Zverev\u2019s serve two games later. An exchange of breaks followed either side of a medical timeout for Alcaraz, who then held his serve to force a decider. This was just the second time since 2005 that the men\u2019s French Open final had gone to five sets, and a string of unforced errors from Zverev \u2013 including a double fault \u2013 was a sign that the pressure was starting to take its toll. Having moved up a break, Alcaraz then had to dig himself out of a 0-40 hole the following game to maintain the advantage. The finish line in sight, a stunning backhand passing shot helped him on the way to another break, and from there winning a third grand slam title \u2013 on hard courts, grass, and now clay \u2013 was only a formality. Zverev had his best-ever run at the French Open against the backdrop of an assault case, which, on Friday, a Berlin court announced that he and his former partner had agreed to settle with no admission of guilt from Zverev. Asked about the settlement prior to the final, the World No. 4 said that he was \u201chappy that it\u2019s over\u201d but didn\u2019t \u201cever want to hear another question about the subject again.\u201d He had to come through two five set matches \u2013 against Tallon Griekspoor and Holger Rune \u2013 in his run to the final, as well as recovering from a set down against Casper Ruud in the semifinals. Alcaraz, by contrast, had spent less time on court than his opponent, despite carrying an arm injury prior to this year\u2019s French Open. He improves his record in five-set matches to 11 wins and only one loss \u2013 a remarkable statistic for such a young player. One of those marathon wins was against Australian Open champion and soon-to-be world No. 1 Jannik Sinner in the semifinal, making Alcaraz the first man in the Open Era to win the final and the semifinal of the French Open in five sets. He may not have been at his best throughout the final against Zverev \u2013 hitting 56 unforced errors alongside 52 winners \u2013 but his latest grand slam triumph was further evidence that Alcaraz thrives when playing under enormous pressure in high-stakes matches. This was another milestone performance in what looks likely to be a remarkable tennis career.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/sport/french-open-final-mens-final-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "sports"}}
