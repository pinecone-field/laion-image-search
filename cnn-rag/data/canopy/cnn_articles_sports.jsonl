A recent high school graduate, Moore was short on experience \u2013 without the world and Olympic titles she possesses today \u2013 but high on curiosity and adrenaline. It didn\u2019t take long, however, for Teahupo\u2019o to live up to its reputation as one of the most fearsome waves on the planet. \u201cI was so out of my league,\u201d recalls Moore, who has surfed the famous break numerous times throughout her career. \u201cI had never surfed a wave like that ever in my life and was scared out of my pants.\u201d Teahupo\u2019o seems like a postcard from French Polynesia, a picture-perfect barrel cocooning surfers as they slice neatly across its face, a mass of foamy swell collapsing behind them. But in the wave\u2019s beauty lies also its danger: anyone who surfs Teahupo\u2019o risks being swallowed up by its steep, thundering wall of water and dragged onto the shallow reef below. \u201cIt\u2019s those waves that scare you the most that end up being the best,\u201d Moore tells CNN Sport. \u201cIt\u2019s this weird thing \u2013 your body and your mind are telling you no, but then you have to tell yourself that these [waves] are good, you have to go. \u201cIt\u2019s not a natural thing. The consequences are huge. I mean, if you fall, you could get really hurt. People have had some really horrible wipeouts and injuries from that wave. You have to tell yourself, \u2018Hey, I could also get the ride of my life and the thrill of my life at the same time.\u2019\u201d Teahupo\u2019o, often referred to as \u201cThe End of the Road,\u201d will play host to this year\u2019s Olympic surfing event, as well as this week\u2019s Tahiti Pro where Moore has been granted a wild card entry as she steps up her preparation for Paris 2024. The Hawaii native is at an important juncture in her career. She announced at the start of the year that she would be stepping away from competitions, appearing only at the Tahiti Pro and the Olympics. Moore insists that she is not retiring, instead referring to this period as \u201ca shift and an evolution.\u201d That means embracing pursuits away from the water \u2013 devoting time to her foundation, releasing a book, and finalizing a film with Red Bull about her life and career. This week, though, the focus is back on surfing. Unlike her rivals, Moore may not possess the sharpness that comes from having competed at multiple events already this season, but it\u2019s hard to see the five-time world champion losing her competitive edge during her brief time away from the tour. She was also able to take a training trip to Tahiti several weeks ago, a timely reminder of Teahupo\u2019o\u2019s violence and power. \u201cThe waves are big and intense and scary \u2026 I don\u2019t really feel like you can ever get totally 100% comfortable at a wave like Teahupo\u2019o, but I believe that the more that you put yourself in uncomfortable situations, the more comfortable you will get,\u201d says Moore. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of how I\u2019ve always worked. I\u2019m a very calculated risk-taker. The more time that I get out there, the better I\u2019ll feel. And I think when that opportunity comes in a heat, I\u2019ll know that I can go.\u201d Surfing made its Olympic debut in Japan three years ago, meaning Moore is the sport\u2019s first and only female gold medalist. She will, of course, want to defend her title and begin her indefinite period away from competitions on a high. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful I even won one gold medal,\u201d says the 31-year-old. \u201cIn surfing, just to have it all come together in one event with the variables and all of that is super special. \u201cI know it\u2019s asking a lot from the universe for it to have it happen again, but I believe I\u2019m going to give it my best shot. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s this huge pressure on myself to win gold \u2026 because sometimes that kind of pressure hinders performance.\u201d Environmental concerns about the staging of the Olympics in Tahiti, almost 10,000 miles from the host city of Paris, have already threatened to overshadow the event. The shallow coral reef, which helps to generate the heaviest, thickest wave in the world, was damaged by a barge last year during the construction of a nine-ton aluminum tower \u2013 something organizers said was necessary to host the 40 people involved in judging and televising the competition. That prompted outcry from the International Surf Association, as well as other members of the surf community; for World Surf League (WSL) events in Tahiti, a wooden structure is usually erected and later removed. \u201cHearing about how it was navigated could maybe have been done with more love,\u201d says Moore. \u201cI am a huge advocate for the environment and the reefs and the oceans \u2013 that\u2019s our playground \u2013 and I know that we have to do our very best to preserve it moving forward. \u201cThere\u2019s not much we can do now, but I definitely want to find a way to impact the community in a positive way and leave something for the next generation.\u201d One idea she talks about is the possibility of securing land to create a soccer field for kids living in the village of around 1,500 people, which she says is in \u201cthe brainstorming stages\u201d right now. Inspiring the next generation is a subject close to Moore\u2019s heart. Her foundation, Moore Aloha, was formed at a time when she was struggling mentally with life on tour, lacking a sense of purpose and passion. It uses surfing as a platform to empower young girls as they \u201cnavigate the waves of mental health, wellness and womanhood.\u201d \u201cGrowing up as a young woman, I realized there weren\u2019t as many opportunities for girls, especially in the ocean,\u201d says Moore. \u201cIt started off just as surf mentorship and sharing the aloha spirit, and it still is that \u2026 getting out and doing something creative is so positive and powerful for the mind. \u201cThere has been an increase in depression and anxiety and different stresses we have, and being in the ocean, you don\u2019t catch your phone. It\u2019s that one time of the day for myself, even, that the rest of the world disappears and I\u2019m present. And I think by being present, we can really get to know ourselves.\u201d Knowing herself and what she wants from life has been central to Moore\u2019s decision to step away from surfing, an announcement which had been a year in the making. She has previously discussed the possibility of starting a family, though her future, both in and away from the ocean, remains unclear. For one of the greatest surfers of all time, the luxury lies in being able to carve her own path. \u201cI\u2019m not closing the door completely on the tour and competing, but I definitely want to give myself the space and grace to figure out what\u2019s next,\u201d says Moore. \u201cMaybe I return, maybe I just focus on Moore Aloha and free surfing and doing film projects. Who knows?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/sport/carissa-moore-surfing-tahiti-olympics-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Biles, a seven-time Olympic medalist, is set to headline the event in Fort Worth, Texas, alongside fellow gold medal winner Suni Lee having won the all-around title at the Core Hydration Classic earlier this month. She will be looking to claim a ninth victory at the national championships \u2013 the final event for US gymnasts before the Olympic Trials take place at the end of June. As well as all-around Olympic gold medalist Lee, Biles will also be up against Jordan Chiles, a team silver medalist at the Tokyo Games three years ago, and reigning Olympic floor champion Jade Carey. Three-time Olympic champion Gabby Douglas was due to compete but withdrew on Wednesday after suffering an ankle injury while training, ending her hopes of competing at this year\u2019s Paris Olympics. The women\u2019s team to compete at the Olympics will be chosen after the trials, with the winner of the all-around competition automatically making the team, according to NBC.

She subsequently took time away from the sport to prioritize her mental health but is now hoping to add to her legacy as the most decorated gymnast of all time at this year\u2019s Olympics. So far, Biles\u2019 return has been a success, winning four gold medals and a silver at last year\u2019s world championships. In her first competition of 2024, she finished ahead of Shilese Jones and Chiles to win the all-around title at the Core Hydration Classic, leading scoring on floor and vault and placing second on the uneven bars and balance beam. Lee, meanwhile, is on her own return path to the sport having been diagnosed with kidney disease.

Chasing a seventh win in eight appearances, the world No. 1 teed off at Pennsylvania\u2019s Lancaster Country Club as the consensus tournament favorite but toiled to an opening round 10-over 80 to leave herself 12 shots off Japanese leader Yuka Saso following the first day. Having opened with a bogey, Korda \u2013 who began at the 10th hole \u2013 found the water three times en route to a septuple-bogey at the par-three 12th. The American finally cleared the creek guarding the green with her eighth shot, only to two-putt for a total of 10 strokes on the 161-yard hole. \u201cI just didn\u2019t really want to shoot 80, and I just kept making bogeys,\u201d Korda told reporters. \u201cI\u2019m human. I\u2019m going to have bad days. I played some really solid golf up to this point. Today was just a bad day. That\u2019s all I can say.\u201d Three birdies helped Korda go even-par through her closing nine holes, but the 25-year-old now faces an uphill battle to make it to the weekend, let alone lift a third major crown. \u201cNot a lot of positive thoughts, honestly,\u201d Korda, who won the Chevron Championship last month, added. \u201cI didn\u2019t hit it good. I found myself in the rough a lot. Making a 10 on a par-3 will definitely not do you any good at a US Open.\u201d \u2018The conditions are very tough\u2019 Just four players shot below par amid a blustery first round, with 22-year-old Saso\u2019s two-under 68 enough to top the leaderboard by a shot ahead of American Andrea Lee, Thailand\u2019s Wichanee Meechai and French amateur Adela Cernousek. World No. 30 Saso is chasing her second US Women\u2019s Open title after playoff triumph at The Olympic Club in San Francisco, California, in 2021. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll change anything. There\u2019s so much golf left,\u201d Saso told reporters. \u201cLike I said earlier, the golf course is very difficult and the conditions are very tough, especially with the wind swirling and when it\u2019s blowing 15 miles per hour with the firm greens and fast greens. \u201cI think just stay focused and trust the process that I\u2019ve been doing and just have fun out there.\u201d Breakthrough star Rose Zhang, the only player to beat Korda since her prolific run began in January, faired only one stroke better than her compatriot, shooting 79. The 20-year-old bested Korda at the Cognizant Classic to claim her second LPGA Tour crown earlier this month but similarly struggled, carding eight bogeys and a double-bogey at the par-five seventh. Friday\u2019s second round is set to begin at 6:45 a.m. ET (11:45 a.m. BST), with Korda scheduled to tee off among the later groups at 1:58 p.m. ET (6:58 p.m. BST).", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/sport/nelly-korda-us-womens-open-start-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_26_sport_manchester-united-erik-ten-hag-future-spt-intl", "text": "After winning a major trophy, and particularly after stunning an overwhelming favorite in the final, teams normally enjoy a period basking in that achievement and soaking in the glory. But Manchester United\u2019s celebrations after defying the odds to defeat Manchester City and win the English FA Cup on Sunday were tempered by reports that its manager Erik ten Hag would be fired, regardless of the result. When those reports were put to him after Sunday\u2019s victory, Ten Hag pointed to his trophy-winning r\u00e9sum\u00e9. \u201cIf they don\u2019t want me anymore, then I\u2019ll go anywhere else to win trophies because that is what I have done my whole career,\u201d he told reporters after the game. \u201cThe team is progressing, and we are winning trophies. Two trophies in two years is not bad,\u201d he said, referring to his team\u2019s League Cup victory last year. \u201cThree finals is not bad but we have to keep going. I\u2019m not satisfied with it.\u201d CNN has contacted Manchester United for comment about the reports that Ten Hag\u2019s future with the club is in doubt. The Dutchman has been at the club for almost two years and, despite a promising start to his tenure, presided over United\u2019s worst ever Premier League season this year as it only mustered an eighth place finish, outside qualification for European football. In the league, United\u2019s erratic performances culminated in a 4-0 loss to Crystal Palace earlier this month, which further heaped pressure on a beleaguered Ten Hag and heightened the sense of crisis around the club. Ten Hag has pointed to an injury crisis as explaining some of United\u2019s inconsistency but new investment from British petrochemical billionaire Jim Ratcliffe has increased the clamor for improvement. Before the FA Cup final on Saturday, that pessimism manifested in a sense of inevitability that United would lose, as it did last year, to an all-conquering City which had just won the Premier League. But United\u2019s teenage stars \u2013 Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo \u2013 scored in quick succession in the first half to propel the club to a 2-1 victory over City. \u201cI\u2019m in a project and we are exactly where we want to be,\u201d Ten Hag said afterwards. \u201cWe are constructing a team and when I took over, it was a mess at Man Utd. We are now on our way to constructing a team for the future. \u201cThere is still a lot of work to do but we are exactly where we are,\u201d he added afterwards. \u201cWe have value in the squad, and we have (players) with high potential who are progressing very well.\u201d One trophy-winning performance, however, may not be enough to save Ten Hag. There is precedent for United sacking a manager immediately after winning the FA Cup as the club did to Louis van Gaal in 2016, and Ten Hag still hasn\u2019t brought a sense of stability or success to United which was so dominant for so long during the 1990s and 2000s.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/26/sport/manchester-united-erik-ten-hag-future-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_sport_jadon-sancho-borussia-dortmund-exclusive-spt-intl", "text": "Borussia Dortmund star Jadon Sancho is the first to admit \u201cit\u2019s kind of crazy\u201d the way his season has panned out. The 24-year-old mercurial winger has played a key part in the German team\u2019s unlikely journey to the Champions League final after he was loaned from Manchester United in January\u00a0\u2013 with Die Schwarzgelben now on the cusp of winning their second European Cup on Saturday at Wembley Stadium. \u201cI\u2019m thankful for the team and the staff for welcoming me back. So, you know, it\u2019s a nice moment,\u201d Sancho said in an extensive, exclusive sit-down interview with CNN Senior Sport Analyst Darren Lewis in Dortmund earlier this week. \u201cTo be fair, it felt surreal. Again, it still hasn\u2019t hit me. I\u2019m sure in the next couple of days probably when we travel to London, that\u2019s when it\u2019s gonna hit me properly. \u201cI\u2019m a type of person that I don\u2019t like making new friends. I\u2019ve got a big thing on trust \u2013 it\u2019s hard for me to trust people. But I think growing up in South [London], that\u2019s what you\u2019re just taught, it\u2019s like one big family \u2026 That\u2019s why I feel like I connect so much with Dortmund. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of crazy, you know, I don\u2019t think anyone would have expected this\u00a0\u2013 me being in the Champions League final, especially where I came from. I\u2019m just happy.\u201d The final at Wembley is a homecoming for the English star. He came from humble beginnings in Camberwell, south London, and played\u00a0cage football\u00a0on the Kennington Council estate. The chance to win the biggest prize in club soccer on hallowed ground is something that motivates him, but Wembley is a place and memory that still slightly haunts him. Sancho \u2013 along with Bukayo Saka and Marcus Rashford \u2013 missed a spot-kick during the penalty shootout in the\u00a02020 European Championship\u00a0final, leading to a\u00a0barrage of racist abuse on social media following England\u2019s loss to Italy. \u201cThis is still something that\u2019s in my head sometimes. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve fully recovered yet on that part, but I\u2019m trying my best to get over that,\u201d Sancho admitted to CNN Sport. \u201cThe backlash we got from it, it wasn\u2019t nice. Being in London, not in a million years I would have thought that we would have received [that], especially representing our country. It\u2019s a memory I try to block, but, you know, I can\u2019t act like it didn\u2019t happen. So this is one of those memories that you got to try to get past it and be positive.\u201d Sancho, though, said he\u2019d still be confident taking an important penalty, pointing to one he scored for United in the\u00a0FA Cup semifinal\u00a0last season against Brighton. And he looks to be hitting form at exactly the right time. He was sensational during the semifinal clash against Paris Saint-Germain, putting on a show in front of Dortmund\u2019s famed \u201cYellow Wall\u201d in the first leg as he completed 12 dribbles. The last player to better that mark in the Champions League? Lionel Messi. \u201cTo be behind him is such an honor. What he\u2019s done in the game is outstanding,\u201d said Sancho when talking about his accomplishment. However, ask Sancho who he considers to be the greatest player of all time and he points to his former United teammate Cristiano Ronaldo, who recently became the first player to be the\u00a0top scorer in four different leagues. \u201cHe\u2019s the \u2018GOAT\u2019 (Greatest of All Time) \u2013 what can I say? He deserves it. His dedication to the game is unmatched. You know, always in the gym, always just wanting to be better,\u201d Sancho said. \u201cI had the pleasure to play with him. What a great guy he was for all the young players on the team. I learned so much from him. I\u2019m just happy that I got to assist him against Tottenham, actually, one of his goals, and he got a hat-trick. So yeah, that was definitely a dream come true. You know, just watching him, idolizing him.\u201d This weekend, Sancho will come up against old friend Jude Bellingham, who helped look after him in Germany when his fellow Englishman joined the Black and Yellow four years ago. Sancho is eager to play against the Real Madrid superstar, who was recently named\u00a0La Liga Player of the Season, and said that Bellingham is one of the best players in the world right now, alongside Vin\u00edcius Jr., Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and England captain Harry Kane. \u201cHarry Kane due to the goals he scored and I think if he\u2019d [have] won trophies this year, he would have definitely won the Ballon d\u2019Or,\u201d Sancho said of his countryman who stars for Dortmund\u2019s domestic nemesis Bayern Munich. \u201cVin\u00edcius and Jude, they are both fighting right now [to see] who can win [the Ballon d\u2019Or]. Obviously, they are very close friends, so I\u2019m not saying they are fighting, but they definitely could win it. \u201cMbapp\u00e9 has had an excellent season again, if he won [the Champions League or the European Championships], he would be in the conversation.\u201d On the widely expected and potential prospect of seeing Mbapp\u00e9 play for Los Blancos, Sancho told CNN: \u201cMbapp\u00e9 gives goals, gives assists. He\u2019s a threat to any team in the world. So, you know, to have Vin\u00edcius, Mbapp\u00e9, Bellingham and Rodrygo all on the same team \u2013 it\u2019s scary. It\u2019s very scary.\u201d While all signs point towards a European soccer dynasty forming in the Spanish capital, if Dortmund was to beat the 14-time Champions League winner and press pause on the new era, it would be the stuff of dreams for Sancho \u2013 and perhaps the most meaningful way to overwrite those painful Wembley nightmares as the England star looks set to pen the next chapter of his career.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/sport/jadon-sancho-borussia-dortmund-exclusive-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Wheelchair\u00a0tennis player Diede de Groot, though, has been unequivocally the dominant constant in the face of those challenges. \u2018Diede the Great\u2019 \u201cI feel a very big target on my back which is what keeps me motivated,\u201d De Groot told CNN ahead of the French Open. \u201cI know all of these girls are working towards beating me which is fun but intense at the same time. \u201cThey\u2019re not playing with any pressure when they\u2019re playing against me and I have all the pressure because there\u2019s this massive streak that\u2019s following me everywhere. \u201cAt the same time, I really try to forget about all of that and just play tennis.\u201d In a world where we\u2019re inundated daily with statistics ranging from the intriguing to the inane, De Groot\u2019s numbers make for truly remarkable reading. She is the first tennis player \u2013 wheelchair or able-bodied \u2013 ever to win three successive calendar grand slams. She is the first women\u2019s wheelchair tennis player to achieve the Golden Slam \u2013 all four grand slams and a Paralympic gold medal \u2013 in 2021. De Groot is also unbeaten in grand slam tournaments since the 2021 Australian Open, currently boasting a winning streak that has surpassed 130 matches. Based on facts and figures alone, one would be hard pushed to begrudge the 27-year-old for possessing the bold \u2013 yet prophetic and linguistically apt \u2013 social media handle of @DiedetheGreat. \u201cI was too humble to say Diede the Great,\u201d she says smiling. \u201cMy own last name Groot was already taken, so I had to come up with something else and then the literal translation of Groot is great. So that\u2019s how it sort of came to be. \u201cDuring the year, maybe I don\u2019t think about it [records] enough \u2026 especially in tennis because it\u2019s just like a continuous streak of tournaments. It\u2019s difficult to really take time. \u201cBut when I\u2019m just at home sitting, thinking of the amazing things that I\u2019ve already done to this point, I\u2019m very proud of myself.\u201d Wall of Champions So what\u2019s the secret of the Dutch star\u2019s success? \u201cI don\u2019t think I have the biggest serve. I don\u2019t think I have the biggest forehand,\u201d De Groot reflected. \u201cI just think that I\u2019m very good at all of the levels \u2026 I\u2019m a complete player. \u201cI don\u2019t really have a weak point and that\u2019s very difficult for opponents to, to play against.\u201d De Groot\u2019s current grand slam singles tally stands at 21. Her latest victory at this year\u2019s Australian Open was not only a remarkable 13th in a row but it also drew her level alongside the great Esther Vergeer\u2019s grand slam tally. Vergeer\u2019s 21st and final major title came at Roland Garros in 2012. Whilst De Groot still has some way to go to encroach on her compatriots astonishing 470-match unbeaten winning streak, it\u2019s fitting then that she\u2019ll have the chance to become the most successful women\u2019s wheelchair tennis player of all time at this year\u2019s French Open. Victory in Paris would consolidate De Groot\u2019s position as third in the all-time list of overall grand slam champions across singles and doubles. The 27-year-old\u2019s current tally stands at 39. Vergeer finished her career with 42 titles, second only to Japan\u2019s recently retired Shingo Kunieda, the most decorated men\u2019s player in the history of wheelchair tennis, who amassed an astonishing 50 majors. Hotbed of talent Aside from her technical prowess, the foundations of De Groot\u2019s trophy-laden career \u2013 and for that matter her compatriot Vergeer\u2019s \u2013 can also be attributed to the Dutch tennis system. It\u2019s one which allows wheelchair tennis to integrate with able-bodied players, a strategy that has worked to stunning effect. \u201cI started wheelchair tennis when I was seven years old \u2026 I had a few operations done on my hip [and] the rehabilitation center advised me: \u2018Hey, would you like tennis?\u2019 I picked it up, and I loved it straight away,\u201d said De Groot, who was born with unequal leg length. \u201cTo have that feeling that I could play tennis just like all the other kids in the group \u2026 it was very special to have that. \u201cWe are fully integrated into the KNLTB [Royal Dutch Lawn Tennis Association] program. We are treated like athletes [and] being taken seriously really helps taking yourself seriously.\u201d The KNLT\u2019s National Tennis Centre, located in Amstelveen, boasts 14 outdoor and 14 indoor courts with accessibility for wheelchair tennis. \u201cTwenty years ago wheelchair tennis was one of the biggest Paralympic sports in the Netherlands,\u201d says De Groot. \u201cWe already were very lucky to have a very good number one gold medalist [Vergeer] and because we were such a small country, we could all see each other play. \u201cAnd just learning from previous generations \u2026 I could learn from the women that went before me. I could see it from up close and therefore mimic it or even try to do better.\u201d De Groot and Vergeer both herald from the historic Dutch city of Woerden, which has produced a conveyor belt of some of the greatest players from The Netherlands to have ever graced the sport. So is there something special in the Woerden waters. \u201cWe lived very close to each other which is actually quite special,\u201d De Groot says. \u201cAnother world number one \u2013 Jiske Griffioen \u2013 also comes from there. So, it\u2019s just a coincidence \u2026 but it\u2019s a funny coincidence!\u201d \u2018We are being noticed\u2019 Wheelchair tennis events are now gradually being incorporated into a growing number of ATP and WTA events. The prestigious Miami Open hosted an event for the very first time earlier this year and Wimbledon has announced it will double the size of the wheelchair draws for this summer\u2019s tournament. \u201cI would say that from history, Paralympics were always the moment that all eyes were on us,\u201d reflected De Groot. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have to share it with able-bodied athletes. \u201cBut then for another four years, we would sort of fall to the background again \u2026 now I really feel like these players are noticing us. They\u2019re recognizing us and interacting with us more and more. \u201cI saw Jannik Sinner play with our world No. 1 Alfie Hewitt [in Miami]. Novak \u2026 he\u2019s done some really good promotion with Dylan Alcott before so hopefully these moments will be more and more \u201cCountries are developing their programs and players are developing their games. It\u2019s a really fun time to be a wheelchair tennis player.\u201d Paris 2024 When it came to the Covid-impacted Tokyo Games, the Dutch star had an unprecedented weight of history of her shoulders. Dutch women have won every wheelchair tennis title \u2013 singles and doubles \u2013 since it became a medal event 32 years ago. De Groot stormed to singles and doubles gold without dropping a set in either competition. It remains one of the defining moments of her career. \u201cFor a long time, a lot of people ask me that without gold, your career wouldn\u2019t be complete. I never thought about it that way. \u201cWinning gold in Tokyo really felt like it was like a completion of so many years already that I\u2019ve been doing so well. So many things came from winning those medals that it definitely sparked something around me, which is very good.\u201d The Dutch phenom is on track to return to the clay courts of Roland Garros to defend her titles this summer at Paris 2024. It\u2019s a challenge she\u2019s relishing and with her imperious track record to date in the French capital \u2013 winning a total of nine grand slam titles \u2013 you\u2019d be a brave person to bet against her. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a different Paralympics,\u201d she says. \u201c[I] played in Rio. I was very new there. [I] Played in Tokyo. No one was allowed to come and watch and I had all the pressure there. And now I\u2019m a defending champion with everyone there. \u201cIt will mean everything [to defend the titles]. It\u2019s the goal that I\u2019m aiming at. \u201cI still have many tournaments before so my head is not yet there, but it will be and I\u2019m going to enjoy it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/sport/diede-de-groot-tennis-unstoppable-force-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_04_29_sport_caledonian-braves-american-investors-scotland-spt-intl", "text": "Soccer is becoming firmly entrenched in mainstream pop culture with hit television shows like\u00a0\u201cTed Lasso\u201d and \u201cWelcome to Wrexham,\u201d the documentary series\u00a0detailing Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney\u2019s ownership of the Welsh soccer club, introducing the sport to new audiences in the US and abroad \u2013 as Chris Ewing is quickly discovering. On any given evening, Ewing receives emails informing him that some fan in a far-flung location \u2013 say, Los Angeles \u2013 has just invested in his tiny Scottish soccer club, the Caledonian Braves. \u201cThen 10 minutes later, there would be someone from Australia invest in the club and it\u2019s just like, \u2018Wow, I can\u2019t believe it,\u2019\u201d Ewing, the club\u2019s founder, tells CNN Sport. Nestled in the leafy outskirts of Motherwell, a town about 20 kilometers southeast of Glasgow, the Caledonian Braves play in the Scottish fifth division with a team of mostly amateur players at a ground with capacity for just 500 fans. But, despite its small home, Ewing\u2019s vision of creating a fan-owned club, steeped in values of diversity and community with ambitions of reaching the Scottish Premier League, has attracted more than $300,000 in investment from more than 1,000 owners around the world, far outstripping the annual running costs of about $58,000, he says. Among those owners include an NBA player, an NBA coach and a\u00a0players\u2019 union executive\u00a0as well as soccer players in the US\u2019 National Women Super League (NWSL). Investors in 49 US states have bought in \u2013 Wyoming is the only state pending on the list, he says. \u201cA community club, most people would think, is a local community bound by a certain geography,\u201d says Ewing. \u201cBut I think that today when we have internet, we have social media, we have an app as well that promotes fan engagement, I feel like a community can be just shared ideals and shared values, and it can be global.\u201d \u2018Entrepreneurial spirit\u2019 Visiting Scotland and learning about the country\u2019s history was an \u201camazing\u201d experience for Mujtaba Elgoodah, one of the club\u2019s lead investors, he remembers. More used to basketball than soccer, Elgoodah was the manager of team development for the Golden State Warriors when they won the 2022 NBA title and is now part of the National Basketball Players\u2019 Association executive leadership team. But, when braving the bitterly cold Scottish weather to visit the club in February, he discovered \u201cthere is nothing like a good football match,\u201d Elgoodah tells CNN Sport. \u201cJust seeing the intensity and even picking up different slang words that the crowd was throwing out there was amazing too,\u201d he adds. Elgoodah had been intrigued by the Braves\u2019 story and ethos when he happened across their story on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, last year. He set about assembling a group of investors who could appreciate both soccer\u2019s potential for growth and the importance of community alongside his longtime investment partner Nassir Criss, a serial entrepreneur and venture capitalist. Together, they involved NWSL\u2019s Kansas City Current stars Elizabeth Ball, Kristen Hamilton and Hailie Mace with their wealth of soccer knowledge, and introduced Boston Celtics performance coach Isaiah Covington to Ewing after he had also noticed the club\u2019s story on social media. \u201cI didn\u2019t grow up around soccer,\u201d Covington recalls. \u201cBut in the last few years, I have a host of nieces and nephews and that\u2019s all they play now.\u201d Though still nowhere near as popular as American football or basketball, soccer is the fastest-growing sport in the US and the most popular choice for adults under the age of 30. As a high school sport alone, it has grown by almost 300% in the last 40 years. \u201cYou see \u2026 all these celebrities owning football clubs, it\u2019s kind of the new wave that people are on,\u201d Hamilton says. \u201cAnd so I think that that\u2019s been a really huge, powerful movement in the US saying, \u2018Hey, you know, we can\u2019t own an NFL team, but we can own a small football team.\u2019\u201d With its idea for lots of small investors helping it achieve huge ambitions, the Braves embodies an American style \u201centrepreneurial spirit,\u201d Criss tells CNN Sport. \u201cHow do we take something new that no one\u2019s ever really heard of, this wee club with massive ambitions to being a global franchise and pour in resources, community, people to actually accelerate that on a very big scale,\u201d he says. \u2018Flipping the narrative\u2019 As more and more money pours into soccer, the gap between fans and owners has become a cavern at many clubs. In the battle for soccer\u2019s soul, the two groups are often pitted against each other \u2013 the fans as representing the history and traditions of the sport, the owners cast as turning clubs into commercial entities or vehicles for sportswashing. Against this backdrop, fan ownership has emerged as somewhat of a utopian panacea for some fans. While it is still an unusual model in the UK, particularly in the English Premier League and Championship where clubs operate at huge losses, the Braves are not the first to pursue this goal. They were set up as a company limited by shares in 2022 meaning that fans can buy into it, and expect to file their first set of accounts in October.\u00a0Ewing founded a previous attempt at this ownership model from 2019 to 2021 but dissolved it before ever trading, he says. In Scotland, fans have become majority owners at topflight clubs St Mirren, Motherwell and Heart of Midlothian in recent years while several others, including Rangers and Celtic, count fans among their minority owners. In German soccer culture, meanwhile, the 50+1 concept of fan majority ownership is deeply entrenched thereby giving fans more of a say in the running of clubs, a model Ewing says he hopes to eventually emulate. But fan ownership isn\u2019t easy, namely working out how to marshal hundreds of opinions into some sort of coherent opinion. Ewing, who doesn\u2019t take a salary from the club, admits that managing expectations has proved challenging \u201cbecause people think they can just say, okay, let\u2019s do x, y, z.\u201d \u201cWith the best intentions in the world, it\u2019s maybe not as easy as that, but I think as well, the big thing for me is that people get to love the highs and the lows.\u201d The Braves have an app and Discord channel, helping to foster this sense of community and allowing fan owners to have a voice on the direction of the club. Fans picked the club\u2019s name, logo and the name of its ground \u2013 Alliance Park. Allowing fans this ownership over the team is proving infectious, its investors are finding. \u201cAnytime I ever post about the Braves \u2026 people will DM me and be like, \u201c\u2019Who\u2019s this team \u2026 and how do I get involved?\u2019\u201d Ball says. Such a project is a marked difference from Ewing\u2019s original venture, Edusport Academy, which he established in 2011, intending to provide a place for promising young soccer players, mostly from France, to hone their craft and learn English. As time went by, the academy\u2019s first team started playing in the Scottish soccer leagues and separated to form the Caledonian Braves in 2019. Now, as the Braves continue to grow, it has set its sights on rising up through the leagues but in a sustainable way that preserves the club for years to come. \u201c(We\u2019re) flipping the narrative that you don\u2019t have to be Tom Brady or Matthew McConaughey or Ryan Reynolds,\u201d says Ewing. \u201cYou can be anyone really from anywhere and you can also own a football club for as little as $100.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/29/sport/caledonian-braves-american-investors-scotland-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "sports"}}

She eventually prevailed 7-6 (7-1) 1-6 7-5 on Court Philippe Chatrier, and then \u2013 unusually for a player known for her calm and reserved demeanor on the court \u2013 rebuked the crowd for distracting her during big points. \u201cI have huge respect for you guys and I know that we are playing basically for you because this is entertainment and we are also earning money because of you,\u201d \u015awi\u0105tek said in her on-court interview. \u201cBut sometimes [we\u2019re] under a lot of pressure. When you scream something during the rally or right before the return, it\u2019s really, really hard to be focused \u2026 This is serious for us, we\u2019re fighting our whole lives to be better and better and sometimes it\u2019s just hard to accept that. \u201cThe stakes are big and there\u2019s lot of money here to win. Losing a few points may change a lot. Please, guys, if you can support us between the rallies but not during, that would be really, really amazing.\u201d \u015awi\u0105tek, aiming to win a fifth grand slam title and fourth at the French Open, was cheered by the crowd as she delivered the message. It was also surprising to see so many empty seats for a high-quality encounter between a current and former world No. 1 who each have four grand slam titles. \u201cOsaka vs Swiatek is a brilliant watch,\u201d Andy Murray posted on X, adding that the sport should be doing more to promote the match. It\u2019s not the first time that the French Open crowd has come under the spotlight this week. Belgian player David Goffin said that one spectator spat chewing gum at him during his five-set victory against Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard. \u201cSoon, there will be smoke bombs, hooligans and fights in the stands,\u201d Goffin told Belgian media, per\u00a0Reuters. \u201cIt\u2019s starting to become ridiculous. Some people are there more to cause trouble than to create an atmosphere.\u201d In a statement to CNN regarding the incident, a spokesperson for the French Open said: \u201cThe public are incredibly enthusiastic, particularly on the outside courts. However, they must of course show full respect to all players while doing so. \u201cOversight bodies are in place to make sure rules are followed. Although it is only natural that fans share their excitement and cheer on their favourites, this may not in any case go against the values of tennis or consideration for the players.\u201d For her part, Osaka said that the atmosphere was \u201creally incredible\u201d for her match against Swiatek, adding that she noticed \u201chow much fun everyone in the crowd was having.\u201d The Japanese star has returned to tennis this year after the birth of her daughter, and her time away from the sport has seen her drop outside the top 100 in the world rankings.  Many expected \u015awi\u0105tek, playing on her favored surface of clay and coming off back-to-back titles in Madrid and Rome, to win comfortably against Osaka, but that was far from the truth. The Polish 22-year-old, who turns 23 on Friday, gained the upper hand in the opening set as she won 12 points in a row for a 3-1 lead before Osaka responded strongly, breaking \u015awi\u0105tek at 4-3 having trailed 40-0 earlier in the game. \u015awi\u0105tek had to save a set point at 5-4, then managed to take a commanding lead in the tie break and wrap up the first set in an hour and nine minutes. The lead was short-lived, however, as Osaka, now hitting with aggression and accuracy, broke Swiatek three times in the second set to level the match. Another break at the start of the final set put her on course for an upset victory against a player so dominant on clay, but a couple of costly misses at 5-3 \u2013 including a netted backhand on match point \u2013 saw \u015awi\u0105tek survive. The defending champion rallied from there, securing two breaks of serve and a thrilling victory in three hours and 13 minutes \u2013 despite Osaka\u2019s impressive performance featuring eight aces and 54 winners. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to have any logical thoughts because it was really intense and on a really high level,\u201d \u015awi\u0105tek told reporters. \u201cI was in huge trouble in the third set but I managed somehow to win this match.\u201d Bidding to becoming the first woman to win three consecutive French Open titles since Justine Henin in 2007, \u015awi\u0105tek will face either Croatia\u2019s Jana Fett or Czech Republic\u2019s Marie Bouzkov\u00e1 in the third round.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/sport/iga-swaitek-naomi-osaka-french-open-crowd-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Pre-match there was a sense of inevitability about the result \u2013 United had lost six of its last seven matches against City and four of its last five finals, while City was enjoying another dominant season. But United scored two first-half goals in quick succession \u2013 the first from Alejandro Garnacho, the second from Kobbie Mainoo \u2013 to rattle the Premier League champion and make this the first men\u2019s FA Cup final, according to statisticians Opta, with two teenage goalscorers. City continued to press in the second half, creating several opportunities that only brilliant goalkeeping from Andr\u00e9 Onana or the woodwork could keep out, before Jeremy Doku scored in the 87th minute, halving United\u2019s lead and setting up a frantic seven minutes of stoppage time. But United clung on to its hard-fought lead and its bench emptied onto the pitch after the final whistle to celebrate winning a trophy after an often miserable season for the historic club. Their celebrations continued as Prince William, the President of the Football Association, handed them the trophy with Prince George alongside him, watching on. \u201cIt was the last chance to get something positive from the season,\u201d captain Bruno Fernandes told the BBC afterwards. \u201cWe were here last season and we weren\u2019t good enough and we had to see them go up and get the trophy.\u201d \u201cIt is crucial for everyone. We know the manager is under so much scrutiny, he deserves this, also everyone in the backroom staff and the players, we all deserve this.\u201d A manager under pressure Rumors and reports swirled before kickoff about the fate of United manager Erik ten Hag and whether he would lose his job regardless of the FA Cup final result. After two years in the job, and a promising start, the Dutchman has so far failed to turn around United\u2019s dwindling fortunes and led the club to an eighth place finish in the Premier League this season, its lowest ever. Such a backdrop to the final echoed the one in 2016, when one of Ten Hag\u2019s predecessors, Louis van Gaal, was sacked just after he won the FA Cup final. It has been eight years since then, 11 since legendary manager Alex Ferguson retired, and still United has not rediscovered the winning formula that made it the Premier League\u2019s most dominant club in the 1990s and 2000s. Instead, it has become mired in a seemingly endless cycle of hiring and firing managers once every couple of years, a cycle that Ten Hag looks to be in danger of repeating, even after this extraordinary shock result. He cut a tense figure on the touchline, watching City dominate possession in the early exchanges, employing its usual method of wearing the opposition down through sheer force, but, this time, it could not break down the United defense. Instead, it was United who took the early lead, capitalizing on a rare City mistake when a miscommunication between Josko Gvardiol and Stefan Ortega caused Gvardiol to head the ball over his goalkeeper, leaving Garnacho a clear path to tap the ball into the net. Seven minutes later, United thought it had doubled its lead through Marcus Rashford though he was offside and the goal was disallowed, but that was no matter. It took just two more minutes for United to find the back of the net once again. Rashford floated the ball downfield from just beyond the halfway line and found Garnacho on the other wing who passed inside to Fernandes in the center of the box.The United captain delicately tapped the ball to Mainoo who made no mistake with the finish to give his side a 2-0 lead at halftime. City seemed stunned and never quite settled into its usual rhythm. Erling Haaland had an opportunity but struck the woodwork and Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez pulled a shot wide of the goal before Doku scored. But it was too little too late and City succumbed to a rare defeat, bringing the curtain down on another dominant, historic season, though this one finished with one trophy, instead of the three it won last year.

{"id": "2024_05_25_sport_scotland-soccer-religious-bigotry-intl-spt", "text": "Surrounded by medics, Hibernian FC player Martin Boyle lay on the pitch after diving for the ball in a Scottish Cup quarterfinal earlier this year and landing awkwardly on his head \u2013 the then 30-year-old suffered a concussion \u2013 an injury he would later describe as having sent him to \u201chell and back.\u201d The game was stopped for around 10 minutes, but as medics tended to the injured forward, chants of \u201cdie ya Fenian bastard\u201d sung by some fans of the opposing team Rangers FC echoed throughout the stadium in Edinburgh. Fenian refers to a group of 19th\u00a0century Irish revolutionaries but is widely recognized as a derogatory term for Irish Catholics. The language mirrors the division caused by centuries of war and strife between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, in part because of the west of Scotland\u2019s close historical links with Northern Ireland. \u201cOver recent years supporters\u2019 unacceptable conduct has become rife in Scotland whether that be through the use of pyrotechnics, sectarianism, objects being thrown onto the field of play or through other actions,\u201d Hibernian FC, commonly known as Hibs said in a statement in response to the chanting. Police Scotland told CNN it had received no reports regarding fans\u2019 behavior towards Boyle. A spokesperson added: \u201cI can confirm a man was arrested in connection with comments being made towards Rangers fans/staff, however, he was released without charge.\u201d David Scott, director of Nil by Mouth \u2013 a Scottish charity that campaigns against religious bigotry \u2013 told CNN \u201csectarianism is something that\u2019s very woven into the game of football.\u201d He explained that \u201cpassion, performance, poison\u201d are at the heart of the game in Scotland, with bigoted chanting taking the forefront. \u201cIt was a historic problem born of the Catholic-Protestant divide in Scottish society, especially in the West of Scotland. And it became greatly manifest in football,\u201d Scottish sports journalist Graham Spiers told CNN. \u201cThat in the main has meant anti-Catholic chanting. This is not anti-Protestant. It\u2019s not anti-Asian, it\u2019s not anti-Semitic. In the main, it has been about anti-Catholic and anti-Irish chanting,\u201d Spiers added. A problem rooted in history The fierce rivalry between Glasgow\u2019s two most famous teams \u2013 Celtic FC and Rangers \u2013 is historically one of the most vivid examples of sectarianism in Scottish football, and society. The two teams play each other in Saturday\u2019s Scottish Cup final. Historically chants have included anti-Catholic religious bigotry, or vocal support for paramilitary groups like the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). Celtic, founded by an Irish member of a Catholic religious order in 1887, wears its heritage proudly in the four-leaf clover of its team emblem. Meanwhile, Rangers, founded in 1872, was \u201chistorically and shamefully\u201d a mostly Protestant club until the 1980s, Spiers explained. \u201cRangers didn\u2019t hide it, they were proud of the fact they were all Protestant,\u201d he said. These historically religious identities and rivalries \u2013 often described as \u201cScotland\u2019s shame\u201d \u2013 extend to other Scottish clubs, including Edinburgh\u2019s historically Catholic Hibernian and Protestant Hearts of Midlothian FC. Perhaps the most violent chapter in the sectarian sports rivalry happened in 1995, when 16-year-old Celtic fan Mark Scott was killed by a man who police say had family links to a Protestant paramilitary group.  Scott was wearing a Celtic scarf while walking past a pub frequented by Loyalist fans on his way home from a match on the day of his murder. Jason Campbell was arrested, tried and convicted in 1996 for the killing. He was sentenced to life in prison but was freed on parole in 2011 following human rights legislation. And though Scotland has become more secular than when these clubs were founded some 150 years ago, \u201cthese tribal loyalties remain,\u201d said Nil by Mouth\u2019s Scott. \u201cWhen you\u2019re singing and chanting these things, you may think you\u2019re just thinking about your tradition, your background, but actually other people may just hear the hatred and agonism,\u201d said Scott. \u201cAcross the city, people will sing songs, \u2018We\u2019re up to our knees in Fenian blood, surrender or you\u2019ll die.\u2019 \u201cThey will tell you that, \u2018This is just theater, these are just words that don\u2019t mean anything, these are football chants,\u2019 that people like me are taking it too seriously. It\u2019s all culture. But it can also be a very intimidating atmosphere to be at,\u201d Scott added. According to Spiers, Celtic\u2019s support is \u201cmaybe 70% Catholic, but with a very large Protestant minority, who are Celtic fans. And they also have songs about \u2018Orange [named after King William III, also known as William of Orange and a political society] bastards,\u2019 meaning Protestants.\u201d Geographically, these are clubs whose support cuts across the geography of Scotland as well as social class, said Scott. \u201cPeople don\u2019t go to church anymore,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople don\u2019t live in these kinds of working class communities in Scotland where they used to do \u2013 people are more spread out. I think football becomes this kind of social cement that links people to parts of their past.\u201d Authorities have tried to tackle the problem, introducing legislation including The Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Act 2012, which was repealed in 2018. \u201cIf you\u2019re watching football matches with five or 10,000 people or whatever it is shouting and chanting, you can\u2019t arrest them. So you have to come up with a system of addressing that,\u201d Scott explained. There were 576 charges with a religious aggravation reported in 2022-23 according to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS), an 8% increase on the previous 12 months. The COPFS reports that \u201cover the last five years, the number of religious charges reported has fluctuated between around 530 and 670 per year.\u201d This April, Scotland\u2019s new hate crime law came into force, which focuses on \u201cstirring up hatred,\u201d \u201cracially aggravated harassment\u201d and crimes \u201caggravated by prejudice\u201d with regard to age, disability, impairment, religion, sexual orientation, transgender identity and sex characteristics \u2013 though Scott describes this law as a \u201cred herring\u201d when it comes to addressing bigotry in football given previous legislation\u00a0didn\u2019t solve the problem. A spokesperson for the Scottish Government told CNN that it is \u201cfully committed to tackling all forms of bigotry and prejudice including sectarianism.\u201d The spokesperson highlighted the new Hate Crime and Public Order Act as a mechanism to tackle hatred and prejudice, and said the government would support the police in \u201ctaking appropriate and proportionate action to safeguard public safety.\u201d Joseph Webster, Professor of the Anthropology of Religion at the University of Cambridge, told CNN that his own research shows that the majority of \u201coffensive chanting\u201d occurs when only one fan group is present, in spaces like a social club or pub, and can \u201cfoster intra-group solidarity.\u201d Webster added that his research shows an unintended consequence of the now defunct Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Act 2012 \u201cis that those fan bases feel unfairly targeted by the police, and the result is they look inward, among themselves even further, and the chanting then escalates.\u201d CNN has reached out to Police Scotland, Scottish Football Association, Rangers and Celtic for comment. Hiding a wider problem Jeanette Findlay, the Chair, and a founding member of Call it Out, a campaign against anti-Irish racism and anti-Catholic bigotry, said that outrage over anti-Catholic chanting in football is \u201ca long running diversion by the Scottish government, Scottish society.\u201d \u201cThe Scottish government and polite Scottish society don\u2019t like to acknowledge that there is, across Scottish society, geographically and in class terms, a continued anti-Catholic bigotry,\u201d she told CNN Sport, explaining that the vast majority of Catholics in Scotland are of Irish descent. The Scottish Government referred CNN to its previous statement when asked about these claims. Findlay says that the government often comments that the problem is contained to football, and by association, areas lived in by the working class. \u201cCatholics are more likely to live in poorer areas, they are over represented in the prison system, hugely overrepresented in religious aggravated hate crime. We are over represented in certain health conditions,\u201d she added. Scottish government data backs up those observations of Findlay. In almost half of religion aggravated hate crimes, \u201cthe perpetrator showed prejudice towards the Catholic community\u201d (47%), according to a Police Scotland report which reviewed recorded crimes in 2020-21. The next largest groups were Muslims and Protestants, who each made up 16% of cases, the report data based on a random sample of cases, found. In 2022-23, police noted that around one in 10 hate crimes were religiously aggravated, though this data set did not disclose which religions were targeted. Findlay said that, while she has heard hostile chants at football matches, \u201cfrankly, I\u2019m more concerned with the employment statistics, and the justice statistics and the health statistics which are more of a problem for us.\u201d \u201cSomeone calling us a Fenian bastard and threatening us on a football pitch doesn\u2019t cause us much trouble. \u201cIf they were marching past places of worship, spitting on our priests and vandalizing our churches, that\u2019s a problem. If they were standing at the door, shouting up, that should be dealt with,\u201d she added. Journalist Spiers said that, although Rangers \u201cmodernized\u201d long ago following pressure from fans and the media, prejudicial songs and their associated meanings \u201cstill hangs around Rangers like a bad stench.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019ve been at Rangers games in recent years where the atmosphere has been great \u2013 nobody is more sensitive than I am to chanting because God knows I\u2019ve written about it for 25 years.\u201d But \u201cevery so often, it will flare up and we all go. \u2018All right. It\u2019s still there. The old problem is still there.\u2019 But it\u2019s not as regular as it was 10, 20, 30, 40 years ago\u201d Spiers added. \u201cPeople find it tedious and boring and tragic. I\u2019m not actually offended by these chants, but I\u2019m embarrassed for my country. I\u2019m embarrassed for Scotland, that people will say \u2013 why are they singing about Catholics, you know, as if it\u2019s as if it\u2019s the 1920s or the 1890s?\u201d Webster is one of many who cautions against relying on legislation alone to deal with bigotry, adding: \u201cI think most people would agree that you can\u2019t prevent someone from holding bigoted attitudes by arresting them.\u201d Celtic recently won the Scottish Premiership, edging Rangers to the title. Saturday\u2019s cup final offers Rangers a chance to stop its rival from winning the double, but given the clubs\u2019 complicated history, how their respective fanbases behave will also be closely watched.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/sport/scotland-soccer-religious-bigotry-intl-spt/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_sport_negro-league-stats-mlb-record-books-intl-spt", "text": "Have you ever heard something on the news and responded by saying \u201cit\u2019s about darn time?\u201d That\u2019s how I felt when I heard about the integration of Negro League Baseball (NLB) statistics from 1920-1948 into Major League Baseball\u2019s (MLB) record books. This move doesn\u2019t somehow \u201cerase the years of injustice,\u201d as the documentary \u201cWhen It Was A Game\u201d put it. Rather, including NLB statistics in the MLB ones \u201cserve[s] to remind us of what we missed\u201d by having racially segregated leagues. Indeed, as elite sportswriter Neil Paine pointed out to me, it\u2019s the stats that show us that the NLB was the equal of, if not superior to, its White counterpart. Consider the statistics of when nine White major leaguers from various teams \u2013 who came together under the banner of \u201call-star\u201d teams \u2013 played against teams of Black major leaguers. The NLB players won 51% of the time from 1900 to 1948. This isn\u2019t some statistical fluke, either. We have 180 documented games during this stretch, which is the equivalent of over one season of major league games (162 currently) or more than 25 World Series taken to the maximum of seven games. As Negro League historian Todd Peterson noted when he made his case a few years ago, the Negro Leaguers were the only ones to consistently beat White major leaguers, who dominated squads of semi-pro, college and minor leaguers. The games between White MLB stars and NLB players left a lasting mark on Hall of Famer Dizzy Dean, who had organized a lot of games between White \u201call-stars\u201d and Negro League players. Dean had great respect for the skills of arguably the Negro League\u2019s best pitcher, Satchel Paige, after Dean\u2019s team of White ball players fell to NLB teams on numerous occasions. While players like Paige eventually did join an integrated MLB, he was well past his prime. Fortunately, we got to see other NLB players join an integrated MLB a short time into their careers. Willie Mays was the best player of the second half of the 20th century, according to the all-encompassing stat wins above replacement (WAR); Mays was a member of NLB\u2019s Birmingham Black Barons in 1948. Henry \u201cHank\u201d Aaron was the second-best player, according to WAR, of the second half of the 20th century. The 20th century home run king was a member of the NLB\u2019s Indianapolis Clowns in 1952, after the period where NLB teams were considered major league for stat counting purposes. High-level players and deserved accolades It\u2019s depressing to imagine a world where Mays or Aaron didn\u2019t play in the integrated major leagues, which is true for Black players overall. They quickly became an integral part of the American and National Leagues in the late 1940s, 50s, 60s and 70s. Black players were on average the best players, which adds to the case that the NLB was a major league. Former NLB players who joined the integrated MLB got on base more frequently (.361) than the average (.324). They hit for more power too with a higher slugging percentage (.455) than the average (.380). The same dominance of former NLB players held true for pitching in the integrated MLB. They won more games (55%) than the average major leaguer (50%), gave up fewer runs (with an ERA of 3.76 vs. 3.91) and struck out more players per nine innings (5.91 vs. 4.89). It\u2019s not surprising that the second former NLB player to win Rookie of the Year in the integrated major leagues was pitcher Don Newcombe. In fact, former NLB players won the National League Rookie of the Year every year from 1949 to 1953. The first MLB player to win Rookie of the Year in the integrated league was Jackie Robinson. Sometimes lost in all of the deserved accolades of Robinson\u2019s breaking the color barrier in 1947 was just how good he was as a player in the integrated league. He put together seven of the best seasons ever for a guy who primarily played second base, according to WAR. Robinson did this while not playing a single integrated MLB game until he was 28, when many players\u2019 skills are already declining. Players like Robinson and Larry Doby \u2013 the first American League Black player and Hall of Famer \u2013 were able to perform at a high level, despite having to put up with a lot of racist rhetoric from fans and fellow players. Sadly, some NLB stars never got to play in an integrated MLB: catcher Josh Gibson was one of them. He died before Robinson ever took the field for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. With Wednesday\u2019s news, Gibson\u2019s now credited with being the all-time baseball leader in batting average at .372 and power hitting (with a slugging percentage of .718). Gibson also leads in on-base-plus-slugging (OBPS) at 1.177, which combines getting on base and hitting for power. Ty Cobb had led the first category, while Babe Ruth led the second and the third. Gibson\u2019s great grandson put it best when he told CNN that \u201cnow, the conversation begins where Josh Gibson ranks as the greatest of all time or one of the greatest of all time.\u201d It\u2019ll be a fun debate to compare the power hitting of Gibson and Ruth. We\u2019ll never know how Ruth would have batted if Black players were part of the American League, or how Gibson would have done in regular season competition against White players. But what\u2019s interesting about the MLB is that it was already combining records for two totally different leagues prior to adding the NLB to the record books. The American League (of which Doby was part of) and National League (of which Robinson was part of) didn\u2019t play regular season games against each other until 1997. Cobb never played against a NL squad in the regular season. Ruth only did for well less than half a season, after he was well past his prime. In fact, if you were to look at the leaderboard for White MLB stats prior to integration, you\u2019ll see many players never played the opposing league in the regular season. NL pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander never played against the AL. AL pitcher Walter Johnson never played against the NL. A big reason for that is that it was basically impossible for the AL and NL teams to trade players to each other prior to 1959. The leagues were so distinct that they had different presidents just like the NLB. What today\u2019s MLB did in combining the records of the different leagues \u2013 the AL, NL and NLB \u2013 makes sense and has precedent to some degree. When people look at MLB stats now, they\u2019ll get a truer picture of who was good, great or transcendent, regardless of which league they played in.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/sport/negro-league-stats-mlb-record-books-intl-spt/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "sports"}}

The Olympiacos fans at that end of the Agia Sophia Stadium, the home of rival club AEK Athens, erupted but they were made to put their initial celebrations on ice until a long, nerve-racking VAR check finally confirmed the goal. It was a case of heart-breaking d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for Fiorentina, which was undefeated in this season\u2019s tournament, after losing last year\u2019s Conference League final to West Ham. \u201cFirst [European title] for Olympiacos and first for me,\u201d striker Stefan Jovetic, a former Fiorentina player, told TNT Sports. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of my guys.

It\u2019s a shame for them, they gave their best and I wish them all the best. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if it [the VAR check] was for a foul or for offside, I was not sure, but when he said offside, I knew it was a goal.\u201d Jovetic said he \u201ccan\u2019t wait\u201d to get back to the \u201camazing\u201d celebrations that were happening less than 20 kilometers down the road in Piraeus, the port city south of Athens where Olympiacos is based.

Olympiacos\u2019 Spanish head coach, Jose Luis Mendilibar, has now won back-to-back European trophies after leading Sevilla to the Europa League title last season. The victory marks an impressive turnaround for Mendilibar, who was the third manager hired by Olympiacos this season after the team endured a difficult start to the campaign. That Olympiacos would even be in the final seemed unlikely just a few weeks ago after the team lost 4-1 at home to Maccabi Tel Aviv in the round of 16, but an impressive 6-1 win in the second leg turned the tie around. Olympiacos followed up that win with an even more impressive penalty shootout victory away to Fenerbahce in a famously hostile atmosphere, before getting the better of Aston Villa in the semifinals. El Kaabi was the hero then, too, scoring five goals across the two legs against the Premier League side. The Moroccan finishes as the tournament\u2019s top goalscorer with 11 goals in nine games, taking his tally for the season to 33 goals in 50 games across all competitions.

{"id": "2023_10_30_sport_enhanced-games-olympics-doping-spt-intl", "text": "The 2024 Olympics are fast approaching and as athletes gear up for one of the world\u2019s most prestigious sporting events, one entrepreneur has a different idea of what \u201cfaster, higher, stronger\u201d \u2013 the former motto of the Games \u2013 might represent. The Enhanced Games says it is an \u201calternative\u201d to what it calls the \u201ccorrupt Olympics Games.\u201d Athletes competing at the Enhanced Games will be free to use performance-enhancing drugs, they won\u2019t be tested and will be under no obligation to declare which substances they have taken in order to compete. That\u2019s quite a contrast to the Olympics\u2019 doping protocols. The International Testing Agency (ITA) will be responsible for looking after Paris 2024\u2019s anti-doping program. Six years ago, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which oversees the Olympics, delegated its entire clean sport program to the ITA. However, historically the Olympic Games have been dogged by a series of doping and kickback scandals. When approached for comment on the Enhanced Games and allegations of corruption, the IOC told CNN Sport that \u201cthe idea does not merit any comment.\u201d \u2018Danger to health, to sport\u2019 CNN Sport interviewed a number of experts in the field of doping for this story, who expressed concern that the Enhanced Games was an extremely dangerous proposition. Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, who exposed Russia\u2019s state-sponsored doping program \u2013 a massive, years-long effort which benefited more than 1,000 athletes between 2011 and 2015 \u2013 said that the Enhanced Games is a \u201cdanger to health, to sport.\u201d Whether the Enhanced Games will ever take place remains an open question, but the very idea is drawing considerable blowback from leading anti-doping officials and sporting organizations. The Enhanced Games is the brainchild of businessman Aron D\u2019Souza. He is also the founding editor of \u201cThe Journal Jurisprudence,\u201d a quarterly publication on legal philosophy, according to his website, which also describes him as an \u201cavid athlete.\u201d Recently, D\u2019Souza told CNN Sport he has \u201csigned term sheets with prominent venture capital firms\u201d in relation to the Enhanced Games and is \u201cwaiting on the lawyers to finish long-form drafting.\u201d He also said that a funding announcement is planned for early December. Although not legally binding, term sheets are a serious expression of intent by both sides, setting out the broad principles of an agreement. D\u2019Souza believes what he calls a \u201cscience-driven\u201d competition is the next step in the evolution of sport, suggesting that the absence of drug testing will level the playing field. According to a 2020 study from Raphael Faiss, Research Manager at the centre of Research and Expertise in anti-doping sciences at the University of Lausanne, data from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) suggests less than 2% of athletes dope. However, Faiss told CNN Sport the number of athletes taking performance-enhancing drugs is likely significantly higher; his research, based on two international major athletic events in 2011 and 2013, suggests the figure could be between 15 to 18%. Faiss and his team compared athletes\u2019 blood results collected by WADA-accredited labs to values from healthy adults, as well as doped and undoped athletes; the closer the values are to those of subjects to whom erythropoietin (EPO, which is used in blood doping) had been administered, the higher the chances that they\u2019re actually doping. This analysis, Faiss said, is not proof of doping, but is a \u201crobust way\u201d of analyzing the data, allowing scientists to make an estimate for doping prevalence, as well as targeting athletes most likely to be doping. In written comments to CNN Sport, WADA said: \u201cDetermining the level of [doping] prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed,\u201d explaining that, since 2017, a \u201cprevalence working group\u201d has been established to \u201cdetermine if strategies, reliable methods and tools can be developed to adequately assess the prevalence of doping in sports.\u201d WADA told CNN Sport that the group has delivered \u201cseveral recommendations and guidance to WADA but not the final ones yet.\u201d WADA has reservations about Faiss\u2019 study and pointed to the \u201ccomplexity of trying to measure [doping] prevalence,\u201d highlighting that reports have \u201cgreatly varying results.\u201d The anti-doping organization added: \u201cNo single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline.\u201d \u201cComparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system\u2019s testing figures isn\u2019t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence. \u201cIn any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries \u2013 it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others. \u201cThe Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures.\u201d Editor\u2019s note: You can find WADA\u2019s full statement at the bottom of this article.\u00a0 \u2018A dangerous clown show\u2019 Travis Tygart, the Chief Executive Officer at the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), told CNN Sport that the idea of an Enhanced Games is \u201cfarcical \u2026 likely illegal in many [US] states\u201d and \u201ca dangerous clown show, not real sport.\u201d Substances such as anabolic steroids \u2013 which help to build muscle mass by enabling athletes to train harder and recover quickly from strenuous workouts \u2013 are classified as a Schedule III drug by the US Drug Enforcement Administration. When asked whether anabolic steroids will be allowed at the games and whether athletes would be tested for illegal drugs such as cocaine, D\u2019Souza told CNN Sport that \u201cwe will not be drug testing at the games.\u201d He added: \u201cWe do not propose to regulate what athletes use.\u201d Anabolic steroids may be prescribed by a licensed physician for the treatment of certain conditions such as testosterone deficiency, but if used in the US without a prescription from a licensed physician, a first conviction could result in a one-year prison sentence and a $1,000 fine. But that isn\u2019t the only potential legal jeopardy the Enhanced Games faces, according to American lawyer Jim Walden, who represents Russian whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov. \u201cIf you look at the Enhanced Games website, it\u2019s almost as though they\u2019re advertising their disregard of the law,\u201d Walden told CNN Sport. \u201cThey wrap themselves up in what I will call the cloak of legitimacy by using phrases like body autonomy and coming out as an enhanced athlete. \u201cI hope they\u2019re thinking hard about how they\u2019re going to pull this off in the world in which the FBI has a specific unit that is called the Sports and Gaming Initiative that\u2019s focusing on these very issues.\u201d The Sports and Gaming Initiative was developed to \u201cprotect athletes and sporting institutions in the United States from criminal threats and influences,\u201d according to the government website. The initiative works in partnership with sports leagues and governing bodies, international law enforcement and independent watchdog groups to tackle crimes such as fraud, doping and match-fixing; criminal activities, it says, \u201cdegrade the integrity of sports and competition and erode public confidence in these cherished institutions.\u201d \u201cThe use of doping substances is not acceptable in modern sports,\u201d Rodchenkov said in his written comments to CNN. \u201cPromotion and advertising of banned substances is against sport rules and moral, letter and spirit. \u201cIt might bring an extreme harm to young generation[s] of athletes who mistakenly could believe in benefits of [the] Enhanced Games.\u201d Rodchenkov, the protagonist of the Oscar-winning Netflix documentary Icarus who is currently under FBI protection, also believes that the Enhanced Games\u2019 organizers \u201cmight get investigated [\u2026] under the Rodchenkov Act.\u201d The Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act, named after the whistleblower, allows the US to impose criminal sanctions on individuals involved in doping activities at international events. However, the Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act does not apply to sporting events that don\u2019t adopt the WADA code, which the Enhanced Games wouldn\u2019t do. Rodchenkov also added that WADA athletes could not have any affiliation or contact with so-called enhanced athletes, or they would risk being charged under Article 2.10 \u2013 \u201cProhibited Association by an Athlete or Other Person\u201d \u2013 of the World Anti-Doping Code. USADA\u2019s Tygart also told CNN Sport: \u201cNo one really wants our children growing up idolizing unbridled drug use in sport, even if some profiteers think otherwise.\u201d D\u2019Souza insists his motivation for founding the Enhanced Games isn\u2019t financial. If he had wanted to make more money, he says he\u2019d continue to be a \u201cquiet, mild-mannered venture capitalist.\u201d \u201cI do think fundamentally that consumers want this [the Enhanced Games] and athletes want this because if you go to the cinemas, no one\u2019s interested in histories in the past anymore,\u201d said D\u2019Souza. \u201cThey\u2019re interested in superheroes and technology in the future. And this is literally what we are bringing to a reality.\u201d \u2018The dirtiest Olympics in history\u2019 According to Pierre de Coubertin \u2013 the founder of the modern Olympics \u2013 \u201cfor every man, woman and child, it [sport] offers an opportunity for self-improvement.\u201d Except historically, many athletes competing in the Olympics have taken the idea of self-improvement too far, notably at London 2012, which Rodchenkov has previously called \u201cthe dirtiest Olympics in history.\u201d When the ITA concluded its re-analysis program for the London Games, it found 73 anti-doping rule violations, which led to the withdrawal of 31 medals and reallocation of 46 Olympic medals across the sports of athletics, weightlifting, wrestling and canoeing. Doping has been an issue at the Olympics throughout the event\u2019s history, and the 100-meter final at the 1988 Games has become one of the most infamous and controversial moments in sporting history. Six of the eight finalists \u2013 notably the winner, Ben Johnson \u2013 who lined up on that September day in Seoul 35 years ago would fail drug tests themselves or be implicated in drug use during their careers. Despite some athletes continuing to cheat, global antidoping efforts remain ever-present, according to the testers. Recent out-of-competition (OOC) testing data published by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) highlights positive results from steps being taken to keep \u201celite podiums and finals clean,\u201d according to the anti-doping organization. Data focused on OOC testing ahead of last year\u2019s World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon, shows how resources and testing are targeting those athletes most likely to win medals and make finals. Whilst only 39% of the athletes in Eugene had three or more OOC tests in the 10 months leading up the event, 81% of top-eight finishers had three or more OOC tests. Yet the cat and mouse game between testers and athletes using banned substances continues. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly about the question of timing and targeting the right athletes,\u201d said Faiss. Given that athletes have their blood values regularly monitored, it is \u201cgetting more difficult for athletes to use high doses [of drugs such as EPO], but they would still be using micro dosing.\u201d By taking EPO late at night and drinking enough water, the substance would not be detected in athletes the following morning, according to Faiss, though athletes suspected of blood doping could be tested in the middle of the night. \u201cAthletes are actually getting back to very simple ways of doping with steroids,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cEPO is quite simple to use, but still tricky to detect.\u201d Athletes \u201cuse the drugs that are actively working.\u201d When it comes to new substances such as Roxadustat \u2013 the drug that two-time grand slam champion Simona Halep has recently been given a four-year ban for taking, although she denies ever knowingly or intentionally taking any prohibited substance \u2013 Faiss said athletes \u201care likely to use substances with a very short half-life in [the] body that are mimicking processes of the oxygen carrying improvements through the EPO channels.\u201d Roxadustat has an elimination half-life of 10-16 hours, according to the National Institutes of Health. Athletes are \u201cseeking to find substances where the [half-life] time window is very short, to make sure that if they are not tested at the right moment, they won\u2019t be caught,\u201d said Faiss. \u2018Challenge for sporting competition\u2019 Michele Verroken, the founding director of consultancy group Sporting Integrity, believes an antidoping system is required that will \u201cgive a lot more credibility, a lot more immediacy to verifying results, if we\u2019re going to keep the hearts and minds of athletes.\u201d Verroken also questions what\u2019s stopping an athlete from cheating if they only get caught 10 years after the event, or not at all. Under the World Anti-Doping Code, there is a 10-year statute of limitations on samples taken from 2015 onwards. Verroken told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games is \u201csetting a really interesting challenge for sporting competition.\u201d Not unsurprisingly, many sporting bodies have condemned the event. The Australian Olympic Committee called it \u201cdangerous and irresponsible,\u201d saying that \u201cthe world needs better than this.\u201d UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) said it \u201cis extremely concerned by the concept of an Enhanced Games,\u201d adding that \u201cthere is no place in sport for performance enhancing drugs, nor the Enhanced Games.\u201d UKAD\u2019s Director of Operations, Hamish Coffey, told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games sets a \u201chugely dangerous precedent,\u201d expressing concern over the kind of messaging the event sends to the next generation of athletes. \u2018Very accomplished athletes\u2019 When CNN Sport spoke to D\u2019Souza shortly after the proposed event\u2019s announcement, he said that 368 athletes had enquired about the Enhanced Games and more had messaged via social media. The organization\u2019s Chief Athletes Officer and former Olympian Brett Fraser, who swam for the Cayman Islands at three Olympic Games, told CNN Sport that \u201cvery accomplished athletes\u201d at the level of Olympic finalists have reached out \u201cto understand more about how the first Games will take place and how they can become involved.\u201d Fraser added that Enhanced Games organizers \u201calready have an Olympic medallist\u201d for their athlete commission, though he didn\u2019t specify who that was. He also said there has been \u201ca lot of positive feedback and a lot of acceptance and excitement from younger generations.\u201d Nonetheless, none of the athletes appear prepared to speak publicly at this stage. For those who do want to compete, the Enhanced Games would be an annual event with five categories \u2013 track and field, swimming, weightlifting, gymnastics and martial arts. The huge cost of hosting an Olympic Games is no secret, with countries often striving to create bigger and better spectacles by blowing their budget. Tokyo 2021 had the largest Olympic sports program in history, with 33 sports competitions in 42 venues culminating in 339 medal events. The Covid-impacted Games were delivered with a final expenditure of $13 billion \u2013 almost double the $7.3 billion that was originally forecast. Meanwhile, keeping the IOC\u2019s philosophy of \u201clower-impact Games\u201d in mind, 95% of venues will be pre-existing facilities at the Paris 2024 Olympics. D\u2019Souza said the Enhanced Games will focus on fewer sports, reuse existing infrastructure and fund the event through the private sector to \u201cdeliver a high-impact yet cost-efficient games\u201d so profits can be shared with the athletes. He added that the Enhanced Games is looking for a seven-figure prize pool for any athlete potentially breaking Usain Bolt\u2019s 100-meter world record of 9.58 seconds. \u201cI\u2019ve had conversations with people who are top-10 sprinters in the world who are going to the next Olympics, and they said [\u2026] if there\u2019s a million-dollar prize to break the 100m world record, I\u2019ll be there,\u201d said D\u2019Souza. Universal basic income and mental health support to athletes will also be part of an \u201cenhanced athletes programme.\u201d When asked who would take responsibility if an athlete competing at the Enhanced Games were to suffer fatal consequences, D\u2019Souza told CNN Sport that \u201cour athletes at the games will be the most monitored athletes in history.\u201d He said: \u201cWe will focus on athlete safety by mandating athletes have pre-competition full-system clinical screenings including blood tests and EKGs.\u201d \u201cThis will ensure that athletes are healthy to complete and not at risk of major health complications.\u201d D\u2019Souza also said that athletes will sign waivers in order\u00a0to compete. As it stands, no venues are officially in place to host the event and D\u2019Souza admits its scale will be dependent on funding and media partnerships. \u201cWe\u2019re in commercial negotiations with venues and media partners at the moment,\u201d added D\u2019Souza, who said the first Enhanced Games will be at a university campus or a similar facility in the south of the US and that a number of trademarks have been filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. \u2018Undermine the very purpose of sport\u2019 Elite performance coach Trevor Painter, who has worked with a number of Olympic and international sprinters and middle-distance runners, said he would \u201cnever\u201d coach an athlete taking performance-enhancing drugs because it would go against his morals as a coach. \u201cHaving been involved with many athletes that have lost in many ways to the cheats, I won\u2019t be engaging with [the Enhanced Games],\u201d Painter told CNN Sport. If it goes ahead as planned in December 2024, D\u2019Souza insists that the Enhanced Games will unlock the potential of humanity. But according to John William Devine, Senior Lecturer in Ethics, Sport and Exercise Sciences at Swansea University in Wales, the Enhanced Games will make sporting competition more unfair than it already is and even \u201cundermine the very purpose of the sport in question.\u201d Devine told CNN Sport that \u201cperformance-enhancing drugs don\u2019t actually lead to better athletic performance. They obscure athletic performance.\u201d He added that, although the Enhanced Games may look very similar to the Olympics, the nature of the activity will be different, raising the question: \u201cTo what extent is drug-assisted performance reflective of the athletes\u2019 sporting excellence?\u201d WADA response in full: Determining the level of prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed. That is why we set up a\u00a0Working Group on Doping Prevalence\u00a0in 2017. Measuring doping prevalence is a difficult and complex process. Through its work, the group found a huge variance across the many prevalence studies that have been carried out, leading it to publish guidelines on how to improve the quality of measuring prevalence. WADA is currently developing a tool that Anti-Doping Organizations can use to evaluate the effectiveness of their programs. WADA is well aware of the [Faiss] study. Indeed, one of the contributors, Prof. Martial Saugy, is a member of the Working Group. This study is one of many that helps to inform the Group\u2019s work. It is a very narrow study. It looks at two events, in a single sport, held 10 and 12 years ago, using just one method of measurement (the Athlete Biological Passport (ABP)). As far as I am aware, there is no comparable data from more recent World Championships in the same sport. Given its limited scope, it is important that this study be analyzed within the wider context of other studies and not be taken in isolation. This study also highlights the complexity of trying to measure prevalence. It is the third published paper that sought to measure prevalence at the 2011 Athletics World Championships. Each reported greatly varying results. The fact is no single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline. Results will always come with caveats and margins of error and will be based on a variety of methods, including self-report questionnaires, analytical methods (like ABP and testing data) and other methods to give a more rounded estimate of what the most likely figure would be. Comparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system\u2019s testing figures isn\u2019t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence. In any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries \u2013 it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others. The Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/10/30/sport/enhanced-games-olympics-doping-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2022_07_25_sport_black-representation-swimming-equality-spt-intl", "text": "Omie Dale has fond memories of splashing in the sea as a child, of racing through water parks and swimming in backwaters and rivers.   \u201cThere\u2019s so much joy that can be had once you learn to swim, once you\u2019ve abandoned those fears and you can get in the water,\u201d the 25-year-old Dale, who is based in southeast London, tells CNN Sport.  Even though swimming is a joyful experience for Dale, the stark reality is that many Black communities in Britain and the US do not have safe access to swimming lessons and public pools due to historic racism and segregation \u2013 a problem that is especially alarming given that, as Dale says, it is \u201cthe only sport that can save your life.\u201d  A history of exclusion The lack of access afforded to Black communities in Britain is what motivated Dale to become a swimming teacher in September 2019.  \u201cI used to work in Kensington (in London) as a lifeguard and some of the richest people live in that borough, but also some of the poorest,\u201d she says. She saw there was a difference when private schools and independent schools would come in and all the kids were able to swim, yet hardly any children of the same age that Dale saw from state schools could swim 25 meters.  \u201cThere\u2019s a real class barrier in the sport of swimming,\u201d Dale adds.   She is a director of Swimunity, a collective offering free swimming lessons to women and children in North Kensington, West London. It was born in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster in 2017, when a residential block caught on fire, killing 72 people \u2013 and leaving many more without homes.   \u201cThere\u2019s like a lot of people who come to swim lessons \u2026 who have undergone some form of trauma, whether that be water-related trauma or trauma related to their everyday lives,\u201d Dale says.   \u201cMany people say it\u2019s like an escape from their daily lives or is, actually, the first time that they\u2019ve taken time for themselves.\u201d  While 77% of children from the most affluent families in England can swim 25 meters unaided, only 34% from the least affluent families can, according to a 2021 survey from Sport England, a non-departmental public body that fosters grassroots sports in England.  About 95% of Black adults and 80% of Black children in England do not regularly participate in swimming, according to Sport England\u2019s report, published in January 2020. Likewise, about 93% of Asian adults and 78% of Asian children, including those with Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi heritage, do not regularly participate in swimming, the same research found. This trend extends to the US, where nearly 64% of Black children have \u201clow\u201d or no ability to swim, compared with 40% of their White peers, according to 2017 data from the country\u2019s national governing body for the sport at a competitive level, USA Swimming.   The underrepresentation of Black people in the pool in the US can be traced back to the early 20th century.   Public swimming pools became popular in North America in the 1920s and 30s and were initially open to all. However, Northern politicians stipulated a \u201cWhites Only\u201d rule, referencing racist fears about Black men fraternizing with White women.   Even after legal racial segregation ended in the US in 1964, public pools continued to be hostile environments. As people of color began to use public pools, White swimmers retreated to the privacy of their own pools and private clubs, where expensive fees continue to be an economic barrier for Black families who cannot afford the cost.    Similar examples in Britain illustrate how racial and class inequalities lead to the systemic exclusion of Black people in pools. For example, more than 4.2 million people in the UK live in ethnically diverse communities where Covid-19 national lockdowns resulted in the closure or mothballing of pools, according to Swim England \u2013 England\u2019s national swimming governing body \u2013 and the Black Swimming Association (BSA), a UK-based charity that aims to encourage more African, Caribbean and Asian communities to take up swimming.  \u2018We cannot keep recovering bodies\u2019  Globally, drowning is the third leading cause of accidental injury-related death and at least 236,000 people die each year from drowning, according to 2019 data from the World Health Organization (WHO). Children are particularly affected, with drowning being one of the top five causes of death for those aged 1-14 years in 48 of 85 countries studied by the WHO.   And while natural disasters and irregular migration are notorious risk factors, so are lower socioeconomic status, lack of higher education and being a member of an ethnic minority, depending on the country, WHO research shows.  \u201cMost drowning incidents happen when people never intend to get into the water in the first place,\u201d says Dale, who was awarded Swim Teacher of the Year by Swim England in 2021.  In December 2019, three members of the same Black British family \u2013 a 53-year-old father and his two children \u2013 died in a swimming pool at a resort in Costa del Sol, Spain, Reuters reported. The father and his 16-year-old son had reportedly leapt into the water to try to save his nine-year-old daughter, who was drowning.   Danielle Obe is the co-founder and chair of the BSA. She told CNN Sport that the Costa del Sol deaths prompted her to establish the BSA in March 2020, alongside Olympic swimmer Alice Dearing, journalist Seren Jones and songwriter, rapper and producer Ed Accura.    \u201cThis was devastating because these families were actually acquainted to me and they were from my local community,\u201d Obe says. \u201c(At) that point, I called Alice and Seren, and I said, \u2018We\u2019ve been talking about doing something for our community. We\u2019ve got to do something. We\u2019ve got to do it now. We cannot keep recovering bodies.\u2019\u201d   \u201cIt\u2019s no longer just about that lack of representation,\u201d Obe adds.   \u201cIt\u2019s now about saving lives, vital water safety, education for all. Swimming is an intervention. Swimming is a life skill.\u201d  However, there is still a lack of data when it comes to drowning-related deaths by ethnicity in the UK, says Obe.  \u201cAt the moment, we don\u2019t know how much of a disparity there is between drowning and fatalities, aquatic fatalities for different communities in the UK because, up until now, drowning data isn\u2019t really captured by ethnicity, which is another point, another issue that the BSA is looking to tackle.\u201d \u2018People just don\u2019t think Black people should swim\u2019  Dearing, the first Black female swimmer to represent Britain at the Olympics when she competed at Tokyo 2020, \u201cimplores\u201d people to learn to swim.   \u201cI have been quite torn between the amazing achievement of being the first Black woman to represent GB in swimming but wanting to be my own person, my own athlete, who\u2019s known for being an athlete and not for her race and her sport combined together,\u201d she tells CNN Sport. \u201cI take the two of them just as they are \u2013 kind of like separate things. I\u2019m trying to be the best athlete and best role model that I can be to show people that they can do the sport, that the sport is for everybody.\u201d At the age of 24, Dearing was making history in Japan and became a beacon of hope for young people \u2013 especially Black girls \u2013 who wanted to break into the sport.   But her personal triumph also drew attention to the institutional access gap for people of color in swimming.    \u201cFortunately, for myself, I haven\u2019t come across any barriers at the level I\u2019m at currently,\u201d Dearing says.   \u201cBut I have faced barriers when I was younger and issues where people just don\u2019t think Black people should swim, or do swim, or think that we\u2019re better suited to other sports and so shouldn\u2019t even learn to swim or attempt swimming in the first place.\u201d  CNN reached out to the International Swimming Federation (FINA), Sport England and USA Swimming requesting a breakdown of Black and ethnic minority participation in swimming at grassroots and professional levels of the sport. However, they told CNN they were unable to provide such data.  FINA \u2013 the global governing body for swimming \u2013 told CNN it does not have a breakdown of the ethnicities of swimmers at a grassroots or elite level.   FINA said in 2021 it allocated $6.6 million towards development programs for distribution among all national federations and continental associations, while also pushing for diversity in the sport through its \u201cSwimming for All, Swimming for Life\u201d program.   \u201cFINA remains fully committed to non-discrimination,\u201d the organization said to CNN in a statement. \u201cFINA continues to work hard to ensure that the global aquatics community is a place where all athletes, coaches and administrators are treated equally. \u201cWork will continue to develop and grow with the support of members of the aquatics community as we strive to be at the forefront of this essential area,\u201d FINA added.    Sport England told CNN in a statement that it is \u201ccommitted to increasing investment in facilities and organisations across England to try to level up access to good quality sports and activities.\u201d \u201cBarriers to getting active persist and have even been exacerbated for some disadvantaged groups \u2013 like women, people with long-term health conditions, disabled people, people from ethnically diverse communities and lower socio-economic groups,\u201d the statement added.   Sport England said in May it announced further funding that brings its total investment in its 121 partners to more than \u00a3550 million ($670 million), which they\u2019ve selected \u201cdue to their unique position to tackle entrenched activity inequalities and influence positive change throughout the sector, their own networks and beyond.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s not all about the economic side of things. It is also about getting people to feel comfortable with putting their kids in swim lessons and in competitive swimming so that they can then go and do other aquatic-based sports,\u201d Joel Shinofield, the managing director of sport development at USA Swimming, told CNN during a phone call.  USA Swimming is a membership-serviced organization that has over 3,100 clubs and more than 400,000 members, according to the official website.   \u201cOur goal is to facilitate opportunities and make sure they\u2019re good ones. While our clubs are the ones that do that on the local level, the resources, guidance, support, financial investment that we provide can shift who those opportunities can be provided to and more broadly create access,\u201d he added.   Shinofield said that USA Swimming has established a 10-year initiative that will grant $1 million to develop learn-to-swim and competitive opportunities for communities served by Historical Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The program was announced in 2021, according to the USA Swimming official website.   Serving underrepresented communities  From representing their organization at the UK\u2019s first Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Summit For Sport in Birmingham, England earlier this year to facilitating swimming classes in Hackney \u2013 one of the most deprived boroughs in London \u2013 Obe hopes that the BSA will help bridge the barrier through community-level engagement.   \u201cThat community engagement really is to build trust, accountability and collaboration with disenfranchised communities and the sector,\u201d says Obe.  \u201cOnly in understanding these attitudes and understanding some of the barriers that preclude our communities from engaging in aquatics can we begin to drive change.\u201d  In August 2021, the BSA announced it would conduct a research program with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the University of Portsmouth, exploring the behaviors and barriers that prevent African, Caribbean and Asian communities from swimming.    Speaking about the program, Obe says: \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to inspire confidence with African, Caribbean and Asian communities, and the only way we\u2019re able to do that is to ensure that we understand where these communities are in the first place and understand why they don\u2019t engage in aquatics, why we don\u2019t see the representation pool side and why we don\u2019t even see the representation within some aquatic organizations.\u201d  Dale also volunteers with Mental Health Swims, a grassroots organization that facilitates swimming meet-ups for people struggling with their mental health. As part of her work for the organization, she coordinates swim events in south London to help swimmers access the mental health benefits of the sport. She also volunteers for Pride in Water, a network that aims to increase LGBTQ+ representation in swimming.   \u2018The future is bright\u2019  Dearing says that despite the racial and economic barriers to swimming for African, Caribbean and Asian communities, she\u2019s still optimistic about the changing landscape of the sport.  \u201cI really think if anything is going to change, it\u2019s going to be now, it\u2019s going to be over the next couple of years,\u201d she says. \u201cEach story is different, each person is different and has to be understood in their own way, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, that\u2019s just another challenge that we have to face and we\u2019re up for it.  \u201cIt\u2019s tough \u2013 it\u2019s not a quick fix, but the future is bright.  \u201cI like to feel that I\u2019m giving something back to swimming and, hopefully, giving something to the Black community to hopefully achieve, strive for and change the way that Black people are viewed in swimming and the way Black people view swimming.  \u201cIt\u2019s a double-edged sword; I absolutely love doing it. Sometimes, it\u2019s really frightening and daunting, but if I\u2019m trying to make the world a better place, then sometimes you got to step out and scare yourself.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/07/25/sport/black-representation-swimming-equality-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2023_02_05_sport_head-injury-suicide-female-athletes-intl-spt-cmd", "text": "Kelly Catlin and Ellie Soutter never met, but they had a lot in common.  Both were commanding athletes: Catlin, a US track cyclist, was a three-times world champion and Olympic silver medalist, and Soutter, a snowboarder, was tipped to be one of Team Great Britain\u2019s strongest contenders for the 2022 Winter Olympics, having already won a bronze medal at the 2017 European Youth Olympic Festival.  Both were incredibly smart \u2013 Catlin was studying for a master\u2019s degree in computational and mathematical engineering at Stanford University, while Soutter learned to speak French in about six months, according to her father.   At times they almost seemed superhuman. In 2013, after only three weeks of formal training and having broken her wrist, Soutter became British Champion with her arm in a cast. Meanwhile, Catlin, who had a tenderness for children, once rode 80 miles through sleet and snow to speak to a grade school about her Olympic experience.    Yet these two women\u2019s lives were tragically cut short after they sustained serious head injuries in their pursuit of sporting greatness and then took their own lives. Catlin was 23, while Soutter died by suicide on her 18th birthday.  Females may be more susceptible to concussion, and they also have worse and prolonged symptoms after their injury than men, according to a review of 25 studies of sport-related concussion published in the Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine.  However, women remain significantly underrepresented within sport and exercise science research. This, leading experts warn, means they often do not get the treatment or aftercare they need following a head injury.  Women\u2019s sports have historically not received the same attention or funding as men\u2019s sports, Dr. Ann McKee, Director of the Boston University Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s been shown that women athletes are more likely to get a concussion, they tend to have longer recovery periods,\u201d McKee added. \u201cWe do not have enough information about what happens in the female brain. We don\u2019t know if women are biologically more susceptible to these injuries,\u201d she said, adding that some research suggests the size and musculature of women\u2019s necks could play a part. Kelly  Before becoming a track cyclist, Catlin, a triplet, was a national champion road cyclist and time trial national champion, her father Mark, told CNN. After winning a Canadian international race at 17 she was invited to an Olympic training camp for a try out, where, impressed by her performance numbers, coaches immediately offered her a position on the track pursuit team.  Catlin\u2019s father, Mark, told CNN, that his daughter was \u201cintense\u201d and \u201cambitious,\u201d attributes she channeled into her sporting life. Her life changed irrevocably in January 2019. Practicing fast downhill descents in the hills near Los Angeles, she crashed and went skidding down the road.  Despite suffering road rash, Catlin got back on her bike, and finished the ride. It wasn\u2019t her first crash \u2013 she had experienced 4 or 5 hard crashes before this, her father said, and after the latest, she didn\u2019t have any symptoms at the time.  But soon after, at a World Cup track event in Berlin, Catlin was gripped by a sudden and severe headache.   \u201cShe couldn\u2019t compete,\u201d her father said. \u201cKelly is kind of this stoical individual. And if she\u2019s rolling around on the ground, clutching her head, it has to be a severe thing.\u201d On closer inspection, Catlin\u2019s helmet from LA had dents in it. Her father told CNN that this, coupled with her symptoms, caused her family to become aware she had suffered a concussion, which was later confirmed with a diagnosis from Stanford\u2019s Health Centre.  A concussion is a brain injury which happens after a hit to the head or body causes the brain to move back and forth inside the skull, according to the CDC. When Catlin returned to the US, her father says she was examined by the track training center in Colorado. It was confirmed she suffered a concussion, and a return to training protocol was advised, but not implemented or communicated to her coach, he said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any follow-up from Colorado after this. I believe they assumed she would seek care at Stanford,\u201d he told CNN.  CNN has reached out to Stanford and USA Cycling for comment.  Catlin\u2019s symptoms didn\u2019t improve, and in weekly phone calls with her parents, she admitted she was struggling with schoolwork and was unable to concentrate. Stanford Health Center, having diagnosed Catlin with concussion with ongoing symptoms, recommended that she decrease her training for 2 weeks and then gradually build back up and start sessions with an athletic trainer, medical documents sent to CNN by her father show. She was referred to a concussion specialist, the document adds. She tried to train, but \u201cshe would have to stop because she got a severe headache just from walking,\u201d according to her father. Her heart rate would also accelerate rapidly from even the smallest exertion, leaving her with \u201cno exercise tolerance whatsoever,\u201d he added.  Her injury had other consequences. \u201cAs far as we knew she was never a person that suffered from depression. She had an interesting sense of humor.  She was always upbeat and bubbly about things,\u201d her father told CNN.  \u201cShe basically thought her life was over. She was no longer able to be the athlete that she was, she was failing her teammates. And she wasn\u2019t able to succeed in school now. And I think ultimately, that\u2019s why she took her life, because she thought her life was over,\u201d he added.  At the end of January, Catlin made a serious but non-fatal suicide attempt, and was involuntarily admitted to the locked psychiatric ward at Stanford, her father told CNN. A month after that attempt, she took her own life.     Ellie   Soutter\u2019s father Tony said there were many dimensions to his young daughter \u2013 not only was she an \u201cadrenaline junkie,\u201d but she was \u201cvery conscientious\u201d and excelled in school, even after moving from England to France.   Aged 12, Soutter took up snowboarding at school \u2013 and just months later, she was spotted in her hometown resort of Les Gets and trialed by Team Great Britain in February 2013.  \u201cIt was quite obvious why she kept winning competitions because she just made it easy,\u201d her father said. \u201cShe just made it look graceful and beautiful.\u201d But training took its toll \u2013 Soutter told CNN that his daughter suffered seven major concussions in five years, between 2013 and 2018.  \u201cI was being advised by doctors \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, she\u2019s young enough she\u2019ll bounce back. As she progressed, becoming an elite athlete starting on the World Cup circuit, every time she had another concussion, they got worse, and they took longer to recover from,\u201d he told CNN.     \u201cWith every concussion, with the exception of a few minor knocks, Ellie saw a doctor in person,\u201d he added. \u201cI was always told that she was young enough to bounce back to full health after each case and therefore never consulted with the doctors that I met, about any previous concussions.\u201d But Soutter\u2019s final concussion was so \u201chuge\u201d that she spent two nights in the hospital. \u201cWhen I got there, she didn\u2019t even know who I was or where she was,\u201d her father said. Soutter was then selected for the Junior Snowboard World Championships in New Zealand August 2018.  But a month before the competition, she died by suicide.  Her father said a neurologist conducted a CT scan of her brain and reaction tests three months after her final concussion, but said she was \u201cabsolutely fine\u201d and could continue competing.                                                                                                                                 Like Catlin, Soutter had issues with studying and concentrating, becoming more insular as she suffered from crippling headaches. She also started suffering from insomnia.  \u201cShe would literally sit with the tutor a good month after a concussion, and suddenly, she\u2019d go blind. She\u2019d not be able to see \u2013 everything would go black and dark,\u201d her father said. After missing a flight to snowboard training, Soutter died by suicide on her 18th birthday. Team GB referred CNN to GB Snowsport when approached for comment, adding that Ellie only competed for Team GB at one event.  In order to represent Britain in international competitions, GB Snowsport says athletes or their coaches are required to demonstrate that the athlete has reached established performance criteria, is of the relevant technical ability to compete, and has appropriate medical clearance to compete. A large number of athletes can represent Britain at different levels of international competition but are not part of a programme delivered and overseen by GB Snowsport.  \u201cAs Ellie was not part of the GB Snowsport programme, we were unable to implement a personalised recovery and management programme for Ellie,\u201d a spokesperson for GB Snowsport told CNN in an email. \u201cShe was, however, covered by national policies and protocols around fitness to compete, and would not have been cleared for any activity \u2013 training or competition \u2013 overseen by GB Snowsport without being able to demonstrate appropriate medical sign-off,\u201d they added. The spokesperson for GB Snowsport told CNN: \u201cWe take concussions and head injuries incredibly seriously, and in reviewing contemporaneous records from the time that Ellie was involved in snowsport we are confident that GB Snowsport staff applied and followed every appropriate process.\u201d Catlin and Soutter aren\u2019t the only young sporting women whose lives have been cut short in this way. After 29-year-old Australian rules football player Jacinda Barclay took her life in 2020, post-mortem research by scientists found that she had degradation to her cerebral white matter unusual for someone her age.  \u201cFor someone her age, you would expect to see lovely pristine white matter, and hers looked like she was an old woman in that it was basically degraded,\u201d Michael Buckland, founder and Executive Director of the Australian Sports Brain Bank, who studied Barclay\u2019s brain, told CNN.  \u201cWe haven\u2019t gone back and done specific white matter studies on our donors,\u201d he told CNN, adding that the bank hasn\u2019t done peer reviewed research on this.  \u201cBut what struck me, just as someone that sees a lot of brains \u2013 this is not normal for someone of that age.\u201d  Damage to white matter has been associated with dementia, according to research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.   Opportunities missed Suicide after concussion is rare. However patients diagnosed with concussion or mild traumatic brain injury had double the risk of suicide and a higher risk of suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts than people without brain injuries, a 2018 study from researchers at the University of Harvard published in JAMA Neurology found. Dr. Robert Cantu, clinical professor of neurology at the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at Boston University School of Medicine told CNN that there are several theories as to why incidence of suicide is higher in people who have suffered concussion. One theory, he explained, is that those suffering from persistent post-concussion symptoms may have structural or functional brain damage and could be experiencing \u201cbehavioral dysregulation: short fuse, irritability, [and] can\u2019t suppress impulses the way you normally could.\u201d   With these emotional problems, \u201cthey would be more prone to perhaps do something impulsive, like commit suicide,\u201d Cantu, medical director of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, told CNN. A second theory, Cantu noted, is that post-concussive symptoms prevent people from getting back into their sport and stop them \u201cfrom being the person that they were before their injury.\u201d Neither theory is proven to the exclusion of the other, Cantu said, adding he thinks increased suicidality was \u201ca combined factor involving both in many, if not most cases.\u201d There are also differences in the way brain injuries affect women.  A study of female soccer players across US high schools found they are nearly twice as likely to suffer concussion as their male counterparts, according to research that looked at over 80,000 adolescent athletes, published in the journal JAMA Network Open.  Women remain significantly underrepresented within sport and exercise science research: a 2021 study examining papers from some of the most influential sports medical journals found that only 6% of the studies were solely focused on women, compared with 31% of studies that included just men. Other researchers have pointed to female sex hormones, with risk of concussion changing with hormone levels during a menstrual cycle.  McKee said all athletes can also experience \u201cnon-concussive\u201d injuries: \u201chits to the head that can be of the same magnitude as concussion, but they don\u2019t rise to the level of symptoms for whatever reason, so a player tends to play right through it.\u201d Cumulative exposure to repetitive head impacts \u2013 including concussion and non- concussive injuries \u2013 increases the risk for the neurodegenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known as CTE, McKee said.  The disease, which can only be formally diagnosed with an autopsy, has mostly been seen in either veterans or people who played contact sports, particularly American football, say researchers. The disease occurs when the brain starts to degenerate likely due to repeated head traumas, according to the Mayo Clinic, which notes CTE is \u201cassociated with recurrent concussions.\u201d But scientists aren\u2019t only concerned about concussions.  Previous studies have shown subconcussive head impacts \u2013 repetitive hits to the head and body that do not cause symptoms \u2013 can still result in long-term neurological disease.   According to The Concussion Legacy Foundation, \u201cthe best available evidence suggests that subconcussive impacts, not concussions, are the driving force behind CTE.\u201d There have been cases of CTE discovered in athletes who have never been diagnosed with a concussion, according to the Concussion Legacy Foundation. And other changes in the brain after repetitive head impacts aside from CTE are likely \u201cequally important,\u201d McKee said. \u201cWe also see damage to the white matter. And that appears to be mostly in the frontal lobe, but also in the temporal lobes,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to understand the relationship of those white matter changes to behavioral and mood symptoms, perhaps even suicidality,\u201d she said.  McKee stressed that concussion management is important, but physicians and athletes should also be aware of other injuries. \u201cThe problem is the subclinical hits \u2013 the non-concussive injuries that aren\u2019t detected, you don\u2019t pull the player off the field \u2013 and they can be in the hundreds or even the 1000s in a single season,\u201d she explained. Lack of research  Though a growing body of data suggests women in sport are more likely to sustain a concussion, have more severe symptoms, and to take longer to recover, most sports-related concussions protocols are based on data from men.  In a review in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers looked at 171 concussion studies written since 1967 which are used to inform the most influential consensus and position statements in treating sports-related concussions. Clinicians rely on these documents to guide their medical practice when treating athletes \u2013 but most of the studies are focused on men. Only 1% of them was looking exclusively at concussions in women and 40% of them didn\u2019t have any women in a sample of participants at all.   There is another risk factor for women in sport when they sustain head injuries, Katherine Snedaker, founder and executive director of PINK Concussions, a non-profit dedicated to women\u2019s health and brain injury, told CNN.  There is a gulf of millions of dollars separating women and men when it comes to average annual salaries in most professional sports. Outside of elite sport, Snedaker says, female athletes often don\u2019t have access to the same medical care as men, meaning head injuries aren\u2019t spotted as routinely.   \u201cThey tend to push really hard through the injury,\u201d she said. And many women can\u2019t afford to take time out to recover: even professional athletes will supplement their sports income with other jobs, she added, and many are caregivers. \u201cWhen they really crater, it\u2019s a couple of days or weeks later.\u201d  Snedaker said female athletes often weren\u2019t aware they had suffered a head injury. If they were, she said, there were no appropriate medical or sporting staff to inform. Not enough support The families of Catlin and Soutter feel the young women didn\u2019t get enough support after their injuries. After Catlin\u2019s first suicide attempt, she was released from an involuntary admission to the psychiatric ward after threatening legal action, and a conference between psychiatrists, her coach and her parents.  She attended therapy sessions, which she agreed to attend during the conference, but found \u201cthey were geared toward suicidal freshman with a whole set of different issues than an elite Olympic athlete,\u201d her father told CNN. She got a referral to a sports psychologist that worked with the Stanford athletic department, but the department forbade the psychologist from seeing Catlin because she was not a varsity athlete, her father added.  She contacted the office of a sports psychologist with whom she had developed a rapport while in the hospital \u2013 but, his appointment secretary said he had no openings for six months, her father told CNN.  \u201cWherever she turned she could not find help,\u201d he said, adding that his daughter tried a suicide hotline several times: she was once put on hold and once received no answer. Catlin described his daughter as a \u201cstoic, female warrior type person that isn\u2019t going to admit that she\u2019s struggling.\u201d  \u201cShe needed a sports psychiatrist that really could understand what she was going through and understand the rigors of her life in terms of preparation for competitions and the athletic side of it and what it could potentially do to you.\u201d Her father said a major factor in his daughter\u2019s death was \u201ca lack of communication between the facilities that were involved in Kelly\u2019s care. No one was in charge and they assumed the other institutions were following up when they weren\u2019t,\u201d he added. In a statement sent to CNN, Luisa Rapport, director of emergency communications and media relations at Stanford University did not address any of the specific allegations made by Catlin\u2019s family.  She said while the university does not discuss in the media the details of individual students\u2019 experiences, \u201csupporting the mental and emotional health of students is a critical priority for Stanford.\u201d  \u201cStudents in need of mental health crisis assistance \u2013 including students having suicidal thoughts \u2013 and those who are concerned about students in need of assistance, can contact the University\u2019s Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) 24 hours-a-day, seven days-a-week,\u201d she added. Rapport said that in addition to this, \u201cthere are multiple places where psychological services may be provided for students depending on individualized need and treatment recommendations, including, for example, affiliated hospital services and clinics through Stanford\u2019s Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, and mental health programs and clinicians in the community.\u201d In a statement sent to CNN, USA Cycling said it was \u201cdevastated\u201d by Catlin\u2019s death, adding: \u201cShe brought focus and determination to everything she did, and served as an inspiration to everyone who knew her.  \u201cAs the National Governing Body for the sport of cycling, USA Cycling prioritizes the holistic wellbeing of the riders on the U.S. National Team and has a longstanding commitment to providing both physical and mental health resources to members of the team,\u201d a representative for USA Cycling added.   After his daughter Ellie\u2019s death, Soutter was contacted by the UNITE Brain Bank, who wanted to study her brain as part of their research into CTE. But even in that facility \u2013 the biggest of its kind in the world \u2013 of some 1,300 brains, only 3% belonged to women, Ann McKee, Director of the Boston University Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center told CNN. \u201cWhen I actually started looking into CTE \u2013 all of the work that they\u2019ve done with the footballers in America, she had every single symptom and more,\u201d Soutter told CNN. \u201cIt was quite obvious to me that there was a definite link in her starting to get into dark places and feeling bad and anxious and not sleeping properly. All of those symptoms \u2026 Every one that\u2019s involved in CTE was part of Ellie\u2019s life,\u201d he added. \u201cI truly believe today that my daughter would be alive had I had any inkling, you know, even the smallest bit of information.\u201d Editor\u2019s Note: If you are in the US and you or a loved one have contemplated suicide, call The National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255) to connect with a trained counselor.

{"id": "2023_09_20_sport_saudi-arabia-soccer-spl-bin-salman-intl-spt-cmd-dg", "text": "When Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal reportedly planned a $1.1 billion bid to sign French soccer superstar Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 \u2013 including $332 million to his club, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), and an eye-watering $775 million salary packet to the World Cup winner for just one year \u2013 it was slammed by critics as sportswashing. Mbapp\u00e9 might have said no to the offer in July, but a month later, Neymar Jr. said yes to Al-Hilal, as the Brazil star moved from PSG for a transfer fee of around $98.5 million (\u20ac90 million) plus add-ons, according to multiple reports. In a record-breaking transfer window, Saudi Pro League (SPL) clubs spent close to $1 billion, acquiring 94 overseas players from Europe\u2019s major leagues \u2013 France\u2019s Ligue 1, Spain\u2019s La Liga, Italy\u2019s Serie A, Germany\u2019s Bundesliga and the English Premier League \u2013 according to Deloitte. Despite the Arab nation\u2019s poor human rights record, Saudi Arabia\u2019s spending spree to turn its domestic soccer league into a star-studded, bona fide competition shows the seriousness of its ambition. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman says he doesn\u2019t \u201ccare\u201d about the country\u2019s investment in sport being described as sportswashing. \u201cWell if sportswashing is going to increase my GDP by one percent, then I will continue doing sportswashing,\u201d MBS said in an\u00a0interview\u00a0with Fox News which aired Wednesday. Pressed on if he was bothered by the use of the term, MBS continued: \u201cI don\u2019t care. I have one percent GDP growth from sport, and I am aiming for another one and a half percent. Call it whatever you want, we\u2019re going to get that one and a half percent.\u201d Saudi clubs, several of which have been taken over by the nation\u2019s sovereign Public Investment Fund (PIF), have already attracted some of the biggest names in the sport. By attracting some of the world\u2019s biggest stars to the Gulf states, the SPL wants \u201cto drive competitiveness on and off the pitch,\u201d though it\u2019s keen to emphasize that these overseas players will help develop \u201cyoung Saudi talent.\u201d During this summer transfer window, the government-controlled PIF increased the cumulative value of these four clubs nearly five times, making them the most valuable in the country, according to estimates by the sports website Transfermarkt. Plenty of other leading stars have eagerly said yes to the SPL, notably 2022 Ballon D\u2019Or winner Karim Benzema joining Al-Ittihad at the end of his contract with Spanish soccer giant Real Madrid. As the European transfer window came to a close, the four PIF-owned teams have spent nearly $900 million (\u20ac835.1 million) on buying elite international players, Transfermarkt data shows, which ranked them in the top 20 clubs in the world by transfer expenditure, alongside soccer giants from England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy. Al Hilal alone paid more than $378 million (\u20ac353 million), more than PSG and Arsenal, making it the second-largest spender this year. The newly acquired players join five-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, who has a two-year contract with Al-Nassr where he will earn a staggering estimated $200 million a year, according to Saudi state-owned media, currently making him the world\u2019s highest paid soccer player. As of today, 21 of the most expensive soccer players in Saudi Arabia by transfer fees \u2013 all international stars \u2013 play for one of the PIF-owned clubs. Despite the financial outlay, the SPL is remaining deliberately tight-lipped about the specifics of its financial gamble, with chief operating officer Carlo Nohra confirming to CNN Sport that it was \u201cnot in [the SPL\u2019s] competitive advantage\u201d to report the salaries offered to players and coaches. The PIF has $777 billion in assets under management, according to its most recent filing, with ambitions to top $1 trillion within a few years. In 2021, it acquired English soccer club Newcastle United, before focusing on investments at home. The club is now also among top spenders on players. Saudi clubs not owned by the PIF are also splurging on big-ticket players, with former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson, 33, offered an eye-watering salary of $870,000 (\u00a3700,000) per week, according to multiple reports, in an estimated $15 million (\u00a312 million) transfer from Liverpool to Saudi team Al-Ettifaq. In a recent interview with The Athletic, Henderson said those numbers \u201cjust aren\u2019t true.\u201d \u201cEssentially, the signal is \u2018We mean business,\u2019\u201d Simon Chadwick, a professor of sport and geopolitical economy at SKEMA Business School, told CNN.\u201cWe\u2019ve got so much money that for a player who is \u2026 coming towards the end of his career, we can afford to pay him 700,000 [GB pounds a week], or whatever it is that he\u2019s being paid, and still have Cristiano Ronaldo and still be in the market for other players as well,\u201d Chadwick said, describing Saudi\u2019s approach to becoming a sporting superpower, adding that the sky is the limit in terms of cost. Saudi\u2019s love of soccer Saudi Arabia follows in the footsteps of several other countries \u2013 including China and Qatar in investing large sums of money to try and turn themselves into soccer powerhouses. It remains to be seen whether Saudi\u2019s turbocharged investment will have a lasting impact or resemble something like a costly rebranding effort. The Saudi national team has been to multiple World Cups, and the country\u2019s clubs have won multiple Asian titles. Saudi\u2019s victory over Argentina during last year\u2019s men\u2019s World Cup was hailed as one of the greatest upsets in tournament history, with the country\u2019s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud granting a national public holiday in recognition of the win. Club games can attract huge crowds in the Middle Eastern nation. \u201cFor example, Al-Ittihad against Al-Hilal, you\u2019re talking about drawing crowds of 40, 50, 60,000 people, these are games that are comparable in size to Chelsea vs. Arsenal, Manchester United vs. Manchester City,\u201d Chadwick said. Buying star players, some arguably past their prime, also provides an easy win for Saudi teams, according to Kieran Maguire, co-host of \u201cThe Price of Football\u201d podcast. \u201cFrom the Saudi authorities\u2019 point of view, they\u2019re getting a ready-made product. Everybody\u2019s heard of Benzema. Everybody\u2019s heard of Cristiano Ronaldo and so on,\u201d Maguire said. Saudi Arabia\u2019s lofty sporting ambitions don\u2019t end with the SPL or Newcastle United. The country is hosting the 2023 FIFA Club World Cup and is bidding to host the 2027 AFC Asian Cup. Several media reports also indicated that the Gulf kingdom was considering launching a bid for the 2030 FIFA men\u2019s World Cup alongside Greece and Egypt \u2013 although it is reportedly mulling pulling its candidacy. Meanwhile, the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) has agreed to a contract that will see the Spanish Super Cup played in Saudi Arabia until 2029, a deal that will earn the Spanish governing body between \u20ac35-45 million ($38-48 million) a year. Appealing to the youth Saudi Arabia has a very young population: the country\u2019s most recent census revealed 32.2 million people live in the country, nearly 42% of whom are foreign nationals \u2013 and 51% of the Saudi population are under the age of 30.\u202fOf this populace, Saudi authorities say that over 80% play, attend or follow soccer, the national sport. Chadwick explains that Saudi Arabia\u2019s government is concerned with the prospect of its younger members of society becoming radicalized or an anti-government sentiment bubbling up like that of the Arab Spring \u2013 and looks to offer its population a thriving soccer industry to keep it placated. Though the soccer industry generates employment, revenues, export earnings and inward investment, \u201cwhat is just as significant is the security of the royal family,\u201d Chadwick adds. The Arab Spring, a wave of pro-democracy protests that washed over the Middle East and North Africa in 2011, achieved mixed results. Four Arab dictators in Libya, Yemen, Egypt and Tunisia were toppled, offering a brief sense of victory for protesters, but, since then, new wars have prompted a retreat of popular movements in the region. Meanwhile, failed uprisings in Bahrain and eastern Saudi Arabia were followed by years-long crackdowns and a continuing civil war in Syria. \u201cWhat we\u2019re beginning to see in Saudi Arabia right now is the emergence of a new social contract. And the social contract essentially is catering for the needs of the Gen Z population,\u201d Chadwick said. \u201cYou want Ronaldo? You got him. You want some of the best football teams in the world? You got them. You want the World Cup to come to Saudi Arabia? You got it \u2026 But don\u2019t question us,\u201d Chadwick explained. Maguire agrees, noting that investing in soccer \u201ccan be seen as part of a much broader socio-economic plan, run by the Saudi authorities.\u201d At the same time, there has been \u201ca significant increase in the number of Saudi Arabians detained by the authorities, for example, for posting adverse comments on social media about the country\u201d this year, Chadwick told CNN. Human rights group Amnesty International told CNN that it has documented a rollback in human rights in Saudi Arabia, including an escalating crackdown on freedom of expression and an increased use of counterterrorism and cybercrime laws to silence dissent. Between 2022 and 2023, the organization said it has documented an increase in criminal prosecutions compared to previous years. In 2022, Amnesty reported the highest number of annual executions in the country in 30 years, with 196 people killed. \u201cReputation is important in terms of attracting foreign investment, and \u2026 Mohammed bin Salman, as much as he has significant financial muscle, needs foreign investing for the realization of his diversification,\u201d James Dorsey, the author of the syndicated column and blog, \u201cThe Turbulent World of Middle East Soccer,\u201d explains. Saudi Arabia is the world\u2019s biggest exporter of crude oil, and nearly two-thirds of its income still comes from selling fossil fuels. But with oil prices regularly dipping below what the Gulf state needs to balance its budget, it has focused efforts on trying to bring in investment from abroad along with its efforts to raise oil prices. Projections indicate the kingdom has around 20 years to diversify its economy to ensure it is more resilient, according to Chadwick \u2013 not least to fund its Vision 2030 projects, including the $500 billion Neom city, a 106 mile-long linear city called The Line and a futuristic plan to revamp the capital. \u201cPart of the grand vision of Mohammed bin Salman, looking forward to 2030, he does have his desire to make Saudi Arabia less dependent on natural resources to look at a post-fuel economy [involving] tourism, entertainment. If Saudi Arabia can become a hub for major sporting events, then that\u2019s a way of attracting interest to the country,\u201d said Maguire. CNN has reached out to the Saudi Ministry of Sport for comment on allegations that the kingdom has been rolling back human rights, and investing in soccer as a way of \u201csportswashing\u201d its image. In response to previous criticism about Saudi Arabia\u2019s purported \u201csportswashing,\u201d the kingdom\u2019s sports minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal said: \u201cPeople that don\u2019t know Saudi Arabia, have never been to Saudi Arabia, go out and talk about it as if they\u2019ve lived there for 30 years, 40 years. So I always tell people, come to Saudi. Come and see Saudi. \u201cSee what it is, see the people, meet the people. Look at what the country is doing for the future of the people in Saudi, then you can criticize as much as you like,\u201d he added. Lack of transparency: Saudi threatens new systems of governance\u202fin sports Saudi Arabia has already disrupted the golf industry and, with soccer, Maguire told CNN, \u201cthey feel that they can do that probably on a smaller scale, but perhaps, ultimately, to generate more interest in terms of eyeballs if they go down the same route.\u201d In 2021, the Saudi government-controlled PIF bankrolled LIV Golf, reportedly at a cost of $2 billion, attracting many of the sport\u2019s top players away from the US-based PGA Tour and Europe-based DP World Tour by offering big dollar prize money, with PGA Tour board member Jimmy Dunne raising fears that they might end up \u201cowning golf.\u201d Earlier this year, the US-based PGA Tour announced it was set to partner with the Saudi-backed breakaway LIV Golf, ending a feud that has dogged the men\u2019s professional game for the past year, with Dunne warning that sport\u2019s governing body had no choice but to reach the truce to retain some measure of control. \u201cThey have an unlimited horizon and an unlimited amount of money,\u201d he said at a contentious Senate hearing on the truce between the two tours. When it comes to soccer, Aleksander Ceferin, president of European football\u2019s governing body UEFA, has dismissed the competitive threat that the SPL could pose. \u201cAs far as I know, Mbappe and [Erling] Haaland don\u2019t dream of Saudi Arabia. I don\u2019t believe that the best players at the pinnacle of their careers would go to Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said last month. \u201cWhen people talk to me about the players who went there, nobody knows where they\u2019re playing.\u201d Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp took a different view, referring to the fact that the Saudi summer transfer window stays open after European clubs see theirs close: \u201cI don\u2019t know how stable it is and I think the next two weeks will show how much of a challenge it is because whatever happens there, no one can react anymore. \u201cI don\u2019t know where it will lead to but it feels rather like a threat or a concern than not because I can\u2019t see how we really deny it in these moments, what can we do?\u201d he added. Still, the new SPL director of football, Michael Emenalo, says what Saudi soccer is doing is \u201cno different from what the Premier League have done.\u201d \u201cThere was a time when it was all about Italy. There was a time when it was all about Spain. What we\u2019re looking for in the industry is an opportunity to compete, and to compete on an even scale and to improve upon whatever exists in the industry,\u201d said Emenalo in a press release sent to CNN. New Saudi Pro League Chief Operating Officer Carlo Nohra told CNN that there is logic behind the league\u2019s strategy of money is no object to lure international stars. \u201cWe can\u2019t expect to be paying market value to entice people to come here at this early stage in our development.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0But analysts say that the difference lies in the level of transparency, which \u201csimply doesn\u2019t exist in Saudi Arabia,\u201d Chadwick explained to CNN. European soccer governing body UEFA has financial fair play (FFP) rules on teams\u2019 spending, while Major League Soccer in the US has a salary cap for its clubs. Nohra told CNN that, eventually, the country wants 0.3% of its GDP to be from soccer to make it similar to that of the Premier League on the UK economy \u2013 up from its current value of \u201c0.000 something.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve got no chance to get into that figure at present,\u201d Maguire explained, but added that the SPL could perhaps move into the top 10 of the world\u2019s domestic leagues. \u201cThat is feasible given the amount of money that they\u2019re spending.\u201d \u201cI think they\u2019re realistic. They don\u2019t say that they\u2019re going to overtake La Liga or the Premier League or the major European leagues,\u201d Maguire said. When the Peterson Institute for International Economics compared the world\u2019s sovereign wealth funds on criteria including governance, transparency and accountability in 2019, the PIF scored well below average on a measure combining these criteria, and ranked in the bottom 10 out of 64 funds, just above Russian Direct Investment Fund. CNN has reached out to the PIF for further comment about its investments in sport, particularly soccer and golf, and criticisms about its lack of transparency. Chadwick raised concerns over how a lack of financial rules affecting Saudi clubs might dilute UEFA\u2019s FFP regulations, as well as those of the Premier League, or impact world soccer governing body FIFA\u2019s systems of governance. The lack of transparency in Saudi Arabia\u2019s wealth fund has already raised suspicions in the US golfing and political spheres. Earlier this summer, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations launched an inquiry about the PGA Tour\u2019s agreement with the PIF-controlled LIV Golf. Chadwick told CNN that, so long as there is no independent organization that monitors the reporting of every league\u2019s financial endeavors, \u201cnobody really knows for sure what the accurate financial information is.\u201d \u201cThis vacuum [of information], this uncertainty is wrapped in a veneer of lobbying, which is intended to either overinflate or underinflate player transfer values and salary information because it serves a political purpose,\u201d Chadwick says, adding that this purpose is \u201csignaling.\u201d \u201cIt is almost as though football players are becoming kind of geopolitical pawns in some ways.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/09/20/sport/saudi-arabia-soccer-spl-bin-salman-intl-spt-cmd-dg/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_sport_caleb-williams-chicago-bears-hard-knocks-spt-intl", "text": "There is already significant hype surrounding the Chicago Bears and No. 1 overall pick Caleb Williams, and the spotlight will be turned up even further in the preseason when the team features on HBO\u2019s Hard Knocks series for the first time. The documentary series first ran in 2001 and provides fans with an \u201cunprecedented\u201d inside look into the day-to-day lives of players, coaches and staff, both on and off the field. The Bears have been selected for the training camp edition of the series, with much of the focus expected to be on how the squad\u2019s high-profile rookies and other new additions settle in at training camp. Chicago was one of 10 teams to have never been featured in the show, but the arrival of Williams has brought an air of expectation to the Windy City and made the team must-see TV \u2013 even before the season kicks off. Per the NFL, the series will premiere on Tuesday, August 6 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and will stream on Max. New episodes will run each Tuesday through September 3. \u201c\u2018Hard Knocks: Training Camp with the Chicago Bears\u2019 will provide our passionate fans across the world the ability to experience this unique and critical time in the history of our franchise,\u201d said Bears President & CEO Kevin Warren in a Thursday statement. The franchise is seeking to turn its fortunes around, having only finished the regular season with a winning record once in the last 11 campaigns. Chicago ended last year at 7-10, but owned the Carolina Panthers\u2019 pick due to a previous trade. The Panthers finished a league-worst 2-15, giving the Bears the first overall selection in the 2024 draft. After moving on from 2021 first-rounder Justin Fields, Chicago used their coveted pick on Williams, with fans hoping that he will develop into the franchise\u2019s first truly elite quarterback. The University of Southern California product enters the league with incredibly high expectations and was regarded as the consensus No. 1 selection in the months leading up to the draft. Head coach Matt Eberflus opted to not wait until the preseason to name Williams as the team\u2019s starting QB, announcing it in May shortly after the draft. The young signal-caller\u2019s arrival is not the only intriguing storyline that will be highlighted in the series. The Bears made several other splashy moves in the offseason, such as drafting wide receiver Rome Odunze with the ninth overall pick, who could form a fearsome rookie tandem with Williams in the passing game. The Bears also added former Philadelphia Eagles running back D\u2019Andre Swift and traded for veteran wide receiver Keenan Allen, who had spent the first 11 seasons of his NFL career with the Los Angeles (formerly San Diego) Chargers.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/sport/caleb-williams-chicago-bears-hard-knocks-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_sport_police-officials-charges-against-golfer-scottie-scheffler", "text": "High ranking police officials in Louisville, Kentucky, have privately voiced concerns that the felony charge against world No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler \u2013 who reportedly tried to drive around the scene of a fatal crash \u2013 is excessive, a source familiar with the discussions told CNN. It\u2019s the first indication some top brass at the Louisville Metro Police Department believe the charges against Scheffler should be reduced. The 27-year-old golfer was attempting to drive to the PGA Championship at Valhalla Golf Club at about 6 a.m. on May 17 when he came to the scene of a fatal crash. He injured a police officer who was directing traffic and was then detained and arrested, according to police. Scheffler was charged with felony second-degree assault on a police officer, along with lesser charges of third-degree criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding signals from officers directing traffic, according to Jefferson County court records. He was released from jail and returned to the golf course for his tee time in the second round of the major tournament. In a statement last week, Scheffler said he proceeded as directed and \u201cthere was a big misunderstanding of what I thought I was being asked to do.\u201d Scheffler\u2019s attorney, Steven Romines, told CNN in a statement Friday he plans to plead not guilty to the charges. During a recent meeting, multiple Louisville police officials discussed the charges against Scheffler,\u00a0and the group\u00a0agreed\u00a0that the felony charge seems excessive given the details of the case, according to the source with firsthand knowledge of the meeting. It is unclear whether they have discussed those opinions with the county attorney prosecuting the case\u00a0and how that may ultimately affect the charging decision. \u201cAs we have stated previously, no decisions have been made regarding the prosecution of the case involving Mr. Scheffler,\u201d said Josh Abner, a spokesperson for the Jefferson County Attorney\u2019s office. \u201cWe continue to gather information and will review and proceed accordingly.\u201d Police to hold Thursday news conference Louisville police will hold a news conference Thursday to address the case and are expected to release additional video of the arrest from a traffic pole camera. It is unclear if the initial encounter between Scheffler and the detective was captured on video. Police will investigate whether Det. Bryan Gillis, whose body camera was not turned on, followed department protocols during the incident, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said at a news conference Tuesday. \u201cI think that\u2019s critically important that we do that, not just in high profile events like took place on Friday, but on a regular basis,\u201d Greenberg added. \u201cAnd if policies are not being followed, there will be transparency about that. There will be action taken.\u201d O\u2019Connell\u2019s office is facing growing pressure from other local officials to reassess the charges against Scheffler. Louisville Councilmember Anthony Piagentini, who represents the district where Scheffler was arrested, told CNN he believes the case is being overcharged. \u201cI think the charges should either be dropped entirely or at least be dropped down to a very, very tiny misdemeanor,\u201d Piagentini said. \u201cI don\u2019t know every piece of evidence, but I know enough to say the officer was trying to do his job, Mr. Scheffler was trying to do his job, and an unfortunate circumstance happened.\u201d Piagentini said he found it strange O\u2019Connell showed up to court Monday to argue against delaying the arraignment, which Romines requested because of a scheduling issue the attorney was facing. \u201cThat\u2019s such a minor procedural detail,\u201d Piagentini said, adding that O\u2019Connell typically would have a different member of his team argue such a motion in court. \u201cHis actions have indicated he\u2019s treating this case differently, and he shouldn\u2019t.\u201d CNN also has reached out to the Louisville Metro Police Department for comment. Scheffler is scheduled to play Thursday in the Charles Schwab Challenge, in Fort Worth, Texas. He has a 1:45 p.m. ET tee time.

The 31-year-old L\u00f3pez gave up a two-run home run to Shohei Ohtani in the eighth inning before being ejected by third-base umpire Ramon De Jesus for shouting at him,\u00a0over a check swing call that didn\u2019t go his way.

Amid widespread\u00a0rumors\u00a0the singer would\u00a0perform at the Games\u2019 Opening Ceremony, singing an Edith Piaf song,\u00a0some members of France\u2019s far-right have questioned\u00a0whether she embodies French heritage, values and identity.\u00a0Piaf is a key figure in France\u2019s musical \u2013 and national \u2013 identity. \u201cThere\u2019s no way Aya. This is Paris, not the market\u00a0in\u00a0Bamako,\u201d said fringe\u00a0and extreme\u00a0far-right group Les Natifs (Natives) on X, formerly known\u00a0as Twitter, in March, referring to Mali\u2019s capital. Nakamura has defended herself on social media, saying on X: \u201cI\u2019m becoming the number one state subject in debates\u00a0\u2026but what do I really owe you all? Nothing.\u201d The singer has received support from Rachida Dati, France\u2019s Minister of Culture, who spoke out in defence of Nakamura, saying \u201cbe careful of the pretext of attacking someone out of pure racism.\u201d Paris 2024\u2019s organizing committee told CNN: \u201cWe were very shocked by the racist attacks against Aya Nakamura in recent days. We offer our full support to the most listened-to French artist in the world.\u201d Whether Nakamura will perform at the Olympics\u2019 opening ceremony is still unconfirmed, with the Paris 2024 organizing committee telling CNN that they\u00a0\u201cwon\u2019t be confirming or denying\u201d\u00a0any rumors or reports, to \u201cleave room for surprises\u201d on the day. CNN has reached out to Nakamura but she declined to\u00a0be interviewed\u00a0on the matter. \u2018She contributes to French culture\u2019 However, many others in France are all too keen to comment on this cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. Far-right politician Marion Mar\u00e9chal,\u00a0who is the niece\u00a0of far-right National Rally party leader\u00a0Marine Le Pen and a member of the\u00a0Reconqu\u00eate\u00a0party, told French\u00a0television stations BMFTV and Europe 1\u00a0that Nakamura\u00a0\u201cdoes not sing in French,\u201d referencing the blend of Parisian and African\u00a0derived slang\u00a0that often feature in her lyrics. \u201cI think that the people who criticize her actually don\u2019t accept that she embodies France,\u201d\u00a0French activist Rokhaya Diallo told CNN. \u201cThe\u00a0slang she uses is used by young people and a lot of young French people use slang.\u201d Nakamura often uses a mix of verlan and African derived slang from languages such as Bambara, from her birth country Mali,\u00a0in her music. Her number one hit song\u00a0\u201cDjadja,\u201d\u00a0contains the lyric \u201cle monde est tit-pe\u201d \u2013 the world is small \u2013 with word \u2018tit-pe\u2019 inverting the French word \u2018petit.\u2019 Verlan, a type of French slang named after\u00a0the inversion of the French word \u2018l\u2019envers\u2019 \u2013 meaning backwards \u2013 originates from the outskirts of Paris known as \u2018la cit\u00e9\u2019 (the suburbs)\u00a0that have had\u00a0large\u00a0immigrant population. At the inauguration of the\u00a0Olympic Aquatics Centre\u00a0earlier this month, French President Emanuel Macron\u00a0said that Nakamura \u201cspeaks to a good number of our compatriots\u201d and claimed that \u201cthese\u00a0games and ceremonies should reflect us, and she contributes to French culture, to French music.\u201d \u201cI want to defend here these choices and defend the fact that there must be artistic freedom and that politics should not interfere,\u201d added Macron. In an interview with France Inter,\u00a0Macron\u2019s political rival Le Pen, known for her right-wing views, claimed that the President was seeking to \u201coutrage\u201d and \u201chumiliate the French people\u201d when asked whether she thinks Nakamura opening the games would be a\u00a0good symbol. When asked to further explain why this choice would be a humiliation, Le Pen responded \u201cshe does not sing in French, or a foreign language, she sings nonsense.\u201d Speaking to CNN, Professor of Political Science at the University of Nice,\u00a0Vincent\u00a0Martigny, said that\u00a0while\u00a0there are those who believe it is right to promote minorities and their role in French culture, there are others, who hold more traditional views, which he terms as racist in relation to the country\u2019s colonial past. 1998 World Cup There have been moments of\u00a0perceived\u00a0unity in France\u2019s past, notably when the men\u2019s national soccer team won the 1998 World Cup. That triumph helped popularise the slogan \u201cBlack, Blanc, Beur\u201d \u2013 Black, White, Arab\u00a0\u00a0\u2013\u00a0amid a push for unity and inclusion. Beur\u2019 is verlan for the French word \u2018arabe.\u2019 France\u2019s World Cup winning team of 1998\u00a0was made up of a\u00a0diverse\u00a0group\u00a0of players,\u00a0not only of European descent but also from the ex-colonies of France\u00a0and other countries.\u00a0Many thought\u00a0at the time\u00a0that the 1998 team was a sign of a truly integrated, multi-cultural France. But notable social and cultural divisions have emerged in France in recent years. There have been\u00a0multiple bans and restrictions against Islamic dress. The nationwide ban on\u00a0public\u00a0schoolchildren wearing abayas,\u00a0was\u00a0denounced as an \u201cIslamophobic campaign\u201d by\u00a0one\u00a0politician\u00a0on the left.\u00a0Athletes have been banned\u00a0from wearing a hijab while competing representing France\u00a0at the Paris\u00a0Olympic Games. Then there have been multiple protests and riots over police brutality leading to the death of\u00a0some French inhabitants of North and West African heritage\u00a0from the suburbs of Paris, fueling backlash over policing methods in marginalized communities. Nakamura\u2019s\u00a0birth\u00a0country\u00a0of Mali is one of the many\u00a0former\u00a0French colonies. There are millions of French citizens, like Nakamura, who are either themselves immigrants or descendants of immigrants from\u00a0nations formerly colonized by France. These days France\u00a0finds itself embroiled in a very public debate over the recognition and acceptance of its immigrants as the country continues to reckon with its colonial history. Professor Martigny believes that the\u00a0nationalist\u00a0party is \u201cstronger than ever\u201d and that nationalists in France are \u201cmore nationalist\u201d and more open with their views today than they were in the past. Activist Diallo also believes that France is struggling to see itself \u201cas it is\u201d and recognize non-White individuals as fully French. \u201cDespite her successes, despite her undeniable achievements, we still think that it\u2019s not an honor for us to have such a woman represent us,\u201d Diallo told CNN, referring to Nakamura. \u2018The Great Replacement\u2019 theory Political scientist Oliver Roy, who is Professor\u00a0at the EUI School of Transnational Governance, told CNN that a common belief that could be fuelling the culture wars in France is an ideology\u00a0expressed\u00a0\u201cnot just [by] the extreme right, but also part of the traditional centre right\u201d known as \u201cthe great replacement.\u201d He describes\u00a0the term\u00a0as \u201cthe idea that there is a new population coming from the south, which is replacing the old traditional, French population.\u201d However, he maintains that this fear \u201cis not supported by demography, [or] by statistics, and is, of course, very ideological.\u201d According to Martigny, France\u2019s cultural divisions are amplified on social media by both extremes of the political spectrum. \u201cBecause of the social networks, public debates are more violent on these issues than they used to be,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a theatre for the expression of extremely strong minded, sometimes racist, very often offensive comments on Twitter, on X, and on other social networks,\u201d added Martigny. \u201cYou have a lot of X accounts who are really, really, really pro far-right. And so they played a role in discussing these issues and making it a controversy. And then this controversy is exported to the traditional media.\u201d \u2018Show a very optimistic face for France\u2019 As Nakamura was targeted by fringe and extreme far-right groups as well as far-right politicians, in an interview\u00a0with BMFTV and RMC,\u00a0Macron said that \u201cthe reactions shocked me \u2026 there\u00a0were\u00a0truly racist reactions.\u201d However,\u00a0Martigny says he sees\u00a0Macron\u2019s condemnation of the attacks as racist as an attempt to balance the scales after the passing of\u00a0what the professor called\u00a0a \u201cvery restrictive law on immigration\u201d a few months ago. In December, Macron passed a controversial bill calling for tougher immigration that was endorsed by the far-right, and rejected by many in his own camp. Politicians such as Le Pen hailed the legislation as an \u201cideological victory\u201d whilst French health Minister, Aurelien Rousseau resigned in protest.\u00a0It included many amendments tightening immigration laws, one of which dictated children born to foreign parents on French soil would no longer become automatic French citizens but would have to apply for citizenship. \u201cHe needs to make that forgotten in a certain way by showing that he has a sense of balance on these issues,\u201d\u00a0Martigny states. By promoting Nakamura, Martigny believes that Macron\u2019s ambitions may have been to \u201cshow a very optimistic face for France.\u201d \u201c[There are] very strong cultural wars in France revolving around pop stars, and the type of pop stars that you can mobilize or the type of artists that you can mobilize when you want to unite the country.\u201d With less than 100 days to go until the Olympics, many hope Paris 2024 will give France the opportunity to show unity. However, the heated reactions to Nakamura hints at a more pessimistic outlook.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/26/sport/aya-nakamura-france-culture-wars-paris-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "sports"}}

The No. 1 overall pick finished with 30 points, five rebounds, six assists, three steals and three blocks in the game, becoming the first rookie \u2013 and fourth player overall \u2013 in WNBA history to record a 30-5-5-3-3 stat line. She is now also the fastest rookie in WNBA history to record 100 points and 50 assists. \u201cHonestly, I think I just played with an aggressive mindset,\u201d Clark told reporters. \u201cI think that was the biggest thing, just to play downhill the best I could. \u201cI would have liked to have made a couple more threes \u2026 but I thought we did some good things and then we just kinda shoot ourselves in the foot.\u201d The Fever opened up a 55-48 lead with 2:34 remaining in the third quarter, but the Sparks then went on an 11-0 run to end the period and take a lead they never gave up. Christie Sides\u2019 team has now lost seven of its first eight games after a tough schedule to begin the season. The eight games they\u2019ve played since the season tipped off two weeks ago is also the most of any team in the league and double the number of games played by two other teams. Clark shot 43.8% from the field against the Sparks and went three-for-10 from deep. It was also the second highly anticipated meeting between Clark and Cameron Brink, the No. 2 pick in the draft, who ended a quiet night with just three points, three rebounds and two assists. Kia Nurse scored a team-high 22 points for LA, shooting five-of-six from beyond the arc. Despite the Fever\u2019s difficult start to the season, Clark continues to draw huge crowds with more than 16,000 again in attendance for Tuesday\u2019s game, including Indiana Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton. The 22-year-old recorded another seven turnovers in the defeat \u2013 a game-high \u2013 but believes she has \u201cimproved a lot since the start of the season.\u201d \u201cThe biggest thing for me is, when I get in there, I still get a little indecisive \u2013 and that\u2019s honestly where a lot of my turnovers are still coming from,\u201d Clark explained. \u201cJust a little indecision when I do get my feet in the paint, but I think I\u2019ve done a better job of probing and finding people open or finishing at the rim. I think I\u2019ve done a better job as well of understanding who\u2019s guarding me. \u201cThat will continue to get a lot better, [I\u2019ll] continue to take care of the ball a little bit better and find people, not be a little indecisive \u2013 I\u2019ve got to make decisions a little bit faster once I do get my feet in the paint.\u201d Up next for the Fever is a home game against the Seattle Storm on Thursday as Clark goes in search of her first win at Gainbridge Fieldhouse.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/sport/caitlin-clark-wnba-history-indiana-fever-sparks-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Adam Armstrong scored the only goal of the game in the first half as Southampton defeated Leeds United 1-0 in the Championship play-off final at Wembley Stadium to book its return to the top-flight of English soccer. According to Deloitte\u2019s Sports Business Group, Southampton will receive at least \u00a3140 million ($177 million) across the next three seasons through \u201cprojected increases in matchday, broadcast and commercial revenue.\u201d That would increase to more than \u00a3305 million ($386 million) if the club avoids relegation in its first season. Southampton joins both Leicester City and Ipswich Town in securing promotion to the Premier League this season. After the game, Southampton\u2019s captain Jack Stephens struggled to control his emotions as he summed up his elation, calling it \u201cthe best feeling I\u2019ve ever had in football.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m so proud to be captain of this club. I\u2019m so proud of the boys today, I think they\u2019ve been unbelievable,\u201d Stephens told Sky Sports. \u201cI think we probably didn\u2019t play our best game today but we showed a different side. A few people have doubted us over this season. Can we defend? Can we dig in? I think we really showed that today.\u201d A lot on the line With a place in the Premier League on the line \u2013 and the financial reward that comes with it \u2013 the Championship play-off final comes with high stakes and high pressure. And the pressure was particularly high ahead of this year\u2019s final, with both teams looking to bounce back to the top-flight of English soccer at the first time of asking having suffered relegation last season. Pouring rain before the game in northwest London only heightened to add to the dramatic nature of the day, before bright sunshine broke through as the game began. The game\u2019s opening exchanges were played with the magnitude of the occasion weighing on them, with chances few and far between. But the game sparked into life halfway through the first half when a neat through-ball from Southampton midfielder Will Smallbone sprung Armstrong running into the Leeds box before he blasted the ball past goalkeeper Illan Meslier to score his 24th league goal of the season. Despite Leeds opening up in the hopes of an equalizer, it was Southampton who came closest to doubling its lead, with only Meslier and key defensive interventions sparing Leeds from going into halftime with a two-goal deficit. Just minutes into the second half, Leeds almost drew level but Crysencio Summerville\u2019s curled effort flew just wide of the post. Leeds continued to pile on the pressure in search of that illusive equalizer and came inches away from doing so when Wales international Dan James hit a curling effort against the bar. But despite pushing and pushing, Leeds was unable to find a way through and Southampton secured its return to the Premier League at the first time of asking.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/26/sport/southampton-leeds-2024-championship-play-off-final-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_sport_brandon-mcmanus-nfl-sexual-assault-accusations", "text": "Two women have accused NFL kicker Brandon McManus of sexually assaulting them while he was on a team flight to London last September for the Jacksonville Jaguars, according to a new lawsuit. The women, identified as Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 in the lawsuit, worked as flight attendants on the Jaguars\u2019 team-chartered flight on September 28. Both women claim that during meal service on the flight, McManus \u201cgrinded\u201d his erect clothed penis against them.\u00a0McManus also tried to kiss Jane Doe 1 earlier during the flight, according to the lawsuit. McManus, who has since signed a contract to join the Washington Commanders, denies the allegations presented in the lawsuit. An attorney for McManus disputes the women\u2019s accounts. \u201cTo be clear, these are absolutely fictitious and demonstrably false allegations made as part of a campaign to defame and disparage a talented and well-respected NFL player,\u201d McManus\u2019 lawyer, Brett R. Gallaway, told CNN. \u201cWe intend to aggressively defend Brandon\u2019s rights and integrity and clear his name by showing what these claims truly are \u2013 an extortion attempt.\u201d The Jaguars organization, which was also named in the lawsuit, said in a statement to CNN on Wednesday: \u201cWe\u2019re aware of the complaint, and we acknowledge the significance of the claims. \u201cAs we continue to look into the matter, it bears emphasizing that we insist on an organization built by people who represent our community and game with the highest character and class.\u201d Jacksonville is accused of \u201cgross negligence\u201d in, among other allegations, its failure to create a safe work environment for the flight staff. Head coach Doug Pederson said at a press conference Tuesday that he could not comment \u201cuntil more information is gathered.\u201d A spokesperson for the Commanders, McManus\u2019s current team, said, \u201cOn Monday, we were made aware of the civil lawsuit filed on May 24 against Brandon McManus. We take allegations of this nature very seriously and are looking into the matter. We have been in communication with the League Office and Brandon\u2019s representation, and will reserve further comment at this time.\u201d NFL spokesperson Tim Schlittner told CNN the league is aware of the lawsuit, but declined to comment further. Attorney Tony Buzbee, who represents the two flight attendants, said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on social media that the women and their legal team tried to \u201cresolve this matter without the need for litigation\u201d prior to filing the lawsuit. \u201cOur efforts at resolution were met with arrogance, ignorance and stupidity,\u201d the lawyer said. The women say they have and will continue to have psychological and emotional distress as a result of McManus\u2019 alleged actions. They are seeking more than $1 million in damages against the NFL player and the Jaguars, and have demanded a jury trial. \u201cThe allegations made in this lawsuit are very serious,\u201d Buzbee said. \u201cWe made sure to fully vet them and speak to witnesses before even taking the cases.

{"id": "2024_05_21_sport_individual-neutral-athlete-olympics-explainer-spt-intl", "text": "Russian athletes have competed under several different guises throughout the 128-year history of the Olympics, and they will be known by another new name at Paris 2024. Following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine \u2013 supported by Belarus \u2013 in February 2022, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes should be prohibited from competing in international sporting events. In January 2023, the IOC announced its intention to allow these athletes to compete as neutrals, in a similar way to how Russian and Belarusian tennis players are presented at ATP, WTA and Grand Slam events without any reference to their nationality. The Russian Olympic Committee was then suspended entirely by the IOC in October 2023 when it absorbed Ukrainian regional sports organizations in Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia. There has been much debate around whether Russian and Belarusian athletes should be permitted to take part in the Olympics, with Ukrainian athletes in particular voicing their concerns. However, the IOC Executive Board ruled that it would be unfair to punish athletes based on their passports alone, thereby allowing some to compete in Paris, albeit under very strict conditions. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes at the 2024 Olympics. \u2018No flag, anthem, colors\u2019 An Individual Neutral Athlete is the name used to refer to athletes with either a Russian or Belarusian passport who will be competing at this year\u2019s Games in July and August. These athletes are referred to by the abbreviation AIN, which comes from the French translation Athl\u00e8tes Individuels Neutres. These athletes will be permitted to compete if they meet eligibility requirements. No reference to either country will be made at the Games through the athletes\u2019 participation. \u201cThe sanctions against those responsible for the war, the Russian and Belarusian states and governments, remain in place for the Olympic Games Paris 2024,\u201d the IOC said in a statement. \u201cNo flag, anthem, colors or any other identifications whatsoever of Russia or Belarus will be displayed at the Olympic Games Paris 2024 in any official venue or any official function,\u201d the statement continues. Competition gear for the AINs has not yet been revealed, so it is unclear whether it will bear the turquoise colors of the brand-new flag of the AINs, or that they will don basic sportswear. An anthem \u2013 without lyrics \u2013 has also been commissioned for use in medal ceremonies. Though AINs are eligible to compete and win Olympic medals, they will not be displayed in the medal table of nations. AINs will also be excluded from the parade of delegations at the Opening Ceremony on the basis that they are individual athletes rather than a team, though the IOC has said \u201can opportunity will be provided for them to experience the event.\u201d Individual Neutral Athlete Eligibility Review Panel In December 2023, the Executive Board of the IOC decided that Russian and Belarusian athletes who qualified through the existing qualification systems of international federations would have to meet strict requirements if they are to be selected as an AIN. There will be no Russian or Belarusian representation in team events, with participation limited to individual competition. Per the IOC, athletes who actively support the war or who are contracted to the Russian or Belarusian military or national security agencies will not be eligible to be entered or to compete. The same stipulation applies to support personnel. Like all other athletes, AINs will need to meet anti-doping requirements to be considered for selection. The eligibility of these athletes will be determined by the newly established Individual Neutral Athlete Eligibility Review Panel. Two-time NBA champion and six-time All-Star Pau Gasol is part of the panel, representing the IOC Ethics Commission. The Spaniard will sit alongside IOC Vice-President and former artistic swimmer Nicole Hoevertsz, and former Olympic table tennis gold medalist Ryu Seung-min, who will be representing the Athletes\u2019 Commission. International sporting federations will need to submit their lists of qualified athletes to panel for review. At the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo (postponed to 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic) and the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, Russian athletes competed under the name of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) \u00a0as a result of the country\u2019s state-sponsored doping program. Athletes could compete under the ROC banner if they could prove that they were not connected to the scandal. However, with the ROC bearing both the name and colors of Russia \u2013 as well as the subsequent suspension of the ROC in October \u2013 it was no longer a viable option for Russian athletes to compete under this name in Paris. It is also important to note that the ROC was not a neutral body, rather a delegation of Russian athletes which technically didn\u2019t compete on the behalf of Russia, but retained a right to represent the country in all but an official capacity. Numbers of AINs at the Paris Olympics The IOC stated that, as of March 28, 12 AINs with a Russian passport and seven AINs with a Belarusian passport have qualified for Paris 2024 but said that the final number of athletes who will actually compete at the Games would not be communicated until the selection process has been finalized. \u201cThe maximum number, which is unlikely to be reached, would be 55 and 28 respectively,\u201d the IOC told CNN. In comparison, Russia sent 330 athletes to Tokyo in 2021 while Belarus sent 104. There is also the matter of whether Moscow will actually accept the conditions laid out by the IOC. Russia is planning to host its own \u201cFriendship Games\u201d later in the year, an event which has been condemned by the IOC. The identity of the athletes is also yet to be revealed, but it is possible that Russian former world No. 1 tennis player Daniil Medvedev will be part of the field. The former US Open champion said that he would be happy to participate as a neutral. \u201cI decided for myself that whenever I can play the Olympics, I want to be there I want to represent what I can represent,\u201d he told reporters last month. \u201cIf it\u2019s not under the flag, I know who I am, I know why I play tennis and I played like this all my life. Russia has competed under a neutral banner on two previous occasions. The ROC was suspended in 2017 as a result of the doping scandal ahead of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea the following year, but selected Russian athletes who met pre-competition conditions were still given the opportunity to compete as \u201cOlympic Athletes from Russia\u201d and were represented by the Olympic flag. Russia and Belarus were also part of the \u201cUnified Team\u201d at the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona after the dissolution of the Soviet Union the previous year. The delegation was made up of former Soviet republics \u2013 aside from the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia \u2013 which had elected to compete as one unit. The Unified Team also bore the Olympic flag but winners were honored under the flags of their own nations.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/sport/individual-neutral-athlete-olympics-explainer-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Midway through the second quarter of Indiana\u2019s game against the Seattle Storm at Gainbridge Fieldhouse, Clark hit a long three-pointer over Storm guard Victoria Vivians. The pair collided as they ran back down the court, exchanging words as they came face-to-face before Fever center Aliyah Boston separated them. Both Clark and Vivians were both given technical fouls. In the WNBA, players are suspended for one game if they pick up seven technical fouls in one season. Following that, they will be suspended for a game for every other technical they receive. Indiana would go onto lose 103-88 to Seattle, with 22-year-old Clark scoring 20 points, as well as providing nine assists and three rebounds. \u201cWe\u2019re spending too much time talking to the officials,\u201d Fever coach Christie Sides, who also received a technical foul during the game after complaining about a decision that didn\u2019t go her team\u2019s way, told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to leave that alone. We\u2019ve got to just play our game and let them do their job and not put it in their hands to make decisions that ultimately hurt us. We don\u2019t want \u2014 we shouldn\u2019t get technicals.

Defensive woes Thursday\u2019s loss continues the Fever\u2019s torrid beginning to the 2024 season as the organization\u2019s recent struggles persist. The team has not had a winning record since 2015 and has failed to win more than 10 games in a season on five occasions during that span. The Fever do have a roster full of young, promising players, but it\u2019s defensive rating of 112.6 through its first nine games this season is the worst in the league. That defensive weakness has been apparent for a number of years - since 2017, Indiana has the worst or second worst defense in the WNBA in every season. \u201cThe third quarter was when we lost the game,\u201d Clark said afterwards. \u201cI just thought our defensive rotations were bad \u2026 It\u2019s not really about our offense. It was our defense. You\u2019re not going to win a basketball game giving up 103.\u201d The Fever has two games in the next three days, playing the Chicago Sky on Saturday and then the New York Liberty on Sunday in Brooklyn.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/sport/caitlin-clark-indiana-fever-seattle-storm-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_sport_kathleen-noble-rowing-uganda-paris-olympics-spt-intl", "text": "From learning how to row in boats patched together with duct tape to competing at the world championships in a different sport entirely, Kathleen Noble\u2019s rise to the apex of rowing has certainly been unconventional. Her journey now sees the 29-year-old set to become a two-time Olympian \u2013 Noble represented Uganda at the Tokyo Games \u2013 when she competes at Paris 2024. She is Uganda\u2019s first Olympic rowing participant, as well as the African nation\u2019s first and only White Olympian across any sporting discipline. A prodigious swimmer in her youth, Noble represented Uganda at the 2012 World Swimming Championships at just 17 years of age. Then, on a whim during her time as a student at Princeton University, Noble was convinced to try her hand at rowing. \u201cWhen I took my first steps into the sport, I had no thoughts or intentions of competing at a high level and certainly couldn\u2019t have imagined that this would be the direction that things would go,\u201d Noble tells CNN Sport. \u201cTo be honest, it is still a bit surreal to be competing on a stage like this. I don\u2019t think it was until they actually told me that Uganda wanted to send me to the Olympic qualifiers that I really thought, \u2018Oh, okay, maybe there\u2019s something here.\u2019\u201d Equipment issues The sport of rowing is still very much in its nascent stages across many parts of Africa, including Uganda. It was properly introduced to the country back in 2009 when the World Rowing Federation sent out a shipment of donated boats to help to grow a sport which carries with it significant financial entry barriers. It was on these boats that Noble learned to row skull (individual), as opposed to her time rowing crew (as a team in one boat) at university. Whilst the thought of training on Lake Victoria, one of Africa\u2019s Great Lakes and the world\u2019s largest tropical lake, may bring with it a sense of charm and serenity, trying to prepare to compete at Olympic level just isn\u2019t feasible given the lack of opportunities and investment afforded to rowing within Uganda, a reality which sees Noble now train out of Tennessee under former US rower James Martinez. \u201cThere is no history of rowing in Uganda. I mean, I\u2019m literally the first person, male or female, to even qualify for the Olympics,\u201d Noble says. \u201cIt is still extremely niche, and the community is very small. I probably know every single rower in the country personally. \u201cBack in 2016, I took eight months off from university to row in Uganda and I\u2019m so grateful that I did because I got to experience first-hand all the struggles that rowers back home go through on a daily basis. \u201cNot only is there a lack of competition and adequate coaching, but there is a lack of most basic essentials, such as having properly functioning equipment. \u201cWhen I was rowing on Lake Victoria, we were still using the boats donated back in 2009. We would be duct-taping them and trying to get people to patch them up with fiberglass for us.\u201d It is not just a lack of equipment which has hampered rowing\u2019s growth in the east African country. Governance is also a major issue, and the absence of proper oversight has seen many athletes leave the sport in recent times, according to Noble, due to \u201cpromises being made but not always being kept.\u201d The only way the sport has a chance to progress is through the help and funding from outside donors such as the World Rowing Federation. Muhumuza Rodrick Chandi,\u00a0the technical director of the Uganda\u00a0Rowing Federation, tells CNN Sport that the price of equipment and a lack of coaches has been an issue in the country. \u201cIt is true that there is a lack of coaches as most qualified ones have left Uganda in search of greener pastures,\u201d he says.\u00a0\u201cRowing, like most sports in Uganda, is voluntary, so once these coaches get better opportunities they migrate or leave the sport altogether. \u201cThe Ugandan Rowing Federation does suffer from a lack of funding, mainly because it doesn\u2019t get much budgetary support from the National Council of Sports as it\u2019s considered a small sport.\u201d \u2018Honor\u2019 representing Uganda Born in Nakaseke, central Uganda, in 1994, Noble is the daughter of Irish missionaries. \u201cUganda was a fantastic place to grow up in many ways, whether it be the great weather all year round or the friendly and cheerful nature of the people,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut as a White, blonde child, I maybe would have had an aversion to going out in public due to the amount of attention I\u2019d have gotten.\u201d Despite her differences, of which Noble is acutely aware, sport has allowed her to form a deeper connection with her birthplace. \u201cEven though I have Ugandan citizenship, there is an identity to being Ugandan which is about coming from one of the local tribes and having land and a history and ancestors going back a long way,\u201d she says. \u201cI respect that, but at the same time, I did grow up in Uganda. It\u2019s a place that is important to me and it does mean a lot to me to have people accept me as being Ugandan. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge honor to represent my country. It\u2019s been the way that I\u2019ve felt the most connection to my identity as a Ugandan. Growing up there, when people ask you where you\u2019re from, I would say Ireland, even though I was born and grew up there. \u201cBut I feel like as I\u2019ve gotten deeper into representing and rowing for the country, I have felt more strongly that I am Ugandan.\u201d Noble\u2019s acceptance by Ugandan sports fans has also been a great source of encouragement. While she says that she will occasionally receive the odd message on social media criticizing her for representing the country, the overwhelming majority of both fan and media messaging has been support and pride for raising the profile of Ugandan rowing. \u201cYou\u2019re always going to have haters and people who want to try to knock you down, that\u2019s kind of to be expected in high level sport nowadays with social media \u2026 but I find it extremely touching that whenever I am met with negativity, a barrage of positivity will follow,\u201d says Noble. \u201cI\u2019m very, very grateful for that.\u201d Platform for change Noble, on top of her sporting ambitions, works as a software engineer in Tennessee and, alongside her husband, is a homesteader with a small-scale farm producing food and animals for themselves. Like every athlete, she hopes that her Olympic journey will culminate atop the podium, but she does also head to Paris with a compelling sense of realism. \u201cRowing is not really a sport where you wake up and just have a great day and row faster than you ever have before,\u201d says Noble. \u201cIt is a little bit more deterministic than that. Sports that are really based around cardiovascular strength tend to remove that element of major surprise around results. I\u2019m not going to flat out say that my goal isn\u2019t to medal, but at the same time I need to be realistic.\u201d Winning a medal is not the only means by which you can determine an Olympian\u2019s success, though, with Noble hoping that her exposure during the Games can help to elevate rowing back in Uganda, ensuring that she is no longer its sole representative. \u201cI feel a sense of responsibility to try and help support athletes back home,\u201d she says. \u201cWhether that correlates to me having to do well, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily true. I get a lot of press whether I come first or last. \u201cI believe that the actual position that I come is less important than the spotlight that exists around the Olympics. That gives me the platform to raise awareness about the limitations and struggles that athletes have in Uganda to a global audience.\u201d Rowing, particularly singles rowing, can be a very isolating sport, a fact that Noble can attest to. But come July 26 when the Paris Games get underway, she will have the backing of an entire nation eager to witness what will, no matter the end result, be more Olympic history for Uganda.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/sport/kathleen-noble-rowing-uganda-paris-olympics-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Gauff, who won her first grand slam title at last year\u2019s US Open, reached the final at Roland Garros in 2022 and is looking to go one better at this year\u2019s tournament. The 20-year-old was dominant against Avdeeva, dropping just two games \u2013 one at the start of each set \u2013 and winning 23 out of 24 points on her first serve. \u201cIt was a good day for me,\u201d she said in her on-court interview. \u201cShe played well today, I think I was just the better player.\u201d The victory was Gauff\u2019s 50th in the main draw of a grand slam, while Andeeva, by contrast, was playing in the main draw of a major for the first time. Next up for the American is Czech qualifier Tamara Zidan\u0161ek, who reached the semifinals of the French Open three years ago \u2013 by far her best-ever run at a grand slam. Speaking to the Tennis Channel after her fifth first-round win at Roland Garros, Gauff reflected on some of the long-term goals for her career. \u201cI just want to win as many slams as possible,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing inspired by Serena Williams \u2013 she\u2019s the one and true and only GOAT \u2013 but I think being inspired by her, it allowed me to make my dreams as limitless as possible. \u201cI was taught from a young age to make your dreams as big as possible, even if they don\u2019t feel realistic.\u201d Elsewhere in the women\u2019s draw, defending champion Iga \u015awi\u0105tek defeated French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean 6-1 6-2 to set up a blockbuster second-round clash against fellow four-time grand slam winner Naomi Osaka. \u015awi\u0105tek, like Gauff, wasted little time in her opening match, requiring just over an hour to wrap up her 15th consecutive victory at Roland Garros. The 22-year-old \u015awi\u0105tek is the first women\u2019s player to reach that milestone since Justine Henin won 24 matches and three-straight titles between 2005 and 2010 \u2013 the latter a feat that the Polish star is trying to replicate this year. The world No. 1 is also unbeaten since April having won in Rome and Madrid ahead of this year\u2019s French Open. She now has an unusually difficult second-round match against Osaka, who has returned to tennis this year having become a mother. \u201cShe\u2019s a great person and her game style is pretty fun to watch as well,\u201d \u015awi\u0105tek told reporters about facing the Japanese star. \u201cI haven\u2019t actually played against Naomi on clay, so we\u2019ll see how that\u2019s going to go. \u201cWe need to prepare tactically for sure, but all these matches that we played on hard court were always really intense and tough. I\u2019m just glad that she came back and she\u2019s playing more tournaments even than before the break.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/sport/coco-gauff-french-open-first-round-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "sports"}}

{"id": "2024_05_29_sport_lexi-thompson-retirement-lpga-tour-spt-intl", "text": "Lexi Thompson will retire from professional golf at the end of the 2024 season, calling time on a decorated career at the age of 29, the American announced on Tuesday. The 11-time LPGA Tour champion revealed her decision ahead of her 18th consecutive US Women\u2019s Open appearance this week, 17 years since she burst onto the scene when \u2013 at just 12-years-old \u2013 she became the then-youngest player to ever qualify for the tournament. Having turned professional three years later in 2010, the Floridian clinched major glory at the 2014 Kraft Nabisco Championship \u2013 now the Chevron Championship \u2013 and represented Team USA at six Solheim Cups, as well as two Olympic Games. \u201cWhile it is never easy to say goodbye, it is indeed time,\u201d Thompson wrote in a letter, accompanied by a video, on Instagram. \u201cI\u2019m excited to enjoy the remainder of the year as there are still goals I want to accomplish. I\u2019m looking forward to the next chapter of my life. Time with family, friends, and my trusted companion [dog], Leo. \u201cI will always look for ways to contribute to the sport and inspire the next generation of golfers. And of course, I look forward to a little time for myself.\u201d Thompson peaked as high as world No.4 as she amassed a string of titles, but injuries contributed to a gradual drop in ranking to world No. 54. She has not registered a victory on the LPGA Tour since June 2019, but did win an individual title at the Aramco Team Series \u2013 a Ladies European Tour (LET) event \u2013 in October 2022. Finishing eight times inside the top-three at the five flagship events, Thompson repeatedly came agonizingly close to adding to her sole major crown, including an infamous near-miss at the 2017 ANA Inspiration (now Chevron Championship). A rules violation for mismarking her ball \u2013 reported by a TV viewer \u2013 saw Thompson hit with a four-shot penalty during the third round. Though she rallied to make a playoff, she was subsequently defeated by South Korea\u2019s Ryu So-yeon. \u201cYou haven\u2019t always been easy on me, or fair for that matter, but through all the ups and downs, you\u2019ve given me a platform to inspire others and positively impact the world,\u201d Thompson said in her letter. \u201cThat has been a driving force that kept me playing and relentlessly working to be better.\u201d \u2018A whirlwind of constant attention, scrutiny and pressure\u2019 Thompson spoke through tears during a press conference at Pennsylvania\u2019s Lancaster Country Club, US Women\u2019s Open host, on Tuesday. Her letter described a \u201cwhirlwind of constant attention, scrutiny and pressure\u201d since her breakthrough as a 12-years-old, with social media playing its part in Thompson sometimes finding it \u201cexhausting to maintain a smile on the outside while grappling with struggles on the inside.\u201d Asked what she was most proud of for overcoming during her career, a tearful Thompson answered: \u201cJust staying true to myself. Being out here can be a lot. It can be lonely. \u201cI\u2019ll be the last one to say like throw me a pity party. That\u2019s the last thing I want. We\u2019re doing what we love. We\u2019re trying the best every single day. You know, we\u2019re not perfect. We\u2019re humans. Words hurt. It\u2019s hard to overcome sometimes. \u201cBut having the people around you that love you and support you, I feel like that\u2019s been the biggest thing for me. I might not have a huge friend group, but to have the people that matter the most around me have gotten me through some really hard times.\u201d In October, Thompson became just the seventh woman ever to compete at the PGA Tour event when she teed up at the Shriners Open, narrowly missing out on making the cut after shooting even-par. Earlier this year, she joined compatriot Rose Zhang as the first women to take part in The Match, squaring off against PGA Tour stars Rory McIlroy and Max Homa. \u201cTo all the girls that have cheered for me, you have been my inspiration, my encouragement and my strength,\u201d Thompson added in her letter. \u201cOn the days that were tough, and I wanted to give up, your support motivated me to dig deep and keep competing.\u201d \u2018An inspirational player on and off the course\u2019 Tributes poured in from fellow players following Thompson\u2019s announcement, including from world No. 1 and the US Women\u2019s Open tournament favorite Nelly Korda. \u201cShe\u2019s had such an amazing career,\u201d Korda, chasing a seventh win in eight starts, told reporters Tuesday. \u201cI think she does an amazing job for the Tour. She spends so much time going to each Pro-Am party. She really dedicated her time to growing the game. It\u2019s sad to see that she\u2019s obviously leaving and not going to be out here with us anymore, but she\u2019s had an amazing career, and I wish her the best in this new chapter of her life.\u201d Reigning US Women\u2019s Open champion and fellow American Allisen Corpuz added: \u201cShe\u2019s had such a great career. I looked up to her, and I\u2019m not that much younger than her, but I watched her play in multiple U.S. Opens, watched her win a bunch. \u201cShe\u2019s just such an inspirational player both on and off the course. She\u2019s at pretty much every Pro-Am party, always up to do everything. Just to see how she\u2019s impacted the Tour is really special, and I just wish her all the best.\u201d LPGA greats Michelle Wie West and Annika S\u00f6renstam were among those who commented on Thompson\u2019s Instagram video, with 15-time winner Suzann Pettersen writing: \u201cThanks for all the battles, laughs and fairways we\u2019ve shared!

{"id": "2024_05_27_sport_rafael-nadal-alexander-zverev-french-open-2024-spt-intl", "text": "In what is possibly his final appearance at the French Open, 14-time tournament winner and Roland Garros legend Rafael Nadal was knocked out in the first round by No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev 6-3 7-6(7-5) 6-3 in three hours and five minutes. Zverev\u2019s straight sets victory perhaps puts an end to one of the greatest love affairs in the history of sport. Nadal, the \u2018King of Clay,\u2019 walked off Court Philippe-Chatrier to a thunderous ovation befitting his remarkable record in Paris, which now stands at 112-4. Some of tennis\u2019 biggest stars \u2013 and Nadal\u2019s rivals \u2013 were in attendance to watch this piece of history; Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz and Iga \u015awi\u0105tek, a self-confessed Nadal superfan, were all there to see the Spanish gladiator battle it out in front of an adoring crowd. One final dance? \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for me to talk,\u201d Nadal said in his on-court interview after the loss. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be last time I\u2019m going to be here in front of you. I am not 100% sure, but if it is the last time, I enjoyed it. \u201cThe crowd have been amazing in the whole week of preparation. The feelings that I have today are difficult to describe in words, but for me, it\u2019s so special to feel the love from the people in the place I love the most. \u201cThe first round wasn\u2019t the ideal one,\u201d he added of the draw against Zverev. \u201cI was competitive, I had my chances, but it wasn\u2019t enough against a great player like Sascha. For me, it\u2019s difficult to say what\u2019s going on in the future. \u201cIt\u2019s a big percentage that I will not be back here playing at Roland Garros, but I\u2019ve enjoyed it a lot. I\u2019m traveling with the family, having fun and the body is feeling a little bit better than two months ago.\u201d Nadal, who added that he was hoping to be back on Chatrier for the Summer Olympics, has struggled with injury since the 2023 Australian Open and was forced to miss the vast majority of last season as he tried to get his body ready for one last year on tour. But Eurosport pundit and two-time Roland Garros finalist \u00c0lex Corretja said Nadal had told him only last week that his body was feeling pain free for the first time in two years, leading him to think about potentially returning next season. Understandably, the French Open holds a special place in Nadal\u2019s heart and the 37-year-old did everything in his power to ensure that he was not only fit enough to play, but fit enough to compete at the highest level. He certainly did that at times in his defeat to Zverev. At the start of the third set, a couple of trademark forehand winners were whipped down the line, drawing a deafening roar from the crowd that almost blew the retractable roof off Chatrier. Even in the second set, Nadal found an early break of serve as the momentum appeared to be shifting after the German had taken the first, but he was unable maintain that level and Zverev fought back to take the set in a tie break. There was potential for the tide to turn again at 2-2 in the third when Nadal held a grueling 12-minute service game and fended off four break points, only for Zverev to break the Spaniard\u2019s next service game. Even staring defeat in the face, Nadal \u2013 famed for his tenacity and grit \u2013 never stopped battling for every shot, pumping his fist towards the crowd each time he won a point. In the end, though, Zverev was just too good; so good was one of his shots that Nadal couldn\u2019t do anything but applaud as it flashed past him.

The Justice Department, District of Columbia and 10 states involved in the lawsuit announced the proposed agreement with the NCAA on Thursday. The agreement would end the civil suit against the organization over their\u00a0transfer eligibility rule, which required student athletes who transferred more than once to sit on the bench for an entire season before being allowed to compete at their new school. Prosecutors said the rule forced college athletes to either stay in schools they wanted to leave or to transfer and miss out on athletic opportunities. The complaint also alleged the rule \u201cwas anticompetitive because it deterred college athletes from challenging anticompetitive rules in court,\u201d a news release from the Justice Department said. If approved by a judge, the deal would bar the NCAA from enforcing the transfer rule or adopting any similar rules between Division I colleges and universities in the future, the release said. It would also require the NCAA to issue an additional year of eligibility to certain qualifying college athletes who were previously deemed ineligible to play for any length of time because of the transfer rule. \u201cFree from anticompetitive rules that unfairly limit their mobility, Division I college athletes will now be able to choose the institutions that best meet their academic, personal and professional development needs,\u201d Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter said in the release. \u201cThis resolution is a testament to the benefits of federal and state enforcers working together to ensure free markets and fair competition for all Americans.\u201d The NCAA\u2019s Division II also had a similar rule but revised it to remove the year requirement for transfers, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/sport/ncaa-drop-transfer-rule-division-i-athletes-justice-department/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_sport_josh-gibson-mlb-records-negro-league", "text": "Major League Baseball has incorporated the statistics of former Negro Leagues players into its historical records on its website, meaning legendary leaders in some categories like Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb have now been replaced in the record books by players who were not allowed to play on the same fields as them during segregation. Josh Gibson, one of the greatest sluggers in the history of the Negro Leagues, is now listed as MLB\u2019s new all-time career leader in batting average at .372, moving ahead of Ty Cobb at .367. The MLB website shows Gibson also overtaking Babe Ruth in career slugging percentage. \u201cWe are proud that the official historical record now includes the players of the Negro Leagues. This initiative is focused on ensuring that future generations of fans have access to the statistics and milestones of all those who made the Negro Leagues possible,\u201d said MLB commissioner Rob Manfred in a statement. \u201cTheir accomplishments on the field will be a gateway to broader learning about this triumph in American history and the path that led to Jackie Robinson\u2019s 1947 Dodger debut.\u201d Gibson was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972. \u201cWe\u2019re excited,\u201d Sean Gibson, the slugger\u2019s great grandson, told CNN. \u201cThis is a long time coming. Not just for Josh Gibson, but all the other great Negro League family members as well.\u201d The power-hitting catcher\u2019s Baseball Hall of Fame plaque \u2013 he\u2019s one of 35 Negro League stars enshrined in Cooperstown \u2013 says he \u201chit almost 800 home runs in league and independent baseball\u201d during his 17-year career. However, the majority of those homers came not in league-sanctioned games (about 50 to 75 per season) but in exhibitions played against former big leaguers and White semi-pro teams. \u201cThis is indeed an exciting day. It was a long time coming,\u201d Negro Leagues Baseball Museum President Bob Kendrick said at a Wednesday news conference. \u201cIt is an absolute watershed moment for both Black baseball and Negro League history.\u201d Kendrick continued, \u201cYou cannot reduce the story of the Negro Leagues to statistics. You just can\u2019t. \u201cThis story is far more grandiose than mere statistics. This story in many ways is bigger than the game of baseball.\u201d Kendrick also addressed baseball fans who may be upset their favorite players have moved down in some of the rankings. \u201cThat does not diminish them,\u201d Kendrick said. \u201cIt is just now providing some names that perhaps you should have known about before now and you\u2019re getting the opportunity\u00a0to learn about them.\u201d More than 2,300 Negro Leagues players from 1920-1948 were added to the MLB database as more stats are \u201cstill being discovered.\u201d Also, MLB career statistics for Hall of Famers like Jackie Robinson, Satchel Paige and Minnie Mi\u00f1oso now reflect their Negro Leagues\u2019 accomplishments. For example, Robinson\u2019s 49 hits with the Kansas City Monarchs in 1945 increase his career total from 1,518 to 1,567. Paige\u2019s career wins total goes from 28 to 125 and Mi\u00f1oso\u2019s 150 hits with the New York Cubans raised his career total over the 2,000 hits milestone to 2,113. This comes about three and a half years after\u00a0MLB recognized the Negro Leagues as its equivalent and counted the statistics and records of thousands of Black players\u00a0who played in the Negro Leagues from 1920 to the late 1940s. Even though that recognition happened in December 2020, MLB at the time\u00a0said it needed time to review how that recognition would affect MLB record books. That was in part because some statistics were still being compiled and because MLB needed to sort league-sanctioned games from exhibitions. \u201cShortened Negro League schedules, interspersed with revenue-raising exhibition games, were born of MLB\u2019s exclusionary practices,\u201d John Thorn, MLB historian who chaired the review Negro Leagues Statistical Review Committee, said in a statement. \u201cTo deny the best Black players of the era their rightful place among all-time leaders would be a double penalty.\u201d Baseball historian Larry Lester, who also served on the committee, added: \u201cStories, folklore and embellished truths have long been a staple of the Negro Leagues narrative. Those storylines will always be entertaining, but now our dialogues can be quantified and qualified to support the authentic greatest of these athletes. \u201cEvery fan should welcome this statistical restitution towards social reparation.\u201d MLB in 2020 said it was \u201ccorrecting a longtime oversight\u201d by elevating the status of the Negro Leagues \u2014 which consisted of seven leagues and about 3,400 Black and Latino players from 1920 to 1948. \u201cMany people have heard of Martin Dihigo and Josh Gibson and Satchel Paige. But what about the thousands of other men who played in the Negro Leagues from 1920 to 1948? They\u2019re being recognized finally as major league caliber ballplayers,\u201d Scott Simkus, one of the researchers credited by MLB with compiling and constructing the\u00a0Seamheads Negro Leagues Database, said at the time. \u201cTheir statistical records, their careers are going to be considered equal to anybody who had played in the National League or American League during that period of time.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s sad this great history has been kept from them,\u201d Lester, co-founder of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City, said at the time. Bob Kendrick, president of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, had said the recognition \u201cserves as historical validation for those who had been shunned from the Major Leagues and had the foresight and courage to create their own league that helped change the game and our country, too.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/sport/josh-gibson-mlb-records-negro-league/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Since rising to the top of the rankings, the Polish star has been a dominant force in women\u2019s tennis, winning 16 titles \u2013 21 in total \u2013 and only once dropping from the No. 1 spot for an eight-week period last year. She is unmatched in her ability to sweep aside opponents in brutal fashion, and her habit of winning sets 6-0 \u2013 referred to as a \u201cbagel\u201d \u2013 and 6-1 \u2013 a \u201cbreadstick\u201d \u2013 has led to jokes from tennis fans about \u015awi\u0105tek running a bakery. After claiming back-to-back titles in Madrid and Rome, the 22-year-old is in auspicious form as she attempts to win the fifth grand slam of her young career at the French Open, entering the tournament on a 12-match winning streak. In the current era of women\u2019s tennis, no player has achieved so much in such a short space of time, and even \u015awi\u0105tek admits that her success has been a surprise. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s hard to get a grasp on it because it all happened so fast,\u201d she tells CNN Sport. \u201cWhen I was younger, I wouldn\u2019t even expect myself to be in the top five, (let alone) these kinds of stats. \u201cFor sure, I\u2019m proud of myself and of the team, because without them I wouldn\u2019t be in that place.\u201d \u015awi\u0105tek is most prolific on her preferred surface of clay, and the French Open, where she is a three-time champion, is her favorite of the four grand slams. She has only lost twice at Roland Garros, accumulating 28 wins since her debut in 2019. Whichever qualifier or lucky loser faces \u015awi\u0105tek in the first round could be the next victim. But being the world No. 1 and commanding so much success in a single tournament comes with its own challenges, particularly when you\u2019re the one player in the draw everyone wants to beat. \u201cSometimes I get this feeling off the court a little bit, or when I analyze these matches and I see that these players were super-motivated, more than usual when they played against me,\u201d says \u015awi\u0105tek. \u201cBut on the other hand, when you\u2019re on court, you don\u2019t have time to think about things like that \u2026 The best way, honestly, is really taking it step-by-step, not looking at the draws and not thinking what can happen in the quarterfinals or semifinals because there\u2019s still a long way (to go).\u201d Having spent more than 100 weeks as the world No. 1, \u015awi\u0105tek is growing used to the added pressures and responsibilities of being the world\u2019s top-ranked player. The process, however, has been a learning curve: as well as handling her high expectations for every tournament, she has had to deal with increased focus from the media and the demands of her widening portfolio of sponsors. For a self-described introvert, that hasn\u2019t always been straightforward. \u201cPeople really accept that I\u2019m an introvert and sometimes I like things quiet and not too much noise around me,\u201d says \u015awi\u0105tek. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to really take it easy and manage all these obligations well so it\u2019s not too much.\u201d One way of handling these demands has been working closely with her sports psychologist, Daria Abramowicz, who travels around the world as part of \u015awi\u0105tek\u2019s team of trainers. The focus is primarily on performance \u2013 improving concentration, dealing with high-pressure environments, and learning how to stay calm on the court \u2013 but Abramowicz\u2019s influence also extends beyond that. \u201cWhen we started working in 2019, I was really, really introverted,\u201d says \u015awi\u0105tek. \u201cShe helped me to feel more comfortable in the world around me, and I think without that part of the work that we did, I wouldn\u2019t be able to handle all this pressure and attention that you get when you become world No. 1. \u201cShe\u2019s the kind of person that will kind of tell me, \u2018Oh, Iga, I think you\u2019re doing too much, you need to really focus on your game right now because I see that it\u2019s harder for you to concentrate,\u2019 or things like that.\u201d Among \u015awi\u0105tek\u2019s list of sponsors are Porsche, Rolex, LEGO \u2013 which she uses as part of her mental preparation \u2013 and cosmetic brand Lanc\u00f4me \u2013 with whom she is the first athlete to sign a worldwide ambassador deal. Last year, she became the first female athlete to be sponsored by sportswear brand On and has helped to develop the company inaugural tennis range. \u201cI feel really taken care of,\u201d says \u015awi\u0105tek of the partnership, \u201cwhich is sometimes a struggle when you work with companies that have 20 other athletes just in one sport.\u201d \u201cBeyond Number One,\u201d a short film produced by On about her rise to the summit of tennis, released earlier this week. Given her sustained success in recent years, it\u2019s no surprise that \u015awi\u0105tek has attracted so much attention from sponsors. She was named as Forbes\u2019 highest-paid female athlete last year having earned $23.9 million \u2013 $9.9 million in prize money and $14 million off the court \u2013 topping the list ahead of Chinese freestyle skier Eileen Gu and American rival Coco Gauff. Tennis players, including Emma Raducanu, Naomi Osaka, and Aryna Sabalenka, made up nine of the top 10 and 12 of the top 20 on Forbes\u2019 list. \u201cShe has been really the first player since Serena (Williams) and (Maria) Sharapova retired that has been consistent week in and week out, competing to win grand slams every time she steps on the court,\u201d Max Eisenbud, \u015awi\u0105tek\u2019s agent at IMG, tells CNN Sport about the reasons for her commercial success. \u201cI think that consistency in play has certainly separated her and made her very attractive to potential endorsers \u2026 Brands like that she\u2019s real \u2013 she is who she is \u2013 and I think that\u2019s refreshing. Sometimes when you get into this whole social media world, this whole influencer world, it\u2019s not the case with realness.\u201d For \u015awi\u0105tek, that \u201crealness\u201d means talking openly about her love for Taylor Swift, LEGO \u2013 last year, she was gifted a model of Rome\u2019s Colosseum for her birthday \u2013 or reading in the park. She enjoyed the autobiographies of Andre Agassi and Lindsey Vonn but generally prefers fiction to sports books. \u201cI sometimes have too much sport in my life,\u201d \u015awi\u0105tek admits. Eisenbud calls her a \u201cdream client\u201d and \u201cone of the most professional athletes I\u2019ve ever been around.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s waking up every day and thinking about how to be great, and that\u2019s from her diet to her sleep to her decisions that she\u2019s making,\u201d he adds. This dedicated, detailed approach has helped to create the best all-around game in women\u2019s tennis right now \u2013 aggressive groundstrokes, a vicious, topspin-laden forehand, and canny movement around the court. At Roland Garros, \u015awi\u0105tek could become only the third woman to win three consecutive titles in the Open Era after Monica Seles and Justine Henin \u2013 potentially another landmark on her impressive resume. She would be 23 by then but already with more titles and accolades than most tennis players could dream of; after her own, modest childhood ambitions, the possibilities for \u015awi\u0105tek\u2019s career seem limitless.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/sport/iga-swiatek-profile-french-open-tennis-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_sport_hattan-alsaif-mma-saudi-arabia-spt-intl", "text": "Hattan Alsaif has grown accustomed to sparring with men. Rarely shy about confronting heavier, stronger opponents, she knows what it\u2019s like to absorb blow after blow until tears begin to shine in her eyes, her face red and hot from crying. As one of the few women at her gym in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia \u2013 and the only woman hopeful of fighting at an elite level \u2013 Alsaif had little choice but to train with and against her male counterparts when she first took up martial arts. She credits her sometimes brutal introduction to the sport as one of the reasons for her success. \u201cI was the only girl doing it day and night, day and night, day and night,\u201d Alsaif told CNN Sport. \u201cI always spar with guys, I train with guys, I\u2019m always with the guys in the gym. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy thing, so when it comes to the cage, when I get a hit from a girl, I feel like, \u2018Whoa, is this all you\u2019ve got?\u2019\u201d The 22-year-old had already made history in MMA, even before her atomweight bout against Egypt\u2019s Nada Faheem on Friday, which she won by knock out in the second round. In January, Alsaif signed a contract with the Professional Fighters League (PFL), making her the first woman from Saudi Arabia to join a global MMA promotion. It was a notable moment in a country known for its socially conservative attitudes, where sporting opportunities have historically been limited for women. The Saudi women\u2019s soccer team only played its first match two years ago, while a domestic soccer league wasn\u2019t established until 2020. Alsaif is acutely aware of her status as a trailblazer for female MMA fighters in Saudi Arabia and takes such a responsibility seriously. \u201cIt\u2019s big, to be honest, because I\u2019m going to be carrying this thing my entire life,\u201d she said, speaking to CNN before her MMA debut fight on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit heavy to carry it, but I\u2019m excited and proud to be the person to do it.\u201d Alsaif endured a difficult upbringing, orphaned at the age of 10 after both of her parents died in a short space of time. She says she battled depression during her teenage years before finding solace in martial arts, helping her to discover a sense of purpose and peace. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a normal childhood or an easy childhood because of the loss of my parents,\u201d said Alsaif. \u201cBut after God, martial arts helped me a lot \u2013 so, so, so much. It changed my life 100% for the better. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m so addicted to martial arts. I don\u2019t want to stop doing [it] because it\u2019s just the thing that makes me feel alive. I feel I\u2019m alive when I train, when I fight, in the gym \u2013 I can feel my soul alive. \u201cWhen I breathe after the rounds, when I feel sick, when I feel tired, when I feel courage, when I feel scared, those moments, every part of that, it makes me feel alive. It\u2019s something that means a lot to me.\u201d Growing up, Alsaif had always loved extreme, adrenaline-fueled sports, and her curiosity to try something new took her to a boxing gym in her local neighborhood. That piqued her interest, but she soon found that the boxing class she was attending lacked rigor and professionalism. Then, after seeing videos of Saudi MMA fighter Abdullah Al-Qahtani on social media, the pair exchanged messages and Alsaif was invited to try the sport for herself. \u201cI started looking at the guys, and they were hitting the bags with kicks and elbows and knees,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI was like, they have more weapons than I do. I only have hands [in boxing]. I felt so jealous \u2026 I love to do the things that have more power.\u201d Alsaif started to compete in Muay Thai \u2013 the stand-up, striking combat sport originating in Thailand \u2013 and went on to win titles at the World Combat Games, the Saudi Games and the International Federation of Muaythai Associations (IFMA) World Championships under the guidance of coach Feras Sadaa. Sadaa, coach of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Muay Thai national team, has been central to Alsaif\u2019s success, though his influence extends far beyond a sporting sphere. \u201cAll these years, I never felt what [having a] father means at all,\u201d said Alsaif. \u201cAnd he was a gift from God. He did everything with me. He helped me in every situation, in the gym or outside of the gym. \u201cHe was like family. He always told anyone else that Hattan is not just my student, Hattan is one of my kids \u2026 I wish to make him so happy [and] represent him in the best way I can.\u201d Friday\u2019s fight card in Riyadh, headlined by Al-Qahtani, was Alsaif\u2019s first chance to assess whether she was able to translate her Muay Thai prowess into success in an MMA cage. The event, part of the PFL\u2019s growing prominence in the region, featured fighters from across the Middle East and North Africa, less than three months since Claressa Shields and Kelsey De Santis contested the first professional female MMA bout in Saudi Arabia. Last year, SURJ Sports Investments Company, which is owned by Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF), acquired a minority stake in the PFL, part of the PFL\u2019s strategy to recruit more fighters and attract more fans in the MENA region. Alsaif never envisioned herself becoming an MMA pioneer when she took her first curious steps into a combat gym, but said that she wants to leave a legacy in the sport. Her upcoming bout is the first step towards achieving that goal and also an opportunity to reflect on all that she has overcome during her short time as an MMA fighter. She does that between rounds in the gym, wiping any tears from her eyes and reminding herself of the effort and energy she has so far devoted to her pursuit. \u201cI start looking at myself in the mirror and I\u2019d be like, \u2018You have killed yourself; you have cried; you have sacrificed everything,\u2019\u201d said Alsaif. \u201c\u2018You are really strong; you are your own role model\u2019 \u2026 It does give me a lot of motivation.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/sport/hattan-alsaif-mma-saudi-arabia-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_sport_chris-birch-nasa-astronaut-cycling-spt-scn-intl", "text": "Scroll through the athlete profiles on the USA Cycling website and you\u2019ll find someone whose favorite movie is listed as \u201cInterstellar\u201d \u2013 Christopher Nolan\u2019s acclaimed sci-fi adventure released in 2014. \u201cI love realistic space movies \u2026 I\u2019m definitely a nerd,\u201d reads Chris Birch\u2019s answer on her profile page. That response proved prescient: shortly after stepping away from her professional cycling career, the Arizona native was selected from more than 12,000 applicants to join NASA\u2019s astronaut class of 2021. As career sidesteps go, it was an unusual one, though Birch had an extensive background in science with degrees in mathematics, biochemistry and molecular biophysics, and a doctorate in biological engineering. The further she progressed with her application to join NASA, the more convinced she became that she had a future in spaceflight. Interviews with panels of current and former astronauts, she thought, were stimulating, not intimidating, and so too were the selection exercises undertaken with other candidates. \u201cI really just had a blast,\u201d Birch tells CNN Sport. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like an interview at all, it didn\u2019t feel like a test. It was just super fun. And it felt like fun and games for me.\u201d It\u2019s now been close to two and a half years since Birch joined NASA, and in that time, she has practiced for space walks, learned to fly T-38 training jets and developed skills needed to operate the robotic arm on the International Space Station. Her training also involved acquiring expeditionary skills, understanding how to operate the complex systems on the space station, and even becoming proficient in Russian, the language needed to fly the Soyuz spacecraft. When she graduated at Houston\u2019s Johnson Space Center in March, the 37-year-old had few qualms about the unexpected U-turn her career had taken, her appetite for spaceflight keener than ever before. \u201cI absolutely would love to explore off this planet,\u201d says Birch. \u201cI think there\u2019s a pretty good shot that I\u2019ll get to go do science aboard the International Space Station, maybe even get to do some wrenching outside and work on making some upgrades. \u201cIt would be an absolute career highlight to be able to go back to the moon as part of one of the Artemis missions and do science on the moon.\u201d Birch left academia in 2018 to pursue a career in professional cycling, going on to win 11 national titles and represent the US at the world championships on several occasions. It was around the time that she was training to make the team for the postponed Tokyo Olympics that Birch applied to join NASA, and when she missed out on selection for the Games, she decided to throw herself wholly into her new pursuit. Despite the evident differences in cycling and spaceflight, she believes that the same sense of curiosity and wonder has motivated her in both disciplines. \u201cI think there\u2019s something really powerful about being surrounded by a group of people that are all trying deliberately to not walk the path most trodden,\u201d says Birch. \u201cWe\u2019re all looking to push the envelope in some way, and that has always been my driving mantra. The whole reason I pursued a PhD is I wanted to discover something, to build something that had never been done before. \u201cMy fascination with sport was all about seeing how fast we could go. Can we push the human body \u2013 my body, my mind \u2013 farther than I thought I could go? It really was a natural extension of that inner drive for me, if not a slight change in the technical topics.\u201d Joining NASA has meant that Birch\u2019s days of flying around a velodrome at lightning-bolt speeds are over, but her desire to test her physical limits remains. She has turned her focus towards endurance challenges, completing the iconic Leadville Trail 100 mountain bike race \u2013 a 100-mile course with 12,000 feet of elevation gain in Colorado \u2013 last year, as well as racing the Houston Marathon in January. On her radar is an attempt to break the women\u2019s time record for cycling north to south across Montana, some 400 miles on gravel roads. Challenges like that are not so far removed from astronaut training, which involves group expeditions in the field, living in the wilderness for days at a time and learning how to handle stress in a critical, unforgiving environment. \u201cCycling in particular \u2013 it just supports so much suffering,\u201d says Birch. \u201cIt\u2019s a really great avenue to practice mental toughness. It doesn\u2019t cost much, versus for me to go out and fly in a multi-engine jet aircraft is thousands of dollars an hour. \u201cThis is something that I can go do and practice that toughness training, especially if I\u2019m descending on a mountain bike trail, six hours in and I\u2019m really tired \u2013 I\u2019m now making critical handling decisions in response to my environment. \u201cI feel like that translates really well to being able to do that in the jet \u2013 it\u2019s the same mental clarity, mental focus you have to maintain. I think it\u2019s an awesome space to practice that.\u201d Birch is now firmly focused on her first projects since graduating. Recently, that\u2019s involved supporting Artemis II recovery training in the Pacific Ocean, off the coast from California. The Artemis II mission, now scheduled for September 2025 after a delay of several months, aims to send four astronauts on a journey to fly by the moon, and being able to prepare for the safe recovery of the astronauts and the capsule, Birch says, gave an \u201cincredible appreciation for the needs of the crew,\u201d even while she\u2019s still a rookie. There\u2019s no obvious timeline or pathway for when or how she might be able to venture away from planet Earth herself, but it remains a firm ambition in her life and career. \u201cI\u2019m going to prepare for that the same way I would prepare for a race,\u201d says Birch, \u201cshow up every day and give 100% to the team. If the timing works out, then that\u2019s great. But I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/sport/chris-birch-nasa-astronaut-cycling-spt-scn-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_sport_kylian-mbappe-interview-spt-intl", "text": "He\u2019s a World Cup winner, who has won multiple titles with French club Paris Saint-Germain over the last seven years. Now, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, who is widely expected to imminently join Real Madrid, says he\u2019s looking forward to the challenge of playing in a new country. \u201cI want to be happy,\u201d Mbapp\u00e9 told CNN Sport\u2019s Amanda Davies after being crowned Best Men\u2019s Player at the inaugural Globe Soccer Awards Europe Edition in Sardinia, Italy, on Tuesday. \u201cI will leave my country for the first time,\u201d added Mbapp\u00e9. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be an amazing experience and I can\u2019t wait to be in my new club. I want to win trophies \u2026 When you speak about football, [it\u2019s about] winning trophies, being with new teammates. \u201cNow, I have my contract with PSG \u2026 Everybody knows that it\u2019s soon finishing and we\u2019re going to see what happens.\u201d It was earlier this month that confirmation came that the 25-year-old, who is the second most expensive soccer player in history, wouldn\u2019t be extending his stay with French giant PSG. The first time Real came calling for Mbapp\u00e9 was when the forward was just 13 years old. In his comic book, \u201cJe m\u2019appelle Kylian (I\u2019m called Kylian),\u201d Mbapp\u00e9 describes his dreams of one day playing in the famed white shirt of Los Blancos. And when Real submitted a $188 million bid for the striker in August 2021 \u2013 a deal that was close to being agreed \u2013 the Frenchman admitted at the time that he wanted to leave PSG. Mbapp\u00e9 eventually made a U-turn by signing a three-year contract extension with PSG in May 2022, temporarily pausing one of soccer\u2019s biggest transfer sagas. So was it the right decision to stay in Paris? \u201cIt was more than just staying at PSG. It was the World Cup in Qatar. It was many things around these things. It was a big decision, difficult decision \u2026 but I don\u2019t regret anything,\u201d said Mbapp\u00e9. \u201cOf course, in a career, you have to take difficult decisions and it\u2019s what I did, but I became the all-time top scorer with PSG. I just want to remember the best things \u2026 It was not an easy situation and I wish nobody to live that.\u201d Speaking with CNN Sport, PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi paid tribute to Mbapp\u00e9 ahead of his impending departure from the club. \u201cI wish him all the best. He\u2019s done amazing for us for seven years. He was vice captain, he came to us at 18 years old or less and now he is a big man, the best player in the world,\u201d Al-Khelaifi said. \u201cYou never know, maybe one day he comes back to France, that\u2019s football,\u201d he added. \u201cHe only deserves good things.\u201d Real Madrid, meanwhile, has long had a history of having some of the game\u2019s biggest superstars in its ranks. The 2000-06 Gal\u00e1cticos squad boasted the likes of Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo Naz\u00e1rio, Lu\u00eds Figo and David Beckham, before the second incarnation came in 2009 in the form of record-breaking signings Cristiano Ronaldo and Kak\u00e1 \u2013 not to mention signing a young Karim Benzema from Lyon. The young Frenchman seems to have been earmarked as the player to headline a new wave of star power alongside the likes of Vin\u00edcius Jr. and Jude Bellingham. Those two players will be bidding to help Real win a record-extending 15th European Cup on Saturday when Los Merengues face Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League final in London\u2019s Wembley Stadium. Will Mbapp\u00e9 be cheering on his prospective new employer and teammates? \u201cNo \u2013 I\u2019ll just watch the final like you,\u201d he smiled. \u201cWhen you love football, you watch every game. I watch every game when I can \u2026 in France, England, Spain, Germany, Italy. Every league. So, of course, I\u2019m going to watch the Champions League.\u201d \u2018It\u2019s part of the journey\u2019 Champions League glory has so far eluded Mbapp\u00e9 in what is otherwise an astounding trophy-laden career. The closest he and PSG got was the 2020 final in Lisbon, when the team lost 1-0 to Bayern Munich. \u201cI think it\u2019s part of the journey,\u201d he says. \u201cI have, of course, many opportunities more to win the Champions League, but I think it\u2019s part of your destiny. \u201cWe were close a few times \u2026 It\u2019s part of the game. Now, I\u2019m in the position that I only want to have good feelings, good memories about my journey in Paris and everything that happened in this club and don\u2019t forget about the small details.\u201d Paris is where Mbapp\u00e9 the boy became Mbapp\u00e9 the man. After leaving AS Monaco as a fresh-faced 18-year-old, the superstar has achieved numerous individual and team accolades with PSG. He leaves the French capital having won six Ligue 1 titles, four French Cups, two League Cups and a record five Player of the Year awards. And, on top of that, he\u2019s a World Cup winner. \u201cIf I\u2019m the player who I am now \u2026 I have to thank PSG,\u201d said Mbapp\u00e9. \u201cWhen I arrived there [at 18], I was just a young guy who wanted to be someone in world football. \u201cI did one year in Monaco. Of course, it was great. We won the league and went to the semifinal of the Champions [League], but I did nothing important in the world of football. \u201c[PSG was] an amazing opportunity. I\u2019m French, I\u2019m from Paris, so it was something special. Seven years \u2026 That\u2019s a lot in a career, even more in modern football \u2026 It was a special feeling for me to be part of this club.\u201d \u2018I want to really improve my game\u2019 While some will judge his career in terms of goals, trophies and accolades, Mbapp\u00e9 sees his imprint on the sport in a bigger, historical perspective. \u201cI have a lot of things to give to football,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve done many things, but I\u2019m still young and I want to do more \u2026 I want to put my name in the history of football. \u201cI just watch what I have in the future, and I want to really improve my game, to be a better player every year and to be the player who I want to be. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about goals, not just about trophies, it\u2019s about the feeling that you give to people, the emotion, and the way you can be a complete player, the way you can help your teammates to be better. \u201cI want to understand more the game, more the world of football, everything. I have more experience so that\u2019s helped me to be better.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/sport/kylian-mbappe-interview-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "sports"}}
