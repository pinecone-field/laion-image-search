Varga fell to the ground after appearing to collide with Scotland goalkeeper Angus Gunn in the Scotland box midway through the second half. The 29-year-old\u2019s teammates could be seen signaling for medical attention to be brought onto the pitch to help Varga. When it arrived, sheets were raised around him while he received treatment. Subsequently, 10 minutes of stoppage time was added to the end of the Group A match at the Stuttgart Arena. Cameras showed Szoboszlai seemingly in tears after the incident and appeared to be concerned at the speed at which the stretcher was being carried onto the pitch to help Varga. The Hungary captain then helped run with the stretcher in an effort to speed up the process. Varga was eventually taken off the field to applause from both sets of fans. Shortly after the game \u2013 in which Hungary\u2019s Kevin Csoboth scored a 100th-minute winner to give them a chance of qualifying for the knockout stages of the competition \u2013 the Hungarian FA confirmed that Varga was in a \u201cstable\u201d condition in a nearby hospital and that he had concussion and a broken cheekbone which required surgery. \u201cIt looked bad, it was bad, he felt bad,\u201d Szoboszlai told reporters as he reflected on Varga\u2019s injury. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what the [medical] protocol [is], I don\u2019t know how it works but if our doctors say we need someone immediately to help, then I don\u2019t think they should walk. \u201cIt\u2019s not my decision but I think we need to change something. Even if somebody is on the ground, and you see that it was a big crash then just go [onto the pitch]. Even if the referee is saying don\u2019t go on, just go on. And if you see it\u2019s nothing serious, then you can just go down and its finished. But seconds can help a lot.\u201d When contacted by CNN about whether it was reviewing its medical procedures, UEFA \u2013 European soccer\u2019s governing body \u2013 said in a statement: \u201cWith regards to the medical intervention following the head injury suffered by Barnab\u00e1s Varga of Hungary, we would like to clarify that the intervention of the team doctor happened within 15 seconds of the incident, followed immediately by the second stadium doctor, to conduct a first assessment of the injury and provide appropriate treatment, as per customary medical procedures. \u201cThe qualified pitchside emergency team were waiting pitchside, according to their protocol, and arrived with the stretcher as soon as their intervention was requested by the medics to evacuate the player for his immediate transfer to hospital. \u201cThe coordination between all the medical staff on site was professional and everything was done in accordance with the applicable medical procedures. There was no delay in the treatment of and assistance to the player.\u201d Csoboth celebrated his late winner with a shirt with Varga\u2019s name on the back and the whole team posed with a similar shirt after the victory in support for the striker. \u201cIt was a confusing situation,\u201d Hungary coach Marco Rossi told reporters after the match. \u201cWhat I heard from the players is that Barny at that moment looked like he was not conscious so everyone was really worried about his condition and also worried about the fact that the doctors arrived a bit late, we can say. \u201cBut of course, they probably didn\u2019t realize it was a dangerous situation. Now fortunately, we can say that Barny is not under any kind of risk. \u201cProbably he will be operated in the coming hours because he suffered a fracture here [pointing to his cheek/eye socket]. But he\u2019s healthy, that\u2019s the most important thing. If we go through the competition of course he will not be part of the team anymore.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/sport/barnabas-varga-injury-szoboszlai-hungary-scotland-euro-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}

{"id": "2022_07_25_sport_black-representation-swimming-equality-spt-intl", "text": "Omie Dale has fond memories of splashing in the sea as a child, of racing through water parks and swimming in backwaters and rivers.   \u201cThere\u2019s so much joy that can be had once you learn to swim, once you\u2019ve abandoned those fears and you can get in the water,\u201d the 25-year-old Dale, who is based in southeast London, tells CNN Sport.  Even though swimming is a joyful experience for Dale, the stark reality is that many Black communities in Britain and the US do not have safe access to swimming lessons and public pools due to historic racism and segregation \u2013 a problem that is especially alarming given that, as Dale says, it is \u201cthe only sport that can save your life.\u201d  A history of exclusion The lack of access afforded to Black communities in Britain is what motivated Dale to become a swimming teacher in September 2019.  \u201cI used to work in Kensington (in London) as a lifeguard and some of the richest people live in that borough, but also some of the poorest,\u201d she says. She saw there was a difference when private schools and independent schools would come in and all the kids were able to swim, yet hardly any children of the same age that Dale saw from state schools could swim 25 meters.  \u201cThere\u2019s a real class barrier in the sport of swimming,\u201d Dale adds.   She is a director of Swimunity, a collective offering free swimming lessons to women and children in North Kensington, West London. It was born in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster in 2017, when a residential block caught on fire, killing 72 people \u2013 and leaving many more without homes.   \u201cThere\u2019s like a lot of people who come to swim lessons \u2026 who have undergone some form of trauma, whether that be water-related trauma or trauma related to their everyday lives,\u201d Dale says.   \u201cMany people say it\u2019s like an escape from their daily lives or is, actually, the first time that they\u2019ve taken time for themselves.\u201d  While 77% of children from the most affluent families in England can swim 25 meters unaided, only 34% from the least affluent families can, according to a 2021 survey from Sport England, a non-departmental public body that fosters grassroots sports in England.  About 95% of Black adults and 80% of Black children in England do not regularly participate in swimming, according to Sport England\u2019s report, published in January 2020. Likewise, about 93% of Asian adults and 78% of Asian children, including those with Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi heritage, do not regularly participate in swimming, the same research found. This trend extends to the US, where nearly 64% of Black children have \u201clow\u201d or no ability to swim, compared with 40% of their White peers, according to 2017 data from the country\u2019s national governing body for the sport at a competitive level, USA Swimming.   The underrepresentation of Black people in the pool in the US can be traced back to the early 20th century.   Public swimming pools became popular in North America in the 1920s and 30s and were initially open to all. However, Northern politicians stipulated a \u201cWhites Only\u201d rule, referencing racist fears about Black men fraternizing with White women.   Even after legal racial segregation ended in the US in 1964, public pools continued to be hostile environments. As people of color began to use public pools, White swimmers retreated to the privacy of their own pools and private clubs, where expensive fees continue to be an economic barrier for Black families who cannot afford the cost.    Similar examples in Britain illustrate how racial and class inequalities lead to the systemic exclusion of Black people in pools. For example, more than 4.2 million people in the UK live in ethnically diverse communities where Covid-19 national lockdowns resulted in the closure or mothballing of pools, according to Swim England \u2013 England\u2019s national swimming governing body \u2013 and the Black Swimming Association (BSA), a UK-based charity that aims to encourage more African, Caribbean and Asian communities to take up swimming.  \u2018We cannot keep recovering bodies\u2019  Globally, drowning is the third leading cause of accidental injury-related death and at least 236,000 people die each year from drowning, according to 2019 data from the World Health Organization (WHO). Children are particularly affected, with drowning being one of the top five causes of death for those aged 1-14 years in 48 of 85 countries studied by the WHO.   And while natural disasters and irregular migration are notorious risk factors, so are lower socioeconomic status, lack of higher education and being a member of an ethnic minority, depending on the country, WHO research shows.  \u201cMost drowning incidents happen when people never intend to get into the water in the first place,\u201d says Dale, who was awarded Swim Teacher of the Year by Swim England in 2021.  In December 2019, three members of the same Black British family \u2013 a 53-year-old father and his two children \u2013 died in a swimming pool at a resort in Costa del Sol, Spain, Reuters reported. The father and his 16-year-old son had reportedly leapt into the water to try to save his nine-year-old daughter, who was drowning.   Danielle Obe is the co-founder and chair of the BSA. She told CNN Sport that the Costa del Sol deaths prompted her to establish the BSA in March 2020, alongside Olympic swimmer Alice Dearing, journalist Seren Jones and songwriter, rapper and producer Ed Accura.    \u201cThis was devastating because these families were actually acquainted to me and they were from my local community,\u201d Obe says. \u201c(At) that point, I called Alice and Seren, and I said, \u2018We\u2019ve been talking about doing something for our community. We\u2019ve got to do something. We\u2019ve got to do it now. We cannot keep recovering bodies.\u2019\u201d   \u201cIt\u2019s no longer just about that lack of representation,\u201d Obe adds.   \u201cIt\u2019s now about saving lives, vital water safety, education for all. Swimming is an intervention. Swimming is a life skill.\u201d  However, there is still a lack of data when it comes to drowning-related deaths by ethnicity in the UK, says Obe.  \u201cAt the moment, we don\u2019t know how much of a disparity there is between drowning and fatalities, aquatic fatalities for different communities in the UK because, up until now, drowning data isn\u2019t really captured by ethnicity, which is another point, another issue that the BSA is looking to tackle.\u201d \u2018People just don\u2019t think Black people should swim\u2019  Dearing, the first Black female swimmer to represent Britain at the Olympics when she competed at Tokyo 2020, \u201cimplores\u201d people to learn to swim.   \u201cI have been quite torn between the amazing achievement of being the first Black woman to represent GB in swimming but wanting to be my own person, my own athlete, who\u2019s known for being an athlete and not for her race and her sport combined together,\u201d she tells CNN Sport. \u201cI take the two of them just as they are \u2013 kind of like separate things. I\u2019m trying to be the best athlete and best role model that I can be to show people that they can do the sport, that the sport is for everybody.\u201d At the age of 24, Dearing was making history in Japan and became a beacon of hope for young people \u2013 especially Black girls \u2013 who wanted to break into the sport.   But her personal triumph also drew attention to the institutional access gap for people of color in swimming.    \u201cFortunately, for myself, I haven\u2019t come across any barriers at the level I\u2019m at currently,\u201d Dearing says.   \u201cBut I have faced barriers when I was younger and issues where people just don\u2019t think Black people should swim, or do swim, or think that we\u2019re better suited to other sports and so shouldn\u2019t even learn to swim or attempt swimming in the first place.\u201d  CNN reached out to the International Swimming Federation (FINA), Sport England and USA Swimming requesting a breakdown of Black and ethnic minority participation in swimming at grassroots and professional levels of the sport. However, they told CNN they were unable to provide such data.  FINA \u2013 the global governing body for swimming \u2013 told CNN it does not have a breakdown of the ethnicities of swimmers at a grassroots or elite level.   FINA said in 2021 it allocated $6.6 million towards development programs for distribution among all national federations and continental associations, while also pushing for diversity in the sport through its \u201cSwimming for All, Swimming for Life\u201d program.   \u201cFINA remains fully committed to non-discrimination,\u201d the organization said to CNN in a statement. \u201cFINA continues to work hard to ensure that the global aquatics community is a place where all athletes, coaches and administrators are treated equally. \u201cWork will continue to develop and grow with the support of members of the aquatics community as we strive to be at the forefront of this essential area,\u201d FINA added.    Sport England told CNN in a statement that it is \u201ccommitted to increasing investment in facilities and organisations across England to try to level up access to good quality sports and activities.\u201d \u201cBarriers to getting active persist and have even been exacerbated for some disadvantaged groups \u2013 like women, people with long-term health conditions, disabled people, people from ethnically diverse communities and lower socio-economic groups,\u201d the statement added.   Sport England said in May it announced further funding that brings its total investment in its 121 partners to more than \u00a3550 million ($670 million), which they\u2019ve selected \u201cdue to their unique position to tackle entrenched activity inequalities and influence positive change throughout the sector, their own networks and beyond.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s not all about the economic side of things. It is also about getting people to feel comfortable with putting their kids in swim lessons and in competitive swimming so that they can then go and do other aquatic-based sports,\u201d Joel Shinofield, the managing director of sport development at USA Swimming, told CNN during a phone call.  USA Swimming is a membership-serviced organization that has over 3,100 clubs and more than 400,000 members, according to the official website.   \u201cOur goal is to facilitate opportunities and make sure they\u2019re good ones. While our clubs are the ones that do that on the local level, the resources, guidance, support, financial investment that we provide can shift who those opportunities can be provided to and more broadly create access,\u201d he added.   Shinofield said that USA Swimming has established a 10-year initiative that will grant $1 million to develop learn-to-swim and competitive opportunities for communities served by Historical Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The program was announced in 2021, according to the USA Swimming official website.   Serving underrepresented communities  From representing their organization at the UK\u2019s first Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Summit For Sport in Birmingham, England earlier this year to facilitating swimming classes in Hackney \u2013 one of the most deprived boroughs in London \u2013 Obe hopes that the BSA will help bridge the barrier through community-level engagement.   \u201cThat community engagement really is to build trust, accountability and collaboration with disenfranchised communities and the sector,\u201d says Obe.  \u201cOnly in understanding these attitudes and understanding some of the barriers that preclude our communities from engaging in aquatics can we begin to drive change.\u201d  In August 2021, the BSA announced it would conduct a research program with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the University of Portsmouth, exploring the behaviors and barriers that prevent African, Caribbean and Asian communities from swimming.    Speaking about the program, Obe says: \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to inspire confidence with African, Caribbean and Asian communities, and the only way we\u2019re able to do that is to ensure that we understand where these communities are in the first place and understand why they don\u2019t engage in aquatics, why we don\u2019t see the representation pool side and why we don\u2019t even see the representation within some aquatic organizations.\u201d  Dale also volunteers with Mental Health Swims, a grassroots organization that facilitates swimming meet-ups for people struggling with their mental health. As part of her work for the organization, she coordinates swim events in south London to help swimmers access the mental health benefits of the sport. She also volunteers for Pride in Water, a network that aims to increase LGBTQ+ representation in swimming.   \u2018The future is bright\u2019  Dearing says that despite the racial and economic barriers to swimming for African, Caribbean and Asian communities, she\u2019s still optimistic about the changing landscape of the sport.  \u201cI really think if anything is going to change, it\u2019s going to be now, it\u2019s going to be over the next couple of years,\u201d she says. \u201cEach story is different, each person is different and has to be understood in their own way, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, that\u2019s just another challenge that we have to face and we\u2019re up for it.  \u201cIt\u2019s tough \u2013 it\u2019s not a quick fix, but the future is bright.  \u201cI like to feel that I\u2019m giving something back to swimming and, hopefully, giving something to the Black community to hopefully achieve, strive for and change the way that Black people are viewed in swimming and the way Black people view swimming.  \u201cIt\u2019s a double-edged sword; I absolutely love doing it. Sometimes, it\u2019s really frightening and daunting, but if I\u2019m trying to make the world a better place, then sometimes you got to step out and scare yourself.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/07/25/sport/black-representation-swimming-equality-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}

There is a lot of security and a lot of protection and I don\u2019t think that should happen. And probably we should give a message to the fans that it\u2019s not right way; you\u2019re not going to get anything out of it and probably the measures will get worse for the future.\u201d UEFA, European soccer\u2019s governing body, told CNN that safety and security were its \u201cultimate priority\u201d and that \u201cadditional safety measures will be deployed in the stadiums to further meet the requirements of the tournament, and to prevent such incidents.\u201d At first, a young pitch invader made his way across to Ronaldo who happily posed for a selfie and grinned as the boy tried to sprint away from the stewards who eventually led him off. But then when a second older fan had the same idea and put his arm around Ronaldo as he took a selfie while the stewards tried to shake him off, the Portuguese star threw his hands up in frustration. Later, other fans were tackled by several stewards before they reached Ronaldo, though one steward inadvertently tackled Portugal\u2019s Gon\u00e7alo Ramos as he rushed to get to the fan, and the striker fell onto the grass.

{"id": "2024_06_18_sport_paris-olympics-seine-triathlon-bacteria-intl", "text": "A reference point for Parisians and tourists alike, the River Seine will be the crown jewel of the Olympics this summer, staging events such as the triathlon as well as the opening ceremony, which for the first time in Olympic history will not be taking place in a stadium. Starting at Pont Alexandre III Bridge, the individual triathlon races are set to begin with a 1.5-kilometer swim, followed by a 40K bike race \u2013 passing by the Le Grand Palais and Champs-Elys\u00e9es \u2013 before finishing with a 10K run through the heart of the city. A mixed team relay race involving four athletes \u2013 two men and two women \u2013 will also start at Pont Alexandre III Bridge with each team member completing a 300-meter swim, followed by a 5.8K bike ride and 1.8K run. If all goes to plan, it will be a historic moment, given that swimming in the Seine has been illegal for more than 100 years due to the river\u2019s pollution levels, though some swimming has been permitted recently as part of triathlon test events. But some are warning that there are still potential dangers lurking below the river\u2019s shimmery surface. Recent testing results shared with CNN by technology company Fluidion show that the Seine is still not safe for swimming as per the standards set by World Triathlon, due to high E. Coli bacteria levels in the water, potentially exposing athletes to serious health risks. Authorities have spent at least \u20ac1.4 billion ($1.55 billion) to clean up the Seine. Last month, a rainwater storage facility was opened that can hold 20 Olympic swimming pools worth of water to reduce pressure on the sewage network and lower the risk of wastewater being discharged into the Seine, according to a statement from Paris 2024. Meanwhile, triathlon teams around the world are preparing for the worst and hoping for the best. \u201cFor me, it will be very frustrating and very shaming for France, Paris and the Olympics if we can\u2019t do a triathlon,\u201d French-born triathlete Jeanne Lehair told CNN in a telephone interview. What does the latest testing show? The city of Paris is working with its own laboratory to monitor the Olympic Seine site, but technology company Fluidion, founded in Paris in 2012, has also been checking the water quality of the river several times a week at Pont Alexandre III Bridge. The Seine serves as Fluidion\u2019s primary research site, according to the company, hence why they routinely collect water samples for internal research efforts. CNN has not independently verified the organization\u2019s findings. Fluidion\u2019s testing has found that, on average, E. Coli levels in the Siene between early April\u00a0and late May were just under 3400 MPN/100mL. According to CNN\u2019s calculation, this is more than three times higher than the level needed for \u201cgood\u201d water quality, as per World Triathlon standards. \u201cWe have experienced a very rainy past couple of months, causing numerous combined sewer overflows in Paris and upstream,\u201d Dan Angelescu, CEO of Fluidion, told CNN on May 31 via email, adding that the impact on water quality is evident, with \u201cnoticeable bacterial spikes following storm events.\u201d Nearly all of France has seen 120 to 200% of normal rainfall over the past three months, with numerous episodes of flooding across portions of the country, especially the north, according to M\u00e9t\u00e9o France. The highest E. Coli levels recorded by Fluidion were 23590 MPN/100mL on May 2 and 13090 MPN/100mL on May 30, according to Angelescu. The May 2 result is more than 20 times higher than World Triathlon\u2019s \u201cgood quality\u201d level, according to CNN\u2019s calculation. More recently, following several days of dry and sunny weather, E. Coli levels on Monday 6 June were 2280 MPN/100mL, according to Angelescu, better than previous results but still above acceptable levels for swimming. If E. Coli levels remain this high, the swimming leg of the triathlon will have to be cancelled, according to World Triathlon competition rules, unless the organization\u2019s medical committee decides that the race can go ahead. Does Paris 2024 have a plan B? Earlier in June, World Triathlon told CNN in an email that the first contingency plan would be to delay the race by one day. But if poor water quality persisted, the triathlon would have to be downgraded to a duathlon with no swimming, the organization confirmed. Angelescu said that while E. Coli is not typically pathogenic itself, it can indicate the presence of other pathogens, which can cause skin rashes, diarrhea, serious gastrointestinal diseases and, in very rare cases, even death. However, Angelescu said that the water quality of the Seine is likely to improve significantly before July due to drier and sunnier summer conditions, which will reduce the frequency of sewage spills. \u201cIt is highly speculative and scientifically unsound to project any conclusions about water quality during the Games based on recent trends,\u201d he said. Angelescu said that \u201csignificant infrastructure projects\u201d by the city of Paris designed to improve water quality will have a \u201csubstantial\u201d impact. \u201cThese tanks are expected to become operational before the Games, potentially becoming a \u2026 Games changer,\u201d added Angelescu. \u201cWhen our instruments and data indicate that the water quality is good, we will be the first to dive in, headfirst!\u201d Angelescu\u2019s tone of optimism isn\u2019t universally shared. French charity Surfrider Foundation Europe warned in April that they were \u201cgenuinely concerned about the health of athletes\u201d after only one of the 14 samples collected by the organization indicated a satisfactory standard of water quality for swimming. Two months later, the charity told CNN that they have since taken five additional samples, with E. coli levels remaining \u201csystematically above the guide values.\u201d CNN has not independently verified the charity\u2019s findings. How has Paris 2024 responded to these findings? Paris 2024 said they still have \u201cgreat confidence\u201d in the city of Paris to improve water quality to the \u201cnecessary standard\u201d in time for the Games. \u201cGenerally, water quality in the Seine continues to improve every day,\u201d they said in a statement to CNN in early June. \u201cBy the time of the Games, bacteriological pollution in the Seine will have been reduced by 75% thanks to the range of actions undertaken by our partners.\u201d In a statement to CNN, the city of Paris said that recent grey and rainy conditions have had a \u201cmajor impact\u201d on the Seine\u2019s water quality. A lack of sunlight \u2013 which would normally help to kill bacteria \u2013 has also contributed to the poor quality, they said earlier this month. They added: \u201cIt is only when summer conditions (strong sunshine, high temperatures, prolonged absence of rain) become established that the Seine will gradually return to its \u2018summer\u2019 appearance, and that we will see a gradual and significant improvement in water quality.\u201d Following multiple days of sunny weather in the first week of June,\u00a0E. Coli\u00a0levels improved near Pont Alexandre III Bridge, according to official data from the city of Paris shared with CNN, but whether the good weather will last remains to be seen. No precipitation trend, higher or lower than average, has been\u00a0predicted\u00a0for areas around Paris for the summer. Since June 1,\u00a0E. Coli\u00a0levels declined from around 7000 UFC/100mL (equivalent units to MPN/100mL, according to World Triathlon) to just below 1000 UFC/100mL on June 9, according to official data. However, World Triathlon\u2019s\u00a0Competition Rules\u00a02024 say that these levels are still too high for swimming, unless the organization\u2019s medical committee decides that the race can go ahead. Disinfectant and probiotics The threat that E. Coli and other bacteria pose is nothing new to triathlon teams. Over the last decade, water quality issues have been increasingly encountered, according to Mike Cavendish, Director of Performance at British Triathlon, who outlined preventative measures British athletes will be taking to ensure their health during Paris 2024. \u201cDisinfectant sounds like a really basic thing but it\u2019s something we will be doing a lot of, making sure that athletes are clean, that their equipment is clean,\u201d Cavendish told CNN in a telephone interview. Probiotic yogurts can also help to improve gut health, Cavenish added. Phil Dunne, Triathlon Canada\u2019s High Performance Director, said in a statement to CNN that their athletes are being supported by \u201ca team of physicians and dietitians\u201d to reduce the risk of becoming sick due to \u201ccompromised\u201d water quality. Tim Harradine, CEO of AusTriathlon, said that triathletes are used to dealing with the \u201cchanging nature\u201d of waterways. \u201cSometimes they race in the rain, sometimes they race in the heat,\u201d Harradine told CNN in a telephone interview, adding that athlete health will always come first. Lehair, who recently changed her nationality in time to represent Luxembourg at Paris 2024, told CNN that she understands why precautions need to be taken, but didn\u2019t seem altogether convinced by the effectiveness of measures like probiotics. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be good for the body anyway, so maybe you can have a try but it\u2019s not 100% sure that you won\u2019t get sick if you take probiotics,\u201d she said. \u201cAt least maybe you are stressing a bit less on the day of the race.\u201d \u2018Better quality of water is good for everyone\u2019 Paris 2024 isn\u2019t the first sporting event to contend with water quality issues. In March, concerns were raised after E. coli bacteria was discovered in London\u2019s River Thames ahead of the historic Oxford and Cambridge boat race. Also, in 2016, drug-resistant superbugs from hospital sewage were found in Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Guanabara Bay. Lehair is pleased that the authorities are attempting to clean up the river, but just wishes it had happened sooner. \u201cThey should have done this much before, just for the quality of the water in general and for the people, for the city,\u201d she said. \u201cBetter quality of water is good for everyone.\u201d Cavendish said that if the authorities\u2019 clean-up efforts in Paris prove successful, other countries could be encouraged to follow suit. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIf they pull this off and it looks fantastic, and they get a swim for the Olympics and the Paralympics \u2026 it puts pressure on other governments around the world, including our own, to try and make sure that we get safe swimming,\u201d said Cavendish. Harradine echoed that sentiment: \u201cIt\u2019s a very visible race venue and what a great legacy it could leave if this works well for the city.\u201d And if the worst comes to the worst and the impact of rain on water quality does threaten the triathlon races Cavendish is confident that the right call will be made. \u201cThe eyes of the world are on this race so I think you can guarantee that they (Paris 2024 and World Triathlon) will be putting all the right people in the room to make the right decision,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_04_26_sport_aya-nakamura-france-culture-wars-paris-2024-spt-intl", "text": "Aya Nakamura was born in the former French colony of Mali, raised in France and is\u00a0widely considered\u00a0the most streamed female Francophone artist in the world. The 28-year-old,\u00a0as well as being Malian,\u00a0is a French citizen, and a multiple-platinum-selling pop star who was brought up in the Parisian suburbs. However,\u00a0ahead of Paris 2024, Nakamura finds herself at the\u00a0center\u00a0of France\u2019s culture wars. Amid widespread\u00a0rumors\u00a0the singer would\u00a0perform at the Games\u2019 Opening Ceremony, singing an Edith Piaf song,\u00a0some members of France\u2019s far-right have questioned\u00a0whether she embodies French heritage, values and identity.\u00a0Piaf is a key figure in France\u2019s musical \u2013 and national \u2013 identity. \u201cThere\u2019s no way Aya. This is Paris, not the market\u00a0in\u00a0Bamako,\u201d said fringe\u00a0and extreme\u00a0far-right group Les Natifs (Natives) on X, formerly known\u00a0as Twitter, in March, referring to Mali\u2019s capital. Nakamura has defended herself on social media, saying on X: \u201cI\u2019m becoming the number one state subject in debates\u00a0\u2026but what do I really owe you all? Nothing.\u201d The singer has received support from Rachida Dati, France\u2019s Minister of Culture, who spoke out in defence of Nakamura, saying \u201cbe careful of the pretext of attacking someone out of pure racism.\u201d Paris 2024\u2019s organizing committee told CNN: \u201cWe were very shocked by the racist attacks against Aya Nakamura in recent days. We offer our full support to the most listened-to French artist in the world.\u201d Whether Nakamura will perform at the Olympics\u2019 opening ceremony is still unconfirmed, with the Paris 2024 organizing committee telling CNN that they\u00a0\u201cwon\u2019t be confirming or denying\u201d\u00a0any rumors or reports, to \u201cleave room for surprises\u201d on the day. CNN has reached out to Nakamura but she declined to\u00a0be interviewed\u00a0on the matter. \u2018She contributes to French culture\u2019 However, many others in France are all too keen to comment on this cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. Far-right politician Marion Mar\u00e9chal,\u00a0who is the niece\u00a0of far-right National Rally party leader\u00a0Marine Le Pen and a member of the\u00a0Reconqu\u00eate\u00a0party, told French\u00a0television stations BMFTV and Europe 1\u00a0that Nakamura\u00a0\u201cdoes not sing in French,\u201d referencing the blend of Parisian and African\u00a0derived slang\u00a0that often feature in her lyrics. \u201cI think that the people who criticize her actually don\u2019t accept that she embodies France,\u201d\u00a0French activist Rokhaya Diallo told CNN. \u201cThe\u00a0slang she uses is used by young people and a lot of young French people use slang.\u201d Nakamura often uses a mix of verlan and African derived slang from languages such as Bambara, from her birth country Mali,\u00a0in her music. Her number one hit song\u00a0\u201cDjadja,\u201d\u00a0contains the lyric \u201cle monde est tit-pe\u201d \u2013 the world is small \u2013 with word \u2018tit-pe\u2019 inverting the French word \u2018petit.\u2019 Verlan, a type of French slang named after\u00a0the inversion of the French word \u2018l\u2019envers\u2019 \u2013 meaning backwards \u2013 originates from the outskirts of Paris known as \u2018la cit\u00e9\u2019 (the suburbs)\u00a0that have had\u00a0large\u00a0immigrant population. At the inauguration of the\u00a0Olympic Aquatics Centre\u00a0earlier this month, French President Emanuel Macron\u00a0said that Nakamura \u201cspeaks to a good number of our compatriots\u201d and claimed that \u201cthese\u00a0games and ceremonies should reflect us, and she contributes to French culture, to French music.\u201d \u201cI want to defend here these choices and defend the fact that there must be artistic freedom and that politics should not interfere,\u201d added Macron. In an interview with France Inter,\u00a0Macron\u2019s political rival Le Pen, known for her right-wing views, claimed that the President was seeking to \u201coutrage\u201d and \u201chumiliate the French people\u201d when asked whether she thinks Nakamura opening the games would be a\u00a0good symbol. When asked to further explain why this choice would be a humiliation, Le Pen responded \u201cshe does not sing in French, or a foreign language, she sings nonsense.\u201d Speaking to CNN, Professor of Political Science at the University of Nice,\u00a0Vincent\u00a0Martigny, said that\u00a0while\u00a0there are those who believe it is right to promote minorities and their role in French culture, there are others, who hold more traditional views, which he terms as racist in relation to the country\u2019s colonial past. 1998 World Cup There have been moments of\u00a0perceived\u00a0unity in France\u2019s past, notably when the men\u2019s national soccer team won the 1998 World Cup. That triumph helped popularise the slogan \u201cBlack, Blanc, Beur\u201d \u2013 Black, White, Arab\u00a0\u00a0\u2013\u00a0amid a push for unity and inclusion. Beur\u2019 is verlan for the French word \u2018arabe.\u2019 France\u2019s World Cup winning team of 1998\u00a0was made up of a\u00a0diverse\u00a0group\u00a0of players,\u00a0not only of European descent but also from the ex-colonies of France\u00a0and other countries.\u00a0Many thought\u00a0at the time\u00a0that the 1998 team was a sign of a truly integrated, multi-cultural France. But notable social and cultural divisions have emerged in France in recent years. There have been\u00a0multiple bans and restrictions against Islamic dress. The nationwide ban on\u00a0public\u00a0schoolchildren wearing abayas,\u00a0was\u00a0denounced as an \u201cIslamophobic campaign\u201d by\u00a0one\u00a0politician\u00a0on the left.\u00a0Athletes have been banned\u00a0from wearing a hijab while competing representing France\u00a0at the Paris\u00a0Olympic Games. Then there have been multiple protests and riots over police brutality leading to the death of\u00a0some French inhabitants of North and West African heritage\u00a0from the suburbs of Paris, fueling backlash over policing methods in marginalized communities. Nakamura\u2019s\u00a0birth\u00a0country\u00a0of Mali is one of the many\u00a0former\u00a0French colonies. There are millions of French citizens, like Nakamura, who are either themselves immigrants or descendants of immigrants from\u00a0nations formerly colonized by France. These days France\u00a0finds itself embroiled in a very public debate over the recognition and acceptance of its immigrants as the country continues to reckon with its colonial history. Professor Martigny believes that the\u00a0nationalist\u00a0party is \u201cstronger than ever\u201d and that nationalists in France are \u201cmore nationalist\u201d and more open with their views today than they were in the past. Activist Diallo also believes that France is struggling to see itself \u201cas it is\u201d and recognize non-White individuals as fully French. \u201cDespite her successes, despite her undeniable achievements, we still think that it\u2019s not an honor for us to have such a woman represent us,\u201d Diallo told CNN, referring to Nakamura. \u2018The Great Replacement\u2019 theory Political scientist Oliver Roy, who is Professor\u00a0at the EUI School of Transnational Governance, told CNN that a common belief that could be fuelling the culture wars in France is an ideology\u00a0expressed\u00a0\u201cnot just [by] the extreme right, but also part of the traditional centre right\u201d known as \u201cthe great replacement.\u201d He describes\u00a0the term\u00a0as \u201cthe idea that there is a new population coming from the south, which is replacing the old traditional, French population.\u201d However, he maintains that this fear \u201cis not supported by demography, [or] by statistics, and is, of course, very ideological.\u201d According to Martigny, France\u2019s cultural divisions are amplified on social media by both extremes of the political spectrum. \u201cBecause of the social networks, public debates are more violent on these issues than they used to be,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a theatre for the expression of extremely strong minded, sometimes racist, very often offensive comments on Twitter, on X, and on other social networks,\u201d added Martigny. \u201cYou have a lot of X accounts who are really, really, really pro far-right. And so they played a role in discussing these issues and making it a controversy. And then this controversy is exported to the traditional media.\u201d \u2018Show a very optimistic face for France\u2019 As Nakamura was targeted by fringe and extreme far-right groups as well as far-right politicians, in an interview\u00a0with BMFTV and RMC,\u00a0Macron said that \u201cthe reactions shocked me \u2026 there\u00a0were\u00a0truly racist reactions.\u201d However,\u00a0Martigny says he sees\u00a0Macron\u2019s condemnation of the attacks as racist as an attempt to balance the scales after the passing of\u00a0what the professor called\u00a0a \u201cvery restrictive law on immigration\u201d a few months ago. In December, Macron passed a controversial bill calling for tougher immigration that was endorsed by the far-right, and rejected by many in his own camp. Politicians such as Le Pen hailed the legislation as an \u201cideological victory\u201d whilst French health Minister, Aurelien Rousseau resigned in protest.\u00a0It included many amendments tightening immigration laws, one of which dictated children born to foreign parents on French soil would no longer become automatic French citizens but would have to apply for citizenship. \u201cHe needs to make that forgotten in a certain way by showing that he has a sense of balance on these issues,\u201d\u00a0Martigny states. By promoting Nakamura, Martigny believes that Macron\u2019s ambitions may have been to \u201cshow a very optimistic face for France.\u201d \u201c[There are] very strong cultural wars in France revolving around pop stars, and the type of pop stars that you can mobilize or the type of artists that you can mobilize when you want to unite the country.\u201d With less than 100 days to go until the Olympics, many hope Paris 2024 will give France the opportunity to show unity. However, the heated reactions to Nakamura hints at a more pessimistic outlook.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/26/sport/aya-nakamura-france-culture-wars-paris-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_sport_bryson-dechambeau-us-open-win-2024-spt-intl", "text": "American Bryson DeChambeau won his second US Open title on Sunday, edging Rory McIlroy in a nerve-shredding finale at Pinehurst No. 2 in Pinehurst, North Carolina. LIV Golf star DeChambeau carded a final round one-over 71 to finish one stroke ahead of his Northern Irish counterpart at six-under overall and add to his first major victory in 2020. It resigned world No. 3 McIlroy to yet another heartbreaking near-miss as his 10-year wait for a fifth major title continues. The 35-year-old played brilliantly to surge from three shots behind to two ahead of DeChambeau, only to miss two putts from inside four feet across the last two holes. Left needing to close with par to win, DeChambeau held his nerve to triumph and exorcise the demons of falling one stroke short of the PGA Championship to compatriot Xander Schauffele last month. With his victory falling on Father\u2019s Day, an emotional DeChambeau began his winner\u2019s speech by dedicating the trophy to his father Jon, who died in 2022. \u201cFirst off I want to say a Happy Father\u2019s Day to every father out there,\u201d DeChambeau said.\u201cThis one is for him.\u201d It makes the 30-year-old the second golfer after last year\u2019s PGA Championship winner Brooks Koepka to win a major after departing the PGA Tour for LIV Golf. Cameron Smith and Jon Rahm joined the Saudi-backed circuit after their victories at the 2022 Open Championship and 2023 Masters respectively. Once maligned by some fans, DeChambeau \u2013 whose personal YouTube channel continues to amass subscribers \u2013 has become a crowd-favorite at the majors this year and further consolidated that reputation at Pinehurst. The California-born golfer mixed thrilling play with regular fan interaction throughout, wooing fans one final time by delivering on his victor\u2019s speech promise to let them touch the trophy and ferrying it around the throngs gathered at the 18th green. \u201cI just can\u2019t thank you guys enough for all the support this week,\u201d he added to the crowd. \u201cYou guys have meant the world to me. You are the best fans in the world and I can\u2019t thank you enough.\u201d The joyous scenes served as a stark contrast to the agony undoubtedly felt by McIlroy, who declined to speak to media after his final round one-under 69. McIlroy has plugged away at ending his major drought with remarkable consistency since his last triumph at the 2014 Open Championship, finishing inside the top-10 on 20 of his 36 subsequent appearances at the four flagship events, including his last five in a row at the US Open. He has been a major runner-up three times before, his most recent to Wyndham Clark at last year\u2019s tournament, but the fourth has the potential to haunt him the most given the context. Three bogeys and a par across his last four holes, compounded by two horror close-range misses, resigned him to a closing 69. Even one stroke better would ultimately have been enough to force DeChambeau into a playoff. McIlroy had made his previous 496 putts from inside three feet before his miss for par at the 16th, according to the PGA Tour. The curtain falls on the 2024 men\u2019s major calendar with the 152nd Open Championship at Royal Troon in Scotland on July 18, where American Brian Harman will seek to defend the Claret Jug. Scheffler endures rare torrid week Scottie Scheffler\u2019s miserable week ended in another birdie-less round as the world No.1 toiled to a tied-41st finish at eight-over par overall, his worst major performance in two years. Five wins in his previous eight starts \u2013 including last week\u2019s Memorial Tournament \u2013 had seen Scheffler arrive at Pinehurst as the overwhelming favorite yet he struggled to cope with the course\u2019s firm and fast greens, the typically unflappable Texan\u2019s frustrations bubbling over as he narrowly scraped under the cut line Friday. A third round one-over 71 meant Scheffler had shot four consecutive rounds over par for the first time in a professional career spanning 120 PGA Tour events, and the unwanted streak extended to five as he signed off with a 72. April\u2019s Masters champion had gone 168 rounds with at least one birdie before his second round 74, and had not finished outside the top-25 at a major since missing the cut at the 2022 PGA Championship. Both streaks had extended through a tied-eighth finish at last month\u2019s PGA Championship, a result achieved despite his arrest and release from jail during the major. \u201cI couldn\u2019t hole anything. I could not see the break on these greens,\u201d Scheffler, who has since seen all charges against him dismissed, told reporters Sunday. \u201cThe greens this week kind of had my number. I felt like I hit a lot of really good putts that did weird things at the cup that I was not expecting them to do.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been on a good stretch of golf,\u201d he added. \u201cHad one tough event following a great event. I\u2019m not really going to look too much into it but focus more on my prep.\u201d Scheffler finished 12 shots behind his compatriots Tony Finau and Patrick Cantlay, who shared third place at four-under overall, one shot behind McIlroy. France\u2019s Matthieu Pavon finished a further stroke back. Unfamiliar territory A virtuoso third round 67 that was as entertaining as it was excellent had rocketed DeChambeau into the final 18 holes with a plush \u2013 yet unfamiliar \u2013 three shot cushion. The Californian had never before held the 54-hole lead at a major championship. Though he had ultimately cantered to victory at Winged Foot six years ago, he had trailed Matthew Wolff by two strokes ahead of the final round before tearing away from his compatriot down the stretch. DeChambeau said Saturday he was aiming to play \u201cboring golf\u201d to get over the line, and looked to be delivering on his plan as he made a steady \u2013 albeit unspectacular \u2013 start with six pars and a bogey through the opening seven holes. Yet that strategy, and his nerve, soon came under enormous scrutiny. Unlike Wolff four years ago, McIlroy was showing no signs of fading. Far from it \u2013 he was catching fire. The steely-eyed Northern Irishman was making a mockery of the firm and fast greens that had humbled so much of the field across the week. After two birdies from beyond 20 feet, McIlroy lasered in his fourth in a five-hole stretch at the 13th. With DeChambeau bogeying the 12th, McIlroy headed to the next tee box with a two stroke cushion. The picture had changed entirely in less than 20 minutes, yet it took the same amount of time for it to reset as DeChambeau capitalized on a bogey from his rival to draw level just two holes later. It set up a climax that would serve as the ultimate test of nerve and DeChambeau blinked first, a birdie opportunity turning into a bogey as his four-foot par putt lipped out of the 15th cup. Incredibly though, McIlroy would mirror the error from even closer range mere moments later to surrender his lead and set in motion a meltdown to rival his infamous collapse at the Masters in 2011. Yet the minor consolation of that spiral at Augusta National was that victory had all but vanished shortly after he made the turn. This time, the nightmare ran on till to the last two-and-a-half feet, as a simple conversion for par at the 18th green would have forced DeChambeau to birdie to avoid a playoff. There was a glimmer of hope as DeChambeau went from a hook into the native area to a bunker, but the American recovered superbly with a stunning 55-yard approach to within four feet of the cup. Watching anxiously on a clubhouse TV, McIlroy could only watch as DeChambeau safely avoided making the same mistake he did.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/sport/bryson-dechambeau-us-open-win-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_sport_bryson-dechambeau-reinvention-dad-us-open-2024-spt-intl", "text": "As Bryson DeChambeau walks off the 10th green at Pinehurst during Sunday\u2019s final round of the US Open, the golfer does what he\u2019s been doing all week; making time to acknowledge fans lining the course. The 30-year-old US golfer might be holding a one-shot lead atop the leaderboard at the US Open, but he gives a spectator a ball and signs his hat before high-fiving a row of on-lookers. DeChambeau looks to be a different man from a few years ago. There was a widely-held perception that the golfer was a highly-strung, uber-competitor, whose desire to win often grated on his rivals. Fast forward to 2024 and DeChambeau looks a lot more comfortable in his skin. That change has seemingly paid huge dividends, with the 30-year-old claiming his second major title over the weekend, winning the US Open at Pinehurst in North Carolina. He did so in spectacular fashion as he held off Rory McIlroy\u2019s challenge and hit a crucial bunker shot on the final hole to leave him a simple putt to clinch the title. DeChambeau called his bunker effort \u201cpossibly my best golf shot of my entire life.\u201d DeChambeau 2:0 is the result of a \u201clot of personal growth,\u201d according to the golfer. \u201c2022 was a rock-bottom year for me and pushed me to be the person I am today. I\u2019ve got a lot of people that have stuck around me from 2022 which has allowed me to be the person I\u2019ve grown to be now and I can\u2019t thank them enough because without them, I wouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d DeChambeau told CNN\u2019s Patrick Snell. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long road but I\u2019m certainly very blessed and thankful to have those individuals sticking with me and continuing to push me forward.\u201d That low point in his life in 2022 coincided with his controversial move to the Saudi-backed LIV Golf as well as his injury struggles. A loss of form resulted in DeChambeau tumble down the world rankings as he struggled with his game to leave him a \u201cpretty deep hole.\u201d \u201cGolf swing wasn\u2019t doing well. Ball striking was terrible. Putting wasn\u2019t great,\u201d he remembers. But, through the help and support of the people around him and hard work on the course, DeChambeau\u2019s 2024 has something of a annus mirabilis. Before appearing at Pinehurst, he had engineered successful appearances at this year\u2019s majors, finishing tied-sixth at The Masters and second at the PGA Championship. The best was still to come though, as DeChambeau showed grit and resilience to claim his second US Open title, all the while showing his appreciation for the support he got over the four days in North Carolina. \u201cMy mission is to continue to expand the game, grow the game globally, domestically. YouTube has really helped me accomplish some of that,\u201d DeChambeau told reporters afterwards. \u201cConsequently I think people have seen who I am on YouTube, which has been fantastic, \u2018cause then I get to play off of it. It just feeds itself out here. \u201cThey just say things that make me interact and engage. When is the next junior club set coming out? \u201cIt\u2019s direct conversations to people that truly engage with what I\u2019m doing.

On Tuesday, the 29-year-old hit a leadoff home run in the team\u2019s 4-3 victory over the Chicago White Sox to become the first Dodger since Roy Campanella in 1955 to have nine straight games with a run batted in (RBI). His trip around the bases wasn\u2019t the smoothest of his career, however. When Ohtani was midway between first and second base, the Japanese superstar ran back to first base to touch it again because he wasn\u2019t sure if he had done so on his initial way around. He said afterwards it was \u201cjust to be safe.\u201d He also carried his bat with him well past first base \u2013 something out of the ordinary in baseball. \u201cI was just kind of looking at the ball, hoping that it was gonna go out,\u201d Ohtani said through interpreter Will Ireton, per the MLB. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize I had the bat with me, so I dropped it. That\u2019s where (first-base coach) Clayton (McCullough) came in. And so that\u2019s why I dropped the bat and just wasn\u2019t quite sure if I stepped on the bag.\u201d His nine consecutive games with an RBI ties the Dodgers franchise record with Campanella, Augie Galan and Eddie Brown, who also reached the mark in 1944 and 1924 respectively. Ohtani would later add an RBI single in the fourth inning, going 2-for-4 with two runs total in the game, as the Dodgers won their 50th of the season. \u201cI don\u2019t know what more we can really say about him,\u201d Dodgers first baseman Freddie Freeman said of Ohtani, per the MLB. \u201cI think we\u2019ve said everything we can since he\u2019s entered this league about what an amazing player he is. \u201cSometimes, you\u2019ve just got to step back and just appreciate a player like this.\u201d Ohtani\u2019s excellent debut season with the Dodgers really kicked into gear in June, as he\u2019s averaged .306 batting with 10 home runs, 22 RBIs and 15 walks compared to 20 strikeouts in 22 games. As a result, he\u2019s already the favorite to win NL MVP midway through his first season with the franchise. Ohtani\u2019s output as a batter has improved in the absence of having to display his two-way skills. He is serving as a designated hitter in 2024 after undergoing elbow surgery and will not pitch until 2025.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/sport/shohei-ohtani-la-dodgers-rbi-record-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}

I didn\u2019t realize, but my mom told me before the match that it was my 1,000th match on tour, so a lot of matches, a lot of wear and tear on the body and it\u2019s not easy, but I managed to push through it. \u201cObviously, during the match, it\u2019s difficult, but great reward at the end for the hard work and effort I put into the match. \u201cI\u2019ve not got too many wins this year.

World No. 3 Aryna Sabalenka told reporters in Berlin at the Ecotrans Ladies Open she was skipping the Olympics, citing WTA tournament participation\u00a0requirements\u00a0and her health. The Belarusian had struggled with a stomach illness during her French Open quarterfinal loss to Mirra Andreeva on June 5, her first defeat before the semifinals of a major since 2022. Tennis at this year\u2019s Olympics will take place on the clay at Roland Garros. \u201cEspecially with all the struggles I was having last month, I feel like I need to take care of my health. \u2026 It\u2019s too much with the scheduling,\u201d Sabalenka said. \u201cIt\u2019s just too much. I made the decision to take care of my health.\u201d Had Sabalenka elected to compete at the Games, she would have been entered as an Individual Neutral Athlete, provided she passed an eligibility review. Belarusian and Russian athletes are prohibited from competing under their nations\u2019 flags due to the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The two-time grand slam champion is the No. 2 seed in the Berlin grass-court tournament this week as she prepares for Wimbledon. This will be her first tournament since the French Open. World No. 10 and three-time grand slam finalist Ons Jabeur also confirmed that she will miss the Games next month, writing on social media that the change of surfaces would put her health at risk. The Tunisian has been dealing with a recurring knee injury. After the clay court season concluded at the French Open, players will now spend the next few weeks playing on grass, a much faster and often slippery surface. The WTA grass court season ends at Wimbledon, with the majority of tournaments throughout rest of the calendar typically being staged on hard courts. However, with the Olympics being held at Roland-Garros, a switch back to the physically taxing clay offers a challenge. \u201cAfter consulting with my medical team regarding attending the Olympics in Paris, we have decided that the quick change of surface and the body\u2019s adaptation required would put my knee at risk and jeopardize the rest of my season,\u201d Jabeur posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. \u201cUnfortunately, I will not be able to participate in the 2024 Paris Olympics. \u201cI have always loved representing my country in any competition, However, I must listen to my body and follow my medical team\u2019s advise.\u201d Sabalenka and Jabeur join Great Britain\u2019s Emma Raducanu in opting not to compete at the Olympics. As a former grand slam winner, Raducanu was offered a wild card spot in the tournament, which would have given her automatic entry into the Games despite her current ranking of No. 165. However, she turned it down saying it wasn\u2019t the \u201cright time\u201d for her this year. \u201cWith the changing surface, it\u2019s just not worth the risk for me at this point,\u201d Raducanu said. Raducanu had dropped out of French Open qualifying to work on building her fitness. Choosing to focus on the grass-court and hard-court portions of the season seemed to pay off, as Raducanu reached the semifinals at the Rothesay Open, a Wimbledon tune-up event, last week.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/sport/aryna-sabalenka-ons-jabeur-miss-olympics-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}

After winning the semifinal earlier in the day, Lyles tied his personal best of 9.83 seconds to cross the line first in the final and punch his ticket to France. He was followed by Kenny Bednarek in second with a time 9.87 seconds (a personal best), while Fred Kerley was third with a season\u2019s best 9.88. Both sprinters \u2013 who won a silver medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics in the 100m and 200m respectively \u2013 also qualified for Paris. Lyles \u2013 the reigning 100m, 200m and 4 x 100m relay world champion \u2013 missed out on the 100m in Tokyo after finishing seventh at the trials.

His confidence carried through to the finish line, raising his finger to the sky in celebration before the race had concluded. Lyles was made to work for his victory, though \u2013 2019 world champion Christian Coleman exploded out of the blocks to take an early lead, but began to fade around the halfway point and eventually finished in fourth place, 0.05 seconds behind Kerley.

{"id": "2024_06_11_sport_north-korea-soccer-team-inside-spt-intl", "text": "What happens within North Korea\u2019s soccer team has been kept a closely guarded secret since its creation at the end of World War II. Millions around the world caught a glimpse of the North Korean men\u2019s team in two World Cups. The Cheollima \u2013 a mythical winged horse found in East Asian mythology and featured prominently in North Korean society \u2013 beat Italy 1-0 in a stunning performance in Middlesbrough, England, in 1966. However, the team\u2019s appearance at the 2010 tournament in South Africa was far less successful, as the team lost all three of its matches, including a 7-0 shellacking by Portugal. But much like the reclusive nation itself, the team in recent years has fallen back into the shadows. Now in an exclusive interview with CNN Sport, retired North Korean midfielder An Yong Hak, who lives in Japan, has revealed what it\u2019s like to play for the team. The secrecy surrounding the North Korean national team was also evident in the case of star player Han Kwang Song. At his peak, Han was on the roster of Italian giant Juventus and featured in its U-23 side, but then he vanished from the public eye for more than three years. He had been last spotted lifting a trophy with his most recent team, Qatari club Al-Duhail, in 2020 as UN Security Council resolutions later forced the repatriation of all North Korean workers abroad. But that rapid change of fortune \u2013 from playing in top divisions in Italy and Qatar to being stuck at an embassy for the better part of three years \u2013 did not cause the striker to consider quitting soccer. Almost out of nowhere, Han publicly reappeared last November with North Korea for its World Cup qualifiers, scoring a header in a 6-1 drubbing of Myanmar. Retired North Korean midfielder An, who is now 45, laments Han being stuck in diplomatic limbo, saying it was unfortunate that the striker was unable to join Pyongyang\u2019s leading domestic club team \u2013 4.25 SC, or April 25 SC \u2013 sooner \u201cto develop at an age when he could have advanced more.\u201d \u201cHe was stuck in an embassy in China, and he had to train alone for about two to three years. Last September, I think, they let him into the country,\u201d An told CNN Sport, citing a North Korean official he spoke with. Han stayed in the embassy while the North Korean borders were shut due to the Covid-19 pandemic, An added. Born in Japan with a North Korean passport, An represented North Korea on the pitch for 10 years, a national team career which Han told An he enjoyed witnessing, according to the retired international midfielder. An recalled meeting Han for the first time in 2019 in Pyongyang, where he watched the former Cagliari striker play against South Korea, captained by Tottenham Hotspur star Son Heung-min, in a qualifier for the 2022 Qatar World Cup. After that match, An said he was waiting to fly back home to Japan and coincidentally ran into Han and two other North Korean players \u2013 Pak Kwang Ryong and Choe Song Hyok \u2013 who were playing in Austria and Italy respectively at the time. \u201c[Han] told me that he had been watching me at the stadium when I played on the national team,\u201d An said of his first interaction with the striker. An recalled telling Han and the young North Korea players, \u201cYou guys have to do well from now on, and I\u2019ll also go to Italy to cheer you guys on.\u2019\u201d \u201cYes, please come! I\u2019ll come pick you up,\u201d Han replied to An. Then in March this year \u2013 five years and one pandemic later \u2013 the two met again, this time in Tokyo, Japan. \u201cI went to the hotel [the team was staying at] a day after the game, and I told him, \u2018It\u2019s been a long time,\u2019\u201d An said. The pair talked about the previous day\u2019s 2026 World Cup qualifying match where North Korea had lost to Japan by one goal. \u201cHan\u2019s shot had hit the post and it didn\u2019t go in, so we talked about how close he was [to scoring],\u201d said An. \u201cBecause of the sanctions, Han said, \u2018I\u2019m playing in [North Korea],\u2019\u201d said An, adding that there was not much time to get into deeper conversation. He referred to Han as \u201cthe kind of talent that comes around every 10 or 20 years\u201d and as someone who had the potential to become \u201ca world-class player.\u201d \u201cI want him to be a symbol of the DPRK [North Korea] national team\u2026 I would like to see him become a player like Son Heung-min or someone of that caliber,\u201d An said of the 25-year-old Han. \u2018A hoax\u2019 Although North Korea has long isolated itself from the rest of the world, it has frequently participated in international sporting competitions, with the notable exception of during the Covid-19 pandemic. When the Cheollima ended its 2010 World Cup run \u2013 losing every group stage match, against Brazil, Portugal and Ivory Coast \u2013 rumors and reports arose that the players and coaches were subjected to punishments back in Pyongyang. Citing anonymous sources, Radio Free Asia reported that coach Kim Jong Hun was sent to do forced labor, while the players were subjected to \u201charsh ideological criticism,\u201d except An and another North Korean-Japanese striker, Jong Tae Se. CNN could not independently verify this report. An called such reports \u201ca hoax.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard to get information about DPRK, so there are still stories about people being sent to a coal mine after losing a match or being lectured for six hours, but there are no such stories at all, as far as I know,\u201d An said, denying rumors about the isolated country, citing his 10-year career of playing for the national team. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to put an end to that kind of false information,\u201d he said. Earning a spot at the 2010 World Cup marked only the second time North Korea had qualified for the world\u2019s marquee soccer competition since 1966, when the Cheollima made it to the quarterfinals, losing to Portugal 5-3. When North Korea secured its ticket to South Africa, the squad\u2019s players were acknowledged by the regime with a certificate and an apartment in Pyongyang, a rare but well-known practice by the Kim regime to reward loyalty, according to state media KCNA and verified by An. \u201cEveryone received a certificate, and we each received an apartment in Pyongyang,\u201d An said, adding that he did not get one because he is \u201cZainichi Korean.\u201d Koreans who migrated or were forced to move to Japan under colonial rule before the peninsula was divided in half are known in Japanese as \u201cZainichi Korean,\u201d including their descendants. They are eligible to apply for a North Korean passport or acquire South Korean nationality as they are not given Japanese citizenship \u2013 they are, however, legal residents in Japan and can gain citizenship through naturalization. A third generation Zainichi Korean, An holds his North Korean nationality with pride. \u201cMy grandparents kept their DPRK identity, although they could have chosen to live an easy life, so I didn\u2019t want to easily change that identity of mine,\u201d An explained, adding that he also considered South Korea his geographical home. Another Zainichi Korean on the 2010 squad was Jong Tae Se, who grabbed the world\u2019s attention as he broke down in tears during North Korea\u2019s national anthem ahead of the squad\u2019s 2-1 loss to Brazil. Jong\u2019s tears moved the fans and even An said, \u201cMany Zainichi Koreans were extremely moved by it.\u201d \u201cThis Zainichi Korean, born and raised in Japan, had a big dream and made it come true. I was able to stand side-by-side with the athletes from my home country and sing the national anthem,\u201d said An. Earning respect When An joined the North Korean national team upon receiving a call-up letter in 2002, he remembers not being immediately accepted by teammates. \u201cThe players, coaches and managers didn\u2019t know us very well. We needed to be accepted. We weren\u2019t exactly welcomed from the beginning,\u201d the retired midfielder said. North Korean players have strong bonds, as the majority of them \u2013 except for those like Han who used to play abroad and Zainichi Koreans \u2013 reside in the country, and therefore, can be called up for the national team at almost any time, according to An. To be accepted by the squad, newcomer An had to prove himself to the other North Korean players. \u201cI had to compete with the players in daily practice to win their trust and gain recognition. However, practice alone was not enough,\u201d he said. \u201cI scored two goals in a World Cup qualifying match and, by producing a result, I was accepted as a member of the national team,\u201d An said, referring to his brace in a 4-1 win against Thailand in the 2006 World Cup qualifiers. It was then that the team welcomed An wholeheartedly and the squad members became \u201clike a family\u201d to him, he said. \u201cUsually, we\u2019re apart, as I\u2019m in Japan and they are in DPRK\u2026 it is difficult to keep in touch,\u201d he said, reflecting on the unfortunate reality where he cannot even message his friends in Pyongyang. Although, as fate would have it, An met his former teammate and current manager of the North Korean national team, Sin Yong Nam, last March. Sin asked An to visit Pyongyang to share his soccer experience with young, promising talent. \u201cWhen we met again after a long time, I felt nostalgic,\u201d said An as he reflected on meeting his compatriots and former teammates after almost five years. \u201cIf another opportunity arises, I would like to return to Pyongyang and, hopefully, provide some assistance to the national team,\u201d An added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/sport/north-korea-soccer-team-inside-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}

It\u2019s the first time in history that Austria has finished top of its group at the European Championship, while the Netherlands also book their place in the last 16 as one of the four best third-placed teams. Donyell Malen\u2019s own goal gave Austria a deserved lead after just six minutes, only for Cody Gakpo to level the score two minutes into the second half. Romano Schmid\u2019s header restored the lead for Ralf Rangnick\u2019s men just 12 minutes later, but the Oranje bounced back again thanks to Memphis Depay\u2019s brilliant improvised finish. However, Austria was relentless and eventually got what proved to be the winning goal as Marcel Sabitzer broke through the Dutch defense and finished smartly high into the roof of the net just 10 minutes from time. France, meanwhile, took the lead over Poland 10 minutes into the second half thanks to Kylian Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s penalty \u2013 the French superstar\u2019s first ever European Championship goal. Poland was given the chance to equalize with a penalty of its own 10 minutes from time after a video assistant referee (VAR) review, but Robert Lewandowski saw his penalty saved by Mike Maignan. However, VAR intervened again and ruled Maignan had moved off his line, allowing the Bar\u00e7a forward to score at the second attempt. The draw means France enters what is widely considered the more difficult half of the knockout bracket, alongside Spain, Germany and Portugal. Dutch despair The Netherlands were unconvincing in their opening two group games, a late 2-1 win over Poland and a stale 0-0 draw with France. After narrowly losing 1-0 to France in its opener, a much-improved Austria overwhelmed Poland with its high intensity, fast-paced soccer in game two and did so again to the Netherlands in the opening minutes of Tuesday\u2019s match. Austria was rewarded for their bright start with a goal after just five minutes when Netherlands winger Malen turned the ball into his own net as he tried to cut out Marko Arnautovi\u0107\u2019s cross. So dominant had Rangnick\u2019s men been in the opening 20 minutes, that fans started early with chants of \u201cOl\u00e9\u201d every time the team passed the ball. It was proving to be an enjoyable afternoon in the Berlin sun for Austria fans \u2013 less so for Malen. The Dortmund forward squandered a brilliant opportunity to make amends for his own goal but scuffed his effort wide of the post when clean through on goal. Arnautovi\u0107 should have doubled Austria\u2019s lead 10 minutes before half-time when Sabitzer\u2019s cross fortuitously ended up at his feet, but the Inter Milan forward failed to even make contact with the ball. Austria had apparently taken a shellshocked Oranje by surprise with its fast start and was passing the ball around with ease for long periods. Whatever manager Ronald Koeman, who looked frustrated throughout the first period, said to his players at the break had the desired effect. The Netherlands began the second half like a different team entirely and leveled the scoreline just moments after the restart as Gakpo brilliantly finished off a blistering counterattack, cutting onto his right foot and bending the ball into the far corner. But the Dutch delight was short lived \u2013 12 minutes to be exact \u2013 as Schmid got on the end of Florian Grillitsch\u2019s cross with a diving header to restore Austria\u2019s lead. Koeman opted to bring on super-sub Wout Weghorst, who saved the Oranje with a late winner over Poland and also with an equalizer against Argentina in the 2022 World Cup. His presence had an almost immediate impact, heading the ball down to Depay who took the ball brilliantly on his thigh and torso before volleying acrobatically past keeper Patrick Pentz. But again the Dutch traded joy for despair, this time after only five minutes. The entire Dutch defense allowed Austria captain Sabitzer to roam freely into the box and fire the ball over Bart Verbruggen. Following the huge win, Austria\u2019s entire squad and backroom staff lined up arm-in-arm in front of thousands of fans inside the Olympiastadion, sharing the historic moment together. But while the Austrians will be riding high going into the knockout stages, Koeman and his Netherlands team have plenty of questions to answer.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/sport/euro-2024-austria-netherlands-group-d-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}

{"id": "2024_06_24_sport_euro-2024-italy-croatia-spain-albania-spt-intl", "text": "Mattia Zaccagni\u2019s last-minute stunner earned Italy a 1-1 draw and sent the defending champion through to the last-16 of Euro 2024, breaking Croatia\u2019s hearts in the process. Luka Modri\u0107\u2019s goal 10 minutes into the second half after he had just missed a penalty looked like it would be enough to earn the\u00a0Vatreni\u00a0a place in the knockout stages. But Zaccagni had other ideas, latching onto Riccardo Calafiori\u2019s pass in the 98th minute and bending his shot past the outstretched hand of Dominik Livakovi\u0107 and into the top corner. It proved to be the penultimate kick of the match as the referee blew for full-time immediately after the restart, the distraught Croatia players, only seconds earlier on the brink of glory, sinking to the turf. Modri\u0107 cut a forlorn figure on the bench and buried his face in his hands. Spain, meanwhile, beat Albania 1-0 off a tidy first-half Ferr\u00e1n Torres goal from Dani Olmo\u2019s through ball to finish top of Group B with nine points from nine. Late drama Croatia has proven to be a real bogey team for Italy over the years. The\u00a0Azzurri\u00a0hadn\u2019t tasted victory over Monday\u2019s opponent in their previous eight meetings, a run stretching back to November 1994. Italy\u2019s only previous win in this fixture came when the two sides first met back in 1942. A chastening 3-0 defeat to Spain in Croatia\u2019s opening game of Euro 2024 threw up questions about whether this was a tournament too far for an aging team, questions that certainly were not answered in a 2-2 draw with Albania. But Italy has been similarly underwhelming so far in Germany, scraping a 2-1 win over Albania before being utterly outplayed by\u00a0La Roja\u00a0in a game the Italians were likely delighted to see end only 1-0. It was a relatively subdued opening 25 minutes; perhaps nerves and the precariousness of the situation were so far getting the better of the two teams. Luka Su\u010di\u0107 saw an early long-range strike tipped over the bar by Gianluigi Donnarumma \u2013 one of the players of the tournament \u2013 before Italy defender Mateo Retegui had a header blocked behind for a corner kick. But Italy should have been ahead just minutes later when Nicol\u00f2 Barella\u2019s delightful cross found Alessandro Bastoni completely unmarked at the far post, only for a stunning save from Livakovi\u0107 to deny what looked a certain goal. The\u00a0Azzurri\u00a0had shown by far the most intent of the two sides and, though Croatia grew into the half as it wore on, Italy continued to look dangerous as Lorenzo Pellegrini brought another smart save out of Livakovi\u0107 with a low strike from the edge of the area. It was a strangely subdued first half from a Croatia side that will have known that only a point would very likely not be enough to see the team through to the knockout stages. But the half-time substitution of Ante Budimir for Mario Pa\u0161ali\u0107 instantly transformed the team. Croatia dominated the early exchanges and had a glorious opportunity to take the lead from the penalty spot when a VAR review concluded Davide Frattesi handled the ball inside the area. Modric saw his weak penalty kick saved by Donnarumma, only for the ball to fall back to the Croatia captain\u2019s feet less than a minute later. This time, he made no mistake, firing the ball into the roof of the net after the Italian keeper had denied Budimir from close range. Italy had the chance to respond almost immediately when Bastoni was left unmarked at a corner kick, but the defender spurned another glorious opportunity, this time placing his header over the crossbar. If the scored stayed the same, Bastoni more than most would have been in for a few sleepless nights while Italy waited to find out whether it would reach the last 16 as one of the four best third-placed teams. Fortunately for Bastoni, however, that nervous wait was avoided when Zaccagni made himself the unlikely hero with his first international goal, curling a sublime first-time effort into the top corner with unerring accuracy. No matter how unconvincing Italy look, underestimate the\u00a0Azzurri\u00a0at your peril. Few teams in world football know how to eke out a result when it matters the most and there will not be a country that relishes the prospect of facing this resilient Italy team.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/sport/euro-2024-italy-croatia-spain-albania-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Romania\u2019s 1-1 draw with Slovakia was enough for both teams to reach the round of 16, with the Slovaks qualifying as one of the four best third-placed teams. It was a heartbreaking end to the tournament for Ukraine, which exits Euro 2024 after finishing bottom of the group, despite picking up more points than some of the teams that qualified third from other groups. It is the first time in European Championship history that a team has won four points and finished bottom. Belgium\u2019s failure to top Group E, however, means the\u00a0Red Devils\u00a0now face the daunting task of taking on France in the round of 16. If Belgium plays as it has done so far this tournament, few people will give the team a chance against France. It was another sluggish, disjointed performance from Domenico Tedesco\u2019s side, who rarely troubled Ukraine throughout the clash. Belgium dominated possession for the opening 20 minutes, the team conducted by captain and star man Kevin De Bruyne in midfield, though the Red Devils were unable to really test Anatoliy Trubin in the Ukraine goal. Ukraine manager Serhiy Rebrov had made the bold call to drop both Oleksandr Zinchenko and captain Andriy Yarmolenko, while he was also without injured Chelsea forward Mykhailo Mudryk. Perhaps their replacements just needed time to find their feet as Ukraine burst to life halfway through the first half and began to put Belgium under sustained pressure. Roman Yaremchuk fired a shot from range which stung the palms of Koen Casteels, before Artem Dobvik disappointingly dragged his shot wide from the edge of the area. Yaremchuk perhaps should have given Ukraine the lead when a wonderfully worked short free kick set him free in the box, but he opted to cross the ball instead of shoot. Belgium only looked like a threat with De Bruyne on the ball and he was again carrying the team through another disappointing half of football at Euro 2024, brilliantly threading a ball into the path of Romelu Lukaku, who scuffed his effort when through on goal. Belgium suffered the biggest upset of the tournament in its opening 1-0 defeat to Slovakia and had De Bruyne largely to thank for a 2-0 win over Romania. With Belgium struggling to find any rhythm, Ukraine began to increasingly exert its dominance on the game. The impetus was on the Ukrainians, too, given the knowledge that with Romania and Slovakia drawing 1-1 at halftime, and the danger that they would finish bottom of Group E on goal difference, with all four teams on four points. Meanwhile, Belgium knew if the results stayed the same it would be in for a tough round of 16 clash against France, but a defeat would mean elimination. Both teams started to show a bit more intent as the game entered the final 20 minutes. Yannick Carrasco drew a smart save from Trubin, while Ruslan Malinovskyi almost caught out Casteels at his near post from a corner kick. Youngster Georgiy Sudakov perhaps should have won it for Ukraine in the closing minutes after making a brilliant slaloming run into the Belgium penalty area, but hit his shot straight at Casteels. The full-time whistle brought the Ukrainian players to their knees. It was a cruel way for its Euro 2024 adventure to come to an end, making history but for all the wrong reasons.

{"id": "2024_06_10_sport_carlos-alcaraz-french-open-tennis-spt-intl", "text": "As a child, Carlos Alcaraz used to run home from school to watch the French Open on TV, dreaming of one day playing on the tournament\u2019s clay courts and becoming champion. That dream became a reality on Sunday as the Spaniard defeated world No. 4 Alexander Zverev in five sets to lift his third grand slam title \u2013 all at the age of only 21. In a gritty and often unpredictable performance on Court Philippe-Chatrier, Alcaraz showed his trademark fight and resilience against Zverev, coming back from two sets to one down to become the youngest man to win major titles on clay, grass and hard courts. \u201cHonestly, first of all, I\u2019m exhausted,\u201d Alcaraz told CNN Sport\u2019s Amanda Davies the day after claiming his first title at Roland Garros. \u201cIt was a really tough one. It is a dream come true for me. I really wanted to lift this trophy one day, and then to be able to do it is a great feeling. \u201cThis tournament, I\u2019ve watched it since I was five, six years old \u2026 Being in this position right now is so, so special,\u201d he added. With Alcaraz\u2019s latest success comes yet another tattoo. He already has the dates of his grand slam wins at the US Open and Wimbledon \u2013 the latter alongside a strawberry synonymous with the tournament \u2013 inked on his skin, and now plans to get the Eiffel Tower and Sunday\u2019s date on his left ankle. It seems a fitting choice: after his victory in the City of Light, Alcaraz shared an old photo of himself aged 12, watching the tournament on a big screen in the shadow of the Paris landmark. Is he worried about running out of skin space, should he continue to accumulate more grand slam titles? \u201cThis is good news if that happens,\u201d said Alcaraz. \u201cI said to my family and to my team that it\u2019s going to be the first grand slam. If I win another French Open, I\u2019m not going to get a tattoo.\u201d With his victory over Zverev, the world No. 2 joins a long line of Spanish men to have lifted the French Open title. Rafael Nadal leads the way with a record-breaking 14 titles, while Juan Carlos Ferrero, Albert Costa, Carlos Moy\u00e1 and Sergi Bruguera have all been champions since 1993. \u201cI really wanted to put my name on that list as well,\u201d said Alcaraz, who is now coached by 2003 winner Ferrero. Having sustained an arm injury ahead of this year\u2019s French Open, the Murcia native withdrew from the Italian Open but has exceeded his expectations physically over the past two weeks, winning four of his seven matches in three sets. It was only against Zverev and new world No. 1 Jannik Sinner that Alcaraz went the distance \u2013 the first man in the Open Era to win the final and the semifinal of the French Open in five sets. After losing the third set against Zverev, letting slip a 5-2 lead, he had to dig deep into his energy reserves and raise his intensity, racing around the court and chasing down every shot. The two highlights were a so-called \u201cbanana\u201d forehand \u2013 made famous by Nadal \u2013 in the fourth set and a stunning backhand passing shot when Alcaraz had seemed certain to lose the point in the deciding set. \u201cIf I lost, I wanted to do it fighting until the last ball, running, playing my best tennis,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I thought about in that moment: to keep trying to find solutions.\u201d Alcaraz\u2019s attention now turns to Wimbledon, where he will defend the title he won in dramatic fashion against Novak Djokovic last year, and then the Olympics in Paris, which will mean a return to Roland Garros. There, he hopes to play doubles alongside Nadal \u2013 potentially one of the 22-time grand slam champion\u2019s final tournaments \u2013 as well as going for a gold medal in the singles competition. \u201cI\u2019ve won Roland Garros and I\u2019m going for the Olympics,\u201d said Alcaraz. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to get both.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/sport/carlos-alcaraz-french-open-tennis-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}

WNBA Hall of Famer Sheryl Swoopes, New York Knicks star Jalen Brunson, rappers Chance the Rapper and Lil Durk and actor Jason Sudeikis were all in attendance in Chicago to watch the third meeting of the two teams this season. Clark and the Fever had won the previous two meetings, but it proved to be third time lucky for the Sky who prevailed in a tense game. Reese had a dominant outing, finishing with a career-high 25 points and 16 rebounds to extend her WNBA rookie record double-double streak to eight straight games, becoming the third player in league history to reach that mark joining Sylvia Fowles and Candace Parker. \u201cThis is what I do: I come out and perform,\u201d Reese told reporters afterwards, per ESPN. \u201cI do what it takes to win every single day.\u201d Clark also had a strong performance, scoring 17 points and dishing out 13 assists. USA Today\u2019s Nancy Armour described the atmosphere as \u201celectric \u2026 the kind of energy this city hasn\u2019t seen for a professional basketball game since the Jordan years.\u201d In the two previous meetings between the Sky and the Fever this WNBA season, the hard-fought nature of the action has been the main talking point. In both games, Clark has been on the end of flagrant fouls, first from Chennedy Carter and then from Reese. But Sunday\u2019s game was played largely without incident. It began with a tight first half, with seven ties and eight lead changes. However, the Fever built up a 15-point lead midway through the third quarter, only for the Sky to race back and tie the game at 82 with three minutes left. With the score tied at 84 with just under a minute left, Reese made a driving layup to put Chicago up by two. The Sky would hold on to the lead to get their sixth win of the season. Reese top scored for Chicago, while she was aided by Carter\u2019s 23 points. For Indiana, Kelsey Mitchell recorded a team-high 24 points with reigning Rookie of the Year Aliyah Boston adding 18 points. The 22-year-old Reese became the first rookie in Sky franchise history with 20 or more points and 15 or more rebounds in a game while Clark set her own piece of history, becoming the first rookie in WNBA history with 15+ points, 10+ assists and 5+ three pointers made in a game. Clark and Reese\u2019s rivalry has been well-documented ever since their high-profile clash in the 2023 NCAA championship game. \u201cIt\u2019s good for the game, good for women\u2019s basketball, but also good for women\u2019s sports,\u201d Reese said of the crowd, per ESPN. \u201cYou see NBA players, rappers, legends that played in the league for a great long time come out and show support. You know everybody\u2019s watching right now. \u201cI think this is one of the most important times right now, and we just continue to keep putting on. I think both teams tonight did an amazing job putting on a show. It was fun. I had a great time, I\u2019m sure the other team had a great time.\u201d The victory means the Sky improve to 6-9 on the season while the defeat ends Indiana\u2019s four-game winning streak and sees them slip to 7-11.

{"id": "2024_06_26_sport_nba-draft-how-to-watch-spt-intl", "text": "The next wave of NBA talent is ready to take center stage. The 2024 NBA Draft\u2019s two days of action begin on Wednesday, with the Atlanta Hawks set to make the No. 1 overall selection for the first time in the post-1985 Draft lottery era. While there is no generational prospect in the mold of Victor Wembanyama at the top of this year\u2019s class, there is still plenty of talent primed to make an impact in the world\u2019s best professional league. How to watch the 2024 NBA Draft For the first time in the history of the current format \u2013 which began in 1989 \u2013 the Draft will be held across two days, following in the footsteps of the US\u2019 three other major sports leagues, which hold their drafts across multiple days. First round picks will hear their names called at the Brooklyn Nets\u2019 Barclays Center on Wednesday night with the second round taking place at ESPN\u2019s Seaport District Studios the following day on June 27. The first round of the draft will be broadcast from 8 p.m. ET on both ABC and ESPN, while the second round begins at 4 p.m. ET on ESPN. International representation With basketball continuing to grow on a global scale, teams are increasingly turning their attention to overseas prospects, with the NBA\u2019s consensus mock draft suggesting that at least four of the 14 lottery picks could be from outside the US. It appears that a Frenchman will be first off the board for the second year running, though unlike the 2023 draft, there is more than one player in the mix. Zaccharie Risacher and Alexandre Sarr have both been linked with the No. 1 pick leading up to the Draft, with mock drafts swinging in Risacher\u2019s favor in recent days. Risacher spent last season with French club JL Bourg-en-Bresse of France\u2019s LNB \u00c9lite league and could develop into an elite \u2018three-and-D\u2019 small forward for the Hawks if selected first overall. With a six-foot-eight frame and a long wingspan, he is expected to make an impact on the defensive end immediately, an area where rookies typically struggle. Meanwhile, Sarr \u2013 who played for the Perth Wildcats of the Australian National Basketball League \u2013 could begin the season as the starting center for the Washington Wizards, who own the No. 2 overall pick. Reports speculate that the Hawks are leaning towards Risacher after Sarr declined a pre-draft workout with the team. Sarr clarified that his camp advised him to take the decision, saying that being drafted is the priority but that he still wants to be the No. 1 pick. Forward Matas Buzelis \u2013 born in Chicago but of Lithuanian heritage \u2013 has also been touted as a potential top-five selection. The 19-year-old\u2019s blend of height, ball-handling ability, playmaking and shooting upside means that he fits the archetype of the modern NBA wing. Buzelis raised eyebrows earlier this year when he challenged Risacher to a one-on-one matchup. \u201cOf course, I want to see him one-on-one,\u201d Buzelis told Lithuanian outlet Basket News in March. \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t want to do that with me. His agent will not do that with me, and I know he won\u2019t. It\u2019s a business decision. \u201cMy advantage is that I have everything over him.\u201d Buzelis followed up by stating that he \u201crespects\u201d Risacher as a player but doubled down on his comments the day before the draft. \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t want to see me. I\u2019m just going to keep it real with everybody,\u201d he said with a smile on his face. Serbian point guard Nikola Topi\u0107 is another name to keep an eye on, though he was recently diagnosed with a partially torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), which could affect his draft stock. Another Frenchman, Tidjane Sala\u00fcn, could potentially find his way into the lottery or even the top 10. College prospects Despite the influx of talent from abroad in recent years and a perceived drop in star power in men\u2019s college basketball compared to previous seasons, there are still plenty of skilled NBA-ready players at the collegiate level. While Risacher and Sarr are heavily predicted go at one and two, former Kentucky sharpshooter Reed Sheppard has a strong case to be selected just behind them. A late-season surge in scoring by the combo guard turned the heads of NBA scouts, who have seemingly taken note of his ability to perform on the offensive end as well as stifle opponents on the other side of the ball. Listed around six-foot-two, Sheppard is often credited for playing bigger than his size. Towering UConn center Donovan Clingan has also received pre-draft plaudits and has drawn comparisons to four-time defensive player of the year Rudy Gobert. Expected to have an impact as a dominating interior presence from day one in the league, it is unlikely to see Clingan fall out of the top 10. Reigning two-time consensus national player of the year Zach Edey is another player who can be a game-changer in the paint. The seven-foot-four, 300-pound center is the tallest player in Big Ten conference history and his seemingly unstoppable post presence and footwork made him one of the most dominant players in college, though there are concerns about his skillset not translating to the NBA. Wings Stephon Castle, Cody Williams and Dalton Knecht are all candidates to fill out the top 10, while Ron Holland II remains an intriguing prospect. He chose to play for the NBA\u2019s developmental G-League Ignite team \u2013 alongside Buzelis \u2013 instead of attending college. Bronny James, son of NBA all-time leading scorer LeBron James is expected to go towards the end of the second round, possibly at No. 55 to the Los Angeles Lakers where he could team up with his father. Full draft order Teams are able to trade picks on draft night. The Phoenix Suns and Philadelphia 76ers have each lost a second-round pick due to a league penalty, meaning that there will be 58 selections made rather than the usual 60. First round 1.

Another phenomenon over the opening 12 days of the European soccer championship, however, has been fans throwing plastic beer cups onto pitches, or onto other fans.

Some players have responded with levity \u2013 notably France\u2019s Antoine Griezmann who shared a smile with the Netherlands supporters throwing cups near him at the corner flag. Other players have cleared debris from the pitch less cheerfully. Social media clips from Monday\u2019s tie showed Italy fans in the lower tiers voicing their anger at their Croatian counterparts in the upper stands after being covered in beer, while journalists were also caught in the crossfire. The BBC commentary pairing at the game in Leipzig, Jonathan Pearce and former England international Danny Murphy, painted a particularly vivid picture of what was happening around them during their live coverage. \u201cWe\u2019re getting soaked,\u201d Murphy said, while Pearce added: \u201cWe\u2019re getting absolutely drenched up here.\u201d \u201cThis cannot continue, the cups being thrown from the stands,\u201d Pearce said later in commentary. \u201cPlayers are experiencing plastic cups being thrown at the pitch and it\u2019s happening more and more. \u201cI was speaking to some Germans yesterday and they were saying they won\u2019t let it carry on. They will stop people drinking.\u201d UEFA \u2013 European soccer\u2019s governing body \u2013 said in a statement to CNN that its disciplinary body will \u201cawait reports\u201d from the match between Italy and Croatia \u201cbefore considering any action.\u201d Regarding addressing the throwing of beer cups in future games, UEFA had no update. According to The Athletic, fans have to pay a \u20ac3 ($3.22) deposit for a cup in addition to another \u20ac6 ($6.44) minimum for the beer itself. Drinking alcohol in the terraces isn\u2019t something that is widely done in world soccer. In the UK, it is strictly prohibited, with drinking only permitted on the concourses.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/sport/beer-cups-throwing-euro-2024-corners-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_sport_bronny-james-nba-draft-spt-intl", "text": "One of the biggest talking points heading into the 2024 NBA Draft has been the future of Bronny James. The son of NBA legend and all-time leading scorer LeBron James, Bronny entered this year\u2019s draft pool, following one year at the University of Southern California after recovering from a cardiac arrest last summer. Though his stats at USC were relatively underwhelming \u2013 4.8 points, 2.8 rebounds and 2.1 assists per game on under 37% shooting from the field \u2013 Bronny has drawn praise for his athleticism and defensive capabilities. His true draft stock has become difficult to evaluate as a result of a small sample size, uncertain potential and unprecedented hype for a non-lottery pick. Despite this, the younger James has been projected as a second-round pick by multiple outlets, with the Ringer, Bleacher Report and ESPN all anticipating that he will be selected 55th overall by the Los Angeles Lakers. The elder James has previously spoken of his strong desire to play with his son in the NBA. \u201cMy last year will be played with my son,\u201d James told\u00a0the Athletic in 2022. \u201cWherever Bronny is at, that\u2019s where I\u2019ll be. I would do whatever it takes to play with my son for one year. It\u2019s not about the money at that point.\u201d With James potentially entering free agency this summer \u2013 he has until Saturday to decide to take up his player option for over $51 million or opt out of his current Lakers contract \u2013 speculation is rife over him leaving LA for a team that drafts Bronny. However, sharing a team with his son is apparently now less of a priority for the 20-time All-Star than it has been in the past. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t given it much thought lately,\u201d James said in April. \u201cObviously, I thought about it in the past, but at the end of the day, the kid has to do what he wants to do. I don\u2019t even want to say kid anymore, the young man will decide what to do and how he wants to decide how he wants his career to go.\u201d Bronny has also been linked to the Phoenix Suns, which is the only other team aside from the Lakers that he has taken part in a pre-draft workout with. His agent, Klutch Sports founder Rich Paul, told ESPN that this was \u201cby design\u201d and said that he had advised teams to not offer the 19-year-old a two-way deal \u2013 which second-round picks often sign \u2013 that would see him spend time in the NBA\u2019s developmental G-League. \u201cI got the word out early to teams that if you plan on bringing Bronny in, here\u2019s what you need to know: If you won\u2019t give him a real deal, there\u2019s nothing to talk about,\u201d said Paul. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get real development on a two-way deal.\u201d According to Paul \u2013 who counts the elder James, Anthony Davis and Draymond Green among his NBA clients \u2013 multiple teams around the league have expressed an interest in Bronny, including the Minnesota Timberwolves, Dallas Mavericks and Toronto Raptors. \u201cIf it\u2019s not the Lakers, it will be someone else,\u201d Paul said. It will remain to be seen whether the younger James will be selected by the Lakers, another team or not drafted at all when the NBA Draft kicks off.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/sport/bronny-james-nba-draft-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_sport_afghanistan-historic-semifinal-t20-cricket-world-cup-spt-intl", "text": "Pakistan exited cricket\u2019s T20 World Cup at the group stage. Australia \u2013 one of the sport\u2019s heavyweights \u2013 couldn\u2019t get past the Super 8 stage. And it\u00a0was\u00a0at\u00a0Australia\u2019s expense that Afghanistan reached the semifinals, a success sparking mass scenes of celebrations back home. After reaching the tournament\u2019s final four,\u00a0the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) posted videos of swarms of fans flooding the streets to celebrate the team\u2019s historic run. The team was also congratulated by a myriad of influential figures from the country, including former president Ashraf Ghani and the Taliban\u2019s foreign minister, Mullah Amir Muttaqi, and minister of information and culture, Mullah Khairullah Khairkhah. For a country which has been torn apart through wars and suffered natural disasters such as May\u2019s floods,\u00a0Afghanistan captain Rashid\u00a0Khan\u00a0is conscious that his team\u2019s success provides a degree of happiness for Afghan cricket fans. Those floods came after drought in Afghanistan and are a dramatic\u00a0example of\u00a0the\u00a0climate crisis hitting those who have least contributed to rising global temperatures. \u201cCricket is the only source of happiness back home, you all know that,\u201d\u00a0Khan told reporters after the impressive victory over Australia earlier in the tournament He added: \u201cWe hardly see those kind of events\u00a0back home where they can celebrate and enjoy those moments, but these games in the World Cups give them so much happiness and that\u2019s something which really, really satisfies me. I don\u2019t care about taking one wicket, two, three, five, six\u00a0wickets. \u201cBut when I see those people having those smiles, those celebrations back home in every street\u00a0of\u00a0Afghanistan, that is something that gives me so much energy and also motivates me\u00a0for the upcoming games.\u201d Afghanistan\u2019s knack of upsetting many of the favored teams at the T20 World Cup\u00a0in its\u00a0historic run to the final four of the competition\u00a0as well as\u00a0a\u00a0unique approach to the game \u2013 see Gulbadin Naib\u2019s sudden cramp after being instructed by head coach Jonathan Trott to slow down \u2013\u00a0has been arguably the story of the tournament so far. The team will now make its first ever appearance at the semifinal\u00a0stage when it takes on South Africa in Trinidad and Tobago on Wednesday at 8.30 p.m. ET. Proving doubters wrong Whereas many of cricket\u2019s more established nations have been playing for over a century, the sport is still, by comparison, in its nascent stage in Afghanistan. As Raees Ahmadzai, the former captain of the Afghan national cricket team, told CNN in 2019, the roots of Afghan cricket\u2019s unprecedented surge lie in the\u00a0refugee camps near the Pakistani-Afghan border \u2013 one cricket-obsessed nation passing on the bug to another. The national cricket board was only founded in 1995, and it was only recognized as an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2001. Now, the sport is the most popular in the country and its team is full of recognizable names to cricket fans all around the world. As well as captain Khan \u2013 one of the sport\u2019s best spin bowlers \u2013 the veteran figures of Mohammad Nabi, Naib and Hashmatullah Shahidi have been regulars on the international stage for years now. But the team\u2019s\u00a0remarkable\u00a0run through the tournament has been spearheaded by many of Afghanistan\u2019s newer faces. Afghanistan\u2019s\u00a0pair of 22-year-old batters, Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran, are the first- and third-highest run scorers in the tournament so far, and 23-year-old quick bowler Fazalhaq Farooqi is the World Cup\u2019s leading wicket-taker. Despite often having star talent, Afghanistan has struggled to put it all together when it matters most, going out in the second round in each of the past three T20 World Cups and never making it out of the group stage in the longer-format One Day International (ODI) World Cup. Under head coach Trott though, it has found a recipe for winning.  The team\u2019s\u00a0diverse spin attack \u2013 the three-pronged approach of Khan, Nabi and Noor Ahmad \u2013 has left opposing batters bamboozled,\u00a0while its opening pairing of Gurbaz and Zadran have given it promising starts to games. Nothing highlighted the team\u2019s qualities more than its victory over Bangladesh to qualify for the semifinals. Gurbaz scored 43 runs to give\u00a0Afghanistan\u2019s\u00a0batting line-up a boost while Khan collected four Bangladeshi wickets to stifle any chances of a stable run chase. \u201cI think the semifinal is going to be a massive, massive inspiration for the youngsters back home in Afghanistan,\u201d said Khan. \u201cThat Afghanistan team got into the semis for the first time,\u201d the 25-year-old told the International Cricket Council (ICC) website. \u201cAnd we have done it Under-19 level, but at this level, we haven\u2019t done that (before). Even Super Eight was first time for us and then in semis. It\u2019s an unbelievable feeling.\u201d A women\u2019s team While the men\u2019s team is thriving on the international stage, Afghanistan\u2019s\u00a0approach to women\u2019s\u00a0cricket\u00a0has been widely criticized. Afghanistan is the only ICC full member nation without a women\u2019s team. The Taliban became the controlling power in Afghanistan in 2021 after the United States\u2019 chaotic, controversial withdrawal from the country after nearly 20 years of fighting. The regime immediately restricted the ability for women and girls to participate in sports, as well as limiting their opportunities in many other areas of life. Many of the country\u2019s professional female athletes fled Afghanistan in the wake of the Taliban\u2019s takeover to continue to pursue their sporting careers, with the national team\u2019s football and cricket players leaving to Australia under the threat of death. In March, Australia postponed its T20 series against Afghanistan, citing worsening \u2018conditions for women and girls\u2019 in the country under Taliban rule while there have been no indications that a women\u2019s cricket team will be coming anytime soon. Barney Ronay, journalist for the Guardian, wrote that\u00a0Wednesday\u2019s\u00a0semifinal will \u201cbe contested by a nation that refuses to permit women\u2019s sport and has disbanded its women\u2019s cricket team. This is where platitudes meet reality for the ICC.\u201d In a statement sent to CNN, the ICC said it would not \u201cpenalize the ACB, or its players for abiding by the laws set by the government of their country. We will continue to constructively use our influence to assist the ACB in developing cricket and playing opportunities for both men and women in Afghanistan.\u201d The sport\u2019s governing body added that Afghanistan didn\u2019t have a women\u2019s cricket program when it became a full member and that the ICC\u2019s position is consistent with other major sporting federations such as FIFA and the International Olympic Committee. When Australia postponed that T20 series against Afghanistan earlier this year,\u00a0Suhail Shaheen, the Taliban\u2019s spokesman in Doha, questioned what\u00a0he\u00a0called the CA\u2019s politicization of cricket. \u201cWe keep politics separate from sport. Otherwise, [we] all know the atrocities of the Australian soldiers in Afghanistan who killed innocent children and women. At that time, they had forgotten about women\u2019s rights,\u201d Shaheen told CNN. And in a statement posted online, the Afghanistan Cricket Board expressed its \u201cdisappointment\u201d towards Australia\u2019s decision and \u201creiterates its stance on neutral and politics-free cricket across the globe.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/sport/afghanistan-historic-semifinal-t20-cricket-world-cup-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_23_sport_protesters-disrupt-travelers-championship", "text": "Protesters ran onto the 18th green in the final round of the PGA Tour\u2019s Travelers Championship in Cromwell, Connecticut, Sunday, leaving a powdery substance on the putting surface and delaying play for several minutes. Video from broadcaster CBS showed several of the six demonstrators wearing shirts reading: \u201cNo golf on a dead planet.\u201d Extinction Rebellion, a climate activist group, said it was behind the incident. Police quickly removed the protesters, allowing the final group, including leaders Tom Kim and Scottie Scheffler to finish the hole in a tie and move to a playoff. The pair teed off on the 18th again and Scheffler went on to win. He said he and Kim helped to steady each other as the police worked quickly. \u201cYou don\u2019t really know what is going on, you don\u2019t really understand the situation,\u201d Scheffler said in a post-match interview with CBS Sports. \u201cThere\u2019s people running around everywhere and you don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d He credited the police with doing a great job to handcuff and remove the protesters. The protesters were accused of one count each of criminal mischief in the first degree, criminal trespass in the first degree and breach of Peace, according to a news release from the Cromwell Police Department. They each were released on a bond of $5,000 and are due in court July 1.  Kim told reporters it was like a dream but the moment temporarily took his mind off the importance of making his putt because he was worried about people getting hurt. In a social media video, officers can be seen wrestling three protesters on the ground. Another protester is tackled by an officer and drops a bag they were holding. Fans can be heard booing and yelling obscenities at the protesters. Sina Sadri, the 19-year-old fan who recorded the video, said he had looked away and when he returned his eyes to the green area there was a guy in the bunker. \u201cI instinctively took out my phone and started recording \u2013 and the mayhem unfolded,\u201d he told CNN. He described the demonstrators as using devices that left behind powder, not paint. There was a firework-like smell in the air, he said. At the players\u2019 news conference, Scheffler said the initial chaos with people running around was a little rattling. \u201cYou don\u2019t know if they\u2019re peaceful, you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing, you have no idea what\u2019s going on, so it can be a bit stressful,\u201d he told reporters. A PGA Tour senior spokesperson told CNN the protesters were \u201cimmediately arrested.\u201d \u201cThe powder on the green was removed, resulting in no damage to the 18th green,\u201d Joel Schuchmann said. \u201cOur thanks to the Cromwell Police Department for their quick and decisive action.\u201d CNN has reached out to law enforcement for more information. In a statement released shortly after the incident, Extinction Rebellion said it was trying to draw attention to climate change. \u201cWith this action, Extinction Rebellion is NOT protesting any individual or organization. Rather, the protest highlights the worldwide danger of climate breakdown,\u201d\u00a0the group said in its statement. \u201cGolf, more than other events, is heavily reliant on good weather. Golf fans should therefore understand better than most the need for strong, immediate climate action,\u201d the group added. Extinction Rebellion has a reputation for attention-grabbing tactics. Its activists have made international headlines for past protests including dumping green dye into Venice\u2019s Grand Canal, gluing themselves to a Picasso painting, smashing bank windows and spraying fake blood over buildings to call attention to climate issues. \u201cAt this point, the sole option remaining is to engage in unconventional forms of protest that bring attention to the severity of the climate emergency,\u201d the group said in its release.

{"id": "2023_02_05_sport_head-injury-suicide-female-athletes-intl-spt-cmd", "text": "Kelly Catlin and Ellie Soutter never met, but they had a lot in common.  Both were commanding athletes: Catlin, a US track cyclist, was a three-times world champion and Olympic silver medalist, and Soutter, a snowboarder, was tipped to be one of Team Great Britain\u2019s strongest contenders for the 2022 Winter Olympics, having already won a bronze medal at the 2017 European Youth Olympic Festival.  Both were incredibly smart \u2013 Catlin was studying for a master\u2019s degree in computational and mathematical engineering at Stanford University, while Soutter learned to speak French in about six months, according to her father.   At times they almost seemed superhuman. In 2013, after only three weeks of formal training and having broken her wrist, Soutter became British Champion with her arm in a cast. Meanwhile, Catlin, who had a tenderness for children, once rode 80 miles through sleet and snow to speak to a grade school about her Olympic experience.    Yet these two women\u2019s lives were tragically cut short after they sustained serious head injuries in their pursuit of sporting greatness and then took their own lives. Catlin was 23, while Soutter died by suicide on her 18th birthday.  Females may be more susceptible to concussion, and they also have worse and prolonged symptoms after their injury than men, according to a review of 25 studies of sport-related concussion published in the Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine.  However, women remain significantly underrepresented within sport and exercise science research. This, leading experts warn, means they often do not get the treatment or aftercare they need following a head injury.  Women\u2019s sports have historically not received the same attention or funding as men\u2019s sports, Dr. Ann McKee, Director of the Boston University Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s been shown that women athletes are more likely to get a concussion, they tend to have longer recovery periods,\u201d McKee added. \u201cWe do not have enough information about what happens in the female brain. We don\u2019t know if women are biologically more susceptible to these injuries,\u201d she said, adding that some research suggests the size and musculature of women\u2019s necks could play a part. Kelly  Before becoming a track cyclist, Catlin, a triplet, was a national champion road cyclist and time trial national champion, her father Mark, told CNN. After winning a Canadian international race at 17 she was invited to an Olympic training camp for a try out, where, impressed by her performance numbers, coaches immediately offered her a position on the track pursuit team.  Catlin\u2019s father, Mark, told CNN, that his daughter was \u201cintense\u201d and \u201cambitious,\u201d attributes she channeled into her sporting life. Her life changed irrevocably in January 2019. Practicing fast downhill descents in the hills near Los Angeles, she crashed and went skidding down the road.  Despite suffering road rash, Catlin got back on her bike, and finished the ride. It wasn\u2019t her first crash \u2013 she had experienced 4 or 5 hard crashes before this, her father said, and after the latest, she didn\u2019t have any symptoms at the time.  But soon after, at a World Cup track event in Berlin, Catlin was gripped by a sudden and severe headache.   \u201cShe couldn\u2019t compete,\u201d her father said. \u201cKelly is kind of this stoical individual. And if she\u2019s rolling around on the ground, clutching her head, it has to be a severe thing.\u201d On closer inspection, Catlin\u2019s helmet from LA had dents in it. Her father told CNN that this, coupled with her symptoms, caused her family to become aware she had suffered a concussion, which was later confirmed with a diagnosis from Stanford\u2019s Health Centre.  A concussion is a brain injury which happens after a hit to the head or body causes the brain to move back and forth inside the skull, according to the CDC. When Catlin returned to the US, her father says she was examined by the track training center in Colorado. It was confirmed she suffered a concussion, and a return to training protocol was advised, but not implemented or communicated to her coach, he said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any follow-up from Colorado after this. I believe they assumed she would seek care at Stanford,\u201d he told CNN.  CNN has reached out to Stanford and USA Cycling for comment.  Catlin\u2019s symptoms didn\u2019t improve, and in weekly phone calls with her parents, she admitted she was struggling with schoolwork and was unable to concentrate. Stanford Health Center, having diagnosed Catlin with concussion with ongoing symptoms, recommended that she decrease her training for 2 weeks and then gradually build back up and start sessions with an athletic trainer, medical documents sent to CNN by her father show. She was referred to a concussion specialist, the document adds. She tried to train, but \u201cshe would have to stop because she got a severe headache just from walking,\u201d according to her father. Her heart rate would also accelerate rapidly from even the smallest exertion, leaving her with \u201cno exercise tolerance whatsoever,\u201d he added.  Her injury had other consequences. \u201cAs far as we knew she was never a person that suffered from depression. She had an interesting sense of humor.  She was always upbeat and bubbly about things,\u201d her father told CNN.  \u201cShe basically thought her life was over. She was no longer able to be the athlete that she was, she was failing her teammates. And she wasn\u2019t able to succeed in school now. And I think ultimately, that\u2019s why she took her life, because she thought her life was over,\u201d he added.  At the end of January, Catlin made a serious but non-fatal suicide attempt, and was involuntarily admitted to the locked psychiatric ward at Stanford, her father told CNN. A month after that attempt, she took her own life.     Ellie   Soutter\u2019s father Tony said there were many dimensions to his young daughter \u2013 not only was she an \u201cadrenaline junkie,\u201d but she was \u201cvery conscientious\u201d and excelled in school, even after moving from England to France.   Aged 12, Soutter took up snowboarding at school \u2013 and just months later, she was spotted in her hometown resort of Les Gets and trialed by Team Great Britain in February 2013.  \u201cIt was quite obvious why she kept winning competitions because she just made it easy,\u201d her father said. \u201cShe just made it look graceful and beautiful.\u201d But training took its toll \u2013 Soutter told CNN that his daughter suffered seven major concussions in five years, between 2013 and 2018.  \u201cI was being advised by doctors \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, she\u2019s young enough she\u2019ll bounce back. As she progressed, becoming an elite athlete starting on the World Cup circuit, every time she had another concussion, they got worse, and they took longer to recover from,\u201d he told CNN.     \u201cWith every concussion, with the exception of a few minor knocks, Ellie saw a doctor in person,\u201d he added. \u201cI was always told that she was young enough to bounce back to full health after each case and therefore never consulted with the doctors that I met, about any previous concussions.\u201d But Soutter\u2019s final concussion was so \u201chuge\u201d that she spent two nights in the hospital. \u201cWhen I got there, she didn\u2019t even know who I was or where she was,\u201d her father said. Soutter was then selected for the Junior Snowboard World Championships in New Zealand August 2018.  But a month before the competition, she died by suicide.  Her father said a neurologist conducted a CT scan of her brain and reaction tests three months after her final concussion, but said she was \u201cabsolutely fine\u201d and could continue competing.                                                                                                                                 Like Catlin, Soutter had issues with studying and concentrating, becoming more insular as she suffered from crippling headaches. She also started suffering from insomnia.  \u201cShe would literally sit with the tutor a good month after a concussion, and suddenly, she\u2019d go blind. She\u2019d not be able to see \u2013 everything would go black and dark,\u201d her father said. After missing a flight to snowboard training, Soutter died by suicide on her 18th birthday. Team GB referred CNN to GB Snowsport when approached for comment, adding that Ellie only competed for Team GB at one event.  In order to represent Britain in international competitions, GB Snowsport says athletes or their coaches are required to demonstrate that the athlete has reached established performance criteria, is of the relevant technical ability to compete, and has appropriate medical clearance to compete. A large number of athletes can represent Britain at different levels of international competition but are not part of a programme delivered and overseen by GB Snowsport.  \u201cAs Ellie was not part of the GB Snowsport programme, we were unable to implement a personalised recovery and management programme for Ellie,\u201d a spokesperson for GB Snowsport told CNN in an email. \u201cShe was, however, covered by national policies and protocols around fitness to compete, and would not have been cleared for any activity \u2013 training or competition \u2013 overseen by GB Snowsport without being able to demonstrate appropriate medical sign-off,\u201d they added. The spokesperson for GB Snowsport told CNN: \u201cWe take concussions and head injuries incredibly seriously, and in reviewing contemporaneous records from the time that Ellie was involved in snowsport we are confident that GB Snowsport staff applied and followed every appropriate process.\u201d Catlin and Soutter aren\u2019t the only young sporting women whose lives have been cut short in this way. After 29-year-old Australian rules football player Jacinda Barclay took her life in 2020, post-mortem research by scientists found that she had degradation to her cerebral white matter unusual for someone her age.  \u201cFor someone her age, you would expect to see lovely pristine white matter, and hers looked like she was an old woman in that it was basically degraded,\u201d Michael Buckland, founder and Executive Director of the Australian Sports Brain Bank, who studied Barclay\u2019s brain, told CNN.  \u201cWe haven\u2019t gone back and done specific white matter studies on our donors,\u201d he told CNN, adding that the bank hasn\u2019t done peer reviewed research on this.  \u201cBut what struck me, just as someone that sees a lot of brains \u2013 this is not normal for someone of that age.\u201d  Damage to white matter has been associated with dementia, according to research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.   Opportunities missed Suicide after concussion is rare. However patients diagnosed with concussion or mild traumatic brain injury had double the risk of suicide and a higher risk of suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts than people without brain injuries, a 2018 study from researchers at the University of Harvard published in JAMA Neurology found. Dr. Robert Cantu, clinical professor of neurology at the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at Boston University School of Medicine told CNN that there are several theories as to why incidence of suicide is higher in people who have suffered concussion. One theory, he explained, is that those suffering from persistent post-concussion symptoms may have structural or functional brain damage and could be experiencing \u201cbehavioral dysregulation: short fuse, irritability, [and] can\u2019t suppress impulses the way you normally could.\u201d   With these emotional problems, \u201cthey would be more prone to perhaps do something impulsive, like commit suicide,\u201d Cantu, medical director of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, told CNN. A second theory, Cantu noted, is that post-concussive symptoms prevent people from getting back into their sport and stop them \u201cfrom being the person that they were before their injury.\u201d Neither theory is proven to the exclusion of the other, Cantu said, adding he thinks increased suicidality was \u201ca combined factor involving both in many, if not most cases.\u201d There are also differences in the way brain injuries affect women.  A study of female soccer players across US high schools found they are nearly twice as likely to suffer concussion as their male counterparts, according to research that looked at over 80,000 adolescent athletes, published in the journal JAMA Network Open.  Women remain significantly underrepresented within sport and exercise science research: a 2021 study examining papers from some of the most influential sports medical journals found that only 6% of the studies were solely focused on women, compared with 31% of studies that included just men. Other researchers have pointed to female sex hormones, with risk of concussion changing with hormone levels during a menstrual cycle.  McKee said all athletes can also experience \u201cnon-concussive\u201d injuries: \u201chits to the head that can be of the same magnitude as concussion, but they don\u2019t rise to the level of symptoms for whatever reason, so a player tends to play right through it.\u201d Cumulative exposure to repetitive head impacts \u2013 including concussion and non- concussive injuries \u2013 increases the risk for the neurodegenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known as CTE, McKee said.  The disease, which can only be formally diagnosed with an autopsy, has mostly been seen in either veterans or people who played contact sports, particularly American football, say researchers. The disease occurs when the brain starts to degenerate likely due to repeated head traumas, according to the Mayo Clinic, which notes CTE is \u201cassociated with recurrent concussions.\u201d But scientists aren\u2019t only concerned about concussions.  Previous studies have shown subconcussive head impacts \u2013 repetitive hits to the head and body that do not cause symptoms \u2013 can still result in long-term neurological disease.   According to The Concussion Legacy Foundation, \u201cthe best available evidence suggests that subconcussive impacts, not concussions, are the driving force behind CTE.\u201d There have been cases of CTE discovered in athletes who have never been diagnosed with a concussion, according to the Concussion Legacy Foundation. And other changes in the brain after repetitive head impacts aside from CTE are likely \u201cequally important,\u201d McKee said. \u201cWe also see damage to the white matter. And that appears to be mostly in the frontal lobe, but also in the temporal lobes,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to understand the relationship of those white matter changes to behavioral and mood symptoms, perhaps even suicidality,\u201d she said.  McKee stressed that concussion management is important, but physicians and athletes should also be aware of other injuries. \u201cThe problem is the subclinical hits \u2013 the non-concussive injuries that aren\u2019t detected, you don\u2019t pull the player off the field \u2013 and they can be in the hundreds or even the 1000s in a single season,\u201d she explained. Lack of research  Though a growing body of data suggests women in sport are more likely to sustain a concussion, have more severe symptoms, and to take longer to recover, most sports-related concussions protocols are based on data from men.  In a review in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers looked at 171 concussion studies written since 1967 which are used to inform the most influential consensus and position statements in treating sports-related concussions. Clinicians rely on these documents to guide their medical practice when treating athletes \u2013 but most of the studies are focused on men. Only 1% of them was looking exclusively at concussions in women and 40% of them didn\u2019t have any women in a sample of participants at all.   There is another risk factor for women in sport when they sustain head injuries, Katherine Snedaker, founder and executive director of PINK Concussions, a non-profit dedicated to women\u2019s health and brain injury, told CNN.  There is a gulf of millions of dollars separating women and men when it comes to average annual salaries in most professional sports. Outside of elite sport, Snedaker says, female athletes often don\u2019t have access to the same medical care as men, meaning head injuries aren\u2019t spotted as routinely.   \u201cThey tend to push really hard through the injury,\u201d she said. And many women can\u2019t afford to take time out to recover: even professional athletes will supplement their sports income with other jobs, she added, and many are caregivers. \u201cWhen they really crater, it\u2019s a couple of days or weeks later.\u201d  Snedaker said female athletes often weren\u2019t aware they had suffered a head injury. If they were, she said, there were no appropriate medical or sporting staff to inform. Not enough support The families of Catlin and Soutter feel the young women didn\u2019t get enough support after their injuries. After Catlin\u2019s first suicide attempt, she was released from an involuntary admission to the psychiatric ward after threatening legal action, and a conference between psychiatrists, her coach and her parents.  She attended therapy sessions, which she agreed to attend during the conference, but found \u201cthey were geared toward suicidal freshman with a whole set of different issues than an elite Olympic athlete,\u201d her father told CNN. She got a referral to a sports psychologist that worked with the Stanford athletic department, but the department forbade the psychologist from seeing Catlin because she was not a varsity athlete, her father added.  She contacted the office of a sports psychologist with whom she had developed a rapport while in the hospital \u2013 but, his appointment secretary said he had no openings for six months, her father told CNN.  \u201cWherever she turned she could not find help,\u201d he said, adding that his daughter tried a suicide hotline several times: she was once put on hold and once received no answer. Catlin described his daughter as a \u201cstoic, female warrior type person that isn\u2019t going to admit that she\u2019s struggling.\u201d  \u201cShe needed a sports psychiatrist that really could understand what she was going through and understand the rigors of her life in terms of preparation for competitions and the athletic side of it and what it could potentially do to you.\u201d Her father said a major factor in his daughter\u2019s death was \u201ca lack of communication between the facilities that were involved in Kelly\u2019s care. No one was in charge and they assumed the other institutions were following up when they weren\u2019t,\u201d he added. In a statement sent to CNN, Luisa Rapport, director of emergency communications and media relations at Stanford University did not address any of the specific allegations made by Catlin\u2019s family.  She said while the university does not discuss in the media the details of individual students\u2019 experiences, \u201csupporting the mental and emotional health of students is a critical priority for Stanford.\u201d  \u201cStudents in need of mental health crisis assistance \u2013 including students having suicidal thoughts \u2013 and those who are concerned about students in need of assistance, can contact the University\u2019s Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) 24 hours-a-day, seven days-a-week,\u201d she added. Rapport said that in addition to this, \u201cthere are multiple places where psychological services may be provided for students depending on individualized need and treatment recommendations, including, for example, affiliated hospital services and clinics through Stanford\u2019s Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, and mental health programs and clinicians in the community.\u201d In a statement sent to CNN, USA Cycling said it was \u201cdevastated\u201d by Catlin\u2019s death, adding: \u201cShe brought focus and determination to everything she did, and served as an inspiration to everyone who knew her.  \u201cAs the National Governing Body for the sport of cycling, USA Cycling prioritizes the holistic wellbeing of the riders on the U.S. National Team and has a longstanding commitment to providing both physical and mental health resources to members of the team,\u201d a representative for USA Cycling added.   After his daughter Ellie\u2019s death, Soutter was contacted by the UNITE Brain Bank, who wanted to study her brain as part of their research into CTE. But even in that facility \u2013 the biggest of its kind in the world \u2013 of some 1,300 brains, only 3% belonged to women, Ann McKee, Director of the Boston University Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center told CNN. \u201cWhen I actually started looking into CTE \u2013 all of the work that they\u2019ve done with the footballers in America, she had every single symptom and more,\u201d Soutter told CNN. \u201cIt was quite obvious to me that there was a definite link in her starting to get into dark places and feeling bad and anxious and not sleeping properly. All of those symptoms \u2026 Every one that\u2019s involved in CTE was part of Ellie\u2019s life,\u201d he added. \u201cI truly believe today that my daughter would be alive had I had any inkling, you know, even the smallest bit of information.\u201d Editor\u2019s Note: If you are in the US and you or a loved one have contemplated suicide, call The National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255) to connect with a trained counselor.

{"id": "2023_10_30_sport_enhanced-games-olympics-doping-spt-intl", "text": "The 2024 Olympics are fast approaching and as athletes gear up for one of the world\u2019s most prestigious sporting events, one entrepreneur has a different idea of what \u201cfaster, higher, stronger\u201d \u2013 the former motto of the Games \u2013 might represent. The Enhanced Games says it is an \u201calternative\u201d to what it calls the \u201ccorrupt Olympics Games.\u201d Athletes competing at the Enhanced Games will be free to use performance-enhancing drugs, they won\u2019t be tested and will be under no obligation to declare which substances they have taken in order to compete. That\u2019s quite a contrast to the Olympics\u2019 doping protocols. The International Testing Agency (ITA) will be responsible for looking after Paris 2024\u2019s anti-doping program. Six years ago, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which oversees the Olympics, delegated its entire clean sport program to the ITA. However, historically the Olympic Games have been dogged by a series of doping and kickback scandals. When approached for comment on the Enhanced Games and allegations of corruption, the IOC told CNN Sport that \u201cthe idea does not merit any comment.\u201d \u2018Danger to health, to sport\u2019 CNN Sport interviewed a number of experts in the field of doping for this story, who expressed concern that the Enhanced Games was an extremely dangerous proposition. Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, who exposed Russia\u2019s state-sponsored doping program \u2013 a massive, years-long effort which benefited more than 1,000 athletes between 2011 and 2015 \u2013 said that the Enhanced Games is a \u201cdanger to health, to sport.\u201d Whether the Enhanced Games will ever take place remains an open question, but the very idea is drawing considerable blowback from leading anti-doping officials and sporting organizations. The Enhanced Games is the brainchild of businessman Aron D\u2019Souza. He is also the founding editor of \u201cThe Journal Jurisprudence,\u201d a quarterly publication on legal philosophy, according to his website, which also describes him as an \u201cavid athlete.\u201d Recently, D\u2019Souza told CNN Sport he has \u201csigned term sheets with prominent venture capital firms\u201d in relation to the Enhanced Games and is \u201cwaiting on the lawyers to finish long-form drafting.\u201d He also said that a funding announcement is planned for early December. Although not legally binding, term sheets are a serious expression of intent by both sides, setting out the broad principles of an agreement. D\u2019Souza believes what he calls a \u201cscience-driven\u201d competition is the next step in the evolution of sport, suggesting that the absence of drug testing will level the playing field. According to a 2020 study from Raphael Faiss, Research Manager at the centre of Research and Expertise in anti-doping sciences at the University of Lausanne, data from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) suggests less than 2% of athletes dope. However, Faiss told CNN Sport the number of athletes taking performance-enhancing drugs is likely significantly higher; his research, based on two international major athletic events in 2011 and 2013, suggests the figure could be between 15 to 18%. Faiss and his team compared athletes\u2019 blood results collected by WADA-accredited labs to values from healthy adults, as well as doped and undoped athletes; the closer the values are to those of subjects to whom erythropoietin (EPO, which is used in blood doping) had been administered, the higher the chances that they\u2019re actually doping. This analysis, Faiss said, is not proof of doping, but is a \u201crobust way\u201d of analyzing the data, allowing scientists to make an estimate for doping prevalence, as well as targeting athletes most likely to be doping. In written comments to CNN Sport, WADA said: \u201cDetermining the level of [doping] prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed,\u201d explaining that, since 2017, a \u201cprevalence working group\u201d has been established to \u201cdetermine if strategies, reliable methods and tools can be developed to adequately assess the prevalence of doping in sports.\u201d WADA told CNN Sport that the group has delivered \u201cseveral recommendations and guidance to WADA but not the final ones yet.\u201d WADA has reservations about Faiss\u2019 study and pointed to the \u201ccomplexity of trying to measure [doping] prevalence,\u201d highlighting that reports have \u201cgreatly varying results.\u201d The anti-doping organization added: \u201cNo single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline.\u201d \u201cComparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system\u2019s testing figures isn\u2019t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence. \u201cIn any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries \u2013 it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others. \u201cThe Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures.\u201d Editor\u2019s note: You can find WADA\u2019s full statement at the bottom of this article.\u00a0 \u2018A dangerous clown show\u2019 Travis Tygart, the Chief Executive Officer at the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), told CNN Sport that the idea of an Enhanced Games is \u201cfarcical \u2026 likely illegal in many [US] states\u201d and \u201ca dangerous clown show, not real sport.\u201d Substances such as anabolic steroids \u2013 which help to build muscle mass by enabling athletes to train harder and recover quickly from strenuous workouts \u2013 are classified as a Schedule III drug by the US Drug Enforcement Administration. When asked whether anabolic steroids will be allowed at the games and whether athletes would be tested for illegal drugs such as cocaine, D\u2019Souza told CNN Sport that \u201cwe will not be drug testing at the games.\u201d He added: \u201cWe do not propose to regulate what athletes use.\u201d Anabolic steroids may be prescribed by a licensed physician for the treatment of certain conditions such as testosterone deficiency, but if used in the US without a prescription from a licensed physician, a first conviction could result in a one-year prison sentence and a $1,000 fine. But that isn\u2019t the only potential legal jeopardy the Enhanced Games faces, according to American lawyer Jim Walden, who represents Russian whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov. \u201cIf you look at the Enhanced Games website, it\u2019s almost as though they\u2019re advertising their disregard of the law,\u201d Walden told CNN Sport. \u201cThey wrap themselves up in what I will call the cloak of legitimacy by using phrases like body autonomy and coming out as an enhanced athlete. \u201cI hope they\u2019re thinking hard about how they\u2019re going to pull this off in the world in which the FBI has a specific unit that is called the Sports and Gaming Initiative that\u2019s focusing on these very issues.\u201d The Sports and Gaming Initiative was developed to \u201cprotect athletes and sporting institutions in the United States from criminal threats and influences,\u201d according to the government website. The initiative works in partnership with sports leagues and governing bodies, international law enforcement and independent watchdog groups to tackle crimes such as fraud, doping and match-fixing; criminal activities, it says, \u201cdegrade the integrity of sports and competition and erode public confidence in these cherished institutions.\u201d \u201cThe use of doping substances is not acceptable in modern sports,\u201d Rodchenkov said in his written comments to CNN. \u201cPromotion and advertising of banned substances is against sport rules and moral, letter and spirit. \u201cIt might bring an extreme harm to young generation[s] of athletes who mistakenly could believe in benefits of [the] Enhanced Games.\u201d Rodchenkov, the protagonist of the Oscar-winning Netflix documentary Icarus who is currently under FBI protection, also believes that the Enhanced Games\u2019 organizers \u201cmight get investigated [\u2026] under the Rodchenkov Act.\u201d The Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act, named after the whistleblower, allows the US to impose criminal sanctions on individuals involved in doping activities at international events. However, the Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act does not apply to sporting events that don\u2019t adopt the WADA code, which the Enhanced Games wouldn\u2019t do. Rodchenkov also added that WADA athletes could not have any affiliation or contact with so-called enhanced athletes, or they would risk being charged under Article 2.10 \u2013 \u201cProhibited Association by an Athlete or Other Person\u201d \u2013 of the World Anti-Doping Code. USADA\u2019s Tygart also told CNN Sport: \u201cNo one really wants our children growing up idolizing unbridled drug use in sport, even if some profiteers think otherwise.\u201d D\u2019Souza insists his motivation for founding the Enhanced Games isn\u2019t financial. If he had wanted to make more money, he says he\u2019d continue to be a \u201cquiet, mild-mannered venture capitalist.\u201d \u201cI do think fundamentally that consumers want this [the Enhanced Games] and athletes want this because if you go to the cinemas, no one\u2019s interested in histories in the past anymore,\u201d said D\u2019Souza. \u201cThey\u2019re interested in superheroes and technology in the future. And this is literally what we are bringing to a reality.\u201d \u2018The dirtiest Olympics in history\u2019 According to Pierre de Coubertin \u2013 the founder of the modern Olympics \u2013 \u201cfor every man, woman and child, it [sport] offers an opportunity for self-improvement.\u201d Except historically, many athletes competing in the Olympics have taken the idea of self-improvement too far, notably at London 2012, which Rodchenkov has previously called \u201cthe dirtiest Olympics in history.\u201d When the ITA concluded its re-analysis program for the London Games, it found 73 anti-doping rule violations, which led to the withdrawal of 31 medals and reallocation of 46 Olympic medals across the sports of athletics, weightlifting, wrestling and canoeing. Doping has been an issue at the Olympics throughout the event\u2019s history, and the 100-meter final at the 1988 Games has become one of the most infamous and controversial moments in sporting history. Six of the eight finalists \u2013 notably the winner, Ben Johnson \u2013 who lined up on that September day in Seoul 35 years ago would fail drug tests themselves or be implicated in drug use during their careers. Despite some athletes continuing to cheat, global antidoping efforts remain ever-present, according to the testers. Recent out-of-competition (OOC) testing data published by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) highlights positive results from steps being taken to keep \u201celite podiums and finals clean,\u201d according to the anti-doping organization. Data focused on OOC testing ahead of last year\u2019s World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon, shows how resources and testing are targeting those athletes most likely to win medals and make finals. Whilst only 39% of the athletes in Eugene had three or more OOC tests in the 10 months leading up the event, 81% of top-eight finishers had three or more OOC tests. Yet the cat and mouse game between testers and athletes using banned substances continues. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly about the question of timing and targeting the right athletes,\u201d said Faiss. Given that athletes have their blood values regularly monitored, it is \u201cgetting more difficult for athletes to use high doses [of drugs such as EPO], but they would still be using micro dosing.\u201d By taking EPO late at night and drinking enough water, the substance would not be detected in athletes the following morning, according to Faiss, though athletes suspected of blood doping could be tested in the middle of the night. \u201cAthletes are actually getting back to very simple ways of doping with steroids,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cEPO is quite simple to use, but still tricky to detect.\u201d Athletes \u201cuse the drugs that are actively working.\u201d When it comes to new substances such as Roxadustat \u2013 the drug that two-time grand slam champion Simona Halep has recently been given a four-year ban for taking, although she denies ever knowingly or intentionally taking any prohibited substance \u2013 Faiss said athletes \u201care likely to use substances with a very short half-life in [the] body that are mimicking processes of the oxygen carrying improvements through the EPO channels.\u201d Roxadustat has an elimination half-life of 10-16 hours, according to the National Institutes of Health. Athletes are \u201cseeking to find substances where the [half-life] time window is very short, to make sure that if they are not tested at the right moment, they won\u2019t be caught,\u201d said Faiss. \u2018Challenge for sporting competition\u2019 Michele Verroken, the founding director of consultancy group Sporting Integrity, believes an antidoping system is required that will \u201cgive a lot more credibility, a lot more immediacy to verifying results, if we\u2019re going to keep the hearts and minds of athletes.\u201d Verroken also questions what\u2019s stopping an athlete from cheating if they only get caught 10 years after the event, or not at all. Under the World Anti-Doping Code, there is a 10-year statute of limitations on samples taken from 2015 onwards. Verroken told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games is \u201csetting a really interesting challenge for sporting competition.\u201d Not unsurprisingly, many sporting bodies have condemned the event. The Australian Olympic Committee called it \u201cdangerous and irresponsible,\u201d saying that \u201cthe world needs better than this.\u201d UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) said it \u201cis extremely concerned by the concept of an Enhanced Games,\u201d adding that \u201cthere is no place in sport for performance enhancing drugs, nor the Enhanced Games.\u201d UKAD\u2019s Director of Operations, Hamish Coffey, told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games sets a \u201chugely dangerous precedent,\u201d expressing concern over the kind of messaging the event sends to the next generation of athletes. \u2018Very accomplished athletes\u2019 When CNN Sport spoke to D\u2019Souza shortly after the proposed event\u2019s announcement, he said that 368 athletes had enquired about the Enhanced Games and more had messaged via social media. The organization\u2019s Chief Athletes Officer and former Olympian Brett Fraser, who swam for the Cayman Islands at three Olympic Games, told CNN Sport that \u201cvery accomplished athletes\u201d at the level of Olympic finalists have reached out \u201cto understand more about how the first Games will take place and how they can become involved.\u201d Fraser added that Enhanced Games organizers \u201calready have an Olympic medallist\u201d for their athlete commission, though he didn\u2019t specify who that was. He also said there has been \u201ca lot of positive feedback and a lot of acceptance and excitement from younger generations.\u201d Nonetheless, none of the athletes appear prepared to speak publicly at this stage. For those who do want to compete, the Enhanced Games would be an annual event with five categories \u2013 track and field, swimming, weightlifting, gymnastics and martial arts. The huge cost of hosting an Olympic Games is no secret, with countries often striving to create bigger and better spectacles by blowing their budget. Tokyo 2021 had the largest Olympic sports program in history, with 33 sports competitions in 42 venues culminating in 339 medal events. The Covid-impacted Games were delivered with a final expenditure of $13 billion \u2013 almost double the $7.3 billion that was originally forecast. Meanwhile, keeping the IOC\u2019s philosophy of \u201clower-impact Games\u201d in mind, 95% of venues will be pre-existing facilities at the Paris 2024 Olympics. D\u2019Souza said the Enhanced Games will focus on fewer sports, reuse existing infrastructure and fund the event through the private sector to \u201cdeliver a high-impact yet cost-efficient games\u201d so profits can be shared with the athletes. He added that the Enhanced Games is looking for a seven-figure prize pool for any athlete potentially breaking Usain Bolt\u2019s 100-meter world record of 9.58 seconds. \u201cI\u2019ve had conversations with people who are top-10 sprinters in the world who are going to the next Olympics, and they said [\u2026] if there\u2019s a million-dollar prize to break the 100m world record, I\u2019ll be there,\u201d said D\u2019Souza. Universal basic income and mental health support to athletes will also be part of an \u201cenhanced athletes programme.\u201d When asked who would take responsibility if an athlete competing at the Enhanced Games were to suffer fatal consequences, D\u2019Souza told CNN Sport that \u201cour athletes at the games will be the most monitored athletes in history.\u201d He said: \u201cWe will focus on athlete safety by mandating athletes have pre-competition full-system clinical screenings including blood tests and EKGs.\u201d \u201cThis will ensure that athletes are healthy to complete and not at risk of major health complications.\u201d D\u2019Souza also said that athletes will sign waivers in order\u00a0to compete. As it stands, no venues are officially in place to host the event and D\u2019Souza admits its scale will be dependent on funding and media partnerships. \u201cWe\u2019re in commercial negotiations with venues and media partners at the moment,\u201d added D\u2019Souza, who said the first Enhanced Games will be at a university campus or a similar facility in the south of the US and that a number of trademarks have been filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. \u2018Undermine the very purpose of sport\u2019 Elite performance coach Trevor Painter, who has worked with a number of Olympic and international sprinters and middle-distance runners, said he would \u201cnever\u201d coach an athlete taking performance-enhancing drugs because it would go against his morals as a coach. \u201cHaving been involved with many athletes that have lost in many ways to the cheats, I won\u2019t be engaging with [the Enhanced Games],\u201d Painter told CNN Sport. If it goes ahead as planned in December 2024, D\u2019Souza insists that the Enhanced Games will unlock the potential of humanity. But according to John William Devine, Senior Lecturer in Ethics, Sport and Exercise Sciences at Swansea University in Wales, the Enhanced Games will make sporting competition more unfair than it already is and even \u201cundermine the very purpose of the sport in question.\u201d Devine told CNN Sport that \u201cperformance-enhancing drugs don\u2019t actually lead to better athletic performance. They obscure athletic performance.\u201d He added that, although the Enhanced Games may look very similar to the Olympics, the nature of the activity will be different, raising the question: \u201cTo what extent is drug-assisted performance reflective of the athletes\u2019 sporting excellence?\u201d WADA response in full: Determining the level of prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed. That is why we set up a\u00a0Working Group on Doping Prevalence\u00a0in 2017. Measuring doping prevalence is a difficult and complex process. Through its work, the group found a huge variance across the many prevalence studies that have been carried out, leading it to publish guidelines on how to improve the quality of measuring prevalence. WADA is currently developing a tool that Anti-Doping Organizations can use to evaluate the effectiveness of their programs. WADA is well aware of the [Faiss] study. Indeed, one of the contributors, Prof. Martial Saugy, is a member of the Working Group. This study is one of many that helps to inform the Group\u2019s work. It is a very narrow study. It looks at two events, in a single sport, held 10 and 12 years ago, using just one method of measurement (the Athlete Biological Passport (ABP)). As far as I am aware, there is no comparable data from more recent World Championships in the same sport. Given its limited scope, it is important that this study be analyzed within the wider context of other studies and not be taken in isolation. This study also highlights the complexity of trying to measure prevalence. It is the third published paper that sought to measure prevalence at the 2011 Athletics World Championships. Each reported greatly varying results. The fact is no single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline. Results will always come with caveats and margins of error and will be based on a variety of methods, including self-report questionnaires, analytical methods (like ABP and testing data) and other methods to give a more rounded estimate of what the most likely figure would be. Comparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system\u2019s testing figures isn\u2019t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence. In any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries \u2013 it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others. The Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/10/30/sport/enhanced-games-olympics-doping-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}

The Sele\u00e7\u00e3o dominated the group stage match with 73% possession and took a total of 19 shots, but failed to find the breakthrough at SoFi Stadium, California. Costa Rica goalkeeper Patrick Sequeira was kept on high alert throughout the match but Brazil failed to hit the target on 12 occasions when presented with a chance to score. At one point, the television cameras cut to Brazilian superstar Neymar in the crowd, who looked exasperated following another missed opportunity from his side. The forward is still recovering from a serious knee injury and will miss the entire tournament. Brazil, though, did have the ball in the back of the net in the first half but Marquinhos\u2019s header was ruled out after the video assistant referee (VAR) spotted an offside in the buildup. Lucas Paquet\u00e1 arguably came closest to finding the breakthrough after the midfielder struck the post with a brilliant second half strike \u2013 the 26-year-old was also guilty of spurning more than one chance when it seemed easier to score. \u201cWe played our game, we have to improve our finishing, myself in particular, so that we can win,\u201d Paquet\u00e1 said after the game, per BBC Sport. Meanwhile, Costa Rica failed to register a single shot on target as it sat back for the majority of the match. Somewhat surprisingly, Brazil\u2019s talisman Vin\u00edcius Junior was kept reasonably quiet throughout the match, unable to inspire his side to victory like he has done so many times at club level for Real Madrid. The Ballon d\u2019Or contender was eventually substituted in the second half, a decision that Neymar seemed puzzled by in the stands. The injured star looked on in disbelief with his arms outstretched as Vin\u00edcius Jr. walked off the field. Brazil finding its feet Despite its history of being one of the greatest soccer nations in the world, the current Brazil squad is still finding its feet after a complicated transitional period. The team recently suffered back-to-back World Cup qualifier set-backs for the first time in its history, before going on to lose a third. That third defeat \u2013 a 1-0 loss to Argentina at the Maracan\u00e3 - was historic, too, marking the first time Brazil had ever lost a home World Cup qualifier. Interim coach Fernando Diniz was sacked in January, less than halfway through his one-year deal, and replaced by journeyman manager Dorival J\u00fanior, who oversaw narrow wins against England and Mexico and draws against the USA and Spain before this year\u2019s Copa Am\u00e9rica. But despite the team\u2019s recent struggles, the pressure and expectation is still high back home, considering the level of attacking quality. Brazil will have the chance to kickstart its tournament against Paraguay in its next Group D match, before facing a sterner test against Colombia.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/sport/brazil-costa-rica-neymar-copa-america-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}

But, I left my family to be the coach at Texas A&M. I took the job at Texas A&M to never take another job again,\u201d Schlossnagle said in response to a reporter\u2019s question about rumors that he was considering taking the job at the University of Texas, A&M\u2019s hated rival. \u201cAnd that hasn\u2019t changed in my mind, and that\u2019s unfair to talk about something like that. \u2026 I understand you gotta ask the question, but I gave up a big part of my life to come take this job and I\u2019ve poured every ounce of my soul in this job, and I\u2019ve given this job every single ounce I could possibly give it. So, write that.\u201d Less than 24 hours later, Schlossnagle was a Texas Longhorn. It\u2019s a stunning turnaround that has infuriated Aggies, whose athletic teams will finally be back in regular competition with Texas once the Longhorns join the Southeastern Conference later on this year. The two schools have long been intrastate rivals and the rivalry runs deep \u2013 A&M\u2019s unofficial fight song, \u201cThe Aggie War Hymn,\u201d was penned by a graduate who wanted to express his hatred of the University of Texas while he sat in a trench in France during World War I. Schlossnagle\u2019s about-face came so quickly that his social media presents quite the sight: Posts celebrating the Aggies\u2019 performance in the College World Series  sit right below photo illustrations of the coach clad in Texas\u2019 burnt orange and white. A&M athletic director Trev Alberts said in a statement that Schlossnagle gave word of his decision to leave for Texas shortly after the team arrived back in College Station, Texas, after being defeated by the University of Tennessee in Omaha, Nebraska. That arrival was just hours after Schlossnagle\u2019s terse answer over his future at Texas A&M, where he had coached for three years. \u201cAfter our baseball team arrived back in College Station earlier today, Jim informed me of his desire to leave Texas A&M,\u201d Alberts said. \u201cWhile we are certainly disappointed, we are grateful for his contributions in helping our baseball program reach unprecedented heights. Baseball success is important to everyone associated with Texas A&M, we will not stop in our pursuit of excellence and our commitment to baseball will not waiver.\u201d For his part, Schlossnagle acknowledged he was likely to anger the Aggie fanbase. \u201cAlthough I know many will be upset with my decision, I chose to make a change to join a longtime friend to continue my career as a college baseball coach,\u201d he said in a statement released through Texas A&M. \u201cThe run to the National Championship game was truly a remarkable one this year, and I will savor the memories and true friendships I have made there for a lifetime.\u201d In his introductory press conference in Austin, Texas, on Wednesday, Schlossnagle thanked A&M for his time at the school and apologized for not being able to explain his decision to his team before departing. He also apologized to the reporter who he called selfish in Monday\u2019s press conference. \u201cHe\u2019s a young reporter. He asked a question that was an obvious question,\u201d Schlossnagle said. \u201cI wish I could have answered that better. But in the moment, all 30 minutes after the last pitch, all I could think about was our players. And I really wasn\u2019t in the mood to talk about myself for the future.\u201d He added that the tense moment at Monday\u2019s press conference was genuine, because at the moment he truly did feel that way. But he cited his relationship with Texas athletic director Chris Del Conte \u2013 whom he worked with extensively at Texas Christian University \u2013  and the opportunity at Texas as ultimately leading him to make his decision on Tuesday. \u201cI get it, I get it. All I can say is, I have a career too,\u201d Schlossnagle said when asked about upset Aggies fans. \u201cI have a personal life as well. I have goals and I simply felt like \u2013 no negative at A&M, just the positives of the alignment (at Texas) and my relationship with Chris.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/sport/jim-schlossnagle-texas-baseball/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_sport_euro-2024-portugal-georgia-czech-republic-turkey-spt-intl", "text": "Georgia caused the biggest upset of Euro 2024 so far with a sensational 2-0 win over Portugal to book its place in the round of 16. Khvicha Kvaratskhelia gave Georgia the lead inside two minutes after an awful error in the Portuguese defense, before Georges Mikautadze scored the second from the penalty spot in the second half. Competing at the first major tournament in the nation\u2019s history, Georgia has captured the hearts of fans at Euro 2024 for its fearlessness and high-intensity football. Both were on display again in Wednesday\u2019s deserved victory as Georgia eventually saw out the win with relative ease, qualifying for the knockout stages as one of the tournament\u2019s four best third-place teams. Elsewhere, Turkey\u2019s 2-1 win against Czech Republic means the team finishes second in Group F behind Portugal. Portugal had already qualified for the knockout stages with wins over Czech Republic and Turkey and was looking to become just the second team after Spain to win all three group games at Euro 2024. Georgia, meanwhile, knew only a win would be enough to reach the round of 16. The lowest-ranked team at Euro 2024, Georgia had proven to be no pushover in its games so far during the tournament, losing narrowly against Turkey and drawing with Czech Republic. Given the team had already qualified, perhaps a lack of focus and intensity led to Portugal gifting Georgia the opening goal less than two minutes into the game. An awful back pass by Antonio Silva gave the ball straight to Mikautadze, whose through ball found Kvaratskhelia inside the box and the Napoli forward finished brilliantly across Diogo Costa. So loud was the roar that went up inside the Arena AufSchalke in Gelsenkirchen that it might have been heard back in Tbilisi. Portugal dominated possession for the rest of first half but was limited to long shots by a diligent Georgia defense. Goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili was equal to them all, keeping out efforts from an increasingly frustrated Ronaldo and Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix. Ronaldo let his annoyance get the better of him after claiming he should have been awarded a penalty for having his shirt pulled, resulting in yellow card for dissent. For all of Portugal\u2019s dominance, Georgia should have doubled its lead after 35 minutes but Giorgi Gvelesiani couldn\u2019t make contact with his header after rising highest to try and get on the end of Kvaratskhelia\u2019s free kick. Kvaratskhelia then had a glorious opportunity to get Georgia\u2019s second just minutes into the second half after more poor defending from Portugal, but scuffed his shot from just 10 yards out. Georgia, however, was not to be denied its second goal. After a long wait for a break in play \u2013 that only came when Mamardashvili sensationally tipped Diogo Dalot\u2019s long-range strike behind for a corner \u2013 VAR ruled that Otar Kiteishvili had been fouled inside the penalty area in an earlier passage of play. Mikautadze stepped up and calmly side-footed the ball into the bottom corner to send thousands of Georgia fans inside the Arena AufSchalke wild for a second time this evening. That was Mikautadze\u2019s third goal of the tournament, making him the top scorer at Euro 2024. Georgia was far from just hanging on to its lead in the second half and was good value for its two-goal advantage, comfortably holding Portugal at arm\u2019s length. Of the two teams, Georgia looked the most likely to get the next goal and was a constant threat on the counterattack. Nelson Semedo had the best chance of the half for Portugal, but the indomitable Mamardashvili got down sharply again to preserve the clean sheet. When the referee blew for full time, the Georgian bench emptied onto the pitch and the players celebrated in front of their fans as though they had won the entire tournament. Ranked 74th in the world and a nation of less than four million people, this was the greatest night of football in the country\u2019s history.

{"id": "2024_06_25_sport_michael-phelps-congress-doping", "text": "Legendary Olympian Michael Phelps on Tuesday ripped the World Anti-Doping Agency and described an inconsistent application of anti-doping rules that is driving frustration among clean athletes and concerns over the future of fair competition. In testimony before the House Energy and Commerce\u2019s Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation, Phelps and fellow former Olympic swimmer Allison Schmitt described the lengths they went to in order to prove they were competing fairly. But those rules are not being applied equally, they said, pointing specifically at Russia and China as among the nations whose athletes are allowed to skirt strict anti-doping measures. \u201cWe need to hold them responsible,\u201d Phelps said of WADA, adding that the agency should \u201calmost be on a separate island by themselves\u201d in terms of how the world\u2019s leading anti-doping authority should be treated. The hearing focused on an investigation over alleged doping by almost two dozen Chinese swimmers that is playing out ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympics. The Chinese swimmers tested positive for trimetazidine, a banned performance-enhancing substance, several months before the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, where they went on to win medals, according to a report from The New York Times released in coordination with German public broadcaster ARD. Phelps argued WADA\u2019s handling of the case \u2013 which is under an independent review \u2013 showed the agency\u2019s reforms have \u201cfallen short.\u201d He asked Congress \u201cto use its considerable leverage with WADA to make the organization independent and effective.\u201d \u201cIt can\u2019t reasonably be a coincidence that (WADA) has yet again succumbed to the pressures of international sport,\u201d Phelps said. \u201cClose friends were potentially impacted by (WADA\u2019s) failure to follow its own rules in investigating the nearly two dozen positive tests on Chinese swimmers. Many of them will live with the \u2018what ifs\u2019 for the rest of their lives. \u201cAs athletes, our faith can no longer be blindly placed in the World Anti-Doping Agency, an organization that continues to proves that it is either incapable or unwilling to enforce its policies consistently around the world.\u201d The athletes described inconsistencies in WADA\u2019s testing and the application of anti-doping rules across nations and competitions. Both Phelps and Schmitt said the process was worth signing up for \u2013 including being required to urinate in front of anti-doping officials to prove the sample they were giving was their own \u2013 because it would ensure clean competition. But that pressure to comply with the rules wasn\u2019t applied equally, the athletes said. Phelps said in one year he was tested 150 times for performance-enhancing drugs, while other Olympic delegations were tested only 30 or 40 times across all their athletes. \u201cIf I can control myself and be the best version of myself, that should be enough. And I think people are doing that now and people are cheating, and that needs to change,\u201d Phelps said. \u201cSo, I think that\u2019s why we\u2019re here today, to fight for that change for the next generation.\u201d WADA under the microscope over China tests The hearing is the latest action from lawmakers, who have called for the Department of Justice and the International Olympic Committee to investigate how WADA and the Chinese Anti-Doping Agency handled the positive tests. US Anti-Doping Agency CEO Travis Tygart also testified. Tygart has accused WADA and CHINADA of covering up the positive tests, which occurred seven months before the Tokyo Games in 2021, and of leaving other athletes in the dark. CHINADA has said the 23 athletes tested positive for an \u201cextremely low concentration\u201d of trimetazidine at a national swimming competition in 2021. Trimetazidine has the potential to boost endurance and has been banned by WADA since 2014. The agency decided the swimmers were not responsible for the results because they were inadvertently exposed to the drug. WADA was notified of the positive tests in June 2021, roughly a month before the Tokyo Games kicked off. In a news conference earlier this year, WADA President Witold Ba\u0144ka said the agency \u201cfollowed all due processes and diligently investigated every lead and line of enquiry in this matter\u201d and found \u201cno evidence of wrongdoing \u2026 and no credible way to disprove the contamination theory that was accepted by CHINADA.\u201d WADA has launched an independent review into its handling of the tests, and Ba\u0144ka was invited to testify at the Tuesday hearing as well. He declined to testify, according to a committee spokesperson. CHINADA has argued media reports about the situations are misleading. In a statement, WADA acknowledged the hearing and said it decided against sending a representative because \u201cthe relevant organizations with responsibility for the anti-doping during the Olympic Games were not invited to the hearing.\u201d The statement alleged that the hearing was more about geopolitics than it was about doping and that it was not appropriate for WADA to wade into the fray. Ba\u0144ka said the hearing pushed out misinformation regarding the alleged Chinese doping scandal and denied showing bias toward China. \u201cWADA understands the tense relationship that exists between the governments of China and U.S. and has no mandate to be part of that,\u201d Ba\u0144ka said. \u201cIt is not appropriate for anti-doping to be politicized in this way. All it does is weaken confidence in the system, which ultimately does not benefit athletes from the U.S. or anywhere else. WADA always endeavors to protect clean sport and treat athletes fairly, regardless of where in the world they are from.\u201d Lawmakers float withholding US taxpayer money from WADA Lawmakers at the hearing \u2013 including the chairman of the subcommittee, Republican Rep. Morgan Griffith of Virginia \u2013 raised the prospect of withholding US taxpayer funding from WADA if things don\u2019t improve. The US provides about $4 million annually to the agency, Griffith said. \u201cTheir refusal to appear today calls into question their commitment to accountability. If they\u2019re not going to do the job, we shouldn\u2019t even fund them,\u201d he said. Tygart slammed WADA\u2019s handling of the case and China\u2019s influence on the agency. He said 11 of the 23 swimmers who tested positive in 2021 are going to compete in next month\u2019s Games in Paris. Tygart said he\u2019s concerned about a cozy relationship between WADA and the Chinese government, including that WADA decided to close an investigation into allegations of \u201csystemic doping in China.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the fox guarding the henhouse. When you have sport leaders who have an interest in the decision that they\u2019re making, that can\u2019t be an independent decision,\u201d he said. The top Democrat on the subcommittee, Rep. Kathy Castor of Florida, said Banka\u2019s refusal to appear at the hearing left critical questions unanswered. \u201cWhy did WADA accept CHINADA\u2019s conclusions? Why did WADA keep the violations secret? Why were Chinese athletes treated differently than athletes from other countries? Why were the Chinese swimmers not provisionally suspended? \u2026 Did reported payments from the (People\u2019s Republic of China) to WADA influence WADA\u2019s decision-making?\u201d she asked. \u201cThese unanswered questions are why I\u2019m especially disappointed that WADA refused the committee\u2019s invitation to testify today.\u201d Tygart wants Congress to condition US funding for WADA on the group setting up an independent committee of experts that will make rulings on positive tests that don\u2019t result in a rule violation, alleging that those decisions are made in secret. He also wants an audit of WADA to assess how it is complying with its own rules and responsibilities. Frustration and disappointment among athletes with WADA Schmitt was candid about what it meant to her to lose to a Chinese relay team that would later come under suspicion. \u201cWe raced hard. We followed every protocol and accepted our defeat with grace. Three years later, news surfaced that some Chinese athletes on that team were not subjected to the same anti-doping rules, casting doubt on the fairness of the competition. With these revelations, many of us will be haunted by this podium finish that may have been impacted by doping,\u201d she said. She also detailed the effects the scandal has had on athletes preparing for next month\u2019s Games, saying, \u201cAs recently as last week at the US swimming Olympic trials, I witnessed the frustration and disappointment of young athletes whose confidence in the anti-doping system has been shattered. They deserve better. They deserve a level playing field where success is determined by talent, hard work and dedication \u2013 not by banned substances.\u201d Phelps told the lawmakers that the process is more proof that WADA does not enforce its rules equally across nations. He expressed disappointment that he is once again testifying to Congress about WADA\u2019s shortcomings, having appeared in front of the same committee in 2017. \u201cSitting here once again, it is clear to me that any attempts of reform at WADA have fallen short, and there are still deeply rooted systemic problems that prove detrimental to the integrity of international sports and athletes right to fair competition, time and time again,\u201d Phelps said.

On Monday, Zhang came off the bench for her international debut and scored 19 points on 9-for-9 shooting in just 13 minutes, helping China brush aside Indonesia 109-50. She also racked up seven rebounds, two assists, two steals and three blocks. The International Basketball Federation (FIBA) subsequently released a video of her game highlights, showing the youngster towering over opponents and barely needing to jump to dunk the ball. Given her height advantage, she looked devastating in defense while demonstrating her shooting accuracy from distance. The footage has since gone viral on social media. \u201cZhang Ziyu is a cheat code,\u201d a social media user said on X, formerly known as Twitter. After Monday\u2019s breakthrough game, Zhang is showing no signs of slowing down. Earlier on Tuesday, the center totaled 36 points on 80% shooting along with 13 rebounds and four blocks as she inspired China past New Zealand 90-68 to maintain its perfect start to the tournament. China next plays on Wednesday against Japan, with the teenager set to star once again. FIBA lists Zhang as 7-foot-3 on its official website, meaning she is only one inch shorter than San Antonio Spurs star Victor Wembanyama. Given her height and nationality, social media users have already compared her to NBA legend Yao Ming, who was just three inches taller. While Zhang has a long way to go before matching Yao\u2019s career, her performances this week will surely pique the interest of teams across the WNBA.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/sport/zhang-ziyu-basketball-star-china-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_sport_ukraine-russia-olympics-iryna-kolyadenko-intl-spt", "text": "As she hits the mats in a large, bright gym in a recreational area near Kyiv, the ongoing war with Russia is very much on Ukrainian wrestler Iryna Kolyadenko\u2019s mind. Amid thousands of\u00a0civilian casualties and as the war grinds on, Ukrainians like Kolyadenko competing at the Paris Olympics face an existential challenge as much as an athletic one. The 25-year-old is no stranger to the physical demands of training but for the first Olympics since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the one-time bronze medal winner is upping her mental game in anticipation of squaring off against Russian athletes. \u201cI consider it my mission to prevent them from getting on the podium,\u201d Kolyadenko told CNN. \u201cIf I show my emotions, demonstrate them, it will prevent me from winning \u2026 but, of course, there will be no handshakes,\u201d she said. Russians and Belarusians will be participating in the games as Individual Neutral Athletes and that means Ukrainian athletes could end up facing off against them. Ukraine\u2019s sports ministry has issued guidelines for their athletes competing at the upcoming Games in Paris including refraining from joint photos, press conferences, and events with Russian and Belarusian athletes, not commenting on social media, keeping a distance from them during award ceremonies, and much more. Acting Sports Minister Matviy Bidnyi told CNN that the reason for the recommendations was several incidents that have already occurred at competitions of various levels ahead of the Olympics, including the refusal to shake hands with a Russian athlete at the world championships, which resulted in disqualification for fencer Olga Kharlan. According to the Ukrainian Ministry of Sport, discussions were held with international federations in various sports over its athletes not wanting to shake hands with Russian and Belarusian athletes at the Paris Olympics. As a result, the international federations decided that Ukrainian athletes wouldn\u2019t be disqualified for not shaking hands with individual neutral athletes. For Kolyadenko, shaking hands with Russian and Belarusian athletes is a no-go. \u201cThe Russian military destroyed my apartment, the Russian military is destroying my life, the lives of my family and the whole country, how can I treat them? Of course, negatively. I don\u2019t want Russians to take part in the competition at all. This is unacceptable,\u201d she said. When Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Kolyadenko was at the gym in Kyiv where she now is training for the Paris Games. \u201cThat day, we were supposed to fly to Turkey for a competition, but at 4 a.m. we woke up hearing explosions. Of course, I was totally confused and didn\u2019t know what to do. \u201cBut then I gathered my thoughts, packed my things and went to Irpin \u2026 At that time, I did not understand what had happened,\u201d adds Kolyadenko as she recalled traveling to Dymtrivka village to be with her grandmother, aunt and sister. Three days later, she says, dozens of Russian military vehicles entered Irpin. Residential areas were shelled, and civilians were killed. The village where Kolyadenko and her family were staying, was under constant shelling. The family moved to the basement. One day, when Kolyadenko went upstairs to get her stuff, she says, the wrestler saw through her window there were Russian troops rappelling down a ladder from a helicopter. Running out of food, and with no water or gas, and no medicines being delivered and little prospect of evacuation, Kolyadenko and her relatives left the village \u201cIt was already very dangerous,\u201d said Kolyadenko. \u201cOn the roadsides there were shot up cars where people had been killed.\u201d Kolyadenko spent more than a day driving with her family and relatives. She says she didn\u2019t think about sports or training at all, because she didn\u2019t know if they would survive. \u2018We had no choice.. because our families were there\u2019 Kolyadenko was not the only one to experience such a life-threatening situation. The head coach of the women\u2019s wrestling team, Volodymyr Evonov, also encountered Russian troops at the base near Kyiv. Almost immediately, he left for his family in Kherson, even though there was already information that convoys of Russian heavy vehicles were heading towards the city from annexed Crimea. \u201cWe traveled to meet the war. We had no choice. On the way, we saw our military digging trenches. They told us not to go there. We went anyway. Because our families were there,\u201d Evonov told CNN as he recalled those first days of invasion. A week later, the Russians entered Kherson. Local residents resisted them, took to the streets with posters and flags to stop Russian tanks, and organized pro-Ukrainian rallies in the city\u2019s central square until repression began against the activists. The athletes had their own form of protest \u2013 they continued to train. \u201cWe trained regularly and waited for our military to release us,\u201d added Evonov. \u201cA month passed in this expectation. It was getting harder and harder. We got together with our coaches, took some of the athletes and our families and in mid-April (2022) we took advantage of the window of opportunity and managed to leave.\u201d After Evonov and his colleagues left their hometown, Kherson remained under occupation until the city was liberated in 2023, though it remains under constant shelling. It is no longer possible to continue training there, according to Evonov. Just a month after the war began, the women\u2019s national wrestling team was able to gather for a joint training session at the Olympic center of the Hungarian team in Tata. The Ukraine women\u2019s team was then invited to live and train in a safe environment by their Japanese colleagues, where they spent a fortnight in June 2023. The Ukraine women\u2019s team also spent another two months in the US, where they were hosted by local universities. These days, the women have returned to regular training at their base near Kyiv. They have endured blackouts caused by Russian targeting of electricity infrastructure and spent sleepless nights as missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles hit the city. While Kyiv is much better protected these days the war shows no sign of ending. Difficult training conditions The conditions under which the athletes have prepared for the Paris Olympics affected the team\u2019s results. At the Tokyo Olympics, the women\u2019s wrestling team won five licenses. This year, only two athletes \u2013 Kolyadenko and Oksana Livach \u2013 will go to Paris. According to Bidnyi, more than 100 athletes will represent the Ukrainian national team in Paris. Given the conditions in which they have been preparing for the Olympics over the past two years, the Ministry of Sports of Ukraine says this number of athletes competing is quite positive given that there is a war going on. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that during the aggression, when, for example, Russia caused a blackout last winter, it was very difficult to train,\u201d said Bidnyi. \u201cThe temperature in the halls sometimes dropped so much that we had to train in our outerwear. Another example is that our synchronized swimmers train in a pool in Kharkiv, which actually has a hole in the roof because a missile hit it. It is clear that these are not the conditions that can be called normal,\u201d added Bidnyi. Over 500 sports infrastructure facilities have been destroyed since the full-scale invasion, according to Bidnyi. These are the ones located on the territory controlled by Ukraine. There is no verified information about the destroyed infrastructure facilities in the occupied part. \u201cThere are athletes whose loved ones and parents are at constant risk,\u201d said Bidnyi. \u201cSomeone\u2019s relatives are serving on the frontline today, and the athletes are worried about them. \u201cSome of our athletes have lost their parents, who lived a peaceful life until a missile hit their home. There are a lot of such stories. Some lost their homes, some lost their loved ones,\u201d adds Bidnyi. For Kolyadenko, getting a license and preparing for the Paris Olympics was more difficult than for any other competition in her career. Given the uncertainty in Ukraine, she says she cannot plan her professional life after the Olympics. For now, here only goal is do her country proud.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/sport/ukraine-russia-olympics-iryna-kolyadenko-intl-spt/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_sport_kathleen-noble-rowing-uganda-paris-olympics-spt-intl", "text": "From learning how to row in boats patched together with duct tape to competing at the world championships in a different sport entirely, Kathleen Noble\u2019s rise to the apex of rowing has certainly been unconventional. Her journey now sees the 29-year-old set to become a two-time Olympian \u2013 Noble represented Uganda at the Tokyo Games \u2013 when she competes at Paris 2024. She is Uganda\u2019s first Olympic rowing participant, as well as the African nation\u2019s first and only White Olympian across any sporting discipline. A prodigious swimmer in her youth, Noble represented Uganda at the 2012 World Swimming Championships at just 17 years of age. Then, on a whim during her time as a student at Princeton University, Noble was convinced to try her hand at rowing. \u201cWhen I took my first steps into the sport, I had no thoughts or intentions of competing at a high level and certainly couldn\u2019t have imagined that this would be the direction that things would go,\u201d Noble tells CNN Sport. \u201cTo be honest, it is still a bit surreal to be competing on a stage like this. I don\u2019t think it was until they actually told me that Uganda wanted to send me to the Olympic qualifiers that I really thought, \u2018Oh, okay, maybe there\u2019s something here.\u2019\u201d Equipment issues The sport of rowing is still very much in its nascent stages across many parts of Africa, including Uganda. It was properly introduced to the country back in 2009 when the World Rowing Federation sent out a shipment of donated boats to help to grow a sport which carries with it significant financial entry barriers. It was on these boats that Noble learned to row skull (individual), as opposed to her time rowing crew (as a team in one boat) at university. Whilst the thought of training on Lake Victoria, one of Africa\u2019s Great Lakes and the world\u2019s largest tropical lake, may bring with it a sense of charm and serenity, trying to prepare to compete at Olympic level just isn\u2019t feasible given the lack of opportunities and investment afforded to rowing within Uganda, a reality which sees Noble now train out of Tennessee under former US rower James Martinez. \u201cThere is no history of rowing in Uganda. I mean, I\u2019m literally the first person, male or female, to even qualify for the Olympics,\u201d Noble says. \u201cIt is still extremely niche, and the community is very small. I probably know every single rower in the country personally. \u201cBack in 2016, I took eight months off from university to row in Uganda and I\u2019m so grateful that I did because I got to experience first-hand all the struggles that rowers back home go through on a daily basis. \u201cNot only is there a lack of competition and adequate coaching, but there is a lack of most basic essentials, such as having properly functioning equipment. \u201cWhen I was rowing on Lake Victoria, we were still using the boats donated back in 2009. We would be duct-taping them and trying to get people to patch them up with fiberglass for us.\u201d It is not just a lack of equipment which has hampered rowing\u2019s growth in the east African country. Governance is also a major issue, and the absence of proper oversight has seen many athletes leave the sport in recent times, according to Noble, due to \u201cpromises being made but not always being kept.\u201d The only way the sport has a chance to progress is through the help and funding from outside donors such as the World Rowing Federation. Muhumuza Rodrick Chandi,\u00a0the technical director of the Uganda\u00a0Rowing Federation, tells CNN Sport that the price of equipment and a lack of coaches has been an issue in the country. \u201cIt is true that there is a lack of coaches as most qualified ones have left Uganda in search of greener pastures,\u201d he says.\u00a0\u201cRowing, like most sports in Uganda, is voluntary, so once these coaches get better opportunities they migrate or leave the sport altogether. \u201cThe Ugandan Rowing Federation does suffer from a lack of funding, mainly because it doesn\u2019t get much budgetary support from the National Council of Sports as it\u2019s considered a small sport.\u201d \u2018Honor\u2019 representing Uganda Born in Nakaseke, central Uganda, in 1994, Noble is the daughter of Irish missionaries. \u201cUganda was a fantastic place to grow up in many ways, whether it be the great weather all year round or the friendly and cheerful nature of the people,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut as a White, blonde child, I maybe would have had an aversion to going out in public due to the amount of attention I\u2019d have gotten.\u201d Despite her differences, of which Noble is acutely aware, sport has allowed her to form a deeper connection with her birthplace. \u201cEven though I have Ugandan citizenship, there is an identity to being Ugandan which is about coming from one of the local tribes and having land and a history and ancestors going back a long way,\u201d she says. \u201cI respect that, but at the same time, I did grow up in Uganda. It\u2019s a place that is important to me and it does mean a lot to me to have people accept me as being Ugandan. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge honor to represent my country. It\u2019s been the way that I\u2019ve felt the most connection to my identity as a Ugandan. Growing up there, when people ask you where you\u2019re from, I would say Ireland, even though I was born and grew up there. \u201cBut I feel like as I\u2019ve gotten deeper into representing and rowing for the country, I have felt more strongly that I am Ugandan.\u201d Noble\u2019s acceptance by Ugandan sports fans has also been a great source of encouragement. While she says that she will occasionally receive the odd message on social media criticizing her for representing the country, the overwhelming majority of both fan and media messaging has been support and pride for raising the profile of Ugandan rowing. \u201cYou\u2019re always going to have haters and people who want to try to knock you down, that\u2019s kind of to be expected in high level sport nowadays with social media \u2026 but I find it extremely touching that whenever I am met with negativity, a barrage of positivity will follow,\u201d says Noble. \u201cI\u2019m very, very grateful for that.\u201d Platform for change Noble, on top of her sporting ambitions, works as a software engineer in Tennessee and, alongside her husband, is a homesteader with a small-scale farm producing food and animals for themselves. Like every athlete, she hopes that her Olympic journey will culminate atop the podium, but she does also head to Paris with a compelling sense of realism. \u201cRowing is not really a sport where you wake up and just have a great day and row faster than you ever have before,\u201d says Noble. \u201cIt is a little bit more deterministic than that. Sports that are really based around cardiovascular strength tend to remove that element of major surprise around results. I\u2019m not going to flat out say that my goal isn\u2019t to medal, but at the same time I need to be realistic.\u201d Winning a medal is not the only means by which you can determine an Olympian\u2019s success, though, with Noble hoping that her exposure during the Games can help to elevate rowing back in Uganda, ensuring that she is no longer its sole representative. \u201cI feel a sense of responsibility to try and help support athletes back home,\u201d she says. \u201cWhether that correlates to me having to do well, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily true. I get a lot of press whether I come first or last. \u201cI believe that the actual position that I come is less important than the spotlight that exists around the Olympics. That gives me the platform to raise awareness about the limitations and struggles that athletes have in Uganda to a global audience.\u201d Rowing, particularly singles rowing, can be a very isolating sport, a fact that Noble can attest to. But come July 26 when the Paris Games get underway, she will have the backing of an entire nation eager to witness what will, no matter the end result, be more Olympic history for Uganda.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/sport/kathleen-noble-rowing-uganda-paris-olympics-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_sport_diede-de-groot-tennis-unstoppable-force-spt-intl", "text": "It\u2019s one thing to beat the best. It is, however, an entirely different proposition to be the best. To evolve from the hunter and become the hunted \u2013 and not just over the course of a week, month, or perhaps even years. Moreover, to do so over a prolonged period, set against the backdrop of ever-changing competitors, landscapes and the sands of time and physiology. Wheelchair\u00a0tennis player Diede de Groot, though, has been unequivocally the dominant constant in the face of those challenges. \u2018Diede the Great\u2019 \u201cI feel a very big target on my back which is what keeps me motivated,\u201d De Groot told CNN ahead of the French Open. \u201cI know all of these girls are working towards beating me which is fun but intense at the same time. \u201cThey\u2019re not playing with any pressure when they\u2019re playing against me and I have all the pressure because there\u2019s this massive streak that\u2019s following me everywhere. \u201cAt the same time, I really try to forget about all of that and just play tennis.\u201d In a world where we\u2019re inundated daily with statistics ranging from the intriguing to the inane, De Groot\u2019s numbers make for truly remarkable reading. She is the first tennis player \u2013 wheelchair or able-bodied \u2013 ever to win three successive calendar grand slams. She is the first women\u2019s wheelchair tennis player to achieve the Golden Slam \u2013 all four grand slams and a Paralympic gold medal \u2013 in 2021. De Groot is also unbeaten in grand slam tournaments since the 2021 Australian Open, currently boasting a winning streak that has surpassed 130 matches. Based on facts and figures alone, one would be hard pushed to begrudge the 27-year-old for possessing the bold \u2013 yet prophetic and linguistically apt \u2013 social media handle of @DiedetheGreat. \u201cI was too humble to say Diede the Great,\u201d she says smiling. \u201cMy own last name Groot was already taken, so I had to come up with something else and then the literal translation of Groot is great. So that\u2019s how it sort of came to be. \u201cDuring the year, maybe I don\u2019t think about it [records] enough \u2026 especially in tennis because it\u2019s just like a continuous streak of tournaments. It\u2019s difficult to really take time. \u201cBut when I\u2019m just at home sitting, thinking of the amazing things that I\u2019ve already done to this point, I\u2019m very proud of myself.\u201d Wall of Champions So what\u2019s the secret of the Dutch star\u2019s success? \u201cI don\u2019t think I have the biggest serve. I don\u2019t think I have the biggest forehand,\u201d De Groot reflected. \u201cI just think that I\u2019m very good at all of the levels \u2026 I\u2019m a complete player. \u201cI don\u2019t really have a weak point and that\u2019s very difficult for opponents to, to play against.\u201d De Groot\u2019s current grand slam singles tally stands at 21. Her latest victory at this year\u2019s Australian Open was not only a remarkable 13th in a row but it also drew her level alongside the great Esther Vergeer\u2019s grand slam tally. Vergeer\u2019s 21st and final major title came at Roland Garros in 2012. Whilst De Groot still has some way to go to encroach on her compatriots astonishing 470-match unbeaten winning streak, it\u2019s fitting then that she\u2019ll have the chance to become the most successful women\u2019s wheelchair tennis player of all time at this year\u2019s French Open. Victory in Paris would consolidate De Groot\u2019s position as third in the all-time list of overall grand slam champions across singles and doubles. The 27-year-old\u2019s current tally stands at 39. Vergeer finished her career with 42 titles, second only to Japan\u2019s recently retired Shingo Kunieda, the most decorated men\u2019s player in the history of wheelchair tennis, who amassed an astonishing 50 majors. Hotbed of talent Aside from her technical prowess, the foundations of De Groot\u2019s trophy-laden career \u2013 and for that matter her compatriot Vergeer\u2019s \u2013 can also be attributed to the Dutch tennis system. It\u2019s one which allows wheelchair tennis to integrate with able-bodied players, a strategy that has worked to stunning effect. \u201cI started wheelchair tennis when I was seven years old \u2026 I had a few operations done on my hip [and] the rehabilitation center advised me: \u2018Hey, would you like tennis?\u2019 I picked it up, and I loved it straight away,\u201d said De Groot, who was born with unequal leg length. \u201cTo have that feeling that I could play tennis just like all the other kids in the group \u2026 it was very special to have that. \u201cWe are fully integrated into the KNLTB [Royal Dutch Lawn Tennis Association] program. We are treated like athletes [and] being taken seriously really helps taking yourself seriously.\u201d The KNLT\u2019s National Tennis Centre, located in Amstelveen, boasts 14 outdoor and 14 indoor courts with accessibility for wheelchair tennis. \u201cTwenty years ago wheelchair tennis was one of the biggest Paralympic sports in the Netherlands,\u201d says De Groot. \u201cWe already were very lucky to have a very good number one gold medalist [Vergeer] and because we were such a small country, we could all see each other play. \u201cAnd just learning from previous generations \u2026 I could learn from the women that went before me. I could see it from up close and therefore mimic it or even try to do better.\u201d De Groot and Vergeer both herald from the historic Dutch city of Woerden, which has produced a conveyor belt of some of the greatest players from The Netherlands to have ever graced the sport. So is there something special in the Woerden waters. \u201cWe lived very close to each other which is actually quite special,\u201d De Groot says. \u201cAnother world number one \u2013 Jiske Griffioen \u2013 also comes from there. So, it\u2019s just a coincidence \u2026 but it\u2019s a funny coincidence!\u201d \u2018We are being noticed\u2019 Wheelchair tennis events are now gradually being incorporated into a growing number of ATP and WTA events. The prestigious Miami Open hosted an event for the very first time earlier this year and Wimbledon has announced it will double the size of the wheelchair draws for this summer\u2019s tournament. \u201cI would say that from history, Paralympics were always the moment that all eyes were on us,\u201d reflected De Groot. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have to share it with able-bodied athletes. \u201cBut then for another four years, we would sort of fall to the background again \u2026 now I really feel like these players are noticing us. They\u2019re recognizing us and interacting with us more and more. \u201cI saw Jannik Sinner play with our world No. 1 Alfie Hewitt [in Miami]. Novak \u2026 he\u2019s done some really good promotion with Dylan Alcott before so hopefully these moments will be more and more \u201cCountries are developing their programs and players are developing their games. It\u2019s a really fun time to be a wheelchair tennis player.\u201d Paris 2024 When it came to the Covid-impacted Tokyo Games, the Dutch star had an unprecedented weight of history of her shoulders. Dutch women have won every wheelchair tennis title \u2013 singles and doubles \u2013 since it became a medal event 32 years ago. De Groot stormed to singles and doubles gold without dropping a set in either competition. It remains one of the defining moments of her career. \u201cFor a long time, a lot of people ask me that without gold, your career wouldn\u2019t be complete. I never thought about it that way. \u201cWinning gold in Tokyo really felt like it was like a completion of so many years already that I\u2019ve been doing so well. So many things came from winning those medals that it definitely sparked something around me, which is very good.\u201d The Dutch phenom is on track to return to the clay courts of Roland Garros to defend her titles this summer at Paris 2024. It\u2019s a challenge she\u2019s relishing and with her imperious track record to date in the French capital \u2013 winning a total of nine grand slam titles \u2013 you\u2019d be a brave person to bet against her. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a different Paralympics,\u201d she says. \u201c[I] played in Rio. I was very new there. [I] Played in Tokyo. No one was allowed to come and watch and I had all the pressure there. And now I\u2019m a defending champion with everyone there. \u201cIt will mean everything [to defend the titles]. It\u2019s the goal that I\u2019m aiming at. \u201cI still have many tournaments before so my head is not yet there, but it will be and I\u2019m going to enjoy it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/sport/diede-de-groot-tennis-unstoppable-force-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_sport_lakers-coach-jj-redick-first-news-conference", "text": "Former longtime NBA shooting guard JJ Redick, who has no prior coaching experience in the league, was introduced Monday as the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 next coach. Redick, who celebrated his 40th birthday Monday, replaces Darvin Ham, who was fired in May after two seasons with the Lakers. \u201cI have zero coaching experience in the NBA, but I would argue that I\u2019m very experienced and it started 22 years ago when I went to Duke and I got to play for Coach K (Mike Krzyzewski) for four years, spent 15 years as a (NBA) player,\u201d he said. Redick said the past three years \u2013 in which he\u2019s worked as a podcaster and ESPN analyst \u2013 have been invaluable in his preparation. \u201cBeing able to connect with the players, talking to them on the podcast, being in coaching interviews with ESPN calling games, analyzing the game in three different formats. All of that has helped prepare me to be an NBA head coach,\u201d he said Redick played 15 seasons in the league for six teams before becoming an NBA analyst for ESPN in 2021. Asked by a reporter whether he had heard any misconceptions or concerns about himself in recent weeks during the hiring process that he felt the need to dispel, Redick was blunt. \u201cIt\u2019s a valid question, and I\u2019ve certainly heard everything. \u2026 However, I don\u2019t really have a great answer for your question because I really don\u2019t give a f**k. Like honestly,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to coach the Lakers. I want to coach the team. I don\u2019t want to dispel anything\u2026 I want to become a great coach in the NBA.\u201d The man who hired Redick said he was always on their A-list. \u201cIt was very evident that he had a unique perspective and philosophy on basketball and how it\u2019s to be taught,\u201d Lakers Vice President of Basketball Operations and General Manager Rob Pelinka said at the news conference. Pelinka said he and Redick share \u201ca basketball philosophy that was very similar and it was based on high level strategy, it was based on a certain way of communicating with players and teaching them,\u201d as well as \u201cprioritizing player development.\u201d Redick indicated he\u2019d like to see Lakers star forward and the NBA\u2019s all-time leading scorer LeBron James take more threes after shooting better than 40% this season, but he still needs to have a conversation with James. \u201cYou have to certainly get buy-in and talk to him about how he wants to play,\u201d Redick said. \u201cIt\u2019s really just figuring out in the half court, putting him in different spots both as a scorer and a facillitator.\u201d Redick co-hosts a basketball podcast with James. But it\u2019s unclear whether he will get to coach James, who in five days has the choice of exercising a contract option or moving on\u00a0next season. James\u00a0has not directly addressed his future with the team nor whether he would return for his 22nd NBA season. On April 30,\u00a0James\u00a0posted on X, \u201cI\u2019ve seen, heard a lot of reports about my future. I said it last night and I\u2019ll say it again. I do not know yet as I\u2019m only thinking about spending time with my family & friends! \u201cWhen I know after speaking with the fam, my counsel as well as my representation about it then you guys will know.\u201d Redick said he sees nine-time all-star center Anthony Davis as a \u201chub\u201d of the team next season so the Lakers can maximize his abilities. He said he spoke to Davis about a week ago about ideas he has for Davis\u2019 roles on offense and defense. \u201cI think both of us felt really comfortable going forward with that sort of as the base starting point of how he\u2019s gonna play on this team,\u201d Redick said. This isn\u2019t the first time the Lakers have hired someone with no coaching experience to guide the team: With the team struggling in 1994, owner Jerry Buss put Magic Johnson is charge for the final 16 games, and he posted a 5-11 record before resigning and becoming a part-owner. Earlier this month, University of Connecticut men\u2019s basketball head coach Dan Hurley spurned the Lakers for their then-vacant head coaching job to stay and chase a third-straight national title with the Huskies. The Lakers had offered the coach of the defending back-to-back NCAA champion Huskies a six-year, $70 million contract, according to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski. Redick said he had no issues with the Lakers\u2019 pursuit of Hurley. \u201cAt no point was my ego or feelings hurt or bruised in any way,\u201d he said. \u201cDan Hurley is a two-time national champion at UConn. I am a two-time 55 Swiss league champion in the 3rd and 4th grade division \u2013 like, I understood.\u201d Last season, Los Angeles was eliminated from the playoffs in five games, losing to the then-reigning champion Denver Nuggets for the second straight postseason. The Lakers currently hold the 17th selection in Thursday\u2019s 2024 NBA Draft.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/sport/lakers-coach-jj-redick-first-news-conference/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Score and Georgia would qualify for Euro 2024; miss and it might be yet another story of heartbreak for this generation of fans to live through. As the midfielder started his run-up, assistant coach David Webb held his breath, tightly huddled together with the rest of the team. The entire nation watched as Kvekveskiri stuttered on his approach to the ball, before releasing a shot into the bottom left corner. \u201cYou could feel a pin drop in the stadium and then, when he put it in the bottom corner, it erupted,\u201d Georgia\u2019s assistant coach Webb tells CNN Sport, recalling the moment the nation qualified for Euro 2024 with a penalty shootout win against Greece \u2013 the first major tournament it has ever reached. \u201cStaff were crying. Players were crying. Fans bombarded the pitch. It was quite emotional.\u201d The winning spot-kick sparked jubilant scenes \ufeffinside Tbilisi\u2019s Boris Paichadze Dinamo Arena, as fans flooded onto the pitch and players celebrated in the dressing room. Webb smiles as he remembers those chaotic scenes of unbridled joy back in late March, laughing as he tries to recall which songs the players sang as they partied through the night. The excitement spread up and down the football-mad country and the anticipation has continued building ahead of the tournament\u2019s start in Germany on June 14. For Webb, it was a moment that he will never forget, and the \u201csurreal\u201d outcome has continued to provide memories that will last a lifetime \u2013 he\u2019s even in the process of getting an honorary Georgian passport. Helping Georgia qualify for Euro 2024 is the latest highlight in Webb\u2019s unique coaching career, a journey which has taken some unlikely twists and turns over the years. Watching football on a \u2018chess board\u2019 After realizing he wasn\u2019t quite good enough to forge a career as a top-flight player, Englishman Webb quickly made his name as a coach, impressing in a number of different roles \u2013 including youth coach and recruiter \u2013 at a host of professional English clubs. It was always the psychological side of the game that fascinated Webb most, an ability that enabled him to spot a player\u2019s potential where others could not. \u201cAnyone can pick the best players,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me, it was always about scratching under the surface a little bit. What makes [players] tick, what makes them develop.\u201d Webb is different from many other coaches in the world of football. He is softly spoken, unassuming and doesn\u2019t come with the usual bravado which is prevalent in a sport full of egos. Rather than looking purely at tactics and statistics \u2013 elements that are still important to his philosophy \u2013 he is more interested in fostering healthy relationships and creating environments for players to flourish. It\u2019s an approach rooted in his ability to empathize with people and something he credits to being slightly neurodiverse as a child. \u201cI had a sort of feeling and affiliation towards people and I always found football quite easy to watch,\u201d Webb says. \u201cI was watching games like a chess board, like a helicopter over the game. It was sort of a feeling and intuition with people. I kind of found I was getting a lot of this right over the years, especially when it comes to football and spotting talent.\u201d Webb decided to enhance this natural ability and obtained a postgraduate degree in sport psychology. Understanding the \u201chumanistic\u201d side of football, he says, is something that gives him an extra edge in his coaching career. Then, when a frustrating spell as manager of non-league club York City ended in disappointment in 2023, Webb got the chance to prove himself on the biggest stage. As chance would have it, Webb had briefly met former France international Willy Sagnol while on scouting duties in France in 2014. The pair hit it off and kept in contact over the years, with Sagnol impressed with the different way in which Webb sees the game. After Sagnol was appointed manager of the Georgian men\u2019s national team in 2021 and, after Webb found himself at a loose end, he was offered the chance to become one of the team\u2019s assistant coaches. Emotional Euro 2024 campaign It was an opportunity Webb couldn\u2019t turn down, a chance to work with an exciting generation who had their hearts set on qualification to Euro 2024. His remit was broad, tasked not only with helping to coach the players but also strengthening them mentally. He first set up one-to-one interviews with all the players to learn more about their personal journeys and to understand what they needed to maximize their potential. He says some players became emotional during these informal chats, thankful for the opportunity to speak about their lives in a sport where people are often treated as numbers, rather than humans. Webb then continued his work on the training field, looking for players who possessed character traits that would enable the team to do something it had never done before: reach a major tournament. Webb says he was surprised by what he saw in those early sessions, as he started to learn more about the culture of the country he was starting to represent. \u201cIt was just quite unique. All the players are the same, whether they\u2019re the biggest stars, they\u2019re all the same, the staff are all the same,\u201d he adds. \u201cThey\u2019re very humble, all of them, very passionate, very sensitive as well. Quite emotional but such pride for their country. I\u2019d never seen that before.\u201d After getting to know the players better, Webb continued to work on the mental aspect of their game, something which may have been a secret weapon in the penalty shootout win against Greece. In training before the play-off campaign, which saw the team beat Luxembourg in the semifinals before knocking out 2004 Euro champion Greece, Webb says the team specifically practiced the walk up to the penalty spot. The infamous few seconds in football can either make or break a player, and Webb believes the more you practice it, the easier it will be. Before the play-off games, Webb also delivered a presentation about focus to the entire squad, something which drew inspiration from elite athletes in other sports, as well as the national team\u2019s own journey. \u201cIt was good to deliver that,\u201d Webb says. \u201cYou could see the players\u2019 faces, a few tears were around. \u201cYou could feel that it was locked in, you know, that everything was calm, pure focus. Training was good. The players were ready.\u201d Now qualified for the tournament in Germany, Georgia is ready to continue surprising people when competition gets underway. The team boasts a selection of real talent, led by the likes of Napoli winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia. Despite being an underdog in the tournament, Webb is confident this team can compete in its group alongside Turkey, Portugal and Czech Republic. \u201cWe\u2019re not there just to be tourists,\u201d he says, leaning on similar comments made by Sagnol earlier in the year. \u201cWe want to go and compete and give our best. We think we\u2019ve got a fighting chance within the group to maybe progress to the next round. We\u2019re not going in there just to take part. \u201cWe looked at our squad, we looked at the other squads and we think, you know, we can be seriously competitive here.\u201d Georgia\u2019s first game will come against Turkey on June 18. On a personal note, though, Webb can scarcely believe the direction his life and career have taken after that chance encounter with Sagnol all those years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s quite surreal,\u201d Webb says, eyes full of excitement at the prospect of coaching Georgia at the pinnacle of European football.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/sport/euro-2024-georgia-underdogs-coach-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Or if you\u2019re Amy Yang, try 75 times to win your first major \u2013 ending an almost two-decades wait \u2013 after the South Korean golfer survived a late scare to win the Women\u2019s PGA Championship in Washington on Sunday. Seven shots clear with just three holes to play at Sahalee Country Club, alarm bells rang when Yang bogeyed and double bogeyed the subsequent two holes, but the 34-year-old righted the ship with a closing par to finish three stokes clear of compatriot Ko Jin-young and American Lilia Vu at seven-under par overall. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible,\u201d Yang, who carded a final round even-par 72, told reporters. \u201cI was so nervous at the beginning of the day, even the night before. \u201cI told Jan [Meierling, caddie] on the 18th fairway, this has been the longest 18 holes I\u2019ve ever played in my career.\u201d Despite five wins on the LPGA Tour, victory on the biggest stage had eluded Yang for 18 years. In 74 prior major starts, she had finished inside the top-10 on 21 outings, and twice as a runner-up at the US Women\u2019s Open in 2012 and 2015. With 17 of those top-10 finishes coming between 2009 and 2017, Yang\u2019s best window of opportunity looked to have passed, yet the world No. 25 mastered a star-studded field and a demanding course to become the LPGA Tour\u2019s oldest major winner since Angela Stanford claimed the 2018 Evian Championship at 40-years-old. Stanford is the sole player to have waited longer for their first major than Yang, and only just: the American triumphed on her 76th attempt. \u201cAt one point I thought, \u2018Will I ever win a major championship before I retire?\u2019\u201d Yang said. \u201cI finally did it and it\u2019s just amazing.\u201d Victory secured Yang $1.56 million in prize money and stamped her ticket to the Paris Olympics next month. It will mark her second appearance at the Games, having finished tied-fourth in Rio in 2016. \u201cThat was one of my biggest goals for this year,\u201d Yang said. \u201cMissing cuts past few tournaments and I saw my world ranking went down so I wasn\u2019t sure if this winning was enough to make the team. But I made it, so I\u2019m very grateful for that.\u201d Korda tumbles It was another tough weekend for world No. 1 Nelly Korda, who carded the worst round of her professional career to tumble from within touching distance of the lead to missing the cut for the third tournament in a row. Already chasing her seventh win of the season, the American made a stellar start with an opening three-under 69, just one stroke shy of early leader and compatriot Lexi Thompson. Yet the 25-year-old nosedived during Friday\u2019s second round, carding eight bogeys and a double bogey en route to a nine-over 81. It marked the highest score of her eight-year pro career and resigned her to a third consecutive missed cut after failing to make the weekend at the Meijer LPGA Classic and last month\u2019s US Women\u2019s Open, the latter of which included a septuple-bogey. \u201cNo words for how I\u2019m playing right now,\u201d Korda, who won the first major of the season at the Chevron Championship in April, told reporters. \u201cI\u2019m just going to go home and try to reset \u2026 A lot went my way at the beginning part of the year, and just giving it back.\u201d The major calendar continues with The Evian Championship in France on July 11, before concluding with the Women\u2019s British Open at St. Andrews in Scotland on August 22.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/sport/amy-yang-womens-pga-championship-win-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Some might head out to the driving range, others may listen to music or discuss strategy with their caddie. Faced with an unprecedented level of stress, Nick Bienz took a more commonplace approach to stress relief: he headed to the bar. Three beers and eight nerve-wracking holes later, the 27-year-old stamped his ticket to his first ever PGA Tour event. The Golf Galaxy employee will not be available to work this week, after he secured his place in the field at Thursday\u2019s Rocket Mortgage Classic with a terrific \u2013 and slightly tipsy \u2013 qualifying performance on Monday. Hoagland, Indiana, native Bienz had faced an anxious wait to discover his fate after five birdies and an eagle had sent him back to the clubhouse atop the leaderboard with a bogey-free seven-under 65. With multiple groups still finishing their rounds at The Orchards Golf Club in Washington, Michigan, the Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) alumni headed to the bar to summon some Dutch courage. While nursing his second beer, he was joined at the table by Ryan French \u2013 or, as he is better known on social media, Monday Q Info \u2013 who has amassed 170,000 followers in his coverage of those hopefuls grinding away on golf\u2019s developmental tours and qualifying events. \u201cI need every ounce of alcohol right now to calm the nervous system and not try to vomit on myself,\u201d Bienz told French in a video shared on X, formerly known as Twitter. \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019re at right now.\u201d It was uncharted territory for Bienz, who explained to French that he works at Golf Galaxy \u2013 a golf equipment and apparel retailer with stores across the US \u2013 to help fund his professional career, arriving early or staying late to take advantage of the shop\u2019s in-house practice facilities. The biggest event he had played to date was a state open, according to French. He had attempted to qualify for events before, including several on the Korn Ferry Tour \u2013 the PGA Tour\u2019s developmental circuit \u2013 but had never been so close to getting over the line. Having previously packed a week\u2019s worth of clothes in anticipation of making it through, Bienz \u2013 chasing any way to change his luck \u2013 had only brought enough for Monday. \u201cI think I play better when I don\u2019t have any expectations, to the point where I didn\u2019t even bring any clothes beyond today,\u201d Bienz told the PGA Tour. \u201cI had to go buy underwear and socks last night because I ran out of those.\u201d \u2018I have to call my boss\u2019 Bienz and four others headed into the playoff in a straight shootout for the final two spots. A nail-biting war of attrition ensued, with Bienz driving brilliantly to keep himself among the three players that headed to the eighth playoff hole. Having almost holed out with his approach, Bienz tapped in from a few feet away to clinch his place in a field that will fight for its share of a $9.2 million prize purse \u2013 not that he can recall the moment itself. \u201cI don\u2019t remember hitting the putt,\u201d Bienz added to the PGA Tour. \u201cI know that sounds really crazy, but I don\u2019t remember hitting the putt on 18 in regulation either to make birdie. Once it hit, I was like, \u2018This is surreal.\u2019\u201d Once he has figured out what he is going to wear at Detroit Golf Club on Thursday, Bienz will turn his focus to taking on some of the PGA Tour\u2019s biggest names, including South Korea\u2019s rising star Tom Kim, who was narrowly beaten by rampant world No.1 Scottie Scheffler in a playoff at last week\u2019s Travelers Championship. \u201cNo matter what happens \u2013 if I shoot 80-80 the first round and I miss the cut \u2013 at least I can hold my head up high and say, \u2018You finally did it, you finally got into one,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid to say it\u2019s all gravy because, obviously, if you want to play professionally, you can\u2019t just get to the PGA Tour, you have to play well on the PGA Tour.\u201d Then there is the prospect of viral fame to wrestle with, with French\u2019s coverage of Bienz\u2019s heroics capturing the imagination of fans and players alike. \u201cPair him with me,\u201d four-time PGA Tour champion Kevin Kisner \u2013 also in action Thursday \u2013 demanded of the PGA Tour in a post on X, while a Venmo link for Bienz shared by French has drawn in a flurry of payments, including $500 from Ohio-based Garage Beer. \u201cI Facetimed my fianc\u00e9e in the cart on the way back and she was sobbing, couldn\u2019t get words out \u2026 The first thing she said to me she was like, \u2018You\u2019re famous,\u201d Bienz added to the PGA Tour. \u201c\u2019I was like, \u2018What does that even mean, it\u2019s a Monday qualifier?\u2019 She couldn\u2019t get many words out, but she was like, \u2018I\u2019m proud of you.\u2019\u201d Before he left the course, Bienz reconvened with French for a final debrief. \u201cI have to call my boss and call off work tomorrow for sure,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be there 7:30 in the morning and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/sport/nick-bienz-pga-tour-beer-qualifier-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_sport_alex-morgan-womens-soccer-paris-olympics", "text": "US women\u2019s soccer legend Alex Morgan will not be on the team\u2019s roster for the Olympic Games next month in Paris, a symbol of the changing of the guard going on inside the women\u2019s national team. Head coach Emma Hayes, who is embarking on her first major tournament in charge of the squad, named her roster for the 2024 Paris Olympics on Wednesday. The 22-player roster, which includes 18 players going to Paris and four alternates, includes only eight players from the 2020 Olympics, which were held in 2021 in Tokyo, and 10 members of the 2023 World Cup team. Morgan\u2019s exclusion from the roster is indicative of change coming to a team that has been hugely successful over the last several seasons with an incredibly accomplished core of players. But that generation had found itself being outpaced in recent tournaments by other nations, finishing in third place in the Tokyo Games and being bounced from the 2023 World Cup on penalties in the round of 16. Hayes, brought in after that World Cup disappointment, is facing the task of bringing the next generation of American women to fulfill the expectations of success that follow the women\u2019s national team. Morgan expressed disappointment at the selection but said she\u2019ll be supporting the team next month. \u201cToday, I\u2019m disappointed about not having the opportunity to represent our country on the Olympic stage. This will always be a tournament that is close to my heart and I take immense pride any time I put on the crest,\u201d she said in a post on X. \u201cIn less than a month, I look forward to supporting this team and cheering them on alongside the rest of our country.\u201d Hayes in a news conference praised Morgan\u2019s contributions to the national team and her storied career but said it was time for the squad to go in another direction. She acknowledged the roster for Paris will have less experienced players than previous tournaments with an eye toward development. \u201cThere\u2019s no rite of passage for any team in the world to just win an Olympic gold medal and there\u2019s no denying the history of this program has been hugely successful. But the realities are it\u2019s going to take a lot of work to get to that top level again,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cI think looking through the cap accumulation of the team, there\u2019s been a lack of development of putting players \u2013 some of the less experienced players \u2013 in positions where they can develop that experience. And I think it\u2019s important that we have to do that to take the next step. \u201cI\u2019m not looking backwards, we have to look forward with a group of players that have put that World Cup behind them. And we\u2019re very much looking forward to sort of building on the work, you know, post-the World Cup. For us, this is an opportunity to show those learnings will take us much further than it did last time, but there is no guarantee in anything in life.\u201d The roster is made up of goalkeepers Casey Murphy and Alyssa Naeher; defenders Tierna Davidson, Emily Fox, Naomi Girma, Casey Krueger, Jenna Nighswonger and Emily Sonnett; midfielders Korbin Albert, Sam Coffey, Lindsey Horan, Rose Lavelle and Catarina Macario; and forwards Crystal Dunn, Trinity Rodman, Jaedyn Shaw, Sophia Smith and Mallory Swanson. The four alternates are goalkeeper Jane Campbell, midfielders Hal Hershfelt and Croix Bethune and forward Lynn Williams. \u201cIt\u2019s a balanced roster. I\u2019ve considered all the factors that we\u2019re gonna need throughout the Olympics and (it\u2019s) one that I\u2019m really happy with,\u201d Hayes said. Part of Hayes\u2019 consideration for the roster was durability and adaptability. Many of the players selected can play multiple positions, which will be key given the relatively short turnaround between matches in France. \u201cThe biggest factor is the 16 outfield players to play a lot of games \u2013 arguably, I hope \u2013 over a 17-day period,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving a roster that could adapt is essential. You have a tight turnaround between games so, of course, having players on the roster who can play more than one position mattered with squad depth.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/sport/alex-morgan-womens-soccer-paris-olympics/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Mbapp\u00e9 might have said no to the offer in July, but a month later, Neymar Jr. said yes to Al-Hilal, as the Brazil star moved from PSG for a transfer fee of around $98.5 million (\u20ac90 million) plus add-ons, according to multiple reports. In a record-breaking transfer window, Saudi Pro League (SPL) clubs spent close to $1 billion, acquiring 94 overseas players from Europe\u2019s major leagues \u2013 France\u2019s Ligue 1, Spain\u2019s La Liga, Italy\u2019s Serie A, Germany\u2019s Bundesliga and the English Premier League \u2013 according to Deloitte. Despite the Arab nation\u2019s poor human rights record, Saudi Arabia\u2019s spending spree to turn its domestic soccer league into a star-studded, bona fide competition shows the seriousness of its ambition. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman says he doesn\u2019t \u201ccare\u201d about the country\u2019s investment in sport being described as sportswashing. \u201cWell if sportswashing is going to increase my GDP by one percent, then I will continue doing sportswashing,\u201d MBS said in an\u00a0interview\u00a0with Fox News which aired Wednesday. Pressed on if he was bothered by the use of the term, MBS continued: \u201cI don\u2019t care. I have one percent GDP growth from sport, and I am aiming for another one and a half percent. Call it whatever you want, we\u2019re going to get that one and a half percent.\u201d Saudi clubs, several of which have been taken over by the nation\u2019s sovereign Public Investment Fund (PIF), have already attracted some of the biggest names in the sport. By attracting some of the world\u2019s biggest stars to the Gulf states, the SPL wants \u201cto drive competitiveness on and off the pitch,\u201d though it\u2019s keen to emphasize that these overseas players will help develop \u201cyoung Saudi talent.\u201d During this summer transfer window, the government-controlled PIF increased the cumulative value of these four clubs nearly five times, making them the most valuable in the country, according to estimates by the sports website Transfermarkt. Plenty of other leading stars have eagerly said yes to the SPL, notably 2022 Ballon D\u2019Or winner Karim Benzema joining Al-Ittihad at the end of his contract with Spanish soccer giant Real Madrid. As the European transfer window came to a close, the four PIF-owned teams have spent nearly $900 million (\u20ac835.1 million) on buying elite international players, Transfermarkt data shows, which ranked them in the top 20 clubs in the world by transfer expenditure, alongside soccer giants from England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy. Al Hilal alone paid more than $378 million (\u20ac353 million), more than PSG and Arsenal, making it the second-largest spender this year. The newly acquired players join five-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, who has a two-year contract with Al-Nassr where he will earn a staggering estimated $200 million a year, according to Saudi state-owned media, currently making him the world\u2019s highest paid soccer player. As of today, 21 of the most expensive soccer players in Saudi Arabia by transfer fees \u2013 all international stars \u2013 play for one of the PIF-owned clubs. Despite the financial outlay, the SPL is remaining deliberately tight-lipped about the specifics of its financial gamble, with chief operating officer Carlo Nohra confirming to CNN Sport that it was \u201cnot in [the SPL\u2019s] competitive advantage\u201d to report the salaries offered to players and coaches. The PIF has $777 billion in assets under management, according to its most recent filing, with ambitions to top $1 trillion within a few years. In 2021, it acquired English soccer club Newcastle United, before focusing on investments at home. The club is now also among top spenders on players. Saudi clubs not owned by the PIF are also splurging on big-ticket players, with former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson, 33, offered an eye-watering salary of $870,000 (\u00a3700,000) per week, according to multiple reports, in an estimated $15 million (\u00a312 million) transfer from Liverpool to Saudi team Al-Ettifaq. In a recent interview with The Athletic, Henderson said those numbers \u201cjust aren\u2019t true.\u201d \u201cEssentially, the signal is \u2018We mean business,\u2019\u201d Simon Chadwick, a professor of sport and geopolitical economy at SKEMA Business School, told CNN.\u201cWe\u2019ve got so much money that for a player who is \u2026 coming towards the end of his career, we can afford to pay him 700,000 [GB pounds a week], or whatever it is that he\u2019s being paid, and still have Cristiano Ronaldo and still be in the market for other players as well,\u201d Chadwick said, describing Saudi\u2019s approach to becoming a sporting superpower, adding that the sky is the limit in terms of cost. Saudi\u2019s love of soccer Saudi Arabia follows in the footsteps of several other countries \u2013 including China and Qatar in investing large sums of money to try and turn themselves into soccer powerhouses. It remains to be seen whether Saudi\u2019s turbocharged investment will have a lasting impact or resemble something like a costly rebranding effort. The Saudi national team has been to multiple World Cups, and the country\u2019s clubs have won multiple Asian titles. Saudi\u2019s victory over Argentina during last year\u2019s men\u2019s World Cup was hailed as one of the greatest upsets in tournament history, with the country\u2019s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud granting a national public holiday in recognition of the win. Club games can attract huge crowds in the Middle Eastern nation. \u201cFor example, Al-Ittihad against Al-Hilal, you\u2019re talking about drawing crowds of 40, 50, 60,000 people, these are games that are comparable in size to Chelsea vs. Arsenal, Manchester United vs. Manchester City,\u201d Chadwick said. Buying star players, some arguably past their prime, also provides an easy win for Saudi teams, according to Kieran Maguire, co-host of \u201cThe Price of Football\u201d podcast. \u201cFrom the Saudi authorities\u2019 point of view, they\u2019re getting a ready-made product. Everybody\u2019s heard of Benzema. Everybody\u2019s heard of Cristiano Ronaldo and so on,\u201d Maguire said. Saudi Arabia\u2019s lofty sporting ambitions don\u2019t end with the SPL or Newcastle United. The country is hosting the 2023 FIFA Club World Cup and is bidding to host the 2027 AFC Asian Cup. Several media reports also indicated that the Gulf kingdom was considering launching a bid for the 2030 FIFA men\u2019s World Cup alongside Greece and Egypt \u2013 although it is reportedly mulling pulling its candidacy. Meanwhile, the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) has agreed to a contract that will see the Spanish Super Cup played in Saudi Arabia until 2029, a deal that will earn the Spanish governing body between \u20ac35-45 million ($38-48 million) a year. Appealing to the youth Saudi Arabia has a very young population: the country\u2019s most recent census revealed 32.2 million people live in the country, nearly 42% of whom are foreign nationals \u2013 and 51% of the Saudi population are under the age of 30.\u202fOf this populace, Saudi authorities say that over 80% play, attend or follow soccer, the national sport. Chadwick explains that Saudi Arabia\u2019s government is concerned with the prospect of its younger members of society becoming radicalized or an anti-government sentiment bubbling up like that of the Arab Spring \u2013 and looks to offer its population a thriving soccer industry to keep it placated. Though the soccer industry generates employment, revenues, export earnings and inward investment, \u201cwhat is just as significant is the security of the royal family,\u201d Chadwick adds. The Arab Spring, a wave of pro-democracy protests that washed over the Middle East and North Africa in 2011, achieved mixed results. Four Arab dictators in Libya, Yemen, Egypt and Tunisia were toppled, offering a brief sense of victory for protesters, but, since then, new wars have prompted a retreat of popular movements in the region. Meanwhile, failed uprisings in Bahrain and eastern Saudi Arabia were followed by years-long crackdowns and a continuing civil war in Syria. \u201cWhat we\u2019re beginning to see in Saudi Arabia right now is the emergence of a new social contract. And the social contract essentially is catering for the needs of the Gen Z population,\u201d Chadwick said. \u201cYou want Ronaldo? You got him. You want some of the best football teams in the world? You got them. You want the World Cup to come to Saudi Arabia? You got it \u2026 But don\u2019t question us,\u201d Chadwick explained. Maguire agrees, noting that investing in soccer \u201ccan be seen as part of a much broader socio-economic plan, run by the Saudi authorities.\u201d At the same time, there has been \u201ca significant increase in the number of Saudi Arabians detained by the authorities, for example, for posting adverse comments on social media about the country\u201d this year, Chadwick told CNN. Human rights group Amnesty International told CNN that it has documented a rollback in human rights in Saudi Arabia, including an escalating crackdown on freedom of expression and an increased use of counterterrorism and cybercrime laws to silence dissent. Between 2022 and 2023, the organization said it has documented an increase in criminal prosecutions compared to previous years. In 2022, Amnesty reported the highest number of annual executions in the country in 30 years, with 196 people killed. \u201cReputation is important in terms of attracting foreign investment, and \u2026 Mohammed bin Salman, as much as he has significant financial muscle, needs foreign investing for the realization of his diversification,\u201d James Dorsey, the author of the syndicated column and blog, \u201cThe Turbulent World of Middle East Soccer,\u201d explains. Saudi Arabia is the world\u2019s biggest exporter of crude oil, and nearly two-thirds of its income still comes from selling fossil fuels. But with oil prices regularly dipping below what the Gulf state needs to balance its budget, it has focused efforts on trying to bring in investment from abroad along with its efforts to raise oil prices. Projections indicate the kingdom has around 20 years to diversify its economy to ensure it is more resilient, according to Chadwick \u2013 not least to fund its Vision 2030 projects, including the $500 billion Neom city, a 106 mile-long linear city called The Line and a futuristic plan to revamp the capital. \u201cPart of the grand vision of Mohammed bin Salman, looking forward to 2030, he does have his desire to make Saudi Arabia less dependent on natural resources to look at a post-fuel economy [involving] tourism, entertainment. If Saudi Arabia can become a hub for major sporting events, then that\u2019s a way of attracting interest to the country,\u201d said Maguire. CNN has reached out to the Saudi Ministry of Sport for comment on allegations that the kingdom has been rolling back human rights, and investing in soccer as a way of \u201csportswashing\u201d its image. In response to previous criticism about Saudi Arabia\u2019s purported \u201csportswashing,\u201d the kingdom\u2019s sports minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal said: \u201cPeople that don\u2019t know Saudi Arabia, have never been to Saudi Arabia, go out and talk about it as if they\u2019ve lived there for 30 years, 40 years. So I always tell people, come to Saudi. Come and see Saudi. \u201cSee what it is, see the people, meet the people. Look at what the country is doing for the future of the people in Saudi, then you can criticize as much as you like,\u201d he added. Lack of transparency: Saudi threatens new systems of governance\u202fin sports Saudi Arabia has already disrupted the golf industry and, with soccer, Maguire told CNN, \u201cthey feel that they can do that probably on a smaller scale, but perhaps, ultimately, to generate more interest in terms of eyeballs if they go down the same route.\u201d In 2021, the Saudi government-controlled PIF bankrolled LIV Golf, reportedly at a cost of $2 billion, attracting many of the sport\u2019s top players away from the US-based PGA Tour and Europe-based DP World Tour by offering big dollar prize money, with PGA Tour board member Jimmy Dunne raising fears that they might end up \u201cowning golf.\u201d Earlier this year, the US-based PGA Tour announced it was set to partner with the Saudi-backed breakaway LIV Golf, ending a feud that has dogged the men\u2019s professional game for the past year, with Dunne warning that sport\u2019s governing body had no choice but to reach the truce to retain some measure of control. \u201cThey have an unlimited horizon and an unlimited amount of money,\u201d he said at a contentious Senate hearing on the truce between the two tours. When it comes to soccer, Aleksander Ceferin, president of European football\u2019s governing body UEFA, has dismissed the competitive threat that the SPL could pose. \u201cAs far as I know, Mbappe and [Erling] Haaland don\u2019t dream of Saudi Arabia. I don\u2019t believe that the best players at the pinnacle of their careers would go to Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said last month. \u201cWhen people talk to me about the players who went there, nobody knows where they\u2019re playing.\u201d Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp took a different view, referring to the fact that the Saudi summer transfer window stays open after European clubs see theirs close: \u201cI don\u2019t know how stable it is and I think the next two weeks will show how much of a challenge it is because whatever happens there, no one can react anymore. \u201cI don\u2019t know where it will lead to but it feels rather like a threat or a concern than not because I can\u2019t see how we really deny it in these moments, what can we do?\u201d he added. Still, the new SPL director of football, Michael Emenalo, says what Saudi soccer is doing is \u201cno different from what the Premier League have done.\u201d \u201cThere was a time when it was all about Italy. There was a time when it was all about Spain. What we\u2019re looking for in the industry is an opportunity to compete, and to compete on an even scale and to improve upon whatever exists in the industry,\u201d said Emenalo in a press release sent to CNN. New Saudi Pro League Chief Operating Officer Carlo Nohra told CNN that there is logic behind the league\u2019s strategy of money is no object to lure international stars. \u201cWe can\u2019t expect to be paying market value to entice people to come here at this early stage in our development.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0But analysts say that the difference lies in the level of transparency, which \u201csimply doesn\u2019t exist in Saudi Arabia,\u201d Chadwick explained to CNN. European soccer governing body UEFA has financial fair play (FFP) rules on teams\u2019 spending, while Major League Soccer in the US has a salary cap for its clubs. Nohra told CNN that, eventually, the country wants 0.3% of its GDP to be from soccer to make it similar to that of the Premier League on the UK economy \u2013 up from its current value of \u201c0.000 something.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve got no chance to get into that figure at present,\u201d Maguire explained, but added that the SPL could perhaps move into the top 10 of the world\u2019s domestic leagues. \u201cThat is feasible given the amount of money that they\u2019re spending.\u201d \u201cI think they\u2019re realistic. They don\u2019t say that they\u2019re going to overtake La Liga or the Premier League or the major European leagues,\u201d Maguire said. When the Peterson Institute for International Economics compared the world\u2019s sovereign wealth funds on criteria including governance, transparency and accountability in 2019, the PIF scored well below average on a measure combining these criteria, and ranked in the bottom 10 out of 64 funds, just above Russian Direct Investment Fund. CNN has reached out to the PIF for further comment about its investments in sport, particularly soccer and golf, and criticisms about its lack of transparency. Chadwick raised concerns over how a lack of financial rules affecting Saudi clubs might dilute UEFA\u2019s FFP regulations, as well as those of the Premier League, or impact world soccer governing body FIFA\u2019s systems of governance. The lack of transparency in Saudi Arabia\u2019s wealth fund has already raised suspicions in the US golfing and political spheres. Earlier this summer, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations launched an inquiry about the PGA Tour\u2019s agreement with the PIF-controlled LIV Golf. Chadwick told CNN that, so long as there is no independent organization that monitors the reporting of every league\u2019s financial endeavors, \u201cnobody really knows for sure what the accurate financial information is.\u201d \u201cThis vacuum [of information], this uncertainty is wrapped in a veneer of lobbying, which is intended to either overinflate or underinflate player transfer values and salary information because it serves a political purpose,\u201d Chadwick says, adding that this purpose is \u201csignaling.\u201d \u201cIt is almost as though football players are becoming kind of geopolitical pawns in some ways.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/09/20/sport/saudi-arabia-soccer-spl-bin-salman-intl-spt-cmd-dg/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_sport_matthew-briggs-premier-league-history-spt-intl", "text": "Matthew Briggs was still at school when he made soccer history, becoming the youngest player to feature in the English Premier League. The teenage sensation was just 16 years and 65 days old when he made his debut in arguably the toughest league in the world, coming on as a second-half substitute for Fulham in a 3-1 win in 2007. That \u201csurreal moment\u201d seemingly was the start of an exciting career in the game \u2013 Briggs was once tipped as a future England captain. Instead it was the beginning of a tumultuous journey which hit rock bottom as he stood on the edge of a hotel balcony in Dubai. \u201cI had pushed myself from my family and my friends. I felt like I had nobody,\u201d Briggs tells CNN Sport, reflecting on how he felt in 2018. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018What\u2019s the point? I might as well just end it all now because all that I\u2019m feeling will stop.\u2019\u201d Bright beginnings Briggs was one of the country\u2019s most exciting young talents as a teenager and he progressed quickly through the youth ranks. He was bigger, faster and stronger than his peers, meaning he would regularly play in the older age groups. If he was growing up in the US, he jokes, he would have been the \u201cjock.\u201d He joined Fulham\u2019s academy but was always being tracked by some of England\u2019s biggest clubs, namely the likes of Arsenal. It was at this time, with Briggs weighing up his options, that Fulham fast-tracked him to the first-team for the last game of the 2006/07 season. Briggs was rewarded with a cameo appearance, coming on for the last 13 minutes against Middlesborough to write his name into the record books. \u201cWhen I made my debut, I was instantly thinking I\u2019m the next Wayne Rooney, as any kid would,\u201d Briggs says, referring to the former Premier League star. \u201cEveryone started looking at me like a superstar, like a famous person, when I didn\u2019t feel like that myself.\u201d After making his first senior appearance, Briggs had assumed he would be part of the first-team\u2019s plans the following season. Instead, he was sent back to the youth team, a decision which knocked his confidence. \u201cI started feeling stuff that I\u2019d never done before,\u201d he says. \u201cOverthinking game situations, thinking I\u2019m going to have a bad game, just constantly doubting myself all the time.\u201d They were feelings that Briggs bottled up, as many of his peers did, nervous to expose any potential weakness at such a pivotal moment in his young career. Downward spiral The teenager was almost living a double life. To those on the outside, Briggs was still full of confidence, still the next best thing, still \u201cthe man.\u201d But things on the pitch were not getting better. He spent time away from Fulham on loan at other clubs but nothing really worked out. He eventually left the club in 2014 having made just 13 Premier League appearances in the seven years since making his debut. Briggs began slipping down the divisions, hampered by injuries, low confidence and a worsening struggle with mental health. He suddenly found himself playing in non-league, a level he never imagined he would ever be at. A sense of lost potential and the misplaced feeling of letting people down was the final straw, and Briggs eventually \u201cexploded.\u201d He stopped playing soccer for a year in 2018, turning to alcohol and drugs in search of the feeling he once had playing in front of thousands of spectators. \u201cWhere else can I find this adrenaline? Where else can I go and be the man? It was in the clubs,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was going out partying because I knew, if I go out, people are going to recognize me and I know who I am and I\u2019m going to feel like the man again.\u201d It got to the point where Briggs began using substances to self-medicate his struggles with anxiety and depression, looking for anything to numb the pain. He could no longer watch soccer, unable to deal with the thought of what could have been. \u2018Who am I if I\u2019m not a footballer?\u2019 The partying took him to vacation in Dubai, where he was also searching for a club to start playing for. But he kept hearing rejections and everything became too much. It left him on his hotel balcony, contemplating whether life was still worth living. \u201cI was so used to hearing, \u2018Yes, yes, yes,\u2019 every single club in the country wanting Matthew Briggs,\u201d he says. \u201cIt got to the point where I felt like I was a nobody. Who am I if I\u2019m not a footballer?\u201d Fortunately, he says hotel security saw him and moved him to a room on the lower floor. It\u2019s a moment Briggs says he often thinks about and is now so grateful to those who stopped him from stepping off. In the year when he walked away from soccer, Briggs moved in with his uncle. While he remembers some dark days when he would just sit in a room with his thoughts, he also credits that period with turning his life around. His uncle found him some work on a building site, where Briggs helped out with construction. The job helped rebuild his confidence but also served as a warning shot. He wanted more from life, and it motivated him to get back into the game he loved. He started therapy, leaning on the resources offered by the Professional Footballers Association (PFA) \u2013 a union for all current and former players. For the first time in his life, Briggs learned how to deal with the feelings he had struggled with for years. He allowed himself to feel vulnerable and slowly began building his life back. He also started \u201cbegging\u201d former clubs for another chance. He eventually signed for another non-league side and had \u201cone of the best seasons I\u2019ve ever had in my career.\u201d While he was clearly too good for that level, the experience allowed Briggs to fall in love with the sport all over again. While never receiving a call up to the England senior team \u2013 Briggs did play for the England youth sides \u2013 he had previously played internationally for Guyana in 2015. After a four-year hiatus, he managed to persuade the national team to also give him another chance. In 2019, Briggs made the squad for Guyana\u2019s CONCACAF Gold Cup campaign and relished the opportunity. He was back playing in front of major crowds and lined up against the US men\u2019s team, Panama and Trinidad & Tobago. While Guyana finished bottom of the group \u2013 picking up its first ever Gold Cup point in the process \u2013 Briggs impressed and was scouted by Danish side HB K\u00f8ge. It offered him a ticket back to playing professional soccer \u2013 a moment that still fills him with immense pride. \u201cI\u2019ve gone from not playing football at all anymore, feeling suicidal, to then getting myself back into the game and managing to get myself back to playing professionally,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter that, I then became captain of my country. For me, that\u2019s probably my proudest moment because it shows that it\u2019s never too late to start again.\u201d \u2018Victim of my own success\u2019 Having retired from soccer in 2023 following a string of injuries, Briggs struggled with the prospect of what would come next. He once again leaned on support which helped him discover a passion for helping young players in the game today. He is now back at Fulham, where his odyssey began, working with academy players and providing support to young stars who are starting to forge a career in the game. Teaching teenagers to communicate their worries and fears \u2013 something Briggs only learned later in life \u2013 is one of the main focuses of his work, as well as fostering an environment where people feel safe being vulnerable. \u201cI was probably a victim of my own success. I went up to the first team and kind of got lost in that environment. \u201cWhereas now, when young players do achieve what they deserve and go with the first team, we make sure we keep that connection with them.\u201d Briggs is fully aware his story isn\u2019t entirely unique. Thousands of young players are fed into the academy system every year, with only a tiny percentage ever making it. He says the support and pastoral care is now \u201chead and shoulders\u201d above what he experienced as a child. For example, in 2012, the Elite Player Performance Plan (EPPP) was launched by the English Premier League and offered clubs more guidance around player care. \u201cEnsuring that the Academy experience is a life-enriching one for every young player is a key part of taking a broader view of success,\u201d Neil Saunders, the Premier League\u2019s director of football, said in 2022. \u201cNot just judging the success of the system by those players that go on and play in the first team, but also what destination those players go on to have beyond playing.\u201d There is also support offered by the PFA \u2013 a service which Briggs leant on during his career. \u201cWe encourage players to seek help and use the resources available to them. The PFA has empathetic, experienced professionals and extensive provisions to assist players in navigating challenges both inside and outside the game,\u201d the PFA said in a statement. Finding peace Briggs held the Premier League record for the youngest player for 12 years, before it was broken by current Liverpool star Harvey Elliot, who was also handed his debut by Fulham in 2019. The record was broken again by Arsenal\u2019s Ethan Nwaneri in 2022. Briggs has since described Elliot breaking his record as a \u201cbittersweet\u201d moment. On one hand, he was sad to lose such a prestigious accolade but, on the other, he felt the pressure lift from his shoulders. Now, he says he wants to use his story to \u201chelp, motivate and inspire others.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/sport/matthew-briggs-premier-league-history-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}

{"id": "2024_06_25_sport_england-slovenia-denmark-serbia-spt-intl", "text": "England secured top spot in Group C with a goalless draw against Slovenia on Tuesday, but another underwhelming performance throws up more questions about the Three Lions\u2019 status as one of the Euro 2024 favorites. In the other game, Denmark and Serbia drew 0-0 as the Red and Whites finished second in the group, though Slovenia\u2019s squad celebrated its historic first European Championship knockouts qualification as one of the four best third-placed teams. England enjoyed 71% possession but did nothing to respond to the criticism leveled at the team in the days since another lethargic and fearful performance against Denmark. The team created few real chances of note and were again met by boos at full-time from traveling England fans. Gareth Southgate\u2019s side did show improvements in the second half after the introductions of Kobbie Mainoo and Cole Palmer, but the Three Lions never really threatened Atl\u00e9tico Madrid keeper Jan Oblak. Worries for England? Slovenia knew a draw could be enough to see it through to the knockout stages for the first time in history but would be reliant on results elsewhere going its way. England, meanwhile, had been heavily criticized for two poor performances to open Euro 2024: a narrow 1-0 win over Serbia and a 1-1 draw with Denmark. The team\u2019s half-hearted pressing and its overly cautious approach have been the primary sources of frustrations for England fans, but Southgate\u2019s side had the chance to be more free-spirited against Slovenia given results on Monday ensured the Three Lions a place in the last 16. England thought it had taken the lead after 20 minutes when Bukayo Saka tapped in at the far post from Phil Foden\u2019s square pass, but the Manchester City forward was offside in the build-up. All in all, however, it was another dismal half of football from England, which enjoyed the vast majority of possession without causing Slovenia any real problems. The Slovenians looked comfortable on the ball during their few brief spells of possession and got into some dangerous areas, but a lack of quality meant those rare forays forward came to nothing. Southgate has so far been unable to find a midfield pairing that\u2019s worked for him at Euro 2024, this time opting to start Conor Gallagher alongside Declan Rice instead of Trent Alexander-Arnold. Gallagher only lasted the first half, however, with Southgate opting to bring on Manchester United teenager Kobbie Mainoo. There was a slight improvement in England\u2019s intensity to begin the second half, but Slovenia still looked comfortable allowing the Three Lions to pass the ball around in front of them. Chelsea forward Cole Palmer made his long awaited debut at this tournament, coming on for Saka after 70 minutes, but there was little change in England\u2019s approach going forward. Rice and Foden exchanged a neat one-two that resulted in the former flashing a shot across goal, but it was never close enough to trouble Oblak. Palmer had perhaps England\u2019s best chance towards the end after being found by Harry Kane, but his tame effort from the edge of the area was easily held by the Atleti keeper. England\u2019s slight improvement in the second half, though, will likely have Southgate rethinking his starting lineup ahead of the last 16.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/sport/england-slovenia-denmark-serbia-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}
