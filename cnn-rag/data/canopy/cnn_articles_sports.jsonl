But she is among the few who have feared what victory may bring. \u201cI was afraid that if I was able to win, all of my success would be discredited because I was trans,\u201d Cortez-Fields, a senior on the women\u2019s swim team at New Jersey\u2019s Ramapo College, told CNN. As an NCAA competitor, Cortez-Fields underwent more than a year of hormone therapy, blood tests and testosterone tracking to meet the association\u2019s transgender athlete guidelines and achieve her dream of swimming alongside other women. In recent weeks, however, the NCAA has faced a flood of calls to further restrict the participation of trans students after a much smaller athletics association, the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), voted to effectively ban trans women from competing in most of its women\u2019s sports programs. Last month, the NCAA announced its policy is \u201cunder review.\u201d Marshi Smith, the co-founder of the Independent Council on Women\u2019s Sports (ICONS), which fights against trans women\u2019s participation in women\u2019s sports, applauded the NAIA\u2019s ban as a \u201ccrucial measure\u201d and called on the NCAA to \u201crelease a policy that protects the women\u2019s category.\u201d Critics like Smith argue that transgender women \u2013 even those who have undergone treatment to lower their testosterone levels\u00a0\u2013 have unfair physical advantages that would deprive cisgender women of opportunities to succeed. But transgender athletes and their advocates point to a lack of consistent, direct research to support this claim. They say trans women deserve the right to compete alongside their peers. \u201cThe idea that trans women are taking over women\u2019s sport is a pretty outside statement given the number of trans women who are competing in the NCAA,\u201d said Anna Baeth, director of research at Athlete Ally, an organization that advocates for LGBTQ equality in sports. Baeth estimates fewer than 40 of the NCAA\u2019s more than 500,000 athletes are known to be transgender. Last month, Athlete Ally sent the NCAA letters signed by more than 400 current and former professional and collegiate athletes, as well as hundreds of researchers and advocacy groups, imploring the organization to continue allowing transgender athletes to compete. \u201cTo deny transgender athletes the fundamental right to be who they are, to access the sport they love, and to receive the proven mental and physical health benefits of sport goes against the very principles of the NCAA\u2019s Constitution,\u201d read the letter signed by athletes including retired US women\u2019s national soccer team star Megan Rapinoe. \u201cEvery single student should have access to the lifesaving power of sports.\u201d \u2018I believed I needed to sacrifice being trans in order to swim\u2019 Competitive swimming pools have become a battleground in the fight over transgender athletes\u2019 exclusion, exploding into focus when University of Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas became the first transgender athlete to win an NCAA Division I title in 2022. Smith, the ICONS co-founder, said watching Thomas compete \u201cwas really devastating.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s unfair,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt like I was witnessing women shriveling up.\u201d The NCAA\u2019s policy was revised in 2022 to align \u201ctransgender student-athlete participation with the Olympic Movement.\u201d The association takes a sport-by-sport approach, which allows trans players to participate if they have undergone one year of testosterone suppression treatment and meet the testosterone level required by their sport\u2019s national or international governing body. Trans women athletes, including Cortez-Fields, say competing alongside other women is a crucial step toward feeling like their authentic selves and can help combat feelings of isolation. \u201cTrans people have existed since the beginning of time. But we win and it becomes an issue,\u201d she said. For Cortez-Fields, plunging into the muffled echo of the water has always felt like a sacred moment. But that embracing environment became increasingly fraught as she began to express her trans identity during her second season on the men\u2019s team. \u201cWearing a men\u2019s suit, having to tape my breasts, even just competing against men \u2013 it starts to hurt more because it feels like a part of you is dying and wilting away,\u201d she said. \u201cI believed I needed to sacrifice being trans in order to swim.\u201d Cortez-Fields spent more than a year undergoing hormone therapy, meticulously tracking her testosterone levels and trying to train even as her body no longer allowed her to glide through the water with the speed and stamina she once did. Finally, in her senior year, she was cleared by the NCAA to compete on the women\u2019s team, which Cortez-Fields said at the time was \u201cone of the most exciting things that\u2019s ever happened.\u201d She recalls her final meet in February as \u201cone of the best meets of my entire life.\u201d \u201cEvery single moment was just magical,\u201d she said. \u201cI just felt like I was literally flying to the water.\u201d During the meet, Cortez-Fields broke two school records and placed 2nd in the 100-yard butterfly \u2013 successes she says were scrutinized by anti-trans groups and conservative news outlets but widely celebrated by her teammates. \u201cThe majority of the women I have met and swim against, they have celebrated me. They make me feel like I deserve to be there, and I should fight for my place there,\u201d she said. What the research does \u2013 and doesn\u2019t \u2013 say The debate is complicated by a lack of significant research \u2013 and scientific consensus \u2013\u00a0on whether trans athletes, particularly trans women, have an athletic advantage over their cisgender peers, even after they have undergone testosterone-reducing therapies. Dr. Joshua Safer, executive director of the Mount Sinai Center for Transgender Medicine and Surgery, said many elite sports associations are trying to craft policies without meaningful data on how trans athletes perform in their specific categories, such as soccer or basketball. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to be \u2018fair\u2019 \u2013 however fair is defined \u2013 then you need to look at individual athletic activities directly,\u201d Safer said. \u201cIt would be a matter of taking transgender people who participate in sports and looking at them before and after some of their treatments and really measuring differences, especially in common sports.\u201d Such studies may be especially difficult to perform given the relatively small number of trans athletes known to be competing at elite levels. Though research is ongoing, a 2017 review in the journal Sports Medicine found \u201cno direct or consistent research\u201d showing trans people have an advantage. A more recent October 2023 review concluded that sex differences do develop following puberty, but many are \u201creduced, if not erased, over time by gender affirming hormone therapy.\u201d\u00a0 Qualities such as height and limb length appear to be \u201cless malleable,\u201d the study said, though it pointed out that there are no efforts to restrict cisgender athletes who are exceptionally gifted physically. Until more data is available, Safer believes governing bodies like the NCAA should be wary of enacting sweeping restrictions so that \u201cwe don\u2019t get ahead of ourselves.\u201d \u201cAssociations should err on the side of being cautious and inclusive until data indicates that there may be an advantage, and then they can make adjustments,\u201d he said. Looking for a lifeline in Title IX In the absence of a scientific consensus, both sides have argued their case by invoking Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in federally funded education programs. Trans advocacy organizations remain hopeful that President Joe Biden\u2019s administration will follow through on its proposal last year to revise Title IX to bar schools from enacting bans on transgender athletes. \u201cTitle IX is really the only major legislation at the federal level that protects cisgender women athletes, and we do believe that should apply to trans athletes,\u201d said Baeth with Athlete Ally. \u201cWe want Title IX to consider gender, not just sex assigned at birth.\u201d Any direct mention of trans athletes was notably missing, however, from the Biden administration\u2019s changes to Title IX last month, which expanded protections for LGBTQ students. Before the new changes were announced, a senior Biden administration official told reporters that the process of reviewing the trans sports protections is \u201congoing.\u201d But some cisgender athletes and conservative lawmakers see the inclusion of trans women in women\u2019s sports as a striking violation of Title IX\u2019s nondiscrimination rule. In March, more than a dozen current and former collegiate female athletes sued the NCAA over its transgender participation policy and accused the organization of a \u201cradical departure from Title IX\u2019s original meaning\u201d by allowing trans women to compete against cisgender women. Their outcry was echoed last month by more than a dozen Republican lawmakers who wrote in a letter to NCAA president Charlie Baker that they believe transgender women\u2019s participation will deprive cisgender women \u201cof a fair opportunity to compete and achieve athletic success.\u201d Republican lawmakers at the state and local level have largely driven the push to bar trans people from competing in sports aligning with their gender identity, and their efforts have not been confined to elite competition. Restrictions against trans players have spread across Little League baseball diamonds, high school soccer fields and into the halls of state legislatures nationwide. At least 25 states have laws or regulations in place that ban transgender students, particularly trans women and girls, from participating on the team that aligns with their gender identity, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit think tank that tracks such legislation. Cortez-Fields says that while the bans are not surprising, she fears the impact they\u2019ll have on many trans children who may already be struggling to overcome feelings of isolation. \u201cPart of gender affirming care, in a sense, is being able to compete on the team of your gender and with fellow people of your gender,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a small minority, but that minority does matter, and they deserve their fair participation as well.\u201d CNN\u2019s DJ Judd contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/sport/naia-ncaa-transgender-ban-sports/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "sports"}}

It is not often, in any sport, that you get to sign a generational talent, especially here in Philadelphia in soccer,\u201d Union head coach Jim Curtin said in Sullivan\u2019s introductory news conference Thursday. Sullivan becomes the youngest player in club history to be added to the first-team roster, and the fifth youngest player to ink a first-team contract in MLS history. If the 14-year-old midfielder makes his debut for the Union on or before July 29, 2024, \u201che will become the youngest player to make his debut among the top North American professional sports leagues (MLB, MLS, NBA, NFL, NHL, NWSL) as well as the youngest player to make his debut among the top five European soccer leagues,\u201d\u00a0according to the Union. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly not afraid of putting him on the field at any time,\u201d Curtin said on Thursday when Sullivan could make his first-team debut. \u201cHe\u2019s going to work hard and make it on the field on merit first and foremost. \u201cI\u2019ll just say it publicly, it\u2019s a lot closer than people may realize. You know, again, our team whatever you need that week, he\u2019s going to be called upon quickly because he deserves it.\u201d Philadelphia next take the field against Orlando City on May 11. Last year, Sullivan was named the Golden Ball winner after scoring four goals in the tournament and leading the US to the 2023 Concacaf Boy\u2019s Under-15 Championship \u2013 the first time the team has ever won the tournament. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching my home team, the Union, for as long as I remember and hoped that one day I\u2019d get the chance to play for my city in front of my family, friends, and fans,\u201d said Sullivan. \u201cBeing able to not only play for the Union but to be able\u00a0to play with my brother is a dream come true. I will give everything I have to this club and hope to help bring home some hardware. I\u2019m thankful for the opportunity and hope to make Philadelphia proud.\u201d Sullivan\u2019s older brother, Quinn, 20, has played for the Union\u2019s first team since 2021. According to ESPN, Sullivan has a release clause that will allow him to transfer to English Premier League side\u00a0Manchester City after he turns 18. \u201cHe\u2019s super talented, clearly, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t be sitting here having this discussion, but he\u2019s got this attacking mindset that is fearless. He creates goals, he scores goals, he can do it in every facet,\u201d Sullivan\u2019s Union II head coach Marlon LeBlanc\u00a0said. \u201cHe\u2019s a generational talent, sky\u2019s the limit and we\u2019re just going to continue to help allow him to give him a platform in order to continue to grow.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/sport/philadelphia-union-cavan-sullivan-soccer/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "sports"}}

The Northern Irishman mounted a magnificent, final-round charge to power to his fourth career Wells Fargo Championship, finishing five shots ahead of American Xander Schauffele on 17-under overall at Quail Hollow in North Carolina. McIlroy had trailed world No. 3 Schauffele by two strokes after seven holes but tore away from the overnight leader down the stretch, carding four birdies and two eagles in a dazzling eight-hole run. Even with a closing double bogey, McIlroy\u2019s six-under 65 was still the best score of the day, easily enough to secure his 26th PGA Tour crown and a second in a row after triumph at the Zurich Classic alongside fellow Irishman Shane Lowry last month. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s more unbelievable, winning a PGA Tour event for the fourth time or getting my 26th,\u201d McIlroy \u2013 who previously won the event in 2010, 2015 and 2021 \u2013 told reporters. \u201cWhenever I hit some of these milestones or do these things, I always think back to 20-year-old me playing in this tournament for the first time. If I had known back then that this is the way everything was going to pan out, I probably wouldn\u2019t have believed you.\u201d \u2018No strain\u2019 with Woods McIlroy had made headlines after his first round on Wednesday, revealing that he would not be returning to the PGA Tour policy board. The world No. 2 said a potential comeback had been dashed following \u201cpretty complicated and messy\u201d conversations, adding that some of the current board were \u201cuncomfortable\u201d with him reclaiming the position he left after two years in November. Tiger Woods is one of six player directors on the current board, having\u00a0joined\u00a0last August. Woods and McIlroy are longtime friends as well as business partners, having teamed up to launch the TGL, a high-tech indoor golf venture that has been postponed until 2025 after its inflatable dome venue collapsed. McIlroy brushed off any suggestion of a soured relationship with the 15-time major winner, adding that he had a seat on the \u201ctransaction subcommittee\u201d attempting to strike a deal with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF), which funds LIV Golf. \u201cI think friends can have disagreements or not see eye to eye on things \u2026 I think that\u2019s fine,\u201d McIlroy said Thursday when asked if his relationship with Woods had been strained. \u201cWe had a really good talk last Friday for 45 minutes just about a lot of different things. There\u2019s no strain there. I think we might see the future of golf a little bit differently, but I don\u2019t think that should place any strain on a relationship or on a friendship.\u201d \u2018It feels like the stars are aligning\u2019 A second straight victory, which secured a $3.6 million winner\u2019s cut of a $20 million prize purse, increases McIlroy\u2019s momentum ahead of the PGA Championship next week. The 35-year-old is a four-time major champion and has played some of his best golf in recent years, but is now into his 10th year without a major win despite 20 top-10 finishes in that time. Buoyed by his recent form, McIlroy heads to Valhalla Golf Club in Kentucky chasing his third PGA Championship title at the site of his last major triumph. \u201cI really got some confidence from New Orleans, winning with Shane,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cComing into this week at a golf course that I\u2019m comfortable at, my golf swing feels a lot more comfortable than it has. So going to a venue next week where I\u2019ve won, it feels like the stars are aligning a little bit. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got a lot of golf to play and a lot of great players to try to beat next week.

His five double faults were particularly costly. \u201cI was just trying to keep my nerves in, trying to keep swinging,\u201d added Tabilo. \u201cObviously every time you feel like you are closer to the end, your arms start to get a little tighter and you start to swing shorter, so I was just trying to not think about it and take it point by point.

{"id": "sport_garia-luxury-golf-carts-road-legal-intl", "text": "From the blooming azaleas of Augusta National to the breathtaking lighthouse at Turnberry in Scotland, golf is renowned for its natural beauty. The same cannot be said, however, for the sport\u2019s primary mode of transport. But one Danish company is on a mission to put the art in golf cart. Copenhagen-based Garia is the self-described \u201cworld\u2019s first and only\u201d luxury golf and leisure car brand (that\u2019s\u00a0car, not cart), whose aims to regenerate the traditional golf buggy have led to ambitions that lie far beyond the confines of the 18-hole course. Such goals seemed a long drive away in 2005 when Anders Lynge, still in design school, met Soren Bak Hansen during an internship at a car company. A short while later, having spotted a gap in the market, the duo founded Garia. \u201cWhen it came to the golf cart 18 years ago, they all looked the same \u2013 there weren\u2019t any serious high-end products out there,\u201d Lynge told CNN. \u201cIf you lived in a high-end community \u2013 paying hundreds of thousands of dollars of membership fees, a $10 million house, whatever you had \u2013 the whole lifestyle of these people, from their cars to their clothes, watches; everything was super personalized. \u201cWe thought it was strange that they all had the same type of golf cart \u2026 So the idea behind Garia was basically to say, \u2018How can we make a product that fulfils the lifestyle of these people, that has the same sort of quality that they\u2019re used to from every other product they surround themselves with?\u2019 \u201cThat really changed our focus to say, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s do that: the ultimate golf car.\u2019\u201d Reinventing the wheel(s) Achieving that aim was easier said than done when the team was effectively tasked with reinventing the wheel and \u2013 as Lynge remarked \u2013 an unattractive one at that. There are several reasons for the uniformity of the traditional golf buggy, narrow and vertical in shape, Lynge explained. The universal requirement of having to fit onto golf courses and their various cart paths \u2013 needing to perform 180-degree turns in a cul-de-sac \u2013 limits design creativity. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to do a new bicycle or a new motorcycle,\u201d Lynge said. \u201cYou\u2019re so heavily constrained from a technical standpoint. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst kind of shape you can have \u2013 it doesn\u2019t look very dynamic. You want something that\u2019s sort of Lamborghini-shaped \u2013 very low and wide \u2013 but the golf cart is the exact opposite.\u201d Yet solutions emerged: extending the wheelbase, enlarging the cabin, unprecedented 12-inch alloy wheels without hubcaps that replaced the traditional \u201cdeep dish\u201d look, and a double wishbone front suspension \u2013 common in sports cars \u2013 to boost handling. Garia\u2019s vehicles may look bigger and more \u201cmuscular\u201d than the average golf cart, but the proportions are the same as any other standard buggy. This is simply a visual \u201ctrick\u201d \u2013 and far from the only one. A storage box tucked behind the seat serves to lift the beltline, slashing cabin space to give it more of a car feel, while accent lines and wheels pushed out to the edges help ground the vehicle. Lynge toyed extensively with positive and negative space, taking inspiration from Porsche\u2019s 911 to use convex and concave shapes across the car. It makes warehouse storage a \u201cnightmare,\u201d but the visual payoffs are worth the trouble, Lynge says. Elite company In fact, it is rare that any two Garias look exactly the same. Using an online configurator inspired by Nike\u2019s shoe customizer, prospective buyers can hand-pick almost every aspect of their vehicle; from body and roof color \u2013 44 options and rising \u2013 to wheels and interior features like refrigerators and cup holders. There are millions of possible combinations, Lynge insists. German luxury car modification firm Mansory, which works with clients including Bentley and Lamborghini, provides a range of accessories and even a full carbon-fiber car. Other collaborations have included German Bugatti supplier Kussmaul, which Garia paired with to build a single, special edition chrome car capable of doing 0 to 40 kilometers per hour (25 miles per hour) in less than two seconds. Another involved Mercedes, whom Lynge first made contact with after winning a competition run by the car giant to design a golf cart. Lynge took the prize ceremony event as an opportunity to pitch a dream that would be realized in 2016 \u2013 a Garia golf car inspired by Mercedes-Benz Style. Retailing at just under \u20ac80,000 ($86,000), the fully carbon-fiber car had twice the battery life and twice the power of a typical Garia, topping out at speeds of 69 kilometers per hour (43 miles per hour). \u201cReally expensive \u2026 super exclusive, but also the coolest golf car you\u2019ll ever see,\u201d Lynge said. Out of bounds Its scarcity means only a select few will have been seen on European roads. Making street legal models was always the plan for Garia, but achieving certification is no easy feat. Extensive \u2013 and therefore expensive \u2013 safety and crash testing is required to gain road-status, and requirements differ across regions. While Europe allows for greater speeds, the US employs a strict 40 kilometers per hour (25 miles per hour) legal limit on such vehicles. But that did not discourage Lynge, who saw the prevalence of golf communities in the US as a potentially lucrative market for Garia. The company was sold by the Lars Larsen Group to American golf and utility giant Club Car in 2022. The base version of Garia\u2019s two-seater golf car \u2013 without any customization or additional features \u2013 has a manufacturer suggested retail price of \u20ac14,939 ($16,100), with the four-seater edition starting from \u20ac20,189 ($21,770). The street legal variants for both Europe and the US come in at \u20ac18,959 ($20,440) for the two-seat model and rise to \u20ac21,219 ($22,880) for four seats. \u201cWe very much felt that these cars are so fun to drive and they are fun to interact with,\u201d Lynge said. \u201cI don\u2019t know the exact percentage, but a great part of our cars are also bought by people who don\u2019t play golf.

{"id": "2024_05_04_sport_grande-torino-superga-disaster-75th-anniversary-spt-intl", "text": "Umberto Motto had always dreamed of playing for Torino FC. He had dreamed of pulling on the team\u2019s maroon shirt in front of thousands of adoring fans. And he had dreamed of hearing his name announced as he made his way onto the pitch at the Stadio Filadelfia. A local boy born in the northern Italian city of Turin and the captain of Torino\u2019s youth team, Motto seemed destined to represent his boyhood club. His dream did come true \u2013 and sooner than he expected \u2013 but the day was a living nightmare. On May 4, 1949, Motto was giving a tour of Turin to two clients of his parents\u2019 factory, which manufactured shirts for Torino and the Italian national team. Motto recalls a dense fog that hung over the city and says it hadn\u2019t stopped raining for seven days straight, leading the river Po to burst its banks in places. So bad was the weather that Motto decided to abandon sightseeing in the city and take the two visitors up to the Superga hill and Superga Basilica that overlook Turin, hoping to at least send the tourists home with a view to remember. The weather, however, was even worse and the fog meant they could barely see a few metres in front of their faces, much less the city below. On their way back down into Turin, the trio stopped for coffee and Motto remembers conversing with the caf\u00e9 owner about how unusually bad the weather had been. When they arrived back in the city, they were met by another unusual sight: the roads packed with cars all honking their horns. \u201cWe thought something good had happened,\u201d Motto, now 93 years old, recalls to CNN. Motto returned to the Torino FC headquarters in the city where he was met by the building\u2019s caretaker, Mario Lanati, who quickly ushered him upstairs. \u201cUmberto, you have to know that something disastrous has happened,\u201d Lanati told him. \u201cThe plane crashed.\u201d A confused Motto replied: \u201cWhich plane?\u201d Lanati\u2019s answer would irrevocably change Motto\u2019s life and the lives of everyone associated with Torino. The plane Lanati was talking about had been carrying almost the entire Torino first team from Lisbon, Portugal where it had been playing a friendly match against Benfica. With the approach to Turin-Aeritalia Airport affected by the weather conditions, the plane crashed into the side of the Superga hill, killing all 31 people on board. Among the dead were 18 of Torino\u2019s first-team players, its coaches, Italian sports journalists, and flight crew. It remains one of the biggest sporting disasters in history and immediately wiped out one of the greatest teams Italian football has ever known. That Torino side, affectionately known as \u2018Grande Torino\u2019 due to its incredible success, had been on the brink of securing a fifth straight Italian league title, while its players also formed the backbone of the Italian national team at the time. The impact on the city and its people was devastating. Author Roberto Pennino spent years interviewing those affected and recounts the sense of loss in his book \u2018Immortal Torino,\u2019 which has been released in English for the 75th anniversary of the disaster. \u201cThese players who perished on Superga, they were really approachable,\u201d Pennino tells CNN. \u201cYou could see them all over town. They went to the same restaurants, to the same cinemas, to the same bakeries as their supporters. \u201cSo when they perished, they were \u2013 as a team \u2013 missed deeply, but also in the city itself. All the places they would be seen, and people could have a chat with them. A lot of people felt like they lost a relative.\u201d On top of the emotional scars that remain visible even 75 years later, Pennino says the sporting cost for Torino was \u201cdisastrous.\u201d The club didn\u2019t have the money or transfer coffers it does today. All of Torino\u2019s capital was on the pitch, Pennino explains. It\u2019s players. Clubs were supportive during Torino\u2019s plight. To an extent. Other Italian teams loaned \u2013 and even gave \u2013 players to Torino, Pennino says. \u201cBut never the best players, of course,\u201d he adds. Club president Feruccio Novo tried desperately to rebuild the team but would never achieve his goal. \u201cHe had an idea to make a second \u2018Grande Torino\u2019 and to buy stars, to honor those players, but also to keep up the with the results they had,\u201d Pennino says. But there was no money, and the support from other teams just wasn\u2019t enough. After winning five straight championships, Torino has won the first division title just once in the intervening 75 years, lifting the trophy in 1975-76. \u2018Forza ragazzi\u2019 Still trying to process what Lanati had told him, Motto remained in denial. Surely, this was impossible, he thought. He had just been on Superga and heard and saw nothing. Lanati sat Motto down by the radio and told him to listen. The next news report confirmed the tragedy. As the minutes and hours slowly ticked on, more and more people affiliated with the club began to arrive at the headquarters; the rest of the youth team, the players\u2019 wives and, finally, club president Novo. Motto remembers Novo, who only missed the trip to Lisbon due to an illness, had to be physically held up by two fans as he entered the building. \u201cHe was literally destroyed,\u201d Motto says. \u201cLike all of us.\u201d Motto says Novo considered the team more like sons than players. Some journalists had also managed to make it into the building, Motto recalls, and were asking questions to those present. They were met with only silence. \u201cNo one had the courage to speak,\u201d Motto says. \u201cBecause we understood that faced with a situation like this, there is no possibility of conversation.\u201d Days later, the players\u2019 families received the postcards they had been sent while the team was in Lisbon, a poignant detail that Pennino says still gives him goosebumps. With just four matches of the season remaining, the rest of the league and the Italian federation agreed to award Torino the title, but the team still needed to finish the season. The federation accepted a proposal from Torino that it would play its youth team, the champions of Italy at the time, against the youth teams of its four remaining opponents. Before the first match against Genoa \u2013 just 11 days after the crash \u2013 Motto remembers Novo coming into the changing room and hugging each player individually, before telling them: \u201cBoys, your masters are watching you.\u201d Even the referee had words of encouragement, according to Motto. \u201cForza ragazzi,\u201d the referee told the Torino players: \u201cCome on, boys.\u201d As the captain of the youth team, Motto was also made captain for the remaining four matches and led the team out onto the pitch against Genoa at the Stadio Filadelfia. Motto had made it. His dream was fulfilled. Only it had come in the most unimaginable of circumstances. Torino\u2019s youth players beat Genoa 4-0 in an atmosphere Motto has never forgotten. The level of noise usually only reserved for a goal boomed from the stands with every pass the team made. After beating Genoa, Torino went on to earn victories over Palermo, Sampdoria and Fiorentina in the final games of the season. \u201cThey honored their mentors in the best possible way,\u201d Pennino says. As many as 700,000 fans are estimated to have lined the streets as the players\u2019 caskets were driven through the city just two days after the crash. Today, the club continues to honor its heroes and will hold a service on Saturday, the 75th anniversary of the disaster, at the Monumental Cemetery in Turin, where some of the players are buried. Later that afternoon, there will be a mass in the Superga Basilica before the day finishes with a service at the Torino FC memorial at the top of the hill. \u201cThey are still remembered every year,\u201d Pennino says. \u201cOn May 4, the names are exclaimed on the Superga Hill. It\u2019s a worthy tribute to those great players.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/04/sport/grande-torino-superga-disaster-75th-anniversary-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "sports"}}

The 48-year-old did not meet the criteria to automatically make the 156-player field set to compete at Pinehurst Resort and Country Club in North Carolina on June 16, but will fight for his fourth US Open title after the United States Golf Association (USGA) \u2013 tournament organizers of the major \u2013 granted him a spot. \u201cThe US Open, our national championship, is a truly special event for our game and one that has helped define my career,\u201d Woods told the USGA. \u201cI\u2019m honored to receive this exemption and could not be more excited for the opportunity to compete in this year\u2019s US Open, especially at Pinehurst, a venue that means so much to the game.\u201d Woods has enjoyed a storied career at the tournament. The 15-time major champion clinched his first US Open crown in historically dominant fashion in 2000, finishing 15 shots clear of his closest chaser at Pebble Beach, before adding two more wins in 2002 and 2008, the latter of which he achieved despite a leg fracture and torn ligaments. Yet Woods did not compete at last year\u2019s tournament in Los Angeles as he continued his recovery from ankle surgery, an all too familiar tale in recent years given the long-term physical impacts of his 2021 car crash. Sporadic playing appearances have seen his world ranking plummet to world No. 789, well short of the top-60 position that would stamp a ticket to Pinehurst, but Woods\u2019 legacy at the major means his invitation for a third appearance at the venue was an \u201ceasy decision\u201d for organizers. \u201cThe story of the US Open could not be written without Tiger Woods,\u201d USGA Chief Championships Officer John Bodenhamer said in a statement. \u201cFrom his 15-stroke victory at Pebble Beach in 2000 to his inspiring win on a broken leg at Torrey Pines in 2008, this championship is simply better when Tiger is in the field, and his accomplishments in the game undoubtedly made this an easy decision for our special exemption committee.\u201d \u2018My goal is to ruin the logo\u2019 Woods will be hoping to build on a history-making outing at The Masters last month, when \u2013 in just his third competitive start in a year \u2013 he made the cut at Augusta National for an unprecedented 24th consecutive time. A tough weekend saw him finish 60th, 27 shots behind champion Scottie Scheffler, but Woods remains insistent that he can still close the gap on Jack Nicklaus\u2019 record of 18 major championships. Discussing his new sportswear brand \u201cSun Day Red\u201d on NBC\u2019s Today Show on Wednesday, Woods said it was his mission to \u201cruin\u201d his line\u2019s own logo, which sees 15 stripes \u2013 one for each major \u2013 form the shape of a Tiger. \u201cMy goal is to ruin the logo, I want to keep ruining the logo,\u201d Woods told Carson Daly. \u201cIf the trademark is this, my job is to ruin it.\u201d Woods\u2019 15-year-old son Charlie was one of 10,052 that attempted to qualify for this year\u2019s US Open, but fell short after shooting nine-over 81 at a local qualifying event in Florida. The top-five finishers there have advanced to the second and final qualifying stage \u2013 dubbed \u2018Golf\u2019s Longest Day\u2019 \u2013 held at 36-hole events across 10 US and three international venues in May and June.

Star wing Jaylen Brown scored 32 points in front of the home crowd at the TD Garden as the No. 1 seed Celtics showed why they are considered a favorite to win it all this season. Boston finished with an NBA-best 64-18 regular season record to earn the top seed. A Game 2 upset defeat against the Miami Heat in the first round turned out to be a momentary blip as the C\u2019s cruised past last year\u2019s runner-up in five games, and rarely looked like they were troubled against the Cavs on Tuesday. Brown \u2013 who signed the richest contract in NBA history this past offseason \u2013 shot efficiently from the floor, making 12 of his 18 field goal attempts and knocking down four three-pointers. \u201cI had it rolling tonight, but each and every game presents different challenges,\u201d Brown said after the game. \u201cI\u2019m excited for Game 2. Going to come out with the same mentality, but you gotta see how they might guard, might cover you. You just wanna come out and make the right plays, the right reads \u2013 that\u2019s all it is.\u201d Brown\u2019s teammate Derrick White credited Brown for creating opportunities for the rest of the Celtics squad as the Cleveland defense was forced to devote more attention to the All-Star. White finished with 25 points and made seven triples, while Payton Pritchard added 16 points off the bench. In a testament to Boston\u2019s depth and scoring talent, it was able to ease to the comfortable win despite missing big man Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is due to injury and superstar forward Jayson Tatum shooting 36.8% from the field and being held to 18 points. Despite the unusually subdued scoring night, Tatum still found ways to contribute, chipping in with 11 rebounds, five assists and three blocks. It was a disappointing start to the series for the Cavaliers after going through an intense battle in the first round. The No. 4 seed is a fresh off a hard-fought seven-game series against the Orlando Magic that only concluded on Sunday \u2013 in contrast, the Celtics were playing for the first time since last Wednesday. The Cavs were led by All-Star guard Donovan Mitchell, who posted 33 points, six rebounds and five assists while Evan Mobley and Darius Garland added 17 points and 14 points respectively. Starting center Jarrett Allen missed his fourth consecutive game with injury. Mitchell talked about the need to improve on defense to contain Boston\u2019s stars and spoke highly of Brown after the game. \u201cJaylen Brown\u2019s an All-NBA player, he makes $300 million for a reason,\u201d he said postgame. Game 2 tips off on Thursday night at 7 p.m. ET. OKC Thunder rumbles past Mavericks in Game 1 Over in the Western Conference, there was another blowout victory as the top-seeded Oklahoma City Thunder took down the Dallas Mavericks 117-95 at home. OKC was one of the regular season\u2019s unexpected storylines, with the young team appearing to be ahead of schedule as it earned the No. 1 spot in a loaded conference and sweeping the New Orleans Pelicans in the first round. The Thunder are spearheaded by MVP candidate Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. The Canadian flirted with a triple-double on Tuesday, recording 29 points, nine rebounds and nine assists to go along with two blocks and a steal. Rookie Chet Holmgren scored 19 points and Jalen Williams added 18, but perhaps the biggest success story of the night for the Thunder was the way they were able to frustrate Dallas guard Luka Don\u010di\u0107 on the defensive end. The Slovenian superstar was restricted to 19 points on 31.6% shooting and only connected on one of his eight three-point attempts as Lu Dort chased him on the perimeter and Holmgren provided problems in the paint. \u201cHe\u2019s just a warrior,\u201d OKC coach Mark Daigneault said of Dort postgame. \u201cBrings the juice every single night. Don\u010di\u0107 is a really hard matchup and a great player that didn\u2019t have his best pitch tonight. He\u2019s going to play better than this. Lu made it hard on him. I thought our team made it hard on him.\u201d Kyrie Irving led the Mavs in scoring with 20 points on a night that the Dallas squad will want to swiftly put in the rear view mirror. \u201cWho cares?\u201d Don\u010di\u0107 said when asked about his shooting. \u201cWe lost.

The 39-year-old, who led the Cavaliers to their first and only NBA championship in 2016, received a huge ovation from the crowd when he appeared on the big screen following a montage of his best moments in Cleveland. James\u2019 presence wasn\u2019t enough to inspire the Cavaliers, however, as Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum combined for 60 points to lift the Celtics to a commanding 3-1 series lead. Tatum finished with a game high 33 points to go with 11 rebounds, five assists and two steals, while Brown had 27 points and eight rebounds. The Cavaliers were without star guard Donovan Mitchell, who missed the contest due to a calf strain suffered in the fourth quarter of Game 3. The news was a pre-match sucker punch for Cleveland, with Mitchell putting up 33 points in the Game 3 loss on Saturday, his sixth straight playoff game scoring at least 25 points. In his absence, Darius Garland scored a team high 30 points, while Evan Mobley and Caris LeVert both added 19 in a gritty Cleveland performance that ultimately wasn\u2019t quite enough against the No. 1 seed Celtics. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing better than winning a playoff game on the road,\u201d Brown said, per ESPN. \u201cIt\u2019s like everybody against you guys, you come here with the guys in the locker room. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough environment, the crowd was great, but as a competitor, it\u2019s really fun to be in an environment like that, win on the road. \u201cNow it\u2019s time to go back and play well in front of our fans and give them something to cheer for and try to get a win.\u201d The Celtics will be looking to close out the series and book their place in the Eastern Conference finals when the two teams return to TD Garden for Game 5 on Wednesday.

The Enhanced Games says it is an \u201calternative\u201d to what it calls the \u201ccorrupt Olympics Games.\u201d Athletes competing at the Enhanced Games will be free to use performance-enhancing drugs, they won\u2019t be tested and will be under no obligation to declare which substances they have taken in order to compete. That\u2019s quite a contrast to the Olympics\u2019 doping protocols. The International Testing Agency (ITA) will be responsible for looking after Paris 2024\u2019s anti-doping program. Six years ago, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which oversees the Olympics, delegated its entire clean sport program to the ITA. However, historically the Olympic Games have been dogged by a series of doping and kickback scandals. When approached for comment on the Enhanced Games and allegations of corruption, the IOC told CNN Sport that \u201cthe idea does not merit any comment.\u201d \u2018Danger to health, to sport\u2019 CNN Sport interviewed a number of experts in the field of doping for this story, who expressed concern that the Enhanced Games was an extremely dangerous proposition. Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, who exposed Russia\u2019s state-sponsored doping program \u2013 a massive, years-long effort which benefited more than 1,000 athletes between 2011 and 2015 \u2013 said that the Enhanced Games is a \u201cdanger to health, to sport.\u201d Whether the Enhanced Games will ever take place remains an open question, but the very idea is drawing considerable blowback from leading anti-doping officials and sporting organizations. The Enhanced Games is the brainchild of businessman Aron D\u2019Souza. He is also the founding editor of \u201cThe Journal Jurisprudence,\u201d a quarterly publication on legal philosophy, according to his website, which also describes him as an \u201cavid athlete.\u201d Recently, D\u2019Souza told CNN Sport he has \u201csigned term sheets with prominent venture capital firms\u201d in relation to the Enhanced Games and is \u201cwaiting on the lawyers to finish long-form drafting.\u201d He also said that a funding announcement is planned for early December. Although not legally binding, term sheets are a serious expression of intent by both sides, setting out the broad principles of an agreement. D\u2019Souza believes what he calls a \u201cscience-driven\u201d competition is the next step in the evolution of sport, suggesting that the absence of drug testing will level the playing field. According to a 2020 study from Raphael Faiss, Research Manager at the centre of Research and Expertise in anti-doping sciences at the University of Lausanne, data from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) suggests less than 2% of athletes dope. However, Faiss told CNN Sport the number of athletes taking performance-enhancing drugs is likely significantly higher; his research, based on two international major athletic events in 2011 and 2013, suggests the figure could be between 15 to 18%. Faiss and his team compared athletes\u2019 blood results collected by WADA-accredited labs to values from healthy adults, as well as doped and undoped athletes; the closer the values are to those of subjects to whom erythropoietin (EPO, which is used in blood doping) had been administered, the higher the chances that they\u2019re actually doping. This analysis, Faiss said, is not proof of doping, but is a \u201crobust way\u201d of analyzing the data, allowing scientists to make an estimate for doping prevalence, as well as targeting athletes most likely to be doping. In written comments to CNN Sport, WADA said: \u201cDetermining the level of [doping] prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed,\u201d explaining that, since 2017, a \u201cprevalence working group\u201d has been established to \u201cdetermine if strategies, reliable methods and tools can be developed to adequately assess the prevalence of doping in sports.\u201d WADA told CNN Sport that the group has delivered \u201cseveral recommendations and guidance to WADA but not the final ones yet.\u201d WADA has reservations about Faiss\u2019 study and pointed to the \u201ccomplexity of trying to measure [doping] prevalence,\u201d highlighting that reports have \u201cgreatly varying results.\u201d The anti-doping organization added: \u201cNo single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline.\u201d \u201cComparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system\u2019s testing figures isn\u2019t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence. \u201cIn any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries \u2013 it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others. \u201cThe Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures.\u201d Editor\u2019s note: You can find WADA\u2019s full statement at the bottom of this article.\u00a0 \u2018A dangerous clown show\u2019 Travis Tygart, the Chief Executive Officer at the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), told CNN Sport that the idea of an Enhanced Games is \u201cfarcical \u2026 likely illegal in many [US] states\u201d and \u201ca dangerous clown show, not real sport.\u201d Substances such as anabolic steroids \u2013 which help to build muscle mass by enabling athletes to train harder and recover quickly from strenuous workouts \u2013 are classified as a Schedule III drug by the US Drug Enforcement Administration. When asked whether anabolic steroids will be allowed at the games and whether athletes would be tested for illegal drugs such as cocaine, D\u2019Souza told CNN Sport that \u201cwe will not be drug testing at the games.\u201d He added: \u201cWe do not propose to regulate what athletes use.\u201d Anabolic steroids may be prescribed by a licensed physician for the treatment of certain conditions such as testosterone deficiency, but if used in the US without a prescription from a licensed physician, a first conviction could result in a one-year prison sentence and a $1,000 fine. But that isn\u2019t the only potential legal jeopardy the Enhanced Games faces, according to American lawyer Jim Walden, who represents Russian whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov. \u201cIf you look at the Enhanced Games website, it\u2019s almost as though they\u2019re advertising their disregard of the law,\u201d Walden told CNN Sport. \u201cThey wrap themselves up in what I will call the cloak of legitimacy by using phrases like body autonomy and coming out as an enhanced athlete. \u201cI hope they\u2019re thinking hard about how they\u2019re going to pull this off in the world in which the FBI has a specific unit that is called the Sports and Gaming Initiative that\u2019s focusing on these very issues.\u201d The Sports and Gaming Initiative was developed to \u201cprotect athletes and sporting institutions in the United States from criminal threats and influences,\u201d according to the government website. The initiative works in partnership with sports leagues and governing bodies, international law enforcement and independent watchdog groups to tackle crimes such as fraud, doping and match-fixing; criminal activities, it says, \u201cdegrade the integrity of sports and competition and erode public confidence in these cherished institutions.\u201d \u201cThe use of doping substances is not acceptable in modern sports,\u201d Rodchenkov said in his written comments to CNN. \u201cPromotion and advertising of banned substances is against sport rules and moral, letter and spirit. \u201cIt might bring an extreme harm to young generation[s] of athletes who mistakenly could believe in benefits of [the] Enhanced Games.\u201d Rodchenkov, the protagonist of the Oscar-winning Netflix documentary Icarus who is currently under FBI protection, also believes that the Enhanced Games\u2019 organizers \u201cmight get investigated [\u2026] under the Rodchenkov Act.\u201d The Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act, named after the whistleblower, allows the US to impose criminal sanctions on individuals involved in doping activities at international events. However, the Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act does not apply to sporting events that don\u2019t adopt the WADA code, which the Enhanced Games wouldn\u2019t do. Rodchenkov also added that WADA athletes could not have any affiliation or contact with so-called enhanced athletes, or they would risk being charged under Article 2.10 \u2013 \u201cProhibited Association by an Athlete or Other Person\u201d \u2013 of the World Anti-Doping Code. USADA\u2019s Tygart also told CNN Sport: \u201cNo one really wants our children growing up idolizing unbridled drug use in sport, even if some profiteers think otherwise.\u201d D\u2019Souza insists his motivation for founding the Enhanced Games isn\u2019t financial. If he had wanted to make more money, he says he\u2019d continue to be a \u201cquiet, mild-mannered venture capitalist.\u201d \u201cI do think fundamentally that consumers want this [the Enhanced Games] and athletes want this because if you go to the cinemas, no one\u2019s interested in histories in the past anymore,\u201d said D\u2019Souza. \u201cThey\u2019re interested in superheroes and technology in the future. And this is literally what we are bringing to a reality.\u201d \u2018The dirtiest Olympics in history\u2019 According to Pierre de Coubertin \u2013 the founder of the modern Olympics \u2013 \u201cfor every man, woman and child, it [sport] offers an opportunity for self-improvement.\u201d Except historically, many athletes competing in the Olympics have taken the idea of self-improvement too far, notably at London 2012, which Rodchenkov has previously called \u201cthe dirtiest Olympics in history.\u201d When the ITA concluded its re-analysis program for the London Games, it found 73 anti-doping rule violations, which led to the withdrawal of 31 medals and reallocation of 46 Olympic medals across the sports of athletics, weightlifting, wrestling and canoeing. Doping has been an issue at the Olympics throughout the event\u2019s history, and the 100-meter final at the 1988 Games has become one of the most infamous and controversial moments in sporting history. Six of the eight finalists \u2013 notably the winner, Ben Johnson \u2013 who lined up on that September day in Seoul 35 years ago would fail drug tests themselves or be implicated in drug use during their careers. Despite some athletes continuing to cheat, global antidoping efforts remain ever-present, according to the testers. Recent out-of-competition (OOC) testing data published by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) highlights positive results from steps being taken to keep \u201celite podiums and finals clean,\u201d according to the anti-doping organization. Data focused on OOC testing ahead of last year\u2019s World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon, shows how resources and testing are targeting those athletes most likely to win medals and make finals. Whilst only 39% of the athletes in Eugene had three or more OOC tests in the 10 months leading up the event, 81% of top-eight finishers had three or more OOC tests. Yet the cat and mouse game between testers and athletes using banned substances continues. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly about the question of timing and targeting the right athletes,\u201d said Faiss. Given that athletes have their blood values regularly monitored, it is \u201cgetting more difficult for athletes to use high doses [of drugs such as EPO], but they would still be using micro dosing.\u201d By taking EPO late at night and drinking enough water, the substance would not be detected in athletes the following morning, according to Faiss, though athletes suspected of blood doping could be tested in the middle of the night. \u201cAthletes are actually getting back to very simple ways of doping with steroids,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cEPO is quite simple to use, but still tricky to detect.\u201d Athletes \u201cuse the drugs that are actively working.\u201d When it comes to new substances such as Roxadustat \u2013 the drug that two-time grand slam champion Simona Halep has recently been given a four-year ban for taking, although she denies ever knowingly or intentionally taking any prohibited substance \u2013 Faiss said athletes \u201care likely to use substances with a very short half-life in [the] body that are mimicking processes of the oxygen carrying improvements through the EPO channels.\u201d Roxadustat has an elimination half-life of 10-16 hours, according to the National Institutes of Health. Athletes are \u201cseeking to find substances where the [half-life] time window is very short, to make sure that if they are not tested at the right moment, they won\u2019t be caught,\u201d said Faiss. \u2018Challenge for sporting competition\u2019 Michele Verroken, the founding director of consultancy group Sporting Integrity, believes an antidoping system is required that will \u201cgive a lot more credibility, a lot more immediacy to verifying results, if we\u2019re going to keep the hearts and minds of athletes.\u201d Verroken also questions what\u2019s stopping an athlete from cheating if they only get caught 10 years after the event, or not at all. Under the World Anti-Doping Code, there is a 10-year statute of limitations on samples taken from 2015 onwards. Verroken told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games is \u201csetting a really interesting challenge for sporting competition.\u201d Not unsurprisingly, many sporting bodies have condemned the event. The Australian Olympic Committee called it \u201cdangerous and irresponsible,\u201d saying that \u201cthe world needs better than this.\u201d UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) said it \u201cis extremely concerned by the concept of an Enhanced Games,\u201d adding that \u201cthere is no place in sport for performance enhancing drugs, nor the Enhanced Games.\u201d UKAD\u2019s Director of Operations, Hamish Coffey, told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games sets a \u201chugely dangerous precedent,\u201d expressing concern over the kind of messaging the event sends to the next generation of athletes. \u2018Very accomplished athletes\u2019 When CNN Sport spoke to D\u2019Souza shortly after the proposed event\u2019s announcement, he said that 368 athletes had enquired about the Enhanced Games and more had messaged via social media. The organization\u2019s Chief Athletes Officer and former Olympian Brett Fraser, who swam for the Cayman Islands at three Olympic Games, told CNN Sport that \u201cvery accomplished athletes\u201d at the level of Olympic finalists have reached out \u201cto understand more about how the first Games will take place and how they can become involved.\u201d Fraser added that Enhanced Games organizers \u201calready have an Olympic medallist\u201d for their athlete commission, though he didn\u2019t specify who that was. He also said there has been \u201ca lot of positive feedback and a lot of acceptance and excitement from younger generations.\u201d Nonetheless, none of the athletes appear prepared to speak publicly at this stage. For those who do want to compete, the Enhanced Games would be an annual event with five categories \u2013 track and field, swimming, weightlifting, gymnastics and martial arts. The huge cost of hosting an Olympic Games is no secret, with countries often striving to create bigger and better spectacles by blowing their budget. Tokyo 2021 had the largest Olympic sports program in history, with 33 sports competitions in 42 venues culminating in 339 medal events. The Covid-impacted Games were delivered with a final expenditure of $13 billion \u2013 almost double the $7.3 billion that was originally forecast. Meanwhile, keeping the IOC\u2019s philosophy of \u201clower-impact Games\u201d in mind, 95% of venues will be pre-existing facilities at the Paris 2024 Olympics. D\u2019Souza said the Enhanced Games will focus on fewer sports, reuse existing infrastructure and fund the event through the private sector to \u201cdeliver a high-impact yet cost-efficient games\u201d so profits can be shared with the athletes. He added that the Enhanced Games is looking for a seven-figure prize pool for any athlete potentially breaking Usain Bolt\u2019s 100-meter world record of 9.58 seconds. \u201cI\u2019ve had conversations with people who are top-10 sprinters in the world who are going to the next Olympics, and they said [\u2026] if there\u2019s a million-dollar prize to break the 100m world record, I\u2019ll be there,\u201d said D\u2019Souza. Universal basic income and mental health support to athletes will also be part of an \u201cenhanced athletes programme.\u201d When asked who would take responsibility if an athlete competing at the Enhanced Games were to suffer fatal consequences, D\u2019Souza told CNN Sport that \u201cour athletes at the games will be the most monitored athletes in history.\u201d He said: \u201cWe will focus on athlete safety by mandating athletes have pre-competition full-system clinical screenings including blood tests and EKGs.\u201d \u201cThis will ensure that athletes are healthy to complete and not at risk of major health complications.\u201d D\u2019Souza also said that athletes will sign waivers in order\u00a0to compete. As it stands, no venues are officially in place to host the event and D\u2019Souza admits its scale will be dependent on funding and media partnerships. \u201cWe\u2019re in commercial negotiations with venues and media partners at the moment,\u201d added D\u2019Souza, who said the first Enhanced Games will be at a university campus or a similar facility in the south of the US and that a number of trademarks have been filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. \u2018Undermine the very purpose of sport\u2019 Elite performance coach Trevor Painter, who has worked with a number of Olympic and international sprinters and middle-distance runners, said he would \u201cnever\u201d coach an athlete taking performance-enhancing drugs because it would go against his morals as a coach. \u201cHaving been involved with many athletes that have lost in many ways to the cheats, I won\u2019t be engaging with [the Enhanced Games],\u201d Painter told CNN Sport. If it goes ahead as planned in December 2024, D\u2019Souza insists that the Enhanced Games will unlock the potential of humanity. But according to John William Devine, Senior Lecturer in Ethics, Sport and Exercise Sciences at Swansea University in Wales, the Enhanced Games will make sporting competition more unfair than it already is and even \u201cundermine the very purpose of the sport in question.\u201d Devine told CNN Sport that \u201cperformance-enhancing drugs don\u2019t actually lead to better athletic performance. They obscure athletic performance.\u201d He added that, although the Enhanced Games may look very similar to the Olympics, the nature of the activity will be different, raising the question: \u201cTo what extent is drug-assisted performance reflective of the athletes\u2019 sporting excellence?\u201d WADA response in full: Determining the level of prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed. That is why we set up a\u00a0Working Group on Doping Prevalence\u00a0in 2017. Measuring doping prevalence is a difficult and complex process. Through its work, the group found a huge variance across the many prevalence studies that have been carried out, leading it to publish guidelines on how to improve the quality of measuring prevalence. WADA is currently developing a tool that Anti-Doping Organizations can use to evaluate the effectiveness of their programs. WADA is well aware of the [Faiss] study. Indeed, one of the contributors, Prof. Martial Saugy, is a member of the Working Group. This study is one of many that helps to inform the Group\u2019s work. It is a very narrow study. It looks at two events, in a single sport, held 10 and 12 years ago, using just one method of measurement (the Athlete Biological Passport (ABP)). As far as I am aware, there is no comparable data from more recent World Championships in the same sport. Given its limited scope, it is important that this study be analyzed within the wider context of other studies and not be taken in isolation. This study also highlights the complexity of trying to measure prevalence. It is the third published paper that sought to measure prevalence at the 2011 Athletics World Championships. Each reported greatly varying results. The fact is no single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline. Results will always come with caveats and margins of error and will be based on a variety of methods, including self-report questionnaires, analytical methods (like ABP and testing data) and other methods to give a more rounded estimate of what the most likely figure would be. Comparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system\u2019s testing figures isn\u2019t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence. In any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries \u2013 it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others. The Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/10/30/sport/enhanced-games-olympics-doping-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2023_09_20_sport_saudi-arabia-soccer-spl-bin-salman-intl-spt-cmd-dg", "text": "When Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal reportedly planned a $1.1 billion bid to sign French soccer superstar Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 \u2013 including $332 million to his club, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), and an eye-watering $775 million salary packet to the World Cup winner for just one year \u2013 it was slammed by critics as sportswashing. Mbapp\u00e9 might have said no to the offer in July, but a month later, Neymar Jr. said yes to Al-Hilal, as the Brazil star moved from PSG for a transfer fee of around $98.5 million (\u20ac90 million) plus add-ons, according to multiple reports. In a record-breaking transfer window, Saudi Pro League (SPL) clubs spent close to $1 billion, acquiring 94 overseas players from Europe\u2019s major leagues \u2013 France\u2019s Ligue 1, Spain\u2019s La Liga, Italy\u2019s Serie A, Germany\u2019s Bundesliga and the English Premier League \u2013 according to Deloitte. Despite the Arab nation\u2019s poor human rights record, Saudi Arabia\u2019s spending spree to turn its domestic soccer league into a star-studded, bona fide competition shows the seriousness of its ambition. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman says he doesn\u2019t \u201ccare\u201d about the country\u2019s investment in sport being described as sportswashing. \u201cWell if sportswashing is going to increase my GDP by one percent, then I will continue doing sportswashing,\u201d MBS said in an\u00a0interview\u00a0with Fox News which aired Wednesday. Pressed on if he was bothered by the use of the term, MBS continued: \u201cI don\u2019t care. I have one percent GDP growth from sport, and I am aiming for another one and a half percent. Call it whatever you want, we\u2019re going to get that one and a half percent.\u201d Saudi clubs, several of which have been taken over by the nation\u2019s sovereign Public Investment Fund (PIF), have already attracted some of the biggest names in the sport. By attracting some of the world\u2019s biggest stars to the Gulf states, the SPL wants \u201cto drive competitiveness on and off the pitch,\u201d though it\u2019s keen to emphasize that these overseas players will help develop \u201cyoung Saudi talent.\u201d During this summer transfer window, the government-controlled PIF increased the cumulative value of these four clubs nearly five times, making them the most valuable in the country, according to estimates by the sports website Transfermarkt. Plenty of other leading stars have eagerly said yes to the SPL, notably 2022 Ballon D\u2019Or winner Karim Benzema joining Al-Ittihad at the end of his contract with Spanish soccer giant Real Madrid. As the European transfer window came to a close, the four PIF-owned teams have spent nearly $900 million (\u20ac835.1 million) on buying elite international players, Transfermarkt data shows, which ranked them in the top 20 clubs in the world by transfer expenditure, alongside soccer giants from England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy. Al Hilal alone paid more than $378 million (\u20ac353 million), more than PSG and Arsenal, making it the second-largest spender this year. The newly acquired players join five-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, who has a two-year contract with Al-Nassr where he will earn a staggering estimated $200 million a year, according to Saudi state-owned media, currently making him the world\u2019s highest paid soccer player. As of today, 21 of the most expensive soccer players in Saudi Arabia by transfer fees \u2013 all international stars \u2013 play for one of the PIF-owned clubs. Despite the financial outlay, the SPL is remaining deliberately tight-lipped about the specifics of its financial gamble, with chief operating officer Carlo Nohra confirming to CNN Sport that it was \u201cnot in [the SPL\u2019s] competitive advantage\u201d to report the salaries offered to players and coaches. The PIF has $777 billion in assets under management, according to its most recent filing, with ambitions to top $1 trillion within a few years. In 2021, it acquired English soccer club Newcastle United, before focusing on investments at home. The club is now also among top spenders on players. Saudi clubs not owned by the PIF are also splurging on big-ticket players, with former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson, 33, offered an eye-watering salary of $870,000 (\u00a3700,000) per week, according to multiple reports, in an estimated $15 million (\u00a312 million) transfer from Liverpool to Saudi team Al-Ettifaq. In a recent interview with The Athletic, Henderson said those numbers \u201cjust aren\u2019t true.\u201d \u201cEssentially, the signal is \u2018We mean business,\u2019\u201d Simon Chadwick, a professor of sport and geopolitical economy at SKEMA Business School, told CNN.\u201cWe\u2019ve got so much money that for a player who is \u2026 coming towards the end of his career, we can afford to pay him 700,000 [GB pounds a week], or whatever it is that he\u2019s being paid, and still have Cristiano Ronaldo and still be in the market for other players as well,\u201d Chadwick said, describing Saudi\u2019s approach to becoming a sporting superpower, adding that the sky is the limit in terms of cost. Saudi\u2019s love of soccer Saudi Arabia follows in the footsteps of several other countries \u2013 including China and Qatar in investing large sums of money to try and turn themselves into soccer powerhouses. It remains to be seen whether Saudi\u2019s turbocharged investment will have a lasting impact or resemble something like a costly rebranding effort. The Saudi national team has been to multiple World Cups, and the country\u2019s clubs have won multiple Asian titles. Saudi\u2019s victory over Argentina during last year\u2019s men\u2019s World Cup was hailed as one of the greatest upsets in tournament history, with the country\u2019s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud granting a national public holiday in recognition of the win. Club games can attract huge crowds in the Middle Eastern nation. \u201cFor example, Al-Ittihad against Al-Hilal, you\u2019re talking about drawing crowds of 40, 50, 60,000 people, these are games that are comparable in size to Chelsea vs. Arsenal, Manchester United vs. Manchester City,\u201d Chadwick said. Buying star players, some arguably past their prime, also provides an easy win for Saudi teams, according to Kieran Maguire, co-host of \u201cThe Price of Football\u201d podcast. \u201cFrom the Saudi authorities\u2019 point of view, they\u2019re getting a ready-made product. Everybody\u2019s heard of Benzema. Everybody\u2019s heard of Cristiano Ronaldo and so on,\u201d Maguire said. Saudi Arabia\u2019s lofty sporting ambitions don\u2019t end with the SPL or Newcastle United. The country is hosting the 2023 FIFA Club World Cup and is bidding to host the 2027 AFC Asian Cup. Several media reports also indicated that the Gulf kingdom was considering launching a bid for the 2030 FIFA men\u2019s World Cup alongside Greece and Egypt \u2013 although it is reportedly mulling pulling its candidacy. Meanwhile, the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) has agreed to a contract that will see the Spanish Super Cup played in Saudi Arabia until 2029, a deal that will earn the Spanish governing body between \u20ac35-45 million ($38-48 million) a year. Appealing to the youth Saudi Arabia has a very young population: the country\u2019s most recent census revealed 32.2 million people live in the country, nearly 42% of whom are foreign nationals \u2013 and 51% of the Saudi population are under the age of 30.\u202fOf this populace, Saudi authorities say that over 80% play, attend or follow soccer, the national sport. Chadwick explains that Saudi Arabia\u2019s government is concerned with the prospect of its younger members of society becoming radicalized or an anti-government sentiment bubbling up like that of the Arab Spring \u2013 and looks to offer its population a thriving soccer industry to keep it placated. Though the soccer industry generates employment, revenues, export earnings and inward investment, \u201cwhat is just as significant is the security of the royal family,\u201d Chadwick adds. The Arab Spring, a wave of pro-democracy protests that washed over the Middle East and North Africa in 2011, achieved mixed results. Four Arab dictators in Libya, Yemen, Egypt and Tunisia were toppled, offering a brief sense of victory for protesters, but, since then, new wars have prompted a retreat of popular movements in the region. Meanwhile, failed uprisings in Bahrain and eastern Saudi Arabia were followed by years-long crackdowns and a continuing civil war in Syria. \u201cWhat we\u2019re beginning to see in Saudi Arabia right now is the emergence of a new social contract. And the social contract essentially is catering for the needs of the Gen Z population,\u201d Chadwick said. \u201cYou want Ronaldo? You got him. You want some of the best football teams in the world? You got them. You want the World Cup to come to Saudi Arabia? You got it \u2026 But don\u2019t question us,\u201d Chadwick explained. Maguire agrees, noting that investing in soccer \u201ccan be seen as part of a much broader socio-economic plan, run by the Saudi authorities.\u201d At the same time, there has been \u201ca significant increase in the number of Saudi Arabians detained by the authorities, for example, for posting adverse comments on social media about the country\u201d this year, Chadwick told CNN. Human rights group Amnesty International told CNN that it has documented a rollback in human rights in Saudi Arabia, including an escalating crackdown on freedom of expression and an increased use of counterterrorism and cybercrime laws to silence dissent. Between 2022 and 2023, the organization said it has documented an increase in criminal prosecutions compared to previous years. In 2022, Amnesty reported the highest number of annual executions in the country in 30 years, with 196 people killed. \u201cReputation is important in terms of attracting foreign investment, and \u2026 Mohammed bin Salman, as much as he has significant financial muscle, needs foreign investing for the realization of his diversification,\u201d James Dorsey, the author of the syndicated column and blog, \u201cThe Turbulent World of Middle East Soccer,\u201d explains. Saudi Arabia is the world\u2019s biggest exporter of crude oil, and nearly two-thirds of its income still comes from selling fossil fuels. But with oil prices regularly dipping below what the Gulf state needs to balance its budget, it has focused efforts on trying to bring in investment from abroad along with its efforts to raise oil prices. Projections indicate the kingdom has around 20 years to diversify its economy to ensure it is more resilient, according to Chadwick \u2013 not least to fund its Vision 2030 projects, including the $500 billion Neom city, a 106 mile-long linear city called The Line and a futuristic plan to revamp the capital. \u201cPart of the grand vision of Mohammed bin Salman, looking forward to 2030, he does have his desire to make Saudi Arabia less dependent on natural resources to look at a post-fuel economy [involving] tourism, entertainment. If Saudi Arabia can become a hub for major sporting events, then that\u2019s a way of attracting interest to the country,\u201d said Maguire. CNN has reached out to the Saudi Ministry of Sport for comment on allegations that the kingdom has been rolling back human rights, and investing in soccer as a way of \u201csportswashing\u201d its image. In response to previous criticism about Saudi Arabia\u2019s purported \u201csportswashing,\u201d the kingdom\u2019s sports minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal said: \u201cPeople that don\u2019t know Saudi Arabia, have never been to Saudi Arabia, go out and talk about it as if they\u2019ve lived there for 30 years, 40 years. So I always tell people, come to Saudi. Come and see Saudi. \u201cSee what it is, see the people, meet the people. Look at what the country is doing for the future of the people in Saudi, then you can criticize as much as you like,\u201d he added. Lack of transparency: Saudi threatens new systems of governance\u202fin sports Saudi Arabia has already disrupted the golf industry and, with soccer, Maguire told CNN, \u201cthey feel that they can do that probably on a smaller scale, but perhaps, ultimately, to generate more interest in terms of eyeballs if they go down the same route.\u201d In 2021, the Saudi government-controlled PIF bankrolled LIV Golf, reportedly at a cost of $2 billion, attracting many of the sport\u2019s top players away from the US-based PGA Tour and Europe-based DP World Tour by offering big dollar prize money, with PGA Tour board member Jimmy Dunne raising fears that they might end up \u201cowning golf.\u201d Earlier this year, the US-based PGA Tour announced it was set to partner with the Saudi-backed breakaway LIV Golf, ending a feud that has dogged the men\u2019s professional game for the past year, with Dunne warning that sport\u2019s governing body had no choice but to reach the truce to retain some measure of control. \u201cThey have an unlimited horizon and an unlimited amount of money,\u201d he said at a contentious Senate hearing on the truce between the two tours. When it comes to soccer, Aleksander Ceferin, president of European football\u2019s governing body UEFA, has dismissed the competitive threat that the SPL could pose. \u201cAs far as I know, Mbappe and [Erling] Haaland don\u2019t dream of Saudi Arabia. I don\u2019t believe that the best players at the pinnacle of their careers would go to Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said last month. \u201cWhen people talk to me about the players who went there, nobody knows where they\u2019re playing.\u201d Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp took a different view, referring to the fact that the Saudi summer transfer window stays open after European clubs see theirs close: \u201cI don\u2019t know how stable it is and I think the next two weeks will show how much of a challenge it is because whatever happens there, no one can react anymore. \u201cI don\u2019t know where it will lead to but it feels rather like a threat or a concern than not because I can\u2019t see how we really deny it in these moments, what can we do?\u201d he added. Still, the new SPL director of football, Michael Emenalo, says what Saudi soccer is doing is \u201cno different from what the Premier League have done.\u201d \u201cThere was a time when it was all about Italy. There was a time when it was all about Spain. What we\u2019re looking for in the industry is an opportunity to compete, and to compete on an even scale and to improve upon whatever exists in the industry,\u201d said Emenalo in a press release sent to CNN. New Saudi Pro League Chief Operating Officer Carlo Nohra told CNN that there is logic behind the league\u2019s strategy of money is no object to lure international stars. \u201cWe can\u2019t expect to be paying market value to entice people to come here at this early stage in our development.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0But analysts say that the difference lies in the level of transparency, which \u201csimply doesn\u2019t exist in Saudi Arabia,\u201d Chadwick explained to CNN. European soccer governing body UEFA has financial fair play (FFP) rules on teams\u2019 spending, while Major League Soccer in the US has a salary cap for its clubs. Nohra told CNN that, eventually, the country wants 0.3% of its GDP to be from soccer to make it similar to that of the Premier League on the UK economy \u2013 up from its current value of \u201c0.000 something.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve got no chance to get into that figure at present,\u201d Maguire explained, but added that the SPL could perhaps move into the top 10 of the world\u2019s domestic leagues. \u201cThat is feasible given the amount of money that they\u2019re spending.\u201d \u201cI think they\u2019re realistic. They don\u2019t say that they\u2019re going to overtake La Liga or the Premier League or the major European leagues,\u201d Maguire said. When the Peterson Institute for International Economics compared the world\u2019s sovereign wealth funds on criteria including governance, transparency and accountability in 2019, the PIF scored well below average on a measure combining these criteria, and ranked in the bottom 10 out of 64 funds, just above Russian Direct Investment Fund. CNN has reached out to the PIF for further comment about its investments in sport, particularly soccer and golf, and criticisms about its lack of transparency. Chadwick raised concerns over how a lack of financial rules affecting Saudi clubs might dilute UEFA\u2019s FFP regulations, as well as those of the Premier League, or impact world soccer governing body FIFA\u2019s systems of governance. The lack of transparency in Saudi Arabia\u2019s wealth fund has already raised suspicions in the US golfing and political spheres. Earlier this summer, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations launched an inquiry about the PGA Tour\u2019s agreement with the PIF-controlled LIV Golf. Chadwick told CNN that, so long as there is no independent organization that monitors the reporting of every league\u2019s financial endeavors, \u201cnobody really knows for sure what the accurate financial information is.\u201d \u201cThis vacuum [of information], this uncertainty is wrapped in a veneer of lobbying, which is intended to either overinflate or underinflate player transfer values and salary information because it serves a political purpose,\u201d Chadwick says, adding that this purpose is \u201csignaling.\u201d \u201cIt is almost as though football players are becoming kind of geopolitical pawns in some ways.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/09/20/sport/saudi-arabia-soccer-spl-bin-salman-intl-spt-cmd-dg/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_12_sport_oscar-pistorius-cnn-documentary-spt-intl", "text": "On May 12, the CNN series \u201cHow it Really Happened\u201d will explore the life of Oscar Pistorius, the double-amputee Paralympic and Olympic sprinter who was convicted in the murder of his girlfriend, South African model Reeva Steenkamp, more than a decade ago. Known as the \u201cBlade Runner\u201d for his carbon-fiber prosthetics, Pistorius was once heralded as an inspirational figure At the 2012 London Games, he became the first Paralympian to compete at an Olympics and during his successful track career won eight Paralympic medals, six of them gold. He was in his athletic prime when, on February 14, 2013, he killed Steenkamp. \u201cIf you take the celebrity of LeBron James and you combined it with the appeal of Leonardo DiCaprio, that was what Oscar Pistorius was,\u201d said Scott Roder, a crime scene reconstruction expert who worked on the case, in CNN\u2019s documentary, hosted by Jesse L. Martin. The documentary features footage from the court in Pretoria, South Africa, during Pistorius\u2019s 2013 murder trial and 2023 parole hearing and original interviews with Steenkamp\u2019s mother, modeling agent and family attorney. Pistorius shot Steenkamp four times through the bathroom door of his house. In a trial that garnered global attention, he denied killing her in a fit of anger and instead said he had mistaken her for an intruder. He pleaded not guilty to one charge of murder and a firearms charge associated with Steenkamp\u2019s killing. He was initially convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to five years in prison before that conviction was overturned and upgraded to murder, increasing his sentence to six years. In 2017, his sentence was increased to 13 years and five months by South Africa\u2019s Supreme Court of Appeal. The documentary examines the details leading to Steenkamp\u2019s murder \u2013 including disagreements between the couple shared over WhatsApp and the athlete\u2019s \u201cobsession\u201d with firearms, though his motives remain unknown to this day. \u201cWhy would he kill her? Why did he do it?\u201d Steenkamp\u2019s mother, June, asked in the documentary. She called Pistorius\u2019 version of events \u201cabsolute rubbish and lies\u201d and spoke candidly about the pain she felt on that night in 2013. She recalled the moment she was told that her daughter had died, describing it as \u201cthe worst day of my life.\u201d \u201cI was hysterical,\u201d she said. \u201cI just wanted to die myself, honestly. I didn\u2019t want to live without her.\u201d The documentary sheds light on the whirlwind romance between the couple and the life of Steenkamp, described by her mother as \u201ca blessing, a gift from God. Very clever, and she was always laughing.\u201d \u201cShe would have done amazing things,\u201d said Tania Koen, CEO of the Reeva Steenkamp Foundation. \u201cAnd she was so kind and passionate and compassionate. The world was a better place with Reeva in it.\u201d Pistorius, now 37 years old, was released on parole on January 5 this year. A parole board granted his petition in November on the grounds that he had served half of his 13-year sentence for murdering Steenkamp, making him eligible according to South African law. He has kept a low profile since his release, but the conditions of his parole include restrictions on his movements, mandatory classes on gender-based violence, anger management therapy, no alcohol and he\u2019s not allowed to speak to the media. Steenkamp\u2019s mother has been vocal in her criticism of his release and expressed her concern for the safety of other women. \u201cAt this time, I am not convinced that Oscar has been rehabilitated,\u201d she said in a victim impact statement in November 2023. \u201cRehabilitation requires someone to engage honestly with the full truth of his crime and the consequences thereof. Nobody can claim to have remorse if they are not able to engage fully with the truth. \u201cIf someone does not show remorse, they cannot be considered to be rehabilitated. If they are not rehabilitated, their risk of recidivism is high.\u201d \u201cOscar Pistorius: The Bladerunner\u201d airs on CNN on Sunday, May 12 at 9 p.m. ET/PT", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/sport/oscar-pistorius-cnn-documentary-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_01_sport_beth-rodden-climber-trauma-intl-spt", "text": "Weeks after being taken hostage by captors from the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, American climber Beth Rodden was back home \u2013 but plagued by nightmares of her ordeal. Then 20, and one of the most revered climbers of her generation, Rodden was kidnapped at gunpoint alongside her then boyfriend, Tommy Caldwell, and two other climbers while on a climbing trip in Kyrgyzstan in 2000. The ordeal lasted for six days, with the young group forced to drink water from murky puddles and survive on a few energy bars as they were marched through the cold, wet mountain terrain, sleeping under boulders as their guards evaded capture. The team endured the horror of a fellow captive \u2013 a young Kyrgyz soldier who had also been taken \u2013 being shot dead nearby by the captors, who were part of the militant group which was based in Tajikistan and focused on a bloody incursion into Kyrgyzstan at the time. Rodden, the only woman in the group, also feared sexual assault and had the added horror of knowing that one of her captors regularly masturbated within close proximity to her. Eventually, after their captors split up to resupply, the American group managed to escape after Caldwell pushed their single remaining guard off a cliff, which the team presumed killed him. They later discovered the guard survived. On their return to the US, Rodden was baffled to find that people within the climbing community were inclined to \u201ccelebrate\u201d their ordeal. \u201cWhen we came back instead of people asking, \u2018Are you OK? How are you doing?\u2019 it was more celebrated because a lot of climbing and climbing stories back then were all about skirting death and having a harrowing tale to go along with it. And obviously, this was a harrowing tale,\u201d Rodden tells CNN Sport 24 years on from the incident. \u201cSo when people kind of celebrated it, I didn\u2019t really have language to talk about how I was being affected,\u201d Rodden, a decorated and revered climber, whose resume includes three free ascents of Yosemite\u2019s monolith, El Capitan, as well as establishing some of climbing\u2019s hardest routes, adds. Rodden struggled with insomnia and nightmares, and although she went to a few therapy sessions she says she didn\u2019t really open up. \u201cI was honestly a bit embarrassed that I wasn\u2019t just getting back up on that horse easily,\u201d Rodden, who has completed some of the world\u2019s toughest big wall climbs, tells CNN. \u201cEarly on there wasn\u2019t much room for any conversations about fear. It was seen as a weakness. \u201cIf you said that you were scared of heights or scared of a climb or something like that, it was really seen as a weakness. I don\u2019t know if that really served me well because it\u2019s not like I actually worked on or understood my fear at all. I just kind of shoved it down,\u201d she explains. As she got older, this approach no longer worked for her. \u201cI started to just try and talk about things that I had struggled with, you know, and really shed a light on that and once I started to do that, a lot of people reached out and said, \u2018Oh, I feel that way too.\u2019 \u201cWhen I was a teenager, instead of just reading the shiny, packaged, typical hero\u2019s journey, if I had read a book that kind of showed all the nuance and all the messiness of people\u2019s worlds, it would have given me a little bit of comfort away from perfectionism,\u201d she explains. Rodden reflects on her experiences in her new book, \u201cA Light Through The Cracks,\u201d which releases May 1. \u2018A more inclusive community\u2019 Although Rodden was a high achiever following her return to the US, scaling some of what are still considered to be the hardest routes in climbing, the trauma of the incident remained. She married and later she and Caldwell divorced. And, by her own admission, she struggled with feelings of guilt, fear and inadequacy. It\u2019s also clear that the sport which has given her so much has also taken a toll on Rodden, who says she has struggled with eating issues and a warped self-image for most of her career. \u201cI had heroes and mentors who helped me \u2013 they lost weight before competitions, commented on food that I was eating. I remember this one [time] where I ordered two bagels and cream cheese and they said \u2018You\u2019re never gonna get up anything if you eat that.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t direct, like, \u2018You\u2019re fat.\u2019 \u201cBut there was just all this background noise and chatter and conversations that clearly led me to believe that being skinny, unhealthily so, was the way to be a good climber and to gain sponsorships and be in magazines.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t see it as a problem because I just saw it as a tool that let me achieve.\u201d However, with conversations around mental health, body image and trauma becoming more common and accepted in the climbing world, Rodden says things are changing for the better. She tells CNN that therapy has helped her recovery. \u201cAt one point, I thought healing from trauma would be a box I checked, that I would cross a finish line at some point. But for me, I\u2019m realizing it\u2019s an ongoing thing in my life, it ebbs and flows, and I now think it\u2019ll be something that I come back to again and again,\u201d she explains. Rodden also reflects that the climbing community feels like a more inclusive space than it was decades ago. \u201cThere\u2019s become more room for people like mothers to be climbing, or people that are not just 20, you know? People that are postmenopausal that are older, younger \u2013 I feel like it\u2019s just becoming a more inclusive, well-rounded community,\u201d she added. \u201cI feel like I was really proud of free climbing El Cap a few times and some of the first ascents that I did in Yosemite and Smith Rock [in Oregon]. It\u2019s taken me a long time to look back and appreciate that, because when you\u2019re in the moment, you\u2019re like, \u201cThis is just what I do. And I\u2019m just barreling ahead and ticking things off.\u201d \u201cBut now looking back, I\u2019m like, Oh, that was that was like pretty cool.\u201d Having climbed for 30 years, the magic hasn\u2019t worn off yet, and Rodden hopes to be climbing for decades more. \u201cAny day I can go climbing, that gets me excited.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/01/sport/beth-rodden-climber-trauma-intl-spt/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_sport_chris-birch-nasa-astronaut-cycling-spt-scn-intl", "text": "Scroll through the athlete profiles on the USA Cycling website and you\u2019ll find someone whose favorite movie is listed as \u201cInterstellar\u201d \u2013 Christopher Nolan\u2019s acclaimed sci-fi adventure released in 2014. \u201cI love realistic space movies \u2026 I\u2019m definitely a nerd,\u201d reads Chris Birch\u2019s answer on her profile page. That response proved prescient: shortly after stepping away from her professional cycling career, the Arizona native was selected from more than 12,000 applicants to join NASA\u2019s astronaut class of 2021. As career sidesteps go, it was an unusual one, though Birch had an extensive background in science with degrees in mathematics, biochemistry and molecular biophysics, and a doctorate in biological engineering. The further she progressed with her application to join NASA, the more convinced she became that she had a future in spaceflight. Interviews with panels of current and former astronauts, she thought, were stimulating, not intimidating, and so too were the selection exercises undertaken with other candidates. \u201cI really just had a blast,\u201d Birch tells CNN Sport. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like an interview at all, it didn\u2019t feel like a test. It was just super fun. And it felt like fun and games for me.\u201d It\u2019s now been close to two and a half years since Birch joined NASA, and in that time, she has practiced for space walks, learned to fly T-38 training jets and developed skills needed to operate the robotic arm on the International Space Station. Her training also involved acquiring expeditionary skills, understanding how to operate the complex systems on the space station, and even becoming proficient in Russian, the language needed to fly the Soyuz spacecraft. When she graduated at Houston\u2019s Johnson Space Center in March, the 37-year-old had few qualms about the unexpected U-turn her career had taken, her appetite for spaceflight keener than ever before. \u201cI absolutely would love to explore off this planet,\u201d says Birch. \u201cI think there\u2019s a pretty good shot that I\u2019ll get to go do science aboard the International Space Station, maybe even get to do some wrenching outside and work on making some upgrades. \u201cIt would be an absolute career highlight to be able to go back to the moon as part of one of the Artemis missions and do science on the moon.\u201d Birch left academia in 2018 to pursue a career in professional cycling, going on to win 11 national titles and represent the US at the world championships on several occasions. It was around the time that she was training to make the team for the postponed Tokyo Olympics that Birch applied to join NASA, and when she missed out on selection for the Games, she decided to throw herself wholly into her new pursuit. Despite the evident differences in cycling and spaceflight, she believes that the same sense of curiosity and wonder has motivated her in both disciplines. \u201cI think there\u2019s something really powerful about being surrounded by a group of people that are all trying deliberately to not walk the path most trodden,\u201d says Birch. \u201cWe\u2019re all looking to push the envelope in some way, and that has always been my driving mantra. The whole reason I pursued a PhD is I wanted to discover something, to build something that had never been done before. \u201cMy fascination with sport was all about seeing how fast we could go. Can we push the human body \u2013 my body, my mind \u2013 farther than I thought I could go? It really was a natural extension of that inner drive for me, if not a slight change in the technical topics.\u201d Joining NASA has meant that Birch\u2019s days of flying around a velodrome at lightning-bolt speeds are over, but her desire to test her physical limits remains. She has turned her focus towards endurance challenges, completing the iconic Leadville Trail 100 mountain bike race \u2013 a 100-mile course with 12,000 feet of elevation gain in Colorado \u2013 last year, as well as racing the Houston Marathon in January. On her radar is an attempt to break the women\u2019s time record for cycling north to south across Montana, some 400 miles on gravel roads. Challenges like that are not so far removed from astronaut training, which involves group expeditions in the field, living in the wilderness for days at a time and learning how to handle stress in a critical, unforgiving environment. \u201cCycling in particular \u2013 it just supports so much suffering,\u201d says Birch. \u201cIt\u2019s a really great avenue to practice mental toughness. It doesn\u2019t cost much, versus for me to go out and fly in a multi-engine jet aircraft is thousands of dollars an hour. \u201cThis is something that I can go do and practice that toughness training, especially if I\u2019m descending on a mountain bike trail, six hours in and I\u2019m really tired \u2013 I\u2019m now making critical handling decisions in response to my environment. \u201cI feel like that translates really well to being able to do that in the jet \u2013 it\u2019s the same mental clarity, mental focus you have to maintain. I think it\u2019s an awesome space to practice that.\u201d Birch is now firmly focused on her first projects since graduating. Recently, that\u2019s involved supporting Artemis II recovery training in the Pacific Ocean, off the coast from California. The Artemis II mission, now scheduled for September 2025 after a delay of several months, aims to send four astronauts on a journey to fly by the moon, and being able to prepare for the safe recovery of the astronauts and the capsule, Birch says, gave an \u201cincredible appreciation for the needs of the crew,\u201d even while she\u2019s still a rookie. There\u2019s no obvious timeline or pathway for when or how she might be able to venture away from planet Earth herself, but it remains a firm ambition in her life and career. \u201cI\u2019m going to prepare for that the same way I would prepare for a race,\u201d says Birch, \u201cshow up every day and give 100% to the team. If the timing works out, then that\u2019s great. But I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/sport/chris-birch-nasa-astronaut-cycling-spt-scn-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "sports"}}

It was in his college sophomore year that Malek\u00a0says he\u00a0was introduced to an illegal bookkeeper. \u201cIt was definitely murky in terms of the legality and legitimacy of all of it, but I didn\u2019t really care,\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cI enjoyed betting with the bookies because I liked knowing that I was winning against a real person, that you know I was better than them.\u201d Malek vividly remembers his first $10 win. \u201cIt was a total warping of my mind,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Malek. \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing. This is easy, this is great.\u201d However, $10 bets became $100 wagers, which quickly morphed into stakes involving\u00a0thousands of dollars. \u201cWhen I really started losing and chasing the losses, I had an awareness that it was uncomfortable,\u201d admitted Malek. \u201cBut I think I was in such a mode of trying to solve everything that I didn\u2019t see it as really much of a problem.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until his parents noticed \u201csketchy people messaging him,\u201d and his school grades becoming an issue that Malek, who is now a public speaker on gambling awareness, knew he was in too deep. A \u2018massive explosion\u2019 It was in 2018 that the US Supreme Court struck down a 1992 federal law,\u00a0which had prohibited most states from allowing sports betting. Fast forward to 2024 and the gambling industry is engrained in US sports culture with leagues, franchises, players and networks now partnering with betting organizations. Nevada was the lone state able to provide sports betting in 2018, but it\u2019s now legal in 38 states and\u00a0the District of Columbia, with active legislation surrounding sports\u00a0betting\u00a0in a further six states. In February, when the Super Bowl was staged,\u00a0Americans bet $10.49 billion on sports, a 24.8% year-over-year increase,\u00a0according to the American Gaming Association\u2019s (AGA) gaming revenue tracker. Ahead of the Super Bowl, the AGA was predicting a record 67.8 million American adults (26%) would bet\u00a0an estimated $23.1 billion\u00a0on the event, a 35% increase from 2023. And, overall, nearly $120 billion in legal bets were made last year. \u201cIn America, as long as there have been sports to bet on, people have been betting on sports,\u201d AGA senior vice president Joe Maloney told CNN Sport in an interview. \u201cDemocrats and Republicans, if there\u2019s one thing that they could agree on, illegal betting was already happening.\u201d Maloney says the 2018 decision was an opportunity to bring betters into the legal marketplace\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and for politicians to\u00a0capture tax revenue. In 2023, more than $11 billion in state taxes were brought into state coffers. According to the US Census, New York state is by far the leader in taxes collected. \u201cThere was this rush by state government, quite frankly, to capitalize on gambling revenue and the gambling industry was happy to play along,\u201d Keith Whyte,\u00a0executive\u00a0director of the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG),\u00a0told\u00a0CNN Sport. The legal market It\u2019s estimated that 2.5 million adults in the US \u201cmeet the criteria for a severe gambling problem in a given year,\u201d according to the NCPG. Maloney maintains that one of the advantages of legalized sports gambling is the measures that are put in place to help those who suffer with gambling addictions. \u201cThe illegal market has flourished for probably four to five decades in this country \u2026 and there was never any problem gambling resources at any serious level to support those that are demonstrating problematic behavior,\u201d Maloney says. \u201cWe\u2019re really proud of the fact that \u2026 there\u2019s more money being devoted to problem gambling in this country than there ever has been.\u201d Whyte\u00a0says he\u00a0is less convinced. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen no evidence of that whatsoever,\u201d says Whyte when asked about legalized sports gambling helping curb gambling addiction. \u201cWe think the risk has gone up by about 30%.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m in the District of Columbia right now. The mayor recently cut every single penny of public funding to prevent and treat gambling problems. So right where the AGA and the National Council for Problem Gambling is located \u2013 the nation\u2019s capital \u2013 they abolished all public funds for problem gambling,\u201d adds Whyte. \u2018The pace of innovation\u2019 From LeBron James\u2019 NFL partnership with DraftKings to ESPN launching an official sportsbook, it is becoming increasingly hard to watch sport without gambling being part of the viewing experience. A 2023 NCAA study\u00a0surveyed young adults aged 18-22.\u00a0\u00a0It says that among those who had seen sports gambling advertisements, 52.8% said it made them more likely to want to gamble. Among higher risk gamblers as many as 80% say the ads they have seen make them more likely to gamble. Whyte says that these ads aren\u2019t too much of a concern if you\u2019re not in the higher risk groups but the connection among those who are is concerning. Maloney counters that advertising is crucial in taking gamblers from illegal to legal markets. \u201cAdvertising is very important upon markets being opened legally and regulated to communicate to betters that there is this opportunity to now bet in the legal market,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Maloney. The rise of advertisements and promotions is something that concerns NBA commissioner Adam Silver. \u201cI live in the New York market. It\u2019s constant in terms of promotions for people to bet on sports,\u201d said Silver recently. \u201cI worry also about young people. It\u2019s, of course, illegal for young people to bet on sports,\u201d added the commissioner. Ramon Zelaya, the moderator of Reddit\u2019s problem gambling forum, concurs. \u201cThe explosion of sports betting has captured the attention and engagement of younger gamblers. Folks starting in their teens,\u201d Zelaya told the NCPG. \u201cI\u2019ve had 16-year-olds post on the subreddit. I have noticed that the college age demographic tends to gravitate towards sports betting, online poker, trading cryptocurrency, that sort of thing.\u201d Despite Silver\u2019s hand-wringing over the proliferation of sports betting ads, the NBA in March said it had joined up with Sportradar to provide NBA League Pass users with the chance to look at live odds throughout games. \u201cWhere sports betting is legal, users can opt-in to have the convenience of viewing and selecting bets directly on NBA League Pass. When ready to place a bet, they are directed to FanDuel or DraftKings, the NBA\u2019s official betting partners, through a seamlessly embedded link,\u201d the Sportradar statement read. Malek believes that this lack of friction is dangerous. \u201cHaving it right there, really made it just so convenient that I was able to just click a button,\u201d he expained. Maloney, however, points to the opportunities technological innovation offers the betting industry and its customers. \u201cI think the pace of innovation right now, particularly as it relates to fan engagement and betting, and in play betting and live betting will continue to increase,\u201d said Maloney. \u201cI believe that the embrace with leagues, teams and industry partners will continue,\u201d he added. Whyte\u2019s concern is that most sports bettors \u201cwhen they get deep into in play [betting]\u201d have no idea of the true odds and that it\u2019s nigh impossible to calculate the true odds within the required 30 seconds you need to place an in-play bet. The betting industry also points to its continued emphasis on \u201cresponsible gambling,\u201d saying three quarters of what it describes as \u201ctraditional Super Bowl bettors\u201d report seeing a responsible gambling message in the last year, up from 71% in 2023. Sporting integrity Recently the NBA banned Toronto Raptors player Jontay Porter from the league after an investigation found that the 24-year-old had violated betting rules, the league said. The NBA said its investigation found that Porter had \u201cviolated league rules by disclosing confidential information to sports bettors, limiting his own participation in one or more games for betting purposes, and betting on NBA games.\u201d With the rise of sports gambling, this could become more common and it\u2019s something that NBA commissioner Silver is concerned by. \u201cIt\u2019s a cardinal sin, what he\u2019s accused of, in the NBA, and the ultimate extreme option I have is to ban him from the game,\u201d said Silver. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more serious, I think, around this league when it comes to gambling and betting on our games, and that is a direct player involvement,\u201d added Silver. Porter didn\u2019t respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment when his ban was announced. In late March, the NBA said it was \u201clooking into\u201d anomalies involving prop bets pertaining to Porter. Reportedly there were two specific games in which DraftKings Sportsbook flagged prop bets involving Porter in its daily betting insights. A DraftKings spokesperson told CNN after Porter was banned: \u201cWe have no comment on this story.\u00a0In general, it is important to note that one of the many benefits of legal and regulated sports betting is that sports betting operators identify and report suspicious activity and the integrity of sport is therefore protected in a manner that does not exist in the illegal market.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/03/sport/sports-betting-usa-impact-on-lives-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "sports"}}

For most people, growing up involves making choices, giving up on multiple dreams to concentrate all their energies on a single one, in the hope that perhaps just one, if they are lucky, can be realized. But Lauren Price never had to make that decision. At 12, she was a world kickboxing champion, a title she won another three times. Before she turned 18, she had already played soccer for Wales twice at senior level and another 50 times at under-16, under-17 and under-19 levels, where she captained her team. Soccer and kickboxing were ticked off the list. Then, watching female boxers fight in an Olympic ring for the first time at London 2012 inspired yet another goal for Price, and she took up the sport shortly afterwards, leaving soccer to focus on it. That was the sport that took her to the Olympic Games where, remarkably, she won a gold medal at Tokyo 2020 in the female middleweight division. And, on Saturday, she completed yet another milestone when she became Wales\u2019 first female world champion boxer as she defeated Jessica McCaskill by a unanimous technical decision after the fight in Cardiff, Wales was stopped early on medical advice to treat McCaskill\u2019s injured, swollen eye. \u201cThis is just the start,\u201d Price, now the WBA, IBO and Ring Magazine welterweight champion, told broadcaster Sky Sports afterwards. \u201cI want to build a legacy and create greatness \u2026 You see what Katie Taylor did for Ireland, I want to do the same for Wales.\u201d But, despite the seemingly seamless realization of all her childhood dreams, Price had to fight hard for them outside the ring as well as inside. When she initially began boxing, Price juggled training with work as a teaching assistant, providing support to a girl with special educational needs, and later as a taxi driver for her grandparents\u2019 company, driving people to and from Cardiff on Friday and Saturday nights.   Her grandparents, Linda and Derek, brought her up from the age of three days old. They were the ones to first introduce Price to sport, initially as a way to provide an outlet for all her energy as a child, Linda told The National Lottery, which provides funding to British athletes, in 2021. \u201cThey always supported me and told me to believe in my dreams. My nan used to say \u2018reach for the moon, if you fall short you\u2019ll land on the stars,\u2019\u201d Price told Sky Sports. \u201cEven now she got me a good luck card and I\u2019ll read that before fight night, it\u2019s just the little things.\u201d Price\u2019s grandfather, Derek, passed away in November 2020, before he could watch her become an Olympic champion and turn into the new boxing \u201csuperstar,\u201d as Boxxer promoter Ben Shalom said, per the BBC. \u201cI believe that if you work hard enough and you have got dreams, then you can achieve them,\u201d Price told Sky Sports on Saturday before her world title fight. \u201cI was a kid once and I had three things \u2026 I managed to tick all three of them with the love and support of my grandparents.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/sport/lauren-price-world-champion-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Atlanta had a 3% chance at landing the top pick after finishing 10th\u00a0in the Eastern Conference this season with 36-46 record. The team made the play-in tournament but failed to make the postseason. Only four teams have won the lottery with shorter odds than the Hawks, with the Orlando Magic holding the record at 1.52% in 1993.

The Hawks have never had the first pick since the NBA moved to a Draft Lottery in 1985. The Washington Wizards, who were tied with the Detroit Pistons for the highest odds to land the top pick at 14%, will have the second pick. Meanwhile, the Houston Rockets landed the third pick, while the San Antonio Spurs will have the fourth selection. Despite finishing with the worst record in the league, the Pistons will have the fifth selection in the draft.

{"id": "2024_05_13_sport_eton-harrow-lords-cricket-spt-intl", "text": "At Lord\u2019s Cricket Ground in the quiet, well-heeled streets of northwest London, different architectural eras collide together in a mishmash of mismatching styles representing the old and the new. A grand 134-year-old pavilion, its sandy brown stone fa\u00e7ade covered in ornate embellishments, sits at one end, staring at a futuristic glass media center across the pitch which balances on white columns and peers like a giant oblong eye over the ground. And never is that collision between the old and new more evident than when Lord\u2019s, the self-styled \u201chome\u201d of cricket and one of its most prestigious grounds, hosts the annual schoolboys fixture Eton vs. Harrow. The fixture \u2013 in which two of England\u2019s most exclusive and expensive boys\u2019 private schools play one another \u2013 is older than the oldest brick at this ground, first played in 1805 before Lord\u2019s was even at its current location. But it has become increasingly controversial and somewhat emblematic of the attempts of British institutions to reconcile their pasts with the present after it was axed from Lord\u2019s schedule by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which owns the ground, in 2022. That provoked an uproar from its members and the warring factions eventually reached a compromise in which Lord\u2019s would host both the Eton vs. Harrow and Oxford vs.Cambridge fixtures for another five years, as well as the finals of the UK\u2019s school and university cricket competitions, before another consultation with members in 2027. Eton and Harrow both said in separate statements to CNN that it was a \u201chuge privilege\u201d to play at Lord\u2019s again this year and thanked the MCC. For those criticizing the fixture, it is steeped in elitism and serves only to perpetuate stereotypes that cricket is an upper-class sport, one in which public schoolboys play annually on its most hallowed ground where the England Women have never played a Test. \u201cGuaranteeing a tiny number of schoolboys the right to play at Lord\u2019s every year when millions of children are denied that right is completely unacceptable,\u201d said the Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket in its 2023 report, which examined inequalities and discrimination within the English game. However, for those attending Friday\u2019s match \u2013 mostly relatives of the schoolboys on the pitch or alumni who have attended this fixture for decades \u2013 it is an important piece of history to preserve, a cherished tradition and another victim of \u201ccancel culture.\u201d \u2018Part of the season\u2019 The Romantic poet Lord Byron played in the inaugural Eton vs. Harrow match more than two centuries ago. Afterwards, he wrote, \u201cWe were most of us very drunk and we went together to the Haymarket Theatre where we kicked up a row, as you may suppose when so many Harrovians and Etonians meet in one place.\u201d On Friday, cheers and chants began from the moment the two teams walked out onto the sun-drenched pitch. \u201cLet\u2019s go, oi, oi, oi!\u201d shouted the Etonians as they rose to their feet from the first ball, shouting, clapping, and even waving their shoes in their air, as is tradition. In another section of the stands, the Harrovians reciprocated with a standing ovation at the first boundary, before the Etonians launched into a rendition of the \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d theme song when a player called Jack Sparrow bowled his first over. \u201cThe atmosphere today has been incredible; everyone has been really friendly. I\u2019ve never known such a convivial atmosphere before,\u201d Mark McCullen, who attended Eton and whose son is now at the school, told CNN Sport. There is no qualification procedure for the fixture. Eton and Harrow play at Lord\u2019s because they have played here for 219 years, because they are schools that are held aloft on their centuries-old history and which still churn out a disproportionate number of the British establishment. Twenty of the country\u2019s 45 Prime Ministers, including two of its last five, went to Eton; another seven Prime Ministers went to Harrow. It costs \u00a349,998 ($62,620) per year to attend Eton, and \u00a350,550 ($63,310) to attend Harrow, though both offer bursaries and scholarships for a small number of students. For many spectators, this fixture is an intrinsic part of the schools\u2019 respective histories, a tradition that remains from a time when debutantes making their entrance into upper-class society had to attend it, along with Wimbledon and the Ascot Races. Times may have changed but the tradition remains, making it almost sacrosanct for those who observe it and out-of-touch for those who don\u2019t. \u201cI think it\u2019s rather disappointing that there are a lot of people at the MCC whothink this fixture should be abolished because it\u2019s elitist,\u201d Harry Wells, an OldEtonian who first came to this fixture 57 years ago and is this year supporting hisfriend\u2019s son in the Harrow squad, told CNN. \u201cI think our country is going to sell itself down the river if it abolishes everything we\u2019ve held dear over the millennia.\u201d As late as the 1960s, carriages would pull up outside the ground, depositing families there for one of the biggest events of the \u201cseason,\u201d spectators who had watched those matches recalled. The crowds are smaller now, drawing in less money for the MCC, and around 2,000 to 3,000 people were expected to attend this year. \u201cIt used to be a big social event \u2026 people in top hat and tails. It was quite part of the season as they used to say in those days,\u201d Wells added. \u201cEveryone dresses down now, we\u2019re not so formal in any form of society, though looking here, there are lots of people in jackets and ties.\u201d Despite the May sunshine, almost every man wandered around in their suits, the Eton boys wore their red striped blazers and matching hats, the Harrow boys their navy-blue blazers while women wore flowing dresses or blouses and many carried designer handbags. \u201cI don\u2019t feel a sense of exclusivity at all,\u201d one spectator told CNN, pointing to the \u00a320 ($25) ticket available for people to come and watch. \u201cThe boys work really hard to get here \u2026 You may as well get rid of history because it\u2019s traditional and backward and imperialistic and whatever,\u201d she added. \u201cWe have to learn from the past, and the successes of the past too.\u201d \u2018A turgid image of snobbery\u2019 The question of the Eton vs. Harrow match has become entangled in the wider conversations around cricket presently. The sport \u2013 long associated with the English upper classes \u2013 has been buffeted by accusations of racism, sexism and elitism in the country where it originated while it has millions of fans around the world, considered more popular than any other global sport except soccer. For actor, writer and comedian Stephen Fry, the Eton vs. Harrow match is indicative of an image that English cricket can\u2019t quite shake off, what he described as \u201ca turgid image of snobbery and elitism.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not what cricket is about,\u201d Fry, a former MCC president and longtime cricket fan, told the Times in October 2022. \u201cIt\u2019s the second most popular sport in the world and it needs people to understand what a wonderful game it is, and how it\u2019s available for everybody.\u201d In the end on Friday, Harrow coasted to victory by 91 runs, posting 321-5 before Eton could only respond with 230 all out. And there may not be too many more opportunities for Eton to retaliate. \u201cTimes change. And the world is so far removed from that world now,\u201d Mark Nicholas, the current MCC president, told the Telegraph in October. \u201cCommon sense will prevail over the next four years within this compromise\u2026 I can see it moving on from here now very naturally.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/sport/eton-harrow-lords-cricket-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_sport_bayer-leverkusen-unbeaten-record-europa-league-spt-intl", "text": "Bayer Leverkusen\u2019s remarkable season took another extraordinary turn on Thursday as a late 2-2 draw against AS Roma stretched the club\u2019s unbeaten run to 49 games. The 4-2 aggregate victory saw Leverkusen reach a first European final in 22 years, while Josip\u00a0Stani\u0161i\u0107\u2019s 97th-minute strike ensured that the recently-crowned German champion remains undefeated this season. It means that Leverkusen has now surpassed Portuguese team Benfica\u2019s record from 1963-65 for the longest unbeaten run across all top-level matches since the introduction of European competitions,\u00a0according to UEFA. Leverkusen had come into the second-leg match at the BayArena with a two-goal lead, though that advantage was cancelled out when Leandro Paredes converted two penalties for Roma either side of halftime. The home side dominated possession throughout but struggled to capitalize on several good chances, and it wasn\u2019t until the 82nd minute that Gianluca Mancini\u2019s unfortunate own goal offered hope of a comeback. Then in the dying moments, with the likelihood of a draw quickly fading, Stani\u0161i\u0107\u00a0made a brilliant run into the box and slotted the ball into the net with the final act of the game, sparking bedlam inside the sellout stadium. Late goals have become something of a habit for Leverkusen, and this was the 17th time this season that the Bundesliga team has scored in the 90th minute or later. \u201cTo show that personality, that reaction after the second goal, to keep going and after to come back \u2013 it means a lot for us,\u201d manager Xabi Alonso said after the game. \u201cIt says a lot about the team, the conviction that\u00a0we have and it\u2019s great to finally reach the final. Last year we were really close but this year we\u2019re happy (to be) in the final and now against another Italian team.\u201d Leverkusen will face Atalanta in the Europa League final on May 22 in Dublin, Ireland, and has four games remaining to complete the season without defeat. Having already ended a 31-year trophy drought by winning a first German league title, Leverkusen can still win two more pieces of silverware this season \u2013 the Europa League and the German Cup \u2013 against Atlanta and second-tier side FC Kaiserslautern. Completing an invincible treble while remaining undefeated would certainly go down as one of greatest achievements by a European soccer club, and Leverkusen could become the first team in Bundesliga history to go a whole season without a loss if it wins its final two league matches against VfL Bochum and Augsburg. According to UEFA, Scottish side Celtic\u2019s unbeaten run of 62 games between 1915 and 1917 is the outright record for a European club, although that only included domestic league matches. \u201cIt\u2019s pure goosebumps,\u201d said Leverkusen midfielder Granit Xhaka after Thursday\u2019s game. \u201cYou dream of an atmosphere like this. You dream of games like this. As a kid, you want to be in these games and then when you equalize just before the end and get to the final, it\u2019s incredible. We will definitely enjoy this night now.\u201d Leverkusen, which has won 40 games and drawn nine this season, resumes its incredible campaign away against Bochum on Sunday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/sport/bayer-leverkusen-unbeaten-record-europa-league-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Beverley called his actions \u201cinexcusable\u201d after an incident in the final minutes of a playoff game last week. He was seen on video\u00a0throwing a ball into the stands, appearing to hit a fan in the head after the first throw.

When a different reporter proceeded to ask Beverley a question, he asked the producer to move the microphone out of his face before asking her to leave his circle. CNN has reached out to the NBA and Bucks for comment but did not immediately hear back. It appears the suspension will take place at the beginning of next season. Beverley spoke about the incident on Wednesday on his podcast, \u201cThe Pat Bev Podcast.\u201d He said he was called a word he hasn\u2019t \u201cbeen before\u201d but added it was an \u201cunfortunate situation that never should have happened.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been called a lot of stuff in this league,\u201d Beverley added. \u201cI haven\u2019t been called that one \u2026 Still inexcusable. It doesn\u2019t matter what was said. I have to be better and I will be better.\u201d It is unclear what the spectator allegedly said to Beverley. Beverley added that he did not want to take away from the Indiana fans, who he said were \u201cgreat\u201d but that some took it \u201ca little bit too far.\u201d One day after the loss, Bucks head coach Doc Rivers called Beverley\u2019s actions \u201cnot the Milwaukee way or the Bucks way.\u201d Rivers added: \u201cWe\u2019re better than that. Pat (Beverley) feels awful about that. He also understands emotionally \u2013 this is an emotional game and things happen \u2013 unfortunately, you\u2019re judged immediately and he let the emotions get the better of him.\u201d The Bucks went on to lose 120-98, eliminating them from the NBA Playoffs. Beverley, who just finished his 12th year in the league, was traded to the Bucks from the Philadelphia 76ers in February, and averaged 6.2 points, 3.3 rebounds and 2.9 assists this season. He is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent this offseason.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/sport/patrick-beverley-milwaukee-bucks-nba-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "sports"}}

The 29-year-old Serbian averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9.0 assists per game this season \u2013 all in the top 10 across the league \u2013 while helping lead the defending champion Nuggets to a 57-25 record and the second seed in the Western Conference. Joki\u0107 becomes the ninth player in NBA history to win the award at least three times. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar holds the record with six MVP titles, Michael Jordan and Bill Russell have won it five times, and Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James four times. Larry Bird, Magic Johnson and Moses Malone have also won it on three occasions. Oklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander came second in the voting and Dallas Mavericks guard Luka Don\u010di\u0107 finished third. Joki\u0107 thanked his teammates and coaches when asked about his thoughts on his string of MVP awards. \u201cWithout them, I am nothing,\u201d Joki\u0107 told NBA on TNT. \u201cCoaches, players, organization, medical staff \u2026 It\u2019s all one big circle. I cannot be what I am without them. \u201cThere are a lot of players that deserve it, it\u2019s probably details and small things [that decide the result].\u201d This is the sixth consecutive year an international player has won the award. The last American player to win the honor was James Harden in the 2017-18 season. In the 2023-24 season, Joki\u0107 became only the second person in NBA history \u2013 after Oscar Robertson in 1961-62 \u2013 to register 2,000 points, 900 rebounds and 700 assists in a season. Joki\u0107 ranked 10th in points per game, fourth in rebounds per game and third in assists per game and second for double-doubles (68) and triple-doubles (25). Nuggets head coach Michael Malone lauded Joki\u0107 in February after the player racked up a then league-leading 15th triple-double of the season. \u201cHe\u2019s a world champion and he\u2019s a Finals MVP because, every night, just his ability to be great for himself, but more importantly, his ability to make everyone around him better \u2013 and that truly is the definition of greatness,\u201d Malone told reporters. \u201cAnd we have been spoiled. I\u2019m sure some of us do find ourselves maybe taking it for granted, but just remind yourself that there\u2019s not many guys like Nikola Joki\u0107 that walk through those doors and appreciate every opportunity that you have to watch him play.\u201d The Nuggets will need every ounce of Joki\u0107\u2019s three-time MVP talent when they face the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday. The defending champions are 2-0 down after losing two straight at home to begin the Western Conference semifinals, with Minnesota\u2019s league-best defense so far effectively stifling Joki\u0107 and his teammates.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/sport/nikola-jokic-denver-nuggets-nba-mvp/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2023_02_05_sport_head-injury-suicide-female-athletes-intl-spt-cmd", "text": "Kelly Catlin and Ellie Soutter never met, but they had a lot in common.  Both were commanding athletes: Catlin, a US track cyclist, was a three-times world champion and Olympic silver medalist, and Soutter, a snowboarder, was tipped to be one of Team Great Britain\u2019s strongest contenders for the 2022 Winter Olympics, having already won a bronze medal at the 2017 European Youth Olympic Festival.  Both were incredibly smart \u2013 Catlin was studying for a master\u2019s degree in computational and mathematical engineering at Stanford University, while Soutter learned to speak French in about six months, according to her father.   At times they almost seemed superhuman. In 2013, after only three weeks of formal training and having broken her wrist, Soutter became British Champion with her arm in a cast. Meanwhile, Catlin, who had a tenderness for children, once rode 80 miles through sleet and snow to speak to a grade school about her Olympic experience.    Yet these two women\u2019s lives were tragically cut short after they sustained serious head injuries in their pursuit of sporting greatness and then took their own lives. Catlin was 23, while Soutter died by suicide on her 18th birthday.  Females may be more susceptible to concussion, and they also have worse and prolonged symptoms after their injury than men, according to a review of 25 studies of sport-related concussion published in the Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine.  However, women remain significantly underrepresented within sport and exercise science research. This, leading experts warn, means they often do not get the treatment or aftercare they need following a head injury.  Women\u2019s sports have historically not received the same attention or funding as men\u2019s sports, Dr. Ann McKee, Director of the Boston University Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s been shown that women athletes are more likely to get a concussion, they tend to have longer recovery periods,\u201d McKee added. \u201cWe do not have enough information about what happens in the female brain. We don\u2019t know if women are biologically more susceptible to these injuries,\u201d she said, adding that some research suggests the size and musculature of women\u2019s necks could play a part. Kelly  Before becoming a track cyclist, Catlin, a triplet, was a national champion road cyclist and time trial national champion, her father Mark, told CNN. After winning a Canadian international race at 17 she was invited to an Olympic training camp for a try out, where, impressed by her performance numbers, coaches immediately offered her a position on the track pursuit team.  Catlin\u2019s father, Mark, told CNN, that his daughter was \u201cintense\u201d and \u201cambitious,\u201d attributes she channeled into her sporting life. Her life changed irrevocably in January 2019. Practicing fast downhill descents in the hills near Los Angeles, she crashed and went skidding down the road.  Despite suffering road rash, Catlin got back on her bike, and finished the ride. It wasn\u2019t her first crash \u2013 she had experienced 4 or 5 hard crashes before this, her father said, and after the latest, she didn\u2019t have any symptoms at the time.  But soon after, at a World Cup track event in Berlin, Catlin was gripped by a sudden and severe headache.   \u201cShe couldn\u2019t compete,\u201d her father said. \u201cKelly is kind of this stoical individual. And if she\u2019s rolling around on the ground, clutching her head, it has to be a severe thing.\u201d On closer inspection, Catlin\u2019s helmet from LA had dents in it. Her father told CNN that this, coupled with her symptoms, caused her family to become aware she had suffered a concussion, which was later confirmed with a diagnosis from Stanford\u2019s Health Centre.  A concussion is a brain injury which happens after a hit to the head or body causes the brain to move back and forth inside the skull, according to the CDC. When Catlin returned to the US, her father says she was examined by the track training center in Colorado. It was confirmed she suffered a concussion, and a return to training protocol was advised, but not implemented or communicated to her coach, he said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any follow-up from Colorado after this. I believe they assumed she would seek care at Stanford,\u201d he told CNN.  CNN has reached out to Stanford and USA Cycling for comment.  Catlin\u2019s symptoms didn\u2019t improve, and in weekly phone calls with her parents, she admitted she was struggling with schoolwork and was unable to concentrate. Stanford Health Center, having diagnosed Catlin with concussion with ongoing symptoms, recommended that she decrease her training for 2 weeks and then gradually build back up and start sessions with an athletic trainer, medical documents sent to CNN by her father show. She was referred to a concussion specialist, the document adds. She tried to train, but \u201cshe would have to stop because she got a severe headache just from walking,\u201d according to her father. Her heart rate would also accelerate rapidly from even the smallest exertion, leaving her with \u201cno exercise tolerance whatsoever,\u201d he added.  Her injury had other consequences. \u201cAs far as we knew she was never a person that suffered from depression. She had an interesting sense of humor.  She was always upbeat and bubbly about things,\u201d her father told CNN.  \u201cShe basically thought her life was over. She was no longer able to be the athlete that she was, she was failing her teammates. And she wasn\u2019t able to succeed in school now. And I think ultimately, that\u2019s why she took her life, because she thought her life was over,\u201d he added.  At the end of January, Catlin made a serious but non-fatal suicide attempt, and was involuntarily admitted to the locked psychiatric ward at Stanford, her father told CNN. A month after that attempt, she took her own life.     Ellie   Soutter\u2019s father Tony said there were many dimensions to his young daughter \u2013 not only was she an \u201cadrenaline junkie,\u201d but she was \u201cvery conscientious\u201d and excelled in school, even after moving from England to France.   Aged 12, Soutter took up snowboarding at school \u2013 and just months later, she was spotted in her hometown resort of Les Gets and trialed by Team Great Britain in February 2013.  \u201cIt was quite obvious why she kept winning competitions because she just made it easy,\u201d her father said. \u201cShe just made it look graceful and beautiful.\u201d But training took its toll \u2013 Soutter told CNN that his daughter suffered seven major concussions in five years, between 2013 and 2018.  \u201cI was being advised by doctors \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, she\u2019s young enough she\u2019ll bounce back. As she progressed, becoming an elite athlete starting on the World Cup circuit, every time she had another concussion, they got worse, and they took longer to recover from,\u201d he told CNN.     \u201cWith every concussion, with the exception of a few minor knocks, Ellie saw a doctor in person,\u201d he added. \u201cI was always told that she was young enough to bounce back to full health after each case and therefore never consulted with the doctors that I met, about any previous concussions.\u201d But Soutter\u2019s final concussion was so \u201chuge\u201d that she spent two nights in the hospital. \u201cWhen I got there, she didn\u2019t even know who I was or where she was,\u201d her father said. Soutter was then selected for the Junior Snowboard World Championships in New Zealand August 2018.  But a month before the competition, she died by suicide.  Her father said a neurologist conducted a CT scan of her brain and reaction tests three months after her final concussion, but said she was \u201cabsolutely fine\u201d and could continue competing.                                                                                                                                 Like Catlin, Soutter had issues with studying and concentrating, becoming more insular as she suffered from crippling headaches. She also started suffering from insomnia.  \u201cShe would literally sit with the tutor a good month after a concussion, and suddenly, she\u2019d go blind. She\u2019d not be able to see \u2013 everything would go black and dark,\u201d her father said. After missing a flight to snowboard training, Soutter died by suicide on her 18th birthday. Team GB referred CNN to GB Snowsport when approached for comment, adding that Ellie only competed for Team GB at one event.  In order to represent Britain in international competitions, GB Snowsport says athletes or their coaches are required to demonstrate that the athlete has reached established performance criteria, is of the relevant technical ability to compete, and has appropriate medical clearance to compete. A large number of athletes can represent Britain at different levels of international competition but are not part of a programme delivered and overseen by GB Snowsport.  \u201cAs Ellie was not part of the GB Snowsport programme, we were unable to implement a personalised recovery and management programme for Ellie,\u201d a spokesperson for GB Snowsport told CNN in an email. \u201cShe was, however, covered by national policies and protocols around fitness to compete, and would not have been cleared for any activity \u2013 training or competition \u2013 overseen by GB Snowsport without being able to demonstrate appropriate medical sign-off,\u201d they added. The spokesperson for GB Snowsport told CNN: \u201cWe take concussions and head injuries incredibly seriously, and in reviewing contemporaneous records from the time that Ellie was involved in snowsport we are confident that GB Snowsport staff applied and followed every appropriate process.\u201d Catlin and Soutter aren\u2019t the only young sporting women whose lives have been cut short in this way. After 29-year-old Australian rules football player Jacinda Barclay took her life in 2020, post-mortem research by scientists found that she had degradation to her cerebral white matter unusual for someone her age.  \u201cFor someone her age, you would expect to see lovely pristine white matter, and hers looked like she was an old woman in that it was basically degraded,\u201d Michael Buckland, founder and Executive Director of the Australian Sports Brain Bank, who studied Barclay\u2019s brain, told CNN.  \u201cWe haven\u2019t gone back and done specific white matter studies on our donors,\u201d he told CNN, adding that the bank hasn\u2019t done peer reviewed research on this.  \u201cBut what struck me, just as someone that sees a lot of brains \u2013 this is not normal for someone of that age.\u201d  Damage to white matter has been associated with dementia, according to research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.   Opportunities missed Suicide after concussion is rare. However patients diagnosed with concussion or mild traumatic brain injury had double the risk of suicide and a higher risk of suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts than people without brain injuries, a 2018 study from researchers at the University of Harvard published in JAMA Neurology found. Dr. Robert Cantu, clinical professor of neurology at the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at Boston University School of Medicine told CNN that there are several theories as to why incidence of suicide is higher in people who have suffered concussion. One theory, he explained, is that those suffering from persistent post-concussion symptoms may have structural or functional brain damage and could be experiencing \u201cbehavioral dysregulation: short fuse, irritability, [and] can\u2019t suppress impulses the way you normally could.\u201d   With these emotional problems, \u201cthey would be more prone to perhaps do something impulsive, like commit suicide,\u201d Cantu, medical director of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, told CNN. A second theory, Cantu noted, is that post-concussive symptoms prevent people from getting back into their sport and stop them \u201cfrom being the person that they were before their injury.\u201d Neither theory is proven to the exclusion of the other, Cantu said, adding he thinks increased suicidality was \u201ca combined factor involving both in many, if not most cases.\u201d There are also differences in the way brain injuries affect women.  A study of female soccer players across US high schools found they are nearly twice as likely to suffer concussion as their male counterparts, according to research that looked at over 80,000 adolescent athletes, published in the journal JAMA Network Open.  Women remain significantly underrepresented within sport and exercise science research: a 2021 study examining papers from some of the most influential sports medical journals found that only 6% of the studies were solely focused on women, compared with 31% of studies that included just men. Other researchers have pointed to female sex hormones, with risk of concussion changing with hormone levels during a menstrual cycle.  McKee said all athletes can also experience \u201cnon-concussive\u201d injuries: \u201chits to the head that can be of the same magnitude as concussion, but they don\u2019t rise to the level of symptoms for whatever reason, so a player tends to play right through it.\u201d Cumulative exposure to repetitive head impacts \u2013 including concussion and non- concussive injuries \u2013 increases the risk for the neurodegenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known as CTE, McKee said.  The disease, which can only be formally diagnosed with an autopsy, has mostly been seen in either veterans or people who played contact sports, particularly American football, say researchers. The disease occurs when the brain starts to degenerate likely due to repeated head traumas, according to the Mayo Clinic, which notes CTE is \u201cassociated with recurrent concussions.\u201d But scientists aren\u2019t only concerned about concussions.  Previous studies have shown subconcussive head impacts \u2013 repetitive hits to the head and body that do not cause symptoms \u2013 can still result in long-term neurological disease.   According to The Concussion Legacy Foundation, \u201cthe best available evidence suggests that subconcussive impacts, not concussions, are the driving force behind CTE.\u201d There have been cases of CTE discovered in athletes who have never been diagnosed with a concussion, according to the Concussion Legacy Foundation. And other changes in the brain after repetitive head impacts aside from CTE are likely \u201cequally important,\u201d McKee said. \u201cWe also see damage to the white matter. And that appears to be mostly in the frontal lobe, but also in the temporal lobes,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to understand the relationship of those white matter changes to behavioral and mood symptoms, perhaps even suicidality,\u201d she said.  McKee stressed that concussion management is important, but physicians and athletes should also be aware of other injuries. \u201cThe problem is the subclinical hits \u2013 the non-concussive injuries that aren\u2019t detected, you don\u2019t pull the player off the field \u2013 and they can be in the hundreds or even the 1000s in a single season,\u201d she explained. Lack of research  Though a growing body of data suggests women in sport are more likely to sustain a concussion, have more severe symptoms, and to take longer to recover, most sports-related concussions protocols are based on data from men.  In a review in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers looked at 171 concussion studies written since 1967 which are used to inform the most influential consensus and position statements in treating sports-related concussions. Clinicians rely on these documents to guide their medical practice when treating athletes \u2013 but most of the studies are focused on men. Only 1% of them was looking exclusively at concussions in women and 40% of them didn\u2019t have any women in a sample of participants at all.   There is another risk factor for women in sport when they sustain head injuries, Katherine Snedaker, founder and executive director of PINK Concussions, a non-profit dedicated to women\u2019s health and brain injury, told CNN.  There is a gulf of millions of dollars separating women and men when it comes to average annual salaries in most professional sports. Outside of elite sport, Snedaker says, female athletes often don\u2019t have access to the same medical care as men, meaning head injuries aren\u2019t spotted as routinely.   \u201cThey tend to push really hard through the injury,\u201d she said. And many women can\u2019t afford to take time out to recover: even professional athletes will supplement their sports income with other jobs, she added, and many are caregivers. \u201cWhen they really crater, it\u2019s a couple of days or weeks later.\u201d  Snedaker said female athletes often weren\u2019t aware they had suffered a head injury. If they were, she said, there were no appropriate medical or sporting staff to inform. Not enough support The families of Catlin and Soutter feel the young women didn\u2019t get enough support after their injuries. After Catlin\u2019s first suicide attempt, she was released from an involuntary admission to the psychiatric ward after threatening legal action, and a conference between psychiatrists, her coach and her parents.  She attended therapy sessions, which she agreed to attend during the conference, but found \u201cthey were geared toward suicidal freshman with a whole set of different issues than an elite Olympic athlete,\u201d her father told CNN. She got a referral to a sports psychologist that worked with the Stanford athletic department, but the department forbade the psychologist from seeing Catlin because she was not a varsity athlete, her father added.  She contacted the office of a sports psychologist with whom she had developed a rapport while in the hospital \u2013 but, his appointment secretary said he had no openings for six months, her father told CNN.  \u201cWherever she turned she could not find help,\u201d he said, adding that his daughter tried a suicide hotline several times: she was once put on hold and once received no answer. Catlin described his daughter as a \u201cstoic, female warrior type person that isn\u2019t going to admit that she\u2019s struggling.\u201d  \u201cShe needed a sports psychiatrist that really could understand what she was going through and understand the rigors of her life in terms of preparation for competitions and the athletic side of it and what it could potentially do to you.\u201d Her father said a major factor in his daughter\u2019s death was \u201ca lack of communication between the facilities that were involved in Kelly\u2019s care. No one was in charge and they assumed the other institutions were following up when they weren\u2019t,\u201d he added. In a statement sent to CNN, Luisa Rapport, director of emergency communications and media relations at Stanford University did not address any of the specific allegations made by Catlin\u2019s family.  She said while the university does not discuss in the media the details of individual students\u2019 experiences, \u201csupporting the mental and emotional health of students is a critical priority for Stanford.\u201d  \u201cStudents in need of mental health crisis assistance \u2013 including students having suicidal thoughts \u2013 and those who are concerned about students in need of assistance, can contact the University\u2019s Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) 24 hours-a-day, seven days-a-week,\u201d she added. Rapport said that in addition to this, \u201cthere are multiple places where psychological services may be provided for students depending on individualized need and treatment recommendations, including, for example, affiliated hospital services and clinics through Stanford\u2019s Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, and mental health programs and clinicians in the community.\u201d In a statement sent to CNN, USA Cycling said it was \u201cdevastated\u201d by Catlin\u2019s death, adding: \u201cShe brought focus and determination to everything she did, and served as an inspiration to everyone who knew her.  \u201cAs the National Governing Body for the sport of cycling, USA Cycling prioritizes the holistic wellbeing of the riders on the U.S. National Team and has a longstanding commitment to providing both physical and mental health resources to members of the team,\u201d a representative for USA Cycling added.   After his daughter Ellie\u2019s death, Soutter was contacted by the UNITE Brain Bank, who wanted to study her brain as part of their research into CTE. But even in that facility \u2013 the biggest of its kind in the world \u2013 of some 1,300 brains, only 3% belonged to women, Ann McKee, Director of the Boston University Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center told CNN. \u201cWhen I actually started looking into CTE \u2013 all of the work that they\u2019ve done with the footballers in America, she had every single symptom and more,\u201d Soutter told CNN. \u201cIt was quite obvious to me that there was a definite link in her starting to get into dark places and feeling bad and anxious and not sleeping properly. All of those symptoms \u2026 Every one that\u2019s involved in CTE was part of Ellie\u2019s life,\u201d he added. \u201cI truly believe today that my daughter would be alive had I had any inkling, you know, even the smallest bit of information.\u201d Editor\u2019s Note: If you are in the US and you or a loved one have contemplated suicide, call The National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255) to connect with a trained counselor.

{"id": "2024_04_22_sport_nelly-korda-chevron-championship-lpga-record-spt-intl", "text": "American golfer Nelly Korda clinched a remarkable fifth victory in a row on Sunday, sealing her second major title with a win at the Chevron Championship and in the process levelling the LPGA Tour record for consecutive wins. The world No.1 finished two shots clear of Sweden\u2019s Maja Stark at Carlton Woods in Texas, a final round three-under 69 enough to top the leaderboard at 13-under overall. Having begun the year on eight LPGA Tour wins, Korda has surged to 13 in a matter of months. The 25-year-old Floridian\u2019s fifth successive triumph sees her join compatriot Nancy Lopez (1978) and Sweden\u2019s Annika S\u00f6renstam (2005) as the only LPGA players to build such a streak. Set to tee up at the JM Eagle LA Championship in Los Angeles this week, she could stand alone with six in a row by Sunday. For the moment though, its time to celebrate \u2013 and breathe. \u201cIt\u2019s just been a crazy, crazy, crazy couple of weeks, with some really solid golf,\u201d Korda, still damp from her leap into the lake beside the 18th hole, told reporters. \u201cI was definitely starting to feel it on the back nine, just the nerves setting in,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s everything that I\u2019ve always wanted as a little girl, to lift that major trophy. \u201cI can finally breathe now and just enjoy the moment because I was definitely really nervous. I feel sick to my stomach.\u201d It was a hard-earned second major crown for Korda, who claimed her first at the Women\u2019s PGA Championship in 2021. Saturday\u2019s play had concluded early after storm delays, leaving the American to finish the last seven holes of her third round on Sunday. Seven straight pars saw her begin the final round one shot behind South Korean leader Ryu Hae-ran, but Korda wasted little time making her move, birdieing four times through the first 10 holes to race ahead. A bogey at the following hole marked her first since the 7th of Friday\u2019s second round, an unblemished 39-hole run. Yet 24-year-old Stark was putting together a run of her own to apply pressure, never carding less than par across the last 26 holes and closing with back-to-back birdies to send Korda to the final tee with a slender one-shot cushion. Any self-confessed nerves were hard to spot though, as Korda came close to converting for eagle from inside 30 feet before stroking home for birdie and $1.2 million in prize money. Korda has already topped her most prolific season, a dominant 2021 that saw her tally four LPGA Tour wins. Yet the following year saw her playing appearances hampered, as surgery on a blood clot on her arm saw Korda \u2013 \u201cscared for her health\u201d \u2013 take a prolonged break from competitive action. \u201cI was not thinking about competing at all,\u201d she admitted Sunday. \u201cBut I think all of the sad times and the health scares that I have gone through have made me who I am today. I think it has matured me a lot, and I would say it\u2019s shaped me into the person I am today, and I\u2019m very grateful for the ups and downs.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/22/sport/nelly-korda-chevron-championship-lpga-record-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_sport_gareth-southgate-england-euro-2024-spt-intl", "text": "Gareth Southgate knows what it\u2019s like to feel pressure. He\u2019s felt the weight and expectation of a nation on his shoulders as both a player and a manager, so too the kaleidoscopic, bittersweet emotions and fine margins that are all entangled in the game of football. And, as he prepares for his fourth and potentially final major tournament as England manager at this summer\u2019s Euro 2024 in Germany, he also knows that history is ultimately written by the victors. \u201cThe tournaments are what you\u2019re in the role for. It\u2019s ultimately where you\u2019re judged and these are the opportunities to make history,\u201d Southgate told CNN Sport\u2019s Amanda Davies. \u201cUltimately, we\u2019ll be judged on whether we win this.\u201d So near, yet so far Twice Southgate and his England team have been one page, one blot of ink away from writing their own names into the history books. At first it was an unfancied, courageous march to the semifinals of the World Cup in 2018 only to be undone by the mastery of Luka Modri\u0107 and Croatia. That run, though, won over the hearts and minds of a disillusioned footballing public at home and gave birth to an iconic waistcoat. And then one heart-breaking step closer \u2013 a penalty shootout loss to Italy in the final of Euro 2020. That defeat was met with sobering numbness on the one hand, plaudits for unwavering solidarity in the wake of online racist abuse towards some of England\u2019s penalty takers on the other. Ultimately, however, it was another case of what could have been. The wait for a major trophy for the men\u2019s team goes on, 58 years of hurt since World Cup triumph in 1966. \u2018Final step\u2019 \u201cUp to this point, I wouldn\u2019t have said in Russia that was a realistic target given where the team had been,\u201d said Southgate \u201cOf course, we got so close in the last Euros [\u2026.] We were one penalty away, one goal not conceded away from being European champions anyway. So, the players know how close we are. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve been that close [\u2026] in the end, you need to take that final step.\u201d Germany in 2024 may well present the best chance to take that elusive final step. Certainly, that is, if the bookmakers are to be believed. England and 2018 world champion France currently lead the way with the host lingering in the background. When asked whether it was indeed the best chance, Southgate replied: \u201cIt\u2019s the next chance, so we\u2019ll only know afterwards whether it was the best chance. Last chance saloon sounds desperado! \u201cThis is a chance to come back, having made history or not. Simple as that. \u201cWe know that we are one of the teams that can win the tournament, and we know it\u2019s knockout football and anything can happen [\u2026] It\u2019s about delivering in the key moments that matter. \u201cWe\u2019re comfortable with the expectation, particularly in England. \u201cUltimately, people will judge it in a very binary way, but there\u2019s a lot more wrapped up in that in terms of performance.\u201d Blessing or curse? Despite his recent unparalleled success at major tournaments, Southgate has drawn criticism from some pundits and fans alike over his tactical approach. Conversative, regressive, boring \u2013 those are just some of the tropes bandied about during his eight-year tenure in charge of the senior team. All this is set against arguably the greatest abundance of raw talent and player depth the nation has ever had \u2013 from the craft of Trent Alexander-Arnold, the authority of Jude Bellingham and the wizardry of Phil Foden to the skilfulness of Bukayo Saka and the sharpshooting of Harry Kane. So, are such riches at his disposal a blessing or a curse? \u201cOh blessing,\u201d insisted Southgate. \u201cYou\u2019d rather have good players than not, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d He then proceeded to lay out his case for the defence against the naysayers. \u201cHave we had some consistency in selection? I think we have. Have we given young players opportunities? I would say we have,\u201d said the 53-year-old. \u201cWe\u2019ve relied on some regulars. That\u2019s normally been in areas of the pitch where we don\u2019t have the same competition for places [\u2026] and in a lot of those positions, they\u2019re still the best players in those individual positions on the pitch that we have available. \u201cI have faith in what we\u2019re doing. We know our players better than anybody else does [\u2026] And frankly, everybody else gets the same scrutiny anyway. So, it\u2019s part and parcel of being a manager.\u201d Indeed, Southgate is no stranger at having to navigate the hostile dynamic that has often existed between the England team and the British media. He was a saint in England\u2019s march towards what many fans hoped would be European glory on home soil in 1996, then with the snap of a finger, immediately a sinner for missing a decisive penalty against Germany in the semifinals. What followed was years of ridicule. Strong leadership on and off the field built on the pillars of compassion, humility and sincerity has, though, gone a long way to shaking off that association and rebuilding the former defender\u2019s image. Surely, then, victory in Germany this summer would put a perfect bowtie on one of football\u2019s great redemption stories? \u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe in fairy tales\u201d said the self-effacing Southgate. \u201cThere are lots of examples where those things have been teed up and people have fallen just short. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, to beat Germany in the last Euros was an important moment for us. We hadn\u2019t beaten Germany in a knockout game since 1966. \u201cWhen you\u2019re the coach or the manager, it\u2019s about your team and your plan is not about you.\u201d \u2018The decision will be mine\u2019 And yet much of the speculation in the buildup to this summer\u2019s tournament is around Southgate\u2019s own future. Although his existing contract expires in December 2024, England\u2019s Football Association is reportedly keen to extend his tenure with The Three Lions through to the 2026 World Cup. But the temptation of a return to club management may yet prove to be too strong with Manchester United rumored to be interested in acquiring his services. The Englishman, though, is adamant that he and he alone will have the final say on where the next chapter in his career lies. \u201cIt (the decision) will be mine,\u201d he smiled. \u201cSitting here now I\u2019m just completely focused on \u2018How do we win this tournament?\u2019 \u201cIt would be wrong to be thinking beyond that because, ultimately, I know what is needed to be achieved. \u201cWhen you\u2019re on the cusp on a tournament like this then every hour you\u2019re thinking about the team, nothing else. \u201cThere are times where you sit there thinking, \u2018I bet nobody else in the world is thinking about England at the moment\u2019 but, of course, when the tournament comes, then everybody\u2019s thinking about it.\u201d Despite being engulfed in the all-consuming world of overseeing the national team, Southgate remains conscious of his relative inexperience in management. Prior to moving into the national set-up, he had only managed English club Middlesbrough for three years. Following his sacking in October 2009 he spent four years in the wilderness before taking charge of the England Under-21 team in 2013. He eventually made the step up to the senior team on a permanent basis in November 2016 having served as interim manager in the wake of Sam Allardyce\u2019s resignation. The possibilities that lie ahead of him are many and varied. \u201cIt\u2019s (club management) probably not something to consider at this time,\u201d said Southgate. \u201cI\u2019ve got a big challenge ahead. (I\u2019ve got) enough to think about over the next couple of months. \u201cThe outcome of the tournament will determine everything. In terms of managerial experience, I\u2019m still only 250 games because my journey has been different to a lot of other people. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of life to live ahead of me and there are lots of experiences that I want to have in life generally. There\u2019s also, I hope, plenty of time to do that.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/sport/gareth-southgate-england-euro-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_04_29_sport_caledonian-braves-american-investors-scotland-spt-intl", "text": "Soccer is becoming firmly entrenched in mainstream pop culture with hit television shows like\u00a0\u201cTed Lasso\u201d and \u201cWelcome to Wrexham,\u201d the documentary series\u00a0detailing Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney\u2019s ownership of the Welsh soccer club, introducing the sport to new audiences in the US and abroad \u2013 as Chris Ewing is quickly discovering. On any given evening, Ewing receives emails informing him that some fan in a far-flung location \u2013 say, Los Angeles \u2013 has just invested in his tiny Scottish soccer club, the Caledonian Braves. \u201cThen 10 minutes later, there would be someone from Australia invest in the club and it\u2019s just like, \u2018Wow, I can\u2019t believe it,\u2019\u201d Ewing, the club\u2019s founder, tells CNN Sport. Nestled in the leafy outskirts of Motherwell, a town about 20 kilometers southeast of Glasgow, the Caledonian Braves play in the Scottish fifth division with a team of mostly amateur players at a ground with capacity for just 500 fans. But, despite its small home, Ewing\u2019s vision of creating a fan-owned club, steeped in values of diversity and community with ambitions of reaching the Scottish Premier League, has attracted more than $300,000 in investment from more than 1,000 owners around the world, far outstripping the annual running costs of about $58,000, he says. Among those owners include an NBA player, an NBA coach and a\u00a0players\u2019 union executive\u00a0as well as soccer players in the US\u2019 National Women Super League (NWSL). Investors in 49 US states have bought in \u2013 Wyoming is the only state pending on the list, he says. \u201cA community club, most people would think, is a local community bound by a certain geography,\u201d says Ewing. \u201cBut I think that today when we have internet, we have social media, we have an app as well that promotes fan engagement, I feel like a community can be just shared ideals and shared values, and it can be global.\u201d \u2018Entrepreneurial spirit\u2019 Visiting Scotland and learning about the country\u2019s history was an \u201camazing\u201d experience for Mujtaba Elgoodah, one of the club\u2019s lead investors, he remembers. More used to basketball than soccer, Elgoodah was the manager of team development for the Golden State Warriors when they won the 2022 NBA title and is now part of the National Basketball Players\u2019 Association executive leadership team. But, when braving the bitterly cold Scottish weather to visit the club in February, he discovered \u201cthere is nothing like a good football match,\u201d Elgoodah tells CNN Sport. \u201cJust seeing the intensity and even picking up different slang words that the crowd was throwing out there was amazing too,\u201d he adds. Elgoodah had been intrigued by the Braves\u2019 story and ethos when he happened across their story on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, last year. He set about assembling a group of investors who could appreciate both soccer\u2019s potential for growth and the importance of community alongside his longtime investment partner Nassir Criss, a serial entrepreneur and venture capitalist. Together, they involved NWSL\u2019s Kansas City Current stars Elizabeth Ball, Kristen Hamilton and Hailie Mace with their wealth of soccer knowledge, and introduced Boston Celtics performance coach Isaiah Covington to Ewing after he had also noticed the club\u2019s story on social media. \u201cI didn\u2019t grow up around soccer,\u201d Covington recalls. \u201cBut in the last few years, I have a host of nieces and nephews and that\u2019s all they play now.\u201d Though still nowhere near as popular as American football or basketball, soccer is the fastest-growing sport in the US and the most popular choice for adults under the age of 30. As a high school sport alone, it has grown by almost 300% in the last 40 years. \u201cYou see \u2026 all these celebrities owning football clubs, it\u2019s kind of the new wave that people are on,\u201d Hamilton says. \u201cAnd so I think that that\u2019s been a really huge, powerful movement in the US saying, \u2018Hey, you know, we can\u2019t own an NFL team, but we can own a small football team.\u2019\u201d With its idea for lots of small investors helping it achieve huge ambitions, the Braves embodies an American style \u201centrepreneurial spirit,\u201d Criss tells CNN Sport. \u201cHow do we take something new that no one\u2019s ever really heard of, this wee club with massive ambitions to being a global franchise and pour in resources, community, people to actually accelerate that on a very big scale,\u201d he says. \u2018Flipping the narrative\u2019 As more and more money pours into soccer, the gap between fans and owners has become a cavern at many clubs. In the battle for soccer\u2019s soul, the two groups are often pitted against each other \u2013 the fans as representing the history and traditions of the sport, the owners cast as turning clubs into commercial entities or vehicles for sportswashing. Against this backdrop, fan ownership has emerged as somewhat of a utopian panacea for some fans. While it is still an unusual model in the UK, particularly in the English Premier League and Championship where clubs operate at huge losses, the Braves are not the first to pursue this goal. They were set up as a company limited by shares in 2022 meaning that fans can buy into it, and expect to file their first set of accounts in October.\u00a0Ewing founded a previous attempt at this ownership model from 2019 to 2021 but dissolved it before ever trading, he says. In Scotland, fans have become majority owners at topflight clubs St Mirren, Motherwell and Heart of Midlothian in recent years while several others, including Rangers and Celtic, count fans among their minority owners. In German soccer culture, meanwhile, the 50+1 concept of fan majority ownership is deeply entrenched thereby giving fans more of a say in the running of clubs, a model Ewing says he hopes to eventually emulate. But fan ownership isn\u2019t easy, namely working out how to marshal hundreds of opinions into some sort of coherent opinion. Ewing, who doesn\u2019t take a salary from the club, admits that managing expectations has proved challenging \u201cbecause people think they can just say, okay, let\u2019s do x, y, z.\u201d \u201cWith the best intentions in the world, it\u2019s maybe not as easy as that, but I think as well, the big thing for me is that people get to love the highs and the lows.\u201d The Braves have an app and Discord channel, helping to foster this sense of community and allowing fan owners to have a voice on the direction of the club. Fans picked the club\u2019s name, logo and the name of its ground \u2013 Alliance Park. Allowing fans this ownership over the team is proving infectious, its investors are finding. \u201cAnytime I ever post about the Braves \u2026 people will DM me and be like, \u201c\u2019Who\u2019s this team \u2026 and how do I get involved?\u2019\u201d Ball says. Such a project is a marked difference from Ewing\u2019s original venture, Edusport Academy, which he established in 2011, intending to provide a place for promising young soccer players, mostly from France, to hone their craft and learn English. As time went by, the academy\u2019s first team started playing in the Scottish soccer leagues and separated to form the Caledonian Braves in 2019. Now, as the Braves continue to grow, it has set its sights on rising up through the leagues but in a sustainable way that preserves the club for years to come. \u201c(We\u2019re) flipping the narrative that you don\u2019t have to be Tom Brady or Matthew McConaughey or Ryan Reynolds,\u201d says Ewing. \u201cYou can be anyone really from anywhere and you can also own a football club for as little as $100.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/29/sport/caledonian-braves-american-investors-scotland-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_sport_rose-zhang-founders-cup-korda-spt-intl", "text": "Rose Zhang surged to victory at the 2024 Cognizant Founders Cup on Sunday, as Nelly Korda fell short in her final two rounds to end her historic winning streak on the LPGA Tour. Zhang, 20, birdied four of her last five holes in her final round to finish two shots ahead of Sweden\u2019s Madelene Sagstr\u00f6m \u2013 with the duo finishing way ahead of the rest of the pack \u2013 at Upper Montclair Country Club. The American began Sunday a shot behind Sagstr\u00f6m, but produced some excellent, attacking golf to move ahead, maintain her lead and claim her second LPGA Tour victory. \u201cHonestly, today has been a roller coaster. I think from the start of the day, just coming out, it was raining, it was cold. I knew it was going to be a grind,\u201d Zhang, who finished 24-under par for the tournament, said afterwards. \u201cI think coming out I had those expectations of today I really have to find it in me to even play well, let alone win. \u201cAnd Madelene has been playing rock solid golf. She\u2019s been blowing away the field so just been trying to keep up. I think that was the mindset going in. I didn\u2019t have any expectations because I knew coming out here there was going to be a lot of golf to play. \u201cA lot of mistakes could have happened, can happen, and I just have to be able to take whatever I have out here. So that was the whole day. Starting from [hole] one, hit the pin and definitely did not expect that, but it was a nice little save. And going from there was able to hit some close. Gave me a little bit of momentum just in my own round.\u201d In June last year, Zhang became the first player in 72 years to win an LPGA tournament on her professional debut. She turned pro having become the most decorated player in the history of women\u2019s amateur golf, signing off by becoming the first women\u2019s golfer to ever win back-to-back individual NCAA national titles. Ever since her breakthrough victory at the Mizuho Americas Open last year, Zhang struggled to find consistency and that winning touch again. But the young star looked back to her best during the Founders Cup, putting in a complete performance in New Jersey as she carded rounds in the 60s in all four of her rounds; this was the first time she has done so since becoming an LPGA Tour member. Her statistics over the tournament highlighted her dominance, ranking first in most birdies, the most greens hit in regulation and the player who needed the fewest number of putts. After her victory on Sunday, Zhang spoke about the increased \u201cexpectations\u201d put on her \u201cto perform\u201d after what she did in her professional debut. \u201cSometimes, the noise did get to me a little bit, but I had such a good support group around me. I had people who really stuck in and told me to take it one at a time,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy to come out here. Didn\u2019t have any expectation of having to win because I realize that it\u2019s all just noise, and I have to be able to work at it myself and try my best to put myself in positions like this. But no matter what happened this week, I would\u2019ve been very satisfied and it reignited my passion for the game once again.\u201d Sunday\u2019s result ended Korda\u2019s dramatic, historic winning run after she emerged victorious in five consecutive tournaments earlier this year and was aiming for a sixth in a row, which would have earned her the outright record, at the Founders. However, despite a strong start to the tournament, the world No. 1 faded away as it progressed, eventually finishing tied for seventh and 17 shots behind Zhang. Even though her win-streak came to an end, Korda fondly reflected on her run after her finish at the Founders. \u201cYeah, gosh, hasn\u2019t even sunk in. Probably maybe now \u2013 or maybe in like 10, 15 years \u2013 it\u2019ll sink in,\u201d the 25-year-old told reporters. \u201cHopefully, someone beats it one day. \u201cBut just to do that with all the competition out here is super, super rewarding with how much work that I\u2019ve put in. So I think to get a streak like that in any sport in general is amazing with the amount of talent that I feel like every athlete has in their sport. \u201cJust an amazing feeling and, hopefully, one day it\u2019ll sink in.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/sport/rose-zhang-founders-cup-korda-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "sports"}}

The scores remained level for almost the entire first half before Ella Toone gave United the lead with a dazzling goal on the stroke of half-time, and Spurs collapsed in the second half to derail any hope of a comeback. \u201cWe are history makers for Manchester United,\u201d the club\u2019s manager Marc Skinner told the BBC. \u201cI didn\u2019t need to remind the owners of that, they know. There is a lot of support and love for our team and the growth. \u201cWe want to compete for titles but you all know how important adding that first piece of silverware is. We\u2019ve got nothing but growth ahead.\u201d Sunshine poured down onto the pitch, creating temperatures so hot that there was a drinks break in each half, and it remained even in the early exchanges, both sides not quite able to break down the other\u2019s defense. It seemed that the half would end goalless, that is until Toone created a little magic in its final moments. She evaded Eveliina Summanen\u2019s challenge, wrongfooting and swerving past her, before unleashing a powerful strike from outside the box that curled into the top right-hand corner of the net, past Becky Spencer\u2019s outstretched fingertips. United doubled its lead shortly after halftime, when Rachel Williams rose highest for Katie Zelem\u2019s perfectly weighted free-kick and headed the ball into the net, as she had been threatening to do all game.

Garc\u00eda still had time for a second goal, rifling the ball into the net after Lisa Naalsund had controlled Melvine Malard\u2019s chip into the box, and added some extra gloss to the scoreline.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/sport/manchester-united-fa-cup-tottenham-hotspur-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_05_sport_saudi-arabia-snooker-crucible-theatre-spt-intl", "text": "No one dares speak louder than a whisper as nearly 1,000 people respectfully take their seats inside the dimly lit Crucible Theatre. There is a sense of nervous excitement as those lucky enough to get their hands on a ticket cram into this historic venue in the heart of Sheffield, a city in the north of England. But they\u2019re not here to see a theatrical performance. They\u2019ve come to witness the nerve-shredding, silently electric atmosphere of the World Snooker Championship. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with snooker it\u2019s a sport that requires formidable patience and outstanding precision in equal measure. Think chess played on green baize rather than a checkered board. Players score points by potting a sequence of balls, looking to ruthlessly capitalize on an opponent\u2019s mistake. Matches can be long \u2013 the 1985 world final lasted over 14 hours \u2013 and the crowd watches in almost total silence, breaking into polite applause should a player pull off a  remarkable shot. The World Snooker Tour (WST) \u2013 organizers of the World Snooker Championship \u2013 say the sport is watched by half-a-billion people around the world. For the past 47 years, the historic Crucible Theatre has been the home of the annual tournament, a sporting nirvana which attracts people from around the world to its doors. \u201cIt\u2019s akin to Augusta and golf. Augusta is one of golf\u2019s spiritual outposts around the world and the Crucible is that for us,\u201d former snooker world champion Shaun Murphy tells CNN Sport behind the scenes of this year\u2019s tournament, which was won by England\u2019s Kyren Wilson on Monday. \u201cSnooker and Sheffield go together like peas and carrots, it\u2019s very special.\u201d But the venue\u2019s long affiliation with the tournament has seemingly come under threat from a source quite literally, and figuratively, thousands of miles away. As you walk through the spectacularly unspectacular bowls of the theatre, everyone is talking about the growing influence of Saudi Arabia on snooker. The Kingdom recently signed a lucrative deal with WST which some predict is a precursor to the event moving to Saudi Arabia once the current contract with the Crucible Theatre ends in 2027. It\u2019s a decision which might make business sense, but one that would tear the sport away from one of its spiritual homes, given the historical connection between snooker and the Crucible. \u2018Theatre of dreams\u2019 Getting off the train at Sheffield, a city made famous by its historic steel production, you might expect to be confronted by a wash of neon promotional material, advertising this year\u2019s championship. But while such events in other sports might trigger a festival-like atmosphere in its host city, the reality in Sheffield is somewhat different. In the place of jovial fans and buzzing excitement, there\u2019s a slow slog up the hill toward a somewhat nondescript building which blends into the sea of grey around it. While Sheffield locals go about their day as usual, a smattering of fans take refuge from the cold breeze in a conservatory opposite the venue where they queue up to test their ability with a number of snooker challenges. Many fans tell CNN how excited they are to be here, and that they\u2019ve been waiting all year to make the trip, but the noise levels never peak higher than a quiet murmur. For much of the year, the Crucible Theatre is home to an array of world class productions and is considered one of the best places to watch live theatre in England, if not the world. It\u2019s designed specifically with the audience in mind, with seats cascading down onto the thrust stage which has been home to Shakespearian tragedies and modern classics. Snooker was brought to this pocket of northern England by promoter Mike Watterson in 1977, after his wife had watched a play at the theatre and suggested it could be a good option to hold the championship. Even at that time, there were fears the venue would be too small to hold the two snooker tables needed to host the tournament, but the decision was made to give it a go. Now the 980-capacity arena could be sold out multiple times over, with the historic venue in desperate need of evolution. In a world where money is king, the Crucible Theatre is seemingly holding the business of the tournament back. This year, Iranian player Hossein Vafaei even said the venue \u201csmells really bad,\u201d a damning verdict for a space so loved by so many. But while its drab hallways perhaps could do with a lick of paint, the arena floor immediately grabs the eye. The two 12x6ft tables stand strong under the bright lights, covered by an immaculate green cloth. Every kink, every flick of chalk is enough to derail the players, so the pristine playing surface is closely monitored by a small team of experts \u2013 cared for like the green turf at Wembley Stadium. Snooker experienced its boom years here in the 1980s and these walls have crowned dozens of world champions throughout the decades. You can feel the history, and that\u2019s perhaps more important than anything money can buy. The arena\u2019s seats are closely wedged together and tower over the players as they take to the stage which lives up to its crucible name. Fans are so close to the players, it\u2019s as if they are part of the action. So close that they can see every furrowed brow from the players. \u201cEvery seat is a great seat, you feel like the crowd is right on top of you because that\u2019s how it\u2019s been designed,\u201d Murphy adds. \u201cThis place has been designed for performing and so when you get here, that atmosphere is just incredible.\u201d \u201cWe are very, very lucky. It\u2019s our theatre of dreams. Young players, like myself, when we started playing, we dreamt of doing it here. Like tennis players dream of doing it at Wimbledon.\u201d Money vs. Romanticism Like many fans attending this year, the 2005 world champion Murphy does not want the championship to move away from the Crucible Theatre, but he knows that romance and nostalgia alone will not be enough to keep the tournament at the venue. While Sheffield holds the memories, Saudi Arabia offers the key to larger prize money and bigger venues. The nation has disrupted the landscape of top-flight soccer and caused a bitter divide in professional golf. Snooker, it seems, could be next in line. \u201cUnfortunately, there is no real battle between nostalgia and business. There is no fight, really. Money wins everyday, that\u2019s the nature of the world,\u201d Murphy concedes, calling on Sheffield to build a bigger arena in the city. \u201cWith my snooker-lover\u2019s hat on, I don\u2019t want the World Championships to leave here at all but commercially we can\u2019t keep having our biggest event in our smallest venue.\u201d It\u2019s a sentiment shared, perhaps more brutally, by the game\u2019s biggest star, Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan. The Englishman is arguably the greatest player to ever pick up a snooker cue and has won seven world titles to date. His personality and unadulterated talent has seen him grow bigger than the game and he\u2019s frequently threatened to walk away from the sport unless it starts catching up. Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s influence He has been critical of the the Crucible Theatre in the past, wanting a touch more luxury from the venue. Perhaps ominously, O\u2019Sullivan recently signed a three-year deal with Saudi Arabia which will see him act as an ambassador for the sport in the nation. Speaking to reporters after his first-round victory at this year\u2019s event, the 48-year-old reiterated his stance that the respect for history should not stand in the way of progression. \u201cEach sport is a business, whether you like it or not. So you have to do what\u2019s right for you. We live in a competitive world so it\u2019s great because there is choice out there,\u201d he told journalists bluntly, showcasing a Saudi-owned sponsor on his sleeve. \u201cThe Saudis are a powerful outfit, same as China, they are serious players. Things get done very quickly. They\u2019re hard to turn down. \u201cFor me, I just want to play snooker, I want to be looked after, I want to be pampered. Anyone wants to pamper me, I\u2019m your man.\u201d Saudi Arabia has previously pushed back on allegations of \u201csportswashing,\u201d which involves countries using high-profile sporting events to project a favorable image of their country around the world, often to draw attention away from alleged wrongdoing. O\u2019Sullivan was quick to dismiss the notion that Saudi Arabia\u2019s human rights record would potentially put him off the venture, pointing instead to the wrongdoings of countries in the Western world. While the sport\u2019s biggest star remains open to a move, the tournament\u2019s organizer told CNN it was in talks with Sheffield city council about new plans for the venue but did say it was exploring all opportunities. \u201cFirstly, we love the Crucible and we absolutely share the connection which players and fans feel,\u201d WST chairman Steve Dawson said in a statement. \u201cIt is one of the great arenas in any sport worldwide and as soon as you walk through the door you feel the history and remember all the great moments that have played out on that stage. There is a very strong emotional attachment. \u201cWe have a responsibility to the players, the fans and the sport itself to consider all options regarding the future of the Championship after 2027, whether that means staying in Sheffield or moving the event elsewhere. \u201cWe are a rapidly growing sport and this is already a huge global event, the pinnacle of the season and a worldwide showcase of the sport. We will maximize its potential.\u201d While organizers, players and fans alike wax lyrical about what the Crucible Theatre means to snooker, there is a sense of inevitability around the venue this year that an era is slowly coming to an end. Saudi Arabia\u2019s pursuit of snooker should not be surprising, but moving the World Snooker Championship would be an emotional decision for many of its fans. In search of a more profitable future, though, snooker could be the latest sport to turn to Saudi for help. Either way, it seems like the Crucible Theatre might get left in the rear-view mirror if it doesn\u2019t keep up with the sport\u2019s new demands.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/05/sport/saudi-arabia-snooker-crucible-theatre-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "sports"}}

It\u2019s not clear precisely what McGregor was referring to, but this post, was viewed more than 19 million times on X, formerly known as Twitter. It was later followed by a series of tweets about immigration which were then circulated amongst Telegram channels, seen by CNN to have links to the far-right. As far back as 2022, McGregor had expressed his support for people protesting against immigration. The day after McGregor\u2019s war tweet, a stabbing outside a school in central Dublin left three children and an adult injured. Hours later, rioters with links to the far-right descended on the city. While local media later reported the alleged attacker was a naturalized Irish citizen who came to Ireland from Algeria in 2003, misinformation alleging the assailant was a foreign national had quickly spread online. Ciar\u00e1n O\u2019Connor, a senior analyst with the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a think tank that researches online hate and disinformation, told CNN that the far-right has grown in Ireland because of social media platforms such as X and Telegram which are commonly used by extremists. \u201cThe far-right are promoting McGregor as the voice of the people, taking advantage of his platforms to boost their ideology,\u201d O\u2019Connor told CNN, adding that\u00a0he believes\u00a0McGregor\u2019s \u201ctweets in the lead up to the riot were a call to action against illegal immigration.\u201d The Telegram channels that had circulated McGregor\u2019s declaration of war the night before the stabbing claimed\u00a0asylum seekers\u00a0posed an innate, existential threat to Ireland\u2019s citizens. According to the Irish government,\u00a0around 500 rioters spilled into the streets of Dublin and the rampage quickly turned violent. Police cars, buses and trams were set on fire. Rioters threw fireworks, flares and bottles injuring police officers, while shops were looted causing \u201ctens of millions\u201d of euros in damage. One protester could be seen on video holding a sign reading \u201cIrish Lives Matter,\u201d while others were heard chanting anti-immigrant slogans, as \u201cget them out\u201d reverberated around the nation\u2019s capital in a night of violence. Paul Murphy, a TD \u2013 a member of the Irish parliament \u2013 from the People Before Profit party, who has had members of the far-right protest outside his home in Dublin for his outspoken\u00a0support of refugees, told CNN that \u201cin terms of active members of the far-right, there\u2019s between 200 to 300 between all far-right organizations: national, freedom party, Ireland first \u2013 form a multitude of micro far-right parties.\u201d Despite Ireland\u2019s two far-right parties, the Irish National Party and the Irish Freedom Party, respectively received around\u00a00.2% and 0.3% of the vote in the 2020 general election, Murphy said the far-right are a small but growing minority. This comes after the Garda \u2013 as Ireland\u2019s police are known \u2013 told CNN there were 231 anti-immigration related public gatherings in 2023. After the riot on November 23, 2023, police\u00a0commissioner\u00a0Drew Harris said, \u201cWhat is clear is that people have been radicalized through social media,\u201d before describing rioters as \u201ca complete lunatic hooligan faction driven by far-right ideology.\u201d As riots raged in Dublin, McGregor, posted on X, \u201cYou reap what you sow.\u201d Local media reported this triggered a police investigation into the UFC star and others for allegedly \u201cinciting hatred online.\u201d The Garda told CNN that they would not comment on McGregor\u2019s case. McGregor also took to social media to suggest\u00a0that he might run for [Irish] President. The seriousness of his online claim remains unclear, though in a subsequent post McGregor positioned himself as providing \u201cfresh skin in the game.\u201d \u201cThese parties govern themselves vs govern the people \u2026 I listen. I support. I adapt. I have no affiliation/bias/favoritism toward any party. They would genuinely be held to account regarding the current sway of public feeling \u2026 It would not be me in power as President, people of Ireland. It would be me and you,\u201d said McGregor. McGregor did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. However, following the Dublin riot the 35-year-old told the Guardian in a statement that, \u201cWe Irish are known for our beautiful hearts, and we have a proud history of not accepting racism.\u201d \u2018The Notorious Conor McGregor\u2019 The rise of McGregor is one of the most famous rags-to-riches stories in sports. A working-class boy from Dublin, McGregor was driven by a desire to become world champion in a sport relatively unknown in Ireland. As he started winning fights, the MMA octagon became McGregor\u2019s colosseum. He entertained spectators with his precise boxing style and his quick wit charmed an ever-growing fan base. \u201cThe Notorious\u201d Conor McGregor brand was born and, before long, he was the first person in history to hold two UFC belts simultaneously,\u00a0rising to become the world\u2019s highest paid sport star in 2021, according to Forbes. Yet McGregor was dogged by accusations of sexual assault, which he has denied, while a string of defeats to Khabib Nurmagomedov, Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Dustin Poirier left the fighter with one\u00a0title victory in the last eight years. With his fighting career in flux, McGregor has turned his attention to sparring with people on social media, which has touched a nerve in Ireland\u2019s political establishment. Political analysts and far-right experts have told CNN that McGregor\u2019s unique brand of Irish patriotism that won him supporters as a fighter has mutated into a strand of \u201cfar-right\u201d Irish nationalism. \u201cFar-right figures who do promote ethnonationalism \u2013 of Ireland for the Irish \u2013 celebrate when McGregor is becoming more aligned with their brand of nationalism,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. McGregor has become \u201ca vocal anti-immigration influencer and is using his enormous reach and influence to encourage hostility and suspicion of migrants and asylum seekers,\u201d he added. McGregor has been accused by some Irish politicians of fanning the flames of discontent online, voicing his anger at Ireland\u2019s immigration policy and asking questions that strike at the core of Irish consciousness: does Ireland, a country with its long history of emigration, remain a country that welcomes people seeking refuge? \u201cI think these tweets are incredibly irresponsible for someone who has ten million followers on Twitter alone to be whipping up this level of poison and hate,\u201d Labour Justice spokesperson Aodh\u00e1n \u00d3 R\u00edord\u00e1in told RT\u00c9 News last year. McGregor has said he\u2019s being made a \u201cscapegoat.\u201d The former UFC champion appears to have picked his corner, in the fight for Ireland\u2019s soul, but whether he is willingly or unwillingly platforming \u201cfar-right\u201d views remains unclear. \u201cWhen he first came to prominence in 2012, he got attention by acting like a clown \u2013 and people received him well,\u201d Ewan MacKenna, who authored the book \u201cChaos is a Friend of Mine: The Life and Crimes of Conor McGregor,\u201d told CNN. \u201cHe will become whatever the crowd wants him to be and he molds himself into whatever brings him the most attention, and with politics, it would be similar.\u201d McGregor has previously claimed he regularly deletes his posts on X for \u201cpersonal\u201d reasons but has also said: \u201cMy statements, widely publicised, stand.\u201d \u2018We all go to war\u2019 McGregor\u2019s UFC slogan was once: \u201cWhen one of us go to war, we all go to war,\u201d and the MMA fighter has continued to evoke war imagery in recent months. \u201cMcGregor, when he first came onto the [MMA] scene, he used his sense of Irishness to portray an image of a fighting Irish warrior, but in the last couple of months, he has pivoted this towards ethno-nationalism and this idea that Ireland must protect itself from refugees,\u201d said O\u2019Connor. In a later post, now deleted by McGregor, the fighter reacted to footage of a bus of asylum seekers, writing: \u201cPeople of the community are not told who these men are. Or why they are here. This is what I mean when I say we are at war. You cannot expect the people of Ireland to tolerate this. We will not.\u201d In a separate, now deleted post on X, the UFC star said: \u201cDo not let any Irish property be took over unannounced. Evaporate said property. It\u2019s a war.\u201d Since November 2018 , there have been a number of instances when properties or locations linked,\u00a0 to the housing of people seeking asylum or international protection were set on fire, according to analysis by Irish media. The UFC star, in a now deleted post, said: \u201cI stand with the people of the East Wall,\u201d in reference to protests which started in Dublin\u2019s East Wall district in November 2022 over plans to house refugees in a disused office block. McGregor\u2019s tweet was then circulated widely in Telegram channels with links to the far-right. Ireland, a country of just over five million people, saw 141,600 immigrants arrive on its shores in the year leading up to April 2023 \u2013 the highest figure in 16 years with some attracted by its strong economic performance (9.4% real GDP growth in 2022), according to the Central Statistics Office Ireland (CSO). In 2020, Ireland was ranked in the Migration Policy Index\u2019s top 10 of countries for having \u201ca comprehensive approach to integration, which fully guarantees equal rights, opportunities and security for immigrants and citizens.\u201d But for many ordinary workers,\u00a0the benefits are failing to reach their pockets\u00a0and they struggle are struggling to afford high housing prices and rents. This leaves many without a stake in society, or a home to live in, and so Ireland is often seen as a nation of exiles, with more than 64,000 people leaving its shores to try their hand at a life elsewhere over the same time period. Matthew Donoghue, a professor in social policy at University College Dublin, told CNN socio-economic inequality can create a \u201csense of insecurity that the far-right have become adept at exploiting for their own gain, scapegoating people and groups who are facing exactly the same pressures.\u201d \u201cThe pressures people feel can be a result of complex political, economic and social factors but instead the far-right offer a simple - but incorrect - narrative of blame,\u201d he added. In November, McGregor shared, before unsharing, an X post by anti-immigration Irish influencer Mick O\u2019Keefe about residents in rural Ireland putting up a checkpoint to deter asylum seekers from entering local areas. O\u2019Keefe regularly writes to McGregor on X, calling him \u201cPresident McGregor.\u201d O\u2019Keefe did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. AI-generated images of McGregor have also circulated online, showing him bare-chested, holding a rifle and leading a mob of armed Irishmen. In one video posted on X, Keith Woods, an Irish anti-immigration influencer, lambasts Ireland\u2019s new hate speech laws, claiming they are a way to silence people speaking out against immigration. The same video then shows an AI-generated image of McGregor wearing a crown on his head, wrapped in an Irish tricolor. Woods has appeared on far-right agitator Nick Fuentes\u2019 \u201cAmerica First\u201d show. During a separate show, Fuentes \u2013 an American White nationalist and Holocaust denier \u2013 said that McGregor should \u201crise up\u201d and \u201csalvage [Ireland] because it\u2019s going to be either the Irish or it\u2019s going to be the Blacks,\u201d before adding: \u201cOnly one side is going to come out of this thing alive.\u201d McGregor, who follows Woods on X, has liked his posts in the past, including one where Woods quoted Irish 1916 patriot Padraig Pearse saying, \u201cIreland belongs to the Irish.\u201d The phrase has become the new slogan of the far-right Irish National Party, for which Woods has been seen canvassing and holding the party\u2019s banner. Woods did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Harnessing social media As recently as 2019, Foreign Policy said that Ireland was one of Europe\u2019s \u201clast countries without extreme nationalists in parliament.\u201d But the Dublin riots and subsequent protests have cast the spotlight on the emergence of a new right-wing strain of politics and its amplification on social media. Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, told CNN that \u201cfar-right groups in Ireland are harnessing Twitter (now known as X) to spread their messages in the same way far-right groups do so in other parts of the EU.\u201dBut she added: \u201cIt is true that Ireland\u2019s far right is less developed than in places like Germany and France, where there are rising political parties of this persuasion, or in Italy, Sweden, and other countries where the far right is part of the governing majority.\u201dDonoghue added, \u201cthere is a larger (yet small) base of committed activists using social media, especially that they are able to organize more effectively than before. However, it is very important to note that they are roundly rejected by the vast majority of the Irish population.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/sport/conor-mcgregor-figurehead-far-right-ireland-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_04_22_sport_scottie-scheffler-rbc-heritage-win-spt-intl", "text": "You know the drill by now. A golf tournament is staged. After four rounds the tournament concludes. Scottie Scheffler poses with the winner\u2019s trophy. Just a week on from conquering a windswept Masters, the world No. 1 mastered the elements once more at a stormy RBC Heritage to reel in his fourth win in his last five starts. Thunderstorms in South Carolina had delayed Sunday\u2019s action for two-and-a-half hours before play was suspended due to darkness, leaving Scheffler to return to Harbor Town Golf Links on Monday to finish his last three holes. Carrying a five-stroke advantage, a closing bogey served up no jeopardy, as the American carded a three-under-68 to finish on 19-under overall, three shots ahead of compatriot Sahith Theegala. It seals Scheffler\u2019s 10th PGA Tour title and a tied career-high fourth of the season as the 27-year-old continues to exert a level of dominance that is drawing increasing parallels to Tiger Woods\u2019 seemingly perpetual presence in the winner\u2019s circle across the 2000\u2019s. No golfer since Woods in 2006 had won a PGA Tour event the week after triumph at a major, while you would have to go back as far as Bernhard Langer in 1985 to find the last, and only previous, time that a golfer followed up victory at Augusta National with a win at Harbor Town. \u201cI didn\u2019t show up here just to have some sort of ceremony and have people tell me congratulations,\u201d Scheffler told reporters Monday. \u201cI came here with a purpose. Got off to a slow start but after that played some really nice golf.\u201d \u2018Hopefully I\u2019ll be a good Dad\u2019 Questions over whether Scheffler would tee up at the tournament had only proliferated given the imminent arrival of his first child, with wife Meredith expected to give birth within the next few weeks. The Texan had vowed to abandon his pursuit of a second career major at the Masters if his wife went into labor and stayed in close family contact this week, calling his partner on Sunday evening and seeking out parents Scott and Diane after tapping home for victory Monday. \u201cHopefully I\u2019ll be a good Dad. I\u2019m going to do my best,\u201d said Scheffler, whose sister is also pregnant. \u201cI was talking to Meredith on the phone last night, and we were both kind of like, \u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s officially hit us yet that we\u2019re going to be parents.\u2019 I\u2019ll definitely be leaning on my parents for a good amount of advice. They did a great job raising me and my three sisters. \u201cThey\u2019re still a big part of our lives. This will be their second grandchild and they\u2019ll have their third one on the way right after that \u2026 It\u2019s an exciting time for Meredith and me, it\u2019s an exciting time for the rest of our family. We\u2019re looking forward to this next journey in our life together.\u201d The most dominant force in golf right now? Not quite. Even the sole event Scheffler hasn\u2019t won in his last five appearances was a runner-up finish, as he missed out by two shots to Germany\u2019s Stephan Jaeger at the Texas Children\u2019s Houston Open in March. To put his supremacy into context, the world ranking points gap between Scheffler (629.6) and his closest chaser Rory McIlroy (344.4) is wider than that of the Northern Irishman to world No.784 Woods (4.64), who has made just five competitive appearances since the start of 2023. Only two players had ever previously won or finished runner-up in five consecutive PGA Tour starts; Vijay Singh in 2004, and Woods on three separate occasions between 1999 and 2008. Remarkably though, it\u2019s not even the best streak in golf right now. Compatriot Nelly Korda triumphed at the Chevron Championship on Sunday to stretch her winning run to five in a row, clinching her second major and equaling the LPGA Tour record for consecutive victories. As the 25-year-old women\u2019s world No. 1 prepares to chase a historic sixth this week, Scheffler is throwing in the towel \u2013 but not before one last jab. \u201cOne of the people here asked me, \u2018Is this turning into a competition between you and Nelly?\u2019 and I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t know, man, I think if it\u2019s a competition she\u2019s got me pretty beat right now\u2019,\u201d Scheffler said. \u201cShe had that tied-16th at the beginning of the year, which was just terrible. I can\u2019t believe she did that,\u201d he added with a wry smile. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty special stuff. To win four times in a row and then show up at a major championship and win is extremely impressive, so I\u2019m extremely happy for her \u2026 Obviously some great golf, some historic stuff, and hopefully she keeps it up.\u201d Scheffler has a long way to go if he wants to claim the PGA Tour record for successive wins. Fellow Texan Byron Nelson cemented his status as one of the game\u2019s legendary figures with a staggering run of 11 straight victories between March and August 1945, including major triumph at the PGA Championship.

The atmosphere inside Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis belied the less important nature of a preseason game, the crowd whooping loudly as Clark made her first home bucket on a driving layup in the first half. Clark finished with 12 points, eight rebounds and six assists but had a difficult shooting night, going 4-of-12 from the field and 2-of-9 from deep. \u201cI don\u2019t think I was that effective, honestly,\u201d Clark told reporters after the game. \u201cI thought more than anything I did a really good job of passing the ball, finding my teammates. \u201cI think I got into the paint, obviously, I would have liked to make a couple more threes, but sometimes, that\u2019s how you shoot it. \u201cWe really responded after we kind of had a slow start. Obviously, we don\u2019t want to have slow starts, but it\u2019s good to see us be able to respond and take the lead back and grind it out until the end.\u201d NaLyssa Smith led the way for the Fever, scoring 21 points and grabbing six rebounds, as Indiana came back from a 15-point, second-quarter deficit to take the lead with 4:57 left in the third and never looked back.

With Inter Miami 2-0 down against Montr\u00e9al on Saturday, Messi was off the pitch when his team needed someone to take a free-kick. The Argentine had received on-field treatment moments earlier in the first half following a tackle from defender George Campbell, which had led to the free-kick being awarded, and then walked off the pitch. The situation brought the MLS\u2019 \u201cOff-Field Treatment Rule,\u201d introduced in April, into play. According to the rules: \u201cIf a player with a suspected injury remains on the ground for more than 15 seconds, the referee will stop play and wave the medical crew onto the field to evaluate the player. \u201cWhen safe, the player will be removed from the field and remain off the field for a minimum of two minutes for further assessment and treatment.\u201d Unable to return to the pitch, Messi turned towards a television camera on the sidelines, shook his head and said in Spanish: \u201cWith these type of rules \u2026\u201d The moment has been widely shared on social media. The 36-year-old was not missed during the free kick, however, as Mat\u00edas Rojas took it and scored in the top-right corner to reduce the deficit to 2-1, sparking a comeback. Miami eventually celebrated a 3-2 victory, the team\u2019s fifth consecutive league win which extends its unbeaten run to seven games. Luis Su\u00e1rez and Benjamin Cremaschi were the other scorers on a night when Messi did not find the net. After the match, Miami coach Gerardo Martino told reporters that there were rules that \u201cmust be revised.\u201d According to the rule book, the two-minute rule would not have taken effect had Campbell received a yellow or red card for the foul on Messi. \u201cExceptions to the Off-Field Treatment Rule include instances of potential head injury, goalkeeper injuries, serious medical events, and fouls resulting in yellow or red cards,\u201d the rule states. \u201cIn Leo\u2019s situation, he was clearly fouled,\u201d Martino said, per ESPN. \u201cThe player deserved a yellow card, which would mean Messi would\u2019ve never left the field for two minutes. \u201cAs I understand it, the team that suffered the foul was punished. With these new rule changes, there are situations that must be revised. The infraction was clear and was a yellow card, and ultimately it was us that lost Leo for two minutes.\u201d CNN has contacted the MLS for comment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/sport/lionel-messi-mls-rule-change-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "sports"}}

After going down 0-2 in the series following surprising back-to-back home defeats, the defending champion Nuggets have now wrestled homecourt advantage back from Minnesota with two straight road wins as the teams head back to Colorado. Only five teams in NBA history have come back to win a best-of-seven series when losing the first two at home. All five won Games 3 and 4 on the road, as Denver has done. It was another impressive victory for Nuggets, who took the lead for the first time towards the end of the first quarter and then never gave it up. Denver opened up a 15-point advantage at the half after a nightmare end to the second quarter for the Timberwolves. After a turnover allowed Michael Porter Jr. to score a breakaway dunk with just 1.6 seconds remaining, Nickeil Alexander-Walker tried to quickly inbounds the ball in the hope of giving Minnesota a chance of a final bucket before the horn, but threw the pass straight to Nuggets guard Jamal Murray. Murray heaved the ball from way beyond the half-court line and hit nothing but net, sucking the energy out of Target Center and leaving several fans with their head in their hands. Denver\u2019s lead swelled to as much as 18 in the third quarter, before the Timberwolves cut the deficit to as little as six points down the stretch, though it felt like the experienced Nuggets always kept their opponents at arm\u2019s length. \u201c\u2018Never underestimate the heart of a champion,\u2019\u201d Nuggets head coach Michael Malone said, per ESPN, quoting former Houston Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich. \u201cThey were quick to write us off, but these guys, we won a championship a year ago. \u201cWe went into Miami [in the NBA Finals], won two games in a row. This team has been tested time and time again, and we found a way to solve whatever\u2019s been thrown at us. This series is a long way from being over. We\u2019re not celebrating. \u201cIt\u2019s 2-2 \u2026 but what I found about our group is that they do believe in themselves and more importantly, they believe in the man next to them. We have a group that is acting as you would hope a championship team would act.\u201d Denver was led by 35 points, seven rebounds, seven assists and three steals from newly-crowned three-time MVP Nikola Joki\u0107, while Aaron Gordon had a near-perfect night with 27 points on 11-of-12 shooting \u2013 including 2-of-2 from three-point range \u2013 to go with seven rebounds, six assists and two blocks. Joki\u0107 called Gordon Denver\u2019s \u201cbest player\u201d in Sunday\u2019s victory. For the Timberwolves, rising superstar Anthony Edwards continued his impressive playoff performances with a huge 44-point night on 64% shooting, but it just wasn\u2019t enough to power Minnesota to a comeback win. Karl-Anthony Towns had a double-double with 13 points and 12 rebounds but was held to a miserly 27.8% shooting by Denver\u2019s improved defense. Towns said Murray\u2019s absurd shot just before the half \u201churt\u201d the team. \u201cWe made a good run to get ourselves back in the game and got some momentum, put some juice in the building, and then they did what the defending champs do,\u201d he said, per ESPN. \u201cIt definitely sent us to halftime with a bad taste in our mouth, so we just got to be better next time.\u201d The teams now head back to Denver for Tuesday\u2019s Game 5, before returning to Minnesota for Game 6 on Thursday. Pacers cruise to level series against Knicks In the Eastern Conference semifinals, the Indiana Pacers earned a statement 121-89 win over the New York Knicks to level the series at 2-2. Star guard Tyrese Haliburton lit up Gainbridge Fieldhouse with a game-high 20 points \u2013 tied with the Knicks\u2019 Alec Burks \u2013 to go with six rebounds and five assists. Six Pacers players scored in double figures as both teams sat their starters early in the blowout victory. The series returns to New York for Game 5 on Tuesday and then back to Indianapolis for Game 6 on Friday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/sport/denver-nuggets-minnesota-timberwolves-jamal-murray-game-4-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_sport_hattan-alsaif-mma-saudi-arabia-spt-intl", "text": "Hattan Alsaif has grown accustomed to sparring with men. Rarely shy about confronting heavier, stronger opponents, she knows what it\u2019s like to absorb blow after blow until tears begin to shine in her eyes, her face red and hot from crying. As one of the few women at her gym in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia \u2013 and the only woman hopeful of fighting at an elite level \u2013 Alsaif had little choice but to train with and against her male counterparts when she first took up martial arts. She credits her sometimes brutal introduction to the sport as one of the reasons for her success. \u201cI was the only girl doing it day and night, day and night, day and night,\u201d Alsaif told CNN Sport. \u201cI always spar with guys, I train with guys, I\u2019m always with the guys in the gym. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy thing, so when it comes to the cage, when I get a hit from a girl, I feel like, \u2018Whoa, is this all you\u2019ve got?\u2019\u201d The 22-year-old had already made history in MMA, even before her atomweight bout against Egypt\u2019s Nada Faheem on Friday, which she won by knock out in the second round. In January, Alsaif signed a contract with the Professional Fighters League (PFL), making her the first woman from Saudi Arabia to join a global MMA promotion. It was a notable moment in a country known for its socially conservative attitudes, where sporting opportunities have historically been limited for women. The Saudi women\u2019s soccer team only played its first match two years ago, while a domestic soccer league wasn\u2019t established until 2020. Alsaif is acutely aware of her status as a trailblazer for female MMA fighters in Saudi Arabia and takes such a responsibility seriously. \u201cIt\u2019s big, to be honest, because I\u2019m going to be carrying this thing my entire life,\u201d she said, speaking to CNN before her MMA debut fight on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit heavy to carry it, but I\u2019m excited and proud to be the person to do it.\u201d Alsaif endured a difficult upbringing, orphaned at the age of 10 after both of her parents died in a short space of time. She says she battled depression during her teenage years before finding solace in martial arts, helping her to discover a sense of purpose and peace. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a normal childhood or an easy childhood because of the loss of my parents,\u201d said Alsaif. \u201cBut after God, martial arts helped me a lot \u2013 so, so, so much. It changed my life 100% for the better. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m so addicted to martial arts. I don\u2019t want to stop doing [it] because it\u2019s just the thing that makes me feel alive. I feel I\u2019m alive when I train, when I fight, in the gym \u2013 I can feel my soul alive. \u201cWhen I breathe after the rounds, when I feel sick, when I feel tired, when I feel courage, when I feel scared, those moments, every part of that, it makes me feel alive. It\u2019s something that means a lot to me.\u201d Growing up, Alsaif had always loved extreme, adrenaline-fueled sports, and her curiosity to try something new took her to a boxing gym in her local neighborhood. That piqued her interest, but she soon found that the boxing class she was attending lacked rigor and professionalism. Then, after seeing videos of Saudi MMA fighter Abdullah Al-Qahtani on social media, the pair exchanged messages and Alsaif was invited to try the sport for herself. \u201cI started looking at the guys, and they were hitting the bags with kicks and elbows and knees,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI was like, they have more weapons than I do. I only have hands [in boxing]. I felt so jealous \u2026 I love to do the things that have more power.\u201d Alsaif started to compete in Muay Thai \u2013 the stand-up, striking combat sport originating in Thailand \u2013 and went on to win titles at the World Combat Games, the Saudi Games and the International Federation of Muaythai Associations (IFMA) World Championships under the guidance of coach Feras Sadaa. Sadaa, coach of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Muay Thai national team, has been central to Alsaif\u2019s success, though his influence extends far beyond a sporting sphere. \u201cAll these years, I never felt what [having a] father means at all,\u201d said Alsaif. \u201cAnd he was a gift from God. He did everything with me. He helped me in every situation, in the gym or outside of the gym. \u201cHe was like family. He always told anyone else that Hattan is not just my student, Hattan is one of my kids \u2026 I wish to make him so happy [and] represent him in the best way I can.\u201d Friday\u2019s fight card in Riyadh, headlined by Al-Qahtani, was Alsaif\u2019s first chance to assess whether she was able to translate her Muay Thai prowess into success in an MMA cage. The event, part of the PFL\u2019s growing prominence in the region, featured fighters from across the Middle East and North Africa, less than three months since Claressa Shields and Kelsey De Santis contested the first professional female MMA bout in Saudi Arabia. Last year, SURJ Sports Investments Company, which is owned by Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF), acquired a minority stake in the PFL, part of the PFL\u2019s strategy to recruit more fighters and attract more fans in the MENA region. Alsaif never envisioned herself becoming an MMA pioneer when she took her first curious steps into a combat gym, but said that she wants to leave a legacy in the sport. Her upcoming bout is the first step towards achieving that goal and also an opportunity to reflect on all that she has overcome during her short time as an MMA fighter. She does that between rounds in the gym, wiping any tears from her eyes and reminding herself of the effort and energy she has so far devoted to her pursuit. \u201cI start looking at myself in the mirror and I\u2019d be like, \u2018You have killed yourself; you have cried; you have sacrificed everything,\u2019\u201d said Alsaif. \u201c\u2018You are really strong; you are your own role model\u2019 \u2026 It does give me a lot of motivation.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/sport/hattan-alsaif-mma-saudi-arabia-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_04_26_sport_aya-nakamura-france-culture-wars-paris-2024-spt-intl", "text": "Aya Nakamura was born in the former French colony of Mali, raised in France and is\u00a0widely considered\u00a0the most streamed female Francophone artist in the world. The 28-year-old,\u00a0as well as being Malian,\u00a0is a French citizen, and a multiple-platinum-selling pop star who was brought up in the Parisian suburbs. However,\u00a0ahead of Paris 2024, Nakamura finds herself at the\u00a0center\u00a0of France\u2019s culture wars. Amid widespread\u00a0rumors\u00a0the singer would\u00a0perform at the Games\u2019 Opening Ceremony, singing an Edith Piaf song,\u00a0some members of France\u2019s far-right have questioned\u00a0whether she embodies French heritage, values and identity.\u00a0Piaf is a key figure in France\u2019s musical \u2013 and national \u2013 identity. \u201cThere\u2019s no way Aya. This is Paris, not the market\u00a0in\u00a0Bamako,\u201d said fringe\u00a0and extreme\u00a0far-right group Les Natifs (Natives) on X, formerly known\u00a0as Twitter, in March, referring to Mali\u2019s capital. Nakamura has defended herself on social media, saying on X: \u201cI\u2019m becoming the number one state subject in debates\u00a0\u2026but what do I really owe you all? Nothing.\u201d The singer has received support from Rachida Dati, France\u2019s Minister of Culture, who spoke out in defence of Nakamura, saying \u201cbe careful of the pretext of attacking someone out of pure racism.\u201d Paris 2024\u2019s organizing committee told CNN: \u201cWe were very shocked by the racist attacks against Aya Nakamura in recent days. We offer our full support to the most listened-to French artist in the world.\u201d Whether Nakamura will perform at the Olympics\u2019 opening ceremony is still unconfirmed, with the Paris 2024 organizing committee telling CNN that they\u00a0\u201cwon\u2019t be confirming or denying\u201d\u00a0any rumors or reports, to \u201cleave room for surprises\u201d on the day. CNN has reached out to Nakamura but she declined to\u00a0be interviewed\u00a0on the matter. \u2018She contributes to French culture\u2019 However, many others in France are all too keen to comment on this cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. Far-right politician Marion Mar\u00e9chal,\u00a0who is the niece\u00a0of far-right National Rally party leader\u00a0Marine Le Pen and a member of the\u00a0Reconqu\u00eate\u00a0party, told French\u00a0television stations BMFTV and Europe 1\u00a0that Nakamura\u00a0\u201cdoes not sing in French,\u201d referencing the blend of Parisian and African\u00a0derived slang\u00a0that often feature in her lyrics. \u201cI think that the people who criticize her actually don\u2019t accept that she embodies France,\u201d\u00a0French activist Rokhaya Diallo told CNN. \u201cThe\u00a0slang she uses is used by young people and a lot of young French people use slang.\u201d Nakamura often uses a mix of verlan and African derived slang from languages such as Bambara, from her birth country Mali,\u00a0in her music. Her number one hit song\u00a0\u201cDjadja,\u201d\u00a0contains the lyric \u201cle monde est tit-pe\u201d \u2013 the world is small \u2013 with word \u2018tit-pe\u2019 inverting the French word \u2018petit.\u2019 Verlan, a type of French slang named after\u00a0the inversion of the French word \u2018l\u2019envers\u2019 \u2013 meaning backwards \u2013 originates from the outskirts of Paris known as \u2018la cit\u00e9\u2019 (the suburbs)\u00a0that have had\u00a0large\u00a0immigrant population. At the inauguration of the\u00a0Olympic Aquatics Centre\u00a0earlier this month, French President Emanuel Macron\u00a0said that Nakamura \u201cspeaks to a good number of our compatriots\u201d and claimed that \u201cthese\u00a0games and ceremonies should reflect us, and she contributes to French culture, to French music.\u201d \u201cI want to defend here these choices and defend the fact that there must be artistic freedom and that politics should not interfere,\u201d added Macron. In an interview with France Inter,\u00a0Macron\u2019s political rival Le Pen, known for her right-wing views, claimed that the President was seeking to \u201coutrage\u201d and \u201chumiliate the French people\u201d when asked whether she thinks Nakamura opening the games would be a\u00a0good symbol. When asked to further explain why this choice would be a humiliation, Le Pen responded \u201cshe does not sing in French, or a foreign language, she sings nonsense.\u201d Speaking to CNN, Professor of Political Science at the University of Nice,\u00a0Vincent\u00a0Martigny, said that\u00a0while\u00a0there are those who believe it is right to promote minorities and their role in French culture, there are others, who hold more traditional views, which he terms as racist in relation to the country\u2019s colonial past. 1998 World Cup There have been moments of\u00a0perceived\u00a0unity in France\u2019s past, notably when the men\u2019s national soccer team won the 1998 World Cup. That triumph helped popularise the slogan \u201cBlack, Blanc, Beur\u201d \u2013 Black, White, Arab\u00a0\u00a0\u2013\u00a0amid a push for unity and inclusion. Beur\u2019 is verlan for the French word \u2018arabe.\u2019 France\u2019s World Cup winning team of 1998\u00a0was made up of a\u00a0diverse\u00a0group\u00a0of players,\u00a0not only of European descent but also from the ex-colonies of France\u00a0and other countries.\u00a0Many thought\u00a0at the time\u00a0that the 1998 team was a sign of a truly integrated, multi-cultural France. But notable social and cultural divisions have emerged in France in recent years. There have been\u00a0multiple bans and restrictions against Islamic dress. The nationwide ban on\u00a0public\u00a0schoolchildren wearing abayas,\u00a0was\u00a0denounced as an \u201cIslamophobic campaign\u201d by\u00a0one\u00a0politician\u00a0on the left.\u00a0Athletes have been banned\u00a0from wearing a hijab while competing representing France\u00a0at the Paris\u00a0Olympic Games. Then there have been multiple protests and riots over police brutality leading to the death of\u00a0some French inhabitants of North and West African heritage\u00a0from the suburbs of Paris, fueling backlash over policing methods in marginalized communities. Nakamura\u2019s\u00a0birth\u00a0country\u00a0of Mali is one of the many\u00a0former\u00a0French colonies. There are millions of French citizens, like Nakamura, who are either themselves immigrants or descendants of immigrants from\u00a0nations formerly colonized by France. These days France\u00a0finds itself embroiled in a very public debate over the recognition and acceptance of its immigrants as the country continues to reckon with its colonial history. Professor Martigny believes that the\u00a0nationalist\u00a0party is \u201cstronger than ever\u201d and that nationalists in France are \u201cmore nationalist\u201d and more open with their views today than they were in the past. Activist Diallo also believes that France is struggling to see itself \u201cas it is\u201d and recognize non-White individuals as fully French. \u201cDespite her successes, despite her undeniable achievements, we still think that it\u2019s not an honor for us to have such a woman represent us,\u201d Diallo told CNN, referring to Nakamura. \u2018The Great Replacement\u2019 theory Political scientist Oliver Roy, who is Professor\u00a0at the EUI School of Transnational Governance, told CNN that a common belief that could be fuelling the culture wars in France is an ideology\u00a0expressed\u00a0\u201cnot just [by] the extreme right, but also part of the traditional centre right\u201d known as \u201cthe great replacement.\u201d He describes\u00a0the term\u00a0as \u201cthe idea that there is a new population coming from the south, which is replacing the old traditional, French population.\u201d However, he maintains that this fear \u201cis not supported by demography, [or] by statistics, and is, of course, very ideological.\u201d According to Martigny, France\u2019s cultural divisions are amplified on social media by both extremes of the political spectrum. \u201cBecause of the social networks, public debates are more violent on these issues than they used to be,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a theatre for the expression of extremely strong minded, sometimes racist, very often offensive comments on Twitter, on X, and on other social networks,\u201d added Martigny. \u201cYou have a lot of X accounts who are really, really, really pro far-right. And so they played a role in discussing these issues and making it a controversy. And then this controversy is exported to the traditional media.\u201d \u2018Show a very optimistic face for France\u2019 As Nakamura was targeted by fringe and extreme far-right groups as well as far-right politicians, in an interview\u00a0with BMFTV and RMC,\u00a0Macron said that \u201cthe reactions shocked me \u2026 there\u00a0were\u00a0truly racist reactions.\u201d However,\u00a0Martigny says he sees\u00a0Macron\u2019s condemnation of the attacks as racist as an attempt to balance the scales after the passing of\u00a0what the professor called\u00a0a \u201cvery restrictive law on immigration\u201d a few months ago. In December, Macron passed a controversial bill calling for tougher immigration that was endorsed by the far-right, and rejected by many in his own camp. Politicians such as Le Pen hailed the legislation as an \u201cideological victory\u201d whilst French health Minister, Aurelien Rousseau resigned in protest.\u00a0It included many amendments tightening immigration laws, one of which dictated children born to foreign parents on French soil would no longer become automatic French citizens but would have to apply for citizenship. \u201cHe needs to make that forgotten in a certain way by showing that he has a sense of balance on these issues,\u201d\u00a0Martigny states. By promoting Nakamura, Martigny believes that Macron\u2019s ambitions may have been to \u201cshow a very optimistic face for France.\u201d \u201c[There are] very strong cultural wars in France revolving around pop stars, and the type of pop stars that you can mobilize or the type of artists that you can mobilize when you want to unite the country.\u201d With less than 100 days to go until the Olympics, many hope Paris 2024 will give France the opportunity to show unity. However, the heated reactions to Nakamura hints at a more pessimistic outlook.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/26/sport/aya-nakamura-france-culture-wars-paris-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "sports"}}

You have the young guys who are coming up \u2026 they\u2019re all incredibly hungry and fit and fast. \u201cBut I use my adaptability to adjust my tactics and my game to them and understand really what it takes, you know, what it takes to stay at the top and compete with these guys and try to win more titles.\u201d Djokovic was awarded his Laureus award by NFL great Tom Brady after a remarkable 2023 season where he won three out of the four grand slams. The pair have grown close over the years and Brady praised his friend for not only being an \u201camazing player and talent\u201d but \u201ca great man, too.\u201d \u201c[He] has great integrity,\u201d Brady told CNN, standing alongside Djokovic. \u201cI think what you\u2019ve seen over all these years, the competition always, in my view, brings out the best in people and it certainly has brought out the best in him.\u201d Despite turning 37 later this year, Djokovic said he has no plans of slowing down and is not close to contemplating retirement. The focus, he said, is very much on the next tournament, rather than looking back on his achievements. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s so important to always remind yourself to be in the present moment, really to appreciate, to acknowledge, to remember where you came from, the journey, the path, also the people that surround you,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cEvery single week there\u2019s something new happening and new events. So I think I will truly be able to appreciate everything that we have accomplished really, only post-career, to be honest. \u201cBecause while you\u2019re still active \u2026 it\u2019s what\u2019s the next task? What\u2019s the next challenge? \u201cYou have only maybe a few days or a week max where you\u2019re contemplating on a great success.\u201d If Djokovic needs any tips on preparing for retirement then Brady could be the man to turn to. The former quarterback initially retired in 2022 but came back to play one season before eventually stepping away last year. \u201cI was very happy with the way things ended for me and now I get to sit back and watch him [Djokovic] and I got to go to the El Cl\u00e1sico last night,\u201d Brady said. \u201cYou will always love the competition, that will never go away. You\u2019ll always love the sport, but I think there\u2019s also different ways you can contribute as you go through life.\u201d Speaking about how elite athletes manage to adapt to retirement, Brady added: \u201cWe rarely look back. We always want to look forward because we\u2019re ambitious people. \u201cI think to be in this situation that we\u2019ve been fortunate to be in, it takes a lot of ambition and it\u2019s not like a switch you just turn off. \u201cSo you just keep going as long as you can, and you try to make the best of every opportunity you get.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/23/sport/novak-djokovic-record-grand-slam-laureus-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_06_sport_bayer-leverkusen-equals-record-unbeaten-spt-intl", "text": "German team Bayer Leverkusen extended its miraculous unbeaten run to 48 games on Sunday after thrashing Eintracht Frankfurt 5-1 in the Bundesliga. Unlike many matches this season, Leverkusen never trailed and had five different scorers \u2013 Granit Xhaka, Patrik Schick, Exequiel Palacios, Jeremie Frimpong and Victor Okoh Boniface \u2013 in the blowout victory at Frankfurt\u2019s Deutsche Bank Park. The win means that Leverkusen has now equaled the record for the longest unbeaten run across all top-level matches since the introduction of European competition, according to UEFA. The club shares the mark with Portuguese giant Benfica, which set the record between 1963-65. Leverkusen will have the chance to break the record on Thursday when it plays Roma in the second leg of its Europa League semifinal. The all-time mark of 62 games unbeaten was set by Scottish club Celtic from 1915-1917, however, those matches were all in the domestic league. \u201cOur level, our consistency throughout the season is great. But we are always moving forward. We are always concentrating on the work and improving,\u201d Leverkusen manager Xabi Alonso told reporters after Sunday\u2019s match. Something special has happened at Bayer Leverkusen this season. Die Schwarzroten have already wrapped up the Bundesliga title \u2013 the first in the club\u2019s 119-year history, ending Bayern Munich\u2019s 11-year dominance in the process \u2013 reached the German Cup final and hold a 2-0 advantage going into their Europa League semifinal second leg. Doing all that without losing a single game has been one of the standout stories in world soccer this season. Credit goes to manager Alonso for instilling a never-say-die attitude into his players \u2013 the squad has become renowned for its propensity to pull late goals out when the odds seem stacked against it. But the former Spain international is not content with his team\u2019s achievements to date and wants to continue the incredible run until the end of the season. Leverkusen still has two league games against ninth-ranked Augsburg and 14th-ranked VfL Bochum, the German Cup final against second division FC Kaiserslautern, the semifinal second leg against Roma and a potential Europa League final to come. \u201cIt will be the perfect run. We will certainly try,\u201d Alonso said. \u201cWe still have games to play to achieve our big goals in all competitions. The next game is important for us, the second leg of the Europa League semifinal: a chance to reach the final. \u201cIn football, it\u2019s sometimes difficult to stop. You have to prepare for the next game. And the next game is a big game for us. Hopefully, we have the chance to be in a European final again.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/06/sport/bayer-leverkusen-equals-record-unbeaten-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_sport_2024-wnba-season-preview-spt-intl", "text": "Never before has there been such anticipation ahead of a WNBA season. With the established talent already in situ and an exciting crop of players arriving from the college scene, it promises to be an intriguing time. Here\u2019s everything you need to know ahead of the 2024 campaign. How to watch The season begins on Tuesday with the Washington Mystics and the New York Liberty raising the curtain at the Entertainment and Sports Arena in Washington, DC, at 7 p.m. ET. It\u2019ll be a busy opening day of action, with four games on the slate \u2013 including Caitlin Clark\u2019s Indiana Fever debut at 7:30 p.m. ET. The opening game between the Mystics and the Liberty will be available to watch on ESPN3 and the WNBA\u2019s League Pass platform. The League Pass will show games throughout the season. ESPN, Amazon Prime, ION, NBA TV, ABC, CBS Sports Network and CBS/Paramount+ will broadcast games across the year. Rising to the top? All eyes this season will be on the Fever after they selected Clark with the No. 1 pick in April\u2019s 2024 WNBA draft. Clark arrives in the WNBA with fanfare after enjoying a historic NCAA season with the Iowa Hawkeyes and announcing herself on a wider stage with high-profile sponsorship deals. She is at the forefront of a new wave of interest in women\u2019s basketball; ticket prices to watch the Fever more than doubled even before the draft and TickPick told CNN back in March that 83% of total tickets sold for the Fever\u2019s upcoming season came after her announcement declaring for the draft. Her two preseason games for her new team have been sellouts, too. Clark\u2019s No. 22 Fever jerseys sold out within hours of going on sale, breaking the record for draft pick sales on draft night for any player in any sport, a Fanatics spokesperson told CNN; that record was subsequently broken days later by Caleb Williams after he was drafted by the Chicago Bears in the 2024 NFL Draft. But now Clark will lace up her shoes for her WNBA debut when she and her Indiana teammates travel to Connecticut to face the Sun. Her debut will be another sellout after the Sun announced on Monday that all 8,910 tickets at Mohegan Sun Arena had been snapped up. The Sun last sold out the venue more than 20 years ago in 2003. \u201cThis is what you\u2019ve kind of worked for and dreamed of, and now you get to put your jersey on for the first real time and go out there and play, so I think more than anything, just soak in the moment,\u201d Clark told reporters ahead of her debut. \u201cWe get to play on the biggest stage, there\u2019s going to be a lot of people there, it\u2019s going to be loud, but you only play your first WNBA game once.\u201d The Fever had a disappointing 2023 campaign, missing the postseason and winning 13 games all season. There were reasons for optimism, though, in particular through the play of 2023 Rookie of the Year, Aliyah Boston. The 22-year-old center had 14.5 points, 8.4 rebounds and 1.3 blocks in her debut campaign. But now, paired with Clark at point guard, they could make for a terrifying combination for opposing defenses. The Fever have not played in the playoffs since 2016 and the dominant years the franchise had under former head coach Lin Dunn \u2013 during which time they won one title \u2013 seem a long way away. But with the pairing of the two budding potential stars in Clark and Boston, Indiana could be looking at a much more promising season in 2024. New additions There are plenty of fresh faces to be excited about heading into this new season. The Los Angeles Sparks \u2013 who missed out on the playoffs last year \u2013 have had an intriguing injection of college talent in the forms of Cameron Brink and Rickea Jackson, who were drafted with the second and fourth picks of the draft respectively. For a team which historically was one of the WNBA\u2019s postseason regulars, the Sparks have missed out on the playoffs in the last three seasons but the addition of Brink and Jackson could give Los Angeles the defensive rigidity to blossom into a contender once again. Another team which has two potentially game-changing draft pick additions is the Chicago Sky. The Sky selected Kamilla Cardoso and Angel Reese with the third and seventh picks respectively in this year\u2019s draft. Both bring defensive and offensive traits to Illinois, playing starring roles in their respective college teams\u2019 title-winning runs in the last two years. Reese helped LSU to the NCAA women\u2019s basketball title in 2023, while Cardoso did the same this year for South Carolina. Often it\u2019s tough for rookies to make a meaningful impact in their first year in the professional league, but many members of the 2024 class are predicted to excel and help their new outfits in the wins column. Can anyone stop the Aces? The Las Vegas Aces have become the team to beat in the last two seasons. The Aces have won back-to-back WNBA titles and possess a star-studded roster, headlined by two-time WNBA MVP A\u2019ja Wilson, Kelsey Plum and last year\u2019s Sixth Player of the Year Alysha Clark. The team\u2019s roster was depleted by the retirement of Candance Parker last month, but the two-time WNBA MVP missed the majority of Las Vegas\u2019 title run last season with a foot injury, a sign the team can function in her absence. The question now moves to who can stop the Aces from winning three titles in a row? The New York Liberty, the team which lost to Las Vegas in the WNBA Finals last year, look best placed to do so with their collection of superstar talent; Sabrina Ionescu, Breanna Stewart, Courtney Vandersloot and Jonquel Jones all ply their trade in the Barclays Center. The Liberty have a poor record in the WNBA playoffs so far, however, having never won a title and lost in the Finals five times. But with head coach Sandy Brondello heading into her third year in the job, New York could be best placed to once again challenge Las Vegas for the title. Elsewhere, the Connecticut Sun have title aspirations after losing in the semifinals of last season\u2019s playoffs. Their roster is led by Alyssa Thomas and DeWanna Bonner, with the team drafting Leila Lacan out of Angers in France with the 10th pick in this year\u2019s draft.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/sport/2024-wnba-season-preview-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2022_07_25_sport_black-representation-swimming-equality-spt-intl", "text": "Omie Dale has fond memories of splashing in the sea as a child, of racing through water parks and swimming in backwaters and rivers.   \u201cThere\u2019s so much joy that can be had once you learn to swim, once you\u2019ve abandoned those fears and you can get in the water,\u201d the 25-year-old Dale, who is based in southeast London, tells CNN Sport.  Even though swimming is a joyful experience for Dale, the stark reality is that many Black communities in Britain and the US do not have safe access to swimming lessons and public pools due to historic racism and segregation \u2013 a problem that is especially alarming given that, as Dale says, it is \u201cthe only sport that can save your life.\u201d  A history of exclusion The lack of access afforded to Black communities in Britain is what motivated Dale to become a swimming teacher in September 2019.  \u201cI used to work in Kensington (in London) as a lifeguard and some of the richest people live in that borough, but also some of the poorest,\u201d she says. She saw there was a difference when private schools and independent schools would come in and all the kids were able to swim, yet hardly any children of the same age that Dale saw from state schools could swim 25 meters.  \u201cThere\u2019s a real class barrier in the sport of swimming,\u201d Dale adds.   She is a director of Swimunity, a collective offering free swimming lessons to women and children in North Kensington, West London. It was born in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster in 2017, when a residential block caught on fire, killing 72 people \u2013 and leaving many more without homes.   \u201cThere\u2019s like a lot of people who come to swim lessons \u2026 who have undergone some form of trauma, whether that be water-related trauma or trauma related to their everyday lives,\u201d Dale says.   \u201cMany people say it\u2019s like an escape from their daily lives or is, actually, the first time that they\u2019ve taken time for themselves.\u201d  While 77% of children from the most affluent families in England can swim 25 meters unaided, only 34% from the least affluent families can, according to a 2021 survey from Sport England, a non-departmental public body that fosters grassroots sports in England.  About 95% of Black adults and 80% of Black children in England do not regularly participate in swimming, according to Sport England\u2019s report, published in January 2020. Likewise, about 93% of Asian adults and 78% of Asian children, including those with Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi heritage, do not regularly participate in swimming, the same research found. This trend extends to the US, where nearly 64% of Black children have \u201clow\u201d or no ability to swim, compared with 40% of their White peers, according to 2017 data from the country\u2019s national governing body for the sport at a competitive level, USA Swimming.   The underrepresentation of Black people in the pool in the US can be traced back to the early 20th century.   Public swimming pools became popular in North America in the 1920s and 30s and were initially open to all. However, Northern politicians stipulated a \u201cWhites Only\u201d rule, referencing racist fears about Black men fraternizing with White women.   Even after legal racial segregation ended in the US in 1964, public pools continued to be hostile environments. As people of color began to use public pools, White swimmers retreated to the privacy of their own pools and private clubs, where expensive fees continue to be an economic barrier for Black families who cannot afford the cost.    Similar examples in Britain illustrate how racial and class inequalities lead to the systemic exclusion of Black people in pools. For example, more than 4.2 million people in the UK live in ethnically diverse communities where Covid-19 national lockdowns resulted in the closure or mothballing of pools, according to Swim England \u2013 England\u2019s national swimming governing body \u2013 and the Black Swimming Association (BSA), a UK-based charity that aims to encourage more African, Caribbean and Asian communities to take up swimming.  \u2018We cannot keep recovering bodies\u2019  Globally, drowning is the third leading cause of accidental injury-related death and at least 236,000 people die each year from drowning, according to 2019 data from the World Health Organization (WHO). Children are particularly affected, with drowning being one of the top five causes of death for those aged 1-14 years in 48 of 85 countries studied by the WHO.   And while natural disasters and irregular migration are notorious risk factors, so are lower socioeconomic status, lack of higher education and being a member of an ethnic minority, depending on the country, WHO research shows.  \u201cMost drowning incidents happen when people never intend to get into the water in the first place,\u201d says Dale, who was awarded Swim Teacher of the Year by Swim England in 2021.  In December 2019, three members of the same Black British family \u2013 a 53-year-old father and his two children \u2013 died in a swimming pool at a resort in Costa del Sol, Spain, Reuters reported. The father and his 16-year-old son had reportedly leapt into the water to try to save his nine-year-old daughter, who was drowning.   Danielle Obe is the co-founder and chair of the BSA. She told CNN Sport that the Costa del Sol deaths prompted her to establish the BSA in March 2020, alongside Olympic swimmer Alice Dearing, journalist Seren Jones and songwriter, rapper and producer Ed Accura.    \u201cThis was devastating because these families were actually acquainted to me and they were from my local community,\u201d Obe says. \u201c(At) that point, I called Alice and Seren, and I said, \u2018We\u2019ve been talking about doing something for our community. We\u2019ve got to do something. We\u2019ve got to do it now. We cannot keep recovering bodies.\u2019\u201d   \u201cIt\u2019s no longer just about that lack of representation,\u201d Obe adds.   \u201cIt\u2019s now about saving lives, vital water safety, education for all. Swimming is an intervention. Swimming is a life skill.\u201d  However, there is still a lack of data when it comes to drowning-related deaths by ethnicity in the UK, says Obe.  \u201cAt the moment, we don\u2019t know how much of a disparity there is between drowning and fatalities, aquatic fatalities for different communities in the UK because, up until now, drowning data isn\u2019t really captured by ethnicity, which is another point, another issue that the BSA is looking to tackle.\u201d \u2018People just don\u2019t think Black people should swim\u2019  Dearing, the first Black female swimmer to represent Britain at the Olympics when she competed at Tokyo 2020, \u201cimplores\u201d people to learn to swim.   \u201cI have been quite torn between the amazing achievement of being the first Black woman to represent GB in swimming but wanting to be my own person, my own athlete, who\u2019s known for being an athlete and not for her race and her sport combined together,\u201d she tells CNN Sport. \u201cI take the two of them just as they are \u2013 kind of like separate things. I\u2019m trying to be the best athlete and best role model that I can be to show people that they can do the sport, that the sport is for everybody.\u201d At the age of 24, Dearing was making history in Japan and became a beacon of hope for young people \u2013 especially Black girls \u2013 who wanted to break into the sport.   But her personal triumph also drew attention to the institutional access gap for people of color in swimming.    \u201cFortunately, for myself, I haven\u2019t come across any barriers at the level I\u2019m at currently,\u201d Dearing says.   \u201cBut I have faced barriers when I was younger and issues where people just don\u2019t think Black people should swim, or do swim, or think that we\u2019re better suited to other sports and so shouldn\u2019t even learn to swim or attempt swimming in the first place.\u201d  CNN reached out to the International Swimming Federation (FINA), Sport England and USA Swimming requesting a breakdown of Black and ethnic minority participation in swimming at grassroots and professional levels of the sport. However, they told CNN they were unable to provide such data.  FINA \u2013 the global governing body for swimming \u2013 told CNN it does not have a breakdown of the ethnicities of swimmers at a grassroots or elite level.   FINA said in 2021 it allocated $6.6 million towards development programs for distribution among all national federations and continental associations, while also pushing for diversity in the sport through its \u201cSwimming for All, Swimming for Life\u201d program.   \u201cFINA remains fully committed to non-discrimination,\u201d the organization said to CNN in a statement. \u201cFINA continues to work hard to ensure that the global aquatics community is a place where all athletes, coaches and administrators are treated equally. \u201cWork will continue to develop and grow with the support of members of the aquatics community as we strive to be at the forefront of this essential area,\u201d FINA added.    Sport England told CNN in a statement that it is \u201ccommitted to increasing investment in facilities and organisations across England to try to level up access to good quality sports and activities.\u201d \u201cBarriers to getting active persist and have even been exacerbated for some disadvantaged groups \u2013 like women, people with long-term health conditions, disabled people, people from ethnically diverse communities and lower socio-economic groups,\u201d the statement added.   Sport England said in May it announced further funding that brings its total investment in its 121 partners to more than \u00a3550 million ($670 million), which they\u2019ve selected \u201cdue to their unique position to tackle entrenched activity inequalities and influence positive change throughout the sector, their own networks and beyond.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s not all about the economic side of things. It is also about getting people to feel comfortable with putting their kids in swim lessons and in competitive swimming so that they can then go and do other aquatic-based sports,\u201d Joel Shinofield, the managing director of sport development at USA Swimming, told CNN during a phone call.  USA Swimming is a membership-serviced organization that has over 3,100 clubs and more than 400,000 members, according to the official website.   \u201cOur goal is to facilitate opportunities and make sure they\u2019re good ones. While our clubs are the ones that do that on the local level, the resources, guidance, support, financial investment that we provide can shift who those opportunities can be provided to and more broadly create access,\u201d he added.   Shinofield said that USA Swimming has established a 10-year initiative that will grant $1 million to develop learn-to-swim and competitive opportunities for communities served by Historical Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The program was announced in 2021, according to the USA Swimming official website.   Serving underrepresented communities  From representing their organization at the UK\u2019s first Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Summit For Sport in Birmingham, England earlier this year to facilitating swimming classes in Hackney \u2013 one of the most deprived boroughs in London \u2013 Obe hopes that the BSA will help bridge the barrier through community-level engagement.   \u201cThat community engagement really is to build trust, accountability and collaboration with disenfranchised communities and the sector,\u201d says Obe.  \u201cOnly in understanding these attitudes and understanding some of the barriers that preclude our communities from engaging in aquatics can we begin to drive change.\u201d  In August 2021, the BSA announced it would conduct a research program with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the University of Portsmouth, exploring the behaviors and barriers that prevent African, Caribbean and Asian communities from swimming.    Speaking about the program, Obe says: \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to inspire confidence with African, Caribbean and Asian communities, and the only way we\u2019re able to do that is to ensure that we understand where these communities are in the first place and understand why they don\u2019t engage in aquatics, why we don\u2019t see the representation pool side and why we don\u2019t even see the representation within some aquatic organizations.\u201d  Dale also volunteers with Mental Health Swims, a grassroots organization that facilitates swimming meet-ups for people struggling with their mental health. As part of her work for the organization, she coordinates swim events in south London to help swimmers access the mental health benefits of the sport. She also volunteers for Pride in Water, a network that aims to increase LGBTQ+ representation in swimming.   \u2018The future is bright\u2019  Dearing says that despite the racial and economic barriers to swimming for African, Caribbean and Asian communities, she\u2019s still optimistic about the changing landscape of the sport.  \u201cI really think if anything is going to change, it\u2019s going to be now, it\u2019s going to be over the next couple of years,\u201d she says. \u201cEach story is different, each person is different and has to be understood in their own way, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, that\u2019s just another challenge that we have to face and we\u2019re up for it.  \u201cIt\u2019s tough \u2013 it\u2019s not a quick fix, but the future is bright.  \u201cI like to feel that I\u2019m giving something back to swimming and, hopefully, giving something to the Black community to hopefully achieve, strive for and change the way that Black people are viewed in swimming and the way Black people view swimming.  \u201cIt\u2019s a double-edged sword; I absolutely love doing it. Sometimes, it\u2019s really frightening and daunting, but if I\u2019m trying to make the world a better place, then sometimes you got to step out and scare yourself.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/07/25/sport/black-representation-swimming-equality-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "sports"}}

The 22-time grand slam singles champion is looking to rediscover his form after a spate of injury problems have hampered his progress so far this year. Before the tournament, Nadal said that he was determined to play in Madrid \u2013 where he is a record five-time champion \u2013 one final time, despite doubts about whether he was physically ready to compete at a high level. However, he won his first three matches before losing to Lehe\u010dka in the fourth round, showing no obvious signs that his body was holding him back. \u201cToday is an emotional day, of course, today is an unforgettable day in terms of saying goodbye to Madrid,\u201d Nadal told reporters. \u201cBut it\u2019s one of the places \u2013 or even probably the place \u2013 where I\u2019ve received more love and support during all these years. \u201cMy career keeps going and I have my personal goals for the next couple of weeks.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s match saw a close opening set until Lehe\u010dka broke Nadal to love at 5-5 and then breezed through his own service game to take the first set, silencing the home crowd. The world No. 31 claimed another break in the opening game of the second set and, though Nadal battled hard to stay in touch, was able to see out the victory from there in just over two hours. Lehe\u010dka will now face Russian third seed Daniil Medvedev in the quarterfinals on Thursday. The tournament paid tribute to Nadal\u2019s five titles at the Madrid Open after the match, unfurling banners with photos of his victories in 2005, 2010, 2013, 2014 and 2017. While his family members shed tears in the players\u2019 box, Nadal thanked fans for their support, which he said would \u201cstay with me forever.\u201d The Spaniard later told reporters that he now plans to play at the Italian Open in Rome as he continues to target more grand slam success at the French Open, which begins on May 26. \u201cIt has been a very positive week, winning three matches, playing four matches at a high level of tennis,\u201d said Nadal. \u201cI enjoy it a lot playing at home and I leave here with a very positive energy in all ways.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/01/sport/rafael-nadal-madrid-open-jiri-lehecka-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "sports"}}
