For the first time in 12 years, Ukraine will be represented in all\u00a0the\u00a0synchronized disciplines of high dive and the 3-meter\u00a0springboard, for both men and women. \u201cWe live under constant pressure,\u201d said Psymenska, who will be competing at her third Olympics. \u201cDuring the day, we spend all our energy preparing for the Games. But at night, we wake up either from explosions or from the sound of sirens. It\u2019s a lot of stress.\u201d Anna was born in central Ukraine but later moved to live and train in the eastern city of Luhansk. She left in 2014 when Russian forces occupied that territory. \u201cI didn\u2019t even bring my things with me. I never thought I\u2019d ever come back there again,\u201d said the diver. Psymenska says she has a recurring dream ever since fleeing: going back to Luhansk, but Russians\u00a0won\u2019t let her leave town. She then moved her training to Kyiv until February 2022, when Russia again tried to invade the city where she lived. Following the start of the war, Psymenska moved to Croatia with her team before returning to Kyiv in the summer of 2022. But constant Russian attacks make preparation and concentration challenging. \u201cWe train every day.\u00a0Physically, we are ready. But morally, it\u2019s quite difficult. I was hysterical a few days ago. Because of the constant blackouts, I eat incomprehensibly. You can\u2019t plan anything. The lights are never on. It\u2019s the Stone Age. It\u2019s very unnerving,\u201d said Psymenska. Blackouts and sirens As Russia continues to\u00a0strike Ukraine\u2019s\u00a0energy facilities across the country, blackouts have become longer. The Ukrainian Diving Federation had to buy a powerful generator for the swimming pool where the divers train to deal with constant power outages. If an air raid siren sounds during practice, the athletes immediately stop and go down to the bomb shelter. \u201cDiving is a difficult sport,\u201d Ilya Tselutin, the national team coach, said to CNN. \u201cBefore jumping, you have to prepare and warm up.\u00a0Coming back after,\u00a0athletes have to prepare again from scratch before jumping.\u201d There are set to be 136 divers from around the world who will participate at the 2024 Olympic Games in France. A panel of judges\u00a0will\u00a0score each dive based on various criteria, including how aesthetically pleasing a diver\u2019s movements are, the complexity of the dive and how well they enter the water. Synchronized diving is also scored on how well the two divers match each other\u2019s movements. But for Tselutin, these Games are more than just about the sport of diving. \u201cThe task of the divers is to win top-level medals and to raise the Ukrainian flag as high as possible. This is their front right now. To show that our country is very strong, that the nation is invincible,\u201d\u00a0he said. A debut in Paris The Paris Games will be 21-year-old Danylo Konovalov\u2019s first Olympics. Each day he begins at 7 a.m. and has two training sessions. If there are air raid sirens, he tries to do some physical exercises as he waits in the basement. Konovalov was born in the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv, but because of the invasion, he couldn\u2019t train in his hometown. In April 2022, the Russians blew up a water pipeline, leaving the city without drinking water. As a result, Konovalov first moved away from Ukraine, though he soon returned to train in Kyiv. His parents still live in Mykolaiv, a city that Russian forces constantly hit. \u201cI\u2019m not reading the news.\u00a0I feel much calmer this way. My mom calls me and tells me how things are so that I can concentrate on a sport,\u201d Konovalov said to CNN. On July 5, the diving team had a farewell ceremony in Kyiv. It began with a priest\u2019s blessing at a church near the pool where the athletes train. Konovalov admits that he has a few superstitions that he religiously observes. \u201cI have my lucky swimwear in which I jump well. It\u2019s also important to find the right place for your slippers.\u00a0If the jump goes well, I only put my slippers in the same place,\u201d he said. If he wins a medal, Konovalov says he will dedicate his success to Ukraine and its soldiers. Despite everything that is happening in his country, Konovalov says he will try to do his best and stay focused on the Olympic Games \u2013 this is his battle for Ukraine.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/sport/ukrainian-athletes-olympics-preparation-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "sports"}}

The New York Liberty\u2019s Courtney Vandersloot held the previous record of 18 assists, set in August 2020 when she was with the Chicago Sky.

{"id": "2024_07_14_sport_lamine-yamal-lionel-messi-photoshoot-2007-spt-intl", "text": "Joan Monfort\u2019s world has turned upside down. The Barcelona-based photographer has been a regular at sporting events around Spain for over 30 years, but a photoshoot he did back in 2007 has recently resurfaced, turning him into a global superstar. Monfort was the photographer who captured a then-20-year-old Lionel Messi holding a baby as part of a photoshoot for UNICEF and Barcelona, with the Argentine soccer star also posing with the inflant in the bath alongside his mother. As it turns out, greatness was holding soon to be greatness. The baby in question is Barcelona and Spain\u2019s teenager sensation Lamine Yamal, who turned 17 on July 13. Yamal has been the breakout performer at Euro 2024, with his stunning recordbreaking goal in the semifinal against France cementing his place as world football\u2019s most exciting talent. \u201cI\u2019m just living in a dream,\u201d Monfort tells CNN\u2019s Don Riddell as the photographer reflected on the rollercoaster of emotions he\u2019s experienced over the last few days. \u2018The beginning of two legends\u2019 The photos of Messi holding Yamal grabbed the world\u2019s attention when his dad posted a picture on his Instagram account of the baby\u2019s mum and the Argentine smiling at the infant in a soapy bath with the caption: \u201cThe beginning of two legends.\u201d Then early in July, Monfort received a phone call out of the blue. \u201cOne colleague at the newspaper, SPORT, called me at 12 o\u2019clock in the night and said to me: \u2018Is this your picture?\u2019\u201d says Monfort. \u201cAnd I answered: \u2018Yes, this is my picture. I [took] this picture years ago.\u2019 And I asked: \u2018Who is the baby?\u2019 And he [told] me the baby is Lionel Messi, of course. And the other baby is Lamine Yamal.\u201d Before the call, Monfort admits that he had forgotten about the photo and that he didn\u2019t know who the baby was who had photographed with Messi, explaining that the photoshoot came as part of a fundraising and awareness project between Bar\u00e7a and UNICEF. The club and UNICEF ran the project each year, producing a calendar of the team\u2019s stars with locals from different backgrounds. A few years prior, the photoshoot had involved Barcelona and Brazil superstar Ronaldinho posing for pictures with Monfort\u2019s daughter, Jana. Yamal was raised in the neighborhood of Rocafonda in Matar\u00f3, a city close to Barcelona. Nowadays, his celebration after scoring involves using his fingers to make the numbers three, zero and four in front of his chest \u2013 it\u2019s a reference to the last three numbers which constitute the 08304 postcode of hte Rocafonda neighborhood. Monfort says that Yamal\u2019s family won a raffle to be participants in the photoshoot, while Jana says that they were appropriate applications because of the families \u201ceconomic problems.\u201d During the photoshoot, Monfort remembers Messi being \u201cvery shy\u201d but \u201cvery professional\u201d while he took the snaps with Yamal. Jana, who says she was five at the time of the shoot, recalls the rubber duck which appears in some of the photos. This duck just so happened to be a regular part in her bath routines at home for years but unfortunately, has since been lost. After the photoshoot, memory of the photo fell into the deep recesses of his mind as he focused on other work \u2013 he was a regular at many of Barcelona\u2019s successes with Messi on the pitch, while he also covered the the Olympics, Formula One and MotoGP. Even when he captured a then 15-year-old Yamal becoming the youngest player in over a century to make his Barcelona debut last year or when he was watching the teenager dazzle in his early performances at Euro 2024, Monfort had no idea he\u2019d already snapped photos of the Spain international when he was a baby. It was only in the hours after the then-16-year-old Yamal had provided an assist and played a vital role in Spain\u2019s quarterfinal victory over tournament host Germany that Monfort was told of his prior meeting with Yamal. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of crazy. I\u2019ve never thought that my dad would do something like this,\u201d Jana told CNN. \u201cI mean, I love his work but I just wasn\u2019t, I wasn\u2019t prepared for this. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s been crazy. \u201cHe\u2019s very discrete. He\u2019s actually not enjoying it. Well, maybe for a few days. But afterwards he\u2019s just like, not that kind of person.\u201d Monfort says he is \u201cproud\u201d of the photo, as he reflected \u201cone in a billion\u201d moment. Both Messi and Yamal came through Barcelona\u2019s famed La Masia academy and made their debuts at young ages, though the Argentina was 18 when he made his international debut. Messi is Bar\u00e7a\u2019s record goalscorer with 672 goals. He\u2019s also played the most games, won the most trophies, and secured the most Bal\u00f3n d\u2019Or awards in the club\u2019s history.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/sport/lamine-yamal-lionel-messi-photoshoot-2007-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_07_18_sport_adnan-khankan-muhammad-ali-judo-2024-paris-olympics-spt-intl", "text": "It\u2019s almost 60 years since boxing icon Muhammad Ali defied his draft order to join the US military in opposition to his government\u2019s involvement in the Vietnam War. \u201cWhy should me, and so-called other negroes, go 10,000 miles away from home here in America to drop bombs and bullets on other innocent Brown people?\u201d said Ali. Stripped of his titles and sentenced to five years in prison in 1967, Ali was also\u00a0banned from boxing for three years. But he was also\u00a0seen as a voice for the anti-war movement \u2013 a leading figure in the US willing to stand up for what he believed in. Decades later, Ali\u2019s influence and actions continue to resonate. \u201cHe was someone who stood up and said \u2018no.\u2019 To have that sort of strength was something that inspired me,\u201d says Adnan Khankan ahead of his Olympic judo debut in Paris later this month. Ali was also an Olympian, winning a\u00a0gold medal in 1960. Khankan will compete under the flag of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as one of the 37 members of the sporting body\u2019s Refugee Team, who will take part across 12 sports. The 30-year-old Khankan now calls Cologne in Germany his home. Originally from Damascus, the capital city of Syria, he was forced to flee his homeland back in 2015 following his conscription into Bashar al-Assad\u2019s army as the nation\u2019s brutal civil war spiralled further out of control. Inspired by the actions of Ali, describing him as a \u201cgreat man,\u201d Khankan was steadfast in his rejection of any involvement\u00a0in the civil war which\u00a0claimed the lives of over 300,000 civilians. The conflict is ongoing. Conscription into the Syrian Army \u201cI didn\u2019t see it as my war, how could it be when it was Syrian people killing other Syrian people? It made no sense to me and I said that this was not my fight,\u201d Khankan tells CNN Sport, recalling the day that army recruiters knocked on the door of his family home. \u201cI thought to myself, why should I have to go and kill my fellow people? War to me is a meaningless thing, so I knew that I would do anything not to become a part of it. The Syrian Civil War, which initially broke out in 2011, is now considered the biggest humanitarian crisis since World War II.\u00a0Millions remain displaced. Initially, protestors who were inspired by the region-wide \u2018Arab Spring\u2019 movement, demanded that the government, which has been led by Bashar Al-Assad since 2000, enact legislative reforms and release political prisoners. However, these calls for change were brutally quashed by Al-Assad\u2019s Syrian Army, acting as the genesis for the creation of the Free Syrian Army and thus sparking what is now one the most protracted conflicts of the 21st\u00a0century. \u201cWhen you live in a country like Syria, you don\u2019t have the freedom to really say no. Whatever the government says, you have to do. You don\u2019t have any other choices,\u201d Khankan says. The death of one of Khankan\u2019s closest friends two years into the hostilities was the moment that irrevocably altered his perspective as to what was happening in Syria. When the war began, he says he was sheltered from the realities of the conflict by his family. That all changed in 2013. \u201cI was training at the national sports complex and the morning started like any other,\u201d recalls Khankan. \u201cI sat down for breakfast with one of my closest friends, an athlete on the national taekwondo team. \u201cWe then both went our separate ways to training in different parts of the complex. But two hours later, I heard a huge bang and realized that there had been an explosion. Everyone was scared and trying to find out what had happened. It was chaos.\u201d After discovering that the blast had killed his friend, Khankan came to the realization that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t take my life for granted. The same thing could just as easily happen to me at any moment.\u201d A fraught journey to safety As Khankan had\u00a0been\u00a0representing his country at international level in judo competitions, he was able to negotiate a six-month postponement to his conscription\u2019s start date. And following the death of his friend, Khankan made the decision to flee. Setting off in the autumn of 2015, at just 21 years of age, he began a month-long journey northwards in search of the sanctity of Europe, travelling by foot, car, truck, bus and train. After crossing the border into Turkey, Khankan then followed a common refugee route known as the \u201cBalkan Way,\u201d which saw him pass through Bulgaria, Serbia, Bosnia and Croatia, before ultimately ending up getting arrested at the Hungarian border due to his lack of identification and visa documents. \u201cMy life changed in just the space of a few weeks. I had gone from having everything, to having less than nothing. I found myself in a foreign land, with no way to communicate and no way of getting help,\u201d Khankan recalls. After spending three nights in detention, Khankan was told that he could either be sent back to Syria or spend six months confined to a refugee camp whilst his processing was completed. So Khankan embarked on a six-month period of confinement in a German refugee camp.\u00a0The judoka says his family fled to Cairo a few months after he left Syria. The end of the Olympic dream Khankan was unable to train as a judoka, or even jog and keep fit in the camp. By the time he was released in early 2016, the Rio Olympics was just a matter of months away. He was sitting on a sofa as he watched the opening ceremony unfold before the world\u2019s eyes at the\u00a0Maracan\u00e3 Stadium. \u201cI had made it to safety, but all I could think about in that moment was missing out on my dream,\u201d says Khankan. \u201cWhen you train for something every day for 20 years, the moment you recognize it won\u2019t arrive is a lot for someone to deal with. I forced myself to watch every day of the Games, even though I cried every single time.\u201d Khankan was buoyed by the achievement of fellow Syrian Yusra Mardini, who competed for the IOC refugee team at Rio, and vowed that he would do everything within his power to make the team for Tokyo 2020. \u201cIt really motivated me when I found out about the existence of a refugee team,\u201d said Khankan. \u201cI spent\u00a0everyday\u00a0training, sometimes two or three times a day, with the goal of making it to the next Games.\u201d Even without\u00a0any support from a governing body, Khankan began to climb the ranks and the prospect of qualifying for Japan became a real possibility. Then in early 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic swept across Europe. Germany strictly observed its Covid protocols, resulting in Adnan\u2019s inability to travel to compete, thereby ending his hopes of an Olympic debut. Misconceptions around refugees After years of trying to obtain funding for training, a chance email to International Judo Federaton (IJF) President Marius Vizer led to Adnan finally securing the support he needed to help achieve his Olympic dream. \u201cAdnan is a very hard-working and passionate judoka, with a big heart,\u201d IJF President Vizer told CNN Sport. \u201cWorking with refugees and supporting refugee athletes is a core mission for the International Judo Federation. As I once was a refugee myself, I understand their struggles and their difficult situations. Sports is not only a tool for peace, it is also a tool for betterment of the individual and their life.\u201d Khankan is acutely aware of the stigma that faces many refugees. At a time when record numbers of people are being displaced due to ongoing conflicts in places such as Ukraine, Gaza and Sudan against the backdrop of European elections which saw a surge in support for anti-migrant right-wing candidates, Khankan is hoping to highlight the fact that refugees are \u201cjust normal people like everyone else. Last year, over 114 million people were displaced, a record according to UNHCR. \u201cIn the media now, across Europe and even here in Germany, we are told refugees are dangerous, that we shouldn\u2019t be approached, that we are not good people,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen one refugee does something bad, it seems like people want to say that every refugee is bad. They don\u2019t do that the other way around for other people which I think is really unfair. With sport, we can try to change this image and perception and the Olympic Games can be a great platform to try and spread this message. \u201cWhen people flee other countries and become refugees, they can end up in camps in the Middle East or Africa. Refugees in these other places are starving or have no clothes. There is no hope for them. My hope is that they can see that through sport and the IOC\u2019s refugee program, there are opportunities to change their situation and offer them a better life.\u201d The very concept of the Olympic Refugee Team should be enough to quell the voices of those who spread anti-refugee sentiment, Khankan adds. \u201cThe refugee team speak different languages, are different ethnicities, come from different cultures, but we are all one team competing together. You have people like me from Syria, standing alongside people from Iran, Afghanistan, Cuba etcetera. \u201cAll these difficult situations in the one team. So, I think that this is an extremely important message to put out into the world, that together we are better and we can achieve great things.\u201d Ahead of his Olympic debut, Khankan says that, although he holds aspirations of claiming a medal in the -100kg weight division, the mere fact he will be in Paris competing is reason enough to be grateful. Fulfilling a lifelong aspiration which had seemingly slipped away, he sees everything after the July 26 opening ceremony as a bonus. \u201cThe end result is not the most important,\u201d says Khankan. \u201cThat is a mistake many athletes make. It just adds unnecessary pressure. \u201cFor me, as someone who lost almost everything, to be here now is surreal. I\u2019m about to compete at the Olympics and I\u2019m living in a safe country with opportunities \u2013 I already feel every day like I\u2019ve won a gold medal.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/sport/adnan-khankan-muhammad-ali-judo-2024-paris-olympics-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_sport_saya-sakakibara-bmx-paris-olympics-2024-spt-intl", "text": "BMX rider Saya Sakakibara is all too aware of the risks of her chosen profession. Her brother sustained a traumatic brain injury while racing, and Sakakibara has had two severe concussions, the second of which made her seriously consider quitting. The Australian was leading during one of the semifinals at the Tokyo Games in 2021, when a collision with another racer just before the finish line resulted in a \u201cpretty bad concussion\u201d that prematurely ended her Olympic debut. \u201cI remember waking up and just being in disbelief,\u201d Sakakibara told CNN Sport. A concussion happens after a \u201cbump, blow, or jolt to the head\u201d or \u201ca hit to the body that causes the head and brain to move quickly back and forth,\u201d according to guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Another concussion in June 2022 in the middle of her World Cup campaign pushed Sakakibara towards breaking point. \u201cWhen I was in Switzerland going through rehab, literally, I was like, \u2018What\u2019s the point? I\u2019m going through so much pain right now and BMX has given me a lot of grief,\u2019\u201d said Sakakibara. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s worth the risk of having another concussion.\u201d Despite admitting that fear plays a role while competing, Sakakibara, who is a two-time BMX World Cup winner, said the \u201cfeeling of unfinished business\u201d persuaded her to carry on competing and that she \u201cwouldn\u2019t change anything\u201d about her career. \u201cEverything I did led me to this point,\u201d she added. \u2018All I had to do was just come along for a ride\u2019 Born in Australia in August 1999 to a Japanese mother and a British father, Sakakibara moved to Japan as a child. She recalled riding bikes with her brother, as cycling on pump tracks \u2014 single-line trails \u2014 became part of their daily routine. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a choice because my brother, Kai, was absolutely obsessed with riding bikes,\u201d said Sakakibara. \u201cOur parents were really supportive of that, and they bought me a bike, so I was tagging along every time.\u201d She joined her local BMX club when her family moved back to Australia in 2007 and quickly showed early promise. Alongside multiple national, state championship wins and a sixth-place finish in her World Championships debut, Sakakibara placed second overall at the 2018 World Cup circuit. Kai was also a promising BMX racer \u2013 he was 10th in the world rankings in February 2020, while Sakakibara was in the top five. That same month, while both brother and sister were preparing for the Tokyo Games, the then 23-year-old Kai had to be put in a medically induced coma for two months after he fell during an opening round heat at a World Cup event in New South Wales, Australia. A traumatic brain injury (T\ufeffBI) that he sustained after losing balance and hitting his head into the track\ufeff has impacted his ability to speak and move the right side of his body, and he had to learn key life skills from scratch. For 16 months, medical facilities became part of Kai\u2019s daily pattern\ufeff. Since then, Sakakibara said, he has progressed \u201cso quickly.\u201d Kai is able to walk, and has found his passion for public speaking to raise awareness about TBI and inspire others; a complete turnaround from what brain specialists had predicted four years ago. \u201cHaving [BMX racing] taken away, it was definitely hard for him to go through what he went through [with] the rehab,\u201d said Sakakibara of her brother, who now aspires to represent Australia in rowing at the Los Angeles Paralympic Games in 2028. \u201cI was always following Kai. He just took care of everything and all I had to do was just come along for the ride. I didn\u2019t even think about the threat he had on his life and how much his life is going to change in this moment. \u201cI learned a lot about myself \u2013 there\u2019s so many things outside my control that happens. So many things that are unfair, and we just have to keep going, which is the tough part. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t make sense, sometimes it feels like this is the worst thing that\u2019s going to ever happen to us, but at some point, we actually are going to learn from it.\u201d Heartbreak in Tokyo While on the international circuit without her brother around, Sakakibara had to contend with the realities of a BMX racing career by herself and said she \u201cdidn\u2019t understand what she was doing\u201d while cycling in an arena without Kai\u2019s guidance. The start of the Tokyo Games, Sakakibara said, was \u201ca big mess,\u201d as she finished last in her first race. She quickly bounced back at the end of day one, when she had the third-fastest lap of the quarterfinals. Sakakibara earned enough points to go through to the semifinals, but the Australian then crashed mid-air with current world champion Alise Willoughby just before the finish line. Although fifth and first place finishes in the first two runs were enough for the Australian to make it to the final day, she was not fit to compete as the crash left her badly concussed. \u201cI was leading the lap, but I was struggling a lot with my endurance to keep up to the finish line, so I knew that a lot of girls were catching up and my legs were just blown out by the time I got to the last corner,\u201d she explained. \u201cEveryone was on edge, and it was an unfamiliar experience that it\u2019s all kind of a blur at the moment.\u201d Post-concussion symptoms \u2013 prolonged headaches, fatigue and mood swings \u2013 and a struggle to accept the outcome of the race took a toll on Sakakibara\u2019s mental health and her preparations for what proved to be an unsuccessful 2022 season. \u201cIt was a tough period to come back from,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a lot of hype towards the Olympic Games. There was a lot that happened before with Kai, and there was a lot of emotion and purpose attached to this Olympic campaign that, since it ended in such a disappointing fashion, I didn\u2019t know how to navigate and process properly.\u201d Another concussion almost a year after the crash in Tokyo left Sakakibara unable to enjoy racing. She also worried that another concussion might be too much of a risk, so much so that she told her friends and family that she was done with BMX racing. After deliberating for couple of months, however, she decided to continue. \u201cPhysically I was there, I was fast enough, I was doing quite well, so all I needed to do was focus on my mental side,\u201d Sakakibara said. \u201cI gave it another go and that\u2019s the push that I needed.\u201d \u2018I\u2019ve grown so much as an athlete and as a person\u2019 Subsequently Sakakibara won five out of 10 rounds throughout 2023 to become the World Cup champion for the first time and went back-to-back this year after winning four out of six races in a shorter campaign. She finished eighth at the World Championships in May, though the 24-year-old said she was using that disappointment as motivation with the Olympics just around the corner. Saakibara spends half a year in Paris, which could benefit the Australian coming into the Games. The Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines Velodrome will be open for public use before the Olympics and the Australian joked that she \u201ccould ride every day\u201d if she wanted to. Expectations are high after what Sakakibara called \u201cthe most successful couple of seasons\u201d of her career, but after the Games in 2021, she was more philosophical about competing at Paris. \u201cWhat I deem as a success at the Olympics is just walking away feeling like I did my best,\u201d she said. \u201cI did get wrapped up in all the hype in Tokyo, I was just winging out everywhere, and it was very overwhelming, very exciting. \u201cIt\u2019s only been three years, but I feel like I\u2019ve grown so much as an athlete and as a person. I know that when the pressure is high, when I know what I\u2019m doing, everything will follow, and I will be able to do my best performance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/sport/saya-sakakibara-bmx-paris-olympics-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "sports"}}

The midfielder made history, becoming the youngest player to make his regular-season\u00a0debut among the top North American professional sports leagues (MLB, MLS, NBA, NFL, NHL, NWSL and WNBA) at 14 years and 293 days old. Freddy Adu previously held the mark for the youngest player to debut in the MLS, who made his debut for DC United in 2004 at 14 years and 306 days old. Adu gave his congratulations to Sullivan for breaking his record in a\u00a0post on X, formerly known as Twitter. \u201cBig congrats to Cavan Sullivan for his record breaking debut today,\u201d Adu wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s a hard record to break and the kid did it. Well done and good luck my man.\u201d Sullivan subbed on in the 85th minute and got cheers from the crowd on hand at Subaru Park in Chester, Pennsylvania. Sullivan, along with his older brother Quinn and the rest of his family, all posed for a picture on the field after the game. Quinn, who is a 20-year-old midfielder on the Union, scored in the 84th\u00a0minute. The Union, who currently sit last place in the Eastern Conference, got their fifth win of the season. After the match, the younger Sullivan said that \u201cthis was just the start\u201d when asked about the debut and his future in professional soccer. \u201cReally, really happy to have done this, but honestly, it\u2019s the first box checked off \u2013 so long journey ahead,\u201d Sullivan told reporters. \u201cI know it\u2019s all about where you finish, not where you start, so I am just going to keep working, keep developing here. So my main focus is on Philadelphia and our season ahead.\u201d Sullivan said the fans are what \u201csurprised\u201d him the most playing at this level. \u201cEvery time I touched the ball, they went crazy,\u201d Sullivan told reporters after the game.  \u201cObviously, I dreamed of this day and had some pictures in my mind of what it would look like but just hearing them behind my back every time the ball was at my foot was crazy.\u201d Sullivan has been impressive since signing a four-year deal through 2028 for the largest homegrown contract in MLS back in May. He has made five starts with Philadelphia\u2019s minor league team and scored in each of his last two matches. According to ESPN, Sullivan has a release clause that will allow him to transfer to English Premier League side Manchester City after he turns 18.

{"id": "2024_07_13_sport_soccer-player-jewish-teenager-germany-spt-intl", "text": "After Germany hosted the England soccer team in May 1938, Rolf Friedland waited patiently outside the stadium. The teenager was hoping to speak to some of soccer\u2019s biggest stars of the time \u2013 a feeling of anticipation that many sports fans have experienced. But for the German-Jewish 17-year-old, a lot more was at stake. Friedland knew that one of the soccer players who lined up that day had the power to save his life. And it was with the help of an England defender that Friedland was able to leave Germany, escape the persecution of the Nazis and start a new life overseas as Ralph Freeman. \u2018They\u2019re going to kill me\u2019 Freeman\u2019s family had already fled Germany without him, and he was left alone and isolated, knowing that leaving the country was essential for his survival. \u201cPsychologically, he was desperate to get out,\u201d Ralph\u2019s son Alan Freeman told CNN. \u201cHe was left there alone presumably with some sort of hope that his parents would be able to get him out, but I don\u2019t think he entirely relied on that.\u201d A lifelong soccer fan, Freeman\u2019s desperation to leave Nazi Germany led him to the Olympiastadion on that fateful day on May 14, 1938. He hatched a plan to try and gain the attention of an England player who could aid in his escape from Germany. \u201cI think that my dad was a creative individual and to do something like that, you need a degree of creativity,\u201d explains Alan. \u201cWhile there was a certain element of creative initiative, I think that it [the plan] was principally done out of desperation,\u201d he added. \u201c\u2019I just need to get out,\u2019\u201d said Alan of his father\u2019s attitude. \u201c\u2019I\u2019ll find any way to try and get out of it. If I don\u2019t get out of here, they\u2019re going to kill me.\u2019\u201d When the players made their exit from the stadium, it was England and Tottenham Hotspur defender Bert Sproston who stopped and listened to Freeman. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that he especially singled out Bert Sproston as the most likely person to help him,\u201d Alan said. \u201cHe simply spoke to that particular player and that particular player registered my father\u2019s desperation. \u201cIt obviously touched his heart and he decided to go back and do something about it.\u201d While Sproston would not have known the exact details of what life was like for a Jewish person living in Germany at the time, author and journalist John Leonard thinks he would have been aware of the Nazis\u2019 hostility towards Jews. In his book \u2018Salute!\u2019 Leonard looks at the how sport and politics clashed during this time \u2013 culminating in this famous match. \u201cI\u2019m sure he did realize that for Jewish people in Germany that, to put it politely, they were in for a hard time,\u201d Leonard told CNN. Michael Berkowitz, professor of modern Jewish history at University College London, agreed. \u201cEveryone was aware of it,\u201d Berkowitz told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s again important not to read backwards, but people did know that there was something going on that was just not normal by the standards of other places.\u201d After speaking to Sproston, who took his details back to Britain, Freeman was granted a visa to the UK to watch England play in a friendly game. He was finally able to leave Germany and avoid the events that would soon unfold. \u2018A crucial year\u2019 Europe was on the brink of war when England headed to Berlin in 1938.Geopolitical tensions were nearing a boiling point on the continent and Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party\u2019s power continued to grow throughout Europe. As the Nazis\u2019 influence increased, the treatment of the Jewish population of Germany dramatically worsened. \u201c1938 was a really crucial year,\u201d Berkowitz said. This was the year which saw the German annexation of Austria, commonly known as the Anschluss, in March as well as Kristallnacht \u2013\u00a0the night of broken glass\u00a0\u2013 in November of that year. Berkowitz explained that Hitler cautiously ramped up his abhorrent treatment of Jews after he came to power in 1933 but 1938 saw conditions dramatically worsen. \u201cIncluded in the annexation of Austria is incredible anti-Jewish action, including the burning of synagogues and Jews being beaten up on the streets,\u201d Berkowitz added. \u201cBut then even more striking was \u2026 what would later be called Kristallnacht,\u201d Berkowitz said. \u201cAlmost all of the synagogues in Germany were burnt down, literally hundreds, thousands of people beaten up in the streets [and], it was thought at first that there weren\u2019t that many people killed, now we know that there were many more people killed.\u201d According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, at least 91 Jews were killed, 30,000 German Jewish men were arrested and sent to concentration camps and hundreds of synagogues were set on fire during the events of November 9 and 10 1938. \u201cThat was when the world really woke up. Unified in horror at what the Nazis were up to,\u201d Leonard said. Thanks to Sproston\u2019s intervention, Freeman was able to board a train from Berlin and arrived in London just a matter of weeks before the events of November 9-10 unfolded. \u2018He saved his life\u2019 Sproston\u2019s connections through the footballing world proved to be vital in helping Freeman leave Germany. \u201cYou usually would need some sort of personal connection. You need someone to vouch for you, or you need to come in through some sort of organizational effort,\u201d Berkowitz said of the process of obtaining a visa to leave Germany as a Jew. \u201cBut just say purely as an individual or an individual without means.Wow. This is not easy to do.\u201d Sproston sponsoring Freeman\u2019s UK visa therefore proved invaluable to ensuring his escape from Germany. \u201cNot only did Bert Sproston change Ralph Freeman\u2019s life. He saved his life,\u201d Leonard added. \u201cWithout his intervention the chances were that young Ralph Freeman would have ended up in a concentration camp, and he would have been murdered by the Nazis.\u201d Leonard also said that unlike the majority of his England teammates, Sproston could look back on this game with a sense of pride. It was before this game that the England players famously performed the Nazi salute prior to kick off. Leonard stated that the England team was under considerable pressure to perform the Nazi salute as a form of appeasement but, by helping Freeman, Sproston can feel less guilty about the pre-match salute. \u201cHe [Sproston] was one of the players who left Berlin, after making a personal decision, as much as a team decision, that would haunt most of the players for the rest of their lives \u2013 he certainly could look back on that game with a touch of pride,\u201d said Leonard. \u2018The world would be a better place\u2019 Sproston passed away in 2000 and Ralph Freeman passed away in 2010, but Ralph\u2019s son Alan said the pair remained close after their first interaction. \u201cTo the day that Bert died they were in contact,\u201d Alan explained. Alan added that the pair were always pleased to see each other, and this good relationship has been passed on to the next generation as Alan keeps in touch with Janice, Sproston\u2019s daughter-in-law. Alan said he and Janice have a \u201cdeep, meaningful relationship and a friendship,\u201d built on the legacies and stories of their father and father-in-law. A love for football, and in particular Tottenham Hotspur, was also passed down from father to son and Alan fondly remembers following Tottenham with his father. But more importantly, so did the story of Bert Sproston helping Ralph Freeman in his bid to leave Nazi Germany. \u201cI just think that if all of us could just act with decency to other people in the way that Bert behaved towards my dad, then the world would be a better place,\u201d Alan said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/sport/soccer-player-jewish-teenager-germany-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Los Blancos announced last month that the club had signed Mbapp\u00e9 to a five-year deal, ending the French superstar\u2019s seven-year stint at Paris Saint-Germain. A montage of Real\u2019s successes throughout history and the sound of Luciano Pavarotti\u2019s rendition of \u201cNessun Dorma\u201d precluded Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s entrance into the stadium, followed by a highlight reel of the French superstar\u2019s goals shown on a big screen. This has been a highly-anticipated moment for Real Madrid fans, who have long been hopeful of seeing the 25-year-old \u2013 rated among the best current players in the world \u2013 wear their club\u2019s famous white jersey. Having won a 15th European crown at the end of last season, Real has only strengthened its squad, which already includes the likes of Vin\u00edcius Jr. and Jude Bellingham, with the signing of Mbapp\u00e9. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible day for me, incredible,\u201d the forward told those inside the stadium. \u201cSince I was a boy, I had only one dream: to play here. And to be here now means a lot to me. \u201cBecause of that, I want to thank every\u00a0madridista\u00a0because, since years ago, you\u2019ve given me a lot of affection, a lot of love \u2013 that goes directly to my heart. And so I want to say thank you to everyone to let me be here today.\u201d After his speech, Mbapp\u00e9 greeted fans in attendance, signing autographs and kicking footballs into the stands. His official unveiling concludes one of the longest-running transfer sagas in\u00a0soccer, with Mbapp\u00e9 long harboring ambitions of a move to the Spanish capital. Despite his considerable success in domestic competitions \u2013 winning six French league titles with PSG and one with AS Monaco \u2013 he is yet to add a Champions League to his list of career achievements. Mbapp\u00e9 played more than 300 games for PSG, scoring his 250th goal in March, and with France, he won the World Cup in 2018 and the Golden Boot in 2022, leading scoring at the tournament with eight goals. At the recently concluded European Championships, he captained France to a semifinal defeat against eventual champion Spain. \u201cNow, I have another dream,\u201d Mbapp\u00e9 added at his unveiling. \u201cThis is a dream that I have to accomplish: it\u2019s to meet the expectations of the history of this club, the best in the world. I can say one thing: I\u2019m going to give my life for this club and for this badge.\u201d The star evoked another soccer superstar in his presentation at multiple points: Cristiano Ronaldo. Mbapp\u00e9 mimicked his childhood hero by kissing the club badge at one point before telling those assembled in the Bernab\u00e9u, \u201cI\u2019m going to say one, two, three and we\u2019re all going to say together, \u2018Hala Madrid\u2019 like one big family,\u201d echoing Ronaldo\u2019s actions during his own Los Blancos presentation in the summer of 2009. \u201cOne, two, three\u2026 Hala Madrid!\u201d Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s parents were among the huge crowd in the stands for his unveiling as a Real player, while club legend Zinedine Zidane also greeted him as he stepped into the stadium. Also on Tuesday, Real announced that Mbapp\u00e9 had successfully completed his medical at the Hospital Universitario Sanitas La Moraleja in Madrid.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/sport/kylian-mbappe-real-madrid-unveiling-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Triathlon events are due to start at the city\u2019s Alexandre III Bridge later this month, but official testing by the city has shown E. coli bacteria levels have been above acceptable levels on the majority of days between June 3 and July 2, which would potentially expose athletes to serious health risks. The 65 year-old Hidalgo dunked her head in the river as she swam Wednesday, after previously claiming the water would be \u201cdepolluted, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d Last week French Sports Minister Am\u00e9lie Oud\u00e9a-Cast\u00e9ra also swam in the\u00a0Seine. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very cool to be here and it was a dream and now it\u2019s real \u2026 after the Games we will have a swimming pool in the river for all the people, for the Parisian people and for the tourists also,\u201d Hidalgo told reporters after the swim. Despite a 1.4 billion Euro (1.5 billion USD) clean-up plan for the Seine, where swimming has been illegal for\u00a0more than 100 years\u00a0due to pollution levels, concerns remain over the river\u2019s suitability for swimming events. Official data shows one-off rainfall events can quickly cause\u00a0E. coli\u00a0levels to spike again, and as recently as June 30, following rain the previous day,\u00a0E. coli\u00a0levels increased to around 2000 CFU/100mL at Alexandra III Bridge.

The defending champion dropped the first set to the American No. 12 seed on Court No. 1, but rallied to eventually win 5-7 6-4 6-2 6-2 in southwest London. \u201cAt the beginning, the first set and the beginning of the second set, it kind of felt like I was playing on clay. Big rallies, 10 to 15 shots every point,\u201d Alcaraz said in his on-court interview afterwards. \u201cSo I had to stay strong mentally when I lost the first set. \u201cIt was difficult for me a little bit, but I knew it was a long journey, a long match, and I just had to stay there. I\u2019m really happy to find the solutions and the good path.\u201d Alcaraz will play No. 5 seed Daniil Medvedev in the semifinals, in what is a rematch of their semifinal clash from last year\u2019s tournament. Paul had been in excellent grass-court form having won at Queen\u2019s \u2013 a Wimbledon warm-up tournament \u2013 and his quarterfinals appearance in SW19 was the furthest he\u2019d reached at the grand slam. The 27-year-old continued his impressive play on Tuesday against Alcaraz, winning the first set and holding a 2-0 lead in the second. But the Spaniard eventually found his range, in particular against Paul\u2019s serve. The 21-year-old broke his American opponent seven times across the final three sets of the match to provide himself the opportunity to build a lead. After three hours and 11 minutes, the three-time grand slam champion was able to wrap up a victory which sees him into the semifinals for the second successive year. \u201cI believe that I can come back,\u201d said Alcaraz, when asked how he works through difficult moments on court. \u201cIf I am struggling a little bit, I try to find the solutions if the opponent is playing great tennis. I believe that, at the end, I will be able to come back and find solutions, the good rhythm. \u201cToday\u2019s match is an example. Even here at the grand slams, where the matches are longer, I have more time to come back, so I believe in myself the whole time.\u201d Medvedev awaits for Alcaraz in the semifinals after the Russian beat world No. 1 Jannik Sinner in a five-set thriller on Centre Court on Tuesday. Sinner won the opening set, but the Italian was hampered by an illness early in the second set, calling a medical timeout in which he had his pulse checked by doctors and went off court to be further evaluated. When he returned, Medvedev looked a player renewed as he won the next two sets. Sinner did impressively win the fourth set but appeared to run out of steam in the final set as Medvedev booked his spot in the final four. \u201cIt is very tough because I could feel he wasn\u2019t moving that well,\u201d Medvedev said on court after his victory when asked about Sinner. \u201cYou want to play more points to make him suffer a little bit more, and at the same time, you know at one point he is going to think he can\u2019t run anymore and will go full power and that is what he did. \u201cHe had set points to win the third set. In a way, I would have preferred to not have this situation but everything turned out well.\u201d When Alcaraz and Medvedev played in last year\u2019s semifinal, the Spaniard dropped just nine games to ease into his debut Wimbledon final; Alcaraz won his maiden Wimbledon title by beating Novak Djokovic in a gripping five-set clash.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/sport/carlos-alcaraz-tommy-paul-wimbledon-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "sports"}}

According to\u00a0the reports,\u00a0Williams\u2019 contract includes a $25.5 million signing bonus. CNN Sport has reached out to the Bears and Williams\u2019 representatives for comment. Williams was the overwhelming favorite to be selected with the first pick in this year\u2019s draft after a productive college career with the University of Southern California. In 2022, the quarterback won the Heisman Trophy, breaking Trojan records in passing touchdowns, passing yards and passing efficiency that season. Although he endured somewhat of a down year last season, Williams possesses all the attributes required to be a high-level quarterback in the NFL. His throwing ability in various scenarios combined with his athletic talents make him the perfect example of the modern dual-threat QB and have led to comparisons to former No. 1 overall pick Kyler Murray. The Bears traded away previous starter Justin Fields in the offseason, clearing the runway for Williams to lead the franchise with a young core. Williams\u2019 contract news came on the same day that his fellow rookie, wide receiver Rome Odunze, also reportedly agreed terms on his contract. Odunze, who was selected ninth in the 2024 Draft, agreed to a $22.7 million fully guaranteed rookie deal which includes a $13.3 million signing bonus, per reports.

{"id": "2024_07_16_sport_gareth-southgate-leaves-england-mens-team-euro-2024-final-spt-intl", "text": "Gareth Southgate announced on Tuesday he will leave his role as the manager of the England men\u2019s national team. His decision comes two days after England\u2019s 2-1 defeat by Spain in the Euro 2024 final in Berlin. That was the second consecutive final at the European Championships which the Three Lions had lost. Southgate spent eight years as England\u2019s manager, taking charge of 102 matches. \u201cAs a proud Englishman, it has been the honor of my life to play for England and to manage England. It has meant everything to me, and I have given it my all,\u201d said the 53-year-old Southgate. \u201cBut it\u2019s time for change, and for a new chapter. Sunday\u2019s final in Berlin against Spain was my final game as England manager.\u201d Southgate took charge of England at four major international tournaments, reaching the semifinals at the 2018 World Cup and the quarterfinals in Qatar two years ago. England had won seven knockout games in the 25 international tournaments since winning the World Cup in 1966 before Southgate took over, and in the four he has been manager of the team, the Three Lions won nine. After years of underachieving on the international stage since winning the World Cup 58 years ago, Southgate is also credited with instilling a positive atmosphere around the team. However, during Euro 2024 in Germany, England\u2019s style of play came under scrutiny, with some fans throwing plastic cups onto the pitch following the 0-0 draw with Slovenia, a result which confirmed the team\u2019s spot in the last 16. But as England made its way through the tournament, Southgate recaptured the majority of supporters\u2019 goodwill, in particular through his team\u2019s propensity for late-game heroics. England fell agonizingly short against Spain in the final though to become the first team ever to lose back-to-back Euros finals. \u201cThe squad we took to Germany is full of exciting young talent and they can win the trophy we all dream of,\u201d said Southgate. \u201cI am so proud of them, and I hope we get behind the players and the team at St. George\u2019s Park and the FA who strive every day to improve English football, and understand the power football has to drive positive change.\u201d St. George\u2019s Park is the \u201chome\u201d to all 23 of England\u2019s national football teams, according to the English Football Association. Southgate added: \u201cWe have the best fans in the world, and their support has meant the world to me. I\u2019m an England fan and I always will be.\u201d Southgate was appointed England manager in 2016 after the abrupt departure of Sam Allardyce. Southgate was a familiar face to many members of the senior national team after working with the Under-21 team between 2013 and 2016. As England manager, Southgate won 62 of the 102 games he presided over. Prince William, who is the president of the English FA \u2013 thanked Southgate for all the work he has done as the team\u2019s manager. \u2018Class act\u2019 \u201cThank you for creating a team that stands shoulder to shoulder with the world\u2019s finest in 2024,\u201d the Prince of Wales wrote on X. \u201cThank you for showing humility, compassion, and true leadership under the most intense pressure and scrutiny. \u201cAnd thank you for being an all-round class act. You should be incredibly proud of what you\u2019ve achieved.\u201d During his playing days, Southgate was a defender who played in the Premier League for Crystal Palace, Aston Villa and Middlesborough. He earned 57 caps as a player, with his international playing career most known for the decisive penalty he had saved in Euro 1996 semfinal against Germany which resulted in England\u2019s elimination from the tournament. The FA\u2019s CEO Mark Bullingham said that it is \u201cvery proud of everything Gareth and Steve achieved for England, and will be forever grateful to them.\u201d \u201cGareth has made the impossible job possible and laid strong foundations for future success. He is held in the highest regard by the players, the backroom team, by everyone at The FA and across the world of football.\u201d Bullingham added that the process for a new England manager is underway.

Medvedev, the No. 5 seed, advances to his second Wimbledon semifinal with a 6-7 (9-7) 6-4 7-6 (7-4) 2-6 6-3 victory and is aiming to win his second grand slam after his success at the 2021 US Open. Sinner, who rose to the top of the men\u2019s tennis rankings after the French Open, had previously won the five past meetings against Medvedev. That included the Australian Open final earlier this year, when Sinner won his first grand slam title after coming back from two sets down. Play was paused during their quarterfinal when Sinner, who looked unwell and had his pulse taken, left the court for a medical assessment when he was down a break in the third set after three games. The pair had split the first two sets. There was what appeared to be a look of concern on the face of Sinner\u2019s coach, Darren Cahill. Following Sinner\u2019s return after the timeout, the Italian would go on to break back, but it was Medvedev who took the third set tiebreak and a two-sets-to-one lead. Sinner refused to go quietly, forcing a fifth set, but an early break by Medvedev gave the momentum back to the Russian. Meanwhile, reigning Wimbledon champion Carlos\u00a0Alcaraz\u00a0won his 12th consecutive match at the grass court grand slam, defeating Tommy Paul in four sets. The American Paul took an early lead over the world No. 3 - earning the opening set 7-5 and went up a break in the following set - but was ultimately pegged back by the Spaniard.

{"id": "2023_02_05_sport_head-injury-suicide-female-athletes-intl-spt-cmd", "text": "Kelly Catlin and Ellie Soutter never met, but they had a lot in common.  Both were commanding athletes: Catlin, a US track cyclist, was a three-times world champion and Olympic silver medalist, and Soutter, a snowboarder, was tipped to be one of Team Great Britain\u2019s strongest contenders for the 2022 Winter Olympics, having already won a bronze medal at the 2017 European Youth Olympic Festival.  Both were incredibly smart \u2013 Catlin was studying for a master\u2019s degree in computational and mathematical engineering at Stanford University, while Soutter learned to speak French in about six months, according to her father.   At times they almost seemed superhuman. In 2013, after only three weeks of formal training and having broken her wrist, Soutter became British Champion with her arm in a cast. Meanwhile, Catlin, who had a tenderness for children, once rode 80 miles through sleet and snow to speak to a grade school about her Olympic experience.    Yet these two women\u2019s lives were tragically cut short after they sustained serious head injuries in their pursuit of sporting greatness and then took their own lives. Catlin was 23, while Soutter died by suicide on her 18th birthday.  Females may be more susceptible to concussion, and they also have worse and prolonged symptoms after their injury than men, according to a review of 25 studies of sport-related concussion published in the Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine.  However, women remain significantly underrepresented within sport and exercise science research. This, leading experts warn, means they often do not get the treatment or aftercare they need following a head injury.  Women\u2019s sports have historically not received the same attention or funding as men\u2019s sports, Dr. Ann McKee, Director of the Boston University Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s been shown that women athletes are more likely to get a concussion, they tend to have longer recovery periods,\u201d McKee added. \u201cWe do not have enough information about what happens in the female brain. We don\u2019t know if women are biologically more susceptible to these injuries,\u201d she said, adding that some research suggests the size and musculature of women\u2019s necks could play a part. Kelly  Before becoming a track cyclist, Catlin, a triplet, was a national champion road cyclist and time trial national champion, her father Mark, told CNN. After winning a Canadian international race at 17 she was invited to an Olympic training camp for a try out, where, impressed by her performance numbers, coaches immediately offered her a position on the track pursuit team.  Catlin\u2019s father, Mark, told CNN, that his daughter was \u201cintense\u201d and \u201cambitious,\u201d attributes she channeled into her sporting life. Her life changed irrevocably in January 2019. Practicing fast downhill descents in the hills near Los Angeles, she crashed and went skidding down the road.  Despite suffering road rash, Catlin got back on her bike, and finished the ride. It wasn\u2019t her first crash \u2013 she had experienced 4 or 5 hard crashes before this, her father said, and after the latest, she didn\u2019t have any symptoms at the time.  But soon after, at a World Cup track event in Berlin, Catlin was gripped by a sudden and severe headache.   \u201cShe couldn\u2019t compete,\u201d her father said. \u201cKelly is kind of this stoical individual. And if she\u2019s rolling around on the ground, clutching her head, it has to be a severe thing.\u201d On closer inspection, Catlin\u2019s helmet from LA had dents in it. Her father told CNN that this, coupled with her symptoms, caused her family to become aware she had suffered a concussion, which was later confirmed with a diagnosis from Stanford\u2019s Health Centre.  A concussion is a brain injury which happens after a hit to the head or body causes the brain to move back and forth inside the skull, according to the CDC. When Catlin returned to the US, her father says she was examined by the track training center in Colorado. It was confirmed she suffered a concussion, and a return to training protocol was advised, but not implemented or communicated to her coach, he said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any follow-up from Colorado after this. I believe they assumed she would seek care at Stanford,\u201d he told CNN.  CNN has reached out to Stanford and USA Cycling for comment.  Catlin\u2019s symptoms didn\u2019t improve, and in weekly phone calls with her parents, she admitted she was struggling with schoolwork and was unable to concentrate. Stanford Health Center, having diagnosed Catlin with concussion with ongoing symptoms, recommended that she decrease her training for 2 weeks and then gradually build back up and start sessions with an athletic trainer, medical documents sent to CNN by her father show. She was referred to a concussion specialist, the document adds. She tried to train, but \u201cshe would have to stop because she got a severe headache just from walking,\u201d according to her father. Her heart rate would also accelerate rapidly from even the smallest exertion, leaving her with \u201cno exercise tolerance whatsoever,\u201d he added.  Her injury had other consequences. \u201cAs far as we knew she was never a person that suffered from depression. She had an interesting sense of humor.  She was always upbeat and bubbly about things,\u201d her father told CNN.  \u201cShe basically thought her life was over. She was no longer able to be the athlete that she was, she was failing her teammates. And she wasn\u2019t able to succeed in school now. And I think ultimately, that\u2019s why she took her life, because she thought her life was over,\u201d he added.  At the end of January, Catlin made a serious but non-fatal suicide attempt, and was involuntarily admitted to the locked psychiatric ward at Stanford, her father told CNN. A month after that attempt, she took her own life.     Ellie   Soutter\u2019s father Tony said there were many dimensions to his young daughter \u2013 not only was she an \u201cadrenaline junkie,\u201d but she was \u201cvery conscientious\u201d and excelled in school, even after moving from England to France.   Aged 12, Soutter took up snowboarding at school \u2013 and just months later, she was spotted in her hometown resort of Les Gets and trialed by Team Great Britain in February 2013.  \u201cIt was quite obvious why she kept winning competitions because she just made it easy,\u201d her father said. \u201cShe just made it look graceful and beautiful.\u201d But training took its toll \u2013 Soutter told CNN that his daughter suffered seven major concussions in five years, between 2013 and 2018.  \u201cI was being advised by doctors \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, she\u2019s young enough she\u2019ll bounce back. As she progressed, becoming an elite athlete starting on the World Cup circuit, every time she had another concussion, they got worse, and they took longer to recover from,\u201d he told CNN.     \u201cWith every concussion, with the exception of a few minor knocks, Ellie saw a doctor in person,\u201d he added. \u201cI was always told that she was young enough to bounce back to full health after each case and therefore never consulted with the doctors that I met, about any previous concussions.\u201d But Soutter\u2019s final concussion was so \u201chuge\u201d that she spent two nights in the hospital. \u201cWhen I got there, she didn\u2019t even know who I was or where she was,\u201d her father said. Soutter was then selected for the Junior Snowboard World Championships in New Zealand August 2018.  But a month before the competition, she died by suicide.  Her father said a neurologist conducted a CT scan of her brain and reaction tests three months after her final concussion, but said she was \u201cabsolutely fine\u201d and could continue competing.                                                                                                                                 Like Catlin, Soutter had issues with studying and concentrating, becoming more insular as she suffered from crippling headaches. She also started suffering from insomnia.  \u201cShe would literally sit with the tutor a good month after a concussion, and suddenly, she\u2019d go blind. She\u2019d not be able to see \u2013 everything would go black and dark,\u201d her father said. After missing a flight to snowboard training, Soutter died by suicide on her 18th birthday. Team GB referred CNN to GB Snowsport when approached for comment, adding that Ellie only competed for Team GB at one event.  In order to represent Britain in international competitions, GB Snowsport says athletes or their coaches are required to demonstrate that the athlete has reached established performance criteria, is of the relevant technical ability to compete, and has appropriate medical clearance to compete. A large number of athletes can represent Britain at different levels of international competition but are not part of a programme delivered and overseen by GB Snowsport.  \u201cAs Ellie was not part of the GB Snowsport programme, we were unable to implement a personalised recovery and management programme for Ellie,\u201d a spokesperson for GB Snowsport told CNN in an email. \u201cShe was, however, covered by national policies and protocols around fitness to compete, and would not have been cleared for any activity \u2013 training or competition \u2013 overseen by GB Snowsport without being able to demonstrate appropriate medical sign-off,\u201d they added. The spokesperson for GB Snowsport told CNN: \u201cWe take concussions and head injuries incredibly seriously, and in reviewing contemporaneous records from the time that Ellie was involved in snowsport we are confident that GB Snowsport staff applied and followed every appropriate process.\u201d Catlin and Soutter aren\u2019t the only young sporting women whose lives have been cut short in this way. After 29-year-old Australian rules football player Jacinda Barclay took her life in 2020, post-mortem research by scientists found that she had degradation to her cerebral white matter unusual for someone her age.  \u201cFor someone her age, you would expect to see lovely pristine white matter, and hers looked like she was an old woman in that it was basically degraded,\u201d Michael Buckland, founder and Executive Director of the Australian Sports Brain Bank, who studied Barclay\u2019s brain, told CNN.  \u201cWe haven\u2019t gone back and done specific white matter studies on our donors,\u201d he told CNN, adding that the bank hasn\u2019t done peer reviewed research on this.  \u201cBut what struck me, just as someone that sees a lot of brains \u2013 this is not normal for someone of that age.\u201d  Damage to white matter has been associated with dementia, according to research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.   Opportunities missed Suicide after concussion is rare. However patients diagnosed with concussion or mild traumatic brain injury had double the risk of suicide and a higher risk of suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts than people without brain injuries, a 2018 study from researchers at the University of Harvard published in JAMA Neurology found. Dr. Robert Cantu, clinical professor of neurology at the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at Boston University School of Medicine told CNN that there are several theories as to why incidence of suicide is higher in people who have suffered concussion. One theory, he explained, is that those suffering from persistent post-concussion symptoms may have structural or functional brain damage and could be experiencing \u201cbehavioral dysregulation: short fuse, irritability, [and] can\u2019t suppress impulses the way you normally could.\u201d   With these emotional problems, \u201cthey would be more prone to perhaps do something impulsive, like commit suicide,\u201d Cantu, medical director of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, told CNN. A second theory, Cantu noted, is that post-concussive symptoms prevent people from getting back into their sport and stop them \u201cfrom being the person that they were before their injury.\u201d Neither theory is proven to the exclusion of the other, Cantu said, adding he thinks increased suicidality was \u201ca combined factor involving both in many, if not most cases.\u201d There are also differences in the way brain injuries affect women.  A study of female soccer players across US high schools found they are nearly twice as likely to suffer concussion as their male counterparts, according to research that looked at over 80,000 adolescent athletes, published in the journal JAMA Network Open.  Women remain significantly underrepresented within sport and exercise science research: a 2021 study examining papers from some of the most influential sports medical journals found that only 6% of the studies were solely focused on women, compared with 31% of studies that included just men. Other researchers have pointed to female sex hormones, with risk of concussion changing with hormone levels during a menstrual cycle.  McKee said all athletes can also experience \u201cnon-concussive\u201d injuries: \u201chits to the head that can be of the same magnitude as concussion, but they don\u2019t rise to the level of symptoms for whatever reason, so a player tends to play right through it.\u201d Cumulative exposure to repetitive head impacts \u2013 including concussion and non- concussive injuries \u2013 increases the risk for the neurodegenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known as CTE, McKee said.  The disease, which can only be formally diagnosed with an autopsy, has mostly been seen in either veterans or people who played contact sports, particularly American football, say researchers. The disease occurs when the brain starts to degenerate likely due to repeated head traumas, according to the Mayo Clinic, which notes CTE is \u201cassociated with recurrent concussions.\u201d But scientists aren\u2019t only concerned about concussions.  Previous studies have shown subconcussive head impacts \u2013 repetitive hits to the head and body that do not cause symptoms \u2013 can still result in long-term neurological disease.   According to The Concussion Legacy Foundation, \u201cthe best available evidence suggests that subconcussive impacts, not concussions, are the driving force behind CTE.\u201d There have been cases of CTE discovered in athletes who have never been diagnosed with a concussion, according to the Concussion Legacy Foundation. And other changes in the brain after repetitive head impacts aside from CTE are likely \u201cequally important,\u201d McKee said. \u201cWe also see damage to the white matter. And that appears to be mostly in the frontal lobe, but also in the temporal lobes,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to understand the relationship of those white matter changes to behavioral and mood symptoms, perhaps even suicidality,\u201d she said.  McKee stressed that concussion management is important, but physicians and athletes should also be aware of other injuries. \u201cThe problem is the subclinical hits \u2013 the non-concussive injuries that aren\u2019t detected, you don\u2019t pull the player off the field \u2013 and they can be in the hundreds or even the 1000s in a single season,\u201d she explained. Lack of research  Though a growing body of data suggests women in sport are more likely to sustain a concussion, have more severe symptoms, and to take longer to recover, most sports-related concussions protocols are based on data from men.  In a review in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers looked at 171 concussion studies written since 1967 which are used to inform the most influential consensus and position statements in treating sports-related concussions. Clinicians rely on these documents to guide their medical practice when treating athletes \u2013 but most of the studies are focused on men. Only 1% of them was looking exclusively at concussions in women and 40% of them didn\u2019t have any women in a sample of participants at all.   There is another risk factor for women in sport when they sustain head injuries, Katherine Snedaker, founder and executive director of PINK Concussions, a non-profit dedicated to women\u2019s health and brain injury, told CNN.  There is a gulf of millions of dollars separating women and men when it comes to average annual salaries in most professional sports. Outside of elite sport, Snedaker says, female athletes often don\u2019t have access to the same medical care as men, meaning head injuries aren\u2019t spotted as routinely.   \u201cThey tend to push really hard through the injury,\u201d she said. And many women can\u2019t afford to take time out to recover: even professional athletes will supplement their sports income with other jobs, she added, and many are caregivers. \u201cWhen they really crater, it\u2019s a couple of days or weeks later.\u201d  Snedaker said female athletes often weren\u2019t aware they had suffered a head injury. If they were, she said, there were no appropriate medical or sporting staff to inform. Not enough support The families of Catlin and Soutter feel the young women didn\u2019t get enough support after their injuries. After Catlin\u2019s first suicide attempt, she was released from an involuntary admission to the psychiatric ward after threatening legal action, and a conference between psychiatrists, her coach and her parents.  She attended therapy sessions, which she agreed to attend during the conference, but found \u201cthey were geared toward suicidal freshman with a whole set of different issues than an elite Olympic athlete,\u201d her father told CNN. She got a referral to a sports psychologist that worked with the Stanford athletic department, but the department forbade the psychologist from seeing Catlin because she was not a varsity athlete, her father added.  She contacted the office of a sports psychologist with whom she had developed a rapport while in the hospital \u2013 but, his appointment secretary said he had no openings for six months, her father told CNN.  \u201cWherever she turned she could not find help,\u201d he said, adding that his daughter tried a suicide hotline several times: she was once put on hold and once received no answer. Catlin described his daughter as a \u201cstoic, female warrior type person that isn\u2019t going to admit that she\u2019s struggling.\u201d  \u201cShe needed a sports psychiatrist that really could understand what she was going through and understand the rigors of her life in terms of preparation for competitions and the athletic side of it and what it could potentially do to you.\u201d Her father said a major factor in his daughter\u2019s death was \u201ca lack of communication between the facilities that were involved in Kelly\u2019s care. No one was in charge and they assumed the other institutions were following up when they weren\u2019t,\u201d he added. In a statement sent to CNN, Luisa Rapport, director of emergency communications and media relations at Stanford University did not address any of the specific allegations made by Catlin\u2019s family.  She said while the university does not discuss in the media the details of individual students\u2019 experiences, \u201csupporting the mental and emotional health of students is a critical priority for Stanford.\u201d  \u201cStudents in need of mental health crisis assistance \u2013 including students having suicidal thoughts \u2013 and those who are concerned about students in need of assistance, can contact the University\u2019s Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) 24 hours-a-day, seven days-a-week,\u201d she added. Rapport said that in addition to this, \u201cthere are multiple places where psychological services may be provided for students depending on individualized need and treatment recommendations, including, for example, affiliated hospital services and clinics through Stanford\u2019s Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, and mental health programs and clinicians in the community.\u201d In a statement sent to CNN, USA Cycling said it was \u201cdevastated\u201d by Catlin\u2019s death, adding: \u201cShe brought focus and determination to everything she did, and served as an inspiration to everyone who knew her.  \u201cAs the National Governing Body for the sport of cycling, USA Cycling prioritizes the holistic wellbeing of the riders on the U.S. National Team and has a longstanding commitment to providing both physical and mental health resources to members of the team,\u201d a representative for USA Cycling added.   After his daughter Ellie\u2019s death, Soutter was contacted by the UNITE Brain Bank, who wanted to study her brain as part of their research into CTE. But even in that facility \u2013 the biggest of its kind in the world \u2013 of some 1,300 brains, only 3% belonged to women, Ann McKee, Director of the Boston University Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center told CNN. \u201cWhen I actually started looking into CTE \u2013 all of the work that they\u2019ve done with the footballers in America, she had every single symptom and more,\u201d Soutter told CNN. \u201cIt was quite obvious to me that there was a definite link in her starting to get into dark places and feeling bad and anxious and not sleeping properly. All of those symptoms \u2026 Every one that\u2019s involved in CTE was part of Ellie\u2019s life,\u201d he added. \u201cI truly believe today that my daughter would be alive had I had any inkling, you know, even the smallest bit of information.\u201d Editor\u2019s Note: If you are in the US and you or a loved one have contemplated suicide, call The National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255) to connect with a trained counselor.

Kate and Charlotte greeted several British tennis players, including Emma Raducanu, before taking their seats in the Royal Box for the showdown between reigning champion Carlos Alcaraz and seven-time winner Novak Djokovic. Kate \u2013 who is known to have a passion for sports and is an enthusiastic tennis fan - has been patron of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club since 2016. It is only her second public appearance this year following her cancer diagnosis. It was found after she underwent major abdominal surgery shortly after Christmas and spent almost two weeks in the London Clinic hospital. In June, Kate - who is still undergoing treatment - delighted royal-watchers joining King Charles III and family members for the Trooping the Colour ceremony to mark the monarch\u2019s official birthday. The popular royal offered an update on her health journey last month, saying that she was making \u201cgood progress\u201d in her recovery. She added that there were \u201cgood days and bad days\u201d but that while she was hoping to participate in more engagements over the summer, she acknowledged she was \u201cnot out of the woods yet.\u201d It\u2019s a busy weekend for the Wales family. While Kate is in southwest London for the tennis final, her husband Prince William is due in Berlin for the UEFA Euro 2024 final between England and Spain. The Prince of Wales is the president of England\u2019s Football Association (FA) and a regular sight at England football games. He previously attended England\u2019s quarter-final victory against Switzerland in D\u00fcsseldorf last Saturday. In a message on social media posted a day before the final clash, William wrote: \u201cWe are so proud of you all @england, just one last push to finish the job! Go out there and show the world what you\u2019re made of. We believe.\u201d King Charles also sent Gareth Southgate\u2019s team his \u201cwarmest congratulations\u201d on reaching the final. In a message on Wednesday, he sent the royal family\u2019s \u201cbest wishes.\u201d  He also joked: \u201cIf I may encourage you to secure victory before the need for any last minute wonder-goals or another penalties drama, I am sure the stresses on the nation\u2019s collective heart rate and blood pressure would be greatly alleviated!\u201d The England men\u2019s team has never won the Euros. Spain has already won the prestigious title three times.

{"id": "2024_07_04_sport_hyrox-meg-jacoby-celia-duff-olympics-spt-intl", "text": "It\u2019s a race that requires a mesmerizing mix of strength and endurance; one that pushes the fittest of the fit to the edge of what they think is possible. And now, after a steady start, the fitness phenomenon that is HYROX has finally found its stride. HYROX is a functional fitness race which involves an eight-kilometer (almost five-mile) run interspersed with eight workout stations. Each station requires participants to perform a different exercise \u2013 SkiErg, sled push, sled pull, burpee broad jumps, rowing, farmer\u2019s carry, sandbag lunges and the dreaded wall balls. Competitors are able to compete in teams, pairs or by themselves. No matter the age or ability, the race format remains the same \u2013 the only difference being the differing weights used at the stations. HYROX\u2019s first iteration in 2017 saw 618 participants, while now it boasts more than 210,000 across 30 cities. CNN recently spoke to two women at the forefront of HYROX\u2019S charge to discover what life is like at the top of the latest fitness craze. Meg Jacoby Meg Jacoby is the newly crowned world champion, demolishing the elite women\u2019s field at the World Championships in Nice, France, in June. The American was the first ever woman to complete a HYROX race in under one hour and only recently saw her solo world record beaten by compatriot Lauren Weeks. After she crossed the finish line, cementing her first world title, Jacoby fell to the floor in an equal measure of exhaustion and jubilation, where she was greeted by her nine-year-old daughter. \u201cMy daughter has sacrificed just as much, if not more, than I have because she\u2019s sacrificing a lot of time away from me so I can do what I need to do and be living my dream as an athlete,\u201d Jacoby tells CNN Sport. \u201cIt felt like it was all worth it. Having her there was just really, really special. She gets to witness so many strong, powerful, incredible women when she gets to watch my races \u2013 not just me.\u201d Jacoby only heard about HYROX in 2022. She signed up for the New York race later that year and started working with HYROX coach Rich Ryan. Despite admitting to some errors during her first race, Jacoby delivered an impressive time in New York. Four weeks later, in only her second race, the American broke the then women\u2019s pro world record in Chicago. \u201cAt that point, I knew I should probably go all in. It was pretty crazy to have that kind of success so quickly, but it seemed like just the right sport for me,\u201d Jacoby tells CNN. Despite somewhat stumbling upon HYROX, Jacoby had unknowingly been preparing for the sport for years. Her competitive streak was evident from an early age, with sports playing a major role in her upbringing \u2013 Jacoby\u2019s brother is also a professional bodybuilder. During college, she was an impressive middle-distance runner and has since competed in long-distance challenges. When a lot of the road races were suspended during the Covid lockdowns, Jacoby then turned her attention to powerlifting. Before discovering HYROX, when people asked Jacoby what she was training for in the gym, her answer was emphatic: \u201cI want to be hard to kill.\u201d Jacoby has now quit her day job to focus fully on being a professional athlete. She runs up to seven times a week and combines endurance sessions with hours in the gym. Jacoby says she trains for two or three sessions per day but is aware that might sound \u201cintimidating\u201d to other people. \u201cYou can have a lot of success in this without having to do that type of volume,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s just kind of where I\u2019m at and what I know works for me and what my body needs.\u201d Jacoby knows the importance of diet and recovery. She aims to sleep at least eight hours every night and fuels her body with a high-carb, high-protein diet. \u201cMy diet is very boring,\u201d she laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of chicken and rice. It\u2019s kind of mundane, but that\u2019s kind of the life of an athlete. It\u2019s repetitive.\u201d Despite being in gladiator-like shape, even Jacoby struggles to describe what a HYROX race feels like. \u201cI think all of us at this level are a little bit crazy,\u201d she says, explaining why she has picked such a grueling sport. \u201cWe have a lot of enjoyment for pain and suffering.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m always discovering more and more about myself as a person, pushing myself to my limits and kind of seeing what I\u2019m made of.\u201d Jacoby says the sense of community is another reason she dedicates her life to HYROX and says she finds inspiration from all corners of the sport \u2013 notably some of the other mothers who balance training with raising a family. She is also aware of another athlete, from London, who is excelling at the other end of the scale \u2013 with a badass moniker to match. The \u2018Badass Gran\u2019 Celia Duff, who is 70, was recently crowned world champion in the 70-74 category \u2013 an accolade to go alongside the 65-69 world title she won last year. She has also been a world record holder twice but is quick to point out that both her records have since been broken. \u201cI have an allotment, I have chickens, I have a dog. I help with the grandchildren, when help is needed, and pick them up from school and so on. I\u2019m very busy doing not a huge amount,\u201d Duff tells CNN Sport, drastically underplaying her quite astonishing achievements on an international stage. Like Jacoby, Duff found the sport of HYROX somewhat by mistake. Duff\u2019s daughter was an early adopter of the phenomenon and one day asked her mom to come along to an event in October 2022. Duff had always kept herself fit \u2013 she was a good rower during her youth and stepped up her fitness routine during the Covid lockdowns. But after agreeing to compete at her first HYROX event, Duff started reading up about the race and quickly realized she was in for a tough day. Incredibly, though, she went on to break the world record for her 65-69 category, in a time which qualified her for the 2023 World Championships in Manchester, England \u2013 a race she also went on to win. Duff says there is only a \u201ctiny\u201d number of people her age competing in HYROX \u2013 perhaps unsurprisingly given the physical toll it has on the body. But for Duff, a retired public health doctor, the sport gives her focus and the training helps her to stay young. The grandmother runs three times a week, mixing up the pace and distance of each session. She also works with a coach for her strength training and spends time practicing the exact movements she is required to do for the HYROX stations. Rest, though, is almost as important, and Duff takes at least a day off per week to allow her body to recover. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly important to keep mobile and strong as you get older because, if you don\u2019t, the rate at which you deteriorate increases,\u201d she says, explaining the \u201cwhy\u201d behind her participation. \u201cI want to be strong and functionally fit. That\u2019s the key to HYROX.\u201d Dubbed the \u201cBadass Gran,\u201d Duff isn\u2019t altogether comfortable with being called an \u201cinspiration\u201d to others, but a brief look through the comments posted on her Instagram demonstrates just how much she is motivating others to get fit. \u201cI\u2019m genuinely humble and grateful,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I can encourage older people or anybody, actually, just to get up and have a go, then great.\u201d Despite her short but impressive career as as HYROX athlete, Duff says it would be \u201cbonkers\u201d for her to continue racing because of the \u201cbody-breaking\u201d work involved. However, she does plan on competing with her daughter in a doubles event later this year and wants to continue being involved with the sport. Olympic aspirations Duff and Jacoby are proof that something is working for HYROX. The business was set up in 2017 by events organizer Christian Toetzke and three-time Olympic hockey medalist Moritz F\u00fcrste. F\u00fcrste says the concept took a while for people to understand and the business was badly hampered by Covid, which forced the cancelation of races around the world. Now, though, HYROX is seeing exponential growth and is racing to catch up with the increased demand. Some former athletes have also tested themselves against the challenge, including former NFL linebacker Curt Maggitt and ex-soccer star John Terry. \u201cIt took time to break through in a certain way, to really get into that wider range of people, seeing what it is and stepping out of that shadow,\u201d co-founder F\u00fcrste tells CNN. With its growing popularity, HYROX is now looking to further professionalize the sport, which has Olympic aspirations. Earlier this year, anti-doping measures were brought into the single and doubles rulebooks, meaning HYROX athletes are now held to the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). \u201cWe are not there yet, but if one day HYROX would be an Olympic sport, that would be the ultimate goal and achievement and just a very, very cool thing,\u201d F\u00fcrste adds. Before even entertaining Olympic status,\u00a0though, F\u00fcrste says a governing body and national federations would need to be created \u2013 things that take time to set up. But there is certainly appetite from the athletes, and Jacoby hopes to one day represent her country. \u201cYou won\u2019t be seeing me going away until then,\u201d says Jacoby when asked about the sport\u2019s progression towards Olympic status. \u201cTo be an Olympic athlete is the absolute highest level you could ever reach.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/sport/hyrox-meg-jacoby-celia-duff-olympics-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_sport_ukraine-athletes-paris-olympics-spt-intl", "text": "Kateryna Tabashnyk couldn\u2019t hold back her tears \u2013 not necessarily because her attempt to qualify for her first Olympics had fallen short, but because she was now reflecting on all the grief and pain of the past two-and-a-half years. The 30-year-old high jumper cleared 1.89 meters at the Ukrainian Athletics Championships on Sunday, not enough to qualify for this year\u2019s Olympic Games in Paris. But the fact that she had even come so close was a testament to her remarkable willpower and perseverance. Tabashnyk\u2019s mother was killed in a Russian airstrike on Kharkiv two years ago. She had stayed in the eastern city to help her young nephew, who was seriously injured in an earlier attack by Russian forces. Tabashnyk decided to return to competition a month later, viewing sport as a means to honor her mother\u2019s life even in the depths of grief. \u201cOf course, it affects people and, of course, me \u2013 the loss of my home, the loss of my dear mother, the loss of friends,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cAll this takes strength, takes energy. It\u2019s like a poison for the body.\u201d \u201cWe have to prepare to compete and show results against this background. Of course, it\u2019s very hard, it\u2019s very difficult, but to be honest, I don\u2019t know where I\u2019ve been getting this energy, this strength for the last two years. It\u2019s something incredible, even for me.\u201d Ukraine will send a team of more than 100 athletes to Paris, and \u2013 though that\u2019s fewer than the country had in Tokyo three years ago \u2013 their participation will likely feel more significant. The Ukrainian athletes competing at the games have endured a myriad of challenges since Russia\u2019s invasion, including facilities being destroyed, friends and relatives being killed and uncertainty about what the future might hold. According to Ukraine\u2019s Sports Ministry, about 3,000 athletes \u2013 from Olympic and non-Olympic sports \u2013 have served for the country\u2019s military, either voluntarily or by being drafted, and 479 have been killed while serving or in civilian life. More than 500 sports facilities have been destroyed, including 15 Olympic training bases. Tabashnyk won bronze at the European Indoor Championships earlier this year \u2013 her first medal at a major event \u2013 and was hoping to be part of Ukraine\u2019s first Olympic team since Russia launched its full-scale invasion with the support of Belarus in February 2022. She had been confident of making the team before a recent injury hampered her preparation for the national championships in Lviv. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how many times I wanted to give it all up, give up on sports, on jumping,\u201d Tabashnyk said. \u201cBut every time I pull myself together and say, \u2018No, now I have to fight like never before.\u2019 And so it goes every time, no matter what obstacle stands in my way.\u201d She is far from the only Ukrainian athlete whose life has been scarred by Russia\u2019s invasion of their country. Many athletes have moved abroad in order to continue their careers and train for this year\u2019s Games. That includes 400-meter hurdler Viktoriia Tkachuk, who has become accustomed to undertaking the 46-hour trip from Ukraine to her training camp in South Africa. Tkachuk\u2019s brother was called up to the frontline in May last year, and since then, her whole family has been fraught with fear about his safety. \u201cWe were all stressed out because we were thinking, \u2018Oh, no, he\u2019s not ready yet, he cannot go there,\u2019\u201d the 29-year-old told CNN. \u201cBut we were doing our best to support him, because if he\u2019s worrying, then he will feel our worries and it will not help him.\u201d Tkachuk saw her brother in February when he had a break from military service, and the pair are in regular contact while they go about their separate lives. \u201cHe\u2019s texted me a message: \u2018You will win there, and I will win here,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cSomething like this. \u2026 He has in his pocket \u2013 close to his heart \u2013 small pictures with us together, our family, and he said this picture is always with him. It\u2019s nice to know this.\u201d Having already qualified for the Olympics, a minor injury prevented Tkachuk from competing in Lviv, where CNN spoke to several athletes looking to secure a spot on the team. Despite Russia\u2019s invasion casting a long shadow over Ukraine\u2019s participation at these Olympics, there was a vibrant atmosphere at the event, and most athletes were excited by the chance to compete for an Olympic berth. \u201cNow, with a big team under our flag, we take part in a big Olympic movement, we take part in the biggest contest, and the entire world is looking at us,\u201d Matviy Bidnyi, Ukraine\u2019s acting sports minister, told CNN. \u201cAll of the world awaits what we will do in the Olympic Games, what we can show in the Olympic Games \u2013 that our country, which is in a condition of war now, is in a good shape.\u201d \u201cThis is a very important mission,\u201d he added, \u201cand all our athletes understand their responsibility in it.\u201d Whether Russian and Belarusian athletes should be permitted to compete at this year\u2019s Olympics, which begin on July 26, has been the topic of intense debate, especially for Ukrainian athletes and officials. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has said that Russian and Belarusians can compete as Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs) in Paris, provided that they meet certain eligibility requirements. This means that teams of Russian and Belarusian athletes will not be considered, while athletes who actively support the war against Ukraine will also be ineligible. No reference to either country will be made at the Games through the athletes\u2019 participation, such as flags, anthems or national colors. The IOC ruled that it would be unfair to punish athletes based on their passports alone, but many people in Ukraine were hoping for a more stringent stance. \u201cWe think that this position is strong enough,\u201d said Bidnyi, \u201cbut we think it would be better if they were banned totally.\u201d There will be no Russians or Belarusians taking part in track and field events in Paris as governing body World Athletics has banned athletes from these two countries from competing at an elite level \u2013 the only Olympic sports federation to have done so. This means that athletes like Tkachuk will avoid the potentially challenging situation of lining up against competitors whose nations are at war with her country, irrespective of how they are presented at the Games. \u201cThis is really nice to know, for my brother also, that I\u2019m not going to competitions to run with Russians, or to speak with Russians, or to deal with something that I don\u2019t need,\u201d she said. Her teammate, fellow 400m hurdler Anna Ryzhykova, agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re not friends, we\u2019re not competitors,\u201d Ryzhykova told CNN about facing Russian and Belarusian athletes. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a right to be at the Olympics \u2026 because every one [of them] is guilty in some way.\u201d Like Tkachuk, Ryzhykova has had to spend time away from Ukraine while she trains and competes, basing herself in the Italian city of Brescia during the summer months. But being away from her family home in Dnipro isn\u2019t always easy. \u201cHome is my safe place where I can recharge, relax, where I feel good, where I can really rest between competitions or in my training life,\u201d says the 34-year-old, a 4x400m relay bronze medalist at the 2012 London Olympics. \u201cIn the training camps, it\u2019s totally different in other countries; it\u2019s good, some countries are really amazing, but it\u2019s not my native (country). I can\u2019t relax fully there.\u201d Ryzhykova has learned not to read the news on the days she has a competition, which means finding different ways to distract herself whenever thoughts of the war enter her mind. \u201cI use books, novels or something easier,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I have bad thoughts, I\u2019m going back to this novel, and [thinking], OK, what is my character doing? I need to concentrate on this. It\u2019s my plan for competition day.\u201d CNN\u2019s Svitlana Vlasova contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/sport/ukraine-athletes-paris-olympics-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Japan\u2019s Ayaka Furue sank a dramatic, clutch putt for eagle on the final hole of the 2024 Amundi Evian Championship in France on Sunday to win by one stroke.

The Japanese star\u2019s second shot landed on the green, but she needed calm nerves to finish the task. Furue calmly rolled in the eagle to cap a six-under final round to go 19-under for the tournament \u2013 one shot better than Kyriacou who birdied the final hole.

At Pinehurst, he did not seem to enjoy a single shot and you think, \u2018What the hell is he doing?\u2019 He\u2019s coming to Troon and he won\u2019t enjoy it there either.\u201d When it was put to him that Woods has said he will retire when he feels he is no longer competitive, Montgomerie added: \u201cAren\u2019t we there? I\u2019d have thought we were past there. There is a time for all sportsmen to say goodbye, but it\u2019s very difficult to tell Tiger it\u2019s time to go. Obviously, he still feels he can win. We are more realistic. \u201cThese guys only know Tiger Woods missing the cut and he\u2019s better than that, the best we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d In his pre-tournament press conference ahead of this year\u2019s Open, which tees off Thursday, Woods took the opportunity to address Montgomerie\u2019s comments, referencing the fact that he has earned automatic qualification for the major through his past victories at the event. \u201cWell, as a past champion, I\u2019m exempt until I\u2019m 60. Colin\u2019s not,\u201d the 48-year-old Woods told reporters. \u201cHe\u2019s not a past champion, so he\u2019s not exempt. So he doesn\u2019t get the opportunity to make that decision. I do.\u201d Woods has battled with injuries and rehabilitation ever since suffering leg injuries in a serious car crash in 2021. The 15-time major winner has prioritized appearances at the four major championships in his sporadic competitive appearances in recent years. After the 2023 Masters in which Woods withdrew with injury, Montgomerie told CNN Sport\u2019s Patrick Snell that the US golfer might have missed the perfect opportunity to walk away from the sport in the previous year. \u201cIt was very difficult to see. I don\u2019t think Augusta was the course to come back on. Augusta is a mountain climb,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very physically demanding. More so than anyone would ever imagine. So to come back on that one was unfortunate. The cold, damp weather on Saturday was enough for him. It was too much. \u201cShould he have retired last year at St. Andrew\u2019s (at The Open in 2022)? The opportunity was golden. The sun was shining. The Swilcan bridge was waiting for the wave. A lot of people thought it might happen then. It possibly should have done.\u201d In the three majors in 2024, Woods has missed the cut at two \u2013 the PGA Championship and the US Open \u2013 while he finished 60th at the Masters. Woods has won The Open in 2000, 2005 and 2006. Although he has struggled physically in recent years, he said his body is \u201cfeeling better\u201d in the lead up to this year\u2019s tournament. \u201cI\u2019ve been training a lot better. We\u2019ve been busting it pretty hard in the gym, which has been good. Body\u2019s been feeling better to be able to do such things, and it translates on being able to hit the ball better,\u201d he said. \u201cCan\u2019t quite stay out there during a practice session as long as I\u2019d like, but I\u2019m able to do some things that I haven\u2019t done all year, which is nice.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/sport/tiger-woods-colin-montgomerie-retirement-golf-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_07_19_sport_chariots-of-fire-1924-paris-olympics-spt-intl", "text": "Almost everyone knows the opening sequence, film buff or not: the windswept beach, the foaming waves, the soaring, triumphant music against the sound of runners\u2019 feet patting on wet sand. So begins the 1981 Oscar-winning film \u201cChariots of Fire,\u201d introducing a group of British athletes as they train for the Olympic Games. The runners \u2013 whose t-shirts and shorts are muddied with sand and sea \u2013 splash through shallow water towards the Scottish coastal town of St Andrews, which slowly appears as a series of spires and rooftops on the horizon. The scene is embedded in cinema history, memorably capturing the quiet beauty of striding across a deserted beach. The simple joy of running will become a central theme of the film, even though the athletes\u2019 faces are now a mixture of hardship, happiness and gritty determination. \u201cWhat\u2019s beautiful about athletics as opposed to almost any other sport is its lack of complexity,\u201d David Puttnam, the producer of \u201cChariots of Fire,\u201d tells CNN Sport. \u201cYou\u2019re throwing something, you\u2019re jumping over something or you\u2019re running. It\u2019s a quintessence, really, of human effort.\u201d It\u2019s perhaps for this reason that the film, more than four decades after its release, remains as popular and relatable as ever. Based on the lives and gold-medal-winning performances of sprinters Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams ahead of the 1924 Paris Olympics, \u201cChariots of Fire\u201d won four Oscars \u2013 including Best Picture. It has been ranked among the greatest British films of all time, and was a favorite of former and current US presidents Ronald Reagan and Joe Biden. As the Olympics return to Paris this year, public viewings have been held in several countries, offering a timely reminder of how \u201cChariots of Fire\u201d still carries a charming appeal and uplifting \u2013 even life-saving \u2013 message. \u201cAfter the film came out, I must have got \u2013 and this is not an exaggeration \u2013 at least half a dozen letters from people who said that the film had made them decide not to commit suicide, that life was worth living,\u201d says Puttnam. \u201cThe film has got a way of really, really speaking to people \u2026 something much more than we envisaged or probably had been put into it. It\u2019s got a life of its own.\u201d \u201cChariots of Fire\u201d charts the athletic careers of Liddell and Abrahams \u2013 both talented sprinters \u2013 in the years leading up to the 1924 Olympics. Liddell is a kindly figure with fierce religious beliefs, a missionary in his native Scotland who withdraws from the 100 meters at the Olympics because the heats are held on a Sunday. Instead, he enters \u2013 and wins \u2013 the 400 meters, despite having limited experience of running the longer distance. This moment forms the emotional climax of \u201cChariots of Fire,\u201d as Liddell, played by Ian Charleson, describes how his running has become bound up with religion: \u201cGod made me for a purpose, but he also made me fast. And when I run, I feel his pleasure.\u201d A Scottish rugby international before he was an Olympic champion, Liddell has been celebrated for his selflessness as well as his sporting feats. He was born in China and returned there to serve as a missionary teacher after the Olympics, mostly remaining in the Asia until his death in a Japanese internment camp 20 years later. \u201cI had a lot of room in my heart for him,\u201d former Scottish sprinter Allan Wells, who won 100m gold at the 1980 Moscow Olympics, tells CNN Sport. \u201cHe\u2019s a very special person and put himself out there big-time, really. It\u2019s a huge legacy and we should remember him.\u201d Wells recalls being asked after his race in Moscow if he\u2019d like to dedicate the victory to Abrahams, Liddell\u2019s counterpart in \u201cChariots of Fire\u201d and, until then, the last British man to win 100m gold. \u201cIt was basically throwing it down my throat,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought for two or three seconds and I said, \u2018No, if I did it for anybody, I did it for Eric Liddell.\u2019 Thankfully, there were three Scottish reporters at the back of the room and they all had their thumbs up for me. \u201cI think there is an attachment, but he [Liddell] was much more special than I was \u2026 Maybe 20, 30, 40 years after I\u2019ve gone, they\u2019ll still be remembering Eric Liddell before they remember Allan Wells.\u201d Liddell\u2019s philanthropic legacy lives on through The Eric Liddell Community, a dementia care charity based in Edinburgh with a focus on the elderly, loneliness and isolation. This year, the organization has launched The Eric Liddell 100 initiative, intended to make Liddell\u2019s life better known among younger generations while recognizing his acts of heroism after Japan\u2019s invasion of China in 1931. \u201cWhen he was in China, apparently he told people to pray for the Japanese \u2013 and they were the people who were holding them in the internment camp,\u201d Sue Caton, Liddell\u2019s niece and a patron of the Eric Liddell Community, tells CNN Sport. \u201cHe thought everybody was important. He\u2019d never have dismissed anybody, no matter who they were or what they had done because he felt that\u2019s what we should do.\u201d John MacMillan, chair of the Eric Liddell Community, concurs, even noting how some people in China have embraced Liddell as their first unofficial Olympic gold medalist. \u201cHe was obviously a determined individual, he was a committed individual, and he clearly put the needs of others before his own,\u201d says MacMillan. \u201cHe\u2019s remembered as a bit of a Robin Hood figure.\u201d Abrahams makes a striking counterpoint to Liddell in \u201cChariots of Fire,\u201d his conviction and strength of personality no less forceful. The film also presents Abrahams\u2019 faith as a motivating factor in his running career. Antisemitism forms the backdrop of his time as a Cambridge student and his athletic ability is described as \u201ca weapon \u2026 against being Jewish.\u201d \u201cI attached so much importance to my athletics as a means of demonstrating that I wasn\u2019t inferior,\u201d Abrahams, who died three years before the release of the film, once said in an interview with the BBC in the 1960s. \u201cThis played a very big part in my life. I think one exaggerates it \u2013 there was a certain amount of antisemitism when I was a young man, there\u2019s a certain amount now. But I was so bent on demonstrating my superiority that I banked everything on athletics.\u201d Running, for Abrahams, was all-consuming, so much so that he frequently became anxious and obsessive about his performances \u2013 a detail captured by actor Ben Cross in \u201cChariots of Fire.\u201d He tells coach Sam Mussabini on the eve of the Olympic 100m final: \u201cI\u2019ve known the fear of losing, and now I\u2019m almost too frightened to win.\u201d Abrahams\u2019 nervous, uneasy relationship with racing was almost self-destructive. \u201cHarold Abrahams was an extremely neurotic man, and to say he was highly strung is almost an understatement,\u201d author Mark Ryan, whose book \u201cChariots Return\u201d charts the lives and influence of Liddell and Abrahams, tells CNN Sport. \u201cHe went through absolute hell before races, borderline full-on nervous breakdowns. The fear was expectation, that people had come there to see him win, but they would also laugh if he lost.\u201d Liddell\u2019s early-career nerves, on the other hand, disappeared over time. \u201cHe quickly got over that when he realized that he could connect his running to his Christianity in his mind,\u201d adds Ryan, \u201cand then just all the pressure fell away. He still hated losing, but if it was God\u2019s will that he didn\u2019t win, he didn\u2019t win. It was all for the glory of God, and what will be will be. That was a wonderful mindset to take into any race, I think.\u201d Abrahams badly injured his leg doing the long jump the year after the Paris Olympics, forcing him to retire from athletics. He went on to become an influential journalist, broadcaster and athletics administrator, and he remains one of only three British men to win the Olympic 100m title. \u201cChariots of Fire\u201d has prevented the achievements of Liddell and Abrahams from being lost in time, but the film is not a precise portrayal of their lives. Liddell, for instance, decided not to run the 100m long before the Games, unlike the 11th-hour decision presented in the film. His bronze medal in the 200 meters is also passed over, while the athletes\u2019 training in the opening scene happened not in St Andrews but Broadstairs, a town in the south of England. Puttnam, who has acknowledged the film\u2019s artistic license, says that he never foresaw its success, not least because of the budget constraints \u2013 he had $6 million at his disposal \u2013 and many logistical hurdles. When it came to the Oscars, he was indifferent about attending and never expected that he\u2019d walk on the stage to collect the award for Best Picture. \u201cI remember getting up, my knees going all wobbly and going down [to the stage],\u201d he says. \u201cI hadn\u2019t had my hair cut \u2013 it\u2019s this shot of me trying to push my hair into some sort order because if I thought I was going to win, I probably would have got my hair cut.\u201d The filming of \u201cChariots of Fire,\u201d much like preparing for the Olympics, was an arduous process. The actors trained for six weeks under veteran Olympic coach Tom McNab just to be in shape to film the running scenes, while Nigel Havers \u2013 who plays Lord Andrew Lindsey \u2013 fell and broke his wrist while learning to hurdle. \u201cIf you ever meet him, his wrist is on the wonk,\u201d says Puttnam. \u201cHe knew if he went to a doctor, we\u2019d have to recast the film, so he didn\u2019t tell anyone \u2026 I\u2019ve always been in awe of his courage.\u201d Courage, fittingly, is central to \u201cChariots of Fire\u201d \u2013 be it Liddell\u2019s decision not to bow to the pressure of running on a Sunday or Abrahams\u2019 conquering of his pre-race nerves ahead of the 100m final. And while the film is about devotion, commitment and an unbridled love of running, it is also, somewhat cynically, about winning. \u201cWould I have done it if Liddell won a silver medal? The answer\u2019s no, I wouldn\u2019t,\u201d muses Puttnam. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the point.\u201d History, so the saying goes, is written by the victors \u2013 and that seems an apt message for one of the most iconic sports films ever made.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/sport/chariots-of-fire-1924-paris-olympics-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Six-time PGA Tour winner Bradley was controversially snubbed by Zach Johnson for last year\u2019s beaten team in Rome and will be tasked with avenging that bruising loss to Europe at the 45th edition of the biennial competition at Bethpage Black in Farmingdale, New York. The world No. 19 \u2013 who made two appearances as a player at the Ryder Cup in 2012 and 2014 \u2013 will be 39-years-old come September next year, making the Vermont native the youngest captain to lead a team at the tournament since Arnold Palmer in 1963. \u201cI am incredibly honored to accept this opportunity to Captain the United States Team at the 2025 Ryder Cup,\u201d 2011 PGA Championship victor Bradley said in a statement to the PGA of America, who decide the captaincy, on Monday. \u201cMy passion and appreciation for golf\u2019s greatest team event have never been stronger. The Ryder Cup is unlike any other competition in our sport, and this edition will undoubtedly be particularly special given the rich history and enthusiastic spectators at this iconic course. I look forward to beginning preparations for 2025.\u201d Woods\u2019 name had been frequently linked with the position in the fallout of last year\u2019s defeat, with the 48-year-old telling reporters at May\u2019s PGA Championship that he was in discussions with the PGA of America over taking on the role. An eight-time Ryder Cup player and victorious Playing Captain at the 2019 Presidents Cup, Woods had cautioned that he was \u201cdedicating so much time\u201d to his involvement in peace talks between the PGA Tour and LIV Golf, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t want to not fulfill the role of the captaincy if I can\u2019t do it.\u201d Woods had been ready to accept the role if captaincy commitments were reduced in the lead up to the tournament, according to The Telegraph, who reported that the 15-time major winner had turned down the position hours before Bradley\u2019s announcement by PGA of America President John Lindert. \u201cI am proud and excited to name Keegan Bradley as Captain of the 2025 United States Ryder Cup Team,\u201d said Lindert. \u201cKeegan\u2019s past Ryder Cup experience, strong relationships and unwavering passion for this event will prove invaluable as he guides the U.S. Team over the next year and a half. We are confident that with Keegan at the helm, the 2025 U.S. Ryder Cup Team will compete at Bethpage with the same confidence and determination that has defined his career.\u201d Redemption calling It will be a chance to heal old wounds on a number of levels for US Captain and Co. in New York. Bradley was one of several players who may have felt aggrieved to be left at home for Rome in early Fall 2023, given he had accumulated more qualification points than captain\u2019s pick Justin Thomas, who had struggled for his best form all season. Johnson ultimately came under heavy fire for his leadership decisions at Marco Simone Golf Club. A final day resurgence saw the scoreboard end read a more respectable 16.5 \u2013 11.5, but Europe dismantled the visitors across the first two days to extend Team USA\u2019s 30-year winless drought away from home. Despite a positive 4-3-0 record at Ryder Cups as a player, Bradley has never tasted victory at the event. Three points on his debut in Illinois in 2012 was a joint team-high yet could not prevent \u201cThe Miracle of Medinah,\u201d as Team Europe mounted a remarkable final day charge to complete one of sport\u2019s most famous comebacks. Two years later, Bradley was a member of Tom Watson\u2019s team that fell to Paul McGinley\u2019s European side at Gleneagles Hotel in Scotland. Luke Donald will retain his role as European captain for Bethpage, making him the first repeat leader of the team since Bernard Gallacher manned the helm in three consecutive tournaments between 1991 and 1995. \u201cGreat opportunities don\u2019t come along very often in life and I\u2019m a great believer that when they do, you need to grab them with both hands. This is one of these moments,\u201d Donald said following his appointment in November. The Englishman proved a hugely popular chief in Rome, but will be up against the weight of history in two years\u2019 time. Europe has not won on American soil since that famous victory in 2012 and were routed 19 \u2013 9, the biggest winning margin in Ryder Cup history, at Whistling Straights in 2021.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/sport/keegan-bradley-ryder-cup-captain-2025-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Once upon a time, an internal monologue of insecurity \u2013 \u2018Man, I\u2019m stinking today\u2019 \u2013 would have been the soundtrack to the American\u2019s march past the masses. These days, though, it\u2019s an entirely different voice \u2013 one that leads him to pause at the ropes and make the day of one enraptured young fan. \u201cI throw a few more golf balls out than I ever have \u2026 Not only does it make them happy, but it makes me happy,\u201d Spieth told CNN Sport\u2019s Patrick Snell. \u201cIt\u2019s cool to see a kid smile. I\u2019m like, \u2018Man, if my son was out here, he wouldn\u2019t care what that guy did on the previous hole or tournament. He just knows who he is for whatever reason and he wants a high five.\u2019\u201d Make no mistake, Spieth is as hungry as ever to continue populating his trophy cabinet, but fatherhood and Father Time have recalibrated the three-time major champion\u2019s outlook. At 30 years old, Spieth is far from a veteran. Yet 11 years, 276 events and 13 wins into his PGA Tour career, the former world No. 1 already experienced and witnessed more than many golfers will in a lifetime. Sporting immortality still beckons, with Spieth just one PGA Championship victory away from becoming only the sixth player in history to clinch all four professional majors, but the Texan is eyeing a legacy that can be measured in more than just silverware. \u201cYou start to realize that the trophies and all that, it\u2019s great and it happens, but they are a blip in time,\u201d he said. \u201cThat you can make somebody feel good, how you make somebody feel, is significantly more important than how you entertain them once. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to lose perspective when you\u2019re in the middle of competition, but the more [you play], you can recognize it\u2019s just a game and the impact we have can be way more important than that entertainment when we pass by on that one hole.\u201d Back to the start Spieth\u2019s latest effort to deliver such an impact takes the form of the \u201cCrush It! Cup\u201d \u2013 a youth golf tournament and fundraiser staged at the place where his journey began. On September 16, Brookhaven Country Club in Dallas will play host to a competition of 36 junior golfers who will have earned their place on the field based on their efforts in a two-month long Golf Marathon Fundraiser. The campaign will run across 26 states at 150 golf clubs owned by Invited, the largest owner and operator of private membership clubs in the US that partnered with Spieth in 2022. Spieth will host a golf clinic for the top 100 fundraisers before playing alongside each young golfer for one hole at Brookhaven \u2013 coincidentally both his and Invited\u2019s first club. As the sun sets, he will take a seat beside the flames to anchor a Fireside chat with competitors. The host is expecting some \u201ccrazy\u201d questions, many stemming from Netflix\u2019s fly-on-the-wall golf docuseries \u201cFull Swing,\u201d but is just as interested in what he can take from those asking them. \u201cThese kids, you watch them \u2013 their focus, their desire \u2013 they\u2019re so nice and then the second it\u2019s their turn to hit, they \u2013 the competitive nature sinks in,\u201d Spieth said. \u201cI\u2019m really excited to just watch kids be kids. We just kind of lose sight of it professionally sometimes. We get involved in more of the business and technical sides of things and it\u2019s really fun to just be around a bunch of kids playing golf. \u201cIt reminds us why we love the game and we should never forget that.\u201d Money raised will head to the Jordan Spieth Family Foundation, which was built to raise awareness of and fund four key \u201cpillars\u201d: junior golf, military veterans, pediatric cancer and children with special needs. Spieth launched the endeavor as a 19-year-old rookie in large part due to his younger sister Ellie, who has autism. More than a decade on, his sibling continues to inspire. \u201cIt\u2019s a love, a support, a perspective that a lot of other people don\u2019t necessarily have,\u201d Spieth said. \u201cI\u2019ve always said that we\u2019re blessed because we get to watch her. It\u2019s raw emotion and her joy is just pure joy \u2013 there\u2019s no faking. It\u2019s fun to watch her be and it\u2019s fun to support her as she\u2019s always been there to support us.\u201d \u2018He\u2019s doing more for the game of golf than any professional golfer is doing\u2019 While Spieth is confident that junior golf is becoming increasingly diverse, he believes \u201cquite a bit\u201d of work is still left to be done at the grassroots level of the sport in terms of inclusivity. Poetically, the biggest driver for change may lie outside the traditional channels. While Spieth is pleased with the efforts his foundation is making \u2013 such as supporting the PGA Junior League, First Tee and other nonprofits \u2013 he is left awestruck by the influence of NBA icon Steph Curry. An avid \u2013 and rather talented \u2013 golfer himself, Golden State Warriors star Curry launched his \u201cUnderrated Golf Tour\u201d in 2022, offering an all-expenses paid competitive opportunity for underrepresented young players. Ahead of last month\u2019s US Open, the four-time NBA champion was presented with the Charlie Sifford Award, a prize \u2013 named after the PGA Tour\u2019s first Black player \u2013 bestowed by the World Golf Hall of Fame that honors those advancing diversity in golf. For Spieth, there could not have been a more worthy recipient. \u201cHe\u2019s doing more for the game of golf than any professional golfer is doing,\u201d Spieth insists.\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely remarkable.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re trying to help where we can, but some people like Steph have bigger platforms and it\u2019s really cool with the stuff he\u2019s doing. As much as we try to help, he\u2019s got the opportunity and he\u2019s acting on it tenfold.\u201d As the major season culminates with the Open Championship in Scotland on July 18, Spieth\u2019s sights are firmly trained on more major glory. Yet should the 2017 champion not get his hands on a second Claret Jug, he will take some comfort if he hears one of his favorite soundbites from beyond the ropes at Royal Troon. \u201cKids coming up and saying, \u2018I didn\u2019t play the game of golf \u2018til I watched you and then I wanted to take it up.\u2019 It\u2019s really neat when you hear that,\u201d Spieth said. \u201cBecause I love the game, and I know that the game is a really good pathway into creating good human beings going forward. \u201cI never really got into it for that. I just loved it myself and I loved competing and so I just wanted to keep doing it. You don\u2019t really realize until later on that, if you do it the right way, it can have that kind of impact and bring somebody else into the game.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/sport/jordan-spieth-crush-it-cup-golf-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Pittsburgh Pirates rookie sensation Paul Skenes started the game for the National League, becoming the first\u00a0rookie pitcher to start in an All-Star game\u00a0in nearly 30 years. He pitched a scoreless first inning, allowing one batter to reach on a walk and inducing a groundout from MLB home run leader Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees to end the inning. Japanese superstar Shohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Dodgers got the scoring started in the third inning with a three-run homer off Boston Red Sox pitcher Tanner Houck to give the NL a 3-0 lead. But the American League answered right back with a two-run double from the Yankees\u2019 Juan Soto and an RBI single from the Cleveland Guardians\u2019 David Fry to tie the game 3-3 after three innings. The American League took a 5-3 lead in the fifth inning with a two-run blast from Red Sox outfielder Jarren Duran off Cincinnati Reds pitcher Hunter Greene. The National League couldn\u2019t muster an answer, and Cleveland\u2019s Emmanuel Clase closed the door in the ninth inning to earn the save. Oakland Athletics fireballer Mason Miller picked up the win for the AL behind a perfect fifth inning that included strikeouts of Ohtani and Philadelphia Phillies shortstop Trea Turner. Duran\u2019s game-winning big fly earned him MVP honors, putting the outfielder in stellar company with baseball legends. According to MLB, Duran said postgame: \u201cI didn\u2019t think about that. That\u2019s a great list of names to be a part of. I think I\u2019m just thankful to be able to play in the All-Star Game and for the Red Sox, and to represent them well. It\u2019s just \u2013 I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s a surreal moment. So I\u2019m just thankful to be here. \u201cI\u2019m definitely not thinking I\u2019m the best of the best. I\u2019m a guy that keeps my head down and just works hard. There\u2019s so many good players in this league. I\u2019m just thankful that I can play against these guys. \u201cI\u2019m just very thankful. It\u2019s hard to put into words. It won\u2019t hit me until I try to go to sleep tonight.

{"id": "2023_10_30_sport_enhanced-games-olympics-doping-spt-intl", "text": "The 2024 Olympics are fast approaching and as athletes gear up for one of the world\u2019s most prestigious sporting events, one entrepreneur has a different idea of what \u201cfaster, higher, stronger\u201d \u2013 the former motto of the Games \u2013 might represent. The Enhanced Games says it is an \u201calternative\u201d to what it calls the \u201ccorrupt Olympics Games.\u201d Athletes competing at the Enhanced Games will be free to use performance-enhancing drugs, they won\u2019t be tested and will be under no obligation to declare which substances they have taken in order to compete. That\u2019s quite a contrast to the Olympics\u2019 doping protocols. The International Testing Agency (ITA) will be responsible for looking after Paris 2024\u2019s anti-doping program. Six years ago, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which oversees the Olympics, delegated its entire clean sport program to the ITA. However, historically the Olympic Games have been dogged by a series of doping and kickback scandals. When approached for comment on the Enhanced Games and allegations of corruption, the IOC told CNN Sport that \u201cthe idea does not merit any comment.\u201d \u2018Danger to health, to sport\u2019 CNN Sport interviewed a number of experts in the field of doping for this story, who expressed concern that the Enhanced Games was an extremely dangerous proposition. Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, who exposed Russia\u2019s state-sponsored doping program \u2013 a massive, years-long effort which benefited more than 1,000 athletes between 2011 and 2015 \u2013 said that the Enhanced Games is a \u201cdanger to health, to sport.\u201d Whether the Enhanced Games will ever take place remains an open question, but the very idea is drawing considerable blowback from leading anti-doping officials and sporting organizations. The Enhanced Games is the brainchild of businessman Aron D\u2019Souza. He is also the founding editor of \u201cThe Journal Jurisprudence,\u201d a quarterly publication on legal philosophy, according to his website, which also describes him as an \u201cavid athlete.\u201d Recently, D\u2019Souza told CNN Sport he has \u201csigned term sheets with prominent venture capital firms\u201d in relation to the Enhanced Games and is \u201cwaiting on the lawyers to finish long-form drafting.\u201d He also said that a funding announcement is planned for early December. Although not legally binding, term sheets are a serious expression of intent by both sides, setting out the broad principles of an agreement. D\u2019Souza believes what he calls a \u201cscience-driven\u201d competition is the next step in the evolution of sport, suggesting that the absence of drug testing will level the playing field. According to a 2020 study from Raphael Faiss, Research Manager at the centre of Research and Expertise in anti-doping sciences at the University of Lausanne, data from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) suggests less than 2% of athletes dope. However, Faiss told CNN Sport the number of athletes taking performance-enhancing drugs is likely significantly higher; his research, based on two international major athletic events in 2011 and 2013, suggests the figure could be between 15 to 18%. Faiss and his team compared athletes\u2019 blood results collected by WADA-accredited labs to values from healthy adults, as well as doped and undoped athletes; the closer the values are to those of subjects to whom erythropoietin (EPO, which is used in blood doping) had been administered, the higher the chances that they\u2019re actually doping. This analysis, Faiss said, is not proof of doping, but is a \u201crobust way\u201d of analyzing the data, allowing scientists to make an estimate for doping prevalence, as well as targeting athletes most likely to be doping. In written comments to CNN Sport, WADA said: \u201cDetermining the level of [doping] prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed,\u201d explaining that, since 2017, a \u201cprevalence working group\u201d has been established to \u201cdetermine if strategies, reliable methods and tools can be developed to adequately assess the prevalence of doping in sports.\u201d WADA told CNN Sport that the group has delivered \u201cseveral recommendations and guidance to WADA but not the final ones yet.\u201d WADA has reservations about Faiss\u2019 study and pointed to the \u201ccomplexity of trying to measure [doping] prevalence,\u201d highlighting that reports have \u201cgreatly varying results.\u201d The anti-doping organization added: \u201cNo single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline.\u201d \u201cComparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system\u2019s testing figures isn\u2019t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence. \u201cIn any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries \u2013 it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others. \u201cThe Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures.\u201d Editor\u2019s note: You can find WADA\u2019s full statement at the bottom of this article.\u00a0 \u2018A dangerous clown show\u2019 Travis Tygart, the Chief Executive Officer at the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), told CNN Sport that the idea of an Enhanced Games is \u201cfarcical \u2026 likely illegal in many [US] states\u201d and \u201ca dangerous clown show, not real sport.\u201d Substances such as anabolic steroids \u2013 which help to build muscle mass by enabling athletes to train harder and recover quickly from strenuous workouts \u2013 are classified as a Schedule III drug by the US Drug Enforcement Administration. When asked whether anabolic steroids will be allowed at the games and whether athletes would be tested for illegal drugs such as cocaine, D\u2019Souza told CNN Sport that \u201cwe will not be drug testing at the games.\u201d He added: \u201cWe do not propose to regulate what athletes use.\u201d Anabolic steroids may be prescribed by a licensed physician for the treatment of certain conditions such as testosterone deficiency, but if used in the US without a prescription from a licensed physician, a first conviction could result in a one-year prison sentence and a $1,000 fine. But that isn\u2019t the only potential legal jeopardy the Enhanced Games faces, according to American lawyer Jim Walden, who represents Russian whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov. \u201cIf you look at the Enhanced Games website, it\u2019s almost as though they\u2019re advertising their disregard of the law,\u201d Walden told CNN Sport. \u201cThey wrap themselves up in what I will call the cloak of legitimacy by using phrases like body autonomy and coming out as an enhanced athlete. \u201cI hope they\u2019re thinking hard about how they\u2019re going to pull this off in the world in which the FBI has a specific unit that is called the Sports and Gaming Initiative that\u2019s focusing on these very issues.\u201d The Sports and Gaming Initiative was developed to \u201cprotect athletes and sporting institutions in the United States from criminal threats and influences,\u201d according to the government website. The initiative works in partnership with sports leagues and governing bodies, international law enforcement and independent watchdog groups to tackle crimes such as fraud, doping and match-fixing; criminal activities, it says, \u201cdegrade the integrity of sports and competition and erode public confidence in these cherished institutions.\u201d \u201cThe use of doping substances is not acceptable in modern sports,\u201d Rodchenkov said in his written comments to CNN. \u201cPromotion and advertising of banned substances is against sport rules and moral, letter and spirit. \u201cIt might bring an extreme harm to young generation[s] of athletes who mistakenly could believe in benefits of [the] Enhanced Games.\u201d Rodchenkov, the protagonist of the Oscar-winning Netflix documentary Icarus who is currently under FBI protection, also believes that the Enhanced Games\u2019 organizers \u201cmight get investigated [\u2026] under the Rodchenkov Act.\u201d The Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act, named after the whistleblower, allows the US to impose criminal sanctions on individuals involved in doping activities at international events. However, the Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act does not apply to sporting events that don\u2019t adopt the WADA code, which the Enhanced Games wouldn\u2019t do. Rodchenkov also added that WADA athletes could not have any affiliation or contact with so-called enhanced athletes, or they would risk being charged under Article 2.10 \u2013 \u201cProhibited Association by an Athlete or Other Person\u201d \u2013 of the World Anti-Doping Code. USADA\u2019s Tygart also told CNN Sport: \u201cNo one really wants our children growing up idolizing unbridled drug use in sport, even if some profiteers think otherwise.\u201d D\u2019Souza insists his motivation for founding the Enhanced Games isn\u2019t financial. If he had wanted to make more money, he says he\u2019d continue to be a \u201cquiet, mild-mannered venture capitalist.\u201d \u201cI do think fundamentally that consumers want this [the Enhanced Games] and athletes want this because if you go to the cinemas, no one\u2019s interested in histories in the past anymore,\u201d said D\u2019Souza. \u201cThey\u2019re interested in superheroes and technology in the future. And this is literally what we are bringing to a reality.\u201d \u2018The dirtiest Olympics in history\u2019 According to Pierre de Coubertin \u2013 the founder of the modern Olympics \u2013 \u201cfor every man, woman and child, it [sport] offers an opportunity for self-improvement.\u201d Except historically, many athletes competing in the Olympics have taken the idea of self-improvement too far, notably at London 2012, which Rodchenkov has previously called \u201cthe dirtiest Olympics in history.\u201d When the ITA concluded its re-analysis program for the London Games, it found 73 anti-doping rule violations, which led to the withdrawal of 31 medals and reallocation of 46 Olympic medals across the sports of athletics, weightlifting, wrestling and canoeing. Doping has been an issue at the Olympics throughout the event\u2019s history, and the 100-meter final at the 1988 Games has become one of the most infamous and controversial moments in sporting history. Six of the eight finalists \u2013 notably the winner, Ben Johnson \u2013 who lined up on that September day in Seoul 35 years ago would fail drug tests themselves or be implicated in drug use during their careers. Despite some athletes continuing to cheat, global antidoping efforts remain ever-present, according to the testers. Recent out-of-competition (OOC) testing data published by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) highlights positive results from steps being taken to keep \u201celite podiums and finals clean,\u201d according to the anti-doping organization. Data focused on OOC testing ahead of last year\u2019s World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon, shows how resources and testing are targeting those athletes most likely to win medals and make finals. Whilst only 39% of the athletes in Eugene had three or more OOC tests in the 10 months leading up the event, 81% of top-eight finishers had three or more OOC tests. Yet the cat and mouse game between testers and athletes using banned substances continues. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly about the question of timing and targeting the right athletes,\u201d said Faiss. Given that athletes have their blood values regularly monitored, it is \u201cgetting more difficult for athletes to use high doses [of drugs such as EPO], but they would still be using micro dosing.\u201d By taking EPO late at night and drinking enough water, the substance would not be detected in athletes the following morning, according to Faiss, though athletes suspected of blood doping could be tested in the middle of the night. \u201cAthletes are actually getting back to very simple ways of doping with steroids,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cEPO is quite simple to use, but still tricky to detect.\u201d Athletes \u201cuse the drugs that are actively working.\u201d When it comes to new substances such as Roxadustat \u2013 the drug that two-time grand slam champion Simona Halep has recently been given a four-year ban for taking, although she denies ever knowingly or intentionally taking any prohibited substance \u2013 Faiss said athletes \u201care likely to use substances with a very short half-life in [the] body that are mimicking processes of the oxygen carrying improvements through the EPO channels.\u201d Roxadustat has an elimination half-life of 10-16 hours, according to the National Institutes of Health. Athletes are \u201cseeking to find substances where the [half-life] time window is very short, to make sure that if they are not tested at the right moment, they won\u2019t be caught,\u201d said Faiss. \u2018Challenge for sporting competition\u2019 Michele Verroken, the founding director of consultancy group Sporting Integrity, believes an antidoping system is required that will \u201cgive a lot more credibility, a lot more immediacy to verifying results, if we\u2019re going to keep the hearts and minds of athletes.\u201d Verroken also questions what\u2019s stopping an athlete from cheating if they only get caught 10 years after the event, or not at all. Under the World Anti-Doping Code, there is a 10-year statute of limitations on samples taken from 2015 onwards. Verroken told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games is \u201csetting a really interesting challenge for sporting competition.\u201d Not unsurprisingly, many sporting bodies have condemned the event. The Australian Olympic Committee called it \u201cdangerous and irresponsible,\u201d saying that \u201cthe world needs better than this.\u201d UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) said it \u201cis extremely concerned by the concept of an Enhanced Games,\u201d adding that \u201cthere is no place in sport for performance enhancing drugs, nor the Enhanced Games.\u201d UKAD\u2019s Director of Operations, Hamish Coffey, told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games sets a \u201chugely dangerous precedent,\u201d expressing concern over the kind of messaging the event sends to the next generation of athletes. \u2018Very accomplished athletes\u2019 When CNN Sport spoke to D\u2019Souza shortly after the proposed event\u2019s announcement, he said that 368 athletes had enquired about the Enhanced Games and more had messaged via social media. The organization\u2019s Chief Athletes Officer and former Olympian Brett Fraser, who swam for the Cayman Islands at three Olympic Games, told CNN Sport that \u201cvery accomplished athletes\u201d at the level of Olympic finalists have reached out \u201cto understand more about how the first Games will take place and how they can become involved.\u201d Fraser added that Enhanced Games organizers \u201calready have an Olympic medallist\u201d for their athlete commission, though he didn\u2019t specify who that was. He also said there has been \u201ca lot of positive feedback and a lot of acceptance and excitement from younger generations.\u201d Nonetheless, none of the athletes appear prepared to speak publicly at this stage. For those who do want to compete, the Enhanced Games would be an annual event with five categories \u2013 track and field, swimming, weightlifting, gymnastics and martial arts. The huge cost of hosting an Olympic Games is no secret, with countries often striving to create bigger and better spectacles by blowing their budget. Tokyo 2021 had the largest Olympic sports program in history, with 33 sports competitions in 42 venues culminating in 339 medal events. The Covid-impacted Games were delivered with a final expenditure of $13 billion \u2013 almost double the $7.3 billion that was originally forecast. Meanwhile, keeping the IOC\u2019s philosophy of \u201clower-impact Games\u201d in mind, 95% of venues will be pre-existing facilities at the Paris 2024 Olympics. D\u2019Souza said the Enhanced Games will focus on fewer sports, reuse existing infrastructure and fund the event through the private sector to \u201cdeliver a high-impact yet cost-efficient games\u201d so profits can be shared with the athletes. He added that the Enhanced Games is looking for a seven-figure prize pool for any athlete potentially breaking Usain Bolt\u2019s 100-meter world record of 9.58 seconds. \u201cI\u2019ve had conversations with people who are top-10 sprinters in the world who are going to the next Olympics, and they said [\u2026] if there\u2019s a million-dollar prize to break the 100m world record, I\u2019ll be there,\u201d said D\u2019Souza. Universal basic income and mental health support to athletes will also be part of an \u201cenhanced athletes programme.\u201d When asked who would take responsibility if an athlete competing at the Enhanced Games were to suffer fatal consequences, D\u2019Souza told CNN Sport that \u201cour athletes at the games will be the most monitored athletes in history.\u201d He said: \u201cWe will focus on athlete safety by mandating athletes have pre-competition full-system clinical screenings including blood tests and EKGs.\u201d \u201cThis will ensure that athletes are healthy to complete and not at risk of major health complications.\u201d D\u2019Souza also said that athletes will sign waivers in order\u00a0to compete. As it stands, no venues are officially in place to host the event and D\u2019Souza admits its scale will be dependent on funding and media partnerships. \u201cWe\u2019re in commercial negotiations with venues and media partners at the moment,\u201d added D\u2019Souza, who said the first Enhanced Games will be at a university campus or a similar facility in the south of the US and that a number of trademarks have been filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. \u2018Undermine the very purpose of sport\u2019 Elite performance coach Trevor Painter, who has worked with a number of Olympic and international sprinters and middle-distance runners, said he would \u201cnever\u201d coach an athlete taking performance-enhancing drugs because it would go against his morals as a coach. \u201cHaving been involved with many athletes that have lost in many ways to the cheats, I won\u2019t be engaging with [the Enhanced Games],\u201d Painter told CNN Sport. If it goes ahead as planned in December 2024, D\u2019Souza insists that the Enhanced Games will unlock the potential of humanity. But according to John William Devine, Senior Lecturer in Ethics, Sport and Exercise Sciences at Swansea University in Wales, the Enhanced Games will make sporting competition more unfair than it already is and even \u201cundermine the very purpose of the sport in question.\u201d Devine told CNN Sport that \u201cperformance-enhancing drugs don\u2019t actually lead to better athletic performance. They obscure athletic performance.\u201d He added that, although the Enhanced Games may look very similar to the Olympics, the nature of the activity will be different, raising the question: \u201cTo what extent is drug-assisted performance reflective of the athletes\u2019 sporting excellence?\u201d WADA response in full: Determining the level of prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed. That is why we set up a\u00a0Working Group on Doping Prevalence\u00a0in 2017. Measuring doping prevalence is a difficult and complex process. Through its work, the group found a huge variance across the many prevalence studies that have been carried out, leading it to publish guidelines on how to improve the quality of measuring prevalence. WADA is currently developing a tool that Anti-Doping Organizations can use to evaluate the effectiveness of their programs. WADA is well aware of the [Faiss] study. Indeed, one of the contributors, Prof. Martial Saugy, is a member of the Working Group. This study is one of many that helps to inform the Group\u2019s work. It is a very narrow study. It looks at two events, in a single sport, held 10 and 12 years ago, using just one method of measurement (the Athlete Biological Passport (ABP)). As far as I am aware, there is no comparable data from more recent World Championships in the same sport. Given its limited scope, it is important that this study be analyzed within the wider context of other studies and not be taken in isolation. This study also highlights the complexity of trying to measure prevalence. It is the third published paper that sought to measure prevalence at the 2011 Athletics World Championships. Each reported greatly varying results. The fact is no single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline. Results will always come with caveats and margins of error and will be based on a variety of methods, including self-report questionnaires, analytical methods (like ABP and testing data) and other methods to give a more rounded estimate of what the most likely figure would be. Comparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system\u2019s testing figures isn\u2019t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence. In any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries \u2013 it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others. The Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/10/30/sport/enhanced-games-olympics-doping-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Even though swimming is a joyful experience for Dale, the stark reality is that many Black communities in Britain and the US do not have safe access to swimming lessons and public pools due to historic racism and segregation \u2013 a problem that is especially alarming given that, as Dale says, it is \u201cthe only sport that can save your life.\u201d  A history of exclusion The lack of access afforded to Black communities in Britain is what motivated Dale to become a swimming teacher in September 2019.  \u201cI used to work in Kensington (in London) as a lifeguard and some of the richest people live in that borough, but also some of the poorest,\u201d she says. She saw there was a difference when private schools and independent schools would come in and all the kids were able to swim, yet hardly any children of the same age that Dale saw from state schools could swim 25 meters.  \u201cThere\u2019s a real class barrier in the sport of swimming,\u201d Dale adds.

It was born in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster in 2017, when a residential block caught on fire, killing 72 people \u2013 and leaving many more without homes.   \u201cThere\u2019s like a lot of people who come to swim lessons \u2026 who have undergone some form of trauma, whether that be water-related trauma or trauma related to their everyday lives,\u201d Dale says.   \u201cMany people say it\u2019s like an escape from their daily lives or is, actually, the first time that they\u2019ve taken time for themselves.\u201d  While 77% of children from the most affluent families in England can swim 25 meters unaided, only 34% from the least affluent families can, according to a 2021 survey from Sport England, a non-departmental public body that fosters grassroots sports in England.  About 95% of Black adults and 80% of Black children in England do not regularly participate in swimming, according to Sport England\u2019s report, published in January 2020. Likewise, about 93% of Asian adults and 78% of Asian children, including those with Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi heritage, do not regularly participate in swimming, the same research found. This trend extends to the US, where nearly 64% of Black children have \u201clow\u201d or no ability to swim, compared with 40% of their White peers, according to 2017 data from the country\u2019s national governing body for the sport at a competitive level, USA Swimming.   The underrepresentation of Black people in the pool in the US can be traced back to the early 20th century.   Public swimming pools became popular in North America in the 1920s and 30s and were initially open to all. However, Northern politicians stipulated a \u201cWhites Only\u201d rule, referencing racist fears about Black men fraternizing with White women.   Even after legal racial segregation ended in the US in 1964, public pools continued to be hostile environments. As people of color began to use public pools, White swimmers retreated to the privacy of their own pools and private clubs, where expensive fees continue to be an economic barrier for Black families who cannot afford the cost.    Similar examples in Britain illustrate how racial and class inequalities lead to the systemic exclusion of Black people in pools. For example, more than 4.2 million people in the UK live in ethnically diverse communities where Covid-19 national lockdowns resulted in the closure or mothballing of pools, according to Swim England \u2013 England\u2019s national swimming governing body \u2013 and the Black Swimming Association (BSA), a UK-based charity that aims to encourage more African, Caribbean and Asian communities to take up swimming.  \u2018We cannot keep recovering bodies\u2019  Globally, drowning is the third leading cause of accidental injury-related death and at least 236,000 people die each year from drowning, according to 2019 data from the World Health Organization (WHO). Children are particularly affected, with drowning being one of the top five causes of death for those aged 1-14 years in 48 of 85 countries studied by the WHO.   And while natural disasters and irregular migration are notorious risk factors, so are lower socioeconomic status, lack of higher education and being a member of an ethnic minority, depending on the country, WHO research shows.  \u201cMost drowning incidents happen when people never intend to get into the water in the first place,\u201d says Dale, who was awarded Swim Teacher of the Year by Swim England in 2021.  In December 2019, three members of the same Black British family \u2013 a 53-year-old father and his two children \u2013 died in a swimming pool at a resort in Costa del Sol, Spain, Reuters reported. The father and his 16-year-old son had reportedly leapt into the water to try to save his nine-year-old daughter, who was drowning.   Danielle Obe is the co-founder and chair of the BSA. She told CNN Sport that the Costa del Sol deaths prompted her to establish the BSA in March 2020, alongside Olympic swimmer Alice Dearing, journalist Seren Jones and songwriter, rapper and producer Ed Accura.    \u201cThis was devastating because these families were actually acquainted to me and they were from my local community,\u201d Obe says. \u201c(At) that point, I called Alice and Seren, and I said, \u2018We\u2019ve been talking about doing something for our community. We\u2019ve got to do something. We\u2019ve got to do it now. We cannot keep recovering bodies.\u2019\u201d   \u201cIt\u2019s no longer just about that lack of representation,\u201d Obe adds.   \u201cIt\u2019s now about saving lives, vital water safety, education for all. Swimming is an intervention. Swimming is a life skill.\u201d  However, there is still a lack of data when it comes to drowning-related deaths by ethnicity in the UK, says Obe.  \u201cAt the moment, we don\u2019t know how much of a disparity there is between drowning and fatalities, aquatic fatalities for different communities in the UK because, up until now, drowning data isn\u2019t really captured by ethnicity, which is another point, another issue that the BSA is looking to tackle.\u201d \u2018People just don\u2019t think Black people should swim\u2019  Dearing, the first Black female swimmer to represent Britain at the Olympics when she competed at Tokyo 2020, \u201cimplores\u201d people to learn to swim.   \u201cI have been quite torn between the amazing achievement of being the first Black woman to represent GB in swimming but wanting to be my own person, my own athlete, who\u2019s known for being an athlete and not for her race and her sport combined together,\u201d she tells CNN Sport. \u201cI take the two of them just as they are \u2013 kind of like separate things. I\u2019m trying to be the best athlete and best role model that I can be to show people that they can do the sport, that the sport is for everybody.\u201d At the age of 24, Dearing was making history in Japan and became a beacon of hope for young people \u2013 especially Black girls \u2013 who wanted to break into the sport.   But her personal triumph also drew attention to the institutional access gap for people of color in swimming.    \u201cFortunately, for myself, I haven\u2019t come across any barriers at the level I\u2019m at currently,\u201d Dearing says.   \u201cBut I have faced barriers when I was younger and issues where people just don\u2019t think Black people should swim, or do swim, or think that we\u2019re better suited to other sports and so shouldn\u2019t even learn to swim or attempt swimming in the first place.\u201d  CNN reached out to the International Swimming Federation (FINA), Sport England and USA Swimming requesting a breakdown of Black and ethnic minority participation in swimming at grassroots and professional levels of the sport. However, they told CNN they were unable to provide such data.  FINA \u2013 the global governing body for swimming \u2013 told CNN it does not have a breakdown of the ethnicities of swimmers at a grassroots or elite level.   FINA said in 2021 it allocated $6.6 million towards development programs for distribution among all national federations and continental associations, while also pushing for diversity in the sport through its \u201cSwimming for All, Swimming for Life\u201d program.   \u201cFINA remains fully committed to non-discrimination,\u201d the organization said to CNN in a statement. \u201cFINA continues to work hard to ensure that the global aquatics community is a place where all athletes, coaches and administrators are treated equally. \u201cWork will continue to develop and grow with the support of members of the aquatics community as we strive to be at the forefront of this essential area,\u201d FINA added.    Sport England told CNN in a statement that it is \u201ccommitted to increasing investment in facilities and organisations across England to try to level up access to good quality sports and activities.\u201d \u201cBarriers to getting active persist and have even been exacerbated for some disadvantaged groups \u2013 like women, people with long-term health conditions, disabled people, people from ethnically diverse communities and lower socio-economic groups,\u201d the statement added.   Sport England said in May it announced further funding that brings its total investment in its 121 partners to more than \u00a3550 million ($670 million), which they\u2019ve selected \u201cdue to their unique position to tackle entrenched activity inequalities and influence positive change throughout the sector, their own networks and beyond.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s not all about the economic side of things. It is also about getting people to feel comfortable with putting their kids in swim lessons and in competitive swimming so that they can then go and do other aquatic-based sports,\u201d Joel Shinofield, the managing director of sport development at USA Swimming, told CNN during a phone call.  USA Swimming is a membership-serviced organization that has over 3,100 clubs and more than 400,000 members, according to the official website.   \u201cOur goal is to facilitate opportunities and make sure they\u2019re good ones. While our clubs are the ones that do that on the local level, the resources, guidance, support, financial investment that we provide can shift who those opportunities can be provided to and more broadly create access,\u201d he added.   Shinofield said that USA Swimming has established a 10-year initiative that will grant $1 million to develop learn-to-swim and competitive opportunities for communities served by Historical Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The program was announced in 2021, according to the USA Swimming official website.   Serving underrepresented communities  From representing their organization at the UK\u2019s first Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Summit For Sport in Birmingham, England earlier this year to facilitating swimming classes in Hackney \u2013 one of the most deprived boroughs in London \u2013 Obe hopes that the BSA will help bridge the barrier through community-level engagement.   \u201cThat community engagement really is to build trust, accountability and collaboration with disenfranchised communities and the sector,\u201d says Obe.  \u201cOnly in understanding these attitudes and understanding some of the barriers that preclude our communities from engaging in aquatics can we begin to drive change.\u201d  In August 2021, the BSA announced it would conduct a research program with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the University of Portsmouth, exploring the behaviors and barriers that prevent African, Caribbean and Asian communities from swimming.    Speaking about the program, Obe says: \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to inspire confidence with African, Caribbean and Asian communities, and the only way we\u2019re able to do that is to ensure that we understand where these communities are in the first place and understand why they don\u2019t engage in aquatics, why we don\u2019t see the representation pool side and why we don\u2019t even see the representation within some aquatic organizations.\u201d  Dale also volunteers with Mental Health Swims, a grassroots organization that facilitates swimming meet-ups for people struggling with their mental health. As part of her work for the organization, she coordinates swim events in south London to help swimmers access the mental health benefits of the sport. She also volunteers for Pride in Water, a network that aims to increase LGBTQ+ representation in swimming.   \u2018The future is bright\u2019  Dearing says that despite the racial and economic barriers to swimming for African, Caribbean and Asian communities, she\u2019s still optimistic about the changing landscape of the sport.  \u201cI really think if anything is going to change, it\u2019s going to be now, it\u2019s going to be over the next couple of years,\u201d she says. \u201cEach story is different, each person is different and has to be understood in their own way, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, that\u2019s just another challenge that we have to face and we\u2019re up for it.  \u201cIt\u2019s tough \u2013 it\u2019s not a quick fix, but the future is bright.  \u201cI like to feel that I\u2019m giving something back to swimming and, hopefully, giving something to the Black community to hopefully achieve, strive for and change the way that Black people are viewed in swimming and the way Black people view swimming.  \u201cIt\u2019s a double-edged sword; I absolutely love doing it. Sometimes, it\u2019s really frightening and daunting, but if I\u2019m trying to make the world a better place, then sometimes you got to step out and scare yourself.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/07/25/sport/black-representation-swimming-equality-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_sport_ukraine-russia-olympics-iryna-kolyadenko-intl-spt", "text": "As she hits the mats in a large, bright gym in a recreational area near Kyiv, the ongoing war with Russia is very much on Ukrainian wrestler Iryna Kolyadenko\u2019s mind. Amid thousands of\u00a0civilian casualties and as the war grinds on, Ukrainians like Kolyadenko competing at the Paris Olympics face an existential challenge as much as an athletic one. The 25-year-old is no stranger to the physical demands of training but for the first Olympics since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the one-time bronze medal winner is upping her mental game in anticipation of squaring off against Russian athletes. \u201cI consider it my mission to prevent them from getting on the podium,\u201d Kolyadenko told CNN. \u201cIf I show my emotions, demonstrate them, it will prevent me from winning \u2026 but, of course, there will be no handshakes,\u201d she said. Russians and Belarusians will be participating in the games as Individual Neutral Athletes and that means Ukrainian athletes could end up facing off against them. Ukraine\u2019s sports ministry has issued guidelines for their athletes competing at the upcoming Games in Paris including refraining from joint photos, press conferences, and events with Russian and Belarusian athletes, not commenting on social media, keeping a distance from them during award ceremonies, and much more. Acting Sports Minister Matviy Bidnyi told CNN that the reason for the recommendations was several incidents that have already occurred at competitions of various levels ahead of the Olympics, including the refusal to shake hands with a Russian athlete at the world championships, which resulted in disqualification for fencer Olga Kharlan. According to the Ukrainian Ministry of Sport, discussions were held with international federations in various sports over its athletes not wanting to shake hands with Russian and Belarusian athletes at the Paris Olympics. As a result, the international federations decided that Ukrainian athletes wouldn\u2019t be disqualified for not shaking hands with individual neutral athletes. For Kolyadenko, shaking hands with Russian and Belarusian athletes is a no-go. \u201cThe Russian military destroyed my apartment, the Russian military is destroying my life, the lives of my family and the whole country, how can I treat them? Of course, negatively. I don\u2019t want Russians to take part in the competition at all. This is unacceptable,\u201d she said. When Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Kolyadenko was at the gym in Kyiv where she now is training for the Paris Games. \u201cThat day, we were supposed to fly to Turkey for a competition, but at 4 a.m. we woke up hearing explosions. Of course, I was totally confused and didn\u2019t know what to do. \u201cBut then I gathered my thoughts, packed my things and went to Irpin \u2026 At that time, I did not understand what had happened,\u201d adds Kolyadenko as she recalled traveling to Dymtrivka village to be with her grandmother, aunt and sister. Three days later, she says, dozens of Russian military vehicles entered Irpin. Residential areas were shelled, and civilians were killed. The village where Kolyadenko and her family were staying, was under constant shelling. The family moved to the basement. One day, when Kolyadenko went upstairs to get her stuff, she says, the wrestler saw through her window there were Russian troops rappelling down a ladder from a helicopter. Running out of food, and with no water or gas, and no medicines being delivered and little prospect of evacuation, Kolyadenko and her relatives left the village \u201cIt was already very dangerous,\u201d said Kolyadenko. \u201cOn the roadsides there were shot up cars where people had been killed.\u201d Kolyadenko spent more than a day driving with her family and relatives. She says she didn\u2019t think about sports or training at all, because she didn\u2019t know if they would survive. \u2018We had no choice.. because our families were there\u2019 Kolyadenko was not the only one to experience such a life-threatening situation. The head coach of the women\u2019s wrestling team, Volodymyr Evonov, also encountered Russian troops at the base near Kyiv. Almost immediately, he left for his family in Kherson, even though there was already information that convoys of Russian heavy vehicles were heading towards the city from annexed Crimea. \u201cWe traveled to meet the war. We had no choice. On the way, we saw our military digging trenches. They told us not to go there. We went anyway. Because our families were there,\u201d Evonov told CNN as he recalled those first days of invasion. A week later, the Russians entered Kherson. Local residents resisted them, took to the streets with posters and flags to stop Russian tanks, and organized pro-Ukrainian rallies in the city\u2019s central square until repression began against the activists. The athletes had their own form of protest \u2013 they continued to train. \u201cWe trained regularly and waited for our military to release us,\u201d added Evonov. \u201cA month passed in this expectation. It was getting harder and harder. We got together with our coaches, took some of the athletes and our families and in mid-April (2022) we took advantage of the window of opportunity and managed to leave.\u201d After Evonov and his colleagues left their hometown, Kherson remained under occupation until the city was liberated in 2022, though it remains under constant shelling. It is no longer possible to continue training there, according to Evonov. Just a month after the war began, the women\u2019s national wrestling team was able to gather for a joint training session at the Olympic center of the Hungarian team in Tata. The Ukraine women\u2019s team was then invited to live and train in a safe environment by their Japanese colleagues, where they spent a fortnight in June 2023. The Ukraine women\u2019s team also spent another two months in the US, where they were hosted by local universities. These days, the women have returned to regular training at their base near Kyiv. They have endured blackouts caused by Russian targeting of electricity infrastructure and spent sleepless nights as missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles hit the city. While Kyiv is much better protected these days the war shows no sign of ending. Difficult training conditions The conditions under which the athletes have prepared for the Paris Olympics affected the team\u2019s results. At the Tokyo Olympics, the women\u2019s wrestling team won five licenses. This year, only two athletes \u2013 Kolyadenko and Oksana Livach \u2013 will go to Paris. According to Bidnyi, more than 100 athletes will represent the Ukrainian national team in Paris. Given the conditions in which they have been preparing for the Olympics over the past two years, the Ministry of Sports of Ukraine says this number of athletes competing is quite positive given that there is a war going on. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that during the aggression, when, for example, Russia caused a blackout last winter, it was very difficult to train,\u201d said Bidnyi. \u201cThe temperature in the halls sometimes dropped so much that we had to train in our outerwear. Another example is that our synchronized swimmers train in a pool in Kharkiv, which actually has a hole in the roof because a missile hit it. It is clear that these are not the conditions that can be called normal,\u201d added Bidnyi. Over 500 sports infrastructure facilities have been destroyed since the full-scale invasion, according to Bidnyi. These are the ones located on the territory controlled by Ukraine. There is no verified information about the destroyed infrastructure facilities in the occupied part. \u201cThere are athletes whose loved ones and parents are at constant risk,\u201d said Bidnyi. \u201cSomeone\u2019s relatives are serving on the frontline today, and the athletes are worried about them. \u201cSome of our athletes have lost their parents, who lived a peaceful life until a missile hit their home. There are a lot of such stories. Some lost their homes, some lost their loved ones,\u201d adds Bidnyi. For Kolyadenko, getting a license and preparing for the Paris Olympics was more difficult than for any other competition in her career. Given the uncertainty in Ukraine, she says she cannot plan her professional life after the Olympics. For now, here only goal is do her country proud.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/sport/ukraine-russia-olympics-iryna-kolyadenko-intl-spt/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_07_19_sport_tiger-woods-open-championship-cut-spt-intl", "text": "Tiger Woods has made an early exit from the Open Championship, but the US golfer has vowed to be back for the 2025 major. A second round six-over 77 at Royal Troon in Scotland on Friday improved upon an opening 79, but left the 48-year-old well short of the projected cut line for the top-70 players at 14-over par overall. It ties the three-time Open champion\u2019s highest ever 36-hole score of his major career, according to golf statistician Justin Ray, shot at the US Open in 2015 \u2013 the only previous season he had missed three consecutive cuts at the sport\u2019s four flagship events. \u201cJust was fighting it pretty much all day,\u201d Woods, who finished 60th at the Masters in April before failing to make the weekend at both the PGA Championship and US Open, told reporters. \u201cI never really hit it close enough to make birdies and consequently made a lot of bogeys.\u201d Signing off with par, Woods was given a standing ovation as crowds swarmed behind the ropes to get a last glimpse of him at Royal Troon, yet the 15-time major winner insisted it would not be his final Open. Woods \u2013 who is automatically qualified for the tournament as a result of his victories in 2000, 2005 and 2006 \u2013 said he will \u201cdefinitely\u201d be returning for next year\u2019s 153rd edition of the major at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland, in what would be his 24th outing at the event. The 82-time PGA Tour winner had arrived at Royal Troon adamant that he will play as long as he feels he can still win, shunning former world No. 2 Colin Montgomerie\u2019s suggestion he should consider retiring. This season marks the first since his 2021 car crash that Woods has competed at all four majors. In February, he had expressed his desire to compete in one tournament a month but \u2013 despite \u201cphysically feeling a lot better\u201d than at the beginning of the year \u2013 has only competed in five official events in 2024. \u201cI loved it. I\u2019ve always loved playing major championships. I just wish I was more physically sharp coming into the majors,\u201d he said Friday. \u201cObviously it tests you mentally, physically, emotionally, and I just wasn\u2019t as sharp as I needed to be. I was hoping that I would find it somehow, just never did. \u201cConsequently, my results and scores were pretty high,\u201d Woods, who shot just his sixth career major round of eight over or worse on Thursday, added. Playing partner and May\u2019s PGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele, who followed up an opening two-under 69 with a 72, said Thursday he could empathize with Woods\u2019 fight for sharpness. \u201cHe\u2019s making it as hard on himself as possible, and I know he\u2019s hard on himself too,\u201d Schauffele told reporters. \u201cHe\u2019s got to learn a little bit more about his body, what he can and can\u2019t do. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d like to prep more at home if his body would allow it \u2026 I know what goes into it and what needs to be done to play at a high level. If your body is not letting you do it, it\u2019s just frustrating.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/sport/tiger-woods-open-championship-cut-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_07_18_sport_rory-mcilroy-bryson-dechambeau-open-start-spt-intl", "text": "It was only last month that Rory McIlroy and Bryson DeChambeau were dueling for the US Open in the North Carolina sun. Yet, as the duo lumbered around a damp and windy Royal Troon on Thursday, that high-octane shootout might as well have taken place a lifetime ago. Reigning US Open champion DeChambeau and runner-up McIlroy slogged to slow starts at the 152nd Open Championship in Scotland, carding opening rounds of five-over 76 and 78 respectively to plummet away from the early leaders. Out to exorcise the demons of yet another heartbreaking major near-miss at Pinehurst No. 2, Northern Ireland\u2019s McIlroy was even-par through his first seven holes before his day began to unravel at the iconic \u201cPostage Stamp\u201d eighth. The world No. 2 winced in agony as his ball \u2013 which looked to have settled on the green of the 118-yard par-three \u2013 cruelly trickled into a nearby bunker. It took McIlroy two attempts to escape the sand, his exasperation compounded when his putt for bogey trickled inches past the cup. That double bogey was followed up by yet another at the par-four 11th, kickstarted by an out of bounds drive that sailed onto the train tracks running down the right side of the fairway. Forced to take a drop from the tee, McIlroy tapped in for six before more bunker trouble saw him add two more bogeys at the 15th and final holes. \u201cThe course was playing tough,\u201d the 35-year-old told reporters. \u201cThe conditions are very difficult in a wind that we haven\u2019t seen so far this week \u2026 one of those days where I just didn\u2019t adapt well enough to the conditions.\u201d It was another bitter day for McIlroy, who had looked on track to end his 10-year wait for a fifth major title at the US Open before he missed two putts from inside four feet across the last two holes to fall one shot shy of DeChambeau. McIlroy \u2013 who had made his previous 496 putts from within three feet \u2013 was left inconsolable, speeding away in his car almost immediately after his American rival tapped in for victory before announcing he would be taking a few weeks away from the game to process \u201cprobably the toughest\u201d day of his 17-year professional career. The 26-time PGA Tour winner returned with a tied-fourth finish at last week\u2019s Scottish Open in a strong warm-up for his pursuit of a second Open title, but now faces an uphill battle just to make the weekend, let alone add to the Claret Jug he won at Royal Liverpool in 2014. \u201cYour misses get punished a lot more this week than last week or even, geez, any week,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cAll I need to focus on is tomorrow and try to make the cut. That\u2019s all I can focus on.\u201d DeChambeau: \u2018I could have thrown in the towel\u2019 DeChambeau faired only slightly better as he began his chase of a second consecutive major crown, leaving the American to lament the wet weather and his own equipment. A double bogey at par-five sixth hole \u2013 the longest in championship history at 620 yards \u2013 proved the lowlight of the LIV Golf star\u2019s round. Having sparked his tee drive into the native area, DeChambeau\u2019s follow-up effort dribbled only a few feet before his subsequent shot careened onto an entirely different fairway. The 30-year-old was seven-over after another bogey at the 15th hole, but was soon fist-pumping \u2013 a celebration that had been a staple of his crowd-wooing US Open win \u2013 after lasering a stunning 54-foot eagle putt into the 16th cup. Two closing pars consolidated a strong finish, leaving DeChambeau to rue a sluggish start. \u201cI\u2019m just proud of the way I persevered today,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cShoot, man, I could have thrown in the towel after nine and could have been like, \u2018I\u2019m going home.\u2019 But no, I\u2019ve got a chance tomorrow. I\u2019m excited for the challenge.\u201d Nicknamed \u201cThe Scientist\u201d for his analytical approach to the game and willingness to experiment with new technologies, big-hitting DeChambeau said \u201cequipment-related\u201d issues had compounded his difficulty in adjusting to playing in the rain. \u201cIn colder, firmer conditions the golf ball is not compressing as much, so it\u2019s probably something along those lines,\u201d he added. \u201cFelt like I was swinging it somewhat okay, just the ball wasn\u2019t coming off in that window that I normally see, so it was a weird day \u2026 If I have some putts go in and hit some shots the way I know how to and figure out this equipment stuff, I\u2019ll be good.\u201d DeChambeau trailed Justin Thomas by eight shots when his compatriot returned to the clubhouse having opened with an impressive three-under 68. Thomas has struggled for form since capturing his second PGA Championship in 2022, missing the cut in five of his subsequent nine major outings, but looked like his former world No. 1 self as he poured in seven birdies. \u201cI just want to just keep playing as good as I can,\u201d the world No. 29 told reporters. \u201cI feel like everything has been turning the right way, and I\u2019ve been working on the right things, just haven\u2019t really had much to show for it.

{"id": "2023_09_20_sport_saudi-arabia-soccer-spl-bin-salman-intl-spt-cmd-dg", "text": "When Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal reportedly planned a $1.1 billion bid to sign French soccer superstar Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 \u2013 including $332 million to his club, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), and an eye-watering $775 million salary packet to the World Cup winner for just one year \u2013 it was slammed by critics as sportswashing. Mbapp\u00e9 might have said no to the offer in July, but a month later, Neymar Jr. said yes to Al-Hilal, as the Brazil star moved from PSG for a transfer fee of around $98.5 million (\u20ac90 million) plus add-ons, according to multiple reports. In a record-breaking transfer window, Saudi Pro League (SPL) clubs spent close to $1 billion, acquiring 94 overseas players from Europe\u2019s major leagues \u2013 France\u2019s Ligue 1, Spain\u2019s La Liga, Italy\u2019s Serie A, Germany\u2019s Bundesliga and the English Premier League \u2013 according to Deloitte. Despite the Arab nation\u2019s poor human rights record, Saudi Arabia\u2019s spending spree to turn its domestic soccer league into a star-studded, bona fide competition shows the seriousness of its ambition. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman says he doesn\u2019t \u201ccare\u201d about the country\u2019s investment in sport being described as sportswashing. \u201cWell if sportswashing is going to increase my GDP by one percent, then I will continue doing sportswashing,\u201d MBS said in an\u00a0interview\u00a0with Fox News which aired Wednesday. Pressed on if he was bothered by the use of the term, MBS continued: \u201cI don\u2019t care. I have one percent GDP growth from sport, and I am aiming for another one and a half percent. Call it whatever you want, we\u2019re going to get that one and a half percent.\u201d Saudi clubs, several of which have been taken over by the nation\u2019s sovereign Public Investment Fund (PIF), have already attracted some of the biggest names in the sport. By attracting some of the world\u2019s biggest stars to the Gulf states, the SPL wants \u201cto drive competitiveness on and off the pitch,\u201d though it\u2019s keen to emphasize that these overseas players will help develop \u201cyoung Saudi talent.\u201d During this summer transfer window, the government-controlled PIF increased the cumulative value of these four clubs nearly five times, making them the most valuable in the country, according to estimates by the sports website Transfermarkt. Plenty of other leading stars have eagerly said yes to the SPL, notably 2022 Ballon D\u2019Or winner Karim Benzema joining Al-Ittihad at the end of his contract with Spanish soccer giant Real Madrid. As the European transfer window came to a close, the four PIF-owned teams have spent nearly $900 million (\u20ac835.1 million) on buying elite international players, Transfermarkt data shows, which ranked them in the top 20 clubs in the world by transfer expenditure, alongside soccer giants from England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy. Al Hilal alone paid more than $378 million (\u20ac353 million), more than PSG and Arsenal, making it the second-largest spender this year. The newly acquired players join five-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, who has a two-year contract with Al-Nassr where he will earn a staggering estimated $200 million a year, according to Saudi state-owned media, currently making him the world\u2019s highest paid soccer player. As of today, 21 of the most expensive soccer players in Saudi Arabia by transfer fees \u2013 all international stars \u2013 play for one of the PIF-owned clubs. Despite the financial outlay, the SPL is remaining deliberately tight-lipped about the specifics of its financial gamble, with chief operating officer Carlo Nohra confirming to CNN Sport that it was \u201cnot in [the SPL\u2019s] competitive advantage\u201d to report the salaries offered to players and coaches. The PIF has $777 billion in assets under management, according to its most recent filing, with ambitions to top $1 trillion within a few years. In 2021, it acquired English soccer club Newcastle United, before focusing on investments at home. The club is now also among top spenders on players. Saudi clubs not owned by the PIF are also splurging on big-ticket players, with former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson, 33, offered an eye-watering salary of $870,000 (\u00a3700,000) per week, according to multiple reports, in an estimated $15 million (\u00a312 million) transfer from Liverpool to Saudi team Al-Ettifaq. In a recent interview with The Athletic, Henderson said those numbers \u201cjust aren\u2019t true.\u201d \u201cEssentially, the signal is \u2018We mean business,\u2019\u201d Simon Chadwick, a professor of sport and geopolitical economy at SKEMA Business School, told CNN.\u201cWe\u2019ve got so much money that for a player who is \u2026 coming towards the end of his career, we can afford to pay him 700,000 [GB pounds a week], or whatever it is that he\u2019s being paid, and still have Cristiano Ronaldo and still be in the market for other players as well,\u201d Chadwick said, describing Saudi\u2019s approach to becoming a sporting superpower, adding that the sky is the limit in terms of cost. Saudi\u2019s love of soccer Saudi Arabia follows in the footsteps of several other countries \u2013 including China and Qatar in investing large sums of money to try and turn themselves into soccer powerhouses. It remains to be seen whether Saudi\u2019s turbocharged investment will have a lasting impact or resemble something like a costly rebranding effort. The Saudi national team has been to multiple World Cups, and the country\u2019s clubs have won multiple Asian titles. Saudi\u2019s victory over Argentina during last year\u2019s men\u2019s World Cup was hailed as one of the greatest upsets in tournament history, with the country\u2019s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud granting a national public holiday in recognition of the win. Club games can attract huge crowds in the Middle Eastern nation. \u201cFor example, Al-Ittihad against Al-Hilal, you\u2019re talking about drawing crowds of 40, 50, 60,000 people, these are games that are comparable in size to Chelsea vs. Arsenal, Manchester United vs. Manchester City,\u201d Chadwick said. Buying star players, some arguably past their prime, also provides an easy win for Saudi teams, according to Kieran Maguire, co-host of \u201cThe Price of Football\u201d podcast. \u201cFrom the Saudi authorities\u2019 point of view, they\u2019re getting a ready-made product. Everybody\u2019s heard of Benzema. Everybody\u2019s heard of Cristiano Ronaldo and so on,\u201d Maguire said. Saudi Arabia\u2019s lofty sporting ambitions don\u2019t end with the SPL or Newcastle United. The country is hosting the 2023 FIFA Club World Cup and is bidding to host the 2027 AFC Asian Cup. Several media reports also indicated that the Gulf kingdom was considering launching a bid for the 2030 FIFA men\u2019s World Cup alongside Greece and Egypt \u2013 although it is reportedly mulling pulling its candidacy. Meanwhile, the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) has agreed to a contract that will see the Spanish Super Cup played in Saudi Arabia until 2029, a deal that will earn the Spanish governing body between \u20ac35-45 million ($38-48 million) a year. Appealing to the youth Saudi Arabia has a very young population: the country\u2019s most recent census revealed 32.2 million people live in the country, nearly 42% of whom are foreign nationals \u2013 and 51% of the Saudi population are under the age of 30.\u202fOf this populace, Saudi authorities say that over 80% play, attend or follow soccer, the national sport. Chadwick explains that Saudi Arabia\u2019s government is concerned with the prospect of its younger members of society becoming radicalized or an anti-government sentiment bubbling up like that of the Arab Spring \u2013 and looks to offer its population a thriving soccer industry to keep it placated. Though the soccer industry generates employment, revenues, export earnings and inward investment, \u201cwhat is just as significant is the security of the royal family,\u201d Chadwick adds. The Arab Spring, a wave of pro-democracy protests that washed over the Middle East and North Africa in 2011, achieved mixed results. Four Arab dictators in Libya, Yemen, Egypt and Tunisia were toppled, offering a brief sense of victory for protesters, but, since then, new wars have prompted a retreat of popular movements in the region. Meanwhile, failed uprisings in Bahrain and eastern Saudi Arabia were followed by years-long crackdowns and a continuing civil war in Syria. \u201cWhat we\u2019re beginning to see in Saudi Arabia right now is the emergence of a new social contract. And the social contract essentially is catering for the needs of the Gen Z population,\u201d Chadwick said. \u201cYou want Ronaldo? You got him. You want some of the best football teams in the world? You got them. You want the World Cup to come to Saudi Arabia? You got it \u2026 But don\u2019t question us,\u201d Chadwick explained. Maguire agrees, noting that investing in soccer \u201ccan be seen as part of a much broader socio-economic plan, run by the Saudi authorities.\u201d At the same time, there has been \u201ca significant increase in the number of Saudi Arabians detained by the authorities, for example, for posting adverse comments on social media about the country\u201d this year, Chadwick told CNN. Human rights group Amnesty International told CNN that it has documented a rollback in human rights in Saudi Arabia, including an escalating crackdown on freedom of expression and an increased use of counterterrorism and cybercrime laws to silence dissent. Between 2022 and 2023, the organization said it has documented an increase in criminal prosecutions compared to previous years. In 2022, Amnesty reported the highest number of annual executions in the country in 30 years, with 196 people killed. \u201cReputation is important in terms of attracting foreign investment, and \u2026 Mohammed bin Salman, as much as he has significant financial muscle, needs foreign investing for the realization of his diversification,\u201d James Dorsey, the author of the syndicated column and blog, \u201cThe Turbulent World of Middle East Soccer,\u201d explains. Saudi Arabia is the world\u2019s biggest exporter of crude oil, and nearly two-thirds of its income still comes from selling fossil fuels. But with oil prices regularly dipping below what the Gulf state needs to balance its budget, it has focused efforts on trying to bring in investment from abroad along with its efforts to raise oil prices. Projections indicate the kingdom has around 20 years to diversify its economy to ensure it is more resilient, according to Chadwick \u2013 not least to fund its Vision 2030 projects, including the $500 billion Neom city, a 106 mile-long linear city called The Line and a futuristic plan to revamp the capital. \u201cPart of the grand vision of Mohammed bin Salman, looking forward to 2030, he does have his desire to make Saudi Arabia less dependent on natural resources to look at a post-fuel economy [involving] tourism, entertainment. If Saudi Arabia can become a hub for major sporting events, then that\u2019s a way of attracting interest to the country,\u201d said Maguire. CNN has reached out to the Saudi Ministry of Sport for comment on allegations that the kingdom has been rolling back human rights, and investing in soccer as a way of \u201csportswashing\u201d its image. In response to previous criticism about Saudi Arabia\u2019s purported \u201csportswashing,\u201d the kingdom\u2019s sports minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal said: \u201cPeople that don\u2019t know Saudi Arabia, have never been to Saudi Arabia, go out and talk about it as if they\u2019ve lived there for 30 years, 40 years. So I always tell people, come to Saudi. Come and see Saudi. \u201cSee what it is, see the people, meet the people. Look at what the country is doing for the future of the people in Saudi, then you can criticize as much as you like,\u201d he added. Lack of transparency: Saudi threatens new systems of governance\u202fin sports Saudi Arabia has already disrupted the golf industry and, with soccer, Maguire told CNN, \u201cthey feel that they can do that probably on a smaller scale, but perhaps, ultimately, to generate more interest in terms of eyeballs if they go down the same route.\u201d In 2021, the Saudi government-controlled PIF bankrolled LIV Golf, reportedly at a cost of $2 billion, attracting many of the sport\u2019s top players away from the US-based PGA Tour and Europe-based DP World Tour by offering big dollar prize money, with PGA Tour board member Jimmy Dunne raising fears that they might end up \u201cowning golf.\u201d Earlier this year, the US-based PGA Tour announced it was set to partner with the Saudi-backed breakaway LIV Golf, ending a feud that has dogged the men\u2019s professional game for the past year, with Dunne warning that sport\u2019s governing body had no choice but to reach the truce to retain some measure of control. \u201cThey have an unlimited horizon and an unlimited amount of money,\u201d he said at a contentious Senate hearing on the truce between the two tours. When it comes to soccer, Aleksander Ceferin, president of European football\u2019s governing body UEFA, has dismissed the competitive threat that the SPL could pose. \u201cAs far as I know, Mbappe and [Erling] Haaland don\u2019t dream of Saudi Arabia. I don\u2019t believe that the best players at the pinnacle of their careers would go to Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said last month. \u201cWhen people talk to me about the players who went there, nobody knows where they\u2019re playing.\u201d Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp took a different view, referring to the fact that the Saudi summer transfer window stays open after European clubs see theirs close: \u201cI don\u2019t know how stable it is and I think the next two weeks will show how much of a challenge it is because whatever happens there, no one can react anymore. \u201cI don\u2019t know where it will lead to but it feels rather like a threat or a concern than not because I can\u2019t see how we really deny it in these moments, what can we do?\u201d he added. Still, the new SPL director of football, Michael Emenalo, says what Saudi soccer is doing is \u201cno different from what the Premier League have done.\u201d \u201cThere was a time when it was all about Italy. There was a time when it was all about Spain. What we\u2019re looking for in the industry is an opportunity to compete, and to compete on an even scale and to improve upon whatever exists in the industry,\u201d said Emenalo in a press release sent to CNN. New Saudi Pro League Chief Operating Officer Carlo Nohra told CNN that there is logic behind the league\u2019s strategy of money is no object to lure international stars. \u201cWe can\u2019t expect to be paying market value to entice people to come here at this early stage in our development.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0But analysts say that the difference lies in the level of transparency, which \u201csimply doesn\u2019t exist in Saudi Arabia,\u201d Chadwick explained to CNN. European soccer governing body UEFA has financial fair play (FFP) rules on teams\u2019 spending, while Major League Soccer in the US has a salary cap for its clubs. Nohra told CNN that, eventually, the country wants 0.3% of its GDP to be from soccer to make it similar to that of the Premier League on the UK economy \u2013 up from its current value of \u201c0.000 something.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve got no chance to get into that figure at present,\u201d Maguire explained, but added that the SPL could perhaps move into the top 10 of the world\u2019s domestic leagues. \u201cThat is feasible given the amount of money that they\u2019re spending.\u201d \u201cI think they\u2019re realistic. They don\u2019t say that they\u2019re going to overtake La Liga or the Premier League or the major European leagues,\u201d Maguire said. When the Peterson Institute for International Economics compared the world\u2019s sovereign wealth funds on criteria including governance, transparency and accountability in 2019, the PIF scored well below average on a measure combining these criteria, and ranked in the bottom 10 out of 64 funds, just above Russian Direct Investment Fund. CNN has reached out to the PIF for further comment about its investments in sport, particularly soccer and golf, and criticisms about its lack of transparency. Chadwick raised concerns over how a lack of financial rules affecting Saudi clubs might dilute UEFA\u2019s FFP regulations, as well as those of the Premier League, or impact world soccer governing body FIFA\u2019s systems of governance. The lack of transparency in Saudi Arabia\u2019s wealth fund has already raised suspicions in the US golfing and political spheres. Earlier this summer, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations launched an inquiry about the PGA Tour\u2019s agreement with the PIF-controlled LIV Golf. Chadwick told CNN that, so long as there is no independent organization that monitors the reporting of every league\u2019s financial endeavors, \u201cnobody really knows for sure what the accurate financial information is.\u201d \u201cThis vacuum [of information], this uncertainty is wrapped in a veneer of lobbying, which is intended to either overinflate or underinflate player transfer values and salary information because it serves a political purpose,\u201d Chadwick says, adding that this purpose is \u201csignaling.\u201d \u201cIt is almost as though football players are becoming kind of geopolitical pawns in some ways.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/09/20/sport/saudi-arabia-soccer-spl-bin-salman-intl-spt-cmd-dg/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_07_13_sport_wimbledon-paolini-krejcikova-womens-final-spt-intl", "text": "Barbora Krej\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 won her second grand slam and first Wimbledon title on Saturday, eventually overpowering Italy\u2019s Jasmine Paolini 6-2 2-6 6-4 in a thrilling women\u2019s final. The Czech has endured a difficult season, disrupted by injury and marked by a subsequent tumble down the world rankings, but all that faded away as she raised her arms to the sky in celebration and soaked in the applause of the crowd on Centre Court. Though she initially raced to a one set lead, Krej\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 had to call on all her experience as a seven-time grand slam doubles champion and 2021 French Open champion in the face of Paolini\u2019s spirited fightback. The Italian, playing in her second consecutive grand slam final, dragged the match to a deciding set and fended off two championship points before Krej\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 sealed victory at her third attempt, sparking emotional celebrations. She bounded into her box and was mobbed by her team before telling the crowd in an on-court interview that it was \u201cthe best day\u201d of her life. \u201cI was telling myself to be brave \u2026 It was such a difficult match, such a great final, such a great competition and I enjoyed it so much and I\u2019m super happy that I\u2019m standing here and I can enjoy this moment,\u201d she said. \u201cI think nobody really believes it. I don\u2019t think anyone will believe that I got to the final and that I won Wimbledon. I still can\u2019t believe it \u2026 I am standing here and I am a Wimbledon winner!\u201d By winning Wimbledon, Krej\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 emulated her late coach and mentor Jana Novotn\u00e1 who won here in 1998 and passed away from cancer in 2017. \u201cJana was the one that told me I had the potential and that I should definitely turn pro and try to make it. Before she passed away she told me to win a slam \u2026 I never dreamed that I would win the same trophy as Jana did in 1998,\u201d Krej\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 said. A hard-fought final Before this year, Paolini had never won a match at Wimbledon but such has been her meteoric rise this season that her presence in the final was not entirely unexpected. Although she made history as the first Italian woman to ever reach the Wimbledon final, it was ultimately another heartbreak for the 28-year-old coming just a month after she lost the French Open final too. There, Paolini lost to Iga \u015awi\u0105tek in straight sets and she seemed in danger of slipping to the same result on Saturday when Krej\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 produced a powerful display to dominate the first set. The Czech player enjoyed the best possible start, breaking Paolini in the first game before consolidating that break with a hold to love. Although Paolini stemmed the tide, holding in a mammoth game that featured four deuces, Krej\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1\u2019s onslaught kept coming, her powerful groundstrokes piling the pressure on Paolini who often found herself several steps behind the baseline or off the court. So when Krej\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 sealed the first set in just 35 minutes, it seemed that she was on course for a comprehensive win. But, suddenly, Paolini began the second set with a fresh injection of energy and the entire complexion of the match changed. Employing a more offensive approach, the Italian broke Krej\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 immediately and raced to a 3-0 lead. With the pressure mounting on the Czech player, she double faulted twice in a row and conceded another two break points but somehow managed to claw her way back into the game and get onto the scoreboard in the second set. Where Krej\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1\u2019s powerful first serve and groundstrokes had dominated the first set, it was Paolini\u2019s exceptional movement that dictated play in the second, allowing her to stay in, and win, points that seemed lost. \u201cTo see this stadium full it\u2019s a dream come true, to play here in this stage. I would like to congratulate Barbora, you played unbelievable,\u201d Paolini said afterwards on court. \u201cI try to keep smiling because I have to remember that today is still a good day. I was looking at the TV as a kid, looking at the finals cheering for Federer. I have to say to be here right now, it\u2019s crazy.\u201d With so much at stake in the third set, both players became more cautious and the match rested on a knife edge until 3-3 when Krej\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 engineered two break points and converted one of them to take the lead. Then, she served for the championship and had a championship point but Paolini still fought back, and even had a break point to level the set. But Krej\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1\u2019s experience eventually told and she sealed an impressive, hard-fought win.

It\u2019s remains one of the most unlikely stories in sport. The players, then, who delivered the miracle on that balmy night in Lisbon, Portugal, are still considered heroes to this day. One of those stars was Stelios Giannakopoulos, who walked out for the Euro 2004 final knowing he was on the verge of something incredibly special. The Greece midfielder says his team was confident it could defy all logic by winning the nation\u2019s first international soccer title, with just the host nation Portugal standing in its way. Very much outsiders at the start of the tournament, Greece had already beaten Portugal during its incredible run to the final and was now facing the host once more \u2013 only this time with history at stake. \u201cI looked at the trophy. As I\u2019m going past it I had a glimpse and I said \u2018you will be mine in one-and-a-half hours\u2019,\u201d Giannakopoulos tells CNN Sport, reflecting on his thoughts just moments before the biggest match of his life. \u201cI was so confident that we would make it that I couldn\u2019t wait for the game to get started. Especially after you sing the national anthem with your compatriots that have flooded the stands. We were feeling that we were playing in Athens or something. It was unbelievable.\u201d Greece had ripped up the rulebook on its miraculous run to the final on July 4, 2004. After beating Portugal in its opening group game, it went on to claim a draw against Spain, before earning wins against Poland, France and Czech Republic. The only game Greece lost in the tournament was its final group game against Russia. \u2018Magical\u2019 journey Back in Greece, the country had come to a standstill to watch the final.

He was living in the US when Greece reached the final, and remembers sitting down to watch the game on television with his family. \u201cIt was magical,\u201d Tsitsonis tells CNN Sport as remembers watching the final that was played on the fourth of July. \u201cLooking to my left and seeing both my grandparents, who have now passed on, who had never watched football in their lives, would never have been interested in any sort of way, but everybody was so invested in what was happening on that television screen.\u201d Back in Lisbon and Greece was facing a tough task. Portugal was not only playing at home, but it also possessed some of the greatest players on the planet. The legendary Lu\u00eds Figo was still in his prime, Deco was regarded as arguably the best midfielder in the world and a young Cristiano Ronaldo was starting to make his mark on the international stage. Lining up on the left-wing, former English Premier League star Giannakopoulos was facing  the indomitable Figo, but says his nerves were quelled by the confidence he had in his own teammates. Without any standout star, the Greek players relied heavily on teamwork and formed a formidable defense which leaked just four goals during the tournament. While keeping goals out, offensively the team also mastered the art of set-pieces and proved a constant threat from corners. It was a plan that worked again in the final when Greece scored the only goal of the game \u2013 Angelos Charisteas sparking jubilant scenes as his header from a corner rippled the back of the net in the 57th minute. The celebrations that followed are now etched into folklore, with a sea of blue and white fans falling over themselves in the stands. In the US, Tsitsonis and his wife had hung Greek flags out of the car window and were driving around the back roads, honking their horns in celebration. Meanwhile, fireworks lit up the Athens sky as thousands of fans flooded out onto streets to celebrate an unprecedented success. \u201cEverybody was just in such a state of euphoria, no matter whether you were in the stadium, in Greece, or across the Greek diaspora,\u201d Tsitsonis said, smiling at the memories. \u201cI think even we knew at that time that this was probably a once in a lifetime thing that we were living.\u201d Moment of glory Giannakopoulos, who watched the final minutes of the final from the bench, still recalls the angst of waiting for the fulltime whistle, but remembers the explosion of emotion he felt as the entire squad ran onto the pitch when the referee blew his whistle. \u201cIt was a moment of glory for us. Moments that will remain there forever and for the generations to come,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone included in that squad was blessed. It was an unreal dream that came true for us. For our country. For Greek football. The power of football is massive.\u201d Prior to 2004, the national team setup had been disjointed, and the squad had been considered serial underachievers. But under German coach Otto Rehhagel, everyone seemed to be pulling in the same direction and Tsitsonis says the 2004 victory was a cathartic moment for the Greek people who had longed to celebrate some soccer success. The Euro 2004 triumph came shortly before the country hosted the summer Olympic Games, an event that further united the population. Tsitsonis says the memories of that \u201cmagical Greek summer\u201d were clung to during the difficult years that followed for the nation, as it was plunged into economic chaos following the financial crisis in 2008, resulting in rampant unemployment across Greece. For Giannakopoulos, the team\u2019s Euro 2004 victory was further proof of what the Greek people can do when they come together. \u201cIf we stick together, we can make miracles happen. We can make wonders,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s in the DNA of our nation. We are very, very strong as a nation. History proves that. Once more through football, we proved that. It was a big metaphorical message.\u201d The current Greek national team failed to qualify for this year\u2019s European Championship after losing to Georgia in an agonising penalty shootout in the play-off final. In truth, Greece has never come close to matching those heroics from 2004 \u2013 perhaps unsurprising given the depth of quality throughout world soccer currently. Now, 20 years on, Spain and England will have the chance to produce a magical moment for their countries in the final of this year\u2019s tournament, but neither side\u2019s victory will compare to the shock produced by Greece all those years ago.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/sport/greece-euro-2004-title-miracle-anniversary-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Schumacher, the younger brother of seven-time champion Michael Schumacher, posted a picture with his partner on Instagram, who was later named as Etienne by German actress Carmen Geiss, a close friend of Schumacher\u2019s. \u201cThe most beautiful thing in life is when you have the right partner by your side with whom you can share everything,\u201d Schumacher wrote on Instagram. He was previously married to Cora Schumacher and is the father to a son, David. The 49-year-old had an 11-year F1 career, driving for Jordan, Williams and Toyota and won six races along the way. He is only the second Formula One driver to identify as gay, with Hamilton saying that Schumacher\u2019s announcement sends a \u201cpositive message.\u201d \u201cI think clearly he\u2019s not felt comfortable being able to say it in the past and it\u2019s definitely not a new thing, but I think it just shows that we are in a time that finally you can take that step and don\u2019t have to fear,\u201d Hamilton said ahead of this weekend\u2019s Hungarian Grand Prix, via Sky Sports. \u201cEven him taking that step sends such a positive message and liberates others to be able to do the same. We need more and more people to do that.\u201d Hamilton has long been a defender of LGBTQ rights and has received praise for donning a helmet featuring the Pride flag at several races, including at the Qatar and Saudi Arabia Grands Prix. The Mercedes driver spoke about the need for F1 to \u201cdo more\u201d in order to make the sport more inclusive following Schumacher\u2019s announcement. \u201cWithin sports, I think it still has a long way to go,\u201d said the 39-year-old. \u201cThere is one thing saying that it\u2019s inclusive and there\u2019s another thing actually making sure that people actually feel comfortable in the environments. \u201cThis is a male-dominated space and, as far as I know, he\u2019s one of the first to at least publicly be speaking in that respect.

{"id": "2024_07_18_sport_tiger-woods-donald-trump-assassination-attempt-spt-intl", "text": "Tiger Woods said he endured a sleepless flight to the Open Championship after watching coverage of the assassination attempt on Donald Trump. The 48-year-old golfer set off from Florida on Saturday for the 152nd edition of the major in Scotland this week, but was left weary for his first practice round at Royal Troon on Sunday after closely following developments at the former president\u2019s rally in Pennsylvania. \u201cI didn\u2019t accomplish a lot because I wasn\u2019t in the right frame of mind,\u201d Woods told BBC Sport on Tuesday. \u201cIt was a long night (because of the assassination attempt) and that\u2019s all we watched the entire time on the way over here. I didn\u2019t sleep at all on the flight, and then we just got on the golf course.\u201d Fifteen-time major champion Woods was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2019 \u2013 shortly after his comeback win at the Masters \u2013 by Trump, who was wounded in the shooting that saw one rally attendee killed and two others seriously injured. Trump, an avid golfer, has a long history with Woods, with the pair playing numerous rounds together over the years. Asked about his purported friendly relationship with the then-president in 2018, Woods replied: \u201cWell, he\u2019s the president of the United States.\u201d \u201cNo matter who is in the office, you may like, dislike personality or the politics, but we all must respect the office,\u201d he added, according to Yahoo Sports. Woods teed off in pursuit of a fourth Open Championship victory on Thursday, having lifted the Claret Jug in 2000, 2005 and 2006. It would be a shock win on his 23rd appearance at the major, given Woods\u2019 persistent battles with injuries and rehabilitation following leg injuries in a 2021 car crash that have contributed to sporadic competitive appearances. The 82-time PGA Tour winner has endured a difficult major season, having finished 60th at the Masters before missing the cut at both the PGA Championship and US Open. Nevertheless, Woods remains adamant he will play as long as he feels like he can win, shunning suggestions by former world No. 2 Colin Montgomerie that he should consider retiring. \u201cWell, as a past champion, I\u2019m exempt until I\u2019m 60. Colin\u2019s not,\u201d Woods told reporters Tuesday, referencing the fact that he has earned automatic qualification for the major through his past victories at the event. \u201cHe\u2019s not a past champion, so he\u2019s not exempt. So he doesn\u2019t get the opportunity to make that decision.

{"id": "2024_07_16_sport_olympics-athletes-compensated-medal-spt-intl", "text": "The Olympics are the pinnacle of many athletes\u2019 careers, and the opportunity to perform on the global stage can see their names etched into history forever. On the line are Olympic medals \u2013 gold, silver and bronze \u2013 as well as the recognition that comes with them. But, unlike many other professional sports, financial reward isn\u2019t necessarily a prize awarded to Olympic athletes in the past. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about Olympic athletes and the compensation they can receive. The first ever medals Gold, silver and bronze medals haven\u2019t always been standardized. In the first modern Olympic Games in 1896, winners received an olive branch and a silver medal, an award which was first accepted by triple jump champion James B. Connolly of Massachusetts. Medals were initially designed to be pinned to an athlete\u2019s chest, but the design shifted in 1960, allowing the medal to be hung around the winner\u2019s neck. It was only at the 1904 Summer Games in St. Louis where the now traditional medals were introduced. The 2024 design At the 2024 Games in Paris, the medals won by athletes will each contain an original piece of the Eiffel Tower, the 19th-century landmark which has become so synonymous with the French capital. The Games originated as an amateur competition While the medals are highly sought-after accolades, receiving one doesn\u2019t come with any financial bonuses directly from the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the organizers of the Games. This is because the Games originated as an amateur competition intended to champion athletic success and the spirit of sports. Instead, the IOC spreads its money far and wide to further help the development of sport and its athletes. \u201cThe IOC redistributes 90% of all its income, in particular to the National Olympic Committees (NOCs) and International Federations (IFs),\u201d the IOC said in a statement sent to CNN. \u201cThis means that, every day, the equivalent of $ 4.2 million goes to help athletes and sports organizations at all levels around the world. It is up to each IF and NOC to determine how to best serve their athletes and the global development of their sport.\u201d And according to Mark Conrad, a professor of law and ethics at Fordham University Gabelli School of Business, that model isn\u2019t likely to change anytime soon. \u201cI don\u2019t see the day that all Olympic athletes will be paid by the IOC, because the IOC has never thought of them as a labor force \u2013 which in some ways they are, because they\u2019re providing entertainment for a mass audience as well as wanting to compete and win medals,\u201d Conrad told CNN. However, there are more direct methods for athletes to earn money via their success at the Games. 2024 is the first year track and field athletes will receive prize money for gold medals While the IOC doesn\u2019t offer direct prize money for medals, the governing body of track and field \u2013 the most iconic events at the Olympics \u2013 will do so after a surprise announcement in April. World Athletics (WA) revealed that gold medalists in track events at Paris 2024 will receive prize money, becoming the first international sports governing body to do so. A prize pot of $2.4 million has been set aside by WA from the IOC\u2019s revenue share allocation it receives every four years to reward athletes. Those who win gold in each of the 48 track and field events in Paris will receive $50,000, and relay teams will receive the same amount to share amongst the athletes. While the prize money will only be for gold medalists, WA said that it is committed to extending the bonus initiative to Olympic silver and bronze medalists at the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games. The announcement received a mixed response. The Association of Summer Olympic International Federations (ASOIF) said it had \u201cseveral concerns\u201d about the move, arguing that the introduction of prize money \u201cundermines the values of Olympism and the uniqueness of the Games. \u201cOne cannot and should not put a price on an Olympic gold medal and, in many cases, Olympic medalists indirectly benefit from commercial endorsements,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cThis disregards the less privileged athletes lower down the final standings.\u201d The International Boxing Association (IBA) also announced in May that it will hand out financial rewards totaling more than $3.1 million in the boxing competitions. Gold medalists will receive $100,000 from the IBA, with the athlete receiving half and the NOC and the athlete\u2019s coach receiving $25,000 apiece. Silver medalists will get $50,000, with the athlete receiving $25,000 and the rest split evenly between the coach and the NOC. For a bronze medal, the IBA will give out $25,000, including $12,500 to the athlete. \u201cOur athletes and their efforts must be appreciated,\u201d IBA president Umar Kremlev said in a statement. \u201cThe IBA offers opportunities and invests considerably in our boxers, they remain as the focal point, and we will continue to support them at all levels.\u201d The debate around paying athletes Athletes can also earn prize money through other means. At a press conference in May, IOC president Thomas Bach explained that it is \u201ccommon practice\u201d for athletes to receive prize money from NOCs, governmental bodies or through sponsors for their achievements at the Olympic Games. Bach recalled his own memories of this process, recounting how he and his teammates received prize money from the German NOC for the fencing gold medal they won at the 1976 Games. At the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in Beijing, US athletes received a total of $5.6 million in payments for medal performances through \u201cOperation Gold.\u201d For instance, the US Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC) pays its gold medal winning athletes $37,500, $22,500 for silver and $15,000 for bronze. With the IOC focused on distributing its funding to further the development of sports around the world, Bach said it falls upon the NOCs and IFs \u2013 who he claimed are the primary beneficiaries of the \u201ccommercial success of the Games\u201d \u2013 to choose how they incentivize their athletes and provide the best conditions for their delegations to perform in. \u201cThe NOCs, they should use this money to provide to the Olympic Games the best athletes in their national delegation and to support them so that they can compete at the highest possible level in the Games,\u201d Bach said. \u201cAnd they do so and then many of them reward the athletes with prize money for winning medals or diplomas or whatever. And this is absolutely in line and fine and common practice for decades. Bach continued: \u201cThe role of the IFs, according to this common understanding, is that they have to make every effort to try at least to close the gap between athletes coming from privileged countries or NOCs and from less privileged countries or NOCs. \u201cThey are, in this way, part of the solidarity effort of the IOC to do everything to create, in the best possible way, equal conditions for all athletes around the world and to help them to develop and to help them to have good coaches, good training conditions.\u201d But, according to Conrad, the process of receiving money through sponsorships is weighted heavily in favor of the superstar athletes, with many of the lesser-known Olympic participants forced to spend their own money to fund their way. \u201cGetting those endorsements is not easy. I mean, you really have to be Simone Biles level or Sha\u2019Carri Richardson level to get significant endorsement money,\u201d Conrad explained. For example, Biles earns $7 million from endorsements, according to Forbes. \u201cWhat sometimes companies will do, and it really depends on the level one is in, their endorsement deal will be free equipment and a few promotional events, but not a lot of money. And chances are it\u2019s going to be the Olympic champions who will then get an endorsement for a lot of money.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/sport/olympics-athletes-compensated-medal-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_sport_stan-smith-tennis-fashion-icon-wimbledon-spt-intl", "text": "Depending on your age, the name Stan Smith probably means one of two things. For younger people, it\u2019s the name of a sleek and stylish leather Adidas sneaker. For those of an older age, it\u2019s the name of a strapping six-foot-four, moustachioed US tennis star. \u201cPeople sometimes are surprised that there is even a person affiliated with that name at all,\u201d Smith tells CNN with a chuckle. \u201cIt\u2019s been interesting over the years and it\u2019s been fun in many ways to see people\u2019s reactions \u2026 finding out there was a tennis player named Stan Smith.\u201d It\u2019s rare for somebody to be talented and charismatic enough to become an icon in one field. It is rarer still for somebody to become an icon in two. As sports journalist Cari Champion notes in the documentary \u2018Who is Stan Smith?\u2019, which explores the remarkable life of the two-time grand slam champion, activist and style icon: \u201cHe has his face on a sneaker. Even Jordan\u00a0doesn\u2019t have his face on a sneaker.\u201d The documentary\u2019s Emmy Award-winning director Danny Lee tells CNN \u201cthere\u2019s something very understated and human\u201d about Smith. \u201cHe never, I think, endeavoured to become an icon and I think when it happens organically within culture, and in this respect, sports culture and fashion, it just makes more sense. \u201cSo there\u2019s something of Stan\u2019s personality that\u2019s imbued in the shoe. It\u2019s understated. It\u2019s elegant. It\u2019s stately. And I think that\u2019s why it works.\u201d In the mid to late 1970s, it became increasingly common to see people wearing sneakers casually, outside of the gym and integrating them into their individual outfits. The rise in popularity of the Stan Smith sneaker coincided with a slump towards the end of his tennis career and it began permeating a wide array of cultures in the UK and US. Young soccer fans began wearing them on the terraces in the UK, partly inspired by David Bowie donning the sneaker in the late \u201870s. Then came its impact on hip-hop culture, led largely by the Beastie Boys and RUN-D.M.C.\u2019s world tour in the late 1980s and the release of the single \u2018My Adidas.\u2019 \u201cEvery community embraced that shoe,\u201d Pharrell Williams says in the documentary \u2013 \u201cHustlers, drug dealers.\u201d During the 1972 French Open in Paris, Adidas chairman Horst Dassler, son of the company\u2019s founder, asked for a midnight meeting with Smith and his agent Donald Dell. Adidas wanted to expand into the USA and saw Smith, the newly crowned US Open champion, as the perfect fit. The leather design and perforations on the side of the shoe \u2013 which at the time of its launch was named Adidas Robert Haillet after the French tennis star \u2013 were technological advancements, historian and designer Gary Aspden explains in the documentary. Smith agreed to wear the sneaker at Wimbledon that year, a tournament he went on to win. \u201cIt had Haillet\u2019s name on the shoe for about six or seven years and then they wanted to expand to the US market, so they asked me to be involved,\u201d Smith tells CNN. \u201cI was the number one player in the world at the time, an American, so they put my picture on the tongue and they had Haillet on the side. \u201cThey had several iterations along the way. Then, finally, about four or five years later, they took the Haillet name off the shoe. And as they say, the rest was history.\u201d Arthur Ashe and the Davis Cup The documentary charts Smith\u2019s rise from a working-class family in Pasadena, California, where he was scouted by a club called the Pasadena Tennis Patrons. The club was made up of wealthy parents in the area, who would cover the costs of talented youngsters trying to turn professional. In the 1960s, the Davis Cup \u2013 a team tournament contested by countries from around the world \u2013 was one of the most prestigious tennis tournaments in the world, unlike the lesser status it commands today. In 1963, the USA welcomed Mexico to the Los Angeles Tennis Club for the Americas semifinal and it was there that a young Smith, a ball boy at the time, first caught a glimpse of rising tennis star Arthur Ashe. Ashe being selected for the team was a \u201chuge deal,\u201d Dell says in the documentary. Ashe was the first African American to play on the US Davis Cup team. At that time, a year before US President Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act, segregation was still rampant in America \u2013 the documentary shows clips of \u201cWhite\u201d and \u201cColored\u201d entrances and waiting areas \u2013 and Ashe couldn\u2019t go everywhere his teammates could go. Smith eventually made the US Davis Cup roster and in 1968, alongside doubles partner Bob Lutz - portrayed as Smith\u2019s early club rival in the documentary - led the team to victory, ending Australia\u2019s four-year chokehold on the title and simultaneously helping to spark a surge in the sport\u2019s popularity across the US \u2013 known as the \u2018tennis boom.\u2019 In the documentary, produced by LeBron James\u2019 Uninterrupted company, Dell calls 1968 \u201can extremely violent year in America.\u201d Activist Martin Luther King Jr. was murdered in April of that year as protests against racial injustice raged across the country, which was also divided about the ongoing Vietnam war. Ashe began using his platform as one of the US\u2019s best tennis players to speak out, saying in a 1968 interview that \u201cthere\u2019s really a mandate that you do something\u201d if you\u2019re Black and in the public eye. Smith witnessed the racism Ashe had to face when traveling around America to play tennis. In the documentary, Smith recounts one incident in Houston, Texas where the tennis club wouldn\u2019t allow Ashe to use the men\u2019s changing rooms, instead making him use the junior facilities. Smith admits in the documentary that his upbringing was \u201cisolated,\u201d which meant he didn\u2019t really \u201cdwell on the racial injustice as a kid.\u201d \u201cBut as we travelled around the United States and the world, I got to see that \u2013 and worse,\u201d he adds. Smith and Ashe, who died in 1993 aged 49, developed a close friendship and deep bond, a running theme throughout the documentary. Smith says he is still close with Ashe\u2019s wife and daughter. \u201cI think the experience of traveling around the world with Arthur and with all the other players on the tour \u2026 it was that way when I first got on it [activism],\u201d Smith says. \u201cSo I got to realize from all this experience that people are more alike than they are dissimilar and therefore looking for the same kind of meaning in life. \u201cI think that that really made an impact on me and realizing that there were things happening around the world that were terrible. \u201c\u201868 was a tumultuous year worldwide with the Vietnam War going on and people protesting, first equal rights and of course in South Africa, things were going on that made our inner-city areas look like Hollywood in Beverly Hills compared to what was going on in Soweto and Alexandria, those townships there.\u201d Lee says Smith\u2019s \u201cNorth Star\u201d in his career and life has been to \u201cpay it forward, to help people that might not have the opportunities that he might have.\u201d That was never more apparent than in the case of Mark Mathabane, a Black South African tennis player that Smith, his wife Marjory and Ashe helped escape apartheid. The two met when Smith practicing for a tournament in Johannesburg in 1977. Smith helped Mathabane get a place at the University of South Carolina. Mathabane later became a bestselling author for his autobiography \u201cKaffir Boy,\u201d the story of his childhood under a brutal regime. Wimbledon turmoil In 1968, star tennis players began leaving what was then an amateur sport and defecting to the professional circuit, which meant they would no longer be eligible to compete in the amateur-only grand slams. However, the International Tennis Federation eventually relented after much turmoil and the Open Era was born. Five years later, Smith arrived at Wimbledon as the defending champion after winning the title in 1972. It was the pinnacle of his career. \u201cIt was one of my goals to win that tournament,\u201d Smith says. \u201cIt was like the world\u2019s championships in a way, even though it wasn\u2019t officially. So I really worked hard and it motivated me in everything I did to try to win that tournament. \u201cSo when I lost in the final in \u201871, getting very close to that goal, winning in \u201872 was even more special.\u201d Ahead of the tournament in \u201873, the Yugoslav Tennis Association was unhappy with its star player, Niki Pili\u0107, after he opted to play in the professional World Championship of Tennis doubles final rather than represent his country in the Davis Cup. Pili\u0107 was suspended for nine months by his country\u2019s tennis association, which then phoned Wimbledon organizers and requested he be banned from competing \u2013 a request that was granted. In protest, the players formed the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and 13 of the 16 seeds \u2013 including defending champion Smith \u2013 withdrew in support of Pili\u0107. \u201cThe history of tennis as it became open and democratized during the \u201860s and \u201870s where revolution was everywhere throughout the world - and that was no different in tennis when Stan defied and boycotted Wimbledon in \u201973,\u201d Lee says. \u201cAnd he led the charge in unionizing the sport with the ATP. So all of that story, when you put on those shoes, a lot of that is imbued in the shoe.\u201d Throughout the film, Smith regularly mentions the four goals he wrote down for himself at the start of his career: Make the US Davis Cup team, become No. 1 in the US, win Wimbledon and then become the world No. 1. Smith accomplished all of that \u2013 and much more.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/sport/stan-smith-tennis-fashion-icon-wimbledon-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "sports"}}

After an underwhelming win over Australia on Monday, USA big man Anthony Davis lamented the team\u2019s lack of effort, but there was plenty of hustle on display against Serbia. The giant duo of Davis and Bam Adebayo off the bench proved key in the victory, helping limit Joki\u0107 to a paltry 6-of-19 shooting night. \u201cWe have plenty of guys who can score,\u201d coach Steve Kerr said, per the NBA. \u201cThat\u2019s not a problem for us. We want defense, defense, defense. \u201cBam and AD together are really something, just the switching, but they can also protect the rim and be in a drop if we go to that coverage. \u201cThe strength of the team is the depth, and so if we can play in four- or five-minute bursts of just playing intense defense, hitting bodies, rebounding being physical, then it makes sense to play that way.\u201d Steph Curry had a game-high 24 points that included 18 points in a scorching 11-minute stretch to start the game.

{"id": "2024_07_14_sport_spain-england-euro-2024-final-spt-intl", "text": "Spain won a record-breaking fourth European Championship, defeating England 2-1 following a drama-filled second half in the Euro 2024 final on Sunday in Berlin. Nico Williams \u2013 one of Spain\u2019s breakout performers at the tournament \u2013 gave La Roja the lead minutes into the second half when he smartly finished in the bottom corner from a perfectly-weighted pass from the team\u2019s other emerging star, freshly turned 17-year-old Lamine Yamal. England equalized midway through the second half through a brilliantly placed left-footed effort from Cole Palmer from outside the box to restore parity at the Olympiastadion in the German capital. But with just under five minutes remaining in regulation time, Spain took a late lead when Mikel Oyarzabal tapped home an inch-perfect pass from Marc Cucurella to cap off a victory and a terrific tournament for La Roja. It is Spain\u2019s fourth Euro title \u2013 having previously won in 1964, 2008 and 2012 \u2013 while for England, it is heartbreak for a second straight European Championship having been beaten by Italy on penalties at Euro 2020. The game began in tight fashion befitting a major final, with both teams feeling one another out as the players overcame any pre-match nerves. As predicted by many, Spain enjoyed the majority of the possession in the opening 30 minutes, however, it did so without producing any real goalscoring opportunities. While La Roja dominated the ball as it strived to create an opening, it was England which had the first shot on target on the stroke of halftime with a Phil Foden snapshot from close range, but it flew straight at Unai Sim\u00f3n in the Spanish goal. Spain was delt a major blow at halftime when one of its most important players, Manchester City midfielder Rodri, was forced off through injury. He was replaced by Real Sociedad\u2019s Mart\u00edn Zubimendi. But the Iberians didn\u2019t seem dismayed by the loss of their star midfielder when a sweeping move two minutes after the break was expectedly finished by Williams to give La Roja a deserved lead. At the age of 22 years and two days old, Williams became the second youngest player to score in a Euro final. The goal seemed to kick Spain up a gear, with Dani Olmo coming inches away from extending the lead a minute later, but his effort flew wide of the post. England was on the ropes in the aftermath of Williams\u2019 goal, first with captain \u00c1lvaro Morata\u2019s deft dink being cleared away by John Stones before the Athletic Bilbao man fired just wide as he searched for his second of the game. As the Three Lions sought a way back into the game, manager Gareth Southgate made the bold decision to bring off captain and all-time record goalscorer Harry Kane and replace him with Ollie Watkins, fresh off scoring a last-gasp winner in the semifinal against the Netherlands to book the team\u2019s spot in the final. The substitution seemed to galvanize the English, with the team playing with more verve and pace. Jude Bellingham fired an effort wide of the post which had the England fans on their feet for the first time in a while. But just when England was building a head of steam, Spain almost got a second through Yamal \u2013 who became the youngest player ever to feature in a Euro or World Cup final when he stepped onto the field on Sunday night \u2013 but Jordan Pickford stuck out a big hand to deny the Barcelona prodigy. England did eventually get its goal \u2013 and it came from one of Southgate\u2019s substitutes. Chelsea midfielder Palmer, who had been introduced into the game for 19-year-old Kobbie Mainoo just minutes before, latched onto a neat set-up from Bellingham and caressed an inch-perfect effort into the bottom corner to level the score. Spain built itself back into the game and came close to retaking the lead with 10 minutes remaining after some intricate build-up play left Yamal one-on-one with Pickford, but the 17-year-old\u2019s effort was parried away by the England goalkeeper. As time ticked away and extra-time loomed, Spain finally got its deserved late goal through another flowing move which ended with Cucurella sliding in an appealing cross for Oyarzabal to steer home and spark wild celebrations. England had become renowned for late heroics at Euro 2024, and the squad needed yet another moment of magic if it had any hopes of getting back into the game. As the clock hit 90 minutes, a corner was headed towards goal by Declan Rice, with Sim\u00f3n parrying it out to Guehi whose effort was cleared off the line by RB Leipzig man Dani Olmo as Spain\u2019s defense celebrated thwarting another English attack. The Three Lions threw everything they could to take it to extra time, but after four additional minutes, referee Fran\u00e7ois Letexier blew the final whistle and Spain\u2019s players dropped to the ground before joining the sea of fans clad in red and yellow inside the stadium in celebration. Royal support Ahead of the lifting of the trophy, Rodri was named the Euro 2024 player of the tournament, while Yamal was named the young player of the tournament. Yamal, who turned 17 the day before the final, appeared in every one of Spain\u2019s seven games in Germany, providing a tournament-high four assists and scoring one goal: a stunning, record-breaking effort in the semifinal against France which made him the youngest ever scorer in Euro history. For England, its 58-year search for a major men\u2019s international trophy goes on after winning the World Cup in 1966. Afterwards, King Charles III released a message of support for the England players on X, formerly known as Twitter. \u201cAlthough victory may have eluded you this evening, nevertheless my wife and I join all my family in urging you and your support team to hold your heads high. All those who have participated in sporting activities at any level will know how utterly despairing such a result can feel when the prize was so near \u2013 and will join me in sending heartfelt sympathy, even as we congratulate Spain. \u201cBut please know that your success in reaching the European Championship final is a really great achievement in itself, and one that brings with it the pride of a nation which will continue to roar for the Three Lions today \u2013 and in the many triumphs which I have no doubt lie ahead.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/sport/spain-england-euro-2024-final-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "sports"}}
