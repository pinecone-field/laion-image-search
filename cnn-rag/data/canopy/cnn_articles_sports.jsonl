It was another closely-fought, physical affair, epitomized by the moment when Reese\u2019s swinging arm caught Clark\u2019s head as she tried to block the Fever star from shooting \u2013 which officials determined was \u201cunnecessary contact\u201d and a flagrant foul 1. Clark sunk the resulting two free throws, as she contributed a game-high 23 points as well as eight rebounds and nine assists to steer the Fever to a 91-83 victory. There was little to separate the two teams for much of the game and it wasn\u2019t until Clark hit a 30-foot three pointer with just over three minutes remaining that either side was able to stretch its lead beyond seven points. The 22-year-old Clark formed a potent partnership with fellow star Aliyah Boston who finished with 19 points, 14 rebounds and four assists \u2013 her third consecutive double-double. Meanwhile, Marina Mabrey led the way for the Sky with 22 points, Kamilla Cardoso had her first WNBA double-double and Chennedy Carter had 18 points and four assists. Reese finished with 11 points, 13 rebounds and five assists. After the game, Clark was asked what she was thinking after the hard foul. \u201cWhat\u2019s going through my mind is: \u2018I need to make these two free throws, that\u2019s all I\u2019m thinking about,\u2019\u201d the rookie said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a part of basketball. It is what it is, you know. She\u2019s trying to make a play on the ball and get the block. But yeah, it happens.\u201d When asked after the game about the flagrant foul, Reese seemed to disagree with the referee\u2019s decision. \u201cIt was a basketball play,\u201d Reese said. \u201cI can\u2019t control the refs, they affected the game obviously a lot tonight.\u201d Later in the press conference, Reese took another verbal jab at the way the game was called. \u201cGoing back and looking at the film, I see a lot of calls that weren\u2019t made,\u201d said Reese. \u201cI guess some people got a special whistle \u2026 we\u2019re not gonna be denied, no matter what you guys can try to do.\u201d Clark and Reese\u2019s rivalry \u2013 both in the WNBA and college basketball \u2013 has triggered discourse about race in the US, while the Fever star has found herself being used by controversial figures on social media to push their agendas in American culture wars. Earlier this month, Reese said of the rivalry with Clark: \u201cPeople are pulling up to games, we got celebrities coming to games, sold out arenas, just because of [the 2023 NCAA championship game]. \u201cAnd just looking at that, I\u2019ll take that role. I\u2019ll take the bad guy role, and I\u2019ll continue to take that on and be that for my teammates.\u201d Reese continued: \u201cI\u2019ll look back in 20 years and be like, \u2018Yeah, the reason why we\u2019re watching women\u2019s basketball is not just because of one person. It\u2019s because of me too,\u2019 and I want y\u2019all to realize that. \u201c Clark was asked on Sunday why she thinks there is so much attention on the matchup between herself and Reese. \u201cI think it\u2019s just the emotion and the passion that we play with,\u201d Clark answered. \u201cPeople love to see that, and I think that\u2019s maybe not something that was always appreciated in women\u2019s sports. And it should be. I think that\u2019s what makes it fun. \u201cWe\u2019re competitors, that\u2019s the way the game should be. It\u2019s going to get a little feisty, it\u2019s gonna get physical, but at the end of the day both teams are just trying to win. \u201cI think what [Reese] has done with her platform has been absolutely incredible, and she has an entire fan base that has supported her and what she did at Maryland and then LSU,\u201d Clark continued. \u201cObviously I\u2019ve played her for a very long time, and she\u2019s been a tremendous player. It\u2019s been really fun getting to compete against. I think it\u2019s been good for the game \u2026 people just love seeing great matchups.\u201d WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert recently told USA Today that the league was \u201cthrilled with the rivalries that are being built.\u2019\u2019 \u201cLook, apathy is the death of a brand,\u201d said Engelbert. \u201cNobody\u2019s apathetic about the WNBA because we\u2019ve brought in so many new fans into what we call the fan funnel this year.\u201d After losing five straight games to start the season, the Fever have been 5-5 since and have won four of their last six games. The Sky, meanwhile, are on a four-game losing streak and have now lost six out of their last seven games. The Indiana Fever next play on Wednesday when they face the Washington Mystics, while the Chicago Sky will look to bounce back against the Dallas Wings on Thursday.

{"id": "2024_06_15_sport_euro-2024-switzerland-hungary-spain-croatia-italy-albania-spt-intl", "text": "Spain kicked off its Euro 2024 campaign with a statement 3-0 win over Croatia to earn a vital three points in the tournament\u2019s \u2018Group of Death.\u2019 La Roja was out of the blocks rapidly and made Croatia pay for a sluggish start. First-half goals from \u00c1lvaro Morata, Fabi\u00e1n Ruiz and Dani Carvajal \u2013 fresh from scoring in the Champions League final \u2013 opened up a dominant lead that the Kockasti never looked like coming back from. As well as Spain and Croatia, Group B also features defending champion Italy \u2013 all three teams are ranked in the top 10 of FIFA\u2019s world rankings \u2013 and surprise package Albania, which finished top of its qualifying group ahead of Czechia and Poland. It was an uncharacteristically sloppy start for a vastly experienced Croatia side, which has punched above its weight at international tournaments in recent years, reaching the final and then the semifinal at consecutive World Cups. The midfield trio of Luka Modri\u0107, Marcelo Brozovi\u0107\u00a0and Mateo Kova\u010di\u0107 alone boasted 372 caps for Croatia but were largely ineffective throughout. The Croatian defense was pulled apart with ease for the opening goal just before the half hour mark, allowing Morata to run through on goal from Ruiz\u2019s pass and calmly slot the ball past Dominik Livakovi\u0107. That strike moved the 31-year-old up to joint-third on the all-time scoring list at European Championships with seven goals, behind only Cristiano Ronaldo and Michel Platini. The next goal came just three minutes later as Ruiz danced around weak challenges from Modri\u0107 and Brozovi\u0107 on the edge of the area before drilling the ball low into the bottom corner. Carvajal then made it three on the stroke of half-time, timing his run perfectly to slide into the six-yard box and turn Lamine Yamal\u2019s pinpoint cross past Livakovi\u0107. Both teams had plenty of chances to add to the scoreline in the second half, but were thwarted by poor finishing and a brilliant save from Livakovi\u0107 which denied Barcelona youngster Yamal a record-breaking goal. Croatian fans thought they at least had a moment to cheer in the closing stages when Bruno Petkovi\u0107 scored at the second attempt after seeing his initial penalty saved. However, the video assistant referee (VAR) ruled that Ivan Peri\u0161i\u0107 had encroached into the area during the spot kick before he squared the ball back to Petkovi\u0107. It capped a miserable afternoon for Croatia and the team will have to improve dramatically when it faces Albania and Italy to have any hope of qualifying for the knockout stages. Italy vs. Albania Defending champion Italy had to come from a goal behind to earn an unconvincing 2-1 against win against Albania. An early Azzurri error gifted Albania the lead after just 23 seconds, as Nedim Bajrami pounced to score the fastest goal in European Championship history. However, two goals in the space of five minutes from Alessandro Bastoni and Nicol\u00f2 Barella quickly turned the game on its head and Italy was able to hold on for three important points in the \u2018Group of Death.\u2019 Though far from a vintage Italian performance, this team is vastly experienced and knows how to defend a lead and see out a game when it matters the most. Next up will be the far greater challenge of Spain when the two teams meet in a crunch clash on Thursday, with a winner guaranteed a place in the knockout stages. Italy\u2019s night got off to the worst start imaginable when Federico Dimarco\u2019s errant throw-in went straight to Bajrami\u2019s feet, allowing the forward to shift the ball to his right and hammer his effort in at the near post. But Italy found an equalizer only 10 minutes later after poor defending left Bastoni completely unmarked at the far post to head home from Lorenzo Pellegrini\u2019s cross. Barella\u2019s goal five minutes later capped a frenzied opening 15 minutes, hitting a crisp strike past goalkeeper Thomas Strakosha after the ball had bounced around inside the penalty area. The Kuqezinjt\u00eb applied plenty of pressure in the closing stages and Italy had goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma to thank for keeping out Rey Manaj\u2019s effort when the Albania forward was through on goal. It was stoic performance in the second half from Albania, the second-lowest ranked team in the tournament, and the players lined up in front of their fans to soak in the applause in what is only the country\u2019s second appearance at a European Championship. Hungary vs. Switzerland First-half goals from Kwadwo Duah and Michel Aebischer set Switzerland on course for a crucial, hard-fought 3-1 win over Hungary in Group A. Barnab\u00e1s Varga pulled a goal back for a much improved Hungary in the second half, but Breel Embolo capitalized on a defensive error to put the game beyond doubt in stoppage time. It was an uncharacteristically sloppy defensive performance from the Magyars, who qualified for Euro 2024 unbeaten after conceding just seven goals in eight games. Though the team improved as the match wore on, an experienced Swiss side weathered the storm after Varga\u2019s goal gave Hungary some momentum, before Embolo \u2013 whose thigh strapping fell off as he ran through on goal \u2013 coolly lobbed the ball over goalkeeper P\u00e9ter Gul\u00e1csi following Attila Fiola\u2019s errant header. The win puts Switzerland second in Group A behind Germany following Die Mannschaft\u2019s big 5-1 win over Scotland on Friday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/sport/euro-2024-switzerland-hungary-spain-croatia-italy-albania-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_sport_north-korea-soccer-team-inside-spt-intl", "text": "What happens within North Korea\u2019s soccer team has been kept a closely guarded secret since its creation at the end of World War II. Millions around the world caught a glimpse of the North Korean men\u2019s team in two World Cups. The Cheollima \u2013 a mythical winged horse found in East Asian mythology and featured prominently in North Korean society \u2013 beat Italy 1-0 in a stunning performance in Middlesbrough, England, in 1966. However, the team\u2019s appearance at the 2010 tournament in South Africa was far less successful, as the team lost all three of its matches, including a 7-0 shellacking by Portugal. But much like the reclusive nation itself, the team in recent years has fallen back into the shadows. Now in an exclusive interview with CNN Sport, retired North Korean midfielder An Yong Hak, who lives in Japan, has revealed what it\u2019s like to play for the team. The secrecy surrounding the North Korean national team was also evident in the case of star player Han Kwang Song. At his peak, Han was on the roster of Italian giant Juventus and featured in its U-23 side, but then he vanished from the public eye for more than three years. He had been last spotted lifting a trophy with his most recent team, Qatari club Al-Duhail, in 2020 as UN Security Council resolutions later forced the repatriation of all North Korean workers abroad. But that rapid change of fortune \u2013 from playing in top divisions in Italy and Qatar to being stuck at an embassy for the better part of three years \u2013 did not cause the striker to consider quitting soccer. Almost out of nowhere, Han publicly reappeared last November with North Korea for its World Cup qualifiers, scoring a header in a 6-1 drubbing of Myanmar. Retired North Korean midfielder An, who is now 45, laments Han being stuck in diplomatic limbo, saying it was unfortunate that the striker was unable to join Pyongyang\u2019s leading domestic club team \u2013 4.25 SC, or April 25 SC \u2013 sooner \u201cto develop at an age when he could have advanced more.\u201d \u201cHe was stuck in an embassy in China, and he had to train alone for about two to three years. Last September, I think, they let him into the country,\u201d An told CNN Sport, citing a North Korean official he spoke with. Han stayed in the embassy while the North Korean borders were shut due to the Covid-19 pandemic, An added. Born in Japan with a North Korean passport, An represented North Korea on the pitch for 10 years, a national team career which Han told An he enjoyed witnessing, according to the retired international midfielder. An recalled meeting Han for the first time in 2019 in Pyongyang, where he watched the former Cagliari striker play against South Korea, captained by Tottenham Hotspur star Son Heung-min, in a qualifier for the 2022 Qatar World Cup. After that match, An said he was waiting to fly back home to Japan and coincidentally ran into Han and two other North Korean players \u2013 Pak Kwang Ryong and Choe Song Hyok \u2013 who were playing in Austria and Italy respectively at the time. \u201c[Han] told me that he had been watching me at the stadium when I played on the national team,\u201d An said of his first interaction with the striker. An recalled telling Han and the young North Korea players, \u201cYou guys have to do well from now on, and I\u2019ll also go to Italy to cheer you guys on.\u2019\u201d \u201cYes, please come! I\u2019ll come pick you up,\u201d Han replied to An. Then in March this year \u2013 five years and one pandemic later \u2013 the two met again, this time in Tokyo, Japan. \u201cI went to the hotel [the team was staying at] a day after the game, and I told him, \u2018It\u2019s been a long time,\u2019\u201d An said. The pair talked about the previous day\u2019s 2026 World Cup qualifying match where North Korea had lost to Japan by one goal. \u201cHan\u2019s shot had hit the post and it didn\u2019t go in, so we talked about how close he was [to scoring],\u201d said An. \u201cBecause of the sanctions, Han said, \u2018I\u2019m playing in [North Korea],\u2019\u201d said An, adding that there was not much time to get into deeper conversation. He referred to Han as \u201cthe kind of talent that comes around every 10 or 20 years\u201d and as someone who had the potential to become \u201ca world-class player.\u201d \u201cI want him to be a symbol of the DPRK [North Korea] national team\u2026 I would like to see him become a player like Son Heung-min or someone of that caliber,\u201d An said of the 25-year-old Han. \u2018A hoax\u2019 Although North Korea has long isolated itself from the rest of the world, it has frequently participated in international sporting competitions, with the notable exception of during the Covid-19 pandemic. When the Cheollima ended its 2010 World Cup run \u2013 losing every group stage match, against Brazil, Portugal and Ivory Coast \u2013 rumors and reports arose that the players and coaches were subjected to punishments back in Pyongyang. Citing anonymous sources, Radio Free Asia reported that coach Kim Jong Hun was sent to do forced labor, while the players were subjected to \u201charsh ideological criticism,\u201d except An and another North Korean-Japanese striker, Jong Tae Se. CNN could not independently verify this report. An called such reports \u201ca hoax.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard to get information about DPRK, so there are still stories about people being sent to a coal mine after losing a match or being lectured for six hours, but there are no such stories at all, as far as I know,\u201d An said, denying rumors about the isolated country, citing his 10-year career of playing for the national team. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to put an end to that kind of false information,\u201d he said. Earning a spot at the 2010 World Cup marked only the second time North Korea had qualified for the world\u2019s marquee soccer competition since 1966, when the Cheollima made it to the quarterfinals, losing to Portugal 5-3. When North Korea secured its ticket to South Africa, the squad\u2019s players were acknowledged by the regime with a certificate and an apartment in Pyongyang, a rare but well-known practice by the Kim regime to reward loyalty, according to state media KCNA and verified by An. \u201cEveryone received a certificate, and we each received an apartment in Pyongyang,\u201d An said, adding that he did not get one because he is \u201cZainichi Korean.\u201d Koreans who migrated or were forced to move to Japan under colonial rule before the peninsula was divided in half are known in Japanese as \u201cZainichi Korean,\u201d including their descendants. They are eligible to apply for a North Korean passport or acquire South Korean nationality as they are not given Japanese citizenship \u2013 they are, however, legal residents in Japan and can gain citizenship through naturalization. A third generation Zainichi Korean, An holds his North Korean nationality with pride. \u201cMy grandparents kept their DPRK identity, although they could have chosen to live an easy life, so I didn\u2019t want to easily change that identity of mine,\u201d An explained, adding that he also considered South Korea his geographical home. Another Zainichi Korean on the 2010 squad was Jong Tae Se, who grabbed the world\u2019s attention as he broke down in tears during North Korea\u2019s national anthem ahead of the squad\u2019s 2-1 loss to Brazil. Jong\u2019s tears moved the fans and even An said, \u201cMany Zainichi Koreans were extremely moved by it.\u201d \u201cThis Zainichi Korean, born and raised in Japan, had a big dream and made it come true. I was able to stand side-by-side with the athletes from my home country and sing the national anthem,\u201d said An. Earning respect When An joined the North Korean national team upon receiving a call-up letter in 2002, he remembers not being immediately accepted by teammates. \u201cThe players, coaches and managers didn\u2019t know us very well. We needed to be accepted. We weren\u2019t exactly welcomed from the beginning,\u201d the retired midfielder said. North Korean players have strong bonds, as the majority of them \u2013 except for those like Han who used to play abroad and Zainichi Koreans \u2013 reside in the country, and therefore, can be called up for the national team at almost any time, according to An. To be accepted by the squad, newcomer An had to prove himself to the other North Korean players. \u201cI had to compete with the players in daily practice to win their trust and gain recognition. However, practice alone was not enough,\u201d he said. \u201cI scored two goals in a World Cup qualifying match and, by producing a result, I was accepted as a member of the national team,\u201d An said, referring to his brace in a 4-1 win against Thailand in the 2006 World Cup qualifiers. It was then that the team welcomed An wholeheartedly and the squad members became \u201clike a family\u201d to him, he said. \u201cUsually, we\u2019re apart, as I\u2019m in Japan and they are in DPRK\u2026 it is difficult to keep in touch,\u201d he said, reflecting on the unfortunate reality where he cannot even message his friends in Pyongyang. Although, as fate would have it, An met his former teammate and current manager of the North Korean national team, Sin Yong Nam, last March. Sin asked An to visit Pyongyang to share his soccer experience with young, promising talent. \u201cWhen we met again after a long time, I felt nostalgic,\u201d said An as he reflected on meeting his compatriots and former teammates after almost five years. \u201cIf another opportunity arises, I would like to return to Pyongyang and, hopefully, provide some assistance to the national team,\u201d An added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/sport/north-korea-soccer-team-inside-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_sport_usa-t20-cricket-world-cup-profile-spt-intl", "text": "One is a software engineer. Another was a mobile phone sales representative, while a third only recently quit his job as a biomedical engineer. These are some of the players that are part of the USA men\u2019s cricket team, which pulled off one of the greatest shocks in the sport\u2019s long history in beating Pakistan at the T20 World Cup, while also giving powerhouse India a bit of a fright in the group stage. And now, it will be playing in the next round of the tournament having qualified for the Super 8 stage of the T20 World Cup after its game against Ireland on Friday was abandoned.  A momentous day Born and raised in Mumbai, India, USA bowler Saurabh Netravalkar began playing cricket from an early age. Such was the promise he showed that he was selected for India\u2019s team for the Under-19 World Cup in 2010, finishing the tournament as the country\u2019s leading wicket taker. After juggling playing the sport with other commitments, Netravalkar chose to focus on cricket in an attempt to make it to the full India national team. But, as the dream to represent India appeared to be fading away, Netravalkar moved to Cornell University in New York to continue his studies in computer science, though he continued to play cricket. In 2016, he got a job at technology company Orcale in San Francisco where he has worked ever since. While he was playing at weekends for club teams, Netravalkar was still a long way from international competition; not least because the International Cricket Council\u2019s (ICC) rules at the time wouldn\u2019t have qualified him for the USA national team. \u201cI was on a student visa and then a work visa. So there was no question of playing for the team,\u201d he told the BBC. However, those rules were subsequently loosened and Netravalkar quickly established himself as a vital cog in the USA\u2019s bowling attack, being selected as the team\u2019s captain and, at the time of writing, he is the country\u2019s all-time leading wicket taker. But the highlight of his career to date came during that match against Pakistan. After the USA dragged the game against Pakistan to a Super Over and having set a competitive score of 18 runs, Netravalkar took the ball into his own hands. His combination of accuracy and variation bamboozled the Pakistani batters, limiting them to just 13 runs to secure a famous win in the USA\u2019s debut appearance at the T20 World Cup. And one of the team\u2019s key players, Aaron Jones, said that that moment was one which he and his teammates had \u201cbeen dreaming about our whole lives.\u201d \u201cTo play in a World Cup, especially in front of our home fans, and definitely to play against a full member nation and not only to play but to win against them is a great feeling,\u201d Jones told CNN\u2019s Patrick Snell. Full members\u00a0nations are the 12 governing bodies from around the world recognised by the ICC from which representative teams are qualified to play official Test matches. Jones, was born in Queens, New York, to parents from Barbados, featuring for the Caribbean island before switching allegiances to the US. Just a few days later after beating Pakistan, the USA nearly had another famous scalp too, falling just short against India. Netravalkar once again shone with the ball, picking up the invaluable wicket of Virat Kohli, widely regarded as one of the greatest batters in cricket history,\u00a0who went out facing his first ball, and then getting the wicket of India captain Rohit Sharma. Growth Netravalkar isn\u2019t the only the USA team player juggling work commitments. Veteran USA bowler Ali Khan was selling mobile phones in Dayton, Ohio, just a few years ago, while spinner Nosthush Kenjige gave up his job as a biomedical engineer to focus on his cricket. \u201cThe opportunity is more than a dream,\u201d Kenjige told USA Cricket. \u201cMy life has always revolved around cricket.\u201d The USA team boasts players with connections to India, Pakistan, South Africa and New Zealand, while its coach is Australian Stuart Law. \u2018Getting a lot of calls\u2019 The victory against Pakistan was one which not only shocked the cricketing world, but also broke through into the wider US sports discourse. Not only is the US one of the co-hosts for the T20 World Cup for the first time, but it is making its debut appearance on this stage. It comes at an important moment for the sport in the US too, with efforts being made to establish a foothold in the country in recent years. Notably, Major League Cricket (MLC) \u2013 a professional T20 league held in the US \u2013 began last year, with international stars from across the globe helping kickstart a new era for the sport in the country. Jones, who has been one of the USA\u2019s key contributors during the tournament, in particular with his 94 runs in their opening game of the World Cup against Canada, believes his team\u2019s success so far can be seed for further engagement in cricket in the country going forward. \u201cWe always want to really and truly open the eyes of Americans as it relates to cricket,\u201d the 29-year-old batter said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a big market as it relates to cricket. \u201cWe are just happy that we can play home. Playing at home is a really good thing. We\u2019ve been getting a lot of calls, a lot of messages from Americans really and truly wanting to know more about the sport and we think that\u2019s a really good thing. \u2026 I think things are just going to get bigger and better from here.\u201d Jones added: \u201cI think if I am going to explain cricket to an American is its basically baseball with different rules. But I think America is a place where people loves sports and as long as Americans really and truly follow cricket and try to get to know cricket, I think they\u2019ll enjoy it for sure and they\u2019ll give us more support for sure.\u201d Although the USA knew a win against Ireland would secure its qualification for the Super 8 stage, the match was abandoned due to wet conditions meaning its historic run at the tournament continues.

The 28-year-old,\u00a0as well as being Malian,\u00a0is a French citizen, and a multiple-platinum-selling pop star who was brought up in the Parisian suburbs. However,\u00a0ahead of Paris 2024, Nakamura finds herself at the\u00a0center\u00a0of France\u2019s culture wars. Amid widespread\u00a0rumors\u00a0the singer would\u00a0perform at the Games\u2019 Opening Ceremony, singing an Edith Piaf song,\u00a0some members of France\u2019s far-right have questioned\u00a0whether she embodies French heritage, values and identity.\u00a0Piaf is a key figure in France\u2019s musical \u2013 and national \u2013 identity. \u201cThere\u2019s no way Aya. This is Paris, not the market\u00a0in\u00a0Bamako,\u201d said fringe\u00a0and extreme\u00a0far-right group Les Natifs (Natives) on X, formerly known\u00a0as Twitter, in March, referring to Mali\u2019s capital. Nakamura has defended herself on social media, saying on X: \u201cI\u2019m becoming the number one state subject in debates\u00a0\u2026but what do I really owe you all? Nothing.\u201d The singer has received support from Rachida Dati, France\u2019s Minister of Culture, who spoke out in defence of Nakamura, saying \u201cbe careful of the pretext of attacking someone out of pure racism.\u201d Paris 2024\u2019s organizing committee told CNN: \u201cWe were very shocked by the racist attacks against Aya Nakamura in recent days. We offer our full support to the most listened-to French artist in the world.\u201d Whether Nakamura will perform at the Olympics\u2019 opening ceremony is still unconfirmed, with the Paris 2024 organizing committee telling CNN that they\u00a0\u201cwon\u2019t be confirming or denying\u201d\u00a0any rumors or reports, to \u201cleave room for surprises\u201d on the day. CNN has reached out to Nakamura but she declined to\u00a0be interviewed\u00a0on the matter. \u2018She contributes to French culture\u2019 However, many others in France are all too keen to comment on this cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. Far-right politician Marion Mar\u00e9chal,\u00a0who is the niece\u00a0of far-right National Rally party leader\u00a0Marine Le Pen and a member of the\u00a0Reconqu\u00eate\u00a0party, told French\u00a0television stations BMFTV and Europe 1\u00a0that Nakamura\u00a0\u201cdoes not sing in French,\u201d referencing the blend of Parisian and African\u00a0derived slang\u00a0that often feature in her lyrics. \u201cI think that the people who criticize her actually don\u2019t accept that she embodies France,\u201d\u00a0French activist Rokhaya Diallo told CNN. \u201cThe\u00a0slang she uses is used by young people and a lot of young French people use slang.\u201d Nakamura often uses a mix of verlan and African derived slang from languages such as Bambara, from her birth country Mali,\u00a0in her music. Her number one hit song\u00a0\u201cDjadja,\u201d\u00a0contains the lyric \u201cle monde est tit-pe\u201d \u2013 the world is small \u2013 with word \u2018tit-pe\u2019 inverting the French word \u2018petit.\u2019 Verlan, a type of French slang named after\u00a0the inversion of the French word \u2018l\u2019envers\u2019 \u2013 meaning backwards \u2013 originates from the outskirts of Paris known as \u2018la cit\u00e9\u2019 (the suburbs)\u00a0that have had\u00a0large\u00a0immigrant population. At the inauguration of the\u00a0Olympic Aquatics Centre\u00a0earlier this month, French President Emanuel Macron\u00a0said that Nakamura \u201cspeaks to a good number of our compatriots\u201d and claimed that \u201cthese\u00a0games and ceremonies should reflect us, and she contributes to French culture, to French music.\u201d \u201cI want to defend here these choices and defend the fact that there must be artistic freedom and that politics should not interfere,\u201d added Macron. In an interview with France Inter,\u00a0Macron\u2019s political rival Le Pen, known for her right-wing views, claimed that the President was seeking to \u201coutrage\u201d and \u201chumiliate the French people\u201d when asked whether she thinks Nakamura opening the games would be a\u00a0good symbol. When asked to further explain why this choice would be a humiliation, Le Pen responded \u201cshe does not sing in French, or a foreign language, she sings nonsense.\u201d Speaking to CNN, Professor of Political Science at the University of Nice,\u00a0Vincent\u00a0Martigny, said that\u00a0while\u00a0there are those who believe it is right to promote minorities and their role in French culture, there are others, who hold more traditional views, which he terms as racist in relation to the country\u2019s colonial past. 1998 World Cup There have been moments of\u00a0perceived\u00a0unity in France\u2019s past, notably when the men\u2019s national soccer team won the 1998 World Cup. That triumph helped popularise the slogan \u201cBlack, Blanc, Beur\u201d \u2013 Black, White, Arab\u00a0\u00a0\u2013\u00a0amid a push for unity and inclusion. Beur\u2019 is verlan for the French word \u2018arabe.\u2019 France\u2019s World Cup winning team of 1998\u00a0was made up of a\u00a0diverse\u00a0group\u00a0of players,\u00a0not only of European descent but also from the ex-colonies of France\u00a0and other countries.\u00a0Many thought\u00a0at the time\u00a0that the 1998 team was a sign of a truly integrated, multi-cultural France. But notable social and cultural divisions have emerged in France in recent years. There have been\u00a0multiple bans and restrictions against Islamic dress. The nationwide ban on\u00a0public\u00a0schoolchildren wearing abayas,\u00a0was\u00a0denounced as an \u201cIslamophobic campaign\u201d by\u00a0one\u00a0politician\u00a0on the left.\u00a0Athletes have been banned\u00a0from wearing a hijab while competing representing France\u00a0at the Paris\u00a0Olympic Games. Then there have been multiple protests and riots over police brutality leading to the death of\u00a0some French inhabitants of North and West African heritage\u00a0from the suburbs of Paris, fueling backlash over policing methods in marginalized communities. Nakamura\u2019s\u00a0birth\u00a0country\u00a0of Mali is one of the many\u00a0former\u00a0French colonies. There are millions of French citizens, like Nakamura, who are either themselves immigrants or descendants of immigrants from\u00a0nations formerly colonized by France. These days France\u00a0finds itself embroiled in a very public debate over the recognition and acceptance of its immigrants as the country continues to reckon with its colonial history. Professor Martigny believes that the\u00a0nationalist\u00a0party is \u201cstronger than ever\u201d and that nationalists in France are \u201cmore nationalist\u201d and more open with their views today than they were in the past. Activist Diallo also believes that France is struggling to see itself \u201cas it is\u201d and recognize non-White individuals as fully French. \u201cDespite her successes, despite her undeniable achievements, we still think that it\u2019s not an honor for us to have such a woman represent us,\u201d Diallo told CNN, referring to Nakamura. \u2018The Great Replacement\u2019 theory Political scientist Oliver Roy, who is Professor\u00a0at the EUI School of Transnational Governance, told CNN that a common belief that could be fuelling the culture wars in France is an ideology\u00a0expressed\u00a0\u201cnot just [by] the extreme right, but also part of the traditional centre right\u201d known as \u201cthe great replacement.\u201d He describes\u00a0the term\u00a0as \u201cthe idea that there is a new population coming from the south, which is replacing the old traditional, French population.\u201d However, he maintains that this fear \u201cis not supported by demography, [or] by statistics, and is, of course, very ideological.\u201d According to Martigny, France\u2019s cultural divisions are amplified on social media by both extremes of the political spectrum. \u201cBecause of the social networks, public debates are more violent on these issues than they used to be,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a theatre for the expression of extremely strong minded, sometimes racist, very often offensive comments on Twitter, on X, and on other social networks,\u201d added Martigny. \u201cYou have a lot of X accounts who are really, really, really pro far-right. And so they played a role in discussing these issues and making it a controversy. And then this controversy is exported to the traditional media.\u201d \u2018Show a very optimistic face for France\u2019 As Nakamura was targeted by fringe and extreme far-right groups as well as far-right politicians, in an interview\u00a0with BMFTV and RMC,\u00a0Macron said that \u201cthe reactions shocked me \u2026 there\u00a0were\u00a0truly racist reactions.\u201d However,\u00a0Martigny says he sees\u00a0Macron\u2019s condemnation of the attacks as racist as an attempt to balance the scales after the passing of\u00a0what the professor called\u00a0a \u201cvery restrictive law on immigration\u201d a few months ago. In December, Macron passed a controversial bill calling for tougher immigration that was endorsed by the far-right, and rejected by many in his own camp. Politicians such as Le Pen hailed the legislation as an \u201cideological victory\u201d whilst French health Minister, Aurelien Rousseau resigned in protest.\u00a0It included many amendments tightening immigration laws, one of which dictated children born to foreign parents on French soil would no longer become automatic French citizens but would have to apply for citizenship. \u201cHe needs to make that forgotten in a certain way by showing that he has a sense of balance on these issues,\u201d\u00a0Martigny states. By promoting Nakamura, Martigny believes that Macron\u2019s ambitions may have been to \u201cshow a very optimistic face for France.\u201d \u201c[There are] very strong cultural wars in France revolving around pop stars, and the type of pop stars that you can mobilize or the type of artists that you can mobilize when you want to unite the country.\u201d With less than 100 days to go until the Olympics, many hope Paris 2024 will give France the opportunity to show unity. However, the heated reactions to Nakamura hints at a more pessimistic outlook.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/26/sport/aya-nakamura-france-culture-wars-paris-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Poland took a surprise lead after only 16 minutes thanks to Adam Buksa\u2019s header, but the Netherlands deservedly leveled the scores less than 15 minutes later after Cody Gakpo\u2019s deflected shot flew past Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny. It was a closer game than perhaps many would have expected and Poland caused the Oranje problems throughout, in particular in the second half. However, without the injured Robert Lewandowski, Poland missed a number of opportunites to take the lead in the second half, allowing Netherlands substitute Weghorst to make himself the hero with practically his first touch of the game. It was another huge international goal for Weghorst, who stunned Argentina at the World Cup in 2022 with a late equalizer in the quarterfinals, as the Netherlands next face the tough test of France. After a dominant start from the Netherlands, Poland snatched the lead against the run of play through Buksa\u2019s brilliant near-post header from Piotr Zielinski\u2019s whipped corner. That was Buksa\u2019s seventh international goal in just 16 caps as he continues to be an adept deputy for injured talisman Lewandowski, who Poland is confident will be fit enough for the team\u2019s second group game against Austria. However, the Netherlands soon got the goal its early dominance deserved as Gakpo\u2019s effort from outside the area took a fortuitous deflection and wrong-footed Szcz\u0119sny in the Poland goal. Poland certainly grew into the first half, but the Netherlands will likely have been wondering how it wasn\u2019t ahead when the referee blew for half-time after Memphis Depay and Gakpo missed brilliant chances. The opening 20 minutes of the second period belonged to Poland, which must have wished that Lewandowski had been fit after squandering a number of good opportunities. The Netherlands also missed chances in the second half in a game that was largely defined by profligacy in front of goal, but Weghorst produced a moment of quality when it mattered the most, getting across his defender to turn Nathan Ake\u2019s deflected pass into the net to send the vast swathes of Dutch fans bedecked in orange shirts at Hamburg\u2019s Volksparkstadion into a frenzy. Denmark and Slovenia shared a 1-1 draw in Sunday\u2019s second match in Group C. Exactly 1,100 days after suffering a cardiac arrest at Euro 2020, Christen Eriksen produced a brilliant finish to give Denmark the lead against Slovenia, taking Jonas Wind\u2019s clever back-heel on his chest before volleying into the bottom corner. However, Erik Jan\u017ea\u2019s deflected second-half shot made it 1-1, with Benjamin\u00a0\u0160e\u0161ko impressing for Slovenia, notably hitting the post with a fierce shot.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/sport/euro-2024-netherlands-poland-slovenia-denmark-england-serbia-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_09_sport_us-sports-betting-spt-intl", "text": "It has been\u00a0an uncomfortable\u00a0few days for US sports and betting. Earlier this week,\u00a0Ippei Mizuhara, longtime interpreter of Japanese baseball star Shohei Ohtani, pleaded\u00a0guilty\u00a0in court to fraud and tax charges for stealing almost $17 million from the Los Angeles Dodgers slugger to pay off gambling debts. The hearing came on the same day that Major League Baseball (MLB) banned\u00a0San Diego Padres player Tucupita Marcano\u00a0for life after he bet on\u00a0baseball\u00a0games, as well as suspending four other players for a year for betting on games while in the minor leagues. Meanwhile, a Brooklyn man was charged with conspiring with three others to defraud a sports betting company by using inside information from\u00a0a National Basketball Association (NBA)\u00a0player to successfully bet on the performance of that player, who was later banned from the league, according to a\u00a0federal complaint\u00a0filed this week. CNN has determined the player is former\u00a0Toronto Raptors big man Jontay Porter, who was handed a lifetime ban from the NBA after an investigation found that the 24-year-old had violated betting rules. \u201cFans and consumers will put up with a lot when it comes to sports \u2013 just look at how the vast majority of off-field issues not affecting the integrity of the game tend to fade over time,\u201d\u00a0 David Carter, adjunct professor of management and organization at USC Marshall School of Business, told CNN. \u201cBut matters affecting the integrity of the game have a chilling effect across the board and governing bodies know this is their Achilles heel,\u201d he warned. \u2018Proposition betting\u2019 Experts agree that since gambling was\u00a0effectively legalized after a US Supreme Court decision in 2018 \u2013\u00a0it\u2019s now allowed in 38\u00a0states\u00a0and Washington, DC\u00a0\u2013 the industry has boomed with nearly $120 billion put down in legal sports wagers in the\u00a0US\u00a0in 2023, one analysis found. In February, when the Super Bowl was\u00a0held, Americans bet $10.49 billion on sports, a 24.8% year-over-year increase, according to the American Gaming Association\u2019s (AGA) gaming revenue tracker. \u201cYou can bet on any game anywhere, professional or amateur, and not only on the game itself, but you can bet on the individual plays in the game. And you can do it from a smartphone just by pressing some buttons,\u201d says Andrew Zimbalist, professor of economics at Smith College. The popularity of proposition betting, which focuses on individual parts or plays in a game, also opens up numerous possibilities to rig games,\u00a0according to\u00a0Zimbalist. \u201cThere are many, many more ways in which gamblers can approach players and say, \u2018Look, I don\u2019t need your team to lose,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201c\u2019All I need to do is have you not score any points in the first minute of the second half \u2026 then do whatever you want the rest of the game.\u2019\u00a0Well,\u00a0the athlete is going to feel much more protected in that circumstance than they would if they had to blow a whole game,\u201d he explains. What Zimbalist describes exemplifies the concern of some fans as to whether they can trust what they are watching. \u201cOne of the reasons why people love sports is because of the uncertainty of the competition,\u201d adds Zimbalist. \u201cThe moment the idea comes in that this is really being rigged, it\u2019s being fixed, it\u2019s being manipulated, then the interest in the sport will decline.\u201d \u2018Every point matters\u2019 In details that emerged from\u00a0the\u00a0federal complaint concerning the\u00a0alleged\u00a0illegal betting scheme involving Porter, Brooklyn man Long Phi Pham is accused of conspiring with others who bet that the player would underperform. Authorities claim that Pham and others convinced Porter, who had significant gambling debts, to withdraw early from certain games so certain bets on game activities, like how many points he scored, would be successful.\u00a0CNN has sought comment from Pham\u2019s attorney as well as from a representative for Porter. \u201cWhether on the court or in the casino, every point matters. As alleged, the defendant and his co-conspirators, as well as an NBA player, participated in a brazen, illegal betting scheme that had a corrupting influence on two games and numerous bets,\u201d US Attorney Breon Peace said in\u00a0a statement. It was in 2018 that the US Supreme Court struck down a 1992 federal law, which had prohibited most states from allowing sports betting. Fast forward to 2024 and the gambling industry is engrained in US sports culture with leagues, franchises, players and networks now partnering with betting organizations. Victor Matheson, a professor of economics at the College of the Holy Cross, says that sports betting has always happened in the US, but that illicit schemes are now being picked up now that betting is legal and sportsbooks can study their customer base and their habits. Prior to\u00a0legalization, studies \u201csuggested that maybe as many as 1% of all college basketball games were being manipulated\u201d in the US, Matheson said. \u201cSo that would suggest there were a lot of betting problems before these things became legal that we were just missing. And now because it\u2019s legal, we\u2019re catching it,\u201d he adds. However,\u00a0illegal betting has never gone away. According to the Campaign for Fairer Gambling (CFG), some $40.92 billion in illegal gross gaming revenue was generated across America\u2019s total online gambling marketplace last year. What are the leagues doing? In Zimbalist\u2019s view, leagues\u00a0are\u00a0handing\u00a0out punishments \u201cso painful and so costly\u201d that they act as deterrents like lifetime bans. In the case of\u00a0Porter, NBA commissioner Adam Silver said he was receiving the \u201cmost severe punishment\u201d in the form of his lifetime ban in order to protect the \u201cintegrity of NBA competition for our fans, our teams and everyone associated with our sport.\u201d Other leagues with shorter bans are increasing penalties: the NFL last year revised its gambling policy to raise its ban for players who bet on their own team from one to\u00a0at least\u00a0two years. Asked for comment on the issue of betting, a\u00a0spokesperson for MLB directed CNN to a statement made Tuesday by\u00a0league commissioner\u00a0Robert D. Manfred, Jr., who said:\u00a0\u201cWe have been clear that the privilege of playing in baseball comes with a responsibility to refrain from engaging in certain types of behavior that are legal for other people. \u201cSince the Supreme Court decision opened the door to legalized sports betting, we have worked with licensed sports betting operators and other third parties to put ourselves in a better position from an integrity perspective through the transparency that a regulated sports betting system can provide. \u201cMLB will continue to invest heavily in integrity monitoring, educational programming and awareness initiatives with the goal of ensuring strict adherence to this fundamental rule of our game.\u201d CNN has reached out to the NFL and NBA for further comment on how they intend to protect the integrity of their leagues. \u2018Players involved are extremely low profile\u2019 Zimbalist and Matheson note\u00a0that\u00a0it\u2019s unlikely that US sports\u2019 biggest stars would\u00a0become embroiled in betting schemes because they are already paid tens of millions of dollars a year. \u201cThe actual players involved are extremely low profile. These are not LeBron\u00a0James, Patrick Mahomes. These are not the Connor McDavid\u2019s of the world,\u201d Matheson explains. Zimbalist adds that \u201cmediocre\u201d or newer, less established players on a lower salary might be more susceptible to agreeing to rig a game. \u201cThat person is much more likely to feel aggrieved and taken advantage of and hence be more susceptible.\u201d Carter also points out that governing bodies are working with tech companies in order to better catch illicit schemes. \u201cLeagues and governing bodies are doing as much as they can; especially when attempting to balance revenue generation, league policy, and external relations. Sometimes it seems similar to the IRS \u2013 just as one (sports gambling) loophole or workaround is shut down, another arises,\u201d he adds. However, as Zimbalist points out,\u00a0TV broadcasts for sports\u00a0have become so mainstream that fans can\u2019t watch games or read game reports without being bombarded with advertisements from sports books. Problem gambling Meanwhile research suggests\u00a0that individuals in the US with gambling disorders have\u00a0the \u201chighest suicide rate of any addiction disorder.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think we have the resources, the educational systems in place now,\u201d says Zimbalist. \u201cWe need legislation to do things like prevent sports betting advertising, and to prevent prop betting. We need some kinds of constraints, because the problem is much too big to just let the marketplace take over and people become more and more addicted or hooked on gambling.\u201d A 2023 NCAA study surveyed young adults aged 18-22, finding that among those who had seen sports gambling advertisements, 58% said it made them more likely to want to gamble. Among higher risk gamblers, about 80%\u00a0say the ads they have seen make them more likely to gamble. It\u2019s estimated that 2.5 million adults in the US \u201cmeet the criteria for a severe gambling problem in a given year,\u201d according to the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG). However, it\u00a0can be often\u00a0in leagues\u2019 financial interest for betting to increase in popularity.\u00a0For example, the NFL made over $130 million\u00a0last\u00a0year alone in gambling sponsorship deals. That\u2019s more than 5% of the league\u2019s total sponsorship revenue. \u201cThe sports leagues have turned to sports betting because it increases fan avidity. More fans will watch more games when people are betting on it and pay more attention to the news, talk more about the games,\u201d Zimbalist says. \u201cLeagues also make deals with sports books where they sell them data so they can have enough instantaneous data betting play after play \u2013 they take the share of the total amount that\u2019s bet, they charge fees. \u201cThe sports industry looks at these developments, unfortunately, as salutary for their economic health, at least in the short run and generates more revenue. And because then, because the overwhelming drive in these leaks is economic \u2014 owners want to make money and they want the value of franchises to go up,\u201d he adds.

{"id": "2024_06_03_sport_fan-caddie-injured-pan-canadian-open-spt-intl", "text": "Soaking up the thrilling climax of the RBC Canadian Open, Paul Emerson wove his way through the crowds to get a good view of the PGA Tour stars on the fourth hole. A few bizarre developments later, he was working for one of them. For two fleeting but fairy tale holes on Sunday, self-professed \u201cgolf nut\u201d Emerson was the star of the show at Ontario\u2019s Hamilton Golf and Country Club, as an injury to C.T. Pan\u2019s caddie Mike \u201cFluff\u201d Cowan presented an impromptu opportunity for one local fan to man the bag at his country\u2019s national open. With Cowan unable to continue after tripping and falling on the third fairway, Taiwan\u2019s Pan saw his clubs picked up by Dan Reynolds, caddie for Irish playing partner Shane Lowry. World No. 33 Lowry had been hauling his own bag as Pan helped Cowan in the direction of medical support, limping past one eager-to-assist spectator in a red Masters T-shirt en route. \u201cWe heard a big tumble and a big sound when Fluff wiped out,\u201d Emerson, a lawyer from nearby Aurora, Ontario, told the PGA Tour. \u201cI just simply offered. I said \u2026 do you need any help?\u201d he told CNN\u2019s \u201cNews Central\u201d on Monday. \u201c(Pan) said yes. And then next thing you know, I\u2019m helping Fluff takeoff the bib and walking up the fairway. It just all happened very fast.\u201d Heart racing, Emerson shook hands with Lowry before throwing the bag over his shoulder \u2013 unprecedented scenes that had not escaped the lenses of TV broadcasters. It was a dream start. Emerson was one-under through one hole for his PGA Tour career after Pan curled home a brilliant birdie putt from just over 20 feet, prompting the 2020 Olympic bronze medalist to toast his new ally with a shout of \u201cgreat caddie\u201d as he plucked his ball from the cup. \u201cOne for one, Paul!\u201d Lowry quipped, adding with a laugh: \u201cIt\u2019s all downhill from here.\u201d Emerson told CNN he had a chance to relax on the next tee. \u201cI just sort of soaked it up and we actually started joking around,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was all very, very friendly and fun.\u201d \u2018I didn\u2019t really want to stop\u2019 With his phone now buzzing incessantly in his pocket, Emerson took the walk up the subsequent fairway as an opportunity to ask Pan what he required. There was only one request: \u201cStay off the greens.\u201d \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m not very chatty\u2019\u201d Emerson recalled to the PGA Tour. \u201cI was like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019ll talk as much or as little as you want. \u201cHe\u2019s a really nice guy \u2013 really friendly.\u201d When asked by CNN whether he gave Pan advice, Emerson chuckled. \u201cThat would be a terrible decision on his part to ask me for guidance,\u201d he said. \u201cMy job was fairly clear, just carry the bag and keep his clubs dry.\u201d Lowry\u2019s tongue-in-cheek jibe was not entirely inaccurate, as Pan bogeyed the par-five hole. The following fairway would mark the end of the road for Emerson\u2019s caddie cameo, as a member of the caddie services team \u2013 Michael Campbell \u2013 arrived to take over from an accepting, albeit reluctant, Emerson. \u201cI said to C.T., \u2018Well, this is your decision,\u2019\u201d added Emerson, whose only previous caddying experience had been for a golfer at a Canadian Women\u2019s Open Pro-Am event. \u201cI didn\u2019t really want to stop, but he took the person who has some local knowledge.\u201d Pan had just made back-to-back birdies when he greeted his fourth bagman of the round, Al Riddell, at the 10th tee. Riddell, who had caddied for France\u2019s Paul Barjon until he missed the cut, had the best possible view of Pan\u2019s stunning eagle \u2013 a 121-yard effort that spun back into the cup \u2013 at the 12th hole. World No. 133 Pan, a one-time winner on the PGA Tour, carded a final round one-under 69 amid damp conditions to finish in tied-35th at three-under overall, 13 shots behind champion Robert MacIntyre. Cowan, 76, was treated for \u201cnonserious\u201d injuries at the clubhouse, a PGA Tour official told ESPN. CNN has reached out to the PGA Tour for an update on Cowan. The Caddie Open Quizzed on his plans for the rest of Sunday, Emerson said he was considering a shirt change to help allay the attention he was receiving around Hamilton Country Club. Yet come the end of Sunday, he had a strong rival for the title of most famous emergency caddie. Having parted ways with his bagman just a week ago, homesick MacIntyre had called on the services of his 59-year-old father Dougie, head greenskeeper at a club back home in Oban, Scotland. The duo dovetailed seamlessly as 27-year-old MacIntyre held off a flurry of big-name stars to clinch his first PGA Tour title, stamping his ticket to the US Open later this month and a $1.69 million prize check he said would go toward paying off his parent\u2019s mortgage. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. I\u2019m a grass cutter not a caddie,\u201d MacIntyre senior, wiping away tears, told CBS Sports. \u201cLast Saturday night, I\u2019m sitting on the couch at home and I\u2019m (thinking), \u2018Can I leave my job here? I\u2019m busy at work.\u2019 Eight o\u2019clock the next morning, I\u2019m on a flight out here and wow.\u201d The Canadian Open is building a reputation for throwing up storylines both beautiful and bizarre. At last year\u2019s tournament, home hero Nick Taylor ended the 69-year wait for a men\u2019s Canadian golfer to win their home open with a remarkable 72-foot eagle putt, only for friend and fellow pro Adam Hadwin to be mistakenly tackled by a security guard amid the ensuing bedlam. Hadwin laughed off the case of mistaken identity soon after, and reconnected with his former feller at this year\u2019s tournament, posting a selfie of the duo smiling to X with the caption: \u201cWater under the bridge!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/sport/fan-caddie-injured-pan-canadian-open-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "sports"}}

The 30-year-old US golfer might be holding a one-shot lead atop the leaderboard at the US Open, but he gives a spectator a ball and signs his hat before high-fiving a row of on-lookers. DeChambeau looks to be a different man from a few years ago. There was a widely-held perception that the golfer was a highly-strung, uber-competitor, whose desire to win often grated on his rivals. Fast forward to 2024 and DeChambeau looks a lot more comfortable in his skin. That change has seemingly paid huge dividends, with the 30-year-old claiming his second major title over the weekend, winning the US Open at Pinehurst in North Carolina. He did so in spectacular fashion as he held off Rory McIlroy\u2019s challenge and hit a crucial bunker shot on the final hole to leave him a simple putt to clinch the title. DeChambeau called his bunker effort \u201cpossibly my best golf shot of my entire life.\u201d DeChambeau 2:0 is the result of a \u201clot of personal growth,\u201d according to the golfer. \u201c2022 was a rock-bottom year for me and pushed me to be the person I am today. I\u2019ve got a lot of people that have stuck around me from 2022 which has allowed me to be the person I\u2019ve grown to be now and I can\u2019t thank them enough because without them, I wouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d DeChambeau told CNN\u2019s Patrick Snell. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long road but I\u2019m certainly very blessed and thankful to have those individuals sticking with me and continuing to push me forward.\u201d That low point in his life in 2022 coincided with his controversial move to the Saudi-backed LIV Golf as well as his injury struggles. A loss of form resulted in DeChambeau tumble down the world rankings as he struggled with his game to leave him a \u201cpretty deep hole.\u201d \u201cGolf swing wasn\u2019t doing well. Ball striking was terrible. Putting wasn\u2019t great,\u201d he remembers. But, through the help and support of the people around him and hard work on the course, DeChambeau\u2019s 2024 has something of a annus mirabilis. Before appearing at Pinehurst, he had engineered successful appearances at this year\u2019s majors, finishing tied-sixth at The Masters and second at the PGA Championship. The best was still to come though, as DeChambeau showed grit and resilience to claim his second US Open title, all the while showing his appreciation for the support he got over the four days in North Carolina. \u201cMy mission is to continue to expand the game, grow the game globally, domestically. YouTube has really helped me accomplish some of that,\u201d DeChambeau told reporters afterwards. \u201cConsequently I think people have seen who I am on YouTube, which has been fantastic, \u2018cause then I get to play off of it. It just feeds itself out here. \u201cThey just say things that make me interact and engage. When is the next junior club set coming out? \u201cIt\u2019s direct conversations to people that truly engage with what I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s such an awesome, awesome platform for me to show who I truly am.\u201d DeChambeau\u2019s YouTube channel currently has over 700,000 subscribers. He posts educational golf videos, while others are more humorous or involve challenges he tries to complete. He added: \u201cFrom my perspective, I\u2019m just passionate. I really care about doing well out here and showing the fans a side of me that was locked up for so long.\u201d A special day Not only did Sunday\u2019s victory have DeChambeau back in the winner\u2019s circle at a majora for the first time in four years, but it also came on a particularly poignant day for the US golfer. The tournament\u2019s final round fell on Father\u2019s Day \u2013 his dad, Jon, passed away in 2022 and DeChambeau admitted that that memory loomed large on Sunday. \u201cAll day,\u201d DeChambeau told CNN\u2019s Patrick Snell when asked whether he felt Jon\u2019s presence with him during Sunday\u2019s action. \u201cThere were numerous times on 2, 3, 4, even 5 where I was just walking down the fairway thinking about him.\u201d And afterwards, DeChambeau dedicated his US Open victory to his dad. \u201cThis one is for him,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/sport/bryson-dechambeau-reinvention-dad-us-open-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "sports"}}

The medal was reassigned to France after the IOC concluded that its recipient, British cyclist Lloyd Hildebrand, was competing as part of a French club at a time when medal attribution did not strictly depend on citizenship. Born in 1870 in Tottenham, London, Hildebrand spent most of his life in France and died in 1924 in the Parisian suburb of Levallois-Perret. He finished second in the men\u2019s 25 kilometer cycling race at the Paris Summer Games in 1900. \u201cEven though Hildebrand was a British citizen, he was born and brought up in France, and competed for a French club before and after Paris 1900,\u201d the IOC said in a statement. Back in 1900, many National Olympic Committees (NOCs) did not yet exist and athletes were instead attached to the sport federation of whichever country they were based in, regardless of their citizenship. Any medals they won were thus attributed to that nation. \u201cAthletes had only to send the number of their license, established by the national federation where they were regularly competing,\u201d the IOC explained in their statement. \u201cNational Olympic Committees were not involved in the process, as they are today,\u201d the IOC added. St\u00e9phane Gachet, a French sports author who researched Hildebrand\u2019s background, had written to the IOC on March 30 this year to request the change, copying in French President Emmanuel Macron as well as France\u2019s sports minister Am\u00e9lie Oud\u00e9a-Cast\u00e9ra. \u201cThe rule that athletes must be registered for the Games by their country of nationality only appeared in 1920,\u201d Gachet said. \u201cDuring the earlier period, registration procedures were more informal and managed by the clubs, especially before 1908,\u201d he added. Gachet is a specialist when it comes to French Olympic medals, having published the Dictionary of French Olympics Medalists in 2011. Hildebrand had always competed under the banner of the Club des Sports, a sporting society based in Levallois-Perret, where the cyclist lived, according to Gachet\u2019s research and French archives. \u201c124 years later, at my request, the IOC Executive Board today approved the reallocation to France of the silver medal won by Lloyd Hildebrand at the Paris 1900 Olympic Games. Immense joy!\u201d Gachet said in a post on X. Team GB also reacted to the news, with a British Olympic Association spokesperson telling CNN Sport: \u201cWe were aware of the change of status for the medal and have ourselves benefited in such circumstances before.\u201d \u201cWe shall try to win one back later this summer!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/sport/france-awarded-olympic-medal-given-to-great-britain-in-1900/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "sports"}}

First reported in the Guardian on Tuesday, the chief of police in Gelsenkirchen, the city where England plays Serbia, said they are expecting up to 500 hooligans to try and cause violence. \u201cOfficers from the UK have a good working relationship with the German Police, developed from working together on a number of previous high-profile football tournaments and matches in the past,\u201d the UK\u2019s Football Policing Unit told CNN in a statement. \u201cWe are continuing to work closely with German police to support a safe and trouble-free Euro 2024 tournament for travelling England fans.\u201d Up 40,000 England fans and 8,000 Serbia fans are expected to travel to Gelsenkirchen for a game UEFA, European football\u2019s governing body, and German police have designated as \u201chigh-risk.\u201d In total, some 300,000 England fans are expected to travel to Germany during the tournament. CNN understands the British police have around 2,000 banning orders currently in place for fans. German police told CNN in a statement that they are \u201cpreparing for the possibility of violent hooligans being present in the city area\u201d but added they \u201ccurrently have no information that would confirm this.\u201d \u201cThe upcoming football match between Serbia and England is defined as a high-risk match. Accordingly, we will be deploying more personnel than for less critical matches. The Gelsenkirchen police will be supported by police forces from the entire state of North Rhine-Westphalia. \u201cThe Gelsenkirchen police are in close contact with the English and Serbian authorities as part of their preparations. Communication with the English police in particular is excellent, with a constant exchange of information regarding disruptive events.\u201d The Serbian Football Federation and the Serbian Ministry of Interior did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. At Euro 2016 in France, England\u2019s opening match against Russia in Marseille was marred by violence between both sets of fans, leading to multiple injuries and arrests. An estimated 2.7 million people are expected to visit Germany for Euro 2024, according to Reuters, with large fan zones set up across all major cities. Euro 2024 gets underway on Friday when host Germany faces Scotland. The host It\u2019s fair to say expectations for the German national team are not high within the host country. Poor form and performances led to the federation sacking head coach Hansi Flick in September 2023 and bringing in Julian Nagelsmann. Even now, it continues to be a bumpy ride for the former Bayern Munich coach Nagelsmann; recent impressive wins away to France and at home to the Netherlands were preceded by defeats in Austria and at home to Turkey. But some German fans are now dreaming of a second \u2018Sommerm\u00e4rchen,\u2019 or \u2018summer fairytale,\u2019 a term given to the summer of 2006 when Germany unexpectedly reached the semifinals for the World Cup on home soil when expectations were similarly low. However, a recent poll conducted by national broadcaster ARD found that 27% of Germans had no interest in Euro 2024. Only 43% said they are very interested. Germany has a rich history in major tournaments, winning four World Cups and three European Championships, but success recently has been harder to come by. The national team hasn\u2019t won a knockout match at a major tournament in almost eight years, getting knocked out at the group stages of the two previous World Cups and losing in the round of 16 at Euro 2020. With the weight of expectation lifted, however, perhaps another \u2018Sommerm\u00e4rchen\u2019 is a distinct possibility. The favorites France and England go into the tournament as the two favorites to lift the \u2018Henri Delaunay Cup.\u2019 Les Bleus have been one of the dominant forces in world football in recent years, winning the World Cup in 2018 and reaching the final in 2022. The last time out in the Euros, however, France was stunned on penalties by Switzerland in the round of 16. Didier Deschamps has been in charge of the national team since 2012 and last January extended his contract until 2026. Deschamps, who captained France to glory at the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000, also guided the team to victory in the 2020-21 Nations League and the final of Euro 2016. The current squad boasts an absurd amount of talent, with the experience of Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, Olivier Giroud and Antoine Griezmann supported by the newest crop of stars. Bradley Barcola, Warren Za\u00efre-Emery and Eduardo Camavinga are just some of the gifted youngsters produced by France\u2019s seemingly never-ending conveyor belt of talent. \u201cI want to win the Euros. I have to be honest. I won the World Cup. I won the Nations League. That\u2019s the only one that missed me with the national team after I did everything with the national team,\u201d Mbapp\u00e9 told CNN recently. \u201cI really want to win this. My first competition as captain, so it\u2019s really important for me and it\u2019s always important for the country and we want them to be proud of us. [It\u2019s] another opportunity to write the history of my country.\u201d England\u2019s current national team is similarly awash with talent \u2013 if not more so \u2013 and will rightly feel confident of ending 58 years of heartbreak since it last won a major trophy at the 1966 World Cup. Harry Kane remains one of the world\u2019s best strikers and he will be supported by an all-star cast that features Phil Foden, Bukayo Saka and Declan Rice, while Jude Bellingham\u2019s emergence as one of the world\u2019s best young players adds an extra dimension to England\u2019s midfield. Manager Gareth Southgate has now been in charge for eight years and has enjoyed more success than any of his predecessors since that sole World Cup win. During his tenure, England has reached the World Cup semifinals and  Euro 2020 final but has so far been unable to end the national team\u2019s barren run. Southgate\u2019s contract runs out in December and the English Football Association is reportedly keen to extend it, but the Englishman told CNN last month the decision \u201cwill be mine.\u201d \u201cOf course, we got so close in the last Euros,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cWe were one penalty away, one goal not conceded away from being European champions anyway. So, the players know how close we are. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve been that close \u2026 in the end, you need to take that final step.\u201d The dark horses Hungary has been tipped by many as the dark horse of the tournament after qualifying for its third consecutive European Championship. Led by Liverpool midfielder Dominik Szoboszlai, who will become the youngest captain in Euros history in Germany, this impressive Hungary side went through qualifying unbeaten and conceded just seven goals in eight matches. The team also came second in its Nations League group that also featured Italy, Germany and England, conceding just five goals in six games. Defence, clearly, will be the key to any Hungarian success at Euro 2024. \u201cI don\u2019t have expectations of anyone or the team,\u201d Szoboszlai told UEFA. \u201cWe know exactly what we are capable of; we know what we have achieved so far against other national teams. \u201cI don\u2019t want to burden the team, and I don\u2019t want the outside world to burden us. But if we feel pressure, we can help each other enjoy the EURO. \u201cIt\u2019s not a small thing to be there. However, we do have a very good team. It\u2019s like a big family, and together we can do anything.\u201d Ukraine, appearing in the country\u2019s fourth straight Euros, also has the chance to make waves in Germany after a solid qualifying campaign. The team narrowly missed out on automatic qualification after losing out on head-to-head with Italy, but battled through tough playoff games against Bosnia and Herzegovina and Iceland, winning both matches 2-1 to reach the finals. Each victory is especially significant against the backdrop of Russia\u2019s ongoing war in Ukraine; this is the first major tournament Ukraine has qualified for since the invasion began. With players such as Oleksandr Zinchenko, Andriy Lunin and Mykhailo Mudryk playing for some of Europe\u2019s biggest clubs, plus the emergence of Artem Dovbyk as the most prolific striker in Spain, Ukraine should feel confident of at least progressing from a forgiving group that features Belgium, Slovakia and Romania.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/sport/euro-2024-england-serbia-hooligan-fears-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_sport_sports-betting-gambling-professional-athletes-dg", "text": "As the sports betting industry continues to rake in record-breaking revenue, a growing number of professional athletes have become entangled in gambling scandals and gambling addiction helplines are reporting a rise in calls and text messages from people asking for help. Earlier this month, Major League Baseball (MLB) banned San Diego Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano for betting on games. The National Basketball Association (NBA) banned Toronto Raptors player Jontay Porter ahead of the 2024 playoffs for violating betting rules. MLB also issued one-year suspensions to four other players. These are the latest in a series of gambling violations among pro athletes in recent years, after the US Supreme Court cleared the way for states to legalize sports betting\u00a0in 2018. Although leagues had historically opposed it, betting has become increasingly ingrained in US sports culture. \u201cThe longstanding prohibition against betting on Major League Baseball games by those in the sport has been a bedrock principle for over a century.\u00a0We have been clear that the privilege of playing in baseball comes with a responsibility to refrain from engaging in certain types of behavior that are legal for other people,\u201d MLB Commissioner Robert Manfred said when Marcano\u2019s ban was announced. As pro athletes deal with the ramifications of betting on games, a growing number of people are also grappling with mental health issues associated with sports betting. Gambling addiction hotlines across the country have reported a huge surge in traffic in recent years. Texts and chats to the National Problem Gambling Helpline have increased around 800% since 2018 while call volume grew nearly 80%. The national helpline received nearly 359,000 calls and messages last year. But that figure doesn\u2019t offer a complete picture of the requests for help. The national helpline is not able to break out what share of incoming traffic is related to sports betting. State helplines, however, experienced similar upswings after their states approved sports gambling. Calls and messages to the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey, for example, increased 277% from fiscal year 2018 \u2014 when the state first\u00a0legalized sports betting \u2014  to 2022. The Problem Gambling Network of Ohio recorded a 66% surge in call volume in 2023, the first year of legalized sports betting in the state. The annual national social cost of problem gambling \u2014 including job loss and gambling-related criminal justice \u2014 amounts to around $14 billion, according to the National Council on Problem Gambling. An estimated 2.5 million adults in the US \u201cmeet the criteria for a severe gambling problem in a given year.\u201d As more\u00a0people reach out for help, however, the sports betting industry is seeing profits skyrocket. Sports gambling revenue grew from $7.6 billion in 2022 to $11 billion in 2023, according to the American Gaming Association. The first quarter of this year alone brought in $3.33 billion \u2014 a 22% annual increase over the first quarter of 2023. Prior to the Supreme Court decision, Nevada was the only state where sports betting was legal. Now, gamblers can bet on sports legally in 38 states plus\u00a0Washington, DC, according to the American Gaming Association. There\u2019s been an explosion of advertising for sports betting companies in arenas and during broadcasts of games, like the Super Bowl, which feature celebrity sponsors and athletes. Leagues, franchises and networks have also started partnering with betting companies. NBA star LeBron James, for example, became a \u201ctalent ambassador\u201d for Draft Kings \u2014 a popular digital sports betting company \u2014 earlier this year, and ESPN launched an official sports betting platform in 2023. The explosive growth of sports betting has some concerned about gambling and addiction. Despite signing a bill legalizing sports betting in Massachusetts in 2022, former Gov. Charlie Baker \u2014 who is now the president of the National Collegiate Athletic Association \u2014 reportedly said he wished\u00a0\u201csports betting had just stayed in Las Vegas\u201d at a convention in the city this week.\u00a0In January,\u00a0Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Rep. Andrea Salinas introduced the Gambling Addiction Recovery, Investment, and Treatment Act, which would use federal funding to treat and study problem gambling.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/sport/sports-betting-gambling-professional-athletes-dg/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_09_sport_french-open-final-mens-final-2024-spt-intl", "text": "Carlos Alcaraz won his third grand slam title and first at the French Open on Sunday, defeating Alexander Zverev 6-3 2-6 5-7 6-1 6-2 in an engrossing contest. With the victory, the 21-year-old Alcaraz becomes the youngest man to claim a grand slam title on every surface having won the US Open in 2022 and Wimbledon last year. He came through a tense match against Zverev on Court Philippe-Chatrier to add to his collection of trophies, rallying from two sets to one down in impressive fashion. In windy conditions, the Spaniard showcased his fearless brand of tennis in front of a lively Parisian crowd. Having saved multiple break points to maintain the lead in the deciding set, he went a double break ahead before serving out for the victory in four hours and 19 minutes, sinking to the floor and punching his fists in delight. Alcaraz remains unbeaten in grand slam finals and is the youngest man to triumph at the French Open since compatriot Rafael Nadal won the third of his 14 singles titles in 2007. \u201cThe crowd has been great (for me) from the first match until today,\u201d Alcaraz said in his on-court interview, having thanked his team and family. \u201cI just have good words for you guys for the support I\u2019ve received, not only in matches but in practices \u2026 You\u2019ve made this tournament so special.\u201d After Iga Swiatek won the women\u2019s singles title in straight sets on Saturday, this was a much tighter affair as momentum swung to and from each player throughout. The pair exchanged breaks in a nervy start to the match before Alcaraz gained the upper hand with a break at 2-2. He proceeded to wrap up the set with a thumping forehand winner, but from there Zverev upped his intensity and produced much better tennis in the second set. The German, aiming to win his first grand slam title having lost to Dominic Thiem in five sets in the 2020 US Open final, had an 83% first-serve success rate in the second set as he leveled the match having gone a double break ahead. It looked as though Alcaraz had regained control of the match in the third set when he saved three break points to move into a 5-2 lead. Suddenly, however, his play dipped and Zverev came roaring back, winning the next five games to lead for the first time in the match. The world No. 3 needed to respond and did so in style. An outrageous whipped forehand handed Alcaraz a 2-0 lead in the fourth set before a well-executed drop shot engineered another break of Zverev\u2019s serve two games later. An exchange of breaks followed either side of a medical timeout for Alcaraz, who then held his serve to force a decider. This was just the second time since 2005 that the men\u2019s French Open final had gone to five sets, and a string of unforced errors from Zverev \u2013 including a double fault \u2013 was a sign that the pressure was starting to take its toll. Having moved up a break, Alcaraz then had to dig himself out of a 0-40 hole the following game to maintain the advantage. The finish line in sight, a stunning backhand passing shot helped him on the way to another break, and from there winning a third grand slam title \u2013 on hard courts, grass, and now clay \u2013 was only a formality. Zverev had his best-ever run at the French Open against the backdrop of an assault case, which, on Friday, a Berlin court announced that he and his former partner had agreed to settle with no admission of guilt from Zverev. Asked about the settlement prior to the final, the World No. 4 said that he was \u201chappy that it\u2019s over\u201d but didn\u2019t \u201cever want to hear another question about the subject again.\u201d He had to come through two five set matches \u2013 against Tallon Griekspoor and Holger Rune \u2013 in his run to the final, as well as recovering from a set down against Casper Ruud in the semifinals. Alcaraz, by contrast, had spent less time on court than his opponent, despite carrying an arm injury prior to this year\u2019s French Open. He improves his record in five-set matches to 11 wins and only one loss \u2013 a remarkable statistic for such a young player. One of those marathon wins was against Australian Open champion and soon-to-be world No. 1 Jannik Sinner in the semifinal, making Alcaraz the first man in the Open Era to win the final and the semifinal of the French Open in five sets. He may not have been at his best throughout the final against Zverev \u2013 hitting 56 unforced errors alongside 52 winners \u2013 but his latest grand slam triumph was further evidence that Alcaraz thrives when playing under enormous pressure in high-stakes matches. This was another milestone performance in what looks likely to be a remarkable tennis career.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/sport/french-open-final-mens-final-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "sports"}}

{"id": "2024_06_17_sport_nba-finals-celtics-mavericks-game-5-spt-intl", "text": "The Boston Celtics remain one game away from a record 18th NBA championship, though the Dallas Mavericks will do everything to stop them from getting there. After leaping to a controlling 3-0 series lead in the NBA Finals, the Celtics missed the chance to complete the sweep in Game 4 as the Mavericks finally got on the board in the best-of-seven series with a 122-84 victory to force a Game 5. With the Finals now heading back to Boston, the Celtics will be looking to close things out in front of their home fans. Dallas, meanwhile, face a seemingly impossible task \u2013 no team in NBA history has ever recovered from a 0-3 deficit to win a playoff series. A total of 156 teams have taken a 3-0 lead in the postseason, and those teams have gone on to win the series every time. History is clearly not on the Mavericks\u2019 side, but they are not losing hope just yet. \u201cThe most important thing is to show that we believe,\u201d said superstar guard Luka Don\u010di\u0107, per the Mavericks. \u201cI think we showed it in Game 4. If not, if we wouldn\u2019t believe, we probably wouldn\u2019t have won that game.\u201d How to watch Game 5 Game 5 tips off at 8:30 p.m. ET on Monday at TD Garden in Boston, Massachusetts. Fans will be able to keep up with all the action on ABC in the United States. Championship dreams Across the entire season, the Celtics have looked every bit the championship favorites that many touted them to be. Dominance has been a theme of Boston\u2019s quest for banner No. 18. They finished with a league-best 64-18 regular season record \u2013 which clinched homecourt advantage throughout the postseason \u2013 and have rarely looked like being challenged in the playoffs, only dropping three games coming into Game 5. After losing in the Finals to the Golden State Warriors in 2022 and being upset in the Eastern Conference Finals by the Miami Heat last year, the Celtics made a couple of big swings last offseason to construct a fearsome five-man unit. Multiple-time All-Stars Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is (formerly a Maverick) were acquired via trade, with the latter\u2019s recent return from injury proving to be a big boost for Boston. The pair are accompanied by overqualified role-player Derrick White, but it is the Celtics\u2019 star wing duo of Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown who are the true difference makers. Both are contenders for Finals MVP, but will be looking to bounce back from a sluggish Game 4 in Dallas in which they combined for only 25 points. \u201cWe are at the precipice of completing what we set out to do at the beginning of the season,\u201d Brown said ahead of Game 5, per the Celtics. \u201cJust need to remind everybody that it\u2019s just one possession at a time. We do it together and we fight like our lives depend on it, and I think we\u2019ll be all right.\u201d Despite missing out on the sweep on Friday, the Celtics are looking forward to getting back in front of their home fans. \u201cI think [TD Garden is] going to be as loud as it\u2019s ever been in my seven years of being a Celtic,\u201d said Tatum. \u2018You\u2019ve got to give everything you have\u2019 It has been a disappointing series for Dallas, with hope of a second championship in franchise history appearing to slip away. After battling through a loaded Western Conference to become the second-ever No.5 seed to make the Finals, the Mavericks have often looked simply outgunned by the Celtics. Don\u010di\u0107 \u2013 who finished third in MVP voting \u2013 has been typically dominant on the offensive end but has faced criticism for not offering enough on the other side of the ball. Meanwhile, his co-star Kyrie Irving has struggled to find offensive consistency against the team that he left in acrimonious circumstances in 2019. \u201cWhen the fans are cheering, \u2018Kyrie sucks,\u2019 they feel like they have a psychological edge, and that\u2019s fair,\u201d said Irving, per the Mavs. \u201cOf course, if I\u2019m not making shots or turning the ball over, that makes it even more of a pressing issue that they can stay on me for. \u201cI think in order to silence even the self-doubt \u2014 let alone the crowd doubt \u2014 but the self-doubt when you make or miss shots, that\u2019s just as important as making sure I\u2019m leading the team the right way.\u201d The Mavericks have left themselves with a mountain to climb in the series but the morale-boosting victory in Game 4 was a positive start. The players are fully aware of the situation they\u2019re in as they attempt to make history. \u201cI think obviously the talk is easy to talk about it, but then showing it is another thing,\u201d said Don\u010di\u0107. \u201cEvery team plays the whole season to be here. We are the one to be here in Boston, obviously, so it\u2019s a little bit different. But you\u2019ve got to play basketball. You\u2019ve got to give everything you have.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/sport/nba-finals-celtics-mavericks-game-5-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_sport_ukraine-euro-2024-sergiy-rebrov-spt-intl", "text": "When Ukraine\u2019s players step out on the field to play Romania in their opening group game of Euro 2024, they will do so with more than just sporting glory at stake. In the harrowing years that have followed Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the besieged nation\u2019s soccer team has become a beacon of hope for a country still suffering under the weight of war. It\u2019s a responsibility that the team takes very seriously and one which it will use as motivation at this year\u2019s European Championship \u2013 the first major tournament Ukraine has qualified for since the war began in 2022. \u201cWe all understand that football is not the most important thing now in Ukraine,\u201d Ukraine head coach Sergiy Rebrov tells CNN Sport. \u201cBut I think our successful performance in Europe gives our people in Ukraine positive emotions. \u201cBefore [the war], when you\u2019re fighting on the pitch, you are thinking only about the result. But I think all of us now are thinking about the result and about showing Europe the real character of our country.\u201d Ukraine finished third in its Euro 2024 qualifying group, behind England and Italy, but beat Bosnia-Herzegovina and then Iceland in a tense playoff campaign to qualify for the major tournament. After securing its place in the competition back in March, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked the team for \u201cproving once again that when it is difficult for Ukrainians, but they do not give up and continue to fight.\u201d Rebrov also said the team received happy messages from soldiers on the frontline, who said how proud they were of the achievement. Ukraine will now have the chance to provide another morale boost for the nation as it tests itself against Europe\u2019s elite, first facing Romania on Monday before playing Belgium and Slovakia in its remaining Group E games. Rebrov, who became a popular figure in Ukrainian soccer as a player, took over as head coach of the national team in 2023 and has overseen the development of an exciting group of players, led by the likes of Chelsea star Mykhailo Mudryk and Arsenal\u2019s Oleksandr Zinchenko. But Rebrov says managing the team during wartime has been challenging. Many of the stadiums in Ukraine \u2013 some of which helped co-host the European Championship 12 years ago \u2013 have been damaged by the fighting. That, combined with the constant threat of Russian violence, means Ukraine can\u2019t play or train in its home country, forced instead to travel around the continent to play its home games. \u201cTraveling to the games is very hard. But, as I said, compared with our fighters, it\u2019s nothing,\u201d adds Rebrov, reflecting a sentiment at the heart of everything the team says and does. Communication, then, is key to helping players and backroom staff who have been impacted directly by the consequences of war. Rebrov says having those conversations is often \u201cvery hard\u201d but that he tries to remind his players what they are fighting for every time they pull on that yellow and blue jersey. To do this, the manager says he sometimes relays messages from those fighting on the frontline during team talks and has even shown his players videos of children who have had their lives impacted by the fighting before games. \u201cThey made some videos for several minutes and, of course, the players were crying,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re watching this video, of course, you come onto the pitch with a different sort of motivation.\u201d Heading into the European Championship, Ukraine has already achieved a major goal by just being there. It\u2019s a powerful symbol that, despite everything, a Ukrainian team is still representing the war-torn country on the global stage. Russia, meanwhile, will not take part given UEFA\u2019s continued ban on its participation. While Rebrov knows that qualification alone has brought some good news to Ukrainians around the world, he still wants his team to do itself proud at the tournament in Germany and has told his players to give their \u201cmaximum.\u201d \u201cWe are there and we deserve to be there. I think now is very important to prepare seriously and to show again the spirit of our nation,\u201d he says, while not setting any specific goals for progression at the Euros. \u201cFootball is different for our players. They are concentrated, but the target is different: not only winning the match. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important during the game to show passion, to show character, like shown by our defenders.\u201d Earlier in June, Ukraine documented its highest monthly number of civilian casualties in almost one year, amid Russia\u2019s sweeping offensive on the northeastern region of Kharkiv. The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) recorded a \u201csignificant increase\u201d \u2013 at least 31% \u2013 in the number of civilians killed in Ukraine in May compared to April, according to a press release. Set to that backdrop, Rebrov knows that sport is not very important, but he\u2019s aware it still has a huge role to play in the war effort. Since the start of the war, Zelensky has called on the nation\u2019s biggest sports stars to fly Ukraine\u2019s flag and the likes of heavyweight boxer Oleksandr Usyk and tennis star Elina Svitolina have continued to draw attention to their country\u2019s needs. This year\u2019s European Championship is yet another opportunity for Ukraine\u2019s soccer team  to do their bit in boosting morale. \u201cEverybody from Ukraine [\u2026] is trying to help each other, trying to help our defenders, trying to help the volunteers,\u201d Rebrov says. \u201cOf course, the most important dream is to finish this war and continue to rebuild our country.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/sport/ukraine-euro-2024-sergiy-rebrov-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "sports"}}

{"id": "2024_06_14_sport_scottie-scheffler-ludvig-aberg-us-open-spt-intl", "text": "Many have waxed lyrical about the might of Pinehurst No. 2 across its 117-year history, but on Friday the North Carolina course received perhaps its greatest appraisal yet: it made Scottie Scheffler look human. After exercising a vice-like grip over the golfing realm with an impassive coolness for months on end, the world No. 1\u2019s unflappable brilliance finally buckled during the second round of the 124th US Open on Friday. Scheffler\u2019s run of 168 rounds with at least one birdie went skidding off the sides of Pinehurst\u2019s fiendishly firm and fast greens as he toiled to a four-over par 74, compounding an opening 71. \u201cYesterday I felt like I did a great job. Today I just couldn\u2019t get the putts to fall,\u201d Scheffler told reporters after his round. \u201cThis golf course can be unpredictable at times, and maybe it got the better of me the last couple days. I\u2019ll sit down and think about where we\u2019re going the last few days and figure it out.\u201d How damaging those two days were to Scheffler\u2019s hopes of a sixth win in nine starts was merely a secondary consideration: at five-over overall, the overwhelming tournament favorite arrived at the clubhouse admitting he did not expect to return for the final 36 holes. By the skin of his teeth, Scheffler avoided missing the weekend at a major for the first time since 2022 as another day of high scoring saw the cut line fall at five-over par, edging through the 27-year-old and a host of other relieved stars. \u2018Maybe the worst golf shot I think I\u2019ve ever seen you hit\u2019 It made for an anxious wait after a morning that brimmed with frustration for the typically unflustered Texan. Having started from the 10th tee, Scheffler tossed his putter into the air in exasperation after his par-saving effort at the 15th hole curled away at the death, resigning him to a first bogey of the day. When his opening drive at the 17th veered left, Scheffler muttered to himself in the second person: \u201cMaybe the worst golf shot I think I\u2019ve ever seen you hit.\u201d After a repeat outcome at the subsequent tee box, he slammed his driver on the ground before picking up his tee and throwing it. Despite those errors, the reigning Masters champion generally drove well throughout but struggled on and around the greens, his woes peaking during a disastrous double bogey at the par-five fifth hole. His third shot was an attempted chip onto the green from the native area that gained him mere inches, as his ball caught a slope and rolled back to his feet. Scheffler\u2019s subsequent effort left him even further away from the hole, skipping past the flag and over the other side of the green. There were still a few grains of salt left to rub into the wound, as Scheffler\u2019s putt to escape with a bogey came up four inches short. Incredibly, playing partner and last month\u2019s PGA Championship victor Xander Schauffele endured an almost identical series of unfortunate events for a double bogey of his own, his ball rolling back to him before skidding well past the cup on the next attempt. The world No. 2 put his own frustrations into words candidly after returning to the clubhouse. \u201cThat pissed me off,\u201d Schauffele, who shot one-under 69 to climb into a share of ninth at one-under overall, told reporters. Aberg nudges ahead Though Schauffele remains within striking distance, Scheffler finds himself 10 shots behind Sweden\u2019s Ludvig Aberg, who tops the leaderboard by a stroke at five-under par overall after shooting 69. The 24-year-old has enjoyed a meteoric rise and continues to impress in his first ever US Open appearance and just his third career major outing, having finished second on his Masters debut in April. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that I\u2019m thinking about all the time, but sometimes I have to stop for a little bit and think about how fortunate I am to be able to do this at this level,\u201d world No. 6 Aberg told reporters. \u201cTo be able to play these tournaments, to be able to play with the guys that I\u2019ve watched on TV for such a long time is definitely a pinch-me moment.\u201d Belgium\u2019s Thomas Detry, as well as American duo Bryson DeChambeau and Patrick Cantlay, lead the chasing pack, with Rory McIlroy \u2013 bidding to end a 10-year wait for his fifth major crown \u2013 a stroke behind the trio. Woods uncertain on open future A host of big names fell foul of the cut line, including two of the world\u2019s top-10. Viktor Hovland and Max Homa narrowly missed out at six-over overall, while three-time champion Tiger Woods finished one shot behind the duo. Woods had been competing on a special exemption after failing to qualify for a major for the first time in his professional career, but the 48-year-old showed flashes of his old brilliance as he shot 74 and 73. The 15-time major champion made it to the weekend at the Masters in April but has now missed the cut at successive majors after falling away at the PGA Championship last month. He is eligible to play at next month\u2019s Open Championship in Scotland due to his status as a previous winner yet when asked by CNN\u2019s Patrick Snell if he might have played his last US Open, Woods cast doubt on his future at both open tournaments. \u201cAs far as my last Open Championship or US Open Championship, I don\u2019t know what that is. It may or may not be,\u201d Woods told Snell. \u201cMy ball-striking and felt like my putting was good enough to be in contention and I\u2019m not,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating because I\u2019m not here to have a chance to win on the weekend.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/sport/scottie-scheffler-ludvig-aberg-us-open-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_sport_ukraine-romania-france-austria-euro-2024-spt-intl", "text": "Soccer superstar Kylian\u00a0Mbapp\u00e9 played a vital role in France\u2019s narrow 1-0 win against Austria in its opening Group D match at Euro 2024 on Monday. The new Real Madrid forward showed his trademark speed and lightning quick footwork to create the game\u2019s only goal in the 38th minute. After skipping past a defender, France\u2019s captain flashed a pass across the goal which was inadvertently headed by Austria\u2019s Maximilian W\u00f6ber into his own net. France continued to create chances throughout the tie but failed to add to its lead \u2013 the best chance falling to Mbapp\u00e9 who could only steer his shot wide when faced with just the goalkeeper to beat. Despite dominating for large periods of the match, Les Bleus didn\u2019t have it all their own way, with former Manchester United interim manager Ralf Rangnick\u2019s Austria standing up to the No. 2 team in the world. But the Burschen couldn\u2019t produce that moment of quality in front of goal and eventually ran out of ideas. Mbapp\u00e9 finished the game on France\u2019s bench, though, after the forward bloodied his nose during a collision with Austria\u2019s Kevin Danso. In an attempt to head the ball, the 25-year-old\u2019s face collided with the defender\u2019s shoulder. The Frenchman could be seen heading down the tunnel in the 90th minute with blood staining his shirt. It was far from a vintage performance from France, with Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s moment of brilliance enough to secure a win against a resilient Austrian outfit. The game continued a trend at this year\u2019s tournament, which has seen multiple underdogs provide real challenges against Europe\u2019s supposed powerhouses. Once again, though, the team boasting the higher quality talent eventually got over the line. Les Bleus will face a tough test against the Netherlands in their next group match on Friday, while Austria bids to kickstart its campaign against Poland. Group E: Belgium vs Slovakia Twice, Romelu Lukaku thought he had scored for Belgium, but twice, the striker saw his goal disallowed as Slovakia staged an upset by winning 1-0 in its opening Group E match of Euro 2024. The Sokoli had taken a surprise lead in the seventh minute through Ivan Schranz after Belgian winger J\u00e9r\u00e9my Doku gave the ball away in a dangerous position. Despite the array of attacking talent on the pitch for Belgium, including the likes of Lukaku and Kevin De Bruyne, the Red Devils continued to be wasteful in front of goal and were unable to find an equalizer. Twice, though, striker Lukaku had the ball in the back of the net for Belgium, but the video assistant referee (VAR) saved Slovakia on both occasions. The first attempt was ruled out in the 56th minute for a narrow offside, before a second effort in the 86th minute was disallowed due to a handball by Belgium\u2019s Lo\u00efs Openda in the buildup. In truth, though, Lukaku and his Belgium teammate Leandro Trossard had enough chances between them to get at least a point from the game. Despite riding its luck at times, Slovakia still produced a brilliant performance which was well-deserving of the win. According to TNT Sports, it was the biggest upset in European Championship history by FIFA rankings: world No. 3 Belgium is 45 places ahead of Slovakia. Group E: Ukraine vs. Romania Earlier on Monday, Ukraine suffered a disastrous start to its Euro 2024 campaign, losing 3-0 to Romania in its opening match in Group E. Captain Nicolae Stanciu gave Romania the lead with a superb strike in the 29th minute, before second-half goals from R\u0103zvan Marin and Denis Dr\u0103gu\u0219 settled the exhilarating tie. It was all going to plan for Ukraine in the early stages of the match. The team ranked 24 places higher in the world rankings than Romania was dominating the ball, but things soon started to go wrong. Stanciu\u2019s brilliant long-range effort seemed to throw the Blue and Yellow off their game and the team never fully recovered. Romania, suddenly boasting a formidable sense of hope, doubled its lead shortly into the second half when Marin watched his 53rd minute shot hit the back of the net. In truth, Ukraine goalkeeper Andriy Lunin could have done better with his save, but he let the powerful shot creep under his outstretched hand. The Tricolorii continued to frustrate Ukraine\u2019s attacking frontline and soon scored its third. This time, there was little Lunin could have done as the brilliant Dr\u0103gu\u0219 was left free in the penalty area to tap home from close range. There was a flood of yellow at the full-time whistle, as Romania\u2019s bench rushed onto the pitch to celebrate in front of the team\u2019s traveling fans. Ukraine struggles Ukraine is playing in a major tournament for the first time since Russia launched its full scale invasion of the country in February 2022. Before the game, the Ukrainian Football Association (UAF) displayed a piece of the destroyed stand from Kharkiv\u2019s Sonyachny stadium in the streets of Munich, Germany.

Walsh secured her spot on the US team for next month\u2019s Olympics with victory in the women\u2019s 100m butterfly final in Indianapolis on Sunday, finishing ahead of Torri Huske in a time of 55.31 seconds after a blistering start to the race. Earlier in the trials, the University of Virginia star set a world record in the semifinals, clocking 55.18 seconds to break decorated Swedish swimmer Sarah Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m\u2019s mark from 2016. \u201cI\u2019m still in shock, I don\u2019t even know what to say,\u201d Walsh said in her poolside interview after earning a spot on the team. \u201cMaking the team was the biggest goal, but getting a world record was absolute insanity. I couldn\u2019t ask for a better first event of the meet.\u201d Walsh, who picked up an individual and two relay medals at last year\u2019s world championships in Fukuoka, Japan, will now head to her first Olympics as a strong favorite to win silverware for the US team. After breaking the 100m butterfly record, she was embraced by her older sister, Alex, who competed at the Tokyo Olympics, and coach Todd DeSorbo. \u201cI can\u2019t even describe how it felt,\u201d Walsh said about breaking the record. \u201cI was thinking of my family, my teammates, my coaches, and just all the training that led up to that moment.\u201d Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m was among those to congratulate the 21-year-old after Saturday\u2019s performance, writing on Instagram: \u201cBreaking records is a significant achievement, but it\u2019s also a reminder of the endless possibilities in swimming. \u201cIt\u2019s moments like these that remind us why we fell in love with swimming in the first place \u2013 the pursuit of greatness and the joy of surpassing limits.\u201d That wasn\u2019t the only record to fall on Saturday. A crowd of 20,689 was in attendance at Lucas Oil Stadium to watch the trials, the largest ever to watch a swim meet, according to USA Swimming. On Sunday, 17,697 fans cheered from the stands for the preliminaries, making it the highest-attended prelims in history. The oldest swimmer at the meet, 46-year-old Gabrielle Rose, was hoping to make her third Olympics after competing in Atlanta in 1996 and Sydney in 2000. Rose, more than 30 years older than some of the swimmers attempting to make the team for Paris, set a personal best of 1:08.43 in the women\u2019s 100-meter breaststroke to reach the semifinals. Watched on by her nine-year-old daughter in the stands, Rose was unable to progress beyond the semifinals, despite recording another personal best of 1:08.32. \u201cI\u2019ve absolutely loved going back to my roots as a professional athlete and knowing that this is a special time in my life just to see what I\u2019m capable of,\u201d said Rose. \u201cI\u2019m really lucky to feel so young and feel so strong and just to have this experience,\u201d she added. \u201cI don\u2019t really relate to oldest. I\u2019m just hoping to show people you can do more, you\u2019re capable of doing more, you can have more energy, you can have more strength than you thought was possible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/sport/gretchen-walsh-us-swimming-trials-olympics-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_sport_germany-scotland-euro-2024-spt-intl", "text": "Host Germany kicked off Euro 2024 in spectacular fashion on Friday, hammering 10-man Scotland 5-1 in Munich to record the biggest opening match victory in European Championship history. First-half goals from Florian Wirtz, Jamal Musiala and Kai Havertz put the result beyond doubt early on, before Niclas F\u00fcllkrug and Emre Can, who wasn\u2019t even in the squad 48 hours ago, added gloss to the score line in the second period. Antonio R\u00fcdiger\u2019s own goal in the 87th minute was nothing more than a consolation but gave the Scotland fans a moment to remember on a difficult night. The Tartan Army was dealt a double blow at the end of the first half when Ryan Porteous was shown a red card for a horrific lunge on \u0130lkay G\u00fcndo\u011fan, which also resulted in a penalty and Havertz\u2019s goal. The result \u2013 but more importantly, the dominant nature of Germany\u2019s performance \u2013 will likely be a significant boost for Die Mannschaft fans, who largely didn\u2019t have high hopes for their national team at these home Euros. There will certainly be tougher tests ahead, including against Hungary and Switzerland in the group, but Germany couldn\u2019t have wished for a more straightforward \u2013 and encouraging \u2013 start. \u201cI\u2019m happy, I\u2019m satisfied,\u201d manager Julian Nagelsmann told ITV after the game. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy the first game when you\u2019re the home country. \u201cThe first 20 minutes, we did brilliantly, good possession and counter pressing. We conceded one goal, but in the end, it\u2019s okay.\u201d Blistering start It took just 10 minutes for Germany to find a way through Scotland\u2019s defense as Wirtz\u2019s first-time finish from the edge of the area capped a sweeping team move. It was the kind of clinical finish German fans have come to expect from Wirtz after a stunning season for Bundesliga champion Bayer Leverkusen, ending the campaign with 18 goals and 20 assists in all competitions. Just eight minutes later, it was 2-0. This time, it was a piece of magic from G\u00fcndo\u011fan that unlocked Scotland\u2019s backline, turning on a dime before threading a pinpoint through ball into Havertz, who found Musiala for a thumping finish. Things then looked to have gone from bad to worse for Scotland when Germany was awarded a penalty, but the Tartan Army behind the goal was given a reprieve when the video assistant referee (VAR) ruled Ryan Christie\u2019s foul on Musiala was outside of the area. Scotland was offering next to nothing as an attacking threat and the first half was quickly beginning to resemble a training session as Germany passed the ball around with ease. Any semblance of the match being a contest was ended just before half-time when Porteous was shown a straight red card for his wild lunge on G\u00fcndo\u011fan, which also resulted in a Germany penalty that Havertz converted with nonchalance. There were a few stoic renditions of \u2018Flower of Scotland\u2019 that echoed around the Allianz Arena in the second half, but substitute F\u00fcllkrug\u2019s stunning finish into the top corner promptly silenced the Scottish enthusiasm in the stands. But Scotland did come away with a moment to remember just three minutes from time when substitute Scott McKenna headed Andy Robertson\u2019s long free kick towards goal, taking a deflection off R\u00fcdiger and nestling in the back of the net. Germany didn\u2019t allow Scotland fans much time to enjoy their moment as Can, who was a late callup following youngster Aleksandar Pavlovi\u0107\u2019s injury, found the bottom corner from the edge of the area. The thumping win will be a considerable boost to a team that didn\u2019t come into its home tournament with high expectations. Poor form and performances led to the federation sacking head coach Hansi Flick in September 2023 and bringing in Nagelsmann, who has also struggled to consistently find results. Germany has a rich history in major tournaments, winning four World Cups and three European Championships, but success recently has been harder to come by. The national team hasn\u2019t won a knockout match at a major tournament in almost eight years, getting knocked out at the group stages of the two previous World Cups and losing in the round of 16 at Euro 2020. But after Germany\u2019s performance on Friday, some fans might now be dreaming of a second \u2018Sommerm\u00e4rchen\u2019 \u2013 or \u2018summer fairytale\u2019 \u2013 a term given to the summer of 2006 when Germany unexpectedly reached the semifinals of the World Cup on home soil when expectations were similarly low. That year, it was an early Philipp Lahm goal and 4-2 win over Costa Rica that sparked an unlikely summer party. Could Wirtz\u2019s goal be the catalyst this year?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/sport/germany-scotland-euro-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2023_10_30_sport_enhanced-games-olympics-doping-spt-intl", "text": "The 2024 Olympics are fast approaching and as athletes gear up for one of the world\u2019s most prestigious sporting events, one entrepreneur has a different idea of what \u201cfaster, higher, stronger\u201d \u2013 the former motto of the Games \u2013 might represent. The Enhanced Games says it is an \u201calternative\u201d to what it calls the \u201ccorrupt Olympics Games.\u201d Athletes competing at the Enhanced Games will be free to use performance-enhancing drugs, they won\u2019t be tested and will be under no obligation to declare which substances they have taken in order to compete. That\u2019s quite a contrast to the Olympics\u2019 doping protocols. The International Testing Agency (ITA) will be responsible for looking after Paris 2024\u2019s anti-doping program. Six years ago, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which oversees the Olympics, delegated its entire clean sport program to the ITA. However, historically the Olympic Games have been dogged by a series of doping and kickback scandals. When approached for comment on the Enhanced Games and allegations of corruption, the IOC told CNN Sport that \u201cthe idea does not merit any comment.\u201d \u2018Danger to health, to sport\u2019 CNN Sport interviewed a number of experts in the field of doping for this story, who expressed concern that the Enhanced Games was an extremely dangerous proposition. Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, who exposed Russia\u2019s state-sponsored doping program \u2013 a massive, years-long effort which benefited more than 1,000 athletes between 2011 and 2015 \u2013 said that the Enhanced Games is a \u201cdanger to health, to sport.\u201d Whether the Enhanced Games will ever take place remains an open question, but the very idea is drawing considerable blowback from leading anti-doping officials and sporting organizations. The Enhanced Games is the brainchild of businessman Aron D\u2019Souza. He is also the founding editor of \u201cThe Journal Jurisprudence,\u201d a quarterly publication on legal philosophy, according to his website, which also describes him as an \u201cavid athlete.\u201d Recently, D\u2019Souza told CNN Sport he has \u201csigned term sheets with prominent venture capital firms\u201d in relation to the Enhanced Games and is \u201cwaiting on the lawyers to finish long-form drafting.\u201d He also said that a funding announcement is planned for early December. Although not legally binding, term sheets are a serious expression of intent by both sides, setting out the broad principles of an agreement. D\u2019Souza believes what he calls a \u201cscience-driven\u201d competition is the next step in the evolution of sport, suggesting that the absence of drug testing will level the playing field. According to a 2020 study from Raphael Faiss, Research Manager at the centre of Research and Expertise in anti-doping sciences at the University of Lausanne, data from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) suggests less than 2% of athletes dope. However, Faiss told CNN Sport the number of athletes taking performance-enhancing drugs is likely significantly higher; his research, based on two international major athletic events in 2011 and 2013, suggests the figure could be between 15 to 18%. Faiss and his team compared athletes\u2019 blood results collected by WADA-accredited labs to values from healthy adults, as well as doped and undoped athletes; the closer the values are to those of subjects to whom erythropoietin (EPO, which is used in blood doping) had been administered, the higher the chances that they\u2019re actually doping. This analysis, Faiss said, is not proof of doping, but is a \u201crobust way\u201d of analyzing the data, allowing scientists to make an estimate for doping prevalence, as well as targeting athletes most likely to be doping. In written comments to CNN Sport, WADA said: \u201cDetermining the level of [doping] prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed,\u201d explaining that, since 2017, a \u201cprevalence working group\u201d has been established to \u201cdetermine if strategies, reliable methods and tools can be developed to adequately assess the prevalence of doping in sports.\u201d WADA told CNN Sport that the group has delivered \u201cseveral recommendations and guidance to WADA but not the final ones yet.\u201d WADA has reservations about Faiss\u2019 study and pointed to the \u201ccomplexity of trying to measure [doping] prevalence,\u201d highlighting that reports have \u201cgreatly varying results.\u201d The anti-doping organization added: \u201cNo single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline.\u201d \u201cComparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system\u2019s testing figures isn\u2019t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence. \u201cIn any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries \u2013 it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others. \u201cThe Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures.\u201d Editor\u2019s note: You can find WADA\u2019s full statement at the bottom of this article.\u00a0 \u2018A dangerous clown show\u2019 Travis Tygart, the Chief Executive Officer at the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), told CNN Sport that the idea of an Enhanced Games is \u201cfarcical \u2026 likely illegal in many [US] states\u201d and \u201ca dangerous clown show, not real sport.\u201d Substances such as anabolic steroids \u2013 which help to build muscle mass by enabling athletes to train harder and recover quickly from strenuous workouts \u2013 are classified as a Schedule III drug by the US Drug Enforcement Administration. When asked whether anabolic steroids will be allowed at the games and whether athletes would be tested for illegal drugs such as cocaine, D\u2019Souza told CNN Sport that \u201cwe will not be drug testing at the games.\u201d He added: \u201cWe do not propose to regulate what athletes use.\u201d Anabolic steroids may be prescribed by a licensed physician for the treatment of certain conditions such as testosterone deficiency, but if used in the US without a prescription from a licensed physician, a first conviction could result in a one-year prison sentence and a $1,000 fine. But that isn\u2019t the only potential legal jeopardy the Enhanced Games faces, according to American lawyer Jim Walden, who represents Russian whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov. \u201cIf you look at the Enhanced Games website, it\u2019s almost as though they\u2019re advertising their disregard of the law,\u201d Walden told CNN Sport. \u201cThey wrap themselves up in what I will call the cloak of legitimacy by using phrases like body autonomy and coming out as an enhanced athlete. \u201cI hope they\u2019re thinking hard about how they\u2019re going to pull this off in the world in which the FBI has a specific unit that is called the Sports and Gaming Initiative that\u2019s focusing on these very issues.\u201d The Sports and Gaming Initiative was developed to \u201cprotect athletes and sporting institutions in the United States from criminal threats and influences,\u201d according to the government website. The initiative works in partnership with sports leagues and governing bodies, international law enforcement and independent watchdog groups to tackle crimes such as fraud, doping and match-fixing; criminal activities, it says, \u201cdegrade the integrity of sports and competition and erode public confidence in these cherished institutions.\u201d \u201cThe use of doping substances is not acceptable in modern sports,\u201d Rodchenkov said in his written comments to CNN. \u201cPromotion and advertising of banned substances is against sport rules and moral, letter and spirit. \u201cIt might bring an extreme harm to young generation[s] of athletes who mistakenly could believe in benefits of [the] Enhanced Games.\u201d Rodchenkov, the protagonist of the Oscar-winning Netflix documentary Icarus who is currently under FBI protection, also believes that the Enhanced Games\u2019 organizers \u201cmight get investigated [\u2026] under the Rodchenkov Act.\u201d The Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act, named after the whistleblower, allows the US to impose criminal sanctions on individuals involved in doping activities at international events. However, the Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act does not apply to sporting events that don\u2019t adopt the WADA code, which the Enhanced Games wouldn\u2019t do. Rodchenkov also added that WADA athletes could not have any affiliation or contact with so-called enhanced athletes, or they would risk being charged under Article 2.10 \u2013 \u201cProhibited Association by an Athlete or Other Person\u201d \u2013 of the World Anti-Doping Code. USADA\u2019s Tygart also told CNN Sport: \u201cNo one really wants our children growing up idolizing unbridled drug use in sport, even if some profiteers think otherwise.\u201d D\u2019Souza insists his motivation for founding the Enhanced Games isn\u2019t financial. If he had wanted to make more money, he says he\u2019d continue to be a \u201cquiet, mild-mannered venture capitalist.\u201d \u201cI do think fundamentally that consumers want this [the Enhanced Games] and athletes want this because if you go to the cinemas, no one\u2019s interested in histories in the past anymore,\u201d said D\u2019Souza. \u201cThey\u2019re interested in superheroes and technology in the future. And this is literally what we are bringing to a reality.\u201d \u2018The dirtiest Olympics in history\u2019 According to Pierre de Coubertin \u2013 the founder of the modern Olympics \u2013 \u201cfor every man, woman and child, it [sport] offers an opportunity for self-improvement.\u201d Except historically, many athletes competing in the Olympics have taken the idea of self-improvement too far, notably at London 2012, which Rodchenkov has previously called \u201cthe dirtiest Olympics in history.\u201d When the ITA concluded its re-analysis program for the London Games, it found 73 anti-doping rule violations, which led to the withdrawal of 31 medals and reallocation of 46 Olympic medals across the sports of athletics, weightlifting, wrestling and canoeing. Doping has been an issue at the Olympics throughout the event\u2019s history, and the 100-meter final at the 1988 Games has become one of the most infamous and controversial moments in sporting history. Six of the eight finalists \u2013 notably the winner, Ben Johnson \u2013 who lined up on that September day in Seoul 35 years ago would fail drug tests themselves or be implicated in drug use during their careers. Despite some athletes continuing to cheat, global antidoping efforts remain ever-present, according to the testers. Recent out-of-competition (OOC) testing data published by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) highlights positive results from steps being taken to keep \u201celite podiums and finals clean,\u201d according to the anti-doping organization. Data focused on OOC testing ahead of last year\u2019s World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon, shows how resources and testing are targeting those athletes most likely to win medals and make finals. Whilst only 39% of the athletes in Eugene had three or more OOC tests in the 10 months leading up the event, 81% of top-eight finishers had three or more OOC tests. Yet the cat and mouse game between testers and athletes using banned substances continues. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly about the question of timing and targeting the right athletes,\u201d said Faiss. Given that athletes have their blood values regularly monitored, it is \u201cgetting more difficult for athletes to use high doses [of drugs such as EPO], but they would still be using micro dosing.\u201d By taking EPO late at night and drinking enough water, the substance would not be detected in athletes the following morning, according to Faiss, though athletes suspected of blood doping could be tested in the middle of the night. \u201cAthletes are actually getting back to very simple ways of doping with steroids,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cEPO is quite simple to use, but still tricky to detect.\u201d Athletes \u201cuse the drugs that are actively working.\u201d When it comes to new substances such as Roxadustat \u2013 the drug that two-time grand slam champion Simona Halep has recently been given a four-year ban for taking, although she denies ever knowingly or intentionally taking any prohibited substance \u2013 Faiss said athletes \u201care likely to use substances with a very short half-life in [the] body that are mimicking processes of the oxygen carrying improvements through the EPO channels.\u201d Roxadustat has an elimination half-life of 10-16 hours, according to the National Institutes of Health. Athletes are \u201cseeking to find substances where the [half-life] time window is very short, to make sure that if they are not tested at the right moment, they won\u2019t be caught,\u201d said Faiss. \u2018Challenge for sporting competition\u2019 Michele Verroken, the founding director of consultancy group Sporting Integrity, believes an antidoping system is required that will \u201cgive a lot more credibility, a lot more immediacy to verifying results, if we\u2019re going to keep the hearts and minds of athletes.\u201d Verroken also questions what\u2019s stopping an athlete from cheating if they only get caught 10 years after the event, or not at all. Under the World Anti-Doping Code, there is a 10-year statute of limitations on samples taken from 2015 onwards. Verroken told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games is \u201csetting a really interesting challenge for sporting competition.\u201d Not unsurprisingly, many sporting bodies have condemned the event. The Australian Olympic Committee called it \u201cdangerous and irresponsible,\u201d saying that \u201cthe world needs better than this.\u201d UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) said it \u201cis extremely concerned by the concept of an Enhanced Games,\u201d adding that \u201cthere is no place in sport for performance enhancing drugs, nor the Enhanced Games.\u201d UKAD\u2019s Director of Operations, Hamish Coffey, told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games sets a \u201chugely dangerous precedent,\u201d expressing concern over the kind of messaging the event sends to the next generation of athletes. \u2018Very accomplished athletes\u2019 When CNN Sport spoke to D\u2019Souza shortly after the proposed event\u2019s announcement, he said that 368 athletes had enquired about the Enhanced Games and more had messaged via social media. The organization\u2019s Chief Athletes Officer and former Olympian Brett Fraser, who swam for the Cayman Islands at three Olympic Games, told CNN Sport that \u201cvery accomplished athletes\u201d at the level of Olympic finalists have reached out \u201cto understand more about how the first Games will take place and how they can become involved.\u201d Fraser added that Enhanced Games organizers \u201calready have an Olympic medallist\u201d for their athlete commission, though he didn\u2019t specify who that was. He also said there has been \u201ca lot of positive feedback and a lot of acceptance and excitement from younger generations.\u201d Nonetheless, none of the athletes appear prepared to speak publicly at this stage. For those who do want to compete, the Enhanced Games would be an annual event with five categories \u2013 track and field, swimming, weightlifting, gymnastics and martial arts. The huge cost of hosting an Olympic Games is no secret, with countries often striving to create bigger and better spectacles by blowing their budget. Tokyo 2021 had the largest Olympic sports program in history, with 33 sports competitions in 42 venues culminating in 339 medal events. The Covid-impacted Games were delivered with a final expenditure of $13 billion \u2013 almost double the $7.3 billion that was originally forecast. Meanwhile, keeping the IOC\u2019s philosophy of \u201clower-impact Games\u201d in mind, 95% of venues will be pre-existing facilities at the Paris 2024 Olympics. D\u2019Souza said the Enhanced Games will focus on fewer sports, reuse existing infrastructure and fund the event through the private sector to \u201cdeliver a high-impact yet cost-efficient games\u201d so profits can be shared with the athletes. He added that the Enhanced Games is looking for a seven-figure prize pool for any athlete potentially breaking Usain Bolt\u2019s 100-meter world record of 9.58 seconds. \u201cI\u2019ve had conversations with people who are top-10 sprinters in the world who are going to the next Olympics, and they said [\u2026] if there\u2019s a million-dollar prize to break the 100m world record, I\u2019ll be there,\u201d said D\u2019Souza. Universal basic income and mental health support to athletes will also be part of an \u201cenhanced athletes programme.\u201d When asked who would take responsibility if an athlete competing at the Enhanced Games were to suffer fatal consequences, D\u2019Souza told CNN Sport that \u201cour athletes at the games will be the most monitored athletes in history.\u201d He said: \u201cWe will focus on athlete safety by mandating athletes have pre-competition full-system clinical screenings including blood tests and EKGs.\u201d \u201cThis will ensure that athletes are healthy to complete and not at risk of major health complications.\u201d D\u2019Souza also said that athletes will sign waivers in order\u00a0to compete. As it stands, no venues are officially in place to host the event and D\u2019Souza admits its scale will be dependent on funding and media partnerships. \u201cWe\u2019re in commercial negotiations with venues and media partners at the moment,\u201d added D\u2019Souza, who said the first Enhanced Games will be at a university campus or a similar facility in the south of the US and that a number of trademarks have been filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. \u2018Undermine the very purpose of sport\u2019 Elite performance coach Trevor Painter, who has worked with a number of Olympic and international sprinters and middle-distance runners, said he would \u201cnever\u201d coach an athlete taking performance-enhancing drugs because it would go against his morals as a coach. \u201cHaving been involved with many athletes that have lost in many ways to the cheats, I won\u2019t be engaging with [the Enhanced Games],\u201d Painter told CNN Sport. If it goes ahead as planned in December 2024, D\u2019Souza insists that the Enhanced Games will unlock the potential of humanity. But according to John William Devine, Senior Lecturer in Ethics, Sport and Exercise Sciences at Swansea University in Wales, the Enhanced Games will make sporting competition more unfair than it already is and even \u201cundermine the very purpose of the sport in question.\u201d Devine told CNN Sport that \u201cperformance-enhancing drugs don\u2019t actually lead to better athletic performance. They obscure athletic performance.\u201d He added that, although the Enhanced Games may look very similar to the Olympics, the nature of the activity will be different, raising the question: \u201cTo what extent is drug-assisted performance reflective of the athletes\u2019 sporting excellence?\u201d WADA response in full: Determining the level of prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed. That is why we set up a\u00a0Working Group on Doping Prevalence\u00a0in 2017. Measuring doping prevalence is a difficult and complex process. Through its work, the group found a huge variance across the many prevalence studies that have been carried out, leading it to publish guidelines on how to improve the quality of measuring prevalence. WADA is currently developing a tool that Anti-Doping Organizations can use to evaluate the effectiveness of their programs. WADA is well aware of the [Faiss] study. Indeed, one of the contributors, Prof. Martial Saugy, is a member of the Working Group. This study is one of many that helps to inform the Group\u2019s work. It is a very narrow study. It looks at two events, in a single sport, held 10 and 12 years ago, using just one method of measurement (the Athlete Biological Passport (ABP)). As far as I am aware, there is no comparable data from more recent World Championships in the same sport. Given its limited scope, it is important that this study be analyzed within the wider context of other studies and not be taken in isolation. This study also highlights the complexity of trying to measure prevalence. It is the third published paper that sought to measure prevalence at the 2011 Athletics World Championships. Each reported greatly varying results. The fact is no single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline. Results will always come with caveats and margins of error and will be based on a variety of methods, including self-report questionnaires, analytical methods (like ABP and testing data) and other methods to give a more rounded estimate of what the most likely figure would be. Comparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system\u2019s testing figures isn\u2019t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence. In any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries \u2013 it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others. The Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/10/30/sport/enhanced-games-olympics-doping-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "sports"}}

{"id": "2023_09_20_sport_saudi-arabia-soccer-spl-bin-salman-intl-spt-cmd-dg", "text": "When Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal reportedly planned a $1.1 billion bid to sign French soccer superstar Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 \u2013 including $332 million to his club, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), and an eye-watering $775 million salary packet to the World Cup winner for just one year \u2013 it was slammed by critics as sportswashing. Mbapp\u00e9 might have said no to the offer in July, but a month later, Neymar Jr. said yes to Al-Hilal, as the Brazil star moved from PSG for a transfer fee of around $98.5 million (\u20ac90 million) plus add-ons, according to multiple reports. In a record-breaking transfer window, Saudi Pro League (SPL) clubs spent close to $1 billion, acquiring 94 overseas players from Europe\u2019s major leagues \u2013 France\u2019s Ligue 1, Spain\u2019s La Liga, Italy\u2019s Serie A, Germany\u2019s Bundesliga and the English Premier League \u2013 according to Deloitte. Despite the Arab nation\u2019s poor human rights record, Saudi Arabia\u2019s spending spree to turn its domestic soccer league into a star-studded, bona fide competition shows the seriousness of its ambition. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman says he doesn\u2019t \u201ccare\u201d about the country\u2019s investment in sport being described as sportswashing. \u201cWell if sportswashing is going to increase my GDP by one percent, then I will continue doing sportswashing,\u201d MBS said in an\u00a0interview\u00a0with Fox News which aired Wednesday. Pressed on if he was bothered by the use of the term, MBS continued: \u201cI don\u2019t care. I have one percent GDP growth from sport, and I am aiming for another one and a half percent. Call it whatever you want, we\u2019re going to get that one and a half percent.\u201d Saudi clubs, several of which have been taken over by the nation\u2019s sovereign Public Investment Fund (PIF), have already attracted some of the biggest names in the sport. By attracting some of the world\u2019s biggest stars to the Gulf states, the SPL wants \u201cto drive competitiveness on and off the pitch,\u201d though it\u2019s keen to emphasize that these overseas players will help develop \u201cyoung Saudi talent.\u201d During this summer transfer window, the government-controlled PIF increased the cumulative value of these four clubs nearly five times, making them the most valuable in the country, according to estimates by the sports website Transfermarkt. Plenty of other leading stars have eagerly said yes to the SPL, notably 2022 Ballon D\u2019Or winner Karim Benzema joining Al-Ittihad at the end of his contract with Spanish soccer giant Real Madrid. As the European transfer window came to a close, the four PIF-owned teams have spent nearly $900 million (\u20ac835.1 million) on buying elite international players, Transfermarkt data shows, which ranked them in the top 20 clubs in the world by transfer expenditure, alongside soccer giants from England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy. Al Hilal alone paid more than $378 million (\u20ac353 million), more than PSG and Arsenal, making it the second-largest spender this year. The newly acquired players join five-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, who has a two-year contract with Al-Nassr where he will earn a staggering estimated $200 million a year, according to Saudi state-owned media, currently making him the world\u2019s highest paid soccer player. As of today, 21 of the most expensive soccer players in Saudi Arabia by transfer fees \u2013 all international stars \u2013 play for one of the PIF-owned clubs. Despite the financial outlay, the SPL is remaining deliberately tight-lipped about the specifics of its financial gamble, with chief operating officer Carlo Nohra confirming to CNN Sport that it was \u201cnot in [the SPL\u2019s] competitive advantage\u201d to report the salaries offered to players and coaches. The PIF has $777 billion in assets under management, according to its most recent filing, with ambitions to top $1 trillion within a few years. In 2021, it acquired English soccer club Newcastle United, before focusing on investments at home. The club is now also among top spenders on players. Saudi clubs not owned by the PIF are also splurging on big-ticket players, with former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson, 33, offered an eye-watering salary of $870,000 (\u00a3700,000) per week, according to multiple reports, in an estimated $15 million (\u00a312 million) transfer from Liverpool to Saudi team Al-Ettifaq. In a recent interview with The Athletic, Henderson said those numbers \u201cjust aren\u2019t true.\u201d \u201cEssentially, the signal is \u2018We mean business,\u2019\u201d Simon Chadwick, a professor of sport and geopolitical economy at SKEMA Business School, told CNN.\u201cWe\u2019ve got so much money that for a player who is \u2026 coming towards the end of his career, we can afford to pay him 700,000 [GB pounds a week], or whatever it is that he\u2019s being paid, and still have Cristiano Ronaldo and still be in the market for other players as well,\u201d Chadwick said, describing Saudi\u2019s approach to becoming a sporting superpower, adding that the sky is the limit in terms of cost. Saudi\u2019s love of soccer Saudi Arabia follows in the footsteps of several other countries \u2013 including China and Qatar in investing large sums of money to try and turn themselves into soccer powerhouses. It remains to be seen whether Saudi\u2019s turbocharged investment will have a lasting impact or resemble something like a costly rebranding effort. The Saudi national team has been to multiple World Cups, and the country\u2019s clubs have won multiple Asian titles. Saudi\u2019s victory over Argentina during last year\u2019s men\u2019s World Cup was hailed as one of the greatest upsets in tournament history, with the country\u2019s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud granting a national public holiday in recognition of the win. Club games can attract huge crowds in the Middle Eastern nation. \u201cFor example, Al-Ittihad against Al-Hilal, you\u2019re talking about drawing crowds of 40, 50, 60,000 people, these are games that are comparable in size to Chelsea vs. Arsenal, Manchester United vs. Manchester City,\u201d Chadwick said. Buying star players, some arguably past their prime, also provides an easy win for Saudi teams, according to Kieran Maguire, co-host of \u201cThe Price of Football\u201d podcast. \u201cFrom the Saudi authorities\u2019 point of view, they\u2019re getting a ready-made product. Everybody\u2019s heard of Benzema. Everybody\u2019s heard of Cristiano Ronaldo and so on,\u201d Maguire said. Saudi Arabia\u2019s lofty sporting ambitions don\u2019t end with the SPL or Newcastle United. The country is hosting the 2023 FIFA Club World Cup and is bidding to host the 2027 AFC Asian Cup. Several media reports also indicated that the Gulf kingdom was considering launching a bid for the 2030 FIFA men\u2019s World Cup alongside Greece and Egypt \u2013 although it is reportedly mulling pulling its candidacy. Meanwhile, the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) has agreed to a contract that will see the Spanish Super Cup played in Saudi Arabia until 2029, a deal that will earn the Spanish governing body between \u20ac35-45 million ($38-48 million) a year. Appealing to the youth Saudi Arabia has a very young population: the country\u2019s most recent census revealed 32.2 million people live in the country, nearly 42% of whom are foreign nationals \u2013 and 51% of the Saudi population are under the age of 30.\u202fOf this populace, Saudi authorities say that over 80% play, attend or follow soccer, the national sport. Chadwick explains that Saudi Arabia\u2019s government is concerned with the prospect of its younger members of society becoming radicalized or an anti-government sentiment bubbling up like that of the Arab Spring \u2013 and looks to offer its population a thriving soccer industry to keep it placated. Though the soccer industry generates employment, revenues, export earnings and inward investment, \u201cwhat is just as significant is the security of the royal family,\u201d Chadwick adds. The Arab Spring, a wave of pro-democracy protests that washed over the Middle East and North Africa in 2011, achieved mixed results. Four Arab dictators in Libya, Yemen, Egypt and Tunisia were toppled, offering a brief sense of victory for protesters, but, since then, new wars have prompted a retreat of popular movements in the region. Meanwhile, failed uprisings in Bahrain and eastern Saudi Arabia were followed by years-long crackdowns and a continuing civil war in Syria. \u201cWhat we\u2019re beginning to see in Saudi Arabia right now is the emergence of a new social contract. And the social contract essentially is catering for the needs of the Gen Z population,\u201d Chadwick said. \u201cYou want Ronaldo? You got him. You want some of the best football teams in the world? You got them. You want the World Cup to come to Saudi Arabia? You got it \u2026 But don\u2019t question us,\u201d Chadwick explained. Maguire agrees, noting that investing in soccer \u201ccan be seen as part of a much broader socio-economic plan, run by the Saudi authorities.\u201d At the same time, there has been \u201ca significant increase in the number of Saudi Arabians detained by the authorities, for example, for posting adverse comments on social media about the country\u201d this year, Chadwick told CNN. Human rights group Amnesty International told CNN that it has documented a rollback in human rights in Saudi Arabia, including an escalating crackdown on freedom of expression and an increased use of counterterrorism and cybercrime laws to silence dissent. Between 2022 and 2023, the organization said it has documented an increase in criminal prosecutions compared to previous years. In 2022, Amnesty reported the highest number of annual executions in the country in 30 years, with 196 people killed. \u201cReputation is important in terms of attracting foreign investment, and \u2026 Mohammed bin Salman, as much as he has significant financial muscle, needs foreign investing for the realization of his diversification,\u201d James Dorsey, the author of the syndicated column and blog, \u201cThe Turbulent World of Middle East Soccer,\u201d explains. Saudi Arabia is the world\u2019s biggest exporter of crude oil, and nearly two-thirds of its income still comes from selling fossil fuels. But with oil prices regularly dipping below what the Gulf state needs to balance its budget, it has focused efforts on trying to bring in investment from abroad along with its efforts to raise oil prices. Projections indicate the kingdom has around 20 years to diversify its economy to ensure it is more resilient, according to Chadwick \u2013 not least to fund its Vision 2030 projects, including the $500 billion Neom city, a 106 mile-long linear city called The Line and a futuristic plan to revamp the capital. \u201cPart of the grand vision of Mohammed bin Salman, looking forward to 2030, he does have his desire to make Saudi Arabia less dependent on natural resources to look at a post-fuel economy [involving] tourism, entertainment. If Saudi Arabia can become a hub for major sporting events, then that\u2019s a way of attracting interest to the country,\u201d said Maguire. CNN has reached out to the Saudi Ministry of Sport for comment on allegations that the kingdom has been rolling back human rights, and investing in soccer as a way of \u201csportswashing\u201d its image. In response to previous criticism about Saudi Arabia\u2019s purported \u201csportswashing,\u201d the kingdom\u2019s sports minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal said: \u201cPeople that don\u2019t know Saudi Arabia, have never been to Saudi Arabia, go out and talk about it as if they\u2019ve lived there for 30 years, 40 years. So I always tell people, come to Saudi. Come and see Saudi. \u201cSee what it is, see the people, meet the people. Look at what the country is doing for the future of the people in Saudi, then you can criticize as much as you like,\u201d he added. Lack of transparency: Saudi threatens new systems of governance\u202fin sports Saudi Arabia has already disrupted the golf industry and, with soccer, Maguire told CNN, \u201cthey feel that they can do that probably on a smaller scale, but perhaps, ultimately, to generate more interest in terms of eyeballs if they go down the same route.\u201d In 2021, the Saudi government-controlled PIF bankrolled LIV Golf, reportedly at a cost of $2 billion, attracting many of the sport\u2019s top players away from the US-based PGA Tour and Europe-based DP World Tour by offering big dollar prize money, with PGA Tour board member Jimmy Dunne raising fears that they might end up \u201cowning golf.\u201d Earlier this year, the US-based PGA Tour announced it was set to partner with the Saudi-backed breakaway LIV Golf, ending a feud that has dogged the men\u2019s professional game for the past year, with Dunne warning that sport\u2019s governing body had no choice but to reach the truce to retain some measure of control. \u201cThey have an unlimited horizon and an unlimited amount of money,\u201d he said at a contentious Senate hearing on the truce between the two tours. When it comes to soccer, Aleksander Ceferin, president of European football\u2019s governing body UEFA, has dismissed the competitive threat that the SPL could pose. \u201cAs far as I know, Mbappe and [Erling] Haaland don\u2019t dream of Saudi Arabia. I don\u2019t believe that the best players at the pinnacle of their careers would go to Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said last month. \u201cWhen people talk to me about the players who went there, nobody knows where they\u2019re playing.\u201d Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp took a different view, referring to the fact that the Saudi summer transfer window stays open after European clubs see theirs close: \u201cI don\u2019t know how stable it is and I think the next two weeks will show how much of a challenge it is because whatever happens there, no one can react anymore. \u201cI don\u2019t know where it will lead to but it feels rather like a threat or a concern than not because I can\u2019t see how we really deny it in these moments, what can we do?\u201d he added. Still, the new SPL director of football, Michael Emenalo, says what Saudi soccer is doing is \u201cno different from what the Premier League have done.\u201d \u201cThere was a time when it was all about Italy. There was a time when it was all about Spain. What we\u2019re looking for in the industry is an opportunity to compete, and to compete on an even scale and to improve upon whatever exists in the industry,\u201d said Emenalo in a press release sent to CNN. New Saudi Pro League Chief Operating Officer Carlo Nohra told CNN that there is logic behind the league\u2019s strategy of money is no object to lure international stars. \u201cWe can\u2019t expect to be paying market value to entice people to come here at this early stage in our development.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0But analysts say that the difference lies in the level of transparency, which \u201csimply doesn\u2019t exist in Saudi Arabia,\u201d Chadwick explained to CNN. European soccer governing body UEFA has financial fair play (FFP) rules on teams\u2019 spending, while Major League Soccer in the US has a salary cap for its clubs. Nohra told CNN that, eventually, the country wants 0.3% of its GDP to be from soccer to make it similar to that of the Premier League on the UK economy \u2013 up from its current value of \u201c0.000 something.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve got no chance to get into that figure at present,\u201d Maguire explained, but added that the SPL could perhaps move into the top 10 of the world\u2019s domestic leagues. \u201cThat is feasible given the amount of money that they\u2019re spending.\u201d \u201cI think they\u2019re realistic. They don\u2019t say that they\u2019re going to overtake La Liga or the Premier League or the major European leagues,\u201d Maguire said. When the Peterson Institute for International Economics compared the world\u2019s sovereign wealth funds on criteria including governance, transparency and accountability in 2019, the PIF scored well below average on a measure combining these criteria, and ranked in the bottom 10 out of 64 funds, just above Russian Direct Investment Fund. CNN has reached out to the PIF for further comment about its investments in sport, particularly soccer and golf, and criticisms about its lack of transparency. Chadwick raised concerns over how a lack of financial rules affecting Saudi clubs might dilute UEFA\u2019s FFP regulations, as well as those of the Premier League, or impact world soccer governing body FIFA\u2019s systems of governance. The lack of transparency in Saudi Arabia\u2019s wealth fund has already raised suspicions in the US golfing and political spheres. Earlier this summer, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations launched an inquiry about the PGA Tour\u2019s agreement with the PIF-controlled LIV Golf. Chadwick told CNN that, so long as there is no independent organization that monitors the reporting of every league\u2019s financial endeavors, \u201cnobody really knows for sure what the accurate financial information is.\u201d \u201cThis vacuum [of information], this uncertainty is wrapped in a veneer of lobbying, which is intended to either overinflate or underinflate player transfer values and salary information because it serves a political purpose,\u201d Chadwick says, adding that this purpose is \u201csignaling.\u201d \u201cIt is almost as though football players are becoming kind of geopolitical pawns in some ways.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/09/20/sport/saudi-arabia-soccer-spl-bin-salman-intl-spt-cmd-dg/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_sport_euro-2024-georgia-underdogs-coach-spt-intl", "text": "As Nika Kvekveskiri stepped up to the penalty spot, he had the expectations of a nation weighing heavily on his shoulders. Score and Georgia would qualify for Euro 2024; miss and it might be yet another story of heartbreak for this generation of fans to live through. As the midfielder started his run-up, assistant coach David Webb held his breath, tightly huddled together with the rest of the team. The entire nation watched as Kvekveskiri stuttered on his approach to the ball, before releasing a shot into the bottom left corner. \u201cYou could feel a pin drop in the stadium and then, when he put it in the bottom corner, it erupted,\u201d Georgia\u2019s assistant coach Webb tells CNN Sport, recalling the moment the nation qualified for Euro 2024 with a penalty shootout win against Greece \u2013 the first major tournament it has ever reached. \u201cStaff were crying. Players were crying. Fans bombarded the pitch. It was quite emotional.\u201d The winning spot-kick sparked jubilant scenes \ufeffinside Tbilisi\u2019s Boris Paichadze Dinamo Arena, as fans flooded onto the pitch and players celebrated in the dressing room. Webb smiles as he remembers those chaotic scenes of unbridled joy back in late March, laughing as he tries to recall which songs the players sang as they partied through the night. The excitement spread up and down the football-mad country and the anticipation has continued building ahead of the tournament\u2019s start in Germany on June 14. For Webb, it was a moment that he will never forget, and the \u201csurreal\u201d outcome has continued to provide memories that will last a lifetime \u2013 he\u2019s even in the process of getting an honorary Georgian passport. Helping Georgia qualify for Euro 2024 is the latest highlight in Webb\u2019s unique coaching career, a journey which has taken some unlikely twists and turns over the years. Watching football on a \u2018chess board\u2019 After realizing he wasn\u2019t quite good enough to forge a career as a top-flight player, Englishman Webb quickly made his name as a coach, impressing in a number of different roles \u2013 including youth coach and recruiter \u2013 at a host of professional English clubs. It was always the psychological side of the game that fascinated Webb most, an ability that enabled him to spot a player\u2019s potential where others could not. \u201cAnyone can pick the best players,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me, it was always about scratching under the surface a little bit. What makes [players] tick, what makes them develop.\u201d Webb is different from many other coaches in the world of football. He is softly spoken, unassuming and doesn\u2019t come with the usual bravado which is prevalent in a sport full of egos. Rather than looking purely at tactics and statistics \u2013 elements that are still important to his philosophy \u2013 he is more interested in fostering healthy relationships and creating environments for players to flourish. It\u2019s an approach rooted in his ability to empathize with people and something he credits to being slightly neurodiverse as a child. \u201cI had a sort of feeling and affiliation towards people and I always found football quite easy to watch,\u201d Webb says. \u201cI was watching games like a chess board, like a helicopter over the game. It was sort of a feeling and intuition with people. I kind of found I was getting a lot of this right over the years, especially when it comes to football and spotting talent.\u201d Webb decided to enhance this natural ability and obtained a postgraduate degree in sport psychology. Understanding the \u201chumanistic\u201d side of football, he says, is something that gives him an extra edge in his coaching career. Then, when a frustrating spell as manager of non-league club York City ended in disappointment in 2023, Webb got the chance to prove himself on the biggest stage. As chance would have it, Webb had briefly met former France international Willy Sagnol while on scouting duties in France in 2014. The pair hit it off and kept in contact over the years, with Sagnol impressed with the different way in which Webb sees the game. After Sagnol was appointed manager of the Georgian men\u2019s national team in 2021 and, after Webb found himself at a loose end, he was offered the chance to become one of the team\u2019s assistant coaches. Emotional Euro 2024 campaign It was an opportunity Webb couldn\u2019t turn down, a chance to work with an exciting generation who had their hearts set on qualification to Euro 2024. His remit was broad, tasked not only with helping to coach the players but also strengthening them mentally. He first set up one-to-one interviews with all the players to learn more about their personal journeys and to understand what they needed to maximize their potential. He says some players became emotional during these informal chats, thankful for the opportunity to speak about their lives in a sport where people are often treated as numbers, rather than humans. Webb then continued his work on the training field, looking for players who possessed character traits that would enable the team to do something it had never done before: reach a major tournament. Webb says he was surprised by what he saw in those early sessions, as he started to learn more about the culture of the country he was starting to represent. \u201cIt was just quite unique. All the players are the same, whether they\u2019re the biggest stars, they\u2019re all the same, the staff are all the same,\u201d he adds. \u201cThey\u2019re very humble, all of them, very passionate, very sensitive as well. Quite emotional but such pride for their country. I\u2019d never seen that before.\u201d After getting to know the players better, Webb continued to work on the mental aspect of their game, something which may have been a secret weapon in the penalty shootout win against Greece. In training before the play-off campaign, which saw the team beat Luxembourg in the semifinals before knocking out 2004 Euro champion Greece, Webb says the team specifically practiced the walk up to the penalty spot. The infamous few seconds in football can either make or break a player, and Webb believes the more you practice it, the easier it will be. Before the play-off games, Webb also delivered a presentation about focus to the entire squad, something which drew inspiration from elite athletes in other sports, as well as the national team\u2019s own journey. \u201cIt was good to deliver that,\u201d Webb says. \u201cYou could see the players\u2019 faces, a few tears were around. \u201cYou could feel that it was locked in, you know, that everything was calm, pure focus. Training was good. The players were ready.\u201d Now qualified for the tournament in Germany, Georgia is ready to continue surprising people when competition gets underway. The team boasts a selection of real talent, led by the likes of Napoli winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia. Despite being an underdog in the tournament, Webb is confident this team can compete in its group alongside Turkey, Portugal and Czech Republic. \u201cWe\u2019re not there just to be tourists,\u201d he says, leaning on similar comments made by Sagnol earlier in the year. \u201cWe want to go and compete and give our best. We think we\u2019ve got a fighting chance within the group to maybe progress to the next round. We\u2019re not going in there just to take part. \u201cWe looked at our squad, we looked at the other squads and we think, you know, we can be seriously competitive here.\u201d Georgia\u2019s first game will come against Turkey on June 18. On a personal note, though, Webb can scarcely believe the direction his life and career have taken after that chance encounter with Sagnol all those years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s quite surreal,\u201d Webb says, eyes full of excitement at the prospect of coaching Georgia at the pinnacle of European football.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/sport/euro-2024-georgia-underdogs-coach-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "sports"}}

The league also did not find any evidence games worked by Hoberg were \u201ccompromised or manipulated in any way\u201d but added \u201cdiscipline was warranted.\u201d \u201cMr. Hoberg has chosen to appeal that determination,\u201d MLB said in a statement. \u201cTherefore, we cannot comment further until the appeal process is concluded.\u201d In a statement to USA Today, Hoberg said he is appealing the discipline. \u201cI am appealing Major League Baseball\u2019s determination that I should be disciplined for violating the sports betting policies. While that appeal is pending, it would not be appropriate to discuss the case,\u201d he said. \u201cThat said, I have devoted my adult life to the profession of umpiring, and the integrity of baseball is of the utmost importance to me. I look forward to the appeal process, and I am grateful that the Major League Baseball Umpires Association is supporting me in the appeal.\u201d CNN has been unable\u00a0to reach the MLB Umpires Association or Hoberg for comment. Hoberg started umpiring Major League games during spring training in 2014 and was promoted to the full-time Major League umpiring staff in 2017. The disciplinary action comes a little over a week after San Diego Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano was banned for life\u00a0by the\u00a0league for betting on baseball games. Four other players were also banned for a year apiece for violating betting rules. The MLB investigation said \u201cthere is no evidence to suggest \u2014 and Marcano denies \u2014 that any outcomes in the baseball games on which he placed bets were compromised, influenced, or manipulated in any way.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/sport/mlb-discipline-umpire-pat-hoberg-gambling-investigation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_sport_christian-eriksen-goal-denmark-euro-2024-cardiac-arrest-euro-2020-spt-intl", "text": "Christian Eriksen scored Denmark\u2019s opening goal at Euro 2024 against Slovenia - and it\u2019s one that will likely feel extra special. Just three years ago, Eriksen collapsed on the pitch after suffering cardiac arrest during Denmark\u2019s group match against Finland at Euro 2020, which was delayed by a year due to the Covid-19\u00a0pandemic. The Danish captain received life-saving treatment on the pitch, eventually being resuscitated and taken to hospital. Exactly 1,100 days after the incident, Eriksen produced a brilliant finish to give Denmark the lead against Slovenia, taking Jonas Wind\u2019s clever back-heel on his chest before volleying into the bottom corner. The image of Eriksen celebrating his goal \u2013 a huge grin plastered across his face \u2013 was in stark contrast to the distressing scenes at Euro 2020. That day, his Denmark teammates stood around Eriksen arm-in-arm as he received treatment, trying to shield him from the cameras and supporters in the stands. There was relief around the stadium - and around the world - when a conscious Eriksen waved to the crowd as he was being stretchered off the pitch. \u201cWell, what should I say? He was gone,\u201d Morten Boesen, Denmark\u2019s team doctor, said the following day. \u201cWe did cardiac resuscitation and it was cardiac arrest. How close were we? I don\u2019t know.\u201d After receiving life-saving treatment on the pitch, Eriksen was subsequently fitted with an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) device \u2013 a type of pacemaker intended to prevent fatal cardiac arrests by discharging a jolt to restore regular heart rhythm. Serie A club Inter Milan, whom Eriksen had been contracted to at the time of the incident, told him that he would be allowed to move abroad in order to continue his football career, with the midfielder unable to play in Italy unless the ICD device was removed. Eriksen started training with former club\u00a0Odense Boldklub\u00a0in Denmark, before moving to Brentford on a free transfer in January 2022 and then Manchester United, where he currently plays. Eriksen\u2019s brush with death has made the midfielder remarkably philosophical and reflective  about life and living. \u201cI\u2019ve learned that even after a bad time, there\u2019s always a time after where everything will be different,\u201d Eriksen told CNN Sport\u2019s Amanda Davies after receiving the Comeback of the Year award at the Laureus Sports Awards in Paris last yaer.  \u201cOne of the first quotes I heard was that even if you feel good, you\u2019re going to feel bad, you\u2019re going to feel good again. It\u2019s just going to go up and down \u2013 time is your best friend.\u201d Denmark was unable to build on Eriksen\u2019s goal and thanks to Slovenia defender Erik Jan\u017ea\u2019s deflected shot in the 77th minute, the Group C game ended in a 1-1 draw. Serbia vs. England In Group C\u2019s second game on Sunday, England earned an unconvincing 1-0 win over Serbia thanks to Jude Bellingham\u2019s first-half header. Serbia barely had a touch of the ball inside the opening 10 minutes, struggling to get into the game as England passed the ball between themselves with ease. England was similarly dominant in possession against Iceland in the final friendly before the start of Euro 2024, but an insipid performance ended with the visitor earning a famous victory at Wembley. But Gareth Southgate\u2019s side was playing with an obvious vigor in the early stages against Serbia, snapping into challenges and passing the ball around with purpose. It wasn\u2019t long before England took a deserved lead, as Bellingham timed his late run to perfection to get in front of his defender and head Bukayo Saka\u2019s deflected cross past Predrag Rajkovi\u0107 in the Serbia goal. Bellingham was evidently fired up by his goal. Soon after, the Real Madrid midfielder waved his arms towards the crowd to gee up the England fans after putting the ball out for a throw-in, before barging Filip Kosti\u0107 in the chest as he walked away \u2013 much to the Serbian winger\u2019s annoyance. England was given a warning \u2013 if it needed one \u2013 of just how quickly the game can change when an error from Trent Alexander-Arnold gifted Aleksandar Mitrovi\u0107 possession, but the Al Hilal striker flashed his effort a fraction wide of the post. That hairy moment aside, it was an extremely assured first half from England. Kyle Walker should have made it 2-0 when he was through on goal, but decided to cross the ball when perhaps shooting was the better option. The second half, however, was decidedly less comfortable for England. Serbia began to grow into the game and had England pinned back into its own penalty box for long periods, but a lack of any quality in attack meant clear cut chances were few and far between. Harry Kane had the best chance of the second half but his header was brilliantly tipped onto the crossbar by Rajkovi\u0107, who celebrated his save as though he had won Euro 2024 England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford had to be alert in the closing stages to turn Du\u0161an Vlahovi\u0107 vicious long-range strike over the bar, but that was the closest Serbia got to an equalizer. The Three Lions are rarely swashbuckling in tournament football but Southgate will have plenty to think about after that second-half performance before his team faces Denmark on Thursday. There had been security concerns ahead of the game. On Saturday, there were chants of \u201910 German bombers\u2019 \u2013 a reference to World War II \u2013 from some England supporters in D\u00fcsseldorf on Saturday, with journalist Matt Lawton posting a video that showed one fan holding an inflatable plane outside of a pub. There were also clashes between Serbia and England fans as they made their way to the stadium on Sunday. Gelsenkirchen police said in a statement that around 4,000 Serbian fans marched towards the Veltins-Arena in a \u201clargely peaceful\u201d manner, but had to be stopped \u201cseveral times along the way because pyrotechnics were set off.\u201d \u201cAt around 3:45 p.m., the police were informed of a confrontation between Serbian and English football fans in the area of Arminstrasse,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cRiot police officers separated the two fan camps. They took seven Serbian supporters into custody and filed a criminal complaint for grievous bodily harm. \u201cThere were no further incidents on the way to the arena. There is a lively atmosphere around the stadium. The police are on site and are keeping an eye on the situation.\u201d There were more positive chants from England fans in the Arena AufSchalke during Sunday\u2019s game, notably when they erupted into a rendition of The Beatles\u2019 \u201cHey Jude,\u201d celebrating the 20-year-old\u2019s goal, while after the final whistle was blown \u201cSweet Caroline\u201d \u2013\u00a0another fan anthem \u2013 echoed around the stadium.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/sport/christian-eriksen-goal-denmark-euro-2024-cardiac-arrest-euro-2020-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "sports"}}

It seemed not just unlikely but almost impossible, a pipedream that had a 0.02% chance of coming true, according to stats website data golf, requiring some perfect mixture of luck and skill to produce a miraculous shot on his last hole under the most intense pressure. But Molinari took out his seven-iron on the 194-yard par-three ninth, and his shot landed on the edge of the green before rolling all the way into the hole as he staggered to the side and dropped his shoulders in disbelief. \u201cWhat are the chances, really? I don\u2019t even know what to say,\u201d the 41-year-old Italian told reporters afterward. \u201cJust incredible.\u201d After his hole-in-one, Molinari finished on five-over-par at Pinehurst No. 2 in North Carolina, sneaking inside the cut at the last opportunity. And the 2018 Open Championship winner admitted that he had thought almost all hope of staying in the tournament was lost when he bogeyed the eighth leaving himself with two shots to make up on the last hole. \u201cI just bogeyed eight,\u201d he said. \u201cI was hoping I was able to par eight and then having to make two at nine. With that flag, if you hit a good shot, you can get it within birdie range, but when I dropped a shot at eight \u2026 Standing on the ninth tee it was just put a good swing on it and see what happens.\u201d His playing partners Min Woo Lee and Sergio Garcia celebrated with him as he made the cut for only the second time from eight tournaments on the PGA Tour this year. \u201cSergio was walking in front of me and he raised his hands when the ball was still five meters from the hole and I wanted to tell him, \u2018Come on, don\u2019t jinx me,\u2019\u201d Molinari told Sky Sports. \u201cI haven\u2019t been making a lot of cuts in the last few weeks, I\u2019ve been there or thereabouts and just falling short so it\u2019s nice to see one going my way. Hopefully the first of a few,\u201d he added. The ninth hole proved lucky for Austria\u2019s Sepp Straka too as he made his first ace on the PGA Tour earlier that day, and also made the cut at two over. Molinari teed off for the third round at 8:55 a.m. ET on Saturday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/sport/francesco-molinari-hole-in-one-us-open-cut-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_sport_carlos-alcaraz-french-open-tennis-spt-intl", "text": "As a child, Carlos Alcaraz used to run home from school to watch the French Open on TV, dreaming of one day playing on the tournament\u2019s clay courts and becoming champion. That dream became a reality on Sunday as the Spaniard defeated world No. 4 Alexander Zverev in five sets to lift his third grand slam title \u2013 all at the age of only 21. In a gritty and often unpredictable performance on Court Philippe-Chatrier, Alcaraz showed his trademark fight and resilience against Zverev, coming back from two sets to one down to become the youngest man to win major titles on clay, grass and hard courts. \u201cHonestly, first of all, I\u2019m exhausted,\u201d Alcaraz told CNN Sport\u2019s Amanda Davies the day after claiming his first title at Roland Garros. \u201cIt was a really tough one. It is a dream come true for me. I really wanted to lift this trophy one day, and then to be able to do it is a great feeling. \u201cThis tournament, I\u2019ve watched it since I was five, six years old \u2026 Being in this position right now is so, so special,\u201d he added. With Alcaraz\u2019s latest success comes yet another tattoo. He already has the dates of his grand slam wins at the US Open and Wimbledon \u2013 the latter alongside a strawberry synonymous with the tournament \u2013 inked on his skin, and now plans to get the Eiffel Tower and Sunday\u2019s date on his left ankle. It seems a fitting choice: after his victory in the City of Light, Alcaraz shared an old photo of himself aged 12, watching the tournament on a big screen in the shadow of the Paris landmark. Is he worried about running out of skin space, should he continue to accumulate more grand slam titles? \u201cThis is good news if that happens,\u201d said Alcaraz. \u201cI said to my family and to my team that it\u2019s going to be the first grand slam. If I win another French Open, I\u2019m not going to get a tattoo.\u201d With his victory over Zverev, the world No. 2 joins a long line of Spanish men to have lifted the French Open title. Rafael Nadal leads the way with a record-breaking 14 titles, while Juan Carlos Ferrero, Albert Costa, Carlos Moy\u00e1 and Sergi Bruguera have all been champions since 1993. \u201cI really wanted to put my name on that list as well,\u201d said Alcaraz, who is now coached by 2003 winner Ferrero. Having sustained an arm injury ahead of this year\u2019s French Open, the Murcia native withdrew from the Italian Open but has exceeded his expectations physically over the past two weeks, winning four of his seven matches in three sets. It was only against Zverev and new world No. 1 Jannik Sinner that Alcaraz went the distance \u2013 the first man in the Open Era to win the final and the semifinal of the French Open in five sets. After losing the third set against Zverev, letting slip a 5-2 lead, he had to dig deep into his energy reserves and raise his intensity, racing around the court and chasing down every shot. The two highlights were a so-called \u201cbanana\u201d forehand \u2013 made famous by Nadal \u2013 in the fourth set and a stunning backhand passing shot when Alcaraz had seemed certain to lose the point in the deciding set. \u201cIf I lost, I wanted to do it fighting until the last ball, running, playing my best tennis,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I thought about in that moment: to keep trying to find solutions.\u201d Alcaraz\u2019s attention now turns to Wimbledon, where he will defend the title he won in dramatic fashion against Novak Djokovic last year, and then the Olympics in Paris, which will mean a return to Roland Garros. There, he hopes to play doubles alongside Nadal \u2013 potentially one of the 22-time grand slam champion\u2019s final tournaments \u2013 as well as going for a gold medal in the singles competition. \u201cI\u2019ve won Roland Garros and I\u2019m going for the Olympics,\u201d said Alcaraz. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to get both.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/sport/carlos-alcaraz-french-open-tennis-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "sports"}}

There was no Tiger Woods teeing off on Saturday, which perhaps doesn\u2019t come as a great surprise these days, after he missed the cut \u2013 but others failed on the fast and firm greens too, such as Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson, Justin Thomas, Viktor Hovland, Justin Rose, Rickie Fowler, Webb Simpson and Jason Day, to name a few. Major winners, all-time greats and two of the world\u2019s top 10 struggled on the North Carolina course on the first and second day. Even world No.1 Scottie Scheffler \u2013 a man who had made at least one birdie in his last 168 rounds \u2013 toiled, though at five-over overall he did just make the cut. The most recognizable name on the list of absentees this weekend is Woods, though it has been a number of years since the 48-year-old was a contender at majors. He shot 74 and 73 to finish seven-over overall. The 15-time major champion made it to the weekend at the Masters but has now missed the cut at successive majors after falling away at the PGA Championship last month. When asked by CNN\u2019s Patrick Snell if he might have played his last US Open, Woods cast doubt on his future at the tournament and also at the Open Championship in the UK. World No.5 Hovland missed the cut by a shot with his six-over overall, while world No.10 Homa also saw his championship end early. According to the US Open, some players are drawing \u2018X\u2019 on their yardage book on the holes they should not miss the green, given how difficult some are playing. Former world No.1 and two-time major winner Thomas was 11-over overall, but even further behind him on the leaderboard was Mickelson on 15-over overall. Australian Day, a former world No.1, seemed comfortably on course to play beyond the halfway stage, but a dreadful final nine in his second round, where he shot a 41 \u2013 carding five bogeys and double bogey in his second round - saw him drop to eight over.

{"id": "2024_05_10_sport_hattan-alsaif-mma-saudi-arabia-spt-intl", "text": "Hattan Alsaif has grown accustomed to sparring with men. Rarely shy about confronting heavier, stronger opponents, she knows what it\u2019s like to absorb blow after blow until tears begin to shine in her eyes, her face red and hot from crying. As one of the few women at her gym in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia \u2013 and the only woman hopeful of fighting at an elite level \u2013 Alsaif had little choice but to train with and against her male counterparts when she first took up martial arts. She credits her sometimes brutal introduction to the sport as one of the reasons for her success. \u201cI was the only girl doing it day and night, day and night, day and night,\u201d Alsaif told CNN Sport. \u201cI always spar with guys, I train with guys, I\u2019m always with the guys in the gym. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy thing, so when it comes to the cage, when I get a hit from a girl, I feel like, \u2018Whoa, is this all you\u2019ve got?\u2019\u201d The 22-year-old had already made history in MMA, even before her atomweight bout against Egypt\u2019s Nada Faheem on Friday, which she won by knock out in the second round. In January, Alsaif signed a contract with the Professional Fighters League (PFL), making her the first woman from Saudi Arabia to join a global MMA promotion. It was a notable moment in a country known for its socially conservative attitudes, where sporting opportunities have historically been limited for women. The Saudi women\u2019s soccer team only played its first match two years ago, while a domestic soccer league wasn\u2019t established until 2020. Alsaif is acutely aware of her status as a trailblazer for female MMA fighters in Saudi Arabia and takes such a responsibility seriously. \u201cIt\u2019s big, to be honest, because I\u2019m going to be carrying this thing my entire life,\u201d she said, speaking to CNN before her MMA debut fight on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit heavy to carry it, but I\u2019m excited and proud to be the person to do it.\u201d Alsaif endured a difficult upbringing, orphaned at the age of 10 after both of her parents died in a short space of time. She says she battled depression during her teenage years before finding solace in martial arts, helping her to discover a sense of purpose and peace. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a normal childhood or an easy childhood because of the loss of my parents,\u201d said Alsaif. \u201cBut after God, martial arts helped me a lot \u2013 so, so, so much. It changed my life 100% for the better. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m so addicted to martial arts. I don\u2019t want to stop doing [it] because it\u2019s just the thing that makes me feel alive. I feel I\u2019m alive when I train, when I fight, in the gym \u2013 I can feel my soul alive. \u201cWhen I breathe after the rounds, when I feel sick, when I feel tired, when I feel courage, when I feel scared, those moments, every part of that, it makes me feel alive. It\u2019s something that means a lot to me.\u201d Growing up, Alsaif had always loved extreme, adrenaline-fueled sports, and her curiosity to try something new took her to a boxing gym in her local neighborhood. That piqued her interest, but she soon found that the boxing class she was attending lacked rigor and professionalism. Then, after seeing videos of Saudi MMA fighter Abdullah Al-Qahtani on social media, the pair exchanged messages and Alsaif was invited to try the sport for herself. \u201cI started looking at the guys, and they were hitting the bags with kicks and elbows and knees,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI was like, they have more weapons than I do. I only have hands [in boxing]. I felt so jealous \u2026 I love to do the things that have more power.\u201d Alsaif started to compete in Muay Thai \u2013 the stand-up, striking combat sport originating in Thailand \u2013 and went on to win titles at the World Combat Games, the Saudi Games and the International Federation of Muaythai Associations (IFMA) World Championships under the guidance of coach Feras Sadaa. Sadaa, coach of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Muay Thai national team, has been central to Alsaif\u2019s success, though his influence extends far beyond a sporting sphere. \u201cAll these years, I never felt what [having a] father means at all,\u201d said Alsaif. \u201cAnd he was a gift from God. He did everything with me. He helped me in every situation, in the gym or outside of the gym. \u201cHe was like family. He always told anyone else that Hattan is not just my student, Hattan is one of my kids \u2026 I wish to make him so happy [and] represent him in the best way I can.\u201d Friday\u2019s fight card in Riyadh, headlined by Al-Qahtani, was Alsaif\u2019s first chance to assess whether she was able to translate her Muay Thai prowess into success in an MMA cage. The event, part of the PFL\u2019s growing prominence in the region, featured fighters from across the Middle East and North Africa, less than three months since Claressa Shields and Kelsey De Santis contested the first professional female MMA bout in Saudi Arabia. Last year, SURJ Sports Investments Company, which is owned by Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF), acquired a minority stake in the PFL, part of the PFL\u2019s strategy to recruit more fighters and attract more fans in the MENA region. Alsaif never envisioned herself becoming an MMA pioneer when she took her first curious steps into a combat gym, but said that she wants to leave a legacy in the sport. Her upcoming bout is the first step towards achieving that goal and also an opportunity to reflect on all that she has overcome during her short time as an MMA fighter.

Spain\u2019s Lamine Yamal made history on Saturday by becoming the youngest player to appear at a men\u2019s European Championship when he took to the field against Croatia at Euro 2024. At 16 years and 338 days old, Yamal surpassed the previous record set by Poland\u2019s Kacper Koz\u0142owski, who was 17 years and 246 days old when he played against Spain at Euro 2020. Yamal marked his record-breaking appearance against Croatia with an assist in the first half, crossing the ball into the box for Dani Carvajal to poke home en route to a crucial 3-0 Group B win. Yamal already holds the records for being the youngest player to feature for Barcelona and the youngest player to start a match in La Liga in the 21st century. In his first season in Bar\u00e7a\u2019s senior team, Yamal made 37 appearances in La Liga and 10 in the Champions League, finishing the campaign with seven goals and 10 assists in all competitions. Widely considered one of football\u2019s most promising young players, both the Blaugrana and Spain have high hopes that the teenager can help lead them to trophies in the near future. It\u2019s certainly a lot of pressure to put on such slight shoulders, but Yamal has already proven this season, notably with some standout performances in the Champions League, that he has no fear of the biggest stage. \u201cI think he\u2019s so mature and can already make the difference for us,\u201d former Bar\u00e7a head coach Xavi recently told reporters of Yamal. \u201cWe have to take care of him, but I think he\u2019s ready and I\u2019m not afraid to trust youth.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/sport/lamine-yamal-youngest-player-euros-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2022_07_25_sport_black-representation-swimming-equality-spt-intl", "text": "Omie Dale has fond memories of splashing in the sea as a child, of racing through water parks and swimming in backwaters and rivers.   \u201cThere\u2019s so much joy that can be had once you learn to swim, once you\u2019ve abandoned those fears and you can get in the water,\u201d the 25-year-old Dale, who is based in southeast London, tells CNN Sport.  Even though swimming is a joyful experience for Dale, the stark reality is that many Black communities in Britain and the US do not have safe access to swimming lessons and public pools due to historic racism and segregation \u2013 a problem that is especially alarming given that, as Dale says, it is \u201cthe only sport that can save your life.\u201d  A history of exclusion The lack of access afforded to Black communities in Britain is what motivated Dale to become a swimming teacher in September 2019.  \u201cI used to work in Kensington (in London) as a lifeguard and some of the richest people live in that borough, but also some of the poorest,\u201d she says. She saw there was a difference when private schools and independent schools would come in and all the kids were able to swim, yet hardly any children of the same age that Dale saw from state schools could swim 25 meters.  \u201cThere\u2019s a real class barrier in the sport of swimming,\u201d Dale adds.   She is a director of Swimunity, a collective offering free swimming lessons to women and children in North Kensington, West London. It was born in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster in 2017, when a residential block caught on fire, killing 72 people \u2013 and leaving many more without homes.   \u201cThere\u2019s like a lot of people who come to swim lessons \u2026 who have undergone some form of trauma, whether that be water-related trauma or trauma related to their everyday lives,\u201d Dale says.   \u201cMany people say it\u2019s like an escape from their daily lives or is, actually, the first time that they\u2019ve taken time for themselves.\u201d  While 77% of children from the most affluent families in England can swim 25 meters unaided, only 34% from the least affluent families can, according to a 2021 survey from Sport England, a non-departmental public body that fosters grassroots sports in England.  About 95% of Black adults and 80% of Black children in England do not regularly participate in swimming, according to Sport England\u2019s report, published in January 2020. Likewise, about 93% of Asian adults and 78% of Asian children, including those with Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi heritage, do not regularly participate in swimming, the same research found. This trend extends to the US, where nearly 64% of Black children have \u201clow\u201d or no ability to swim, compared with 40% of their White peers, according to 2017 data from the country\u2019s national governing body for the sport at a competitive level, USA Swimming.   The underrepresentation of Black people in the pool in the US can be traced back to the early 20th century.   Public swimming pools became popular in North America in the 1920s and 30s and were initially open to all. However, Northern politicians stipulated a \u201cWhites Only\u201d rule, referencing racist fears about Black men fraternizing with White women.   Even after legal racial segregation ended in the US in 1964, public pools continued to be hostile environments. As people of color began to use public pools, White swimmers retreated to the privacy of their own pools and private clubs, where expensive fees continue to be an economic barrier for Black families who cannot afford the cost.    Similar examples in Britain illustrate how racial and class inequalities lead to the systemic exclusion of Black people in pools. For example, more than 4.2 million people in the UK live in ethnically diverse communities where Covid-19 national lockdowns resulted in the closure or mothballing of pools, according to Swim England \u2013 England\u2019s national swimming governing body \u2013 and the Black Swimming Association (BSA), a UK-based charity that aims to encourage more African, Caribbean and Asian communities to take up swimming.  \u2018We cannot keep recovering bodies\u2019  Globally, drowning is the third leading cause of accidental injury-related death and at least 236,000 people die each year from drowning, according to 2019 data from the World Health Organization (WHO). Children are particularly affected, with drowning being one of the top five causes of death for those aged 1-14 years in 48 of 85 countries studied by the WHO.   And while natural disasters and irregular migration are notorious risk factors, so are lower socioeconomic status, lack of higher education and being a member of an ethnic minority, depending on the country, WHO research shows.  \u201cMost drowning incidents happen when people never intend to get into the water in the first place,\u201d says Dale, who was awarded Swim Teacher of the Year by Swim England in 2021.  In December 2019, three members of the same Black British family \u2013 a 53-year-old father and his two children \u2013 died in a swimming pool at a resort in Costa del Sol, Spain, Reuters reported. The father and his 16-year-old son had reportedly leapt into the water to try to save his nine-year-old daughter, who was drowning.   Danielle Obe is the co-founder and chair of the BSA. She told CNN Sport that the Costa del Sol deaths prompted her to establish the BSA in March 2020, alongside Olympic swimmer Alice Dearing, journalist Seren Jones and songwriter, rapper and producer Ed Accura.    \u201cThis was devastating because these families were actually acquainted to me and they were from my local community,\u201d Obe says. \u201c(At) that point, I called Alice and Seren, and I said, \u2018We\u2019ve been talking about doing something for our community. We\u2019ve got to do something. We\u2019ve got to do it now. We cannot keep recovering bodies.\u2019\u201d   \u201cIt\u2019s no longer just about that lack of representation,\u201d Obe adds.   \u201cIt\u2019s now about saving lives, vital water safety, education for all. Swimming is an intervention. Swimming is a life skill.\u201d  However, there is still a lack of data when it comes to drowning-related deaths by ethnicity in the UK, says Obe.  \u201cAt the moment, we don\u2019t know how much of a disparity there is between drowning and fatalities, aquatic fatalities for different communities in the UK because, up until now, drowning data isn\u2019t really captured by ethnicity, which is another point, another issue that the BSA is looking to tackle.\u201d \u2018People just don\u2019t think Black people should swim\u2019  Dearing, the first Black female swimmer to represent Britain at the Olympics when she competed at Tokyo 2020, \u201cimplores\u201d people to learn to swim.   \u201cI have been quite torn between the amazing achievement of being the first Black woman to represent GB in swimming but wanting to be my own person, my own athlete, who\u2019s known for being an athlete and not for her race and her sport combined together,\u201d she tells CNN Sport. \u201cI take the two of them just as they are \u2013 kind of like separate things. I\u2019m trying to be the best athlete and best role model that I can be to show people that they can do the sport, that the sport is for everybody.\u201d At the age of 24, Dearing was making history in Japan and became a beacon of hope for young people \u2013 especially Black girls \u2013 who wanted to break into the sport.   But her personal triumph also drew attention to the institutional access gap for people of color in swimming.    \u201cFortunately, for myself, I haven\u2019t come across any barriers at the level I\u2019m at currently,\u201d Dearing says.   \u201cBut I have faced barriers when I was younger and issues where people just don\u2019t think Black people should swim, or do swim, or think that we\u2019re better suited to other sports and so shouldn\u2019t even learn to swim or attempt swimming in the first place.\u201d  CNN reached out to the International Swimming Federation (FINA), Sport England and USA Swimming requesting a breakdown of Black and ethnic minority participation in swimming at grassroots and professional levels of the sport. However, they told CNN they were unable to provide such data.  FINA \u2013 the global governing body for swimming \u2013 told CNN it does not have a breakdown of the ethnicities of swimmers at a grassroots or elite level.   FINA said in 2021 it allocated $6.6 million towards development programs for distribution among all national federations and continental associations, while also pushing for diversity in the sport through its \u201cSwimming for All, Swimming for Life\u201d program.   \u201cFINA remains fully committed to non-discrimination,\u201d the organization said to CNN in a statement. \u201cFINA continues to work hard to ensure that the global aquatics community is a place where all athletes, coaches and administrators are treated equally. \u201cWork will continue to develop and grow with the support of members of the aquatics community as we strive to be at the forefront of this essential area,\u201d FINA added.    Sport England told CNN in a statement that it is \u201ccommitted to increasing investment in facilities and organisations across England to try to level up access to good quality sports and activities.\u201d \u201cBarriers to getting active persist and have even been exacerbated for some disadvantaged groups \u2013 like women, people with long-term health conditions, disabled people, people from ethnically diverse communities and lower socio-economic groups,\u201d the statement added.   Sport England said in May it announced further funding that brings its total investment in its 121 partners to more than \u00a3550 million ($670 million), which they\u2019ve selected \u201cdue to their unique position to tackle entrenched activity inequalities and influence positive change throughout the sector, their own networks and beyond.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s not all about the economic side of things. It is also about getting people to feel comfortable with putting their kids in swim lessons and in competitive swimming so that they can then go and do other aquatic-based sports,\u201d Joel Shinofield, the managing director of sport development at USA Swimming, told CNN during a phone call.  USA Swimming is a membership-serviced organization that has over 3,100 clubs and more than 400,000 members, according to the official website.   \u201cOur goal is to facilitate opportunities and make sure they\u2019re good ones. While our clubs are the ones that do that on the local level, the resources, guidance, support, financial investment that we provide can shift who those opportunities can be provided to and more broadly create access,\u201d he added.   Shinofield said that USA Swimming has established a 10-year initiative that will grant $1 million to develop learn-to-swim and competitive opportunities for communities served by Historical Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The program was announced in 2021, according to the USA Swimming official website.   Serving underrepresented communities  From representing their organization at the UK\u2019s first Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Summit For Sport in Birmingham, England earlier this year to facilitating swimming classes in Hackney \u2013 one of the most deprived boroughs in London \u2013 Obe hopes that the BSA will help bridge the barrier through community-level engagement.   \u201cThat community engagement really is to build trust, accountability and collaboration with disenfranchised communities and the sector,\u201d says Obe.  \u201cOnly in understanding these attitudes and understanding some of the barriers that preclude our communities from engaging in aquatics can we begin to drive change.\u201d  In August 2021, the BSA announced it would conduct a research program with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the University of Portsmouth, exploring the behaviors and barriers that prevent African, Caribbean and Asian communities from swimming.    Speaking about the program, Obe says: \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to inspire confidence with African, Caribbean and Asian communities, and the only way we\u2019re able to do that is to ensure that we understand where these communities are in the first place and understand why they don\u2019t engage in aquatics, why we don\u2019t see the representation pool side and why we don\u2019t even see the representation within some aquatic organizations.\u201d  Dale also volunteers with Mental Health Swims, a grassroots organization that facilitates swimming meet-ups for people struggling with their mental health. As part of her work for the organization, she coordinates swim events in south London to help swimmers access the mental health benefits of the sport. She also volunteers for Pride in Water, a network that aims to increase LGBTQ+ representation in swimming.   \u2018The future is bright\u2019  Dearing says that despite the racial and economic barriers to swimming for African, Caribbean and Asian communities, she\u2019s still optimistic about the changing landscape of the sport.  \u201cI really think if anything is going to change, it\u2019s going to be now, it\u2019s going to be over the next couple of years,\u201d she says. \u201cEach story is different, each person is different and has to be understood in their own way, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, that\u2019s just another challenge that we have to face and we\u2019re up for it.  \u201cIt\u2019s tough \u2013 it\u2019s not a quick fix, but the future is bright.  \u201cI like to feel that I\u2019m giving something back to swimming and, hopefully, giving something to the Black community to hopefully achieve, strive for and change the way that Black people are viewed in swimming and the way Black people view swimming.  \u201cIt\u2019s a double-edged sword; I absolutely love doing it. Sometimes, it\u2019s really frightening and daunting, but if I\u2019m trying to make the world a better place, then sometimes you got to step out and scare yourself.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/07/25/sport/black-representation-swimming-equality-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "sports"}}

{"id": "2024_05_23_sport_kathleen-noble-rowing-uganda-paris-olympics-spt-intl", "text": "From learning how to row in boats patched together with duct tape to competing at the world championships in a different sport entirely, Kathleen Noble\u2019s rise to the apex of rowing has certainly been unconventional. Her journey now sees the 29-year-old set to become a two-time Olympian \u2013 Noble represented Uganda at the Tokyo Games \u2013 when she competes at Paris 2024. She is Uganda\u2019s first Olympic rowing participant, as well as the African nation\u2019s first and only White Olympian across any sporting discipline. A prodigious swimmer in her youth, Noble represented Uganda at the 2012 World Swimming Championships at just 17 years of age. Then, on a whim during her time as a student at Princeton University, Noble was convinced to try her hand at rowing. \u201cWhen I took my first steps into the sport, I had no thoughts or intentions of competing at a high level and certainly couldn\u2019t have imagined that this would be the direction that things would go,\u201d Noble tells CNN Sport. \u201cTo be honest, it is still a bit surreal to be competing on a stage like this. I don\u2019t think it was until they actually told me that Uganda wanted to send me to the Olympic qualifiers that I really thought, \u2018Oh, okay, maybe there\u2019s something here.\u2019\u201d Equipment issues The sport of rowing is still very much in its nascent stages across many parts of Africa, including Uganda. It was properly introduced to the country back in 2009 when the World Rowing Federation sent out a shipment of donated boats to help to grow a sport which carries with it significant financial entry barriers. It was on these boats that Noble learned to row skull (individual), as opposed to her time rowing crew (as a team in one boat) at university. Whilst the thought of training on Lake Victoria, one of Africa\u2019s Great Lakes and the world\u2019s largest tropical lake, may bring with it a sense of charm and serenity, trying to prepare to compete at Olympic level just isn\u2019t feasible given the lack of opportunities and investment afforded to rowing within Uganda, a reality which sees Noble now train out of Tennessee under former US rower James Martinez. \u201cThere is no history of rowing in Uganda. I mean, I\u2019m literally the first person, male or female, to even qualify for the Olympics,\u201d Noble says. \u201cIt is still extremely niche, and the community is very small. I probably know every single rower in the country personally. \u201cBack in 2016, I took eight months off from university to row in Uganda and I\u2019m so grateful that I did because I got to experience first-hand all the struggles that rowers back home go through on a daily basis. \u201cNot only is there a lack of competition and adequate coaching, but there is a lack of most basic essentials, such as having properly functioning equipment. \u201cWhen I was rowing on Lake Victoria, we were still using the boats donated back in 2009. We would be duct-taping them and trying to get people to patch them up with fiberglass for us.\u201d It is not just a lack of equipment which has hampered rowing\u2019s growth in the east African country. Governance is also a major issue, and the absence of proper oversight has seen many athletes leave the sport in recent times, according to Noble, due to \u201cpromises being made but not always being kept.\u201d The only way the sport has a chance to progress is through the help and funding from outside donors such as the World Rowing Federation. Muhumuza Rodrick Chandi,\u00a0the technical director of the Uganda\u00a0Rowing Federation, tells CNN Sport that the price of equipment and a lack of coaches has been an issue in the country. \u201cIt is true that there is a lack of coaches as most qualified ones have left Uganda in search of greener pastures,\u201d he says.\u00a0\u201cRowing, like most sports in Uganda, is voluntary, so once these coaches get better opportunities they migrate or leave the sport altogether. \u201cThe Ugandan Rowing Federation does suffer from a lack of funding, mainly because it doesn\u2019t get much budgetary support from the National Council of Sports as it\u2019s considered a small sport.\u201d \u2018Honor\u2019 representing Uganda Born in Nakaseke, central Uganda, in 1994, Noble is the daughter of Irish missionaries. \u201cUganda was a fantastic place to grow up in many ways, whether it be the great weather all year round or the friendly and cheerful nature of the people,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut as a White, blonde child, I maybe would have had an aversion to going out in public due to the amount of attention I\u2019d have gotten.\u201d Despite her differences, of which Noble is acutely aware, sport has allowed her to form a deeper connection with her birthplace. \u201cEven though I have Ugandan citizenship, there is an identity to being Ugandan which is about coming from one of the local tribes and having land and a history and ancestors going back a long way,\u201d she says. \u201cI respect that, but at the same time, I did grow up in Uganda. It\u2019s a place that is important to me and it does mean a lot to me to have people accept me as being Ugandan. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge honor to represent my country. It\u2019s been the way that I\u2019ve felt the most connection to my identity as a Ugandan. Growing up there, when people ask you where you\u2019re from, I would say Ireland, even though I was born and grew up there. \u201cBut I feel like as I\u2019ve gotten deeper into representing and rowing for the country, I have felt more strongly that I am Ugandan.\u201d Noble\u2019s acceptance by Ugandan sports fans has also been a great source of encouragement. While she says that she will occasionally receive the odd message on social media criticizing her for representing the country, the overwhelming majority of both fan and media messaging has been support and pride for raising the profile of Ugandan rowing. \u201cYou\u2019re always going to have haters and people who want to try to knock you down, that\u2019s kind of to be expected in high level sport nowadays with social media \u2026 but I find it extremely touching that whenever I am met with negativity, a barrage of positivity will follow,\u201d says Noble. \u201cI\u2019m very, very grateful for that.\u201d Platform for change Noble, on top of her sporting ambitions, works as a software engineer in Tennessee and, alongside her husband, is a homesteader with a small-scale farm producing food and animals for themselves. Like every athlete, she hopes that her Olympic journey will culminate atop the podium, but she does also head to Paris with a compelling sense of realism. \u201cRowing is not really a sport where you wake up and just have a great day and row faster than you ever have before,\u201d says Noble. \u201cIt is a little bit more deterministic than that. Sports that are really based around cardiovascular strength tend to remove that element of major surprise around results. I\u2019m not going to flat out say that my goal isn\u2019t to medal, but at the same time I need to be realistic.\u201d Winning a medal is not the only means by which you can determine an Olympian\u2019s success, though, with Noble hoping that her exposure during the Games can help to elevate rowing back in Uganda, ensuring that she is no longer its sole representative. \u201cI feel a sense of responsibility to try and help support athletes back home,\u201d she says. \u201cWhether that correlates to me having to do well, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily true.

{"id": "2024_06_14_sport_caitlin-clark-culture-wars-wnba-spt-intl", "text": "As she adjusts to life in the WNBA, rookie phenom Caitlin Clark is also having to navigate becoming a lightning rod for societal discourse. Since bursting onto the WNBA scene after a record-breaking college career, Clark has found herself being used by controversial figures on social media to push their own agendas in American culture wars. On Thursday, the Indiana Fever guard was asked by a reporter to clarify comments she\u2019d made earlier in the day, when she said she \u201ccan\u2019t control\u201d people weaponizing her name in talking about racism and misogyny. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing,\u201d replied Clark ahead of the Indiana Fever\u2019s home game against the Atlanta Dream. \u201cI think everybody in our world deserves the same amount of respect. The women in our league deserve the same amount of respect. So, people should not be using my name to push those agendas. It\u2019s disappointing. \u201cIt\u2019s not acceptable \u2026 this is a league I grew up admiring and wanting to be a part of. Like some of the women of this league were my biggest idols and role models growing up and helped me want to achieve this moment right here I get to play in every single night,\u201d added Clark. While she has helped attract thousands more fans to the WNBA this season, discourse around the 22-year-old Clark often focuses on topics away from the court. Her rivalry with fellow star Angel Reese, for example, has triggered discourse about race in the US. Earlier this month, Reese said of the rivalry with Clark: \u201cPeople are pulling up to games, we got celebrities coming to games, sold out arenas, just because of [the 2023 NCAA championship game]. \u201cAnd just looking at that, I\u2019ll take that role. I\u2019ll take the bad guy role, and I\u2019ll continue to take that on and be that for my teammates.\u201d Reese continued: \u201cI\u2019ll look back in 20 years and be like, \u2018Yeah, the reason why we\u2019re watching women\u2019s basketball is not just because of one person. It\u2019s because of me too,\u2019 and I want y\u2019all to realize that. \u201c \u2018It\u2019s not something I can control\u2019 Earlier on Thursday, Clark was asked whether people using her name in the culture wars was something that bothered her. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I can control,\u201d Clark had initially told reporters. \u201cSo, I don\u2019t put too much time into thinking about things like that.\u201d The response grew the ire of Connecticut Sun guard DiJonai Carrington, who wrote a social media post Thursday criticising Clark, adding that \u201csilence is a luxury.\u201d \u201cDawg. How one can not be bothered by their name being used to justify racism, bigotry, misogyny, xenophobia, homophobia & the intersectionalities of them all is nuts,\u201d Carrington said on X, formerly known as Twitter. Clark has had a mixed start to her WNBA career so far, showing flashes of her brilliance but struggling initially with the physicality of the professional game. The Indiana Fever are set to play Chicago Sky in its next game on Sunday, where Clark will once again reignite her on-court rivalry with Reese. In an interview with USA Today on Wednesday, WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert said the league was \u201cthrilled with the rivalries that are being built.\u2019\u2019 \u201cShe obviously captures a viewer we haven\u2019t had before, which is great,\u2019\u2019 said Engelbert of Clark. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled with Caitlin and the generational players that have come in,\u201d added Engelbert, who referenced the play of rookies Reese and Cameron Brink in her USA Today interview. \u201cLook, apathy is the death of a brand,\u201d continued Engelbert. \u201cNobody\u2019s apathetic about the WNBA because we\u2019ve brought in so many new fans into what we call the fan funnel this year.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/sport/caitlin-clark-culture-wars-wnba-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2023_02_05_sport_head-injury-suicide-female-athletes-intl-spt-cmd", "text": "Kelly Catlin and Ellie Soutter never met, but they had a lot in common.  Both were commanding athletes: Catlin, a US track cyclist, was a three-times world champion and Olympic silver medalist, and Soutter, a snowboarder, was tipped to be one of Team Great Britain\u2019s strongest contenders for the 2022 Winter Olympics, having already won a bronze medal at the 2017 European Youth Olympic Festival.  Both were incredibly smart \u2013 Catlin was studying for a master\u2019s degree in computational and mathematical engineering at Stanford University, while Soutter learned to speak French in about six months, according to her father.   At times they almost seemed superhuman. In 2013, after only three weeks of formal training and having broken her wrist, Soutter became British Champion with her arm in a cast. Meanwhile, Catlin, who had a tenderness for children, once rode 80 miles through sleet and snow to speak to a grade school about her Olympic experience.    Yet these two women\u2019s lives were tragically cut short after they sustained serious head injuries in their pursuit of sporting greatness and then took their own lives. Catlin was 23, while Soutter died by suicide on her 18th birthday.  Females may be more susceptible to concussion, and they also have worse and prolonged symptoms after their injury than men, according to a review of 25 studies of sport-related concussion published in the Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine.  However, women remain significantly underrepresented within sport and exercise science research. This, leading experts warn, means they often do not get the treatment or aftercare they need following a head injury.  Women\u2019s sports have historically not received the same attention or funding as men\u2019s sports, Dr. Ann McKee, Director of the Boston University Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s been shown that women athletes are more likely to get a concussion, they tend to have longer recovery periods,\u201d McKee added. \u201cWe do not have enough information about what happens in the female brain. We don\u2019t know if women are biologically more susceptible to these injuries,\u201d she said, adding that some research suggests the size and musculature of women\u2019s necks could play a part. Kelly  Before becoming a track cyclist, Catlin, a triplet, was a national champion road cyclist and time trial national champion, her father Mark, told CNN. After winning a Canadian international race at 17 she was invited to an Olympic training camp for a try out, where, impressed by her performance numbers, coaches immediately offered her a position on the track pursuit team.  Catlin\u2019s father, Mark, told CNN, that his daughter was \u201cintense\u201d and \u201cambitious,\u201d attributes she channeled into her sporting life. Her life changed irrevocably in January 2019. Practicing fast downhill descents in the hills near Los Angeles, she crashed and went skidding down the road.  Despite suffering road rash, Catlin got back on her bike, and finished the ride. It wasn\u2019t her first crash \u2013 she had experienced 4 or 5 hard crashes before this, her father said, and after the latest, she didn\u2019t have any symptoms at the time.  But soon after, at a World Cup track event in Berlin, Catlin was gripped by a sudden and severe headache.   \u201cShe couldn\u2019t compete,\u201d her father said. \u201cKelly is kind of this stoical individual. And if she\u2019s rolling around on the ground, clutching her head, it has to be a severe thing.\u201d On closer inspection, Catlin\u2019s helmet from LA had dents in it. Her father told CNN that this, coupled with her symptoms, caused her family to become aware she had suffered a concussion, which was later confirmed with a diagnosis from Stanford\u2019s Health Centre.  A concussion is a brain injury which happens after a hit to the head or body causes the brain to move back and forth inside the skull, according to the CDC. When Catlin returned to the US, her father says she was examined by the track training center in Colorado. It was confirmed she suffered a concussion, and a return to training protocol was advised, but not implemented or communicated to her coach, he said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any follow-up from Colorado after this. I believe they assumed she would seek care at Stanford,\u201d he told CNN.  CNN has reached out to Stanford and USA Cycling for comment.  Catlin\u2019s symptoms didn\u2019t improve, and in weekly phone calls with her parents, she admitted she was struggling with schoolwork and was unable to concentrate. Stanford Health Center, having diagnosed Catlin with concussion with ongoing symptoms, recommended that she decrease her training for 2 weeks and then gradually build back up and start sessions with an athletic trainer, medical documents sent to CNN by her father show. She was referred to a concussion specialist, the document adds. She tried to train, but \u201cshe would have to stop because she got a severe headache just from walking,\u201d according to her father. Her heart rate would also accelerate rapidly from even the smallest exertion, leaving her with \u201cno exercise tolerance whatsoever,\u201d he added.  Her injury had other consequences. \u201cAs far as we knew she was never a person that suffered from depression. She had an interesting sense of humor.  She was always upbeat and bubbly about things,\u201d her father told CNN.  \u201cShe basically thought her life was over. She was no longer able to be the athlete that she was, she was failing her teammates. And she wasn\u2019t able to succeed in school now. And I think ultimately, that\u2019s why she took her life, because she thought her life was over,\u201d he added.  At the end of January, Catlin made a serious but non-fatal suicide attempt, and was involuntarily admitted to the locked psychiatric ward at Stanford, her father told CNN. A month after that attempt, she took her own life.     Ellie   Soutter\u2019s father Tony said there were many dimensions to his young daughter \u2013 not only was she an \u201cadrenaline junkie,\u201d but she was \u201cvery conscientious\u201d and excelled in school, even after moving from England to France.   Aged 12, Soutter took up snowboarding at school \u2013 and just months later, she was spotted in her hometown resort of Les Gets and trialed by Team Great Britain in February 2013.  \u201cIt was quite obvious why she kept winning competitions because she just made it easy,\u201d her father said. \u201cShe just made it look graceful and beautiful.\u201d But training took its toll \u2013 Soutter told CNN that his daughter suffered seven major concussions in five years, between 2013 and 2018.  \u201cI was being advised by doctors \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, she\u2019s young enough she\u2019ll bounce back. As she progressed, becoming an elite athlete starting on the World Cup circuit, every time she had another concussion, they got worse, and they took longer to recover from,\u201d he told CNN.     \u201cWith every concussion, with the exception of a few minor knocks, Ellie saw a doctor in person,\u201d he added. \u201cI was always told that she was young enough to bounce back to full health after each case and therefore never consulted with the doctors that I met, about any previous concussions.\u201d But Soutter\u2019s final concussion was so \u201chuge\u201d that she spent two nights in the hospital. \u201cWhen I got there, she didn\u2019t even know who I was or where she was,\u201d her father said. Soutter was then selected for the Junior Snowboard World Championships in New Zealand August 2018.  But a month before the competition, she died by suicide.  Her father said a neurologist conducted a CT scan of her brain and reaction tests three months after her final concussion, but said she was \u201cabsolutely fine\u201d and could continue competing.                                                                                                                                 Like Catlin, Soutter had issues with studying and concentrating, becoming more insular as she suffered from crippling headaches. She also started suffering from insomnia.  \u201cShe would literally sit with the tutor a good month after a concussion, and suddenly, she\u2019d go blind. She\u2019d not be able to see \u2013 everything would go black and dark,\u201d her father said. After missing a flight to snowboard training, Soutter died by suicide on her 18th birthday. Team GB referred CNN to GB Snowsport when approached for comment, adding that Ellie only competed for Team GB at one event.  In order to represent Britain in international competitions, GB Snowsport says athletes or their coaches are required to demonstrate that the athlete has reached established performance criteria, is of the relevant technical ability to compete, and has appropriate medical clearance to compete. A large number of athletes can represent Britain at different levels of international competition but are not part of a programme delivered and overseen by GB Snowsport.  \u201cAs Ellie was not part of the GB Snowsport programme, we were unable to implement a personalised recovery and management programme for Ellie,\u201d a spokesperson for GB Snowsport told CNN in an email. \u201cShe was, however, covered by national policies and protocols around fitness to compete, and would not have been cleared for any activity \u2013 training or competition \u2013 overseen by GB Snowsport without being able to demonstrate appropriate medical sign-off,\u201d they added. The spokesperson for GB Snowsport told CNN: \u201cWe take concussions and head injuries incredibly seriously, and in reviewing contemporaneous records from the time that Ellie was involved in snowsport we are confident that GB Snowsport staff applied and followed every appropriate process.\u201d Catlin and Soutter aren\u2019t the only young sporting women whose lives have been cut short in this way. After 29-year-old Australian rules football player Jacinda Barclay took her life in 2020, post-mortem research by scientists found that she had degradation to her cerebral white matter unusual for someone her age.  \u201cFor someone her age, you would expect to see lovely pristine white matter, and hers looked like she was an old woman in that it was basically degraded,\u201d Michael Buckland, founder and Executive Director of the Australian Sports Brain Bank, who studied Barclay\u2019s brain, told CNN.  \u201cWe haven\u2019t gone back and done specific white matter studies on our donors,\u201d he told CNN, adding that the bank hasn\u2019t done peer reviewed research on this.  \u201cBut what struck me, just as someone that sees a lot of brains \u2013 this is not normal for someone of that age.\u201d  Damage to white matter has been associated with dementia, according to research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.   Opportunities missed Suicide after concussion is rare. However patients diagnosed with concussion or mild traumatic brain injury had double the risk of suicide and a higher risk of suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts than people without brain injuries, a 2018 study from researchers at the University of Harvard published in JAMA Neurology found. Dr. Robert Cantu, clinical professor of neurology at the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at Boston University School of Medicine told CNN that there are several theories as to why incidence of suicide is higher in people who have suffered concussion. One theory, he explained, is that those suffering from persistent post-concussion symptoms may have structural or functional brain damage and could be experiencing \u201cbehavioral dysregulation: short fuse, irritability, [and] can\u2019t suppress impulses the way you normally could.\u201d   With these emotional problems, \u201cthey would be more prone to perhaps do something impulsive, like commit suicide,\u201d Cantu, medical director of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, told CNN. A second theory, Cantu noted, is that post-concussive symptoms prevent people from getting back into their sport and stop them \u201cfrom being the person that they were before their injury.\u201d Neither theory is proven to the exclusion of the other, Cantu said, adding he thinks increased suicidality was \u201ca combined factor involving both in many, if not most cases.\u201d There are also differences in the way brain injuries affect women.  A study of female soccer players across US high schools found they are nearly twice as likely to suffer concussion as their male counterparts, according to research that looked at over 80,000 adolescent athletes, published in the journal JAMA Network Open.  Women remain significantly underrepresented within sport and exercise science research: a 2021 study examining papers from some of the most influential sports medical journals found that only 6% of the studies were solely focused on women, compared with 31% of studies that included just men. Other researchers have pointed to female sex hormones, with risk of concussion changing with hormone levels during a menstrual cycle.  McKee said all athletes can also experience \u201cnon-concussive\u201d injuries: \u201chits to the head that can be of the same magnitude as concussion, but they don\u2019t rise to the level of symptoms for whatever reason, so a player tends to play right through it.\u201d Cumulative exposure to repetitive head impacts \u2013 including concussion and non- concussive injuries \u2013 increases the risk for the neurodegenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known as CTE, McKee said.  The disease, which can only be formally diagnosed with an autopsy, has mostly been seen in either veterans or people who played contact sports, particularly American football, say researchers. The disease occurs when the brain starts to degenerate likely due to repeated head traumas, according to the Mayo Clinic, which notes CTE is \u201cassociated with recurrent concussions.\u201d But scientists aren\u2019t only concerned about concussions.  Previous studies have shown subconcussive head impacts \u2013 repetitive hits to the head and body that do not cause symptoms \u2013 can still result in long-term neurological disease.   According to The Concussion Legacy Foundation, \u201cthe best available evidence suggests that subconcussive impacts, not concussions, are the driving force behind CTE.\u201d There have been cases of CTE discovered in athletes who have never been diagnosed with a concussion, according to the Concussion Legacy Foundation. And other changes in the brain after repetitive head impacts aside from CTE are likely \u201cequally important,\u201d McKee said. \u201cWe also see damage to the white matter. And that appears to be mostly in the frontal lobe, but also in the temporal lobes,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to understand the relationship of those white matter changes to behavioral and mood symptoms, perhaps even suicidality,\u201d she said.  McKee stressed that concussion management is important, but physicians and athletes should also be aware of other injuries. \u201cThe problem is the subclinical hits \u2013 the non-concussive injuries that aren\u2019t detected, you don\u2019t pull the player off the field \u2013 and they can be in the hundreds or even the 1000s in a single season,\u201d she explained. Lack of research  Though a growing body of data suggests women in sport are more likely to sustain a concussion, have more severe symptoms, and to take longer to recover, most sports-related concussions protocols are based on data from men.  In a review in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers looked at 171 concussion studies written since 1967 which are used to inform the most influential consensus and position statements in treating sports-related concussions. Clinicians rely on these documents to guide their medical practice when treating athletes \u2013 but most of the studies are focused on men. Only 1% of them was looking exclusively at concussions in women and 40% of them didn\u2019t have any women in a sample of participants at all.   There is another risk factor for women in sport when they sustain head injuries, Katherine Snedaker, founder and executive director of PINK Concussions, a non-profit dedicated to women\u2019s health and brain injury, told CNN.  There is a gulf of millions of dollars separating women and men when it comes to average annual salaries in most professional sports. Outside of elite sport, Snedaker says, female athletes often don\u2019t have access to the same medical care as men, meaning head injuries aren\u2019t spotted as routinely.   \u201cThey tend to push really hard through the injury,\u201d she said. And many women can\u2019t afford to take time out to recover: even professional athletes will supplement their sports income with other jobs, she added, and many are caregivers. \u201cWhen they really crater, it\u2019s a couple of days or weeks later.\u201d  Snedaker said female athletes often weren\u2019t aware they had suffered a head injury. If they were, she said, there were no appropriate medical or sporting staff to inform. Not enough support The families of Catlin and Soutter feel the young women didn\u2019t get enough support after their injuries. After Catlin\u2019s first suicide attempt, she was released from an involuntary admission to the psychiatric ward after threatening legal action, and a conference between psychiatrists, her coach and her parents.  She attended therapy sessions, which she agreed to attend during the conference, but found \u201cthey were geared toward suicidal freshman with a whole set of different issues than an elite Olympic athlete,\u201d her father told CNN. She got a referral to a sports psychologist that worked with the Stanford athletic department, but the department forbade the psychologist from seeing Catlin because she was not a varsity athlete, her father added.  She contacted the office of a sports psychologist with whom she had developed a rapport while in the hospital \u2013 but, his appointment secretary said he had no openings for six months, her father told CNN.  \u201cWherever she turned she could not find help,\u201d he said, adding that his daughter tried a suicide hotline several times: she was once put on hold and once received no answer. Catlin described his daughter as a \u201cstoic, female warrior type person that isn\u2019t going to admit that she\u2019s struggling.\u201d  \u201cShe needed a sports psychiatrist that really could understand what she was going through and understand the rigors of her life in terms of preparation for competitions and the athletic side of it and what it could potentially do to you.\u201d Her father said a major factor in his daughter\u2019s death was \u201ca lack of communication between the facilities that were involved in Kelly\u2019s care. No one was in charge and they assumed the other institutions were following up when they weren\u2019t,\u201d he added. In a statement sent to CNN, Luisa Rapport, director of emergency communications and media relations at Stanford University did not address any of the specific allegations made by Catlin\u2019s family.  She said while the university does not discuss in the media the details of individual students\u2019 experiences, \u201csupporting the mental and emotional health of students is a critical priority for Stanford.\u201d  \u201cStudents in need of mental health crisis assistance \u2013 including students having suicidal thoughts \u2013 and those who are concerned about students in need of assistance, can contact the University\u2019s Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) 24 hours-a-day, seven days-a-week,\u201d she added. Rapport said that in addition to this, \u201cthere are multiple places where psychological services may be provided for students depending on individualized need and treatment recommendations, including, for example, affiliated hospital services and clinics through Stanford\u2019s Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, and mental health programs and clinicians in the community.\u201d In a statement sent to CNN, USA Cycling said it was \u201cdevastated\u201d by Catlin\u2019s death, adding: \u201cShe brought focus and determination to everything she did, and served as an inspiration to everyone who knew her.  \u201cAs the National Governing Body for the sport of cycling, USA Cycling prioritizes the holistic wellbeing of the riders on the U.S. National Team and has a longstanding commitment to providing both physical and mental health resources to members of the team,\u201d a representative for USA Cycling added.   After his daughter Ellie\u2019s death, Soutter was contacted by the UNITE Brain Bank, who wanted to study her brain as part of their research into CTE. But even in that facility \u2013 the biggest of its kind in the world \u2013 of some 1,300 brains, only 3% belonged to women, Ann McKee, Director of the Boston University Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center told CNN. \u201cWhen I actually started looking into CTE \u2013 all of the work that they\u2019ve done with the footballers in America, she had every single symptom and more,\u201d Soutter told CNN. \u201cIt was quite obvious to me that there was a definite link in her starting to get into dark places and feeling bad and anxious and not sleeping properly. All of those symptoms \u2026 Every one that\u2019s involved in CTE was part of Ellie\u2019s life,\u201d he added. \u201cI truly believe today that my daughter would be alive had I had any inkling, you know, even the smallest bit of information.\u201d Editor\u2019s Note: If you are in the US and you or a loved one have contemplated suicide, call The National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255) to connect with a trained counselor.

{"id": "2024_06_16_sport_bryson-dechambeau-us-open-win-2024-spt-intl", "text": "American Bryson DeChambeau won his second US Open title on Sunday, edging Rory McIlroy in a nerve-shredding finale at Pinehurst No. 2 in Pinehurst, North Carolina. LIV Golf star DeChambeau carded a final round one-over 71 to finish one stroke ahead of his Northern Irish counterpart at six-under overall and add to his first major victory in 2020. It resigned world No. 3 McIlroy to yet another heartbreaking near-miss as his 10-year wait for a fifth major title continues. The 35-year-old played brilliantly to surge from three shots behind to two ahead of DeChambeau, only to miss two putts from inside four feet across the last two holes. Left needing to close with par to win, DeChambeau held his nerve to triumph and exorcise the demons of falling one stroke short of the PGA Championship to compatriot Xander Schauffele last month. With his victory falling on Father\u2019s Day, an emotional DeChambeau began his winner\u2019s speech by dedicating the trophy to his father Jon, who died in 2022. \u201cFirst off I want to say a Happy Father\u2019s Day to every father out there,\u201d DeChambeau said.\u201cThis one is for him.\u201d It makes the 30-year-old the second golfer after last year\u2019s PGA Championship winner Brooks Koepka to win a major after departing the PGA Tour for LIV Golf. Cameron Smith and Jon Rahm joined the Saudi-backed circuit after their victories at the 2022 Open Championship and 2023 Masters respectively. Once maligned by some fans, DeChambeau \u2013 whose personal YouTube channel continues to amass subscribers \u2013 has become a crowd-favorite at the majors this year and further consolidated that reputation at Pinehurst. The California-born golfer mixed thrilling play with regular fan interaction throughout, wooing fans one final time by delivering on his victor\u2019s speech promise to let them touch the trophy and ferrying it around the throngs gathered at the 18th green. \u201cI just can\u2019t thank you guys enough for all the support this week,\u201d he added to the crowd. \u201cYou guys have meant the world to me. You are the best fans in the world and I can\u2019t thank you enough.\u201d The joyous scenes served as a stark contrast to the agony undoubtedly felt by McIlroy, who declined to speak to media after his final round one-under 69. McIlroy has plugged away at ending his major drought with remarkable consistency since his last triumph at the 2014 Open Championship, finishing inside the top-10 on 20 of his 36 subsequent appearances at the four flagship events, including his last five in a row at the US Open. He has been a major runner-up three times before, his most recent to Wyndham Clark at last year\u2019s tournament, but the fourth has the potential to haunt him the most given the context. Three bogeys and a par across his last four holes, compounded by two horror close-range misses, resigned him to a closing 69. Even one stroke better would ultimately have been enough to force DeChambeau into a playoff. McIlroy had made his previous 496 putts from inside three feet before his miss for par at the 16th, according to the PGA Tour. The curtain falls on the 2024 men\u2019s major calendar with the 152nd Open Championship at Royal Troon in Scotland on July 18, where American Brian Harman will seek to defend the Claret Jug. Scheffler endures rare torrid week Scottie Scheffler\u2019s miserable week ended in another birdie-less round as the world No.1 toiled to a tied-41st finish at eight-over par overall, his worst major performance in two years. Five wins in his previous eight starts \u2013 including last week\u2019s Memorial Tournament \u2013 had seen Scheffler arrive at Pinehurst as the overwhelming favorite yet he struggled to cope with the course\u2019s firm and fast greens, the typically unflappable Texan\u2019s frustrations bubbling over as he narrowly scraped under the cut line Friday. A third round one-over 71 meant Scheffler had shot four consecutive rounds over par for the first time in a professional career spanning 120 PGA Tour events, and the unwanted streak extended to five as he signed off with a 72. April\u2019s Masters champion had gone 168 rounds with at least one birdie before his second round 74, and had not finished outside the top-25 at a major since missing the cut at the 2022 PGA Championship. Both streaks had extended through a tied-eighth finish at last month\u2019s PGA Championship, a result achieved despite his arrest and release from jail during the major. \u201cI couldn\u2019t hole anything. I could not see the break on these greens,\u201d Scheffler, who has since seen all charges against him dismissed, told reporters Sunday. \u201cThe greens this week kind of had my number. I felt like I hit a lot of really good putts that did weird things at the cup that I was not expecting them to do.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been on a good stretch of golf,\u201d he added. \u201cHad one tough event following a great event. I\u2019m not really going to look too much into it but focus more on my prep.\u201d Scheffler finished 12 shots behind his compatriots Tony Finau and Patrick Cantlay, who shared third place at four-under overall, one shot behind McIlroy. France\u2019s Matthieu Pavon finished a further stroke back. Unfamiliar territory A virtuoso third round 67 that was as entertaining as it was excellent had rocketed DeChambeau into the final 18 holes with a plush \u2013 yet unfamiliar \u2013 three shot cushion. The Californian had never before held the 54-hole lead at a major championship. Though he had ultimately cantered to victory at Winged Foot six years ago, he had trailed Matthew Wolff by two strokes ahead of the final round before tearing away from his compatriot down the stretch. DeChambeau said Saturday he was aiming to play \u201cboring golf\u201d to get over the line, and looked to be delivering on his plan as he made a steady \u2013 albeit unspectacular \u2013 start with six pars and a bogey through the opening seven holes. Yet that strategy, and his nerve, soon came under enormous scrutiny. Unlike Wolff four years ago, McIlroy was showing no signs of fading. Far from it \u2013 he was catching fire. The steely-eyed Northern Irishman was making a mockery of the firm and fast greens that had humbled so much of the field across the week. After two birdies from beyond 20 feet, McIlroy lasered in his fourth in a five-hole stretch at the 13th. With DeChambeau bogeying the 12th, McIlroy headed to the next tee box with a two stroke cushion. The picture had changed entirely in less than 20 minutes, yet it took the same amount of time for it to reset as DeChambeau capitalized on a bogey from his rival to draw level just two holes later. It set up a climax that would serve as the ultimate test of nerve and DeChambeau blinked first, a birdie opportunity turning into a bogey as his four-foot par putt lipped out of the 15th cup. Incredibly though, McIlroy would mirror the error from even closer range mere moments later to surrender his lead and set in motion a meltdown to rival his infamous collapse at the Masters in 2011. Yet the minor consolation of that spiral at Augusta National was that victory had all but vanished shortly after he made the turn. This time, the nightmare ran on till to the last two-and-a-half feet, as a simple conversion for par at the 18th green would have forced DeChambeau to birdie to avoid a playoff. There was a glimmer of hope as DeChambeau went from a hook into the native area to a bunker, but the American recovered superbly with a stunning 55-yard approach to within four feet of the cup. Watching anxiously on a clubhouse TV, McIlroy could only watch as DeChambeau safely avoided making the same mistake he did.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/sport/bryson-dechambeau-us-open-win-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_sport_chris-birch-nasa-astronaut-cycling-spt-scn-intl", "text": "Scroll through the athlete profiles on the USA Cycling website and you\u2019ll find someone whose favorite movie is listed as \u201cInterstellar\u201d \u2013 Christopher Nolan\u2019s acclaimed sci-fi adventure released in 2014. \u201cI love realistic space movies \u2026 I\u2019m definitely a nerd,\u201d reads Chris Birch\u2019s answer on her profile page. That response proved prescient: shortly after stepping away from her professional cycling career, the Arizona native was selected from more than 12,000 applicants to join NASA\u2019s astronaut class of 2021. As career sidesteps go, it was an unusual one, though Birch had an extensive background in science with degrees in mathematics, biochemistry and molecular biophysics, and a doctorate in biological engineering. The further she progressed with her application to join NASA, the more convinced she became that she had a future in spaceflight. Interviews with panels of current and former astronauts, she thought, were stimulating, not intimidating, and so too were the selection exercises undertaken with other candidates. \u201cI really just had a blast,\u201d Birch tells CNN Sport. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like an interview at all, it didn\u2019t feel like a test. It was just super fun. And it felt like fun and games for me.\u201d It\u2019s now been close to two and a half years since Birch joined NASA, and in that time, she has practiced for space walks, learned to fly T-38 training jets and developed skills needed to operate the robotic arm on the International Space Station. Her training also involved acquiring expeditionary skills, understanding how to operate the complex systems on the space station, and even becoming proficient in Russian, the language needed to fly the Soyuz spacecraft. When she graduated at Houston\u2019s Johnson Space Center in March, the 37-year-old had few qualms about the unexpected U-turn her career had taken, her appetite for spaceflight keener than ever before. \u201cI absolutely would love to explore off this planet,\u201d says Birch. \u201cI think there\u2019s a pretty good shot that I\u2019ll get to go do science aboard the International Space Station, maybe even get to do some wrenching outside and work on making some upgrades. \u201cIt would be an absolute career highlight to be able to go back to the moon as part of one of the Artemis missions and do science on the moon.\u201d Birch left academia in 2018 to pursue a career in professional cycling, going on to win 11 national titles and represent the US at the world championships on several occasions. It was around the time that she was training to make the team for the postponed Tokyo Olympics that Birch applied to join NASA, and when she missed out on selection for the Games, she decided to throw herself wholly into her new pursuit. Despite the evident differences in cycling and spaceflight, she believes that the same sense of curiosity and wonder has motivated her in both disciplines. \u201cI think there\u2019s something really powerful about being surrounded by a group of people that are all trying deliberately to not walk the path most trodden,\u201d says Birch. \u201cWe\u2019re all looking to push the envelope in some way, and that has always been my driving mantra. The whole reason I pursued a PhD is I wanted to discover something, to build something that had never been done before. \u201cMy fascination with sport was all about seeing how fast we could go. Can we push the human body \u2013 my body, my mind \u2013 farther than I thought I could go? It really was a natural extension of that inner drive for me, if not a slight change in the technical topics.\u201d Joining NASA has meant that Birch\u2019s days of flying around a velodrome at lightning-bolt speeds are over, but her desire to test her physical limits remains. She has turned her focus towards endurance challenges, completing the iconic Leadville Trail 100 mountain bike race \u2013 a 100-mile course with 12,000 feet of elevation gain in Colorado \u2013 last year, as well as racing the Houston Marathon in January. On her radar is an attempt to break the women\u2019s time record for cycling north to south across Montana, some 400 miles on gravel roads. Challenges like that are not so far removed from astronaut training, which involves group expeditions in the field, living in the wilderness for days at a time and learning how to handle stress in a critical, unforgiving environment. \u201cCycling in particular \u2013 it just supports so much suffering,\u201d says Birch. \u201cIt\u2019s a really great avenue to practice mental toughness. It doesn\u2019t cost much, versus for me to go out and fly in a multi-engine jet aircraft is thousands of dollars an hour. \u201cThis is something that I can go do and practice that toughness training, especially if I\u2019m descending on a mountain bike trail, six hours in and I\u2019m really tired \u2013 I\u2019m now making critical handling decisions in response to my environment. \u201cI feel like that translates really well to being able to do that in the jet \u2013 it\u2019s the same mental clarity, mental focus you have to maintain. I think it\u2019s an awesome space to practice that.\u201d Birch is now firmly focused on her first projects since graduating. Recently, that\u2019s involved supporting Artemis II recovery training in the Pacific Ocean, off the coast from California. The Artemis II mission, now scheduled for September 2025 after a delay of several months, aims to send four astronauts on a journey to fly by the moon, and being able to prepare for the safe recovery of the astronauts and the capsule, Birch says, gave an \u201cincredible appreciation for the needs of the crew,\u201d even while she\u2019s still a rookie. There\u2019s no obvious timeline or pathway for when or how she might be able to venture away from planet Earth herself, but it remains a firm ambition in her life and career. \u201cI\u2019m going to prepare for that the same way I would prepare for a race,\u201d says Birch, \u201cshow up every day and give 100% to the team. If the timing works out, then that\u2019s great. But I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/sport/chris-birch-nasa-astronaut-cycling-spt-scn-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_sport_diede-de-groot-tennis-unstoppable-force-spt-intl", "text": "It\u2019s one thing to beat the best. It is, however, an entirely different proposition to be the best. To evolve from the hunter and become the hunted \u2013 and not just over the course of a week, month, or perhaps even years. Moreover, to do so over a prolonged period, set against the backdrop of ever-changing competitors, landscapes and the sands of time and physiology. Wheelchair\u00a0tennis player Diede de Groot, though, has been unequivocally the dominant constant in the face of those challenges. \u2018Diede the Great\u2019 \u201cI feel a very big target on my back which is what keeps me motivated,\u201d De Groot told CNN ahead of the French Open. \u201cI know all of these girls are working towards beating me which is fun but intense at the same time. \u201cThey\u2019re not playing with any pressure when they\u2019re playing against me and I have all the pressure because there\u2019s this massive streak that\u2019s following me everywhere. \u201cAt the same time, I really try to forget about all of that and just play tennis.\u201d In a world where we\u2019re inundated daily with statistics ranging from the intriguing to the inane, De Groot\u2019s numbers make for truly remarkable reading. She is the first tennis player \u2013 wheelchair or able-bodied \u2013 ever to win three successive calendar grand slams. She is the first women\u2019s wheelchair tennis player to achieve the Golden Slam \u2013 all four grand slams and a Paralympic gold medal \u2013 in 2021. De Groot is also unbeaten in grand slam tournaments since the 2021 Australian Open, currently boasting a winning streak that has surpassed 130 matches. Based on facts and figures alone, one would be hard pushed to begrudge the 27-year-old for possessing the bold \u2013 yet prophetic and linguistically apt \u2013 social media handle of @DiedetheGreat. \u201cI was too humble to say Diede the Great,\u201d she says smiling. \u201cMy own last name Groot was already taken, so I had to come up with something else and then the literal translation of Groot is great. So that\u2019s how it sort of came to be. \u201cDuring the year, maybe I don\u2019t think about it [records] enough \u2026 especially in tennis because it\u2019s just like a continuous streak of tournaments. It\u2019s difficult to really take time. \u201cBut when I\u2019m just at home sitting, thinking of the amazing things that I\u2019ve already done to this point, I\u2019m very proud of myself.\u201d Wall of Champions So what\u2019s the secret of the Dutch star\u2019s success? \u201cI don\u2019t think I have the biggest serve. I don\u2019t think I have the biggest forehand,\u201d De Groot reflected. \u201cI just think that I\u2019m very good at all of the levels \u2026 I\u2019m a complete player. \u201cI don\u2019t really have a weak point and that\u2019s very difficult for opponents to, to play against.\u201d De Groot\u2019s current grand slam singles tally stands at 21. Her latest victory at this year\u2019s Australian Open was not only a remarkable 13th in a row but it also drew her level alongside the great Esther Vergeer\u2019s grand slam tally. Vergeer\u2019s 21st and final major title came at Roland Garros in 2012. Whilst De Groot still has some way to go to encroach on her compatriots astonishing 470-match unbeaten winning streak, it\u2019s fitting then that she\u2019ll have the chance to become the most successful women\u2019s wheelchair tennis player of all time at this year\u2019s French Open. Victory in Paris would consolidate De Groot\u2019s position as third in the all-time list of overall grand slam champions across singles and doubles. The 27-year-old\u2019s current tally stands at 39. Vergeer finished her career with 42 titles, second only to Japan\u2019s recently retired Shingo Kunieda, the most decorated men\u2019s player in the history of wheelchair tennis, who amassed an astonishing 50 majors. Hotbed of talent Aside from her technical prowess, the foundations of De Groot\u2019s trophy-laden career \u2013 and for that matter her compatriot Vergeer\u2019s \u2013 can also be attributed to the Dutch tennis system. It\u2019s one which allows wheelchair tennis to integrate with able-bodied players, a strategy that has worked to stunning effect. \u201cI started wheelchair tennis when I was seven years old \u2026 I had a few operations done on my hip [and] the rehabilitation center advised me: \u2018Hey, would you like tennis?\u2019 I picked it up, and I loved it straight away,\u201d said De Groot, who was born with unequal leg length. \u201cTo have that feeling that I could play tennis just like all the other kids in the group \u2026 it was very special to have that. \u201cWe are fully integrated into the KNLTB [Royal Dutch Lawn Tennis Association] program. We are treated like athletes [and] being taken seriously really helps taking yourself seriously.\u201d The KNLT\u2019s National Tennis Centre, located in Amstelveen, boasts 14 outdoor and 14 indoor courts with accessibility for wheelchair tennis. \u201cTwenty years ago wheelchair tennis was one of the biggest Paralympic sports in the Netherlands,\u201d says De Groot. \u201cWe already were very lucky to have a very good number one gold medalist [Vergeer] and because we were such a small country, we could all see each other play. \u201cAnd just learning from previous generations \u2026 I could learn from the women that went before me. I could see it from up close and therefore mimic it or even try to do better.\u201d De Groot and Vergeer both herald from the historic Dutch city of Woerden, which has produced a conveyor belt of some of the greatest players from The Netherlands to have ever graced the sport. So is there something special in the Woerden waters. \u201cWe lived very close to each other which is actually quite special,\u201d De Groot says. \u201cAnother world number one \u2013 Jiske Griffioen \u2013 also comes from there. So, it\u2019s just a coincidence \u2026 but it\u2019s a funny coincidence!\u201d \u2018We are being noticed\u2019 Wheelchair tennis events are now gradually being incorporated into a growing number of ATP and WTA events. The prestigious Miami Open hosted an event for the very first time earlier this year and Wimbledon has announced it will double the size of the wheelchair draws for this summer\u2019s tournament. \u201cI would say that from history, Paralympics were always the moment that all eyes were on us,\u201d reflected De Groot. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have to share it with able-bodied athletes. \u201cBut then for another four years, we would sort of fall to the background again \u2026 now I really feel like these players are noticing us. They\u2019re recognizing us and interacting with us more and more. \u201cI saw Jannik Sinner play with our world No. 1 Alfie Hewitt [in Miami]. Novak \u2026 he\u2019s done some really good promotion with Dylan Alcott before so hopefully these moments will be more and more \u201cCountries are developing their programs and players are developing their games. It\u2019s a really fun time to be a wheelchair tennis player.\u201d Paris 2024 When it came to the Covid-impacted Tokyo Games, the Dutch star had an unprecedented weight of history of her shoulders. Dutch women have won every wheelchair tennis title \u2013 singles and doubles \u2013 since it became a medal event 32 years ago. De Groot stormed to singles and doubles gold without dropping a set in either competition. It remains one of the defining moments of her career. \u201cFor a long time, a lot of people ask me that without gold, your career wouldn\u2019t be complete. I never thought about it that way. \u201cWinning gold in Tokyo really felt like it was like a completion of so many years already that I\u2019ve been doing so well. So many things came from winning those medals that it definitely sparked something around me, which is very good.\u201d The Dutch phenom is on track to return to the clay courts of Roland Garros to defend her titles this summer at Paris 2024. It\u2019s a challenge she\u2019s relishing and with her imperious track record to date in the French capital \u2013 winning a total of nine grand slam titles \u2013 you\u2019d be a brave person to bet against her. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a different Paralympics,\u201d she says. \u201c[I] played in Rio. I was very new there. [I] Played in Tokyo. No one was allowed to come and watch and I had all the pressure there. And now I\u2019m a defending champion with everyone there. \u201cIt will mean everything [to defend the titles]. It\u2019s the goal that I\u2019m aiming at. \u201cI still have many tournaments before so my head is not yet there, but it will be and I\u2019m going to enjoy it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/sport/diede-de-groot-tennis-unstoppable-force-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "sports"}}
