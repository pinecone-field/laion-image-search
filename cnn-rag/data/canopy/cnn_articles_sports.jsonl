{"id": "2024_07_08_sport_tahiti-summer-olympics-2024", "text": "The Olympic Games will be chock full of iconic images of Parisian landmarks \u2013 the Eiffel Tower, Versailles, the Pont Alexandre III bridge and H\u00f4tel des Invalides are all set to play a starring role. But one of the most stunning backdrops for the quadrennial competition won\u2019t be in Paris \u2013 or France for that matter. It won\u2019t even be in the same hemisphere. The world-famous waves off Teahupo\u2019o in Tahiti are set to be one of the most scenic and unique locations of the upcoming games, beginning when the island hosts the surfing competition that kicks off on July 27. The selection of Tahiti fulfills one of the pledges from Paris organizers, who promised to spread the Olympics throughout French territory. Tahiti became a French colony in 1880 and is now classified as an autonomous overseas country of the French Republic. While other cities across France are hosting soccer, basketball and other high-profile competitions, the choice to put the surfing competition in the largest island in French Polynesia has made for one of the most unique and controversial venues in this edition of the Olympics. But it\u2019s one that\u2019s well-known in the surfing community, as the swells off of the southwestern coast of Tahiti have long been a part of the stops on the competition circuit. Located roughly 9,700 miles and a 21-hour flight away from Paris, Teahupo\u2019o will make for one of the far-flung host cities for an Olympic event in history. \u201cThis is a magical place, and the waves in Teahupo\u2019o are breathtaking,\u201d said Paris 2024 President Tony Estanguet after a visit to the event site in 2022. \u201cOur vision has always been to provide the most spectacular conditions for the surfers and the sport. I have no doubt that Tahiti will deliver on that vision.\u201d Teahupo\u2019o was selected third on CNN\u2019s list of top 50 places to surf in the world in 2013, described as a short and intense ride that creates amazing waves for surfing. The name means \u201cWall of Heads\u201d and can be dangerous. Because the location of the Games\u2019 competition has long been on the worldwide surfing circuit, it\u2019s long had a wooden tower that is built for competitions in the lagoon off the coast. It\u2019s this judging tower \u2013 and the determination that it wasn\u2019t going to be compliant with the safety expectations of Olympic competition, notably refereeing and broadcast coverage \u2013 that has set off a controversy in Tahiti and surfing circles. Olympic organizers have instead built an aluminum tower in the lagoon that has become a source of scrutiny throughout the build-up to the Olympics. After initially announcing plans to build a 14-ton, 150-square-meter tower with room for 40 people, drinking water and wastewater connections, the Paris 2024 team announced last year that it would be scaling back the project following backlash. \u201cAs the current judges\u2019 tower does not meet current safety standards, it will no longer be used and must be replaced if Teahupo\u2019o is to continue to organise surfing events, whether for the Olympic Games or any other competition,\u201d organizers said in a November news release. \u201cThe second issue is that the tower must be able to guarantee good conditions for the refereeing of the competition, in particular by offering the judges the necessary visibility over the entire wave.\u201d The plans for the new aluminum tower were criticized for potentially causing damage to the delicate coral reef off Teahupo\u2019o at a time when global warming is already harming coral reefs around the world. Video posted last year by Save Teahupo\u2019o Reef showed a barge \u2013 being used to build the tower \u2013 stuck on the reef, as well as evidence of broken coral The tower had been ripped by some critics as a symbol of colonialism and accused the organizers of the event of not living up to their claims that the competition would be sustainable and environmentally friendly. Alexandra Dempsey, coral reef ecologist and CEO of Khaled bin Sultan Living Oceans Foundation, said that the coral formation that makes Tahiti such an ideal place for professional surfing could be damaged by the tower. \u201cThe local communities there are incredibly passionate and culturally tied to the ocean, and particularly the reef systems and the reef systems there that caused the wave action in that area. And the perfect wave \u2026 is \u2026 a natural effect of how the reef is and has been naturally formed for millions of years,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cYou\u2019re really not only damaging the ecology of the reef, but also the structure that\u2019s been there, that\u2019s been able to create the wonderful waves that that site was chosen for. And we\u2019re not really sure what the outcomes or the fallout would be of damaging the reef system there,\u201d she added. There are over 1,000 species of fish and 150 species of coral in French Polynesia, according to Tahiti\u2019s tourism board. Threatened by the effects of climate change and mass tourism, the corals are a highly protected species. The Paris 2024 committee said in a November news release that other options had been considered \u2013 such as reinforcing the foundations of the current tower, certifying the existing tower and existing foundation as safe, building a new wooden tower and having the judges judge the competition either from the shore or from boat. All of those options were ruled out and the decision was made to construct a slimmed-down version of the new aluminum tower. \u201cThe protection of the natural environment at Teahupo\u2019o has always been a priority in the conception of all envisaged solutions for the site,\u201d the news release stated. \u201cAll development plans at Teahupo\u2019o have been studied to minimise impact on the environment. This has been the aim of all the studies carried out with a view of organising the Games, and in particular the environmental support mission during the design and construction phase of the new tower.\u201d \u201cThe new tower, less imposing and reduced in size and weight, installed on new permanent foundations, is the solution that will ensure the longevity of the tower and guarantee that future sporting events can be held at Teahupo\u2019o,\u201d organizers added. \u201cThis tower and the new foundations will be able to receive 10-year certification, which is essential for insurance purposes.\u201d The decision met with outrage from activists and condemnation from the International Surfing Association, the sport\u2019s world governing body. The new nine-ton, 50-square-meter, three-story tower is now sitting in the waters off Teahupo\u2019o and \u2013 as Surfer Magazine reported in April \u2013 is in an area that does not directly affect much of the coral, though the long-term effects have yet to be seen. \u201cThe area where the tower is built has very little coral. It\u2019s a flat shelf with small spread out corals heads and a few bigger rocks covered with coral,\u201d wrote Tim McKenna, a Tahiti-based photographer, in an Instagram post that showed photos of how the new tower looks after its construction. \u201cOver the years corals (have) even covered the previous concrete tower base structure.\u201d He added: \u201cThe new tower was never only for the Olympic Games. It\u2019s a collapsable tower that will be assembled every year for the duration of the event. \u201cThe aluminum structure designed and built exclusively in Tahiti can finally be certified for insurance and safety reasons. It\u2019s an investment the Tahitian government has made for the \u2026 next 20 years of surfing events at Teahupo\u2019o.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/sport/tahiti-summer-olympics-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "sports"}}

{"id": "2024_07_04_sport_china-doping-swimming-olympics", "text": "Swimming\u2019s international governing body says\u00a0its executive director Brent Nowicki has been ordered to testify in a US criminal investigation into a case involving 23 Chinese swimmers who failed doping tests in 2021 but were allowed to continue competing and won medals in the Tokyo Olympics. In a statement sent to CNN on Friday, World Aquatics said Nowicki was served with a subpoena and is \u201cworking to schedule a meeting with the government, which, in all likelihood will obviate the need for testimony before a Grand Jury.\u201d The Chinese swimmers tested positive for trimetazidine, a banned performance-enhancing substance, several months before the 2021 Tokyo Olympics,\u00a0according to a report\u00a0from The New York Times released in April in coordination with German public broadcaster ARD. Eleven of the 23 Chinese swimmers are set to compete in the 2024 Paris Olympics. China\u2019s anti-doping agency has said the 23 athletes tested positive for an \u201cextremely low concentration\u201d of trimetazidine at a national swimming competition in 2021. Trimetazidine has the potential to boost endurance and has been banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) since 2014. But the agency decided the swimmers were not responsible for the results because they were inadvertently exposed to the drug. In May, the US House select committee on China asked the FBI and the Justice Department to launch an investigation into the case under a 2020 law that allows for the criminal prosecution of people who help athletes dope at international competitions, even if they didn\u2019t happen in the United States. \u201cWe can\u2019t comment on the reported federal law enforcement investigation,\u201d Travis Tygart, the CEO of the US Anti-Doping Agency, said in a statement to CNN Thursday. \u201cThe Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act was enacted in 2021 with broad athlete, sport, and multinational governmental support because WADA could not be trusted to be a strong, fair global watchdog to protect clean athletes and fair sport,\u201d Tygart said. In his statement, Tygart, who has blamed WADA and China\u2019s doping watchdog (CHINADA) for covering up the positive tests, implied that WADA officials were afraid to travel to the US out of concern they would face questions from law enforcement. In a news conference earlier this year, WADA President Witold Ba\u0144ka said the agency \u201cfollowed all due processes and diligently investigated every lead and line of enquiry in this matter\u201d and found \u201cno evidence of wrongdoing \u2026 and no credible way to disprove the contamination theory that was accepted by CHINADA.\u201d WADA was notified of the positive tests in June 2021, roughly a month before the Tokyo Games kicked off.

{"id": "2024_07_06_sport_esports-world-cup-saudi-arabia-spt-intl", "text": "In the heart of Saudi Arabia\u2019s capital, a seismic moment for esports is underway; one which has triggered both excitement and concern across the industry. The Esports World Cup (EWC) \u2013 which began on July 3 \u2013 has brought together professional gamers, publishers and fans from across the world for an eight-week competitive gaming bonanza. Its record-breaking prize pool of more than $60 million has raised eyebrows and Ralf Reichert, CEO of the Esports World Cup Foundation which is organizing the event, told CNN Sport that the spectacle will help unite the industry. \u201cThe question was: what is missing in the sports landscape? To bring this on the similar scale as the largest traditional sports events and something that brings together the whole industry,\u201d Reichert said. \u201cThere\u2019s a fantastic landscape of amazing tournaments, leagues, clubs, all of that stuff exists [in esports]. But what is the one thing that brings it all together? \u201cThat was the guiding principle when we thought about [the EWC], designed it and then announced it.\u201d But while the tournament will be a shot of adrenaline for esports, its launch has refreshed existing concerns about the industry\u2019s relationship with Saudi Arabia. How can the EWC help the industry? The EWC is Saudi Arabia\u2019s latest foray into esports, coming after the Gamers8 event last year, which boasted a $45 million prize purse. This year\u2019s tournament will involve some of the world\u2019s top organizations \u2013 such as T1, FlyQuest, Gen.G Esports, Fnatic and G2 Esports \u2013 competing against each other across 21 esports titles. The best performing club across the various titles will be crowned the ultimate EWC champion. The eye-watering prize purse which will be broken down into different categories, such as player bounties and prizes for overall performance. The EWC also comes after a difficult period for an industry which has seen large-scale layoffs. At the start of the year, game developer and publisher Riot Games letting 11% of its workforce go. According to the New York Times, esports leagues are struggling to make money, while sponsors have slashed their advertising budgets and many teams are now operating at a loss. But the EWC is now providing an opportunity for over 20 major brands \u2013 such as Adidas and KitKat \u2013 to forge fresh and lucrative partnerships with esports teams across the tournament. In June, Warner Bros. Discovery \u2013 CNN\u2019s parent company \u2013 and the Esports World Cup Foundation agreed to a new partnership which includes Eurosport, CNN and other WBD platforms. However, Reichert says the EWC was not created to help boost an ailing industry and that, no matter the state of the esports community, a tournament such as the EWC was pivotal in allowing organizations to flourish. \u201cSo even without the overall economic downturn, we would have done the same thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe fundamentally believe that this competition will unite the industry and heavily put [clubs] in the middle of it.\u201d Through the Esports World Cup Foundation, Reichert is excited about the launch of the EWC Club Program. The initiative will bid to \u201cpromote sustainable planning\u201d by offering 28 clubs worldwide an \u201cannual six-figure payout.\u201d The hope is that it will offer organizations a platform in which to grow and maximize their participation in the annual tournament. Sam Mathews, founder and CEO of esports giant Fnatic, says the program will afford the organization the opportunity to branch out into different game titles \u2013 such as Street Fighter \u2013 which in turn will help the overall esports community. \u201cA lot of that money is going to go into new regions, new games, new audiences, new players. It\u2019s actually going into the ecosystem itself,\u201d he told CNN Sport. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting to go into new games and compete with other teams.\u201d Industry concern While the EWC promises to bring of excitement and stability to the industry, it\u2019s also proved a divisive topic. Many are concerned by the tournament\u2019s links to Saudi Arabia, which has been accused of \u201csportswashing\u201d \u2013 a concept that involves nations using high-profile sporting events to project a favorable image of their country around the world, often to draw attention away from alleged wrongdoing. Reichert says the EWC Foundation, which officially runs the event, is a non-profit organization but says its been part-funded by the Saudi government \u2013 in the same way a host nation would invest in any major sporting event, he adds. Part of its funding also comes from sponsors. However, Reichert also says there are no plans to move the EWC away from Saudi Arabia in the near future. \u201cIt\u2019s a country which is investing in [esports] on a scale that no one else is at this point in time and that is fantastic for the sport,\u201d he added. \u201cEverything we ever dreamt of, to be honest. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t rule out that it ever goes out of Saudi Arabia, but for the foreseeable future, definitely the plan is to stay there and to build it as a hub.\u201d Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who helped launch the EWC, previously said he doesn\u2019t \u201ccare\u201d about the country\u2019s investments being described as sportswashing. \u201cWell, if sportswashing is going to increase my GDP by one percent, then I will continue doing sportswashing,\u201d MBS said in an interview with Fox News which aired in 2023. The concern around the nation\u2019s human rights record \u2013 notably freedom of speech and treatment of minorities \u2013 has been widespread in esports, with some inside the industry refusing to take part in the EWC. With the Gulf nation looking to diversify its economy and move away from its heavy reliance on fossil fuels, it already has a large footprint in competitive gaming. The Saudi government-controlled Public Investment Fund (PIF) has in recent years bought some of the biggest companies in the industry, namely the Savvy Gaming Group (SGG). SGG has since acquired ESL, a leading organizer of esports events, and FACEIT, a top digital platform, as it continues its aim of making Saudi a hub for global gaming. According to esports insider and journalist Rod Breslau, Saudi\u2019s growing control over the entire industry is what is most problematic, not simply the creation of the EWC. \u201cIt\u2019s just the next thing, the next domino that\u2019ll go down,\u201d he told CNN Sport. \u201cIf this really was a privatized company that just got huge in Saudi Arabia for doing esports games, I wouldn\u2019t have as much of a problem with it. \u201cBut it is their government and this is the entire initiative. All of this is used to just change opinion.\u201d Human rights concerns Human rights organizations are also concerned about the Saudis\u2019 continued investment in esports. \u201cSaudi Arabia is investing billions in esports, a field thriving on online interactions, while cracking down on any form of critical online expression with harsh prison terms and even a death sentence,\u201d Dana Ahmed, Amnesty International\u2019s Middle East researcher, told CNN in a statement. \u201cWe must not forget the brave voices imprisoned and punished for their online expression, such as fitness instructor Manahel al-Otaibi, jailed for 11 years for her support of women\u2019s rights online. Esports participants and fans should look beyond the spectacle and be aware of the crackdown on online expression in Saudi Arabia.\u201d The concerns are mirrored by Nick McGeehan, co-director of FairSquare \u2013 a non-profit human rights organization. In a statement to CNN, he says investing in esports will allow Saudi Arabia to target a younger demographic with its narrative. \u201cWhat they don\u2019t want the world to see or talk about are the murders of journalists, the repression of women\u2019s rights activists, the life sentences for tweets expressing mild criticism of the authorities, or the grossly unfair trials and death sentences handed out to people who challenge the authoritarian rule of Mohamed bin Salman,\u201d he added. CNN has reached out to PIF for comment but is yet to receive a response. It is criticism which has put some esports organizations on the back foot, with fans expressing their disdain on social media. Team Liquid \u2013 a leading esports organization \u2013 released a lengthy video on social media explaining its reasons for participating in the tournament, while confirming it would support members of the team who did not feel comfortable with being involved. Team Liquid\u2019s co-CEO Steve Arhancet also wrote a message to fans on X, formerly known as Twitter, where he further explained the decision. \u201cI and fellow TL executives have had conversations with women and queer individuals in Saudi Arabia, and consulted domain experts at multiple NGOs such as Amnesty International and Out Leadership,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhile there is still much for me to learn, a recurring theme from these experiences has shaped my opinion: Progress lies in engagement, not isolation.\u201d He added: \u201cAs a gay man, I understand the pain of exclusion. However, as a US citizen, I know my struggles pale compared to what LGBT Saudis face daily,\u201d he said, adding he wants to use the EWC to keep talking about the issues. According to Breslau, Team Liquid\u2019s players are permitted to and will wear Pride jerseys while competing at the tournament. Mathews is aware of those who feel let down by the decision for Fnatic to compete at the EWC this year, but said he has seen enough \u201cpositive sentiment\u201d from Saudi Arabia to see that it\u2019s moving in the right direction. \u201cUltimately, sport is unifying and it\u2019s entertainment. We need a world where we have more unification than division, right?\u201d he said. \u201cWe need a world where we have entertainment when there\u2019s a lot of anger and division. \u201cFrom my experience, there are a lot of people in [Saudi Arabia] that love their games, right to the top. So I don\u2019t think this is artificial. They do love esports and gaming.\u201d It\u2019s a narrative which is shared by Reichert, who says he is heavily engaged with the debate surrounding the issues in Saudi Arabia. \u201cThere is a certain view across the world in different countries about Saudi Arabia, and some of it is true and some \u2013 and a lot of it \u2013 is not true,\u201d he said, when asked to respond to criticism of the EWC. \u201cIt\u2019s probably unprecedented how quickly Saudi Arabia is moving ahead in its progression. And its intentions to grow and open up is actually what\u2019s happening on site, and everything else time will tell.\u201d While it\u2019s yet to be seen how successful this year\u2019s EWC will be, it appears the tournament and Saudi\u2019s involvement in the industry is set to grow. Those opposed to the nation\u2019s involvement are left in a tough position, with the community far from finding a common consensus.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/sport/esports-world-cup-saudi-arabia-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Fresh off being named a WNBA All-Star, Reese impressed with 27 points, 10 rebounds and two blocks to help the Sky win their second game on the bounce against a Storm squad which had been on a four-game winning streak and 8-1 at home until Friday night. The former LSU star\u2019s 12th consecutive double double matches the all-time record set by all-time WNBA great Candace Parker, who achieved the feat across the 2009 and 2010 seasons. \u201cI don\u2019t really think about it.

Reese and guard Chennedy Carter, who led all scorers on the night with a season-high 33 points, combined for over 68% of Chicago\u2019s point tally in the victory against a balanced Seattle attack which featured all five Storm starters hitting the double figure mark. The game was tight throughout the first half with Chicago holding a one-point lead after the first quarter and Seattle fighting back to take a narrow two-point advantage into the break. The Sky broke the game open in the third behind Carter, who scored 11 in the period, to go up six heading into the fourth. Chicago held back the persistent Storm behind a resilient Reese, who hit four clutch free throws in the final 20 seconds of the game to seal the win. Asked about the loud and pressure-filled atmosphere in Seattle and the free throws down the stretch, Reese said, \u201cI haven\u2019t always been great at free throws. It\u2019s been obviously a work in progress for me and just continuing to just get better and be able to have teammates and coaches that trust in me.\u201d \u201cJust being able to step up there with confidence every single day in practice shoot 50 free throws at the end, so I\u2019m always focused for that, so that moment, it was like nothing for me.\u201d Chicago and Seattle play again in Washington on Sunday afternoon.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/sport/angel-reese-chicago-sky-seattle-storm-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "sports"}}

In its statement, UEFA said its appeals body charged the defender \u201cfor failing to comply with the general principles of conduct, for violating the basic rules of decent conduct, for using sports events for manifestations of a non-sporting nature and for bringing the sport of football into disrepute.\u201d The Turkish Football Federation confirmed to CNN that its legal department is working on an appeal to the suspension. \u201cDoes anyone say that the Germans have an eagle on their jerseys? Does anyone say that the French have a rooster on their jerseys?\u201d Turkey\u2019s president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan said to Turkish broadcaster TRT. \u201cThere, Merih expressed his excitement with this image. Thereupon, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs called their officials and the necessary steps are being taken accordingly. \u201cHopefully, on Saturday we will leave the field with a victory and move on to the next round. Unless something extraordinary happens, we have decided to go to the match.\u201d CNN\u2019s German affiliate network NTV and TRT reported that Erdogan is set to come to Berlin on Saturday for Turkey\u2019s game against the Netherlands. Servet Yardimci, UEFA Executive Board Member and Turkish Football Federation (TFF) Presidential Candidate, called the ban \u201cunacceptable.\u201d \u201cRequesting punishment for a natural celebration after the match is over in a tournament that is running smoothly is an intervention in the independence of football,\u201d he wrote in a statement on X, formerly known as Twitter. \u201cOur football player shared a natural joy when he was celebrating with Turkish fans the happiness of a moment \u2026 there is no element here that could hurt your opponent or any community. The player naturally expressed his feelings at the press conference he attended after the match. \u201cFootball players\u2019 celebration methods and manners should not be penalized unless they are derogatory to any group or group or violate basic rules of courtesy.\u201d Yardimci added: \u201cI would like to emphasize my belief that this mistake must be corrected before it is too late.\u201d The Turkish minister of youth and sports, Osman A\u015fk\u0131n Bak, said on X: \u201cWe condemn UEFA\u2019s unfair and biased decision, which we believe has no legal basis and is entirely political. \u201cWe will continue to seek our rights through legal means against this double standard applied to our country and our national football player Merih Demiral. \u201cWe believe in our football players. They will also give the necessary answer on the green field!\u201d Following the win against Austria, Demiral posted a picture of himself making the gesture on X. \u201cHappy is one who calls themselves a Turk,\u201d the defender captioned the post. \u201cI had a certain specific celebration in mind. That\u2019s what I did. It has to do with the Turkish identity because I\u2019m very proud to be a Turk. And I felt that to the fullest after the second goal, so I ended up doing that gesture,\u201d Demiral told reporters after the game. \u201cI\u2019m very happy that I did that.\u201d Germany summoned Turkey\u2019s ambassador in Berlin Thursday in a tit for tat over the celebration after Turkey recalled the German ambassador in Ankara. German representatives discussed the incident with the Turkish ambassador in Berlin, the German foreign ministry added. Germany\u2019s Interior Minister, Nancy Faeser, warned Wednesday \u201cthe symbols of Turkish right-wing extremists have no place in our stadiums\u201d and said that \u201cusing the European football championships as a platform for racism is completely unacceptable.\u201d Faeser added that the \u201cGrey Wolves\u201d group is under surveillance in Germany.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/sport/uefa-bans-turkey-defender-merih-demiral-celebration-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "sports"}}

The two-time WNBA MVP scored 28 points in the 104-85 victory to bring her Aces total to 4,301 points, taking her past Sophia Young-Malcolm\u2019s previous record of 4,300. Wilson also had 10 rebounds to earn her 11th double-double of the season in the milestone game at the Michelob Ultra Arena. Wilson, who was drafted by Las Vegas first overall in 2018, knocked down two free throws late in the fourth quarter to break the record. \u201cIt means the world, it really does,\u201d Wilson told the ESPN broadcast after the game. \u201cIt\u2019s a special moment. I didn\u2019t even know, honestly, until about the third quarter. Sydney [Colson] actually told me, she was like, \u2018Come on, this is your chance, you don\u2019t want to do it away, you want to do it at home.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018That is right.\u2019 \u201cSo I\u2019m so grateful to have this moment, my teammates sharing it with me, this crowd sharing it with me. But the job\u2019s not done. we still got a lot more we gotta learn and grow from, but I\u2019m definitely gonna take in this moment.\u201d Young-Malcolm scored all of her points between 2006 and 2015, while the organization was still operating under the San Antonio (Silver) Stars moniker, before its 2017 relocation to Las Vegas. The team was one of the eight original WNBA teams that joined the league\u2019s inaugural 1997 season and played in Salt Lake City as the Utah Starzz until 2002. The Aces brought stars from the franchise\u2019s history, including Young-Malcom, on to the court postgame to celebrate Wilson\u2019s achievement. \u201cIt\u2019s all about growing the game,\u201d said Wilson. \u201cThey laid the foundations down for us to be able to wear this uniform today. Even though it\u2019s maybe a different color, a different city, they are the foundations so to do this in front of them, it truly is something special.\u201d Wilson is having a dominant season, averaging a league-leading 27 points per game and is in contention to win her third MVP award. She is also looking to complete a historic three-peat with Las Vegas, having won the WNBA championship in both 2022 and 2023. The lopsided win moves the Aces to 13-7 on the season. Kelsey Plum scored 23 points to help power Vegas to victory, while fellow All-Stars Jackie Young and Chelsea Gray added 18 and 12 points respectively. Odyssey Sims dropped a season-high 25 points for the Wings, who fall to 5-17 and are tied for the worst record in the league with the Washington Mystics.

The game was 0-0 after 90 minutes and, with no extra time in this tournament, it headed straight to the dreaded penalty kicks where Uruguay held its cool to beat Brazil 4-2 in the shootout. While there were no goals in the game, there was a total of 41 fouls in the fiercely contested matchup with four yellow cards and then a red card shown to Uruguay\u2019s Nahitan N\u00e1ndez. N\u00e1ndez was sent off as the game neared its conclusion following a foul on Rodrygo. The Uruguay player caught Brazil\u2019s tricky winger with a studs up tackle on the ankle and was dismissed following a VAR check. With 10 men, Uruguay held on to take the game the distance and penalties loomed. Uruguay instantly seized the initiative in the shootout as Federico Valverde dispatched La Celeste\u2019s first penalty \u2013 followed by \u00c9der Milit\u00e3o failing to net Brazil\u2019s first spot kick as it was saved by goalkeeper Sergio Rochet. Aston Villa\u2019s Douglas Luiz then hit the post with Brazil\u2019s third penalty kick and Uruguay was firmly in the driving seat and leading 3-1. Despite Brazil \u2018keeper Alisson Becker giving fans hope when he saved Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez\u2019s penalty, it was too little, too late as Uruguay\u2019s Manuel Ugarte calmly sent Alisson the wrong way to seal his team\u2019s spot in the final four. \u201cIt was a very tense match, against a very tough opponent, suffering in the last minutes a man down.

That\u2019s the odds of making two holes-in-one in a single round, according to the National Hole-In-One Registry. On Friday, Frank Bensel Jr. made two in a row. While some of the game\u2019s most talented players wait years \u2013 even entire careers \u2013 for an ace, the 56-year-old went back-to-back in a remarkable few minutes at the second round of the US Senior Open. The Jupiter, Florida-native tore through the par-three fourth and fifth holes of Rhode Island\u2019s Newport Country Club in just two swings, going 184 yards from tee to cup before acing again from 203 yards mere minutes later. Four consecutive bogeys immediately afterwards may have undone the Floridian\u2019s tournament progress, lifting him to one-over par for the round and six-over overall, but his near-miraculous efforts enter him into a league of his own. No golfer has ever made back-to-back aces in any Tour-sanctioned event on record, according to the PGA Tour Champions: a professional tour for golfers aged 50 and over which is hosting the third of five major championships this week. Ireland\u2019s Seamus Power made consecutive holes-in-one at Augusta National last year, but did so during the pre-tournament Par Three contest as opposed to the Masters itself. A hole-in-one is made just once every 3,500 rounds across more than 500 million rounds played in the United States each year, according to data compiled by the National Hole-In-One Registry, which has logged more than 108,000 \u201cvalid\u201d aces since 2006. An \u201caverage\u201d player has a 12,000 to one chance of making an ace, four times less likely than the odds of a Tour player holing one, the registry states. \u201cTruly historic,\u201d tournament organizer the United States Golf Association (USGA) wrote in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, sharing Bensel Jr.\u2019s scorecard. Bensel Jr. has played six events on the PGA Tour since 1998, most recently at the 2021 PGA Championship, though is yet to make the cut. His appearance at the US Senior Open marks his third on the PGA Tour Champions and the first since a 77th place finish at the Senior PGA Championship in 2021. Sunday\u2019s victor will claim an $800,000 cut of a $4 million prize purse, with Bernhard Langer seeking to defend his crown. Last year\u2019s victory \u2013 Langer\u2019s 46th on the PGA Tour Champions and 12th senior major \u2013 saw the two-time Masters winner become the most successful golfer in the circuit\u2019s history.

{"id": "2024_07_06_sport_canada-venezuela-copa-america-spt-intl", "text": "Canada continued its surprising debut run at the Copa Am\u00e9rica, defeating Venezuela 4-3 in a penalty shootout to make the semifinals of the competition for the first time ever. As the teams stepped up to take their spot-kicks, the shootout ended 3-3 after five attempts each. With sweet victory or damaging defeat on the line with potentially one kick, Wilker \u00c1ngel had his attempt saved by Canada keeper Maxime Cr\u00e9peau on the sixth attempt and Isma\u00ebl Kon\u00e9 buried the winner to send an elated Canucks squad through. \u201cEmotions are running high, I\u2019m so happy for everyone who is supporting us,\u201d Cr\u00e9peau told Canada\u2019s TSN. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of work and now we have the fruit of our hard work. \u201cThis is amazing to be in the semifinals of Copa Am\u00e9rica. I think everybody needs to realize this country and its footballers deserve respect.\u201d Jacob Shaffelburg opened the scoring on the night for Canada in the 13th minute, brilliantly finishing off a pass at the near post from forward Jonathan David, who stormed towards goal on the right past Venezuela defender Yordan Osorio off a throw-in. The goal sent the Canada squad wild with head coach Jesse Marsch pumping his fists into the air multiple times before being mobbed by the bench, while Shaffelburg held aloft a No. 17 shirt bearing the name of teammate Tajon Buchanan, who broke his tibia in training earlier in the week. Sensing the opportunity at hand presented by a quarterfinal, both teams continued to push throughout the first half with chances aplenty for both the Vinotinto and the Canadians. However, it was the North American side which enjoyed the best opportunities. First, in the 26th minute, Alphonso Davies began a counterattack with a brilliant through-ball to Shaffelburg who set up David in the middle of the pitch, but the Lille forward sent his shot wide with only the keeper to beat. Then in the 31st, a loose ball in the area fell to Richie Laryea, whose pass across the goal somehow eluded an unmarked Cyle Larin on the far post. Canada was made to rue those spurned opportunities as Venezuela\u2019s all-time leading scorer Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n scored the equalizer in amazing fashion. Defender Jon Aramburu cleared a Canada throw in to the middle of the pitch and Rond\u00f3n muscled his way to the ball first and then lofted a shot from over 40 yards after seeing Cr\u00e9peau off his line. The resultant wondergoal, which sparked jubilant scenes from the Venezuela faithful, was a just reward for the team\u2019s efforts and the great contest for those in attendance. Despite Canada\u2019s best efforts to earn the winner in regulation \u2013 the Copa Am\u00e9rica features no extra-time with shootouts after 90 minutes until the final \u2013 the match ended with dreaded penalties and a deflated Venezuela. What awaits now for Canada is a match-up with Lionel Messi and defending champion Argentina in the semifinals \u2013 a rematch of the opening game of this edition of the Copa Am\u00e9rica, which La Albiceleste won 2-0 \u2013 on Tuesday night in New Jersey.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/sport/canada-venezuela-copa-america-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_sport_paris-olympics-seine-triathlon-bacteria-intl", "text": "A reference point for Parisians and tourists alike, the River Seine will be the crown jewel of the Olympics this summer, staging events such as the triathlon as well as the opening ceremony, which for the first time in Olympic history will not be taking place in a stadium. Starting at Pont Alexandre III Bridge, the individual triathlon races are set to begin with a 1.5-kilometer swim, followed by a 40K bike race \u2013 passing by the Le Grand Palais and Champs-Elys\u00e9es \u2013 before finishing with a 10K run through the heart of the city. A mixed team relay race involving four athletes \u2013 two men and two women \u2013 will also start at Pont Alexandre III Bridge with each team member completing a 300-meter swim, followed by a 5.8K bike ride and 1.8K run. If all goes to plan, it will be a historic moment, given that swimming in the Seine has been illegal for more than 100 years due to the river\u2019s pollution levels, though some swimming has been permitted recently as part of triathlon test events. But some are warning that there are still potential dangers lurking below the river\u2019s shimmery surface. Recent testing results shared with CNN by technology company Fluidion show that the Seine is still not safe for swimming as per the standards set by World Triathlon, due to high E. Coli bacteria levels in the water, potentially exposing athletes to serious health risks. Authorities have spent at least \u20ac1.4 billion ($1.55 billion) to clean up the Seine. Last month, a rainwater storage facility was opened that can hold 20 Olympic swimming pools worth of water to reduce pressure on the sewage network and lower the risk of wastewater being discharged into the Seine, according to a statement from Paris 2024. Meanwhile, triathlon teams around the world are preparing for the worst and hoping for the best. \u201cFor me, it will be very frustrating and very shaming for France, Paris and the Olympics if we can\u2019t do a triathlon,\u201d French-born triathlete Jeanne Lehair told CNN in a telephone interview. What does the latest testing show? The city of Paris is working with its own laboratory to monitor the Olympic Seine site, but technology company Fluidion, founded in Paris in 2012, has also been checking the water quality of the river several times a week at Pont Alexandre III Bridge. The Seine serves as Fluidion\u2019s primary research site, according to the company, hence why they routinely collect water samples for internal research efforts. CNN has not independently verified the organization\u2019s findings. Fluidion\u2019s testing has found that, on average, E. Coli levels in the Siene between early April\u00a0and late May were just under 3400 MPN/100mL. According to CNN\u2019s calculation, this is more than three times higher than the level needed for \u201cgood\u201d water quality, as per World Triathlon standards. \u201cWe have experienced a very rainy past couple of months, causing numerous combined sewer overflows in Paris and upstream,\u201d Dan Angelescu, CEO of Fluidion, told CNN on May 31 via email, adding that the impact on water quality is evident, with \u201cnoticeable bacterial spikes following storm events.\u201d Nearly all of France has seen 120 to 200% of normal rainfall over the past three months, with numerous episodes of flooding across portions of the country, especially the north, according to M\u00e9t\u00e9o France. The highest E. Coli levels recorded by Fluidion were 23590 MPN/100mL on May 2 and 13090 MPN/100mL on May 30, according to Angelescu. The May 2 result is more than 20 times higher than World Triathlon\u2019s \u201cgood quality\u201d level, according to CNN\u2019s calculation. More recently, following several days of dry and sunny weather, E. Coli levels on Monday 6 June were 2280 MPN/100mL, according to Angelescu, better than previous results but still above acceptable levels for swimming. If E. Coli levels remain this high, the swimming leg of the triathlon will have to be cancelled, according to World Triathlon competition rules, unless the organization\u2019s medical committee decides that the race can go ahead. Does Paris 2024 have a plan B? Earlier in June, World Triathlon told CNN in an email that the first contingency plan would be to delay the race by one day. But if poor water quality persisted, the triathlon would have to be downgraded to a duathlon with no swimming, the organization confirmed. Angelescu said that while E. Coli is not typically pathogenic itself, it can indicate the presence of other pathogens, which can cause skin rashes, diarrhea, serious gastrointestinal diseases and, in very rare cases, even death. However, Angelescu said that the water quality of the Seine is likely to improve significantly before July due to drier and sunnier summer conditions, which will reduce the frequency of sewage spills. \u201cIt is highly speculative and scientifically unsound to project any conclusions about water quality during the Games based on recent trends,\u201d he said. Angelescu said that \u201csignificant infrastructure projects\u201d by the city of Paris designed to improve water quality will have a \u201csubstantial\u201d impact. \u201cThese tanks are expected to become operational before the Games, potentially becoming a \u2026 Games changer,\u201d added Angelescu. \u201cWhen our instruments and data indicate that the water quality is good, we will be the first to dive in, headfirst!\u201d Angelescu\u2019s tone of optimism isn\u2019t universally shared. French charity Surfrider Foundation Europe warned in April that they were \u201cgenuinely concerned about the health of athletes\u201d after only one of the 14 samples collected by the organization indicated a satisfactory standard of water quality for swimming. Two months later, the charity told CNN that they have since taken five additional samples, with E. coli levels remaining \u201csystematically above the guide values.\u201d CNN has not independently verified the charity\u2019s findings. How has Paris 2024 responded to these findings? Paris 2024 said they still have \u201cgreat confidence\u201d in the city of Paris to improve water quality to the \u201cnecessary standard\u201d in time for the Games. \u201cGenerally, water quality in the Seine continues to improve every day,\u201d they said in a statement to CNN in early June. \u201cBy the time of the Games, bacteriological pollution in the Seine will have been reduced by 75% thanks to the range of actions undertaken by our partners.\u201d In a statement to CNN, the city of Paris said that recent grey and rainy conditions have had a \u201cmajor impact\u201d on the Seine\u2019s water quality. A lack of sunlight \u2013 which would normally help to kill bacteria \u2013 has also contributed to the poor quality, they said earlier this month. They added: \u201cIt is only when summer conditions (strong sunshine, high temperatures, prolonged absence of rain) become established that the Seine will gradually return to its \u2018summer\u2019 appearance, and that we will see a gradual and significant improvement in water quality.\u201d Following multiple days of sunny weather in the first week of June,\u00a0E. Coli\u00a0levels improved near Pont Alexandre III Bridge, according to official data from the city of Paris shared with CNN, but whether the good weather will last remains to be seen. No precipitation trend, higher or lower than average, has been\u00a0predicted\u00a0for areas around Paris for the summer. Since June 1,\u00a0E. Coli\u00a0levels declined from around 7000 UFC/100mL (equivalent units to MPN/100mL, according to World Triathlon) to just below 1000 UFC/100mL on June 9, according to official data. However, World Triathlon\u2019s\u00a0Competition Rules\u00a02024 say that these levels are still too high for swimming, unless the organization\u2019s medical committee decides that the race can go ahead. Disinfectant and probiotics The threat that E. Coli and other bacteria pose is nothing new to triathlon teams. Over the last decade, water quality issues have been increasingly encountered, according to Mike Cavendish, Director of Performance at British Triathlon, who outlined preventative measures British athletes will be taking to ensure their health during Paris 2024. \u201cDisinfectant sounds like a really basic thing but it\u2019s something we will be doing a lot of, making sure that athletes are clean, that their equipment is clean,\u201d Cavendish told CNN in a telephone interview. Probiotic yogurts can also help to improve gut health, Cavenish added. Phil Dunne, Triathlon Canada\u2019s High Performance Director, said in a statement to CNN that their athletes are being supported by \u201ca team of physicians and dietitians\u201d to reduce the risk of becoming sick due to \u201ccompromised\u201d water quality. Tim Harradine, CEO of AusTriathlon, said that triathletes are used to dealing with the \u201cchanging nature\u201d of waterways. \u201cSometimes they race in the rain, sometimes they race in the heat,\u201d Harradine told CNN in a telephone interview, adding that athlete health will always come first. Lehair, who recently changed her nationality in time to represent Luxembourg at Paris 2024, told CNN that she understands why precautions need to be taken, but didn\u2019t seem altogether convinced by the effectiveness of measures like probiotics. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be good for the body anyway, so maybe you can have a try but it\u2019s not 100% sure that you won\u2019t get sick if you take probiotics,\u201d she said. \u201cAt least maybe you are stressing a bit less on the day of the race.\u201d \u2018Better quality of water is good for everyone\u2019 Paris 2024 isn\u2019t the first sporting event to contend with water quality issues. In March, concerns were raised after E. coli bacteria was discovered in London\u2019s River Thames ahead of the historic Oxford and Cambridge boat race. Also, in 2016, drug-resistant superbugs from hospital sewage were found in Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Guanabara Bay. Lehair is pleased that the authorities are attempting to clean up the river, but just wishes it had happened sooner. \u201cThey should have done this much before, just for the quality of the water in general and for the people, for the city,\u201d she said. \u201cBetter quality of water is good for everyone.\u201d Cavendish said that if the authorities\u2019 clean-up efforts in Paris prove successful, other countries could be encouraged to follow suit. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIf they pull this off and it looks fantastic, and they get a swim for the Olympics and the Paralympics \u2026 it puts pressure on other governments around the world, including our own, to try and make sure that we get safe swimming,\u201d said Cavendish. Harradine echoed that sentiment: \u201cIt\u2019s a very visible race venue and what a great legacy it could leave if this works well for the city.\u201d And if the worst comes to the worst and the impact of rain on water quality does threaten the triathlon races Cavendish is confident that the right call will be made. \u201cThe eyes of the world are on this race so I think you can guarantee that they (Paris 2024 and World Triathlon) will be putting all the right people in the room to make the right decision,\u201d he said.

Jackson was 24. Three vehicles were involved in the fatal crash\u00a0in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, state police said\u00a0in a statement. Jackson, a front-seat passenger in a Dodge Charger, and Isaiah Hazel, the driver of that vehicle. were pronounced dead at the scene, according to authorities. Anthony Lytton Jr., who was sitting in the rear seat, was pronounced dead at a hospital, state police said. Investigators believe the driver of a silver Infiniti \u201cattempted to change lanes while driving at a high rate of speed when she struck the Dodge Charger\u201d and then struck another vehicle, a Chevrolet Impala, according to the state police news release. \u201cThe\u00a0Charger subsequently traveled off of the right side of the roadway and struck multiple tree stumps where the vehicle came to rest,\u201d the statement said. Maryland State Police believe alcohol may have been a contributing factor. Charges are pending the investigation and consultation with the county state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office, police said. According to a post on X from the Henry A. Wise High School athletic department, Jackson, Hazel and Lytton were teammates at the school in Upper Marlboro for several seasons. Hazel played collegiately at Maryland and Charlotte, while Lytton was on teams at Florida State, Penn State and Bowie State.  \u201cWe are deeply saddened by the news of Khyree\u2019s passing,\u201d Vikings owners Mark and Zygi Wilf said\u00a0in a statement. \u201cKhyree had an extremely bright future ahead of him as a player, and it was clear he was dedicated to being a tremendous person who made a positive difference in people\u2019s lives.\u201d The Vikings\u00a0said they have been in contact with Jackson\u2019s\u00a0family, offering support and have informed Jackson\u2019s teammates, coaches and staff of the tragic situation. \u201cI am absolutely crushed by this news,\u201d Vikings head coach Kevin O\u2019Connell said in a statement. \u201cKhyree brought a contagious energy to our facility and our team. His confidence and engaging personality immediately drew his teammates to him. In our short time together, it was evident Khyree was going to develop into a tremendous professional football player, but what was more impressive was his desire to become the best person he could be for his family and those around him. \u201cI am at a loss for words.

In his first two collegiate seasons, Jackson played at the University of Alabama in 2021-22, appearing in 21 games with 14 total tackles.

{"id": "2023_09_20_sport_saudi-arabia-soccer-spl-bin-salman-intl-spt-cmd-dg", "text": "When Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal reportedly planned a $1.1 billion bid to sign French soccer superstar Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 \u2013 including $332 million to his club, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), and an eye-watering $775 million salary packet to the World Cup winner for just one year \u2013 it was slammed by critics as sportswashing. Mbapp\u00e9 might have said no to the offer in July, but a month later, Neymar Jr. said yes to Al-Hilal, as the Brazil star moved from PSG for a transfer fee of around $98.5 million (\u20ac90 million) plus add-ons, according to multiple reports. In a record-breaking transfer window, Saudi Pro League (SPL) clubs spent close to $1 billion, acquiring 94 overseas players from Europe\u2019s major leagues \u2013 France\u2019s Ligue 1, Spain\u2019s La Liga, Italy\u2019s Serie A, Germany\u2019s Bundesliga and the English Premier League \u2013 according to Deloitte. Despite the Arab nation\u2019s poor human rights record, Saudi Arabia\u2019s spending spree to turn its domestic soccer league into a star-studded, bona fide competition shows the seriousness of its ambition. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman says he doesn\u2019t \u201ccare\u201d about the country\u2019s investment in sport being described as sportswashing. \u201cWell if sportswashing is going to increase my GDP by one percent, then I will continue doing sportswashing,\u201d MBS said in an\u00a0interview\u00a0with Fox News which aired Wednesday. Pressed on if he was bothered by the use of the term, MBS continued: \u201cI don\u2019t care. I have one percent GDP growth from sport, and I am aiming for another one and a half percent. Call it whatever you want, we\u2019re going to get that one and a half percent.\u201d Saudi clubs, several of which have been taken over by the nation\u2019s sovereign Public Investment Fund (PIF), have already attracted some of the biggest names in the sport. By attracting some of the world\u2019s biggest stars to the Gulf states, the SPL wants \u201cto drive competitiveness on and off the pitch,\u201d though it\u2019s keen to emphasize that these overseas players will help develop \u201cyoung Saudi talent.\u201d During this summer transfer window, the government-controlled PIF increased the cumulative value of these four clubs nearly five times, making them the most valuable in the country, according to estimates by the sports website Transfermarkt. Plenty of other leading stars have eagerly said yes to the SPL, notably 2022 Ballon D\u2019Or winner Karim Benzema joining Al-Ittihad at the end of his contract with Spanish soccer giant Real Madrid. As the European transfer window came to a close, the four PIF-owned teams have spent nearly $900 million (\u20ac835.1 million) on buying elite international players, Transfermarkt data shows, which ranked them in the top 20 clubs in the world by transfer expenditure, alongside soccer giants from England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy. Al Hilal alone paid more than $378 million (\u20ac353 million), more than PSG and Arsenal, making it the second-largest spender this year. The newly acquired players join five-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, who has a two-year contract with Al-Nassr where he will earn a staggering estimated $200 million a year, according to Saudi state-owned media, currently making him the world\u2019s highest paid soccer player. As of today, 21 of the most expensive soccer players in Saudi Arabia by transfer fees \u2013 all international stars \u2013 play for one of the PIF-owned clubs. Despite the financial outlay, the SPL is remaining deliberately tight-lipped about the specifics of its financial gamble, with chief operating officer Carlo Nohra confirming to CNN Sport that it was \u201cnot in [the SPL\u2019s] competitive advantage\u201d to report the salaries offered to players and coaches. The PIF has $777 billion in assets under management, according to its most recent filing, with ambitions to top $1 trillion within a few years. In 2021, it acquired English soccer club Newcastle United, before focusing on investments at home. The club is now also among top spenders on players. Saudi clubs not owned by the PIF are also splurging on big-ticket players, with former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson, 33, offered an eye-watering salary of $870,000 (\u00a3700,000) per week, according to multiple reports, in an estimated $15 million (\u00a312 million) transfer from Liverpool to Saudi team Al-Ettifaq. In a recent interview with The Athletic, Henderson said those numbers \u201cjust aren\u2019t true.\u201d \u201cEssentially, the signal is \u2018We mean business,\u2019\u201d Simon Chadwick, a professor of sport and geopolitical economy at SKEMA Business School, told CNN.\u201cWe\u2019ve got so much money that for a player who is \u2026 coming towards the end of his career, we can afford to pay him 700,000 [GB pounds a week], or whatever it is that he\u2019s being paid, and still have Cristiano Ronaldo and still be in the market for other players as well,\u201d Chadwick said, describing Saudi\u2019s approach to becoming a sporting superpower, adding that the sky is the limit in terms of cost. Saudi\u2019s love of soccer Saudi Arabia follows in the footsteps of several other countries \u2013 including China and Qatar in investing large sums of money to try and turn themselves into soccer powerhouses. It remains to be seen whether Saudi\u2019s turbocharged investment will have a lasting impact or resemble something like a costly rebranding effort. The Saudi national team has been to multiple World Cups, and the country\u2019s clubs have won multiple Asian titles. Saudi\u2019s victory over Argentina during last year\u2019s men\u2019s World Cup was hailed as one of the greatest upsets in tournament history, with the country\u2019s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud granting a national public holiday in recognition of the win. Club games can attract huge crowds in the Middle Eastern nation. \u201cFor example, Al-Ittihad against Al-Hilal, you\u2019re talking about drawing crowds of 40, 50, 60,000 people, these are games that are comparable in size to Chelsea vs. Arsenal, Manchester United vs. Manchester City,\u201d Chadwick said. Buying star players, some arguably past their prime, also provides an easy win for Saudi teams, according to Kieran Maguire, co-host of \u201cThe Price of Football\u201d podcast. \u201cFrom the Saudi authorities\u2019 point of view, they\u2019re getting a ready-made product. Everybody\u2019s heard of Benzema. Everybody\u2019s heard of Cristiano Ronaldo and so on,\u201d Maguire said. Saudi Arabia\u2019s lofty sporting ambitions don\u2019t end with the SPL or Newcastle United. The country is hosting the 2023 FIFA Club World Cup and is bidding to host the 2027 AFC Asian Cup. Several media reports also indicated that the Gulf kingdom was considering launching a bid for the 2030 FIFA men\u2019s World Cup alongside Greece and Egypt \u2013 although it is reportedly mulling pulling its candidacy. Meanwhile, the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) has agreed to a contract that will see the Spanish Super Cup played in Saudi Arabia until 2029, a deal that will earn the Spanish governing body between \u20ac35-45 million ($38-48 million) a year. Appealing to the youth Saudi Arabia has a very young population: the country\u2019s most recent census revealed 32.2 million people live in the country, nearly 42% of whom are foreign nationals \u2013 and 51% of the Saudi population are under the age of 30.\u202fOf this populace, Saudi authorities say that over 80% play, attend or follow soccer, the national sport. Chadwick explains that Saudi Arabia\u2019s government is concerned with the prospect of its younger members of society becoming radicalized or an anti-government sentiment bubbling up like that of the Arab Spring \u2013 and looks to offer its population a thriving soccer industry to keep it placated. Though the soccer industry generates employment, revenues, export earnings and inward investment, \u201cwhat is just as significant is the security of the royal family,\u201d Chadwick adds. The Arab Spring, a wave of pro-democracy protests that washed over the Middle East and North Africa in 2011, achieved mixed results. Four Arab dictators in Libya, Yemen, Egypt and Tunisia were toppled, offering a brief sense of victory for protesters, but, since then, new wars have prompted a retreat of popular movements in the region. Meanwhile, failed uprisings in Bahrain and eastern Saudi Arabia were followed by years-long crackdowns and a continuing civil war in Syria. \u201cWhat we\u2019re beginning to see in Saudi Arabia right now is the emergence of a new social contract. And the social contract essentially is catering for the needs of the Gen Z population,\u201d Chadwick said. \u201cYou want Ronaldo? You got him. You want some of the best football teams in the world? You got them. You want the World Cup to come to Saudi Arabia? You got it \u2026 But don\u2019t question us,\u201d Chadwick explained. Maguire agrees, noting that investing in soccer \u201ccan be seen as part of a much broader socio-economic plan, run by the Saudi authorities.\u201d At the same time, there has been \u201ca significant increase in the number of Saudi Arabians detained by the authorities, for example, for posting adverse comments on social media about the country\u201d this year, Chadwick told CNN. Human rights group Amnesty International told CNN that it has documented a rollback in human rights in Saudi Arabia, including an escalating crackdown on freedom of expression and an increased use of counterterrorism and cybercrime laws to silence dissent. Between 2022 and 2023, the organization said it has documented an increase in criminal prosecutions compared to previous years. In 2022, Amnesty reported the highest number of annual executions in the country in 30 years, with 196 people killed. \u201cReputation is important in terms of attracting foreign investment, and \u2026 Mohammed bin Salman, as much as he has significant financial muscle, needs foreign investing for the realization of his diversification,\u201d James Dorsey, the author of the syndicated column and blog, \u201cThe Turbulent World of Middle East Soccer,\u201d explains. Saudi Arabia is the world\u2019s biggest exporter of crude oil, and nearly two-thirds of its income still comes from selling fossil fuels. But with oil prices regularly dipping below what the Gulf state needs to balance its budget, it has focused efforts on trying to bring in investment from abroad along with its efforts to raise oil prices. Projections indicate the kingdom has around 20 years to diversify its economy to ensure it is more resilient, according to Chadwick \u2013 not least to fund its Vision 2030 projects, including the $500 billion Neom city, a 106 mile-long linear city called The Line and a futuristic plan to revamp the capital. \u201cPart of the grand vision of Mohammed bin Salman, looking forward to 2030, he does have his desire to make Saudi Arabia less dependent on natural resources to look at a post-fuel economy [involving] tourism, entertainment. If Saudi Arabia can become a hub for major sporting events, then that\u2019s a way of attracting interest to the country,\u201d said Maguire. CNN has reached out to the Saudi Ministry of Sport for comment on allegations that the kingdom has been rolling back human rights, and investing in soccer as a way of \u201csportswashing\u201d its image. In response to previous criticism about Saudi Arabia\u2019s purported \u201csportswashing,\u201d the kingdom\u2019s sports minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal said: \u201cPeople that don\u2019t know Saudi Arabia, have never been to Saudi Arabia, go out and talk about it as if they\u2019ve lived there for 30 years, 40 years. So I always tell people, come to Saudi. Come and see Saudi. \u201cSee what it is, see the people, meet the people. Look at what the country is doing for the future of the people in Saudi, then you can criticize as much as you like,\u201d he added. Lack of transparency: Saudi threatens new systems of governance\u202fin sports Saudi Arabia has already disrupted the golf industry and, with soccer, Maguire told CNN, \u201cthey feel that they can do that probably on a smaller scale, but perhaps, ultimately, to generate more interest in terms of eyeballs if they go down the same route.\u201d In 2021, the Saudi government-controlled PIF bankrolled LIV Golf, reportedly at a cost of $2 billion, attracting many of the sport\u2019s top players away from the US-based PGA Tour and Europe-based DP World Tour by offering big dollar prize money, with PGA Tour board member Jimmy Dunne raising fears that they might end up \u201cowning golf.\u201d Earlier this year, the US-based PGA Tour announced it was set to partner with the Saudi-backed breakaway LIV Golf, ending a feud that has dogged the men\u2019s professional game for the past year, with Dunne warning that sport\u2019s governing body had no choice but to reach the truce to retain some measure of control. \u201cThey have an unlimited horizon and an unlimited amount of money,\u201d he said at a contentious Senate hearing on the truce between the two tours. When it comes to soccer, Aleksander Ceferin, president of European football\u2019s governing body UEFA, has dismissed the competitive threat that the SPL could pose. \u201cAs far as I know, Mbappe and [Erling] Haaland don\u2019t dream of Saudi Arabia. I don\u2019t believe that the best players at the pinnacle of their careers would go to Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said last month. \u201cWhen people talk to me about the players who went there, nobody knows where they\u2019re playing.\u201d Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp took a different view, referring to the fact that the Saudi summer transfer window stays open after European clubs see theirs close: \u201cI don\u2019t know how stable it is and I think the next two weeks will show how much of a challenge it is because whatever happens there, no one can react anymore. \u201cI don\u2019t know where it will lead to but it feels rather like a threat or a concern than not because I can\u2019t see how we really deny it in these moments, what can we do?\u201d he added. Still, the new SPL director of football, Michael Emenalo, says what Saudi soccer is doing is \u201cno different from what the Premier League have done.\u201d \u201cThere was a time when it was all about Italy. There was a time when it was all about Spain. What we\u2019re looking for in the industry is an opportunity to compete, and to compete on an even scale and to improve upon whatever exists in the industry,\u201d said Emenalo in a press release sent to CNN. New Saudi Pro League Chief Operating Officer Carlo Nohra told CNN that there is logic behind the league\u2019s strategy of money is no object to lure international stars. \u201cWe can\u2019t expect to be paying market value to entice people to come here at this early stage in our development.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0But analysts say that the difference lies in the level of transparency, which \u201csimply doesn\u2019t exist in Saudi Arabia,\u201d Chadwick explained to CNN. European soccer governing body UEFA has financial fair play (FFP) rules on teams\u2019 spending, while Major League Soccer in the US has a salary cap for its clubs. Nohra told CNN that, eventually, the country wants 0.3% of its GDP to be from soccer to make it similar to that of the Premier League on the UK economy \u2013 up from its current value of \u201c0.000 something.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve got no chance to get into that figure at present,\u201d Maguire explained, but added that the SPL could perhaps move into the top 10 of the world\u2019s domestic leagues. \u201cThat is feasible given the amount of money that they\u2019re spending.\u201d \u201cI think they\u2019re realistic. They don\u2019t say that they\u2019re going to overtake La Liga or the Premier League or the major European leagues,\u201d Maguire said. When the Peterson Institute for International Economics compared the world\u2019s sovereign wealth funds on criteria including governance, transparency and accountability in 2019, the PIF scored well below average on a measure combining these criteria, and ranked in the bottom 10 out of 64 funds, just above Russian Direct Investment Fund. CNN has reached out to the PIF for further comment about its investments in sport, particularly soccer and golf, and criticisms about its lack of transparency. Chadwick raised concerns over how a lack of financial rules affecting Saudi clubs might dilute UEFA\u2019s FFP regulations, as well as those of the Premier League, or impact world soccer governing body FIFA\u2019s systems of governance. The lack of transparency in Saudi Arabia\u2019s wealth fund has already raised suspicions in the US golfing and political spheres. Earlier this summer, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations launched an inquiry about the PGA Tour\u2019s agreement with the PIF-controlled LIV Golf. Chadwick told CNN that, so long as there is no independent organization that monitors the reporting of every league\u2019s financial endeavors, \u201cnobody really knows for sure what the accurate financial information is.\u201d \u201cThis vacuum [of information], this uncertainty is wrapped in a veneer of lobbying, which is intended to either overinflate or underinflate player transfer values and salary information because it serves a political purpose,\u201d Chadwick says, adding that this purpose is \u201csignaling.\u201d \u201cIt is almost as though football players are becoming kind of geopolitical pawns in some ways.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/09/20/sport/saudi-arabia-soccer-spl-bin-salman-intl-spt-cmd-dg/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Reese nearly had a double-double at halftime of the Sky\u2019s 84-71 loss to\u00a0the Seattle Storm. However, it wasn\u2019t until a layup midway through the third quarter that the rookie made history. She finished with 17 points, 14 rebounds and four steals. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to be consistent for my teammates, doing whatever I can to help my team,\u201d Reese said after the game. \u201cI think I didn\u2019t do enough tonight but just being able to be there for my teammates and knowing that I have a job to do no matter if I\u2019m a rookie or a vet.\u201d Chicago led for most of the first half after jumping out to a 12-3 lead in the first quarter. The Sky held Seattle to three points on offense until Nneka Ogwumike made a three-pointer with 2:34 left in the first quarter. Seattle kept inching back into the game and trailed 39-31 at halftime. With Ogwumike and Jewell Loyd leading the charge, the Storm broke out on a 16-2 run to rally and take a five-point lead in the third quarter. The Sky had no answer to the Storm\u2019s hot shooting, trailing by as much as 14 in the fourth quarter before orchestrating a 14-3 run to cut the deficit to three points with 2:49 remaining in the game. Seattle responded with a 12-0 run to close out the victory at Climate Pledge Arena. Ogwumike finished the game with 24 points and 13 rebounds, while Loyd added 20 points. Meanwhile, the 22-year-old Reese made history last week, after recording her 10th\u00a0straight double-double in the team\u2019s loss to the Minnesota Lynx to pass Parker, who had nine straight at the end of the 2009 season for the most in a single season. The two-time MVP Parker extended her streak to 12 total at the beginning of the 2010 season before Reese matched it on Friday night and then broke the record Sunday. Reese entered Sunday night\u2019s game averaging 13.9 points, 11.7 rebounds and 1.4 steals per game so far in her rookie season. She currently leads the league in rebounds. \u201cShe\u2019s the G.O.A.T,\u201d Reese said of Parker. \u201cI\u2019ve always respected CP3, and I try even to take some things from her game and try to add them to mine. And just being able to be named with an amazing player like that is always going to be special to me. The No. 7 pick in the WNBA Draft is considered a frontrunner for Rookie of the Year, alongside the Indiana Fever\u2019s Caitlin Clark. Clark on Saturday made some history of her own, becoming the first rookie in WNBA history to record a triple double. According to the NBA, a double-double is achieved when a player reaches 10 or more in two of the statistical categories of points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks. A triple-double is achieved when a player reaches double figures in three of those categories, it says.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/07/sport/angel-reese-double-double-chicago-sky/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2023_10_30_sport_enhanced-games-olympics-doping-spt-intl", "text": "The 2024 Olympics are fast approaching and as athletes gear up for one of the world\u2019s most prestigious sporting events, one entrepreneur has a different idea of what \u201cfaster, higher, stronger\u201d \u2013 the former motto of the Games \u2013 might represent. The Enhanced Games says it is an \u201calternative\u201d to what it calls the \u201ccorrupt Olympics Games.\u201d Athletes competing at the Enhanced Games will be free to use performance-enhancing drugs, they won\u2019t be tested and will be under no obligation to declare which substances they have taken in order to compete. That\u2019s quite a contrast to the Olympics\u2019 doping protocols. The International Testing Agency (ITA) will be responsible for looking after Paris 2024\u2019s anti-doping program. Six years ago, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which oversees the Olympics, delegated its entire clean sport program to the ITA. However, historically the Olympic Games have been dogged by a series of doping and kickback scandals. When approached for comment on the Enhanced Games and allegations of corruption, the IOC told CNN Sport that \u201cthe idea does not merit any comment.\u201d \u2018Danger to health, to sport\u2019 CNN Sport interviewed a number of experts in the field of doping for this story, who expressed concern that the Enhanced Games was an extremely dangerous proposition. Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, who exposed Russia\u2019s state-sponsored doping program \u2013 a massive, years-long effort which benefited more than 1,000 athletes between 2011 and 2015 \u2013 said that the Enhanced Games is a \u201cdanger to health, to sport.\u201d Whether the Enhanced Games will ever take place remains an open question, but the very idea is drawing considerable blowback from leading anti-doping officials and sporting organizations. The Enhanced Games is the brainchild of businessman Aron D\u2019Souza. He is also the founding editor of \u201cThe Journal Jurisprudence,\u201d a quarterly publication on legal philosophy, according to his website, which also describes him as an \u201cavid athlete.\u201d Recently, D\u2019Souza told CNN Sport he has \u201csigned term sheets with prominent venture capital firms\u201d in relation to the Enhanced Games and is \u201cwaiting on the lawyers to finish long-form drafting.\u201d He also said that a funding announcement is planned for early December. Although not legally binding, term sheets are a serious expression of intent by both sides, setting out the broad principles of an agreement. D\u2019Souza believes what he calls a \u201cscience-driven\u201d competition is the next step in the evolution of sport, suggesting that the absence of drug testing will level the playing field. According to a 2020 study from Raphael Faiss, Research Manager at the centre of Research and Expertise in anti-doping sciences at the University of Lausanne, data from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) suggests less than 2% of athletes dope. However, Faiss told CNN Sport the number of athletes taking performance-enhancing drugs is likely significantly higher; his research, based on two international major athletic events in 2011 and 2013, suggests the figure could be between 15 to 18%. Faiss and his team compared athletes\u2019 blood results collected by WADA-accredited labs to values from healthy adults, as well as doped and undoped athletes; the closer the values are to those of subjects to whom erythropoietin (EPO, which is used in blood doping) had been administered, the higher the chances that they\u2019re actually doping. This analysis, Faiss said, is not proof of doping, but is a \u201crobust way\u201d of analyzing the data, allowing scientists to make an estimate for doping prevalence, as well as targeting athletes most likely to be doping. In written comments to CNN Sport, WADA said: \u201cDetermining the level of [doping] prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed,\u201d explaining that, since 2017, a \u201cprevalence working group\u201d has been established to \u201cdetermine if strategies, reliable methods and tools can be developed to adequately assess the prevalence of doping in sports.\u201d WADA told CNN Sport that the group has delivered \u201cseveral recommendations and guidance to WADA but not the final ones yet.\u201d WADA has reservations about Faiss\u2019 study and pointed to the \u201ccomplexity of trying to measure [doping] prevalence,\u201d highlighting that reports have \u201cgreatly varying results.\u201d The anti-doping organization added: \u201cNo single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline.\u201d \u201cComparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system\u2019s testing figures isn\u2019t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence. \u201cIn any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries \u2013 it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others. \u201cThe Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures.\u201d Editor\u2019s note: You can find WADA\u2019s full statement at the bottom of this article.\u00a0 \u2018A dangerous clown show\u2019 Travis Tygart, the Chief Executive Officer at the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), told CNN Sport that the idea of an Enhanced Games is \u201cfarcical \u2026 likely illegal in many [US] states\u201d and \u201ca dangerous clown show, not real sport.\u201d Substances such as anabolic steroids \u2013 which help to build muscle mass by enabling athletes to train harder and recover quickly from strenuous workouts \u2013 are classified as a Schedule III drug by the US Drug Enforcement Administration. When asked whether anabolic steroids will be allowed at the games and whether athletes would be tested for illegal drugs such as cocaine, D\u2019Souza told CNN Sport that \u201cwe will not be drug testing at the games.\u201d He added: \u201cWe do not propose to regulate what athletes use.\u201d Anabolic steroids may be prescribed by a licensed physician for the treatment of certain conditions such as testosterone deficiency, but if used in the US without a prescription from a licensed physician, a first conviction could result in a one-year prison sentence and a $1,000 fine. But that isn\u2019t the only potential legal jeopardy the Enhanced Games faces, according to American lawyer Jim Walden, who represents Russian whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov. \u201cIf you look at the Enhanced Games website, it\u2019s almost as though they\u2019re advertising their disregard of the law,\u201d Walden told CNN Sport. \u201cThey wrap themselves up in what I will call the cloak of legitimacy by using phrases like body autonomy and coming out as an enhanced athlete. \u201cI hope they\u2019re thinking hard about how they\u2019re going to pull this off in the world in which the FBI has a specific unit that is called the Sports and Gaming Initiative that\u2019s focusing on these very issues.\u201d The Sports and Gaming Initiative was developed to \u201cprotect athletes and sporting institutions in the United States from criminal threats and influences,\u201d according to the government website. The initiative works in partnership with sports leagues and governing bodies, international law enforcement and independent watchdog groups to tackle crimes such as fraud, doping and match-fixing; criminal activities, it says, \u201cdegrade the integrity of sports and competition and erode public confidence in these cherished institutions.\u201d \u201cThe use of doping substances is not acceptable in modern sports,\u201d Rodchenkov said in his written comments to CNN. \u201cPromotion and advertising of banned substances is against sport rules and moral, letter and spirit. \u201cIt might bring an extreme harm to young generation[s] of athletes who mistakenly could believe in benefits of [the] Enhanced Games.\u201d Rodchenkov, the protagonist of the Oscar-winning Netflix documentary Icarus who is currently under FBI protection, also believes that the Enhanced Games\u2019 organizers \u201cmight get investigated [\u2026] under the Rodchenkov Act.\u201d The Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act, named after the whistleblower, allows the US to impose criminal sanctions on individuals involved in doping activities at international events. However, the Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act does not apply to sporting events that don\u2019t adopt the WADA code, which the Enhanced Games wouldn\u2019t do. Rodchenkov also added that WADA athletes could not have any affiliation or contact with so-called enhanced athletes, or they would risk being charged under Article 2.10 \u2013 \u201cProhibited Association by an Athlete or Other Person\u201d \u2013 of the World Anti-Doping Code. USADA\u2019s Tygart also told CNN Sport: \u201cNo one really wants our children growing up idolizing unbridled drug use in sport, even if some profiteers think otherwise.\u201d D\u2019Souza insists his motivation for founding the Enhanced Games isn\u2019t financial. If he had wanted to make more money, he says he\u2019d continue to be a \u201cquiet, mild-mannered venture capitalist.\u201d \u201cI do think fundamentally that consumers want this [the Enhanced Games] and athletes want this because if you go to the cinemas, no one\u2019s interested in histories in the past anymore,\u201d said D\u2019Souza. \u201cThey\u2019re interested in superheroes and technology in the future. And this is literally what we are bringing to a reality.\u201d \u2018The dirtiest Olympics in history\u2019 According to Pierre de Coubertin \u2013 the founder of the modern Olympics \u2013 \u201cfor every man, woman and child, it [sport] offers an opportunity for self-improvement.\u201d Except historically, many athletes competing in the Olympics have taken the idea of self-improvement too far, notably at London 2012, which Rodchenkov has previously called \u201cthe dirtiest Olympics in history.\u201d When the ITA concluded its re-analysis program for the London Games, it found 73 anti-doping rule violations, which led to the withdrawal of 31 medals and reallocation of 46 Olympic medals across the sports of athletics, weightlifting, wrestling and canoeing. Doping has been an issue at the Olympics throughout the event\u2019s history, and the 100-meter final at the 1988 Games has become one of the most infamous and controversial moments in sporting history. Six of the eight finalists \u2013 notably the winner, Ben Johnson \u2013 who lined up on that September day in Seoul 35 years ago would fail drug tests themselves or be implicated in drug use during their careers. Despite some athletes continuing to cheat, global antidoping efforts remain ever-present, according to the testers. Recent out-of-competition (OOC) testing data published by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) highlights positive results from steps being taken to keep \u201celite podiums and finals clean,\u201d according to the anti-doping organization. Data focused on OOC testing ahead of last year\u2019s World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon, shows how resources and testing are targeting those athletes most likely to win medals and make finals. Whilst only 39% of the athletes in Eugene had three or more OOC tests in the 10 months leading up the event, 81% of top-eight finishers had three or more OOC tests. Yet the cat and mouse game between testers and athletes using banned substances continues. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly about the question of timing and targeting the right athletes,\u201d said Faiss. Given that athletes have their blood values regularly monitored, it is \u201cgetting more difficult for athletes to use high doses [of drugs such as EPO], but they would still be using micro dosing.\u201d By taking EPO late at night and drinking enough water, the substance would not be detected in athletes the following morning, according to Faiss, though athletes suspected of blood doping could be tested in the middle of the night. \u201cAthletes are actually getting back to very simple ways of doping with steroids,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cEPO is quite simple to use, but still tricky to detect.\u201d Athletes \u201cuse the drugs that are actively working.\u201d When it comes to new substances such as Roxadustat \u2013 the drug that two-time grand slam champion Simona Halep has recently been given a four-year ban for taking, although she denies ever knowingly or intentionally taking any prohibited substance \u2013 Faiss said athletes \u201care likely to use substances with a very short half-life in [the] body that are mimicking processes of the oxygen carrying improvements through the EPO channels.\u201d Roxadustat has an elimination half-life of 10-16 hours, according to the National Institutes of Health. Athletes are \u201cseeking to find substances where the [half-life] time window is very short, to make sure that if they are not tested at the right moment, they won\u2019t be caught,\u201d said Faiss. \u2018Challenge for sporting competition\u2019 Michele Verroken, the founding director of consultancy group Sporting Integrity, believes an antidoping system is required that will \u201cgive a lot more credibility, a lot more immediacy to verifying results, if we\u2019re going to keep the hearts and minds of athletes.\u201d Verroken also questions what\u2019s stopping an athlete from cheating if they only get caught 10 years after the event, or not at all. Under the World Anti-Doping Code, there is a 10-year statute of limitations on samples taken from 2015 onwards. Verroken told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games is \u201csetting a really interesting challenge for sporting competition.\u201d Not unsurprisingly, many sporting bodies have condemned the event. The Australian Olympic Committee called it \u201cdangerous and irresponsible,\u201d saying that \u201cthe world needs better than this.\u201d UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) said it \u201cis extremely concerned by the concept of an Enhanced Games,\u201d adding that \u201cthere is no place in sport for performance enhancing drugs, nor the Enhanced Games.\u201d UKAD\u2019s Director of Operations, Hamish Coffey, told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games sets a \u201chugely dangerous precedent,\u201d expressing concern over the kind of messaging the event sends to the next generation of athletes. \u2018Very accomplished athletes\u2019 When CNN Sport spoke to D\u2019Souza shortly after the proposed event\u2019s announcement, he said that 368 athletes had enquired about the Enhanced Games and more had messaged via social media. The organization\u2019s Chief Athletes Officer and former Olympian Brett Fraser, who swam for the Cayman Islands at three Olympic Games, told CNN Sport that \u201cvery accomplished athletes\u201d at the level of Olympic finalists have reached out \u201cto understand more about how the first Games will take place and how they can become involved.\u201d Fraser added that Enhanced Games organizers \u201calready have an Olympic medallist\u201d for their athlete commission, though he didn\u2019t specify who that was. He also said there has been \u201ca lot of positive feedback and a lot of acceptance and excitement from younger generations.\u201d Nonetheless, none of the athletes appear prepared to speak publicly at this stage. For those who do want to compete, the Enhanced Games would be an annual event with five categories \u2013 track and field, swimming, weightlifting, gymnastics and martial arts. The huge cost of hosting an Olympic Games is no secret, with countries often striving to create bigger and better spectacles by blowing their budget. Tokyo 2021 had the largest Olympic sports program in history, with 33 sports competitions in 42 venues culminating in 339 medal events. The Covid-impacted Games were delivered with a final expenditure of $13 billion \u2013 almost double the $7.3 billion that was originally forecast. Meanwhile, keeping the IOC\u2019s philosophy of \u201clower-impact Games\u201d in mind, 95% of venues will be pre-existing facilities at the Paris 2024 Olympics. D\u2019Souza said the Enhanced Games will focus on fewer sports, reuse existing infrastructure and fund the event through the private sector to \u201cdeliver a high-impact yet cost-efficient games\u201d so profits can be shared with the athletes. He added that the Enhanced Games is looking for a seven-figure prize pool for any athlete potentially breaking Usain Bolt\u2019s 100-meter world record of 9.58 seconds. \u201cI\u2019ve had conversations with people who are top-10 sprinters in the world who are going to the next Olympics, and they said [\u2026] if there\u2019s a million-dollar prize to break the 100m world record, I\u2019ll be there,\u201d said D\u2019Souza. Universal basic income and mental health support to athletes will also be part of an \u201cenhanced athletes programme.\u201d When asked who would take responsibility if an athlete competing at the Enhanced Games were to suffer fatal consequences, D\u2019Souza told CNN Sport that \u201cour athletes at the games will be the most monitored athletes in history.\u201d He said: \u201cWe will focus on athlete safety by mandating athletes have pre-competition full-system clinical screenings including blood tests and EKGs.\u201d \u201cThis will ensure that athletes are healthy to complete and not at risk of major health complications.\u201d D\u2019Souza also said that athletes will sign waivers in order\u00a0to compete. As it stands, no venues are officially in place to host the event and D\u2019Souza admits its scale will be dependent on funding and media partnerships. \u201cWe\u2019re in commercial negotiations with venues and media partners at the moment,\u201d added D\u2019Souza, who said the first Enhanced Games will be at a university campus or a similar facility in the south of the US and that a number of trademarks have been filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. \u2018Undermine the very purpose of sport\u2019 Elite performance coach Trevor Painter, who has worked with a number of Olympic and international sprinters and middle-distance runners, said he would \u201cnever\u201d coach an athlete taking performance-enhancing drugs because it would go against his morals as a coach. \u201cHaving been involved with many athletes that have lost in many ways to the cheats, I won\u2019t be engaging with [the Enhanced Games],\u201d Painter told CNN Sport. If it goes ahead as planned in December 2024, D\u2019Souza insists that the Enhanced Games will unlock the potential of humanity. But according to John William Devine, Senior Lecturer in Ethics, Sport and Exercise Sciences at Swansea University in Wales, the Enhanced Games will make sporting competition more unfair than it already is and even \u201cundermine the very purpose of the sport in question.\u201d Devine told CNN Sport that \u201cperformance-enhancing drugs don\u2019t actually lead to better athletic performance. They obscure athletic performance.\u201d He added that, although the Enhanced Games may look very similar to the Olympics, the nature of the activity will be different, raising the question: \u201cTo what extent is drug-assisted performance reflective of the athletes\u2019 sporting excellence?\u201d WADA response in full: Determining the level of prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed. That is why we set up a\u00a0Working Group on Doping Prevalence\u00a0in 2017. Measuring doping prevalence is a difficult and complex process. Through its work, the group found a huge variance across the many prevalence studies that have been carried out, leading it to publish guidelines on how to improve the quality of measuring prevalence. WADA is currently developing a tool that Anti-Doping Organizations can use to evaluate the effectiveness of their programs. WADA is well aware of the [Faiss] study. Indeed, one of the contributors, Prof. Martial Saugy, is a member of the Working Group. This study is one of many that helps to inform the Group\u2019s work. It is a very narrow study. It looks at two events, in a single sport, held 10 and 12 years ago, using just one method of measurement (the Athlete Biological Passport (ABP)). As far as I am aware, there is no comparable data from more recent World Championships in the same sport. Given its limited scope, it is important that this study be analyzed within the wider context of other studies and not be taken in isolation. This study also highlights the complexity of trying to measure prevalence. It is the third published paper that sought to measure prevalence at the 2011 Athletics World Championships. Each reported greatly varying results. The fact is no single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline. Results will always come with caveats and margins of error and will be based on a variety of methods, including self-report questionnaires, analytical methods (like ABP and testing data) and other methods to give a more rounded estimate of what the most likely figure would be. Comparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system\u2019s testing figures isn\u2019t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence. In any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries \u2013 it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others. The Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/10/30/sport/enhanced-games-olympics-doping-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Bouzas Maneiro, who is the world No. 83, took just over an hour to dispatch Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 6-4, 6-2. According to the WTA, Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 is only the second defending\u00a0women\u2019s\u00a0champion to be ousted in Wimbledon\u2019s first round\u00a0in the last 30 years. Steffi Graf was the other champion to fall at the first hurdle in the defense of her title, when she was defeated by Lori McNeil\u00a0in 1994. Bouzas Maneiro picked up what was comfortably the biggest win of her career. This was just the third grand slam main draw of her career, while she\u2019d previously only logged one match against a top 10 player \u2013 a loss to Jelena Ostapenko in Madrid earlier this year. The 21-year-old Spaniard was ruthless throughout the match, converting all five of her break point opportunities. She clinched victory with a spectacular backhand winner down the line that left her opponent rooted to the spot. Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 recently had suffered a right hip injury ahead of the tournament, when the Czech slipped and fell on the grass at a tune-up event in Berlin. She was forced to retire from that Berlin second-round match, which occurred less than two weeks before Wimbledon. But it\u2019s a disappointing loss for Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1, who loses almost 2,000 ranking points as a result and will drop from her No. 6 ranking. The 25-year-old Czech player has had a handful of poor results in 2024 and has not reached a final since she famously defeated Ons Jabeur last year to become Wimbledon\u2019s first unseeded women\u2019s champion. Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 appeared to be turning things around at the French Open  \u2013 where she reached the quarterfinals before being defeated by the all-conquering Iga \u015awi\u0105tek \u2013 but was unable to carry that form into the grass court season.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/sport/marketa-vondrousova-jessica-bouzas-maneiro-wimbledon-upset-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Turkey defender Samet Akaydin had given his side the lead 10 minutes before halftime with a powerful header from a sumptuous Arda G\u00fcler cross. After consistent pressure on the Turkey goal, the Netherlands eventually equalized through a thumping header from defender Stefan de Vrij. The Netherlands then took the lead six minutes later when Mert M\u00fcld\u00fcr touched the ball into his own net under pressure from Cody Gakpo to score an unfortunate own goal. The Netherlands will play England in the semifinals on Wednesday, July 10 in Dortmund. Turkey was playing without its match-winner in the round of 16, Merih Demiral, after he was suspended for two games following a controversial hand gesture made by the defender in the previous round. Demiral scored twice in Turkey\u2019s 2-1 win against Austria and celebrated by making a gesture known as the \u201cwolf salute,\u201d which is associated with the Turkish right-wing extremist group \u201cGrey Wolves.\u201d \u201cDoes anyone say that the Germans have an eagle on their jerseys? Does anyone say that the French have a rooster on their jerseys?\u201d Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who was at the game in Berlin, told Turkish broadcaster TRT on Friday. The atmosphere inside Berlin\u2019s Olympic Stadium in Berlin was electric, with the combination of Netherlands fans dressed all in orange and the vocal backing of Turkey fans \u2013 Germany has a large Turkish diaspora \u2013 for their team providing a dramatic backdrop to the game. The action on the pitch didn\u2019t quite live up to the energy in the stands in the early proceedings though, with both teams struggling to find any cutting edge. Dutch striker Memphis Depay was heavily involved but lacked the cutting edge required to find the back of the net. Demiral had scored with two powerful headers in the win against Austria and Akaydin replicated his absent teammate\u2019s aerial threat by rising highest at the back post to head past Dutch goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen after 19-year-old sensation G\u00fcler had delivered a bewitching cross as Turkey took the lead. After the halftime break, the introduction of Wout Weghorst almost paid immediate dividends for the Netherlands, with his knockdown falling inches away from Depay to tap home. Meanwhile, G\u00fcler remained in the thick of the action with his freekick from distance bending and crashing against the Netherlands\u2019 post as the Real Madrid star continued to impress. Although the Netherlands continued to push, it was Turkey who continued to look the most dangerous team, with Verbruggen having to deny Kenan Y\u0131ld\u0131z midway through the second half. The Netherlands\u2019s equalizer also came from a header with Depay putting in an inviting ball for De Vrij to power past the helpless Mert G\u00fcnok in goal. Minutes later, the Dutch took the lead when an inviting cross from Denzel Dumfries caused panic Turkish box and a combination of Gakpo and Mert M\u00fcld\u00fcr ended with the ball of the back of the net. Turkey ramped up the pressure in search of an equalizrer with Micky van de Ven and Jerdy Schouten having to make a vital blocks to deny shots on goal. Agonizingly for Turkey the ball then hit Semih K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7soy\u2019s knee at the back post and looked to be heading towards the Dutch goal only for Verbruggen to somehow turn it away and let out a cheer of celebration afterwards. As Turkey frantically pushed for a second goal, every small challenge was contested hotly and Bertu\u011f Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m was shown a red card on the bench for his protestations.

Rybakina, the No. 4 seed, was involved a hard-fought contest earlier on Wednesday until opponent Anna Kalinskaya had to retire in the second set due to a wrist injury. At least 36 people were killed across Ukraine in Russian attacks on Monday, Ukrainian authorities said. Kyiv\u2019s Okhmatdyt hospital has been crucial in supporting some the sickest children from across the country. Two adults were killed and 16 others \u2013 including seven children \u2013 were\u00a0injured in the attack, according to Kyiv\u2019s mayor Vitaliy Klytchko Some 137 people were wounded in the attacks which left nearly 100 buildings damaged. Svitolina said being able to continue using her platform at Wimbledon to maintain awareness of the war \u201creally motivated\u201d her during Monday\u2019s win. \u201cIt\u2019s [an] incredibly sad day today for all Ukrainians,\u201d Svitolina said in her post-match press conference. \u201cIt was really difficult for me to really be here in a way and do anything. I just wanted to be in my room, just be there with my emotions, with everything. \u201cWhen you have these sad days where you don\u2019t want to do anything, it was this kind of day for me. It\u2019s difficult really to explain, I guess, because of course for us Ukrainians, it\u2019s very close to our heart and [a] very sensitive topic, very sensitive emotions that we feel every single day. \u201cBut today was one of the days where it was even more difficult because the missile landed on the hospital, the kids\u2019 hospital.\u201d Svitolina added she had received \u201cso many messages\u201d after her win and said the victory was a \u201csmall light that brought a happy moment for Ukrainian people.\u201d Daria Tarasova-Markina in Kyiv and Sugam Pokharel in London contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/sport/elina-svitolina-black-ribbon-wimbledon-russian-missile-strikes-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_sport_kathleen-noble-rowing-uganda-paris-olympics-spt-intl", "text": "From learning how to row in boats patched together with duct tape to competing at the world championships in a different sport entirely, Kathleen Noble\u2019s rise to the apex of rowing has certainly been unconventional. Her journey now sees the 29-year-old set to become a two-time Olympian \u2013 Noble represented Uganda at the Tokyo Games \u2013 when she competes at Paris 2024. She is Uganda\u2019s first Olympic rowing participant, as well as the African nation\u2019s first and only White Olympian across any sporting discipline. A prodigious swimmer in her youth, Noble represented Uganda at the 2012 World Swimming Championships at just 17 years of age. Then, on a whim during her time as a student at Princeton University, Noble was convinced to try her hand at rowing. \u201cWhen I took my first steps into the sport, I had no thoughts or intentions of competing at a high level and certainly couldn\u2019t have imagined that this would be the direction that things would go,\u201d Noble tells CNN Sport. \u201cTo be honest, it is still a bit surreal to be competing on a stage like this. I don\u2019t think it was until they actually told me that Uganda wanted to send me to the Olympic qualifiers that I really thought, \u2018Oh, okay, maybe there\u2019s something here.\u2019\u201d Equipment issues The sport of rowing is still very much in its nascent stages across many parts of Africa, including Uganda. It was properly introduced to the country back in 2009 when the World Rowing Federation sent out a shipment of donated boats to help to grow a sport which carries with it significant financial entry barriers. It was on these boats that Noble learned to row skull (individual), as opposed to her time rowing crew (as a team in one boat) at university. Whilst the thought of training on Lake Victoria, one of Africa\u2019s Great Lakes and the world\u2019s largest tropical lake, may bring with it a sense of charm and serenity, trying to prepare to compete at Olympic level just isn\u2019t feasible given the lack of opportunities and investment afforded to rowing within Uganda, a reality which sees Noble now train out of Tennessee under former US rower James Martinez. \u201cThere is no history of rowing in Uganda. I mean, I\u2019m literally the first person, male or female, to even qualify for the Olympics,\u201d Noble says. \u201cIt is still extremely niche, and the community is very small. I probably know every single rower in the country personally. \u201cBack in 2016, I took eight months off from university to row in Uganda and I\u2019m so grateful that I did because I got to experience first-hand all the struggles that rowers back home go through on a daily basis. \u201cNot only is there a lack of competition and adequate coaching, but there is a lack of most basic essentials, such as having properly functioning equipment. \u201cWhen I was rowing on Lake Victoria, we were still using the boats donated back in 2009. We would be duct-taping them and trying to get people to patch them up with fiberglass for us.\u201d It is not just a lack of equipment which has hampered rowing\u2019s growth in the east African country. Governance is also a major issue, and the absence of proper oversight has seen many athletes leave the sport in recent times, according to Noble, due to \u201cpromises being made but not always being kept.\u201d The only way the sport has a chance to progress is through the help and funding from outside donors such as the World Rowing Federation. Muhumuza Rodrick Chandi,\u00a0the technical director of the Uganda\u00a0Rowing Federation, tells CNN Sport that the price of equipment and a lack of coaches has been an issue in the country. \u201cIt is true that there is a lack of coaches as most qualified ones have left Uganda in search of greener pastures,\u201d he says.\u00a0\u201cRowing, like most sports in Uganda, is voluntary, so once these coaches get better opportunities they migrate or leave the sport altogether. \u201cThe Ugandan Rowing Federation does suffer from a lack of funding, mainly because it doesn\u2019t get much budgetary support from the National Council of Sports as it\u2019s considered a small sport.\u201d \u2018Honor\u2019 representing Uganda Born in Nakaseke, central Uganda, in 1994, Noble is the daughter of Irish missionaries. \u201cUganda was a fantastic place to grow up in many ways, whether it be the great weather all year round or the friendly and cheerful nature of the people,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut as a White, blonde child, I maybe would have had an aversion to going out in public due to the amount of attention I\u2019d have gotten.\u201d Despite her differences, of which Noble is acutely aware, sport has allowed her to form a deeper connection with her birthplace. \u201cEven though I have Ugandan citizenship, there is an identity to being Ugandan which is about coming from one of the local tribes and having land and a history and ancestors going back a long way,\u201d she says. \u201cI respect that, but at the same time, I did grow up in Uganda. It\u2019s a place that is important to me and it does mean a lot to me to have people accept me as being Ugandan. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge honor to represent my country. It\u2019s been the way that I\u2019ve felt the most connection to my identity as a Ugandan. Growing up there, when people ask you where you\u2019re from, I would say Ireland, even though I was born and grew up there. \u201cBut I feel like as I\u2019ve gotten deeper into representing and rowing for the country, I have felt more strongly that I am Ugandan.\u201d Noble\u2019s acceptance by Ugandan sports fans has also been a great source of encouragement. While she says that she will occasionally receive the odd message on social media criticizing her for representing the country, the overwhelming majority of both fan and media messaging has been support and pride for raising the profile of Ugandan rowing. \u201cYou\u2019re always going to have haters and people who want to try to knock you down, that\u2019s kind of to be expected in high level sport nowadays with social media \u2026 but I find it extremely touching that whenever I am met with negativity, a barrage of positivity will follow,\u201d says Noble. \u201cI\u2019m very, very grateful for that.\u201d Platform for change Noble, on top of her sporting ambitions, works as a software engineer in Tennessee and, alongside her husband, is a homesteader with a small-scale farm producing food and animals for themselves. Like every athlete, she hopes that her Olympic journey will culminate atop the podium, but she does also head to Paris with a compelling sense of realism. \u201cRowing is not really a sport where you wake up and just have a great day and row faster than you ever have before,\u201d says Noble. \u201cIt is a little bit more deterministic than that. Sports that are really based around cardiovascular strength tend to remove that element of major surprise around results. I\u2019m not going to flat out say that my goal isn\u2019t to medal, but at the same time I need to be realistic.\u201d Winning a medal is not the only means by which you can determine an Olympian\u2019s success, though, with Noble hoping that her exposure during the Games can help to elevate rowing back in Uganda, ensuring that she is no longer its sole representative. \u201cI feel a sense of responsibility to try and help support athletes back home,\u201d she says. \u201cWhether that correlates to me having to do well, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily true. I get a lot of press whether I come first or last. \u201cI believe that the actual position that I come is less important than the spotlight that exists around the Olympics. That gives me the platform to raise awareness about the limitations and struggles that athletes have in Uganda to a global audience.\u201d Rowing, particularly singles rowing, can be a very isolating sport, a fact that Noble can attest to. But come July 26 when the Paris Games get underway, she will have the backing of an entire nation eager to witness what will, no matter the end result, be more Olympic history for Uganda.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/sport/kathleen-noble-rowing-uganda-paris-olympics-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_sport_nick-bienz-pga-tour-beer-qualifier-spt-intl", "text": "There are a variety of methods golfers can call upon to soothe their anxiety in the face of a dreaded playoff. Some might head out to the driving range, others may listen to music or discuss strategy with their caddie. Faced with an unprecedented level of stress, Nick Bienz took a more commonplace approach to stress relief: he headed to the bar. Three beers and eight nerve-wracking holes later, the 27-year-old stamped his ticket to his first ever PGA Tour event. The Golf Galaxy employee will not be available to work this week, after he secured his place in the field at Thursday\u2019s Rocket Mortgage Classic with a terrific \u2013 and slightly tipsy \u2013 qualifying performance on Monday. Hoagland, Indiana, native Bienz had faced an anxious wait to discover his fate after five birdies and an eagle had sent him back to the clubhouse atop the leaderboard with a bogey-free seven-under 65. With multiple groups still finishing their rounds at The Orchards Golf Club in Washington, Michigan, the Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) alumni headed to the bar to summon some Dutch courage. While nursing his second beer, he was joined at the table by Ryan French \u2013 or, as he is better known on social media, Monday Q Info \u2013 who has amassed 170,000 followers in his coverage of those hopefuls grinding away on golf\u2019s developmental tours and qualifying events. \u201cI need every ounce of alcohol right now to calm the nervous system and not try to vomit on myself,\u201d Bienz told French in a video shared on X, formerly known as Twitter. \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019re at right now.\u201d It was uncharted territory for Bienz, who explained to French that he works at Golf Galaxy \u2013 a golf equipment and apparel retailer with stores across the US \u2013 to help fund his professional career, arriving early or staying late to take advantage of the shop\u2019s in-house practice facilities. The biggest event he had played to date was a state open, according to French. He had attempted to qualify for events before, including several on the Korn Ferry Tour \u2013 the PGA Tour\u2019s developmental circuit \u2013 but had never been so close to getting over the line. Having previously packed a week\u2019s worth of clothes in anticipation of making it through, Bienz \u2013 chasing any way to change his luck \u2013 had only brought enough for Monday. \u201cI think I play better when I don\u2019t have any expectations, to the point where I didn\u2019t even bring any clothes beyond today,\u201d Bienz told the PGA Tour. \u201cI had to go buy underwear and socks last night because I ran out of those.\u201d \u2018I have to call my boss\u2019 Bienz and four others headed into the playoff in a straight shootout for the final two spots. A nail-biting war of attrition ensued, with Bienz driving brilliantly to keep himself among the three players that headed to the eighth playoff hole. Having almost holed out with his approach, Bienz tapped in from a few feet away to clinch his place in a field that will fight for its share of a $9.2 million prize purse \u2013 not that he can recall the moment itself. \u201cI don\u2019t remember hitting the putt,\u201d Bienz added to the PGA Tour. \u201cI know that sounds really crazy, but I don\u2019t remember hitting the putt on 18 in regulation either to make birdie. Once it hit, I was like, \u2018This is surreal.\u2019\u201d Once he has figured out what he is going to wear at Detroit Golf Club on Thursday, Bienz will turn his focus to taking on some of the PGA Tour\u2019s biggest names, including South Korea\u2019s rising star Tom Kim, who was narrowly beaten by rampant world No.1 Scottie Scheffler in a playoff at last week\u2019s Travelers Championship. \u201cNo matter what happens \u2013 if I shoot 80-80 the first round and I miss the cut \u2013 at least I can hold my head up high and say, \u2018You finally did it, you finally got into one,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid to say it\u2019s all gravy because, obviously, if you want to play professionally, you can\u2019t just get to the PGA Tour, you have to play well on the PGA Tour.\u201d Then there is the prospect of viral fame to wrestle with, with French\u2019s coverage of Bienz\u2019s heroics capturing the imagination of fans and players alike. \u201cPair him with me,\u201d four-time PGA Tour champion Kevin Kisner \u2013 also in action Thursday \u2013 demanded of the PGA Tour in a post on X, while a Venmo link for Bienz shared by French has drawn in a flurry of payments, including $500 from Ohio-based Garage Beer. \u201cI Facetimed my fianc\u00e9e in the cart on the way back and she was sobbing, couldn\u2019t get words out \u2026 The first thing she said to me she was like, \u2018You\u2019re famous,\u201d Bienz added to the PGA Tour. \u201c\u2019I was like, \u2018What does that even mean, it\u2019s a Monday qualifier?\u2019 She couldn\u2019t get many words out, but she was like, \u2018I\u2019m proud of you.\u2019\u201d Before he left the course, Bienz reconvened with French for a final debrief. \u201cI have to call my boss and call off work tomorrow for sure,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be there 7:30 in the morning and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/sport/nick-bienz-pga-tour-beer-qualifier-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Despite undergoing surgery for a torn meniscus less than a month ago, the 37-year-old Djokovic is back at Wimbledon, winning his first-round match against Vit\u00a0Kop\u0159iva in straight sets \u2013\u00a06-1 6-2 6-2 \u2013 on Tuesday. On June 3, Djokovic battled to a five-set win in the fourth round of the French Open against Francisco Cerundolo, before withdrawing from Roland Garros the following day citing a medial meniscus tear in his right knee. On June 6, Djokovic posted on social media that \u201csurgery went well\u201d and that he\u2019d work to return to the court \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d \u201cEverything I could possibly do, I\u2019ve done along with my team in the last three and a half weeks in order to give myself a chance to be able to play in front of you here today,\u201d Djokovic said in his on-court interview. \u201cI think if it was for any other tournament, I probably wouldn\u2019t risk it, wouldn\u2019t rush it as much. I just love Wimbledon, love coming back here.\u201d There was little sign of the injury hampering Djokovic on Tuesday as he dominated Kop\u0159iva from the first point, dropping just five games and wrapping the match up in less than two hours on court. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how everything is going to unfold on the court,\u201d Djokovic added. \u201cYou know, practice sessions are quite different than official match play. I\u2019m just extremely glad that the way I felt today, the way I played.\u201d Djokovic is seeking his 25th grand slam singles title \u2013 the most across men\u2019s or women\u2019s tennis. He has seven Wimbledon titles, one behind Roger Federer for the most on the men\u2019s side \u2013 Martina Navratilova won the event nine times. Djokovic lost in the final last year to Carlos Alcaraz in a five-set epic. Olympic dreams Following Wimbledon, Djokovic will chase one of the only accolades to elude him: an Olympic gold medal. The 37-year-old will represent Serbia at the upcoming Paris Olympics, the country\u2019s Olympic Committee announced June 18. His best Olympic result is the bronze he won in 2008. \u201cBeing part of the Olympic Games, representing your country, is a huge privilege and honor,\u201d Djokovic, who carried the Serbian flag at the opening ceremony of London 2012, told the ITF in May. \u201c[It\u2019s so special to be] part of the oldest sports event in the history of sport. \u201cOf course, winning a gold medal or winning any medal for my country is a great wish and desire.

Dynastic hot dog eating champion Joey Chestnut was not competing, of course, after the 16-time winner struck a deal with plant-based food company Impossible Foods. Bertoletti pulled ahead in the closing minutes to win with 58 hot dogs, after one of the closest races in recent years. Nathan\u2019s Famous competition got underway in historic fashion with the women\u2019s contest as reigning champion Miki Sudo broke a women\u2019s record by eating 51 hot dogs and buns. She beat second place Mayoi Ebihara by 14 hot dogs and buns to secure her 10th title at the contest. \u201cWe finally beat 50, guys,\u201d Sudo told ESPN after her historic performance. \u201cI\u2019ll see you next year.\u201d Bertoletti bested Geoffrey Esper (53) and James Webb (52), who rounded out the top three. This was Bertoletti\u2019s first title in his ninth career appearance, according to the ESPN2 broadcast. But there was a Chestnut-shaped hole in this year\u2019s event. The maestro of mastication has won the \u201cMustard Yellow Belt\u201d 16 times, and ate a world record 76 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes in 2021. If Chestnut was absent from Nathan\u2019s Famous contest, he wasn\u2019t going to allow Independence Day to pass by without taking on a food challenge. The 40-year-old competed in his own live-streamed showcase event, taking on four US Army soldiers at the Fort Bliss base in El Paso, Texas, in an \u201call-beef\u201d hot dog eating event that raised money for military families. Chestnut devoured 57 hot dogs in five minutes while the soldiers he competed against maxed out at a combined 49. \u201cHot dogs on the Fourth of July in front of people who are celebrating America \u2013 it doesn\u2019t get any better than this,\u201d Chestnut said with a championship belt along his shoulder. With 106 total hot dogs eaten, $106,000 was raised and donated to military families. Chestnut had reportedly said he hoped to eat more hotdogs in five minutes than the winner of Nathan\u2019s competition does in 10 minutes. \u201cI think 56 is doable,\u2019\u2019 he had said, per USA Today. \u201cI\u2019d be very happy to do that.\u2019\u2019 What about next year? The Major League Eating (MLE) organization, which oversees the world-renowned event, has emphasized that Chestnut is not banned for life from competing, citing his 20-year relationship with the league. The organization said that, to come back, Chestnut must renounce deals with brands that rival Nathan\u2019s. \u201cJoey Chestnut is an American hero. We would love nothing more than to have him at Nathan\u2019s Famous International Hot Dog Eating Contest, which he has dominated for years. We hope that he returns when he is not representing a rival brand,\u201d MLE said in a statement. An account under Chestnut\u2019s name posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, Tuesday that he does \u201cnot have a contract with MLE or Nathans and they are looking to change the rules from past years as it relates to other partners I can work with.\u201d CNN has not independently confirmed the authenticity of the X account.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/sport/nathans-famous-hot-dog-eating-contest-joey-chestnut-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_sport_ukraine-athletes-paris-olympics-spt-intl", "text": "Kateryna Tabashnyk couldn\u2019t hold back her tears \u2013 not necessarily because her attempt to qualify for her first Olympics had fallen short, but because she was now reflecting on all the grief and pain of the past two-and-a-half years. The 30-year-old high jumper cleared 1.89 meters at the Ukrainian Athletics Championships on Sunday, not enough to qualify for this year\u2019s Olympic Games in Paris. But the fact that she had even come so close was a testament to her remarkable willpower and perseverance. Tabashnyk\u2019s mother was killed in a Russian airstrike on Kharkiv two years ago. She had stayed in the eastern city to help her young nephew, who was seriously injured in an earlier attack by Russian forces. Tabashnyk decided to return to competition a month later, viewing sport as a means to honor her mother\u2019s life even in the depths of grief. \u201cOf course, it affects people and, of course, me \u2013 the loss of my home, the loss of my dear mother, the loss of friends,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cAll this takes strength, takes energy. It\u2019s like a poison for the body.\u201d \u201cWe have to prepare to compete and show results against this background. Of course, it\u2019s very hard, it\u2019s very difficult, but to be honest, I don\u2019t know where I\u2019ve been getting this energy, this strength for the last two years. It\u2019s something incredible, even for me.\u201d Ukraine will send a team of more than 100 athletes to Paris, and \u2013 though that\u2019s fewer than the country had in Tokyo three years ago \u2013 their participation will likely feel more significant. The Ukrainian athletes competing at the games have endured a myriad of challenges since Russia\u2019s invasion, including facilities being destroyed, friends and relatives being killed and uncertainty about what the future might hold. According to Ukraine\u2019s Sports Ministry, about 3,000 athletes \u2013 from Olympic and non-Olympic sports \u2013 have served for the country\u2019s military, either voluntarily or by being drafted, and 479 have been killed while serving or in civilian life. More than 500 sports facilities have been destroyed, including 15 Olympic training bases. Tabashnyk won bronze at the European Indoor Championships earlier this year \u2013 her first medal at a major event \u2013 and was hoping to be part of Ukraine\u2019s first Olympic team since Russia launched its full-scale invasion with the support of Belarus in February 2022. She had been confident of making the team before a recent injury hampered her preparation for the national championships in Lviv. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how many times I wanted to give it all up, give up on sports, on jumping,\u201d Tabashnyk said. \u201cBut every time I pull myself together and say, \u2018No, now I have to fight like never before.\u2019 And so it goes every time, no matter what obstacle stands in my way.\u201d She is far from the only Ukrainian athlete whose life has been scarred by Russia\u2019s invasion of their country. Many athletes have moved abroad in order to continue their careers and train for this year\u2019s Games. That includes 400-meter hurdler Viktoriia Tkachuk, who has become accustomed to undertaking the 46-hour trip from Ukraine to her training camp in South Africa. Tkachuk\u2019s brother was called up to the frontline in May last year, and since then, her whole family has been fraught with fear about his safety. \u201cWe were all stressed out because we were thinking, \u2018Oh, no, he\u2019s not ready yet, he cannot go there,\u2019\u201d the 29-year-old told CNN. \u201cBut we were doing our best to support him, because if he\u2019s worrying, then he will feel our worries and it will not help him.\u201d Tkachuk saw her brother in February when he had a break from military service, and the pair are in regular contact while they go about their separate lives. \u201cHe\u2019s texted me a message: \u2018You will win there, and I will win here,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cSomething like this. \u2026 He has in his pocket \u2013 close to his heart \u2013 small pictures with us together, our family, and he said this picture is always with him. It\u2019s nice to know this.\u201d Having already qualified for the Olympics, a minor injury prevented Tkachuk from competing in Lviv, where CNN spoke to several athletes looking to secure a spot on the team. Despite Russia\u2019s invasion casting a long shadow over Ukraine\u2019s participation at these Olympics, there was a vibrant atmosphere at the event, and most athletes were excited by the chance to compete for an Olympic berth. \u201cNow, with a big team under our flag, we take part in a big Olympic movement, we take part in the biggest contest, and the entire world is looking at us,\u201d Matviy Bidnyi, Ukraine\u2019s acting sports minister, told CNN. \u201cAll of the world awaits what we will do in the Olympic Games, what we can show in the Olympic Games \u2013 that our country, which is in a condition of war now, is in a good shape.\u201d \u201cThis is a very important mission,\u201d he added, \u201cand all our athletes understand their responsibility in it.\u201d Whether Russian and Belarusian athletes should be permitted to compete at this year\u2019s Olympics, which begin on July 26, has been the topic of intense debate, especially for Ukrainian athletes and officials. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has said that Russian and Belarusians can compete as Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs) in Paris, provided that they meet certain eligibility requirements. This means that teams of Russian and Belarusian athletes will not be considered, while athletes who actively support the war against Ukraine will also be ineligible. No reference to either country will be made at the Games through the athletes\u2019 participation, such as flags, anthems or national colors. The IOC ruled that it would be unfair to punish athletes based on their passports alone, but many people in Ukraine were hoping for a more stringent stance. \u201cWe think that this position is strong enough,\u201d said Bidnyi, \u201cbut we think it would be better if they were banned totally.\u201d There will be no Russians or Belarusians taking part in track and field events in Paris as governing body World Athletics has banned athletes from these two countries from competing at an elite level \u2013 the only Olympic sports federation to have done so. This means that athletes like Tkachuk will avoid the potentially challenging situation of lining up against competitors whose nations are at war with her country, irrespective of how they are presented at the Games. \u201cThis is really nice to know, for my brother also, that I\u2019m not going to competitions to run with Russians, or to speak with Russians, or to deal with something that I don\u2019t need,\u201d she said. Her teammate, fellow 400m hurdler Anna Ryzhykova, agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re not friends, we\u2019re not competitors,\u201d Ryzhykova told CNN about facing Russian and Belarusian athletes. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a right to be at the Olympics \u2026 because every one [of them] is guilty in some way.\u201d Like Tkachuk, Ryzhykova has had to spend time away from Ukraine while she trains and competes, basing herself in the Italian city of Brescia during the summer months. But being away from her family home in Dnipro isn\u2019t always easy. \u201cHome is my safe place where I can recharge, relax, where I feel good, where I can really rest between competitions or in my training life,\u201d says the 34-year-old, a 4x400m relay bronze medalist at the 2012 London Olympics. \u201cIn the training camps, it\u2019s totally different in other countries; it\u2019s good, some countries are really amazing, but it\u2019s not my native (country). I can\u2019t relax fully there.\u201d Ryzhykova has learned not to read the news on the days she has a competition, which means finding different ways to distract herself whenever thoughts of the war enter her mind. \u201cI use books, novels or something easier,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I have bad thoughts, I\u2019m going back to this novel, and [thinking], OK, what is my character doing? I need to concentrate on this. It\u2019s my plan for competition day.\u201d CNN\u2019s Svitlana Vlasova contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/sport/ukraine-athletes-paris-olympics-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "sports"}}

The Fever star reached the historic stat line with just over seven minutes left in the fourth quarter, as the 22-year-old came down with a defensive rebound on a Kayla Thornton miss. Clark finished with 19 points, 13 assists and 12 rebounds, for the first triple-double in Fever history. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s really cool. I mean my teammates have been finishing the ball really, really at a high rate, my assists numbers is because of them,\u201d Clark said after the game. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m just happy we won. I take a lot of pride of being able to do a lot of different things for this team.\u201d After having lost their first three meetings with the WNBA\u2019s best Liberty, the Fever overcame an 11-point deficit early in the fourth quarter, going on an 11-0 run late to steal the victory at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis. Clark\u2019s latest accomplishment comes a day after Chicago Sky rookie Angel Reese extended her single-season record for double-doubles to 12. The former LSU star\u2019s 12 consecutive double-doubles matched the all-time record set by all-time WNBA great Candace Parker, who achieved the feat across the 2009 and 2010 seasons. Having competed against each other in many memorable contests through their collegiate and early WNBA careers, Clark and Reese\u2019s latest battle is for Rookie of the Year honors, with both being the clear-cut front runners. Reese and Clark were both recently named WNBA All-Stars. It\u2019s the first time two rookies are WNBA All-Stars in the same season since 2014. \u201cI\u2019m always going to make a case for my players,\u201d Fever head coach Christie Sides said of Clark after the game. \u201cFirst and foremost, she is the most competitive human being I\u2019ve ever met. I really compare her to Diana Tuarasi. She\u2019s always looking to find ways to get better. \u201cShe just wants to win; she just wants to win. She\u2019s going to be my rookie of the year, every day.\u201d Reese was named WNBA Rookie of the Month for June. Clark, meanwhile, was named Rookie of the Month in May. Team WNBA will take on the USA Basketball Women\u2019s National Team at the Footprint Center in Phoenix for a sold-out game on July 20. Clark has consistently drawn huge crowds during her time in the WNBA. On Tuesday, 20,366 watched her Fever lose 88-69 against the Las Vegas Aces, the fifth-biggest crowd in league history and largest since 1999. The Fever are currently the No. 8 seed in the playoff race, sitting half-a-game behind Reese\u2019s Chicago Sky for the seventh spot.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/sport/caitlin-clark-wnba-triple-double-record-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "sports"}}

A two-time Olympic champion, Coe is also a member of the International Olympic Committee. But he\u2019s at odds with the IOC when it comes to their stance on Russian athletes. Following Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine \u2013 supported by Belarus \u2013 in February 2022, World Athletics is the only Olympic sports federation to have banned all Russian and Belarussian athletes from elite competition. The IOC, on the other hand, has allowed dozens of athletes from those two countries to compete as neutrals at this month\u2019s Paris Games. Zelensky has said \u201cthere is no such thing as neutrality when a war like this is going on,\u201d and that \u201cany neutral flag of Russian athletes is stained with blood.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s road to the Olympics has been riddled with obstacles. According to the country\u2019s Sports Ministry, more than 500 sports facilities have been destroyed in Russian attacks. Hundreds of athletes have been killed, and many others forced to train abroad. In the meeting with the Ukrainian president, World Athletics committed to keep providing financial support for the country\u2019s athletes. They also discussed other initiatives, including the creation of a program that would support 18- to 22-year-old competitors and their coaches, so they can continue to compete in athletics at an international level. Coe also stopped by the Ukrainian Athletics Championships in Lviv, the event that determined which athletes will compete in the Olympics. \u201cYou are an absolute inspiration,\u201d he told a group of athletes who gathered to meet him. Before leaving the country, a visibly emotional Coe recalled arriving in Kyiv in the early morning alongside a medical train with civilian casualties from the front line. \u201cAnd leaving Kyiv last night, and witnessing the night train coming in, in exactly the same way and just looking at parents and brothers, sisters \u2026 It was a sobering, sobering moment,\u201d he told CNN. As to whether Zelensky accepted his invitation to go to the Games, Coe said he \u201cwasn\u2019t sure whether his diary was going to allow him to do that.

The seven-time world champion rolled back the years to take his first race win since the 2021 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix and a record-extending ninth victory at Silverstone, prompting delirious celebrations from the packed home crowd as a tearful Hamilton paraded around the track, holding the Union Jack aloft from his car. And it was his old rival, Max Verstappen, who Hamilton fought off to secure the win as the Red Bull driver chipped away at the Briton\u2019s lead in a dramatic finish, but was unable to overtake him. For Hamilton to win his last British Grand Prix with Mercedes \u2013 the team with whom he dominated the sport for so long \u2013 seemed like a \u201cfairytale,\u201d team principal Toto Wolff told broadcaster Sky Sports after the race. No other driver has won as many races at the same circuit as Hamilton has at Silverstone now, further cementing the 39-year-old\u2019s legacy at the track and as the sport\u2019s most successful ever driver. Hamilton himself seemed overwhelmed by emotion too, embracing his father at the finish and telling Sky Sports that he \u201ccan\u2019t stop crying.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been since 2021, just everyday getting up trying to fight, to train, to put my mind to the task and work as hard as I can with this amazing team,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is my last race here at the British Grand Prix with this team, so I wanted to win this so much for them. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely been days between 2021 and here where I didn\u2019t feel like I was good enough or whether I was going to get back to where I am today but the important thing is I had great people around me continuing to support me,\u201d he added. Hopes were high among the home crowd for a British winner at the race since there was a British 1-2-3 starting on the grid at Silverstone for the first time since 1962. George Russell began on pole, ahead of his teammate Hamilton in second and McLaren\u2019s Lando Norris in third, and Russell held the lead for the first third of the race until Hamilton streaked past his teammate. But both Mercedes cars ran wide off the track across the run-off shortly afterwards, allowing Norris to overtake Russell and then to accelerate past Hamilton too. As the rain poured down at Silverstone, Norris seemed assured in the lead but Hamilton began slowly reeling him in while Russell was forced to retire from the race with a technical issue and Verstappen started chasing the leaders down. Once the rain cleared, the drivers pitted to change their tires again and Norris slightly misjudged his mark, adding an extra couple of seconds to his stop, and Hamilton capitalized to take the lead. There was still drama to come in the closing laps of the race as Verstappen overtook Norris to take second and began chasing down Hamilton but ultimately ran out of road.

But world No. 35 Putintseva rallied and dropped just three games in the next two sets to seal a 3-6 6-1 6-2 victory. Afterwards, \u015awi\u0105tek admitted that she knows \u201cwhat I need to change\u201d for her Wimbledon preparations after another underwhelming tournament where her best result still remains reaching the quarterfinals in 2023. \u201cMy tank of really pushing myself to the limits became suddenly empty,\u201d she told reporters, per Reuters. \u201cI was kind of surprised.

Her opponent Putintseva, meanwhile, has enjoyed an undefeated grass court season, won her first title on the surface in Birmingham last month and has now reached the fourth round at Wimbledon for the first ever time. Glimpses of Putintseva\u2019s skill on grass began flickering in the first set as she produced shots like a perfectly judged backhand crosscourt passing shot that frustrated \u015awi\u0105tek or a delicate slice return winner to save set point. And though \u015awi\u0105tek proved too powerful in the first set, Putintseva continued to break down the Pole\u2019s game and stormed through the second to level the match. In the third set, she remained consistent and resolute while \u015awi\u0105tek produced several uncharacteristic unforced errors, accumulating 38 by the end compared to Putintseva\u2019s 15. \u201cAt some point I was playing fearless,\u201d Putintseva told reporters afterwards. \u201cI was just, I can do it, I have to believe 100 percent, I have nothing to lose, just go for it. Also my coach told me, no matter which shot you\u2019re doing, believe 100 percent and just follow.\u201d She will now face Jelena Ostapenko on Monday for a place in the quarterfinals.

Emma Navarro is quickly establishing herself as a force to be reckoned with on the senior tour, with the 23-year-old reaching the quarterfinals at this year\u2019s Wimbledon. As if to underline her credentials, Navarro beat reigning US Open champion Coco Gauff in straight sets \u2013 6-4 6-3 \u2013 in the fourth round on Sunday to continue her best run at a grand slam. \u201cI don\u2019t have a ton of words but just really grateful to be out here on Center Court at a tournament with so much history and tradition, that so many legends have played on before me,\u201d Navarro said during her post-match interview after beating Gauff. \u201cIt\u2019s a real honor. I can\u2019t wait to play again.\u201d Navarro\u2019s form at this year\u2019s Wimbledon follows what has already been an impressive season for the youngster. The American reached the third round of the Australian Open earlier this year, before progressing to the fourth round at the French Open. According to the WTA, she has won 33 tour-level matches in 2024, more than twice as many as she won last year, while $1,074,546 of her $1,847,241 in career prize money has been won in 2024 alone. She claimed her first WTA title at the Hobart International in January and has risen from 149th in the world at the start of last season to her current position as world No. 17, \u201cI think that mindset has definitely helped me just not to look at a day like today as any different than any other match,\u201d she said, per WTA, explaining her rise after reaching the quarterfinals.  \u201cI think just being able to look at individual matches for what they are and not make them anything greater than that.\u201d While her rise through the ranks has been rapid, it perhaps shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. Navarro enjoyed a successful college career at Virginia, becoming the 2021 NCAA champion in her freshman year \u2013 a result which then qualified her for the US Open main draw, where she lost in the first round. She decided to turn her full attention to professional tennis in 2022, finishing her college career with a record of 51-3 in singles matches. Billionaire heiress Just like compatriot Jessica Pegula, Navarro is the daughter of a billionaire. Her father Ben Navarro is founder and CEO of Sherman Financial Group and is valued by Forbes as being worth $1.5 billion. He has also invested heavily in tennis. In 2022, he paid nearly $300 million to buy the Cincinnati Open \u2013 a warmup event for the US Open every year. In an interview with the Tennis Channel earlier this season, Navarro credited her calm demeanour and mindset to her dad. \u201cHe\u2019s probably the smartest guy I know and he\u2019s dropped a lot of knowledge and wisdom on my siblings and I over the years,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s taught me a bunch about the perspective I want to take into things, especially on-court stuff.\u201d Despite being set to inherit a fortune, Navarro looks determined to make her own name and has a chance to do exactly that at this year\u2019s Wimbledon.

So it\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d The 25-year-old rookie got the Yankees off to the ideal start when he launched a huge solo home run to right field at the bottom of the first inning. \u201cWhat a game and obviously in the midst of what we\u2019re going through to come out and set the tone right away in the first inning with a homer and then put together a kind of legendary day,\u201d New York Yankees manager Aaron Boone told reporters postgame of Rice\u2019s big day. \u201cJust really big time.\u201d In the bottom of the fifth, Rice went even bigger with a three-run home run to give the Yankees a 10-4 lead.

{"id": "2024_07_04_sport_jesse-owens-grandson-1936-olympics-berlin-spt-intl", "text": "American Jesse Owens\u2019 achievements at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin \u2013 he won four gold medals in the 100 meters, the 200m, the 4x100m relay and the long jump \u2013 made him a track and field great. Those achievements came under the gaze of Adolf Hitler, who had initially planned for the Olympics held in Nazi Germany to showcase what he believed to be the racial superiority of\u00a0White, so-called \u201cAryan\u201d\u00a0athletes, openly denigrating Black American participants as \u201cnon-humans.\u201d The image of Owens \u2013 one of 18 Black athletes on the US team \u2013 atop the podium and surrounded by individuals giving the Nazi salute\u00a0has become part of Olympic lore. Owens\u2019 grandson Stuart Owen Rankin describes the track and field great\u2019s actions as a \u201cthumb in the eye\u201d to Hitler. \u201cMy grandfather\u2019s legacy continues to prosper. When people do find out and it\u2019s not often that I discuss it outwardly, but people do eventually find out, for example, perhaps through watching interviews like this, their response is always positive,\u201d Rankin told CNN\u2019s Don Riddell. \u201cTheir response is one that fills me with pride. Again, their response speaks to my grandfather\u2019s accomplishments and the enduring quality of what he did in \u201836 and sort of the timelessness of those accomplishments.\u201d \u2018A bond, a brotherhood, a connection\u2019 Another enduring memory from the 1936 Games was Owens\u2019\u00a0connection with the German long-jumper Luz Long. Owens and Long were seen as the two favorites to compete for the gold medal in the long jump at the Berlin Games. The two men came from very different backgrounds. Owens was a Black American and Long was a White German living in Nazi Germany. Given the circumstances of the 1936 Olympics, a level of hostility might have been expected between the long jumpers. In fact, the opposite was true. According to Rankin,\u00a0Owens said Long offered him advice\u00a0on how to not overstep, which was an issue the US athlete was having in the long jump qualifying competition. Following Long\u2019s advice, Owens\u00a0said he\u00a0put down a towel at a mark to help him perfect his run-up and in doing so, the American was able to successfully book his spot in the long-jump final. Owens went on to claim gold, while Long secured the silver. \u201cIt took a lot of courage for [Long] to befriend me in front of Hitler,\u201d Owens later said of his friendship with Long. \u201cYou can melt down all the medals and cups I have and they wouldn\u2019t be a plating on the 24-carat friendship I felt for Long at that moment.\u201d Rankin says the two became \u201ccomrades, became allies, became friends\u201d by pushing themselves to greater heights. \u201cWhat came from that was a bond, a brotherhood, a connection between two world class athletes on the highest stage of their particular event or sport.\u201d Long was killed fighting for Nazi Germany in World War II, but the families of the Americn and German still remain in contact, bonded through their grandfathers\u2019 friendship, according to Rankin. Owens\u2019 grandson recalls traveling to Munich for business and a colleague, upon finding out who his grandfather was, asked if he knew who Long was. Once they had established that he did, Rankin\u2019s colleague scrolled through his contacts\u2019 list and found the name Julia Long,\u00a0the German long jumper\u2019s granddaughter. Through that connection, Rankin and Long\u2019s granddaughter met for dinner, an evening he describes as a \u201cvery special meal, a very special conversation.\u201d \u201cWe both spoke to what it was like to be the grandchild of an Olympian, particularly an Olympian from those Games and particularly our respective grandfathers and only Julia could speak to what it\u2019s like in a way that\u2019s similar to how I could speak to what it\u2019s like,\u201d remembers Rankin. \u201cAnd so, we of course bonded over that. We talked about our personal interests that are likely to have been influenced by our grandfathers, our interests in outdoors and physicality and sports. So it was, it was a very special time and a very special conversation and the connection continues on today.\u201d Strides After the Berlin Games,\u00a0widespread, institutionalized racism and segregation in the US\u00a0meant Owens\u2019\u00a0achievements weren\u2019t fully appreciated\u00a0when he returned home. Although the then-22-year-old Owens did receive a New York ticker tape parade, he was forced to ride in a freight elevator to a reception in his honor at the Waldorf Astoria\u00a0hotel. \u201cAlthough I wasn\u2019t invited to shake hands with Hitler,\u201d Owens said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t invited to the White House to shake hands with the President, either.\u201d Owens also failed to attract the endorsements and sponsorship deals enjoyed by White athletes, and was reduced to running exhibition races against\u00a0motorbikes and\u00a0horses to make ends meet. It was not until the 1950s, 20 years after his Berlin triumph, that he finally achieved a measure of financial security, opening a public relations firm and becoming a highly successful public speaker. Owens later received the two highest civilian honors the US can bestow. In 1976, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Gerald Ford,\u00a0and in 1990, a decade after his death from lung cancer, President George\u00a0H.W.\u00a0Bush\u00a0presented his widow\u00a0a posthumous Congressional\u00a0Gold Medal. In perhaps the most fitting memorial to his achievements, a street in Berlin was renamed in his honor in 1984. Asked what the reception would be for Owens upon his return to the US had he achieved his feats in 2024, Rankin\u00a0says\u00a0his grandfather would \u201crecognize \u2026 almost immeasurable strides in progress in terms of race relations here within the United States.\u201d However, Rankin added that there are \u201cstill people, many people, people in power, people in positions of authority that hold onto that mindset of 1930s America. \u201cAnd I think that it would not be lost on him, that we still have a long way to go when it comes to many people\u2019s mindsets towards people who are different from them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/sport/jesse-owens-grandson-1936-olympics-berlin-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "sports"}}

The 25-year-old is no stranger to the physical demands of training but for the first Olympics since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the one-time bronze medal winner is upping her mental game in anticipation of squaring off against Russian athletes. \u201cI consider it my mission to prevent them from getting on the podium,\u201d Kolyadenko told CNN. \u201cIf I show my emotions, demonstrate them, it will prevent me from winning \u2026 but, of course, there will be no handshakes,\u201d she said. Russians and Belarusians will be participating in the games as Individual Neutral Athletes and that means Ukrainian athletes could end up facing off against them. Ukraine\u2019s sports ministry has issued guidelines for their athletes competing at the upcoming Games in Paris including refraining from joint photos, press conferences, and events with Russian and Belarusian athletes, not commenting on social media, keeping a distance from them during award ceremonies, and much more. Acting Sports Minister Matviy Bidnyi told CNN that the reason for the recommendations was several incidents that have already occurred at competitions of various levels ahead of the Olympics, including the refusal to shake hands with a Russian athlete at the world championships, which resulted in disqualification for fencer Olga Kharlan. According to the Ukrainian Ministry of Sport, discussions were held with international federations in various sports over its athletes not wanting to shake hands with Russian and Belarusian athletes at the Paris Olympics. As a result, the international federations decided that Ukrainian athletes wouldn\u2019t be disqualified for not shaking hands with individual neutral athletes. For Kolyadenko, shaking hands with Russian and Belarusian athletes is a no-go. \u201cThe Russian military destroyed my apartment, the Russian military is destroying my life, the lives of my family and the whole country, how can I treat them? Of course, negatively. I don\u2019t want Russians to take part in the competition at all. This is unacceptable,\u201d she said. When Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Kolyadenko was at the gym in Kyiv where she now is training for the Paris Games. \u201cThat day, we were supposed to fly to Turkey for a competition, but at 4 a.m. we woke up hearing explosions. Of course, I was totally confused and didn\u2019t know what to do. \u201cBut then I gathered my thoughts, packed my things and went to Irpin \u2026 At that time, I did not understand what had happened,\u201d adds Kolyadenko as she recalled traveling to Dymtrivka village to be with her grandmother, aunt and sister. Three days later, she says, dozens of Russian military vehicles entered Irpin. Residential areas were shelled, and civilians were killed. The village where Kolyadenko and her family were staying, was under constant shelling. The family moved to the basement. One day, when Kolyadenko went upstairs to get her stuff, she says, the wrestler saw through her window there were Russian troops rappelling down a ladder from a helicopter. Running out of food, and with no water or gas, and no medicines being delivered and little prospect of evacuation, Kolyadenko and her relatives left the village \u201cIt was already very dangerous,\u201d said Kolyadenko. \u201cOn the roadsides there were shot up cars where people had been killed.\u201d Kolyadenko spent more than a day driving with her family and relatives. She says she didn\u2019t think about sports or training at all, because she didn\u2019t know if they would survive. \u2018We had no choice.. because our families were there\u2019 Kolyadenko was not the only one to experience such a life-threatening situation. The head coach of the women\u2019s wrestling team, Volodymyr Evonov, also encountered Russian troops at the base near Kyiv. Almost immediately, he left for his family in Kherson, even though there was already information that convoys of Russian heavy vehicles were heading towards the city from annexed Crimea. \u201cWe traveled to meet the war. We had no choice. On the way, we saw our military digging trenches. They told us not to go there. We went anyway. Because our families were there,\u201d Evonov told CNN as he recalled those first days of invasion. A week later, the Russians entered Kherson. Local residents resisted them, took to the streets with posters and flags to stop Russian tanks, and organized pro-Ukrainian rallies in the city\u2019s central square until repression began against the activists. The athletes had their own form of protest \u2013 they continued to train. \u201cWe trained regularly and waited for our military to release us,\u201d added Evonov. \u201cA month passed in this expectation. It was getting harder and harder. We got together with our coaches, took some of the athletes and our families and in mid-April (2022) we took advantage of the window of opportunity and managed to leave.\u201d After Evonov and his colleagues left their hometown, Kherson remained under occupation until the city was liberated in 2022, though it remains under constant shelling. It is no longer possible to continue training there, according to Evonov. Just a month after the war began, the women\u2019s national wrestling team was able to gather for a joint training session at the Olympic center of the Hungarian team in Tata. The Ukraine women\u2019s team was then invited to live and train in a safe environment by their Japanese colleagues, where they spent a fortnight in June 2023. The Ukraine women\u2019s team also spent another two months in the US, where they were hosted by local universities. These days, the women have returned to regular training at their base near Kyiv. They have endured blackouts caused by Russian targeting of electricity infrastructure and spent sleepless nights as missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles hit the city. While Kyiv is much better protected these days the war shows no sign of ending. Difficult training conditions The conditions under which the athletes have prepared for the Paris Olympics affected the team\u2019s results. At the Tokyo Olympics, the women\u2019s wrestling team won five licenses. This year, only two athletes \u2013 Kolyadenko and Oksana Livach \u2013 will go to Paris. According to Bidnyi, more than 100 athletes will represent the Ukrainian national team in Paris. Given the conditions in which they have been preparing for the Olympics over the past two years, the Ministry of Sports of Ukraine says this number of athletes competing is quite positive given that there is a war going on. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that during the aggression, when, for example, Russia caused a blackout last winter, it was very difficult to train,\u201d said Bidnyi. \u201cThe temperature in the halls sometimes dropped so much that we had to train in our outerwear. Another example is that our synchronized swimmers train in a pool in Kharkiv, which actually has a hole in the roof because a missile hit it. It is clear that these are not the conditions that can be called normal,\u201d added Bidnyi. Over 500 sports infrastructure facilities have been destroyed since the full-scale invasion, according to Bidnyi. These are the ones located on the territory controlled by Ukraine. There is no verified information about the destroyed infrastructure facilities in the occupied part. \u201cThere are athletes whose loved ones and parents are at constant risk,\u201d said Bidnyi. \u201cSomeone\u2019s relatives are serving on the frontline today, and the athletes are worried about them. \u201cSome of our athletes have lost their parents, who lived a peaceful life until a missile hit their home. There are a lot of such stories. Some lost their homes, some lost their loved ones,\u201d adds Bidnyi. For Kolyadenko, getting a license and preparing for the Paris Olympics was more difficult than for any other competition in her career. Given the uncertainty in Ukraine, she says she cannot plan her professional life after the Olympics. For now, here only goal is do her country proud.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/sport/ukraine-russia-olympics-iryna-kolyadenko-intl-spt/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Navarro needed just 59 minutes to ease past four-time grand slam champion Osaka, who recorded her first win at Wimbledon since 2018 against Diana Parry in the first round. Now ranked No. 113 in the world, Osaka was competing as a wildcard at Wimbledon this year.\u00a0The Japanese star\u00a0returned to tennis\u00a0at the start of 2024 after more than a year away from the sport prioritizing her mental health and then\u00a0becoming a mother. Osaka, who has won all four of her grand slam titles on hard courts, still hasn\u2019t been past the third round at Wimbledon. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was the greatest from my end,\u201d Osaka said, per PA. \u201cI feel like even though in the beginning it was kind of like we were trading games, I don\u2019t know why, I didn\u2019t feel fully confident in myself. I didn\u2019t feel like I was playing that well. \u201cI guess those doubts started trickling in a lot into my game. Obviously the second set wasn\u2019t that great. I don\u2019t know why those thoughts were so prevalent. \u201cI\u2019m a little disappointed because I wanted to do really well. I feel like I put a lot of time into it. There\u2019s always next year.\u201d While Osaka\u2019s grass court season is over, the 26-year-old has shown enough form throughout the year to suggest she could be a real threat on the hard courts again. Navarro, the 2021 NCAA champion, has enjoyed a breakout year on the tour and has now reached at least the third round of all three grand slams this season. The 23-year-old was ranked 149th in the world at the start of last season but has now soared to the world No. 17 position and looks a real threat in SW19 after reaching the semfinals of the Bad Homburg Open in the lead up to Wimbledon. \u201cIt\u2019s my first time on Centre Court. It doesn\u2019t really seem to be real,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cI\u2019ve been having a lot of fun on grass. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of been the theme of my time on tour so far, just trying to really enjoy myself \u2013 and today was no exception. So I\u2019m just having a lot of fun and it was a really special atmosphere.\u201d Navarro will face Diana Shnaider in the third round after the Russian 20-year-old breezed past former US Open champion Sloane Stephens in straight sets, winning 6-1 6-1.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/sport/naomi-osaka-wimbledon-emma-navarro-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_sport_hyrox-meg-jacoby-celia-duff-olympics-spt-intl", "text": "It\u2019s a race that requires a mesmerizing mix of strength and endurance; one that pushes the fittest of the fit to the edge of what they think is possible. And now, after a steady start, the fitness phenomenon that is HYROX has finally found its stride. HYROX is a functional fitness race which involves an eight-kilometer (almost five-mile) run interspersed with eight workout stations. Each station requires participants to perform a different exercise \u2013 SkiErg, sled push, sled pull, burpee broad jumps, rowing, farmer\u2019s carry, sandbag lunges and the dreaded wall balls. Competitors are able to compete in teams, pairs or by themselves. No matter the age or ability, the race format remains the same \u2013 the only difference being the differing weights used at the stations. HYROX\u2019s first iteration in 2017 saw 618 participants, while now it boasts more than 210,000 across 30 cities. CNN recently spoke to two women at the forefront of HYROX\u2019S charge to discover what life is like at the top of the latest fitness craze. Meg Jacoby Meg Jacoby is the newly crowned world champion, demolishing the elite women\u2019s field at the World Championships in Nice, France, in June. The American was the first ever woman to complete a HYROX race in under one hour and only recently saw her solo world record beaten by compatriot Lauren Weeks. After she crossed the finish line, cementing her first world title, Jacoby fell to the floor in an equal measure of exhaustion and jubilation, where she was greeted by her nine-year-old daughter. \u201cMy daughter has sacrificed just as much, if not more, than I have because she\u2019s sacrificing a lot of time away from me so I can do what I need to do and be living my dream as an athlete,\u201d Jacoby tells CNN Sport. \u201cIt felt like it was all worth it. Having her there was just really, really special. She gets to witness so many strong, powerful, incredible women when she gets to watch my races \u2013 not just me.\u201d Jacoby only heard about HYROX in 2022. She signed up for the New York race later that year and started working with HYROX coach Rich Ryan. Despite admitting to some errors during her first race, Jacoby delivered an impressive time in New York. Four weeks later, in only her second race, the American broke the then women\u2019s pro world record in Chicago. \u201cAt that point, I knew I should probably go all in. It was pretty crazy to have that kind of success so quickly, but it seemed like just the right sport for me,\u201d Jacoby tells CNN. Despite somewhat stumbling upon HYROX, Jacoby had unknowingly been preparing for the sport for years. Her competitive streak was evident from an early age, with sports playing a major role in her upbringing \u2013 Jacoby\u2019s brother is also a professional bodybuilder. During college, she was an impressive middle-distance runner and has since competed in long-distance challenges. When a lot of the road races were suspended during the Covid lockdowns, Jacoby then turned her attention to powerlifting. Before discovering HYROX, when people asked Jacoby what she was training for in the gym, her answer was emphatic: \u201cI want to be hard to kill.\u201d Jacoby has now quit her day job to focus fully on being a professional athlete. She runs up to seven times a week and combines endurance sessions with hours in the gym. Jacoby says she trains for two or three sessions per day but is aware that might sound \u201cintimidating\u201d to other people. \u201cYou can have a lot of success in this without having to do that type of volume,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s just kind of where I\u2019m at and what I know works for me and what my body needs.\u201d Jacoby knows the importance of diet and recovery. She aims to sleep at least eight hours every night and fuels her body with a high-carb, high-protein diet. \u201cMy diet is very boring,\u201d she laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of chicken and rice. It\u2019s kind of mundane, but that\u2019s kind of the life of an athlete. It\u2019s repetitive.\u201d Despite being in gladiator-like shape, even Jacoby struggles to describe what a HYROX race feels like. \u201cI think all of us at this level are a little bit crazy,\u201d she says, explaining why she has picked such a grueling sport. \u201cWe have a lot of enjoyment for pain and suffering.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m always discovering more and more about myself as a person, pushing myself to my limits and kind of seeing what I\u2019m made of.\u201d Jacoby says the sense of community is another reason she dedicates her life to HYROX and says she finds inspiration from all corners of the sport \u2013 notably some of the other mothers who balance training with raising a family. She is also aware of another athlete, from London, who is excelling at the other end of the scale \u2013 with a badass moniker to match. The \u2018Badass Gran\u2019 Celia Duff, who is 70, was recently crowned world champion in the 70-74 category \u2013 an accolade to go alongside the 65-69 world title she won last year. She has also been a world record holder twice but is quick to point out that both her records have since been broken. \u201cI have an allotment, I have chickens, I have a dog. I help with the grandchildren, when help is needed, and pick them up from school and so on. I\u2019m very busy doing not a huge amount,\u201d Duff tells CNN Sport, drastically underplaying her quite astonishing achievements on an international stage. Like Jacoby, Duff found the sport of HYROX somewhat by mistake. Duff\u2019s daughter was an early adopter of the phenomenon and one day asked her mom to come along to an event in October 2022. Duff had always kept herself fit \u2013 she was a good rower during her youth and stepped up her fitness routine during the Covid lockdowns. But after agreeing to compete at her first HYROX event, Duff started reading up about the race and quickly realized she was in for a tough day. Incredibly, though, she went on to break the world record for her 65-69 category, in a time which qualified her for the 2023 World Championships in Manchester, England \u2013 a race she also went on to win. Duff says there is only a \u201ctiny\u201d number of people her age competing in HYROX \u2013 perhaps unsurprisingly given the physical toll it has on the body. But for Duff, a retired public health doctor, the sport gives her focus and the training helps her to stay young. The grandmother runs three times a week, mixing up the pace and distance of each session. She also works with a coach for her strength training and spends time practicing the exact movements she is required to do for the HYROX stations. Rest, though, is almost as important, and Duff takes at least a day off per week to allow her body to recover. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly important to keep mobile and strong as you get older because, if you don\u2019t, the rate at which you deteriorate increases,\u201d she says, explaining the \u201cwhy\u201d behind her participation. \u201cI want to be strong and functionally fit. That\u2019s the key to HYROX.\u201d Dubbed the \u201cBadass Gran,\u201d Duff isn\u2019t altogether comfortable with being called an \u201cinspiration\u201d to others, but a brief look through the comments posted on her Instagram demonstrates just how much she is motivating others to get fit. \u201cI\u2019m genuinely humble and grateful,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I can encourage older people or anybody, actually, just to get up and have a go, then great.\u201d Despite her short but impressive career as as HYROX athlete, Duff says it would be \u201cbonkers\u201d for her to continue racing because of the \u201cbody-breaking\u201d work involved. However, she does plan on competing with her daughter in a doubles event later this year and wants to continue being involved with the sport. Olympic aspirations Duff and Jacoby are proof that something is working for HYROX. The business was set up in 2017 by events organizer Christian Toetzke and three-time Olympic hockey medalist Moritz F\u00fcrste. F\u00fcrste says the concept took a while for people to understand and the business was badly hampered by Covid, which forced the cancelation of races around the world. Now, though, HYROX is seeing exponential growth and is racing to catch up with the increased demand. Some former athletes have also tested themselves against the challenge, including former NFL linebacker Curt Maggitt and ex-soccer star John Terry. \u201cIt took time to break through in a certain way, to really get into that wider range of people, seeing what it is and stepping out of that shadow,\u201d co-founder F\u00fcrste tells CNN. With its growing popularity, HYROX is now looking to further professionalize the sport, which has Olympic aspirations. Earlier this year, anti-doping measures were brought into the single and doubles rulebooks, meaning HYROX athletes are now held to the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). \u201cWe are not there yet, but if one day HYROX would be an Olympic sport, that would be the ultimate goal and achievement and just a very, very cool thing,\u201d F\u00fcrste adds. Before even entertaining Olympic status,\u00a0though, F\u00fcrste says a governing body and national federations would need to be created \u2013 things that take time to set up. But there is certainly appetite from the athletes, and Jacoby hopes to one day represent her country. \u201cYou won\u2019t be seeing me going away until then,\u201d says Jacoby when asked about the sport\u2019s progression towards Olympic status. \u201cTo be an Olympic athlete is the absolute highest level you could ever reach.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/sport/hyrox-meg-jacoby-celia-duff-olympics-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "sports"}}

But for Carlos Alcaraz, it is so often a moment when he unleashes his best tennis and dispatches his opponents with a languid ease \u2013 a quality he once again displayed on Friday when he defeated American Frances Tiafoe 5-7 6-2 4-6 7-6(7-2) 6-2 in a five-set thriller in their third-round Wimbledon clash. The defending Wimbledon champion has now won a remarkable 12 matches in five sets and lost just one. \u201c(Those statistics are) an advantage for me,\u201d he told reporters afterwards. \u201cThat\u2019s why I am feeling really, really well physically, and in those situations, I play at my high level.\u201d \u201cIn the fifth set, I think I increase my tennis, my level,\u201d the No. 3 seed added. \u201cI\u2019m feeling much better than the opponent physically, mentally. I know that the other guy has to play a really high level of tennis if he wants to beat me. That helps me a lot to feel better.\u201d Tiafoe won the first set, breaking Alcaraz at 5-5 when the Spaniard was unable to cope with one of his deep returns, before holding his own serve to seal his lead. Alcaraz retaliated in the second to level the increasingly entertaining match, but he was unable to capitalize on this momentum as Tiafoe took the third set, finding his form after a difficult season in which he has slid down the rankings to become the world No. 29. Then, at 4-4 in the fourth set, Alcaraz found himself 0-30 down on his serve and in real danger of crashing out of the tournament before he took an important hold and dragged the set to a tiebreak where he unleashed a series of powerful groundstrokes to once again level the match. And Alcaraz completed the comeback in the fifth to win his 10th consecutive match at Wimbledon and advance to the fourth round where he will face either Ugo Humbert or Brandon Nakashima. \u201cJust ultimate respect,\u201d Tiafoe joked afterwards, according to Reuters. \u201cHim just saying, \u2018It\u2019s good to see you play like that.\u2019 Me just saying, \u2018I can\u2019t stand you!\u2019 I told him to go for another great run.\u201d Coco cruises, Raducanu surprises Elsewhere, No. 2 seed Coco Gauff reached the fourth round as she swept aside British qualifier Sonay Kartal 6-4 6-0 on Friday. \u201cThis was my first time ever playing a British player here, so I was honestly a bit nervous, as I knew you guys would support her, which is totally understandable,\u201d Gauff said in her on-court interview afterwards. \u201cThankfully, you guys are pretty nice to me.\u201d Another former US Open champion, Emma Raducanu, also reached the fourth round with an impressive 6-2 6-3 victory over Maria Sakkari, as she enjoys her best grand slam tournament since that triumph in Flushing Meadows in 2021.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/sport/carlos-alcaraz-frances-tiafoe-wimbledon-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_sport_lewis-hamilton-british-gp-england-euros-spt-intl", "text": "Lewis Hamilton and the England men\u2019s soccer team share a thing or two in common. Both are bursting with pride and talent. Both know what it means to carry the hopes and dreams of a nation on one\u2019s shoulders. Both are no strangers when it comes to being front and center in the public eye. For Hamilton, his arrival onto the global scene came in Melbourne in 2007. A stunning Grand Prix debut that had the motorsport world abuzz and the great, three-time world champion Niki Lauda calling him the best rookie driver he\u2019d ever seen. The following year, he would become the sport\u2019s youngest ever champion at just 23 years of age. A further six titles would follow, equaling the great Michael Schumacher\u2019s record. For Gareth Southgate and England, the spotlight is in the here and the now as they chase an era-defining first trophy in nearly six decades at Euro 2024 in Germany. \u201cI remember being young and thrown into the spotlight. I can\u2019t imagine how it is like for those guys that are on the pitch,\u201d the Mercedes driver told CNN Sport\u2019s Amanda Davies at an IWC Schaffhausen event ahead of the British Grand Prix. \u201cThe pressure from the whole country weighing on you. It is tough. \u201cI\u2019m really, really proud of our team just with all the difficulties that they\u2019ve experienced, and they\u2019ve faced just time and time again, just continuing to get up and the resilience. I think it\u2019s just been really impressive.\u201d A nation expects The Three Lions are aiming to write a new chapter in the country\u2019s soccer folklore with expectations heading into this year\u2019s tournament arguably higher than ever before. Why? Thanks primarily to a star-studded lineup of names including Real Madrid\u2019s player of the year Jude Bellingham, European football\u2019s top goalscorer last season Harry Kane and the Premier League player of the season Phil Foden, among others. Both Southgate and the squad, though, have borne the brunt of heavy criticism from former players, pundits and fans alike for their lackluster displays to date. A stunning escape, though, against Slovakia in the last 16 has tentatively sowed the seeds of an upturn in fortunes. Hamilton, though, is aware of keeping his feet on the ground. \u201cI try not to get too amped up! You know how England always is with the World Cup. I don\u2019t want to apply too much pressure. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got such a talented pool of players. We just need them to be in synergy.\u201d What advice did he wish he\u2019d had received all the way back when the then 22-year-old experienced a stunning breakout year? \u201cIf I was to go back, if I could tell myself in 2007\u2026I could have handled things better; I could have had a better team around me. I think, at the time, I didn\u2019t have a team around me,\u201d he explains. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realize, you\u2019re really, really thrown in the deep end, and if you don\u2019t have the right support structure\u2026 Family is one thing, but I\u2019m talking about people to help protect you and safeguard you and make sure that you don\u2019t fall down all the pit holes that there are. \u201cI would probably been in a happier place, probably as a youngster.\u201d Home pride Hamilton\u2019s elevation into the public sphere hasn\u2019t just been down to his heart-on-sleeve personality, peerless driving ability and record-breaking feats on the racing track: the most career wins, most pole positions, most podium finishes and most career points to name but a few. The seven-time drivers\u2019 champion\u2019s feats have inspired a new generation of British drivers. You only need to look at the class of 2024 to see that in effect with Hamilton joined by teammate George Russell, McLaren\u2019s Lando Norris and Ferrari junior Ollie Bearman who\u2019ll be joining the US-based Haas team next season. \u201cI think when I was younger, maybe I felt the pressure [\u2026] But we have so many British drivers now, so it\u2019s like the pressure\u2019s a bit off,\u201d he laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing to do with me,\u201d he says humbly. \u201cWe just produce really great drivers for some reason. We have a history of it and it\u2019s great to see. I feel very proud to be amongst them.\u201d Away from the track, the sport\u2019s first and only Black world champion has also become the sport\u2019s conscience. Standing up against injustice and calling for more to be done to address some of the challenges concerning diversity, representation and inclusion in motorsport through his charity, Mission 44. Last year, Mission 44 delivered outreach programs in Austin, Silverstone and Sao Paulo, positively impacting more than 150 young people. Emotional year England\u2019s bid to reach the semifinals at Euro 2024 falls on the same weekend as Hamilton is set to race at the British Grand Prix for the final time for the Silver Arrows. The Brit stunned the motorsport world earlier this year when it was announced that he would be leaving Mercedes at the end of the year to join Ferrari for the 2025 campaign. Does he feel emotional at the prospect of a last dance at the iconic Silverstone circuit with his current outfit? \u201cAt the moment, it just feels like another race. Everything feels the same. It feels like we\u2019re still trying to develop. We\u2019re trying to win. We\u2019re trying to progress through the season,\u201d he states. \u201cWe\u2019re so streamlined in our focus and our efforts that I\u2019m not really getting in the emotional state. \u201cThere have been races earlier in the year where I\u2019ve been like \u2018This is going to be my last race with Mercedes at this track,\u2019 so maybe when I\u2019m there, I\u2019ll feel that. \u201cThe feelings have been far more or sometimes less than I expected, but it\u2019s definitely an emotional year.\u201d After dominating the sport through the turbo-hybrid era and winning eight Constructors\u2019 titles in a row from 2014 to 2021, Mercedes\u2019 failure to adapt to the new technical regulations since the 2022 season has seen them slide down the pecking order behind Red Bull and Ferrari. 2023 was especially painful with the team posting a winless season for the first time since 2011. Fortunately, though, his home race has proved to be a very happy hunting ground with Hamilton winning a record eight times at the circuit. And this season has seen the team show glimpses of promise. A third-placed finish for George Russell in Montreal last month was followed by double success \u2013 Hamilton securing his first podium finish of the season in Spain and Russell claiming his second ever race win at last weekend\u2019s Austrian Grand Prix. \u201cThis is a huge boost for everyone back at the factory who have been working tirelessly over the last few years and not been getting that success,\u201d says Hamilton. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve had so many lows and everyone\u2019s had a difficult time, I think you notice and appreciate the good days more than normal. \u201cI think when we were winning all the time, it was just, \u2018Yeah, we\u2019re winning.\u2019 That\u2019s where I think that was. \u201cIt definitely is more special for them.\u201d While the 39-year-old hasn\u2019t tasted a race victory since the penultimate race of the 2021 campaign in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, the week before he saw his bid for a record-breaking eighth Drivers\u2019 Championship end in controversial circumstances in Abu Dhabi, his status remains undiminished. What chance then of a win this season to cap off his 12th and final season at Mercedes? \u201cI think we\u2019re getting closer, and I think last race is showing of that,\u201d he says. \u201cI think in pure speed in terms of earning it through being the quickest that we can\u2026 I don\u2019t feel we\u2019re too far away.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/sport/lewis-hamilton-british-gp-england-euros-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2022_07_25_sport_black-representation-swimming-equality-spt-intl", "text": "Omie Dale has fond memories of splashing in the sea as a child, of racing through water parks and swimming in backwaters and rivers.   \u201cThere\u2019s so much joy that can be had once you learn to swim, once you\u2019ve abandoned those fears and you can get in the water,\u201d the 25-year-old Dale, who is based in southeast London, tells CNN Sport.  Even though swimming is a joyful experience for Dale, the stark reality is that many Black communities in Britain and the US do not have safe access to swimming lessons and public pools due to historic racism and segregation \u2013 a problem that is especially alarming given that, as Dale says, it is \u201cthe only sport that can save your life.\u201d  A history of exclusion The lack of access afforded to Black communities in Britain is what motivated Dale to become a swimming teacher in September 2019.  \u201cI used to work in Kensington (in London) as a lifeguard and some of the richest people live in that borough, but also some of the poorest,\u201d she says. She saw there was a difference when private schools and independent schools would come in and all the kids were able to swim, yet hardly any children of the same age that Dale saw from state schools could swim 25 meters.  \u201cThere\u2019s a real class barrier in the sport of swimming,\u201d Dale adds.   She is a director of Swimunity, a collective offering free swimming lessons to women and children in North Kensington, West London. It was born in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster in 2017, when a residential block caught on fire, killing 72 people \u2013 and leaving many more without homes.   \u201cThere\u2019s like a lot of people who come to swim lessons \u2026 who have undergone some form of trauma, whether that be water-related trauma or trauma related to their everyday lives,\u201d Dale says.   \u201cMany people say it\u2019s like an escape from their daily lives or is, actually, the first time that they\u2019ve taken time for themselves.\u201d  While 77% of children from the most affluent families in England can swim 25 meters unaided, only 34% from the least affluent families can, according to a 2021 survey from Sport England, a non-departmental public body that fosters grassroots sports in England.  About 95% of Black adults and 80% of Black children in England do not regularly participate in swimming, according to Sport England\u2019s report, published in January 2020. Likewise, about 93% of Asian adults and 78% of Asian children, including those with Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi heritage, do not regularly participate in swimming, the same research found. This trend extends to the US, where nearly 64% of Black children have \u201clow\u201d or no ability to swim, compared with 40% of their White peers, according to 2017 data from the country\u2019s national governing body for the sport at a competitive level, USA Swimming.   The underrepresentation of Black people in the pool in the US can be traced back to the early 20th century.   Public swimming pools became popular in North America in the 1920s and 30s and were initially open to all. However, Northern politicians stipulated a \u201cWhites Only\u201d rule, referencing racist fears about Black men fraternizing with White women.   Even after legal racial segregation ended in the US in 1964, public pools continued to be hostile environments. As people of color began to use public pools, White swimmers retreated to the privacy of their own pools and private clubs, where expensive fees continue to be an economic barrier for Black families who cannot afford the cost.    Similar examples in Britain illustrate how racial and class inequalities lead to the systemic exclusion of Black people in pools. For example, more than 4.2 million people in the UK live in ethnically diverse communities where Covid-19 national lockdowns resulted in the closure or mothballing of pools, according to Swim England \u2013 England\u2019s national swimming governing body \u2013 and the Black Swimming Association (BSA), a UK-based charity that aims to encourage more African, Caribbean and Asian communities to take up swimming.  \u2018We cannot keep recovering bodies\u2019  Globally, drowning is the third leading cause of accidental injury-related death and at least 236,000 people die each year from drowning, according to 2019 data from the World Health Organization (WHO). Children are particularly affected, with drowning being one of the top five causes of death for those aged 1-14 years in 48 of 85 countries studied by the WHO.   And while natural disasters and irregular migration are notorious risk factors, so are lower socioeconomic status, lack of higher education and being a member of an ethnic minority, depending on the country, WHO research shows.  \u201cMost drowning incidents happen when people never intend to get into the water in the first place,\u201d says Dale, who was awarded Swim Teacher of the Year by Swim England in 2021.  In December 2019, three members of the same Black British family \u2013 a 53-year-old father and his two children \u2013 died in a swimming pool at a resort in Costa del Sol, Spain, Reuters reported. The father and his 16-year-old son had reportedly leapt into the water to try to save his nine-year-old daughter, who was drowning.   Danielle Obe is the co-founder and chair of the BSA. She told CNN Sport that the Costa del Sol deaths prompted her to establish the BSA in March 2020, alongside Olympic swimmer Alice Dearing, journalist Seren Jones and songwriter, rapper and producer Ed Accura.    \u201cThis was devastating because these families were actually acquainted to me and they were from my local community,\u201d Obe says. \u201c(At) that point, I called Alice and Seren, and I said, \u2018We\u2019ve been talking about doing something for our community. We\u2019ve got to do something. We\u2019ve got to do it now. We cannot keep recovering bodies.\u2019\u201d   \u201cIt\u2019s no longer just about that lack of representation,\u201d Obe adds.   \u201cIt\u2019s now about saving lives, vital water safety, education for all. Swimming is an intervention. Swimming is a life skill.\u201d  However, there is still a lack of data when it comes to drowning-related deaths by ethnicity in the UK, says Obe.  \u201cAt the moment, we don\u2019t know how much of a disparity there is between drowning and fatalities, aquatic fatalities for different communities in the UK because, up until now, drowning data isn\u2019t really captured by ethnicity, which is another point, another issue that the BSA is looking to tackle.\u201d \u2018People just don\u2019t think Black people should swim\u2019  Dearing, the first Black female swimmer to represent Britain at the Olympics when she competed at Tokyo 2020, \u201cimplores\u201d people to learn to swim.   \u201cI have been quite torn between the amazing achievement of being the first Black woman to represent GB in swimming but wanting to be my own person, my own athlete, who\u2019s known for being an athlete and not for her race and her sport combined together,\u201d she tells CNN Sport. \u201cI take the two of them just as they are \u2013 kind of like separate things. I\u2019m trying to be the best athlete and best role model that I can be to show people that they can do the sport, that the sport is for everybody.\u201d At the age of 24, Dearing was making history in Japan and became a beacon of hope for young people \u2013 especially Black girls \u2013 who wanted to break into the sport.   But her personal triumph also drew attention to the institutional access gap for people of color in swimming.    \u201cFortunately, for myself, I haven\u2019t come across any barriers at the level I\u2019m at currently,\u201d Dearing says.   \u201cBut I have faced barriers when I was younger and issues where people just don\u2019t think Black people should swim, or do swim, or think that we\u2019re better suited to other sports and so shouldn\u2019t even learn to swim or attempt swimming in the first place.\u201d  CNN reached out to the International Swimming Federation (FINA), Sport England and USA Swimming requesting a breakdown of Black and ethnic minority participation in swimming at grassroots and professional levels of the sport. However, they told CNN they were unable to provide such data.  FINA \u2013 the global governing body for swimming \u2013 told CNN it does not have a breakdown of the ethnicities of swimmers at a grassroots or elite level.   FINA said in 2021 it allocated $6.6 million towards development programs for distribution among all national federations and continental associations, while also pushing for diversity in the sport through its \u201cSwimming for All, Swimming for Life\u201d program.   \u201cFINA remains fully committed to non-discrimination,\u201d the organization said to CNN in a statement. \u201cFINA continues to work hard to ensure that the global aquatics community is a place where all athletes, coaches and administrators are treated equally. \u201cWork will continue to develop and grow with the support of members of the aquatics community as we strive to be at the forefront of this essential area,\u201d FINA added.    Sport England told CNN in a statement that it is \u201ccommitted to increasing investment in facilities and organisations across England to try to level up access to good quality sports and activities.\u201d \u201cBarriers to getting active persist and have even been exacerbated for some disadvantaged groups \u2013 like women, people with long-term health conditions, disabled people, people from ethnically diverse communities and lower socio-economic groups,\u201d the statement added.   Sport England said in May it announced further funding that brings its total investment in its 121 partners to more than \u00a3550 million ($670 million), which they\u2019ve selected \u201cdue to their unique position to tackle entrenched activity inequalities and influence positive change throughout the sector, their own networks and beyond.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s not all about the economic side of things. It is also about getting people to feel comfortable with putting their kids in swim lessons and in competitive swimming so that they can then go and do other aquatic-based sports,\u201d Joel Shinofield, the managing director of sport development at USA Swimming, told CNN during a phone call.  USA Swimming is a membership-serviced organization that has over 3,100 clubs and more than 400,000 members, according to the official website.   \u201cOur goal is to facilitate opportunities and make sure they\u2019re good ones. While our clubs are the ones that do that on the local level, the resources, guidance, support, financial investment that we provide can shift who those opportunities can be provided to and more broadly create access,\u201d he added.   Shinofield said that USA Swimming has established a 10-year initiative that will grant $1 million to develop learn-to-swim and competitive opportunities for communities served by Historical Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The program was announced in 2021, according to the USA Swimming official website.   Serving underrepresented communities  From representing their organization at the UK\u2019s first Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Summit For Sport in Birmingham, England earlier this year to facilitating swimming classes in Hackney \u2013 one of the most deprived boroughs in London \u2013 Obe hopes that the BSA will help bridge the barrier through community-level engagement.   \u201cThat community engagement really is to build trust, accountability and collaboration with disenfranchised communities and the sector,\u201d says Obe.  \u201cOnly in understanding these attitudes and understanding some of the barriers that preclude our communities from engaging in aquatics can we begin to drive change.\u201d  In August 2021, the BSA announced it would conduct a research program with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the University of Portsmouth, exploring the behaviors and barriers that prevent African, Caribbean and Asian communities from swimming.    Speaking about the program, Obe says: \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to inspire confidence with African, Caribbean and Asian communities, and the only way we\u2019re able to do that is to ensure that we understand where these communities are in the first place and understand why they don\u2019t engage in aquatics, why we don\u2019t see the representation pool side and why we don\u2019t even see the representation within some aquatic organizations.\u201d  Dale also volunteers with Mental Health Swims, a grassroots organization that facilitates swimming meet-ups for people struggling with their mental health. As part of her work for the organization, she coordinates swim events in south London to help swimmers access the mental health benefits of the sport. She also volunteers for Pride in Water, a network that aims to increase LGBTQ+ representation in swimming.   \u2018The future is bright\u2019  Dearing says that despite the racial and economic barriers to swimming for African, Caribbean and Asian communities, she\u2019s still optimistic about the changing landscape of the sport.  \u201cI really think if anything is going to change, it\u2019s going to be now, it\u2019s going to be over the next couple of years,\u201d she says. \u201cEach story is different, each person is different and has to be understood in their own way, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, that\u2019s just another challenge that we have to face and we\u2019re up for it.  \u201cIt\u2019s tough \u2013 it\u2019s not a quick fix, but the future is bright.  \u201cI like to feel that I\u2019m giving something back to swimming and, hopefully, giving something to the Black community to hopefully achieve, strive for and change the way that Black people are viewed in swimming and the way Black people view swimming.  \u201cIt\u2019s a double-edged sword; I absolutely love doing it. Sometimes, it\u2019s really frightening and daunting, but if I\u2019m trying to make the world a better place, then sometimes you got to step out and scare yourself.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/07/25/sport/black-representation-swimming-equality-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_07_06_sport_england-switzerland-quarterfinal-euro-2024-spt-intl", "text": "England reached its second successive European Championship semifinal after a 5-3 penalty shootout victory over Switzerland at Euro 2024 on Saturday after the quarterfinal had ended 1-1. Trent Alexander-Arnold scored the decisive penalty to seal the win for England as it booked its spot in the final four having lost in the final at the last edition of the tournament. Breel Embolo had opened the scoring when he tapped home from close range in the 75th minute in Dusseldorf, only for Bukayo Saka to equalize just five minutes later with a stunning left-footed effort. Nothing could separate the two teams in extra-time and so the game went to penalties. Switzerland\u2019s first penalty from Manuel Akanji was saved by Jordan Pickford and that miss proved pivotal as England\u2019s players dispatched their attempts with aplomb. England hasn\u2019t got the greatest track record in penalty shootouts in major tournaments, including at the Euros three years ago where Gareth Southgate\u2019s team lost to Italy in the final on penalties, but Saturday\u2019s success is a further step towards banishing those demons. Prince William was at the D\u00fcsseldorf Arena to watch England\u2019s victory. England will face the Netherlands in the semifinals, after the Oranje beat Turkey 2-1 later on Saturday in Berlin. \u201cIt is what we have practiced,\u201d Alexander-Arnold, who came on as a substitute during extra-time, told the BBC. \u201cWhen the gaffer said I was taking one, I enjoy it and I practice it \u2013 I knew I had to just execute it. All five penalties from us were great.\u201d England entered Saturday\u2019s game with question marks around its performances at Euro 2024, having flattered to deceive offensively and being saved by some late heroics from Jude Bellingham in the last-16 round against Slovakia. The first half was played in an open fashion, with Bellingham asserting his influence, while Switzerland captain Granit Xhaka \u2013 coming off a superb season for his club team, Bayer Leverkusen \u2013 continued his excellent form at the tournament in playing a vital cog in his team\u2019s possession-based game. England grew into the first half as two of it young stars \u2013 Saka and Kobbie Mainoo \u2013 almost combined on the brink of halftime, only for Xhaka to appear out of nowhere to get in a crucial block. Whatever Switzerland manager Murat Yakin told his players at the interval seemed to make an impact as his players turned up the pressure on the England defense. That pressure told when some intricate passing released Dan Ndoye down the right and his cross was turned home by Embolo to give Switzerland a deserved lead. Going behind prompted Southgate to make changes from his bench, but it was one of the starters who drew England level. Saka, who had looked England\u2019s liveliest player throughout the game, cut inside from the right wing before unleashing a powerful effort which clipped off the far post and into the back of the net. It was England\u2019s first shot on target. In the first few minutes of extra-time, Yann Sommer produced a stunning save to deny Declan Rice whose long-range effort was heading into the bottom corner before the Swiss keeper\u2019s outstretched hand pushed the ball away for a corner.. With penalties looming, Switzerland nearly got a dramatic late winner through Xherdan Shaqiri \u2013 who spent much of his club career in England with Stoke City and Liverpool \u2013 when his corner took Pickford by surprise and looked to be heading in, only for it to cannon off the bar. After Cole Palmer scored England\u2019s first effort in the penalty shootout, Akanji had his effort saved by Pickford. England\u2019s other penalties from Saka, Ivan Toney, Bellingham and Alexander-Arnold gave Sommer no chance of saving them. Southgate himself has first-hand experience of missing a crucial penalty in a semifinal defeat by Germany at Euro 1996, but England\u2019s current crop of players showed no sign of the weight of history resting on their shoulders to book the team\u2019s spot in the semifinals.

But Ecuador found an equalizer in stoppage time when Kevin Rodr\u00edguez glanced his header into the bottom corner from John Yeboah\u2019s whipped cross.

Once upon a time, an internal monologue of insecurity \u2013 \u2018Man, I\u2019m stinking today\u2019 \u2013 would have been the soundtrack to the American\u2019s march past the masses. These days, though, it\u2019s an entirely different voice \u2013 one that leads him to pause at the ropes and make the day of one enraptured young fan. \u201cI throw a few more golf balls out than I ever have \u2026 Not only does it make them happy, but it makes me happy,\u201d Spieth told CNN Sport\u2019s Patrick Snell. \u201cIt\u2019s cool to see a kid smile.

At 30 years old, Spieth is far from a veteran. Yet 11 years, 276 events and 13 wins into his PGA Tour career, the former world No. 1 already experienced and witnessed more than many golfers will in a lifetime. Sporting immortality still beckons, with Spieth just one PGA Championship victory away from becoming only the sixth player in history to clinch all four professional majors, but the Texan is eyeing a legacy that can be measured in more than just silverware. \u201cYou start to realize that the trophies and all that, it\u2019s great and it happens, but they are a blip in time,\u201d he said. \u201cThat you can make somebody feel good, how you make somebody feel, is significantly more important than how you entertain them once. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to lose perspective when you\u2019re in the middle of competition, but the more [you play], you can recognize it\u2019s just a game and the impact we have can be way more important than that entertainment when we pass by on that one hole.\u201d Back to the start Spieth\u2019s latest effort to deliver such an impact takes the form of the \u201cCrush It!

Spieth will host a golf clinic for the top 100 fundraisers before playing alongside each young golfer for one hole at Brookhaven \u2013 coincidentally both his and Invited\u2019s first club. As the sun sets, he will take a seat beside the flames to anchor a Fireside chat with competitors. The host is expecting some \u201ccrazy\u201d questions, many stemming from Netflix\u2019s fly-on-the-wall golf docuseries \u201cFull Swing,\u201d but is just as interested in what he can take from those asking them. \u201cThese kids, you watch them \u2013 their focus, their desire \u2013 they\u2019re so nice and then the second it\u2019s their turn to hit, they \u2013 the competitive nature sinks in,\u201d Spieth said. \u201cI\u2019m really excited to just watch kids be kids. We just kind of lose sight of it professionally sometimes. We get involved in more of the business and technical sides of things and it\u2019s really fun to just be around a bunch of kids playing golf. \u201cIt reminds us why we love the game and we should never forget that.\u201d Money raised will head to the Jordan Spieth Family Foundation, which was built to raise awareness of and fund four key \u201cpillars\u201d: junior golf, military veterans, pediatric cancer and children with special needs. Spieth launched the endeavor as a 19-year-old rookie in large part due to his younger sister Ellie, who has autism. More than a decade on, his sibling continues to inspire. \u201cIt\u2019s a love, a support, a perspective that a lot of other people don\u2019t necessarily have,\u201d Spieth said. \u201cI\u2019ve always said that we\u2019re blessed because we get to watch her. It\u2019s raw emotion and her joy is just pure joy \u2013 there\u2019s no faking. It\u2019s fun to watch her be and it\u2019s fun to support her as she\u2019s always been there to support us.\u201d \u2018He\u2019s doing more for the game of golf than any professional golfer is doing\u2019 While Spieth is confident that junior golf is becoming increasingly diverse, he believes \u201cquite a bit\u201d of work is still left to be done at the grassroots level of the sport in terms of inclusivity. Poetically, the biggest driver for change may lie outside the traditional channels. While Spieth is pleased with the efforts his foundation is making \u2013 such as supporting the PGA Junior League, First Tee and other nonprofits \u2013 he is left awestruck by the influence of NBA icon Steph Curry. An avid \u2013 and rather talented \u2013 golfer himself, Golden State Warriors star Curry launched his \u201cUnderrated Golf Tour\u201d in 2022, offering an all-expenses paid competitive opportunity for underrepresented young players. Ahead of last month\u2019s US Open, the four-time NBA champion was presented with the Charlie Sifford Award, a prize \u2013 named after the PGA Tour\u2019s first Black player \u2013 bestowed by the World Golf Hall of Fame that honors those advancing diversity in golf. For Spieth, there could not have been a more worthy recipient. \u201cHe\u2019s doing more for the game of golf than any professional golfer is doing,\u201d Spieth insists.\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely remarkable.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re trying to help where we can, but some people like Steph have bigger platforms and it\u2019s really cool with the stuff he\u2019s doing. As much as we try to help, he\u2019s got the opportunity and he\u2019s acting on it tenfold.\u201d As the major season culminates with the Open Championship in Scotland on July 18, Spieth\u2019s sights are firmly trained on more major glory. Yet should the 2017 champion not get his hands on a second Claret Jug, he will take some comfort if he hears one of his favorite soundbites from beyond the ropes at Royal Troon. \u201cKids coming up and saying, \u2018I didn\u2019t play the game of golf \u2018til I watched you and then I wanted to take it up.\u2019 It\u2019s really neat when you hear that,\u201d Spieth said. \u201cBecause I love the game, and I know that the game is a really good pathway into creating good human beings going forward. \u201cI never really got into it for that. I just loved it myself and I loved competing and so I just wanted to keep doing it. You don\u2019t really realize until later on that, if you do it the right way, it can have that kind of impact and bring somebody else into the game.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/sport/jordan-spieth-crush-it-cup-golf-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2023_02_05_sport_head-injury-suicide-female-athletes-intl-spt-cmd", "text": "Kelly Catlin and Ellie Soutter never met, but they had a lot in common.  Both were commanding athletes: Catlin, a US track cyclist, was a three-times world champion and Olympic silver medalist, and Soutter, a snowboarder, was tipped to be one of Team Great Britain\u2019s strongest contenders for the 2022 Winter Olympics, having already won a bronze medal at the 2017 European Youth Olympic Festival.  Both were incredibly smart \u2013 Catlin was studying for a master\u2019s degree in computational and mathematical engineering at Stanford University, while Soutter learned to speak French in about six months, according to her father.   At times they almost seemed superhuman. In 2013, after only three weeks of formal training and having broken her wrist, Soutter became British Champion with her arm in a cast. Meanwhile, Catlin, who had a tenderness for children, once rode 80 miles through sleet and snow to speak to a grade school about her Olympic experience.    Yet these two women\u2019s lives were tragically cut short after they sustained serious head injuries in their pursuit of sporting greatness and then took their own lives. Catlin was 23, while Soutter died by suicide on her 18th birthday.  Females may be more susceptible to concussion, and they also have worse and prolonged symptoms after their injury than men, according to a review of 25 studies of sport-related concussion published in the Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine.  However, women remain significantly underrepresented within sport and exercise science research. This, leading experts warn, means they often do not get the treatment or aftercare they need following a head injury.  Women\u2019s sports have historically not received the same attention or funding as men\u2019s sports, Dr. Ann McKee, Director of the Boston University Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s been shown that women athletes are more likely to get a concussion, they tend to have longer recovery periods,\u201d McKee added. \u201cWe do not have enough information about what happens in the female brain. We don\u2019t know if women are biologically more susceptible to these injuries,\u201d she said, adding that some research suggests the size and musculature of women\u2019s necks could play a part. Kelly  Before becoming a track cyclist, Catlin, a triplet, was a national champion road cyclist and time trial national champion, her father Mark, told CNN. After winning a Canadian international race at 17 she was invited to an Olympic training camp for a try out, where, impressed by her performance numbers, coaches immediately offered her a position on the track pursuit team.  Catlin\u2019s father, Mark, told CNN, that his daughter was \u201cintense\u201d and \u201cambitious,\u201d attributes she channeled into her sporting life. Her life changed irrevocably in January 2019. Practicing fast downhill descents in the hills near Los Angeles, she crashed and went skidding down the road.  Despite suffering road rash, Catlin got back on her bike, and finished the ride. It wasn\u2019t her first crash \u2013 she had experienced 4 or 5 hard crashes before this, her father said, and after the latest, she didn\u2019t have any symptoms at the time.  But soon after, at a World Cup track event in Berlin, Catlin was gripped by a sudden and severe headache.   \u201cShe couldn\u2019t compete,\u201d her father said. \u201cKelly is kind of this stoical individual. And if she\u2019s rolling around on the ground, clutching her head, it has to be a severe thing.\u201d On closer inspection, Catlin\u2019s helmet from LA had dents in it. Her father told CNN that this, coupled with her symptoms, caused her family to become aware she had suffered a concussion, which was later confirmed with a diagnosis from Stanford\u2019s Health Centre.  A concussion is a brain injury which happens after a hit to the head or body causes the brain to move back and forth inside the skull, according to the CDC. When Catlin returned to the US, her father says she was examined by the track training center in Colorado. It was confirmed she suffered a concussion, and a return to training protocol was advised, but not implemented or communicated to her coach, he said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any follow-up from Colorado after this. I believe they assumed she would seek care at Stanford,\u201d he told CNN.  CNN has reached out to Stanford and USA Cycling for comment.  Catlin\u2019s symptoms didn\u2019t improve, and in weekly phone calls with her parents, she admitted she was struggling with schoolwork and was unable to concentrate. Stanford Health Center, having diagnosed Catlin with concussion with ongoing symptoms, recommended that she decrease her training for 2 weeks and then gradually build back up and start sessions with an athletic trainer, medical documents sent to CNN by her father show. She was referred to a concussion specialist, the document adds. She tried to train, but \u201cshe would have to stop because she got a severe headache just from walking,\u201d according to her father. Her heart rate would also accelerate rapidly from even the smallest exertion, leaving her with \u201cno exercise tolerance whatsoever,\u201d he added.  Her injury had other consequences. \u201cAs far as we knew she was never a person that suffered from depression. She had an interesting sense of humor.  She was always upbeat and bubbly about things,\u201d her father told CNN.  \u201cShe basically thought her life was over. She was no longer able to be the athlete that she was, she was failing her teammates. And she wasn\u2019t able to succeed in school now. And I think ultimately, that\u2019s why she took her life, because she thought her life was over,\u201d he added.  At the end of January, Catlin made a serious but non-fatal suicide attempt, and was involuntarily admitted to the locked psychiatric ward at Stanford, her father told CNN. A month after that attempt, she took her own life.     Ellie   Soutter\u2019s father Tony said there were many dimensions to his young daughter \u2013 not only was she an \u201cadrenaline junkie,\u201d but she was \u201cvery conscientious\u201d and excelled in school, even after moving from England to France.   Aged 12, Soutter took up snowboarding at school \u2013 and just months later, she was spotted in her hometown resort of Les Gets and trialed by Team Great Britain in February 2013.  \u201cIt was quite obvious why she kept winning competitions because she just made it easy,\u201d her father said. \u201cShe just made it look graceful and beautiful.\u201d But training took its toll \u2013 Soutter told CNN that his daughter suffered seven major concussions in five years, between 2013 and 2018.  \u201cI was being advised by doctors \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, she\u2019s young enough she\u2019ll bounce back. As she progressed, becoming an elite athlete starting on the World Cup circuit, every time she had another concussion, they got worse, and they took longer to recover from,\u201d he told CNN.     \u201cWith every concussion, with the exception of a few minor knocks, Ellie saw a doctor in person,\u201d he added. \u201cI was always told that she was young enough to bounce back to full health after each case and therefore never consulted with the doctors that I met, about any previous concussions.\u201d But Soutter\u2019s final concussion was so \u201chuge\u201d that she spent two nights in the hospital. \u201cWhen I got there, she didn\u2019t even know who I was or where she was,\u201d her father said. Soutter was then selected for the Junior Snowboard World Championships in New Zealand August 2018.  But a month before the competition, she died by suicide.  Her father said a neurologist conducted a CT scan of her brain and reaction tests three months after her final concussion, but said she was \u201cabsolutely fine\u201d and could continue competing.                                                                                                                                 Like Catlin, Soutter had issues with studying and concentrating, becoming more insular as she suffered from crippling headaches. She also started suffering from insomnia.  \u201cShe would literally sit with the tutor a good month after a concussion, and suddenly, she\u2019d go blind. She\u2019d not be able to see \u2013 everything would go black and dark,\u201d her father said. After missing a flight to snowboard training, Soutter died by suicide on her 18th birthday. Team GB referred CNN to GB Snowsport when approached for comment, adding that Ellie only competed for Team GB at one event.  In order to represent Britain in international competitions, GB Snowsport says athletes or their coaches are required to demonstrate that the athlete has reached established performance criteria, is of the relevant technical ability to compete, and has appropriate medical clearance to compete. A large number of athletes can represent Britain at different levels of international competition but are not part of a programme delivered and overseen by GB Snowsport.  \u201cAs Ellie was not part of the GB Snowsport programme, we were unable to implement a personalised recovery and management programme for Ellie,\u201d a spokesperson for GB Snowsport told CNN in an email. \u201cShe was, however, covered by national policies and protocols around fitness to compete, and would not have been cleared for any activity \u2013 training or competition \u2013 overseen by GB Snowsport without being able to demonstrate appropriate medical sign-off,\u201d they added. The spokesperson for GB Snowsport told CNN: \u201cWe take concussions and head injuries incredibly seriously, and in reviewing contemporaneous records from the time that Ellie was involved in snowsport we are confident that GB Snowsport staff applied and followed every appropriate process.\u201d Catlin and Soutter aren\u2019t the only young sporting women whose lives have been cut short in this way. After 29-year-old Australian rules football player Jacinda Barclay took her life in 2020, post-mortem research by scientists found that she had degradation to her cerebral white matter unusual for someone her age.  \u201cFor someone her age, you would expect to see lovely pristine white matter, and hers looked like she was an old woman in that it was basically degraded,\u201d Michael Buckland, founder and Executive Director of the Australian Sports Brain Bank, who studied Barclay\u2019s brain, told CNN.  \u201cWe haven\u2019t gone back and done specific white matter studies on our donors,\u201d he told CNN, adding that the bank hasn\u2019t done peer reviewed research on this.  \u201cBut what struck me, just as someone that sees a lot of brains \u2013 this is not normal for someone of that age.\u201d  Damage to white matter has been associated with dementia, according to research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.   Opportunities missed Suicide after concussion is rare. However patients diagnosed with concussion or mild traumatic brain injury had double the risk of suicide and a higher risk of suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts than people without brain injuries, a 2018 study from researchers at the University of Harvard published in JAMA Neurology found. Dr. Robert Cantu, clinical professor of neurology at the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at Boston University School of Medicine told CNN that there are several theories as to why incidence of suicide is higher in people who have suffered concussion. One theory, he explained, is that those suffering from persistent post-concussion symptoms may have structural or functional brain damage and could be experiencing \u201cbehavioral dysregulation: short fuse, irritability, [and] can\u2019t suppress impulses the way you normally could.\u201d   With these emotional problems, \u201cthey would be more prone to perhaps do something impulsive, like commit suicide,\u201d Cantu, medical director of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, told CNN. A second theory, Cantu noted, is that post-concussive symptoms prevent people from getting back into their sport and stop them \u201cfrom being the person that they were before their injury.\u201d Neither theory is proven to the exclusion of the other, Cantu said, adding he thinks increased suicidality was \u201ca combined factor involving both in many, if not most cases.\u201d There are also differences in the way brain injuries affect women.  A study of female soccer players across US high schools found they are nearly twice as likely to suffer concussion as their male counterparts, according to research that looked at over 80,000 adolescent athletes, published in the journal JAMA Network Open.  Women remain significantly underrepresented within sport and exercise science research: a 2021 study examining papers from some of the most influential sports medical journals found that only 6% of the studies were solely focused on women, compared with 31% of studies that included just men. Other researchers have pointed to female sex hormones, with risk of concussion changing with hormone levels during a menstrual cycle.  McKee said all athletes can also experience \u201cnon-concussive\u201d injuries: \u201chits to the head that can be of the same magnitude as concussion, but they don\u2019t rise to the level of symptoms for whatever reason, so a player tends to play right through it.\u201d Cumulative exposure to repetitive head impacts \u2013 including concussion and non- concussive injuries \u2013 increases the risk for the neurodegenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known as CTE, McKee said.  The disease, which can only be formally diagnosed with an autopsy, has mostly been seen in either veterans or people who played contact sports, particularly American football, say researchers. The disease occurs when the brain starts to degenerate likely due to repeated head traumas, according to the Mayo Clinic, which notes CTE is \u201cassociated with recurrent concussions.\u201d But scientists aren\u2019t only concerned about concussions.  Previous studies have shown subconcussive head impacts \u2013 repetitive hits to the head and body that do not cause symptoms \u2013 can still result in long-term neurological disease.   According to The Concussion Legacy Foundation, \u201cthe best available evidence suggests that subconcussive impacts, not concussions, are the driving force behind CTE.\u201d There have been cases of CTE discovered in athletes who have never been diagnosed with a concussion, according to the Concussion Legacy Foundation. And other changes in the brain after repetitive head impacts aside from CTE are likely \u201cequally important,\u201d McKee said. \u201cWe also see damage to the white matter. And that appears to be mostly in the frontal lobe, but also in the temporal lobes,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to understand the relationship of those white matter changes to behavioral and mood symptoms, perhaps even suicidality,\u201d she said.  McKee stressed that concussion management is important, but physicians and athletes should also be aware of other injuries. \u201cThe problem is the subclinical hits \u2013 the non-concussive injuries that aren\u2019t detected, you don\u2019t pull the player off the field \u2013 and they can be in the hundreds or even the 1000s in a single season,\u201d she explained. Lack of research  Though a growing body of data suggests women in sport are more likely to sustain a concussion, have more severe symptoms, and to take longer to recover, most sports-related concussions protocols are based on data from men.  In a review in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers looked at 171 concussion studies written since 1967 which are used to inform the most influential consensus and position statements in treating sports-related concussions. Clinicians rely on these documents to guide their medical practice when treating athletes \u2013 but most of the studies are focused on men. Only 1% of them was looking exclusively at concussions in women and 40% of them didn\u2019t have any women in a sample of participants at all.   There is another risk factor for women in sport when they sustain head injuries, Katherine Snedaker, founder and executive director of PINK Concussions, a non-profit dedicated to women\u2019s health and brain injury, told CNN.  There is a gulf of millions of dollars separating women and men when it comes to average annual salaries in most professional sports. Outside of elite sport, Snedaker says, female athletes often don\u2019t have access to the same medical care as men, meaning head injuries aren\u2019t spotted as routinely.   \u201cThey tend to push really hard through the injury,\u201d she said. And many women can\u2019t afford to take time out to recover: even professional athletes will supplement their sports income with other jobs, she added, and many are caregivers. \u201cWhen they really crater, it\u2019s a couple of days or weeks later.\u201d  Snedaker said female athletes often weren\u2019t aware they had suffered a head injury. If they were, she said, there were no appropriate medical or sporting staff to inform. Not enough support The families of Catlin and Soutter feel the young women didn\u2019t get enough support after their injuries. After Catlin\u2019s first suicide attempt, she was released from an involuntary admission to the psychiatric ward after threatening legal action, and a conference between psychiatrists, her coach and her parents.  She attended therapy sessions, which she agreed to attend during the conference, but found \u201cthey were geared toward suicidal freshman with a whole set of different issues than an elite Olympic athlete,\u201d her father told CNN. She got a referral to a sports psychologist that worked with the Stanford athletic department, but the department forbade the psychologist from seeing Catlin because she was not a varsity athlete, her father added.  She contacted the office of a sports psychologist with whom she had developed a rapport while in the hospital \u2013 but, his appointment secretary said he had no openings for six months, her father told CNN.  \u201cWherever she turned she could not find help,\u201d he said, adding that his daughter tried a suicide hotline several times: she was once put on hold and once received no answer. Catlin described his daughter as a \u201cstoic, female warrior type person that isn\u2019t going to admit that she\u2019s struggling.\u201d  \u201cShe needed a sports psychiatrist that really could understand what she was going through and understand the rigors of her life in terms of preparation for competitions and the athletic side of it and what it could potentially do to you.\u201d Her father said a major factor in his daughter\u2019s death was \u201ca lack of communication between the facilities that were involved in Kelly\u2019s care. No one was in charge and they assumed the other institutions were following up when they weren\u2019t,\u201d he added. In a statement sent to CNN, Luisa Rapport, director of emergency communications and media relations at Stanford University did not address any of the specific allegations made by Catlin\u2019s family.  She said while the university does not discuss in the media the details of individual students\u2019 experiences, \u201csupporting the mental and emotional health of students is a critical priority for Stanford.\u201d  \u201cStudents in need of mental health crisis assistance \u2013 including students having suicidal thoughts \u2013 and those who are concerned about students in need of assistance, can contact the University\u2019s Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) 24 hours-a-day, seven days-a-week,\u201d she added. Rapport said that in addition to this, \u201cthere are multiple places where psychological services may be provided for students depending on individualized need and treatment recommendations, including, for example, affiliated hospital services and clinics through Stanford\u2019s Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, and mental health programs and clinicians in the community.\u201d In a statement sent to CNN, USA Cycling said it was \u201cdevastated\u201d by Catlin\u2019s death, adding: \u201cShe brought focus and determination to everything she did, and served as an inspiration to everyone who knew her.  \u201cAs the National Governing Body for the sport of cycling, USA Cycling prioritizes the holistic wellbeing of the riders on the U.S. National Team and has a longstanding commitment to providing both physical and mental health resources to members of the team,\u201d a representative for USA Cycling added.   After his daughter Ellie\u2019s death, Soutter was contacted by the UNITE Brain Bank, who wanted to study her brain as part of their research into CTE. But even in that facility \u2013 the biggest of its kind in the world \u2013 of some 1,300 brains, only 3% belonged to women, Ann McKee, Director of the Boston University Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center told CNN. \u201cWhen I actually started looking into CTE \u2013 all of the work that they\u2019ve done with the footballers in America, she had every single symptom and more,\u201d Soutter told CNN. \u201cIt was quite obvious to me that there was a definite link in her starting to get into dark places and feeling bad and anxious and not sleeping properly. All of those symptoms \u2026 Every one that\u2019s involved in CTE was part of Ellie\u2019s life,\u201d he added. \u201cI truly believe today that my daughter would be alive had I had any inkling, you know, even the smallest bit of information.\u201d Editor\u2019s Note: If you are in the US and you or a loved one have contemplated suicide, call The National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255) to connect with a trained counselor.
