Superstar forward Jayson Tatum came close to a triple-double, scoring 25 points, grabbing 10 rebounds and dishing out nine assists as Boston moved onto the Eastern Conference Finals for the sixth time in the last eight seasons and for the third year in a row. Celtics center Al Horford \u2013 starting in place of the injured Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is \u2013 drained a career-high-tying six three-pointers, with his final triple coming inside the last minute of the game to send the home fans at TD Garden into raptures. \u201cTonight was a special night for our group because we had this chance to close it out here at home,\u201d said Horford, who finished with 22 points, 15 rebounds, five assists and three blocks. \u201cAnd for me, the biggest thing was bringing energy. \u201cIt\u2019s special when you\u2019re here at the Garden. This is something I just don\u2019t take for granted, the energy of the fans. Our fans, they love the Celtics. They want us to play hard. They want us to play the right way and I just felt very connected with them tonight.\u201d Per the Celtics, Horford became just the third player in NBA playoff history to record a 20-15-5 game at age 37 or older along with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and LeBron James. Every Boston starter scored in double figures on the way to a comfortable victory. The series against the Cavaliers drew parallels with the Celtics\u2019 first-round matchup against the Miami Heat \u2013 the Cavs suffered an upset defeat in Game 2 in both rounds to tie the series at 1-1 before winning three straight to advance. Boston now awaits the winner of the series between the New York Knicks and the Indiana Pacers, which is currently 3-2 in New York\u2019s favor. Game 6 will be played on Friday in Indiana. It was a disappointing end to the postseason for the Cavaliers, meanwhile, who were missing several key rotation players. Center Jarrett Allen missed his eighth consecutive game with injury, while Caris LeVert was also out. Most crucially, however, All-Star guard Donovan Mitchell was again sidelined with a calf injury after also missing Game 4. Mitchell averaged almost 30 points per game across his 10 playoff appearances this season. Evan Mobley scored 33 points to lead the Cavs in scoring and also pulled down seven boards, while veteran forward Marcus Morris Sr. added 25 off the bench. \u201cI was proud of their effort,\u201d Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff said of his team postgame. \u201cThis has been a difficult year for us, for a bunch of different reasons. They never found the time to fold on each other. All they did was find ways to compete.\u201d Don\u010di\u0107 dominates as Mavericks take 3-2 lead against Thunder Luka Don\u010di\u0107 posted a triple-double in a pivotal Game 5 to help the fifth seeded Dallas Mavericks to a 104-92 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder and lift his squad to a 3-2 series lead on the road. The Slovenian superstar has had an up-and-down series as he deals with injuries but appeared to be back to his best on Wednesday night, recording 31 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to play basketball, just focus on basketball,\u201d Don\u010di\u0107 said. \u201cSometimes I forget this is the thing I love, the thing I do. My mental focus was just go out there and play basketball with a smile on my face and just go.\u201d Derrick Jones Jr. added 19 points while Don\u010di\u0107\u2019s backcourt co-star, Kyrie Irving, was held to 12 points. The Thunder \u2013 the West\u2019s top seed \u2013 were led by MVP runner-up Shai Gilgeous-Alexander who scored 30 points in the losing effort. OKC is facing elimination for the first time this postseason after sweeping the New Orleans Pelicans in the first round. The Mavs will look to avoid a Game 7 and close out the series in front of their home fans in Game 6 on Saturday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/sport/boston-celtics-cleveland-cavaliers-game-5-nba-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_sport_ye-yang-pga-championship-tiger-woods-spt-intl", "text": "After tossing and turning all through the night, Y.E. Yang awoke in uncharted waters. To complicate matters further, the golfing equivalent of the kraken circled around him. On Sunday morning at the 2009 PGA Championship, the then-37-year-old South Korean \u2013 ranked 110th in the world \u2013 stood just 18 holes away from becoming the first Asian-born player to win a major golf championship. Yet for one piece of history to be penned, another would have to be erased. Tiger Woods, world No. 1 for four years and counting, had never before surrendered a major after starting the final round atop the leaderboard \u2013 14 leads, 14 wins. Two shots clear, few tuning in to the finale at Hazeltine National in Chaska, Minnesota, expected that run to be snuffed out. Little did they know, \u201cThe Tiger Killer\u201d was on the hunt. Average Joe In 1978, a two-year-old Woods doddered onto the set of the \u201cThe Mike Douglas Show\u201d to showcase his already-impressive swing to the American public. By contrast, Yang \u2013 seven years his senior \u2013 had not even heard of a sport called golf until he was 19. By that age, Woods had already made his debut at The Masters. Just two years later in 1997, he would finish 12 shots ahead of his nearest rival at Augusta National to become the major\u2019s youngest ever winner and strengthen his claim to household name status. Well, perhaps not every household. Some 7,400 miles away in the island province of Jeju, Yang was unaware of professional golf tournaments \u2013 let alone the PGA Tour \u2013 until his early twenties. An aspiring bodybuilder, the teenager and self-confessed \u201caverage Joe\u201d had dreamed of running his own gym. Yet when his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) was torn in a fall down a flight of stairs, so too were those hopes. Needing to make ends meet, a 19-year-old Yang took up a job at his local driving range on the suggestion of a friend. The pay was a world away from the riches Woods was accumulating at the same age, but the job allowed him to eat and sleep on site and \u2013 fatefully for his American counterpart \u2013 put a club in his hands. Hooked from the first swing, Yang would break par for the first time three years later \u2013 his early progress entirely self-taught from pouring over tournament footage and instructional videos. It was a rate of improvement made even more impressive by the fact that he spent two years doing mandatory military service after his 21st birthday. Yang had never intended to take it any further than that, but that changed when he learned of the professional circuits in Korea and beyond. He turned semi-professional aged 23 in 1995 before making the jump to pro the following August. A maiden title would arrive six years later, but by 2007, he was still fighting to gain PGA Tour membership for the first time and was yet to win outside Asia. However, his seventh and latest victory in Shanghai, China was a standout, and not just because it marked his first on the European Tour. A star-studded field could not keep pace with Yang at the 2006 HSBC Champions \u2013 even Woods. The world No. 1 finished as runner-up, three shots adrift of the South Korean. It would not be the last time. \u2018Who the heck is Y.E. Yang?\u2019 Despite his giant-slaying efforts, Yang was still relatively unknown when he pitched up to PGA Tour qualifying school the following season. \u201cWho the heck is Y.E. Yang?\u201d AJ Montecinos replied when a fellow caddie texted him to say that a talented South Korean was in need of a bagman for the second stage. The Texas-based Montecinos would find out soon enough, as Yang won on the duo\u2019s first team-up. \u201cI\u2019d never been around a stronger golf mind, ever,\u201d Montecinos told CNN. \u201cHis mind was so simple, yet so strong. It blew me away how he never overthought, he never got in his own way \u2013 he just played golf and it was very impressive to watch.\u201d Yet as Yang clinched his first PGA Tour card and jetted across the US in 2008, Montecinos was forced to wait for his first taste of the circuit. The golfer had a different caddie setup for the final stage of qualifying and for his debut PGA Tour season, leaving Montecinos \u2013 without a bag to carry \u2013 \u201cstruggling\u201d to sell mortgage loans in San Antonio. Fate and faltering form would reunite the pair. Yang finished 157th on the money list for the season, forcing him back to qualifying school in 2009. Montecinos returned on Yang\u2019s request, and the duo edged through in nail-biting fashion to preserve the golfer\u2019s PGA Tour status. It was enough to convince Yang to bring Montecinos along this time round, and the decision reaped instant reward. Yang clinched his first PGA Tour title on his fourth start of the season at the Honda Classic to join K.J. Choi as the only South Koreans to win on the premier circuit. Into the Tiger\u2019s den Even so, Yang arrived at the PGA Championship that August as a rank outsider to lift the Wanamaker Trophy. Seven prior major appearances had resulted in just two made cuts, but Yang started with the confidence of a seasoned contender at Hazeltine to cruise into the weekend in tied-ninth, six shots behind runaway leader Woods. The chasing pack made up ground on moving day, and none more so than Yang, who shot a brilliant five-under 67. Not only did it rocket the underdog to within two shots of the American, but it also secured a final round pairing with him. Yang had bested Woods once before, though this was an entirely different stage. \u201cAt first when I saw the tee time, I was just really happy to be in the last group on the final day of a major,\u201d he later told reporters. \u201cFor a split second that was the first thought. And then second, my heart nearly pounded and exploded [from] being so nervous.\u201d Having failed in his bid to get to sleep early and woken several times in the night, Yang rose Sunday morning bleary-eyed and \u2013 as his agent relayed to Montecinos \u2013 still a little anxious. The caddie was on hand with some soothing words, but any concerns Montecinos had evaporated when the South Korean raced out of the blocks to head to the fifth tee level at the top with Woods. \u201cFrom those first few holes, I didn\u2019t know if he was going to win, but I knew he wasn\u2019t going to back down \u2013 and that\u2019s all I cared about,\u201d Montecinos said. \u201cI think being nervous is a good thing. But knowing how to harness that nervous energy and knowing how to utilize that for your good instead of for your harm, I think that\u2019s what makes Yang so special. \u201cI love staring down the best in the world, that\u2019s what really gets me going. I was a little nervous as well, but I just knew that neither of us were going to beat ourselves.\u201d Of course, that still left the small problem of defeating \u2013 as far as Montecinos is concerned \u2013 the greatest ever to play the game. It\u2019s not only Woods the golfer you\u2019re taking on, the caddie recalled \u2013 it\u2019s also the 50-person-deep crowds roaring his every shot, as well as an incommunicable \u201caura\u201d that even the game\u2019s greatest have buckled under. \u201cOh you definitely feel it. He had that kind of intimidation factor ever since he came on Tour,\u201d Montecinos, who played against Woods in high school, said. \u201cPlaying golf with Tiger in a major is like playing golf on the inside of a radio with every station going at the same time.\u201d Yet Yang refused to buckle, the conquering of his prior nerves perfectly summed up at the sixth hole when he was approached by a rules official ordering him to speed up his pace of play. \u201cNot me,\u201d a deadpan Yang replied, raising his finger to point at Woods. \u201cHim.\u201d Pandemonium As Woods wilted under a series of uncharacteristically sloppy putts, a remarkable chip-in eagle rewarded Yang with his first ever major lead at the 14th hole. The South Korean roared in delight, and would repeat the celebration four holes later \u2013 this time with his golf bag raised triumphantly above his head \u2013 after a stunning 18th approach was converted by a birdie putt for the championship. With Woods only able to bogey, compounding a disappointing three-over 75 final round, Yang was crowned a major champion and \u201cThe Tiger Killer\u201d nickname was born. \u201cI wasn\u2019t that nervous because it\u2019s a game of golf,\u201d Yang told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s not like \u2026 you\u2019re fighting against Tiger and he\u2019s going to bite you or swing at you with his nine-iron. \u201cI knew the odds were against me. I tried to be the least nervous I have ever been and went for broke. \u201cThe worst I could do was just lose to Tiger and go a few ranks down in the final scoreboard. Nobody is going to be really disappointed that I lose. So I really had nothing much at stake and that\u2019s how I played it,\u201d he added. Woods, having been denied a record-equaling fifth PGA Championship title, was magnanimous in defeat. \u201cI don\u2019t think he really missed a shot all day \u2026 I think he played beautifully,\u201d Woods said. \u201cIt was just a matter of time before an Asian-born player was going to win.\u201d That inevitability did little to quell the intensity of celebrations when Yang returned home. \u201cJust pandemonium,\u201d Montecinos said, picturing the hordes that flocked to the airport in the twilight hours to greet Yang in Korea soon after. When he touched down for the Hong Kong Open, Asia\u2019s first major champion was greeted by the sight of himself plastered on the side of a 10-storey building. \u201cIt was just unbelievable, very surreal,\u201d Montecinos added. \u201cTo be a part of history, I\u2019m very grateful.\u201d Japanese golfer Hideki Matsuyama\u2019s triumph at the 2021 Masters saw him join Yang in the exclusive winner\u2019s circle for Asian players at majors. It is a far less exclusive club on the women\u2019s side, with 35 LPGA major trophies handed out to South Korean champions alone. Cast of 2009 Yang and Montecinos parted ways a few years later but recently caught up at an event on the PGA Tour Champions, the senior circuit where Yang \u2013 now 52 \u2013 is currently chasing a first victory. \u201cIt was cool to see him,\u201d said Montecinos. \u201cIt was the relationship I miss with Yang \u2026 We had a lot of fun together.\u201d Yang\u2019s PGA Championship triumph remains his most recent at a Tour event, but his status as a former champion has ensured his near-permanent presence at the major. Bar 2020, Yang has competed at every edition since and is set to tee off for the 17th time at Valhalla in Kentucky on Thursday, 15 years after his famous victory. He will be joined by Montecinos\u2019 latest assignment, Chris Gotterup. The 24-year-old American stamped a last-minute ticket to Valhalla with his first PGA Tour victory at the inaugural Myrtle Beach Classic on Sunday. Completing the cast of 2009 is Woods, still chasing a fifth Wanamaker. After a record-breaking 24th consecutive cut at The Masters last month, the 48-year-old remains adamant that \u2013 despite his well-documented injury woes \u2013 he is capable of adding to his 15-major haul. Montecinos certainly isn\u2019t ruling it out. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should ever doubt that man, because he has done things in golf \u2013 and with a golf club \u2013 that nobody else has ever done,\u201d Montecinos said. \u201cYou cannot quantify the intestinal fortitude of a Tiger Woods. So in my mind, I believe that he will win again. I don\u2019t know where that will be, or if it will be a major, but I would not put it past him. \u201cI would not doubt him, because he is the reason that we play for as much money as we play for. Period. There is no other player out there that moves the needle like he does. So we all should be very grateful for Tiger.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/sport/ye-yang-pga-championship-tiger-woods-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "sports"}}

It\u2019s not clear precisely what McGregor was referring to, but this post, was viewed more than 19 million times on X, formerly known as Twitter. It was later followed by a series of tweets about immigration which were then circulated amongst Telegram channels, seen by CNN to have links to the far-right. As far back as 2022, McGregor had expressed his support for people protesting against immigration. The day after McGregor\u2019s war tweet, a stabbing outside a school in central Dublin left three children and an adult injured. Hours later, rioters with links to the far-right descended on the city. While local media later reported the alleged attacker was a naturalized Irish citizen who came to Ireland from Algeria in 2003, misinformation alleging the assailant was a foreign national had quickly spread online. Ciar\u00e1n O\u2019Connor, a senior analyst with the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a think tank that researches online hate and disinformation, told CNN that the far-right has grown in Ireland because of social media platforms such as X and Telegram which are commonly used by extremists. \u201cThe far-right are promoting McGregor as the voice of the people, taking advantage of his platforms to boost their ideology,\u201d O\u2019Connor told CNN, adding that\u00a0he believes\u00a0McGregor\u2019s \u201ctweets in the lead up to the riot were a call to action against illegal immigration.\u201d The Telegram channels that had circulated McGregor\u2019s declaration of war the night before the stabbing claimed\u00a0asylum seekers\u00a0posed an innate, existential threat to Ireland\u2019s citizens. According to the Irish government,\u00a0around 500 rioters spilled into the streets of Dublin and the rampage quickly turned violent. Police cars, buses and trams were set on fire. Rioters threw fireworks, flares and bottles injuring police officers, while shops were looted causing \u201ctens of millions\u201d of euros in damage. One protester could be seen on video holding a sign reading \u201cIrish Lives Matter,\u201d while others were heard chanting anti-immigrant slogans, as \u201cget them out\u201d reverberated around the nation\u2019s capital in a night of violence. Paul Murphy, a TD \u2013 a member of the Irish parliament \u2013 from the People Before Profit party, who has had members of the far-right protest outside his home in Dublin for his outspoken\u00a0support of refugees, told CNN that \u201cin terms of active members of the far-right, there\u2019s between 200 to 300 between all far-right organizations: national, freedom party, Ireland first \u2013 form a multitude of micro far-right parties.\u201d Despite Ireland\u2019s two far-right parties, the Irish National Party and the Irish Freedom Party, respectively received around\u00a00.2% and 0.3% of the vote in the 2020 general election, Murphy said the far-right are a small but growing minority. This comes after the Garda \u2013 as Ireland\u2019s police are known \u2013 told CNN there were 231 anti-immigration related public gatherings in 2023. After the riot on November 23, 2023, police\u00a0commissioner\u00a0Drew Harris said, \u201cWhat is clear is that people have been radicalized through social media,\u201d before describing rioters as \u201ca complete lunatic hooligan faction driven by far-right ideology.\u201d As riots raged in Dublin, McGregor, posted on X, \u201cYou reap what you sow.\u201d Local media reported this triggered a police investigation into the UFC star and others for allegedly \u201cinciting hatred online.\u201d The Garda told CNN that they would not comment on McGregor\u2019s case. McGregor also took to social media to suggest\u00a0that he might run for [Irish] President. The seriousness of his online claim remains unclear, though in a subsequent post McGregor positioned himself as providing \u201cfresh skin in the game.\u201d \u201cThese parties govern themselves vs govern the people \u2026 I listen. I support. I adapt. I have no affiliation/bias/favoritism toward any party. They would genuinely be held to account regarding the current sway of public feeling \u2026 It would not be me in power as President, people of Ireland. It would be me and you,\u201d said McGregor. McGregor did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. However, following the Dublin riot the 35-year-old told the Guardian in a statement that, \u201cWe Irish are known for our beautiful hearts, and we have a proud history of not accepting racism.\u201d \u2018The Notorious Conor McGregor\u2019 The rise of McGregor is one of the most famous rags-to-riches stories in sports. A working-class boy from Dublin, McGregor was driven by a desire to become world champion in a sport relatively unknown in Ireland. As he started winning fights, the MMA octagon became McGregor\u2019s colosseum. He entertained spectators with his precise boxing style and his quick wit charmed an ever-growing fan base. \u201cThe Notorious\u201d Conor McGregor brand was born and, before long, he was the first person in history to hold two UFC belts simultaneously,\u00a0rising to become the world\u2019s highest paid sport star in 2021, according to Forbes. Yet McGregor was dogged by accusations of sexual assault, which he has denied, while a string of defeats to Khabib Nurmagomedov, Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Dustin Poirier left the fighter with one\u00a0title victory in the last eight years. With his fighting career in flux, McGregor has turned his attention to sparring with people on social media, which has touched a nerve in Ireland\u2019s political establishment. Political analysts and far-right experts have told CNN that McGregor\u2019s unique brand of Irish patriotism that won him supporters as a fighter has mutated into a strand of \u201cfar-right\u201d Irish nationalism. \u201cFar-right figures who do promote ethnonationalism \u2013 of Ireland for the Irish \u2013 celebrate when McGregor is becoming more aligned with their brand of nationalism,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. McGregor has become \u201ca vocal anti-immigration influencer and is using his enormous reach and influence to encourage hostility and suspicion of migrants and asylum seekers,\u201d he added. McGregor has been accused by some Irish politicians of fanning the flames of discontent online, voicing his anger at Ireland\u2019s immigration policy and asking questions that strike at the core of Irish consciousness: does Ireland, a country with its long history of emigration, remain a country that welcomes people seeking refuge? \u201cI think these tweets are incredibly irresponsible for someone who has ten million followers on Twitter alone to be whipping up this level of poison and hate,\u201d Labour Justice spokesperson Aodh\u00e1n \u00d3 R\u00edord\u00e1in told RT\u00c9 News last year. McGregor has said he\u2019s being made a \u201cscapegoat.\u201d The former UFC champion appears to have picked his corner, in the fight for Ireland\u2019s soul, but whether he is willingly or unwillingly platforming \u201cfar-right\u201d views remains unclear. \u201cWhen he first came to prominence in 2012, he got attention by acting like a clown \u2013 and people received him well,\u201d Ewan MacKenna, who authored the book \u201cChaos is a Friend of Mine: The Life and Crimes of Conor McGregor,\u201d told CNN. \u201cHe will become whatever the crowd wants him to be and he molds himself into whatever brings him the most attention, and with politics, it would be similar.\u201d McGregor has previously claimed he regularly deletes his posts on X for \u201cpersonal\u201d reasons but has also said: \u201cMy statements, widely publicised, stand.\u201d \u2018We all go to war\u2019 McGregor\u2019s UFC slogan was once: \u201cWhen one of us go to war, we all go to war,\u201d and the MMA fighter has continued to evoke war imagery in recent months. \u201cMcGregor, when he first came onto the [MMA] scene, he used his sense of Irishness to portray an image of a fighting Irish warrior, but in the last couple of months, he has pivoted this towards ethno-nationalism and this idea that Ireland must protect itself from refugees,\u201d said O\u2019Connor. In a later post, now deleted by McGregor, the fighter reacted to footage of a bus of asylum seekers, writing: \u201cPeople of the community are not told who these men are. Or why they are here. This is what I mean when I say we are at war. You cannot expect the people of Ireland to tolerate this. We will not.\u201d In a separate, now deleted post on X, the UFC star said: \u201cDo not let any Irish property be took over unannounced. Evaporate said property. It\u2019s a war.\u201d Since November 2018 , there have been a number of instances when properties or locations linked,\u00a0 to the housing of people seeking asylum or international protection were set on fire, according to analysis by Irish media. The UFC star, in a now deleted post, said: \u201cI stand with the people of the East Wall,\u201d in reference to protests which started in Dublin\u2019s East Wall district in November 2022 over plans to house refugees in a disused office block. McGregor\u2019s tweet was then circulated widely in Telegram channels with links to the far-right. Ireland, a country of just over five million people, saw 141,600 immigrants arrive on its shores in the year leading up to April 2023 \u2013 the highest figure in 16 years with some attracted by its strong economic performance (9.4% real GDP growth in 2022), according to the Central Statistics Office Ireland (CSO). In 2020, Ireland was ranked in the Migration Policy Index\u2019s top 10 of countries for having \u201ca comprehensive approach to integration, which fully guarantees equal rights, opportunities and security for immigrants and citizens.\u201d But for many ordinary workers,\u00a0the benefits are failing to reach their pockets\u00a0and they struggle are struggling to afford high housing prices and rents. This leaves many without a stake in society, or a home to live in, and so Ireland is often seen as a nation of exiles, with more than 64,000 people leaving its shores to try their hand at a life elsewhere over the same time period. Matthew Donoghue, a professor in social policy at University College Dublin, told CNN socio-economic inequality can create a \u201csense of insecurity that the far-right have become adept at exploiting for their own gain, scapegoating people and groups who are facing exactly the same pressures.\u201d \u201cThe pressures people feel can be a result of complex political, economic and social factors but instead the far-right offer a simple - but incorrect - narrative of blame,\u201d he added. In November, McGregor shared, before unsharing, an X post by anti-immigration Irish influencer Mick O\u2019Keefe about residents in rural Ireland putting up a checkpoint to deter asylum seekers from entering local areas. O\u2019Keefe regularly writes to McGregor on X, calling him \u201cPresident McGregor.\u201d O\u2019Keefe did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. AI-generated images of McGregor have also circulated online, showing him bare-chested, holding a rifle and leading a mob of armed Irishmen. In one video posted on X, Keith Woods, an Irish anti-immigration influencer, lambasts Ireland\u2019s new hate speech laws, claiming they are a way to silence people speaking out against immigration. The same video then shows an AI-generated image of McGregor wearing a crown on his head, wrapped in an Irish tricolor. Woods has appeared on far-right agitator Nick Fuentes\u2019 \u201cAmerica First\u201d show. During a separate show, Fuentes \u2013 an American White nationalist and Holocaust denier \u2013 said that McGregor should \u201crise up\u201d and \u201csalvage [Ireland] because it\u2019s going to be either the Irish or it\u2019s going to be the Blacks,\u201d before adding: \u201cOnly one side is going to come out of this thing alive.\u201d McGregor, who follows Woods on X, has liked his posts in the past, including one where Woods quoted Irish 1916 patriot Padraig Pearse saying, \u201cIreland belongs to the Irish.\u201d The phrase has become the new slogan of the far-right Irish National Party, for which Woods has been seen canvassing and holding the party\u2019s banner. Woods did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Harnessing social media As recently as 2019, Foreign Policy said that Ireland was one of Europe\u2019s \u201clast countries without extreme nationalists in parliament.\u201d But the Dublin riots and subsequent protests have cast the spotlight on the emergence of a new right-wing strain of politics and its amplification on social media. Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, told CNN that \u201cfar-right groups in Ireland are harnessing Twitter (now known as X) to spread their messages in the same way far-right groups do so in other parts of the EU.\u201dBut she added: \u201cIt is true that Ireland\u2019s far right is less developed than in places like Germany and France, where there are rising political parties of this persuasion, or in Italy, Sweden, and other countries where the far right is part of the governing majority.\u201dDonoghue added, \u201cthere is a larger (yet small) base of committed activists using social media, especially that they are able to organize more effectively than before. However, it is very important to note that they are roundly rejected by the vast majority of the Irish population.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/sport/conor-mcgregor-figurehead-far-right-ireland-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_12_sport_lionel-messi-mls-rule-change-spt-intl", "text": "Lionel Messi appeared to cut a frustrated figure on the sidelines when a new Major League Soccer rule prevented him from immediately returning to the pitch following an injury check. With Inter Miami 2-0 down against Montr\u00e9al on Saturday, Messi was off the pitch when his team needed someone to take a free-kick. The Argentine had received on-field treatment moments earlier in the first half following a tackle from defender George Campbell, which had led to the free-kick being awarded, and then walked off the pitch. The situation brought the MLS\u2019 \u201cOff-Field Treatment Rule,\u201d introduced in April, into play. According to the rules: \u201cIf a player with a suspected injury remains on the ground for more than 15 seconds, the referee will stop play and wave the medical crew onto the field to evaluate the player. \u201cWhen safe, the player will be removed from the field and remain off the field for a minimum of two minutes for further assessment and treatment.\u201d Unable to return to the pitch, Messi turned towards a television camera on the sidelines, shook his head and said in Spanish: \u201cWith these type of rules \u2026\u201d The moment has been widely shared on social media. The 36-year-old was not missed during the free kick, however, as Mat\u00edas Rojas took it and scored in the top-right corner to reduce the deficit to 2-1, sparking a comeback. Miami eventually celebrated a 3-2 victory, the team\u2019s fifth consecutive league win which extends its unbeaten run to seven games. Luis Su\u00e1rez and Benjamin Cremaschi were the other scorers on a night when Messi did not find the net. After the match, Miami coach Gerardo Martino told reporters that there were rules that \u201cmust be revised.\u201d According to the rule book, the two-minute rule would not have taken effect had Campbell received a yellow or red card for the foul on Messi. \u201cExceptions to the Off-Field Treatment Rule include instances of potential head injury, goalkeeper injuries, serious medical events, and fouls resulting in yellow or red cards,\u201d the rule states. \u201cIn Leo\u2019s situation, he was clearly fouled,\u201d Martino said, per ESPN. \u201cThe player deserved a yellow card, which would mean Messi would\u2019ve never left the field for two minutes. \u201cAs I understand it, the team that suffered the foul was punished. With these new rule changes, there are situations that must be revised. The infraction was clear and was a yellow card, and ultimately it was us that lost Leo for two minutes.\u201d CNN has contacted the MLS for comment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/sport/lionel-messi-mls-rule-change-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "sport_garia-luxury-golf-carts-road-legal-intl", "text": "From the blooming azaleas of Augusta National to the breathtaking lighthouse at Turnberry in Scotland, golf is renowned for its natural beauty. The same cannot be said, however, for the sport\u2019s primary mode of transport. But one Danish company is on a mission to put the art in golf cart. Copenhagen-based Garia is the self-described \u201cworld\u2019s first and only\u201d luxury golf and leisure car brand (that\u2019s\u00a0car, not cart), whose aims to regenerate the traditional golf buggy have led to ambitions that lie far beyond the confines of the 18-hole course. Such goals seemed a long drive away in 2005 when Anders Lynge, still in design school, met Soren Bak Hansen during an internship at a car company. A short while later, having spotted a gap in the market, the duo founded Garia. \u201cWhen it came to the golf cart 18 years ago, they all looked the same \u2013 there weren\u2019t any serious high-end products out there,\u201d Lynge told CNN. \u201cIf you lived in a high-end community \u2013 paying hundreds of thousands of dollars of membership fees, a $10 million house, whatever you had \u2013 the whole lifestyle of these people, from their cars to their clothes, watches; everything was super personalized. \u201cWe thought it was strange that they all had the same type of golf cart \u2026 So the idea behind Garia was basically to say, \u2018How can we make a product that fulfils the lifestyle of these people, that has the same sort of quality that they\u2019re used to from every other product they surround themselves with?\u2019 \u201cThat really changed our focus to say, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s do that: the ultimate golf car.\u2019\u201d Reinventing the wheel(s) Achieving that aim was easier said than done when the team was effectively tasked with reinventing the wheel and \u2013 as Lynge remarked \u2013 an unattractive one at that. There are several reasons for the uniformity of the traditional golf buggy, narrow and vertical in shape, Lynge explained. The universal requirement of having to fit onto golf courses and their various cart paths \u2013 needing to perform 180-degree turns in a cul-de-sac \u2013 limits design creativity. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to do a new bicycle or a new motorcycle,\u201d Lynge said. \u201cYou\u2019re so heavily constrained from a technical standpoint. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst kind of shape you can have \u2013 it doesn\u2019t look very dynamic. You want something that\u2019s sort of Lamborghini-shaped \u2013 very low and wide \u2013 but the golf cart is the exact opposite.\u201d Yet solutions emerged: extending the wheelbase, enlarging the cabin, unprecedented 12-inch alloy wheels without hubcaps that replaced the traditional \u201cdeep dish\u201d look, and a double wishbone front suspension \u2013 common in sports cars \u2013 to boost handling. Garia\u2019s vehicles may look bigger and more \u201cmuscular\u201d than the average golf cart, but the proportions are the same as any other standard buggy. This is simply a visual \u201ctrick\u201d \u2013 and far from the only one. A storage box tucked behind the seat serves to lift the beltline, slashing cabin space to give it more of a car feel, while accent lines and wheels pushed out to the edges help ground the vehicle. Lynge toyed extensively with positive and negative space, taking inspiration from Porsche\u2019s 911 to use convex and concave shapes across the car. It makes warehouse storage a \u201cnightmare,\u201d but the visual payoffs are worth the trouble, Lynge says. Elite company In fact, it is rare that any two Garias look exactly the same. Using an online configurator inspired by Nike\u2019s shoe customizer, prospective buyers can hand-pick almost every aspect of their vehicle; from body and roof color \u2013 44 options and rising \u2013 to wheels and interior features like refrigerators and cup holders. There are millions of possible combinations, Lynge insists. German luxury car modification firm Mansory, which works with clients including Bentley and Lamborghini, provides a range of accessories and even a full carbon-fiber car. Other collaborations have included German Bugatti supplier Kussmaul, which Garia paired with to build a single, special edition chrome car capable of doing 0 to 40 kilometers per hour (25 miles per hour) in less than two seconds. Another involved Mercedes, whom Lynge first made contact with after winning a competition run by the car giant to design a golf cart. Lynge took the prize ceremony event as an opportunity to pitch a dream that would be realized in 2016 \u2013 a Garia golf car inspired by Mercedes-Benz Style. Retailing at just under \u20ac80,000 ($86,000), the fully carbon-fiber car had twice the battery life and twice the power of a typical Garia, topping out at speeds of 69 kilometers per hour (43 miles per hour). \u201cReally expensive \u2026 super exclusive, but also the coolest golf car you\u2019ll ever see,\u201d Lynge said. Out of bounds Its scarcity means only a select few will have been seen on European roads. Making street legal models was always the plan for Garia, but achieving certification is no easy feat. Extensive \u2013 and therefore expensive \u2013 safety and crash testing is required to gain road-status, and requirements differ across regions. While Europe allows for greater speeds, the US employs a strict 40 kilometers per hour (25 miles per hour) legal limit on such vehicles. But that did not discourage Lynge, who saw the prevalence of golf communities in the US as a potentially lucrative market for Garia. The company was sold by the Lars Larsen Group to American golf and utility giant Club Car in 2022. The base version of Garia\u2019s two-seater golf car \u2013 without any customization or additional features \u2013 has a manufacturer suggested retail price of \u20ac14,939 ($16,100), with the four-seater edition starting from \u20ac20,189 ($21,770). The street legal variants for both Europe and the US come in at \u20ac18,959 ($20,440) for the two-seat model and rise to \u20ac21,219 ($22,880) for four seats. \u201cWe very much felt that these cars are so fun to drive and they are fun to interact with,\u201d Lynge said. \u201cI don\u2019t know the exact percentage, but a great part of our cars are also bought by people who don\u2019t play golf. They are just in a holiday house.\u201d As he looks to the future, Lynges envisions Garia branching out of golf and into the leisure space, becoming \u201cmore-and-more car-like\u201d with each passing year, making vehicles suited to urban mobility.  \u201cIf you drive around London, how fast do you even need to go? Forty-three miles per hour is plenty of opportunity, right? There is some weird sort of space there as the market changes into full electric where everything is sort of up in the air,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going to land, but I feel like we have some interesting lessons with us in this journey we\u2019ve been on that puts us in a good position to do mobility, maybe in a wider sense, than just golf.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/sport/garia-luxury-golf-carts-road-legal-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_04_26_sport_aya-nakamura-france-culture-wars-paris-2024-spt-intl", "text": "Aya Nakamura was born in the former French colony of Mali, raised in France and is\u00a0widely considered\u00a0the most streamed female Francophone artist in the world. The 28-year-old,\u00a0as well as being Malian,\u00a0is a French citizen, and a multiple-platinum-selling pop star who was brought up in the Parisian suburbs. However,\u00a0ahead of Paris 2024, Nakamura finds herself at the\u00a0center\u00a0of France\u2019s culture wars. Amid widespread\u00a0rumors\u00a0the singer would\u00a0perform at the Games\u2019 Opening Ceremony, singing an Edith Piaf song,\u00a0some members of France\u2019s far-right have questioned\u00a0whether she embodies French heritage, values and identity.\u00a0Piaf is a key figure in France\u2019s musical \u2013 and national \u2013 identity. \u201cThere\u2019s no way Aya. This is Paris, not the market\u00a0in\u00a0Bamako,\u201d said fringe\u00a0and extreme\u00a0far-right group Les Natifs (Natives) on X, formerly known\u00a0as Twitter, in March, referring to Mali\u2019s capital. Nakamura has defended herself on social media, saying on X: \u201cI\u2019m becoming the number one state subject in debates\u00a0\u2026but what do I really owe you all? Nothing.\u201d The singer has received support from Rachida Dati, France\u2019s Minister of Culture, who spoke out in defence of Nakamura, saying \u201cbe careful of the pretext of attacking someone out of pure racism.\u201d Paris 2024\u2019s organizing committee told CNN: \u201cWe were very shocked by the racist attacks against Aya Nakamura in recent days. We offer our full support to the most listened-to French artist in the world.\u201d Whether Nakamura will perform at the Olympics\u2019 opening ceremony is still unconfirmed, with the Paris 2024 organizing committee telling CNN that they\u00a0\u201cwon\u2019t be confirming or denying\u201d\u00a0any rumors or reports, to \u201cleave room for surprises\u201d on the day. CNN has reached out to Nakamura but she declined to\u00a0be interviewed\u00a0on the matter. \u2018She contributes to French culture\u2019 However, many others in France are all too keen to comment on this cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. Far-right politician Marion Mar\u00e9chal,\u00a0who is the niece\u00a0of far-right National Rally party leader\u00a0Marine Le Pen and a member of the\u00a0Reconqu\u00eate\u00a0party, told French\u00a0television stations BMFTV and Europe 1\u00a0that Nakamura\u00a0\u201cdoes not sing in French,\u201d referencing the blend of Parisian and African\u00a0derived slang\u00a0that often feature in her lyrics. \u201cI think that the people who criticize her actually don\u2019t accept that she embodies France,\u201d\u00a0French activist Rokhaya Diallo told CNN. \u201cThe\u00a0slang she uses is used by young people and a lot of young French people use slang.\u201d Nakamura often uses a mix of verlan and African derived slang from languages such as Bambara, from her birth country Mali,\u00a0in her music. Her number one hit song\u00a0\u201cDjadja,\u201d\u00a0contains the lyric \u201cle monde est tit-pe\u201d \u2013 the world is small \u2013 with word \u2018tit-pe\u2019 inverting the French word \u2018petit.\u2019 Verlan, a type of French slang named after\u00a0the inversion of the French word \u2018l\u2019envers\u2019 \u2013 meaning backwards \u2013 originates from the outskirts of Paris known as \u2018la cit\u00e9\u2019 (the suburbs)\u00a0that have had\u00a0large\u00a0immigrant population. At the inauguration of the\u00a0Olympic Aquatics Centre\u00a0earlier this month, French President Emanuel Macron\u00a0said that Nakamura \u201cspeaks to a good number of our compatriots\u201d and claimed that \u201cthese\u00a0games and ceremonies should reflect us, and she contributes to French culture, to French music.\u201d \u201cI want to defend here these choices and defend the fact that there must be artistic freedom and that politics should not interfere,\u201d added Macron. In an interview with France Inter,\u00a0Macron\u2019s political rival Le Pen, known for her right-wing views, claimed that the President was seeking to \u201coutrage\u201d and \u201chumiliate the French people\u201d when asked whether she thinks Nakamura opening the games would be a\u00a0good symbol. When asked to further explain why this choice would be a humiliation, Le Pen responded \u201cshe does not sing in French, or a foreign language, she sings nonsense.\u201d Speaking to CNN, Professor of Political Science at the University of Nice,\u00a0Vincent\u00a0Martigny, said that\u00a0while\u00a0there are those who believe it is right to promote minorities and their role in French culture, there are others, who hold more traditional views, which he terms as racist in relation to the country\u2019s colonial past. 1998 World Cup There have been moments of\u00a0perceived\u00a0unity in France\u2019s past, notably when the men\u2019s national soccer team won the 1998 World Cup. That triumph helped popularise the slogan \u201cBlack, Blanc, Beur\u201d \u2013 Black, White, Arab\u00a0\u00a0\u2013\u00a0amid a push for unity and inclusion. Beur\u2019 is verlan for the French word \u2018arabe.\u2019 France\u2019s World Cup winning team of 1998\u00a0was made up of a\u00a0diverse\u00a0group\u00a0of players,\u00a0not only of European descent but also from the ex-colonies of France\u00a0and other countries.\u00a0Many thought\u00a0at the time\u00a0that the 1998 team was a sign of a truly integrated, multi-cultural France. But notable social and cultural divisions have emerged in France in recent years. There have been\u00a0multiple bans and restrictions against Islamic dress. The nationwide ban on\u00a0public\u00a0schoolchildren wearing abayas,\u00a0was\u00a0denounced as an \u201cIslamophobic campaign\u201d by\u00a0one\u00a0politician\u00a0on the left.\u00a0Athletes have been banned\u00a0from wearing a hijab while competing representing France\u00a0at the Paris\u00a0Olympic Games. Then there have been multiple protests and riots over police brutality leading to the death of\u00a0some French inhabitants of North and West African heritage\u00a0from the suburbs of Paris, fueling backlash over policing methods in marginalized communities. Nakamura\u2019s\u00a0birth\u00a0country\u00a0of Mali is one of the many\u00a0former\u00a0French colonies. There are millions of French citizens, like Nakamura, who are either themselves immigrants or descendants of immigrants from\u00a0nations formerly colonized by France. These days France\u00a0finds itself embroiled in a very public debate over the recognition and acceptance of its immigrants as the country continues to reckon with its colonial history. Professor Martigny believes that the\u00a0nationalist\u00a0party is \u201cstronger than ever\u201d and that nationalists in France are \u201cmore nationalist\u201d and more open with their views today than they were in the past. Activist Diallo also believes that France is struggling to see itself \u201cas it is\u201d and recognize non-White individuals as fully French. \u201cDespite her successes, despite her undeniable achievements, we still think that it\u2019s not an honor for us to have such a woman represent us,\u201d Diallo told CNN, referring to Nakamura. \u2018The Great Replacement\u2019 theory Political scientist Oliver Roy, who is Professor\u00a0at the EUI School of Transnational Governance, told CNN that a common belief that could be fuelling the culture wars in France is an ideology\u00a0expressed\u00a0\u201cnot just [by] the extreme right, but also part of the traditional centre right\u201d known as \u201cthe great replacement.\u201d He describes\u00a0the term\u00a0as \u201cthe idea that there is a new population coming from the south, which is replacing the old traditional, French population.\u201d However, he maintains that this fear \u201cis not supported by demography, [or] by statistics, and is, of course, very ideological.\u201d According to Martigny, France\u2019s cultural divisions are amplified on social media by both extremes of the political spectrum. \u201cBecause of the social networks, public debates are more violent on these issues than they used to be,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a theatre for the expression of extremely strong minded, sometimes racist, very often offensive comments on Twitter, on X, and on other social networks,\u201d added Martigny. \u201cYou have a lot of X accounts who are really, really, really pro far-right. And so they played a role in discussing these issues and making it a controversy. And then this controversy is exported to the traditional media.\u201d \u2018Show a very optimistic face for France\u2019 As Nakamura was targeted by fringe and extreme far-right groups as well as far-right politicians, in an interview\u00a0with BMFTV and RMC,\u00a0Macron said that \u201cthe reactions shocked me \u2026 there\u00a0were\u00a0truly racist reactions.\u201d However,\u00a0Martigny says he sees\u00a0Macron\u2019s condemnation of the attacks as racist as an attempt to balance the scales after the passing of\u00a0what the professor called\u00a0a \u201cvery restrictive law on immigration\u201d a few months ago. In December, Macron passed a controversial bill calling for tougher immigration that was endorsed by the far-right, and rejected by many in his own camp. Politicians such as Le Pen hailed the legislation as an \u201cideological victory\u201d whilst French health Minister, Aurelien Rousseau resigned in protest.\u00a0It included many amendments tightening immigration laws, one of which dictated children born to foreign parents on French soil would no longer become automatic French citizens but would have to apply for citizenship. \u201cHe needs to make that forgotten in a certain way by showing that he has a sense of balance on these issues,\u201d\u00a0Martigny states. By promoting Nakamura, Martigny believes that Macron\u2019s ambitions may have been to \u201cshow a very optimistic face for France.\u201d \u201c[There are] very strong cultural wars in France revolving around pop stars, and the type of pop stars that you can mobilize or the type of artists that you can mobilize when you want to unite the country.\u201d With less than 100 days to go until the Olympics, many hope Paris 2024 will give France the opportunity to show unity. However, the heated reactions to Nakamura hints at a more pessimistic outlook.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/26/sport/aya-nakamura-france-culture-wars-paris-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "sports"}}

The Palestinian Football Association (PFA) had called for a vote to ban Israel before Infantino made the announcement over accusations that the IFA had violated FIFA rules during the continued war in Gaza. \u201cDue to the obvious sensitivity of these matters, FIFA will mandate, as of now, independent legal expertise to analyse and assess the three requests made by the Palestinian Football Association and ensure that the statutes and regulations of FIFA are applied in the correct way,\u201d Infantino said. \u201cIn order to ensure a fair and due process, of course, this legal assessment will have to allow for input and claims of both member associations.\u201d Infantino said the results and recommendations would be forwarded to all FIFA Council members before attending an extraordinary meeting that will be scheduled to take place before July 20, where the PFA\u2019s proposal to suspend Israel from international matches will be addressed. Prior to Infantino\u2019s announcement, the PFA President Jibril Rajoub had called for immediate action from FIFA. \u201cAs I speak to you today, the Palestinian people, including the Palestinian football family, are enduring an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe. We are witness\u00a0[to]\u00a0a live televised genocide unfolding in Gaza,\u201d Rajoub said. \u201cI ask you to stand on the right side of history and vote now. The suffering of millions, including thousands of footballers, deserves as much. If not now, then when? Mr President, the ball is in your court.\u201d Rajoub went on to call for FIFA \u201cto temporarily suspend the IFA as a member of FIFA with immediate effect.\u201d Jordan Football Association general secretary Samar Nassar backed Rajoub, saying: \u201cWe are not here to deliberate on the human tragedy. We are here to take a vote, the world is witnessing what FIFA will do today.\u201d \u201cFIFA has stood on the right side of history before when it banned Yugoslavia, when it banned Russia, and when it banned South Africa for more than 20 years. And I think we have a role to take today,\u201d Nassar added. Reacting to the calls for the IFA\u2019s ban, the association\u2019s President Shino Moshe Zuares said: \u201cToday, maybe more than ever, I believe that football must be a key element in healing the fractures and wounds, helping us and everyone to recover. Yet once again, we are facing a cynical, political and hostile attempt by the Palestinian Association to harm Israeli football.\u201d \u201cMake no mistake, the IFA never violated rules set by FIFA and UEFA and will never do so in the future,\u201d he added. \u201cSeven months after the terrible day, when football matches cannot be played in large parts of Israel, north and south, and over 130 Israelis are still being held in Gaza, it is injustice that even in these circumstances we find ourselves fighting for our basic right to be part of the game.\u201d In his closing remarks on the debate, Infantino said: \u201cLike everyone, I was extremely, extremely shocked by what happened on October 7 in Israel. And like anyone else, I was extremely, extremely shocked, and am extremely shocked at what\u2019s happening in Gaza.\u201d \u201cI pray for all those people who suffer the unimaginable \u2026 and I want, like all of you, just one thing: peace.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/sport/fifa-to-take-legal-advice-on-calls-to-suspend-israel-football-association/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "sports"}}

But, despite its small home, Ewing\u2019s vision of creating a fan-owned club, steeped in values of diversity and community with ambitions of reaching the Scottish Premier League, has attracted more than $300,000 in investment from more than 1,000 owners around the world, far outstripping the annual running costs of about $58,000, he says. Among those owners include an NBA player, an NBA coach and a\u00a0players\u2019 union executive\u00a0as well as soccer players in the US\u2019 National Women Super League (NWSL). Investors in 49 US states have bought in \u2013 Wyoming is the only state pending on the list, he says. \u201cA community club, most people would think, is a local community bound by a certain geography,\u201d says Ewing. \u201cBut I think that today when we have internet, we have social media, we have an app as well that promotes fan engagement, I feel like a community can be just shared ideals and shared values, and it can be global.\u201d \u2018Entrepreneurial spirit\u2019 Visiting Scotland and learning about the country\u2019s history was an \u201camazing\u201d experience for Mujtaba Elgoodah, one of the club\u2019s lead investors, he remembers. More used to basketball than soccer, Elgoodah was the manager of team development for the Golden State Warriors when they won the 2022 NBA title and is now part of the National Basketball Players\u2019 Association executive leadership team. But, when braving the bitterly cold Scottish weather to visit the club in February, he discovered \u201cthere is nothing like a good football match,\u201d Elgoodah tells CNN Sport. \u201cJust seeing the intensity and even picking up different slang words that the crowd was throwing out there was amazing too,\u201d he adds. Elgoodah had been intrigued by the Braves\u2019 story and ethos when he happened across their story on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, last year. He set about assembling a group of investors who could appreciate both soccer\u2019s potential for growth and the importance of community alongside his longtime investment partner Nassir Criss, a serial entrepreneur and venture capitalist. Together, they involved NWSL\u2019s Kansas City Current stars Elizabeth Ball, Kristen Hamilton and Hailie Mace with their wealth of soccer knowledge, and introduced Boston Celtics performance coach Isaiah Covington to Ewing after he had also noticed the club\u2019s story on social media. \u201cI didn\u2019t grow up around soccer,\u201d Covington recalls. \u201cBut in the last few years, I have a host of nieces and nephews and that\u2019s all they play now.\u201d Though still nowhere near as popular as American football or basketball, soccer is the fastest-growing sport in the US and the most popular choice for adults under the age of 30. As a high school sport alone, it has grown by almost 300% in the last 40 years. \u201cYou see \u2026 all these celebrities owning football clubs, it\u2019s kind of the new wave that people are on,\u201d Hamilton says. \u201cAnd so I think that that\u2019s been a really huge, powerful movement in the US saying, \u2018Hey, you know, we can\u2019t own an NFL team, but we can own a small football team.\u2019\u201d With its idea for lots of small investors helping it achieve huge ambitions, the Braves embodies an American style \u201centrepreneurial spirit,\u201d Criss tells CNN Sport. \u201cHow do we take something new that no one\u2019s ever really heard of, this wee club with massive ambitions to being a global franchise and pour in resources, community, people to actually accelerate that on a very big scale,\u201d he says. \u2018Flipping the narrative\u2019 As more and more money pours into soccer, the gap between fans and owners has become a cavern at many clubs. In the battle for soccer\u2019s soul, the two groups are often pitted against each other \u2013 the fans as representing the history and traditions of the sport, the owners cast as turning clubs into commercial entities or vehicles for sportswashing. Against this backdrop, fan ownership has emerged as somewhat of a utopian panacea for some fans. While it is still an unusual model in the UK, particularly in the English Premier League and Championship where clubs operate at huge losses, the Braves are not the first to pursue this goal. They were set up as a company limited by shares in 2022 meaning that fans can buy into it, and expect to file their first set of accounts in October.\u00a0Ewing founded a previous attempt at this ownership model from 2019 to 2021 but dissolved it before ever trading, he says. In Scotland, fans have become majority owners at topflight clubs St Mirren, Motherwell and Heart of Midlothian in recent years while several others, including Rangers and Celtic, count fans among their minority owners. In German soccer culture, meanwhile, the 50+1 concept of fan majority ownership is deeply entrenched thereby giving fans more of a say in the running of clubs, a model Ewing says he hopes to eventually emulate. But fan ownership isn\u2019t easy, namely working out how to marshal hundreds of opinions into some sort of coherent opinion. Ewing, who doesn\u2019t take a salary from the club, admits that managing expectations has proved challenging \u201cbecause people think they can just say, okay, let\u2019s do x, y, z.\u201d \u201cWith the best intentions in the world, it\u2019s maybe not as easy as that, but I think as well, the big thing for me is that people get to love the highs and the lows.\u201d The Braves have an app and Discord channel, helping to foster this sense of community and allowing fan owners to have a voice on the direction of the club. Fans picked the club\u2019s name, logo and the name of its ground \u2013 Alliance Park. Allowing fans this ownership over the team is proving infectious, its investors are finding. \u201cAnytime I ever post about the Braves \u2026 people will DM me and be like, \u201c\u2019Who\u2019s this team \u2026 and how do I get involved?\u2019\u201d Ball says. Such a project is a marked difference from Ewing\u2019s original venture, Edusport Academy, which he established in 2011, intending to provide a place for promising young soccer players, mostly from France, to hone their craft and learn English. As time went by, the academy\u2019s first team started playing in the Scottish soccer leagues and separated to form the Caledonian Braves in 2019. Now, as the Braves continue to grow, it has set its sights on rising up through the leagues but in a sustainable way that preserves the club for years to come. \u201c(We\u2019re) flipping the narrative that you don\u2019t have to be Tom Brady or Matthew McConaughey or Ryan Reynolds,\u201d says Ewing. \u201cYou can be anyone really from anywhere and you can also own a football club for as little as $100.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/29/sport/caledonian-braves-american-investors-scotland-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_sport_eton-harrow-lords-cricket-spt-intl", "text": "At Lord\u2019s Cricket Ground in the quiet, well-heeled streets of northwest London, different architectural eras collide together in a mishmash of mismatching styles representing the old and the new. A grand 134-year-old pavilion, its sandy brown stone fa\u00e7ade covered in ornate embellishments, sits at one end, staring at a futuristic glass media center across the pitch which balances on white columns and peers like a giant oblong eye over the ground. And never is that collision between the old and new more evident than when Lord\u2019s, the self-styled \u201chome\u201d of cricket and one of its most prestigious grounds, hosts the annual schoolboys fixture Eton vs. Harrow. The fixture \u2013 in which two of England\u2019s most exclusive and expensive boys\u2019 private schools play one another \u2013 is older than the oldest brick at this ground, first played in 1805 before Lord\u2019s was even at its current location. But it has become increasingly controversial and somewhat emblematic of the attempts of British institutions to reconcile their pasts with the present after it was axed from Lord\u2019s schedule by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which owns the ground, in 2022. That provoked an uproar from its members and the warring factions eventually reached a compromise in which Lord\u2019s would host both the Eton vs. Harrow and Oxford vs.Cambridge fixtures for another five years, as well as the finals of the UK\u2019s school and university cricket competitions, before another consultation with members in 2027. Eton and Harrow both said in separate statements to CNN that it was a \u201chuge privilege\u201d to play at Lord\u2019s again this year and thanked the MCC. For those criticizing the fixture, it is steeped in elitism and serves only to perpetuate stereotypes that cricket is an upper-class sport, one in which public schoolboys play annually on its most hallowed ground where the England Women have never played a Test. \u201cGuaranteeing a tiny number of schoolboys the right to play at Lord\u2019s every year when millions of children are denied that right is completely unacceptable,\u201d said the Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket in its 2023 report, which examined inequalities and discrimination within the English game. However, for those attending Friday\u2019s match \u2013 mostly relatives of the schoolboys on the pitch or alumni who have attended this fixture for decades \u2013 it is an important piece of history to preserve, a cherished tradition and another victim of \u201ccancel culture.\u201d \u2018Part of the season\u2019 The Romantic poet Lord Byron played in the inaugural Eton vs. Harrow match more than two centuries ago. Afterwards, he wrote, \u201cWe were most of us very drunk and we went together to the Haymarket Theatre where we kicked up a row, as you may suppose when so many Harrovians and Etonians meet in one place.\u201d On Friday, cheers and chants began from the moment the two teams walked out onto the sun-drenched pitch. \u201cLet\u2019s go, oi, oi, oi!\u201d shouted the Etonians as they rose to their feet from the first ball, shouting, clapping, and even waving their shoes in their air, as is tradition. In another section of the stands, the Harrovians reciprocated with a standing ovation at the first boundary, before the Etonians launched into a rendition of the \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d theme song when a player called Jack Sparrow bowled his first over. \u201cThe atmosphere today has been incredible; everyone has been really friendly. I\u2019ve never known such a convivial atmosphere before,\u201d Mark McCullen, who attended Eton and whose son is now at the school, told CNN Sport. There is no qualification procedure for the fixture. Eton and Harrow play at Lord\u2019s because they have played here for 219 years, because they are schools that are held aloft on their centuries-old history and which still churn out a disproportionate number of the British establishment. Twenty of the country\u2019s 45 Prime Ministers, including two of its last five, went to Eton; another seven Prime Ministers went to Harrow. It costs \u00a349,998 ($62,620) per year to attend Eton, and \u00a350,550 ($63,310) to attend Harrow, though both offer bursaries and scholarships for a small number of students. For many spectators, this fixture is an intrinsic part of the schools\u2019 respective histories, a tradition that remains from a time when debutantes making their entrance into upper-class society had to attend it, along with Wimbledon and the Ascot Races. Times may have changed but the tradition remains, making it almost sacrosanct for those who observe it and out-of-touch for those who don\u2019t. \u201cI think it\u2019s rather disappointing that there are a lot of people at the MCC whothink this fixture should be abolished because it\u2019s elitist,\u201d Harry Wells, an OldEtonian who first came to this fixture 57 years ago and is this year supporting hisfriend\u2019s son in the Harrow squad, told CNN. \u201cI think our country is going to sell itself down the river if it abolishes everything we\u2019ve held dear over the millennia.\u201d As late as the 1960s, carriages would pull up outside the ground, depositing families there for one of the biggest events of the \u201cseason,\u201d spectators who had watched those matches recalled. The crowds are smaller now, drawing in less money for the MCC, and around 2,000 to 3,000 people were expected to attend this year. \u201cIt used to be a big social event \u2026 people in top hat and tails. It was quite part of the season as they used to say in those days,\u201d Wells added. \u201cEveryone dresses down now, we\u2019re not so formal in any form of society, though looking here, there are lots of people in jackets and ties.\u201d Despite the May sunshine, almost every man wandered around in their suits, the Eton boys wore their red striped blazers and matching hats, the Harrow boys their navy-blue blazers while women wore flowing dresses or blouses and many carried designer handbags. \u201cI don\u2019t feel a sense of exclusivity at all,\u201d one spectator told CNN, pointing to the \u00a320 ($25) ticket available for people to come and watch. \u201cThe boys work really hard to get here \u2026 You may as well get rid of history because it\u2019s traditional and backward and imperialistic and whatever,\u201d she added. \u201cWe have to learn from the past, and the successes of the past too.\u201d \u2018A turgid image of snobbery\u2019 The question of the Eton vs. Harrow match has become entangled in the wider conversations around cricket presently. The sport \u2013 long associated with the English upper classes \u2013 has been buffeted by accusations of racism, sexism and elitism in the country where it originated while it has millions of fans around the world, considered more popular than any other global sport except soccer. For actor, writer and comedian Stephen Fry, the Eton vs. Harrow match is indicative of an image that English cricket can\u2019t quite shake off, what he described as \u201ca turgid image of snobbery and elitism.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not what cricket is about,\u201d Fry, a former MCC president and longtime cricket fan, told the Times in October 2022. \u201cIt\u2019s the second most popular sport in the world and it needs people to understand what a wonderful game it is, and how it\u2019s available for everybody.\u201d In the end on Friday, Harrow coasted to victory by 91 runs, posting 321-5 before Eton could only respond with 230 all out. And there may not be too many more opportunities for Eton to retaliate. \u201cTimes change. And the world is so far removed from that world now,\u201d Mark Nicholas, the current MCC president, told the Telegraph in October. \u201cCommon sense will prevail over the next four years within this compromise\u2026 I can see it moving on from here now very naturally.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/sport/eton-harrow-lords-cricket-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2022_07_25_sport_black-representation-swimming-equality-spt-intl", "text": "Omie Dale has fond memories of splashing in the sea as a child, of racing through water parks and swimming in backwaters and rivers.   \u201cThere\u2019s so much joy that can be had once you learn to swim, once you\u2019ve abandoned those fears and you can get in the water,\u201d the 25-year-old Dale, who is based in southeast London, tells CNN Sport.  Even though swimming is a joyful experience for Dale, the stark reality is that many Black communities in Britain and the US do not have safe access to swimming lessons and public pools due to historic racism and segregation \u2013 a problem that is especially alarming given that, as Dale says, it is \u201cthe only sport that can save your life.\u201d  A history of exclusion The lack of access afforded to Black communities in Britain is what motivated Dale to become a swimming teacher in September 2019.  \u201cI used to work in Kensington (in London) as a lifeguard and some of the richest people live in that borough, but also some of the poorest,\u201d she says. She saw there was a difference when private schools and independent schools would come in and all the kids were able to swim, yet hardly any children of the same age that Dale saw from state schools could swim 25 meters.  \u201cThere\u2019s a real class barrier in the sport of swimming,\u201d Dale adds.   She is a director of Swimunity, a collective offering free swimming lessons to women and children in North Kensington, West London. It was born in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster in 2017, when a residential block caught on fire, killing 72 people \u2013 and leaving many more without homes.   \u201cThere\u2019s like a lot of people who come to swim lessons \u2026 who have undergone some form of trauma, whether that be water-related trauma or trauma related to their everyday lives,\u201d Dale says.   \u201cMany people say it\u2019s like an escape from their daily lives or is, actually, the first time that they\u2019ve taken time for themselves.\u201d  While 77% of children from the most affluent families in England can swim 25 meters unaided, only 34% from the least affluent families can, according to a 2021 survey from Sport England, a non-departmental public body that fosters grassroots sports in England.  About 95% of Black adults and 80% of Black children in England do not regularly participate in swimming, according to Sport England\u2019s report, published in January 2020. Likewise, about 93% of Asian adults and 78% of Asian children, including those with Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi heritage, do not regularly participate in swimming, the same research found. This trend extends to the US, where nearly 64% of Black children have \u201clow\u201d or no ability to swim, compared with 40% of their White peers, according to 2017 data from the country\u2019s national governing body for the sport at a competitive level, USA Swimming.   The underrepresentation of Black people in the pool in the US can be traced back to the early 20th century.   Public swimming pools became popular in North America in the 1920s and 30s and were initially open to all. However, Northern politicians stipulated a \u201cWhites Only\u201d rule, referencing racist fears about Black men fraternizing with White women.   Even after legal racial segregation ended in the US in 1964, public pools continued to be hostile environments. As people of color began to use public pools, White swimmers retreated to the privacy of their own pools and private clubs, where expensive fees continue to be an economic barrier for Black families who cannot afford the cost.    Similar examples in Britain illustrate how racial and class inequalities lead to the systemic exclusion of Black people in pools. For example, more than 4.2 million people in the UK live in ethnically diverse communities where Covid-19 national lockdowns resulted in the closure or mothballing of pools, according to Swim England \u2013 England\u2019s national swimming governing body \u2013 and the Black Swimming Association (BSA), a UK-based charity that aims to encourage more African, Caribbean and Asian communities to take up swimming.  \u2018We cannot keep recovering bodies\u2019  Globally, drowning is the third leading cause of accidental injury-related death and at least 236,000 people die each year from drowning, according to 2019 data from the World Health Organization (WHO). Children are particularly affected, with drowning being one of the top five causes of death for those aged 1-14 years in 48 of 85 countries studied by the WHO.   And while natural disasters and irregular migration are notorious risk factors, so are lower socioeconomic status, lack of higher education and being a member of an ethnic minority, depending on the country, WHO research shows.  \u201cMost drowning incidents happen when people never intend to get into the water in the first place,\u201d says Dale, who was awarded Swim Teacher of the Year by Swim England in 2021.  In December 2019, three members of the same Black British family \u2013 a 53-year-old father and his two children \u2013 died in a swimming pool at a resort in Costa del Sol, Spain, Reuters reported. The father and his 16-year-old son had reportedly leapt into the water to try to save his nine-year-old daughter, who was drowning.   Danielle Obe is the co-founder and chair of the BSA. She told CNN Sport that the Costa del Sol deaths prompted her to establish the BSA in March 2020, alongside Olympic swimmer Alice Dearing, journalist Seren Jones and songwriter, rapper and producer Ed Accura.    \u201cThis was devastating because these families were actually acquainted to me and they were from my local community,\u201d Obe says. \u201c(At) that point, I called Alice and Seren, and I said, \u2018We\u2019ve been talking about doing something for our community. We\u2019ve got to do something. We\u2019ve got to do it now. We cannot keep recovering bodies.\u2019\u201d   \u201cIt\u2019s no longer just about that lack of representation,\u201d Obe adds.   \u201cIt\u2019s now about saving lives, vital water safety, education for all. Swimming is an intervention. Swimming is a life skill.\u201d  However, there is still a lack of data when it comes to drowning-related deaths by ethnicity in the UK, says Obe.  \u201cAt the moment, we don\u2019t know how much of a disparity there is between drowning and fatalities, aquatic fatalities for different communities in the UK because, up until now, drowning data isn\u2019t really captured by ethnicity, which is another point, another issue that the BSA is looking to tackle.\u201d \u2018People just don\u2019t think Black people should swim\u2019  Dearing, the first Black female swimmer to represent Britain at the Olympics when she competed at Tokyo 2020, \u201cimplores\u201d people to learn to swim.   \u201cI have been quite torn between the amazing achievement of being the first Black woman to represent GB in swimming but wanting to be my own person, my own athlete, who\u2019s known for being an athlete and not for her race and her sport combined together,\u201d she tells CNN Sport. \u201cI take the two of them just as they are \u2013 kind of like separate things. I\u2019m trying to be the best athlete and best role model that I can be to show people that they can do the sport, that the sport is for everybody.\u201d At the age of 24, Dearing was making history in Japan and became a beacon of hope for young people \u2013 especially Black girls \u2013 who wanted to break into the sport.   But her personal triumph also drew attention to the institutional access gap for people of color in swimming.    \u201cFortunately, for myself, I haven\u2019t come across any barriers at the level I\u2019m at currently,\u201d Dearing says.   \u201cBut I have faced barriers when I was younger and issues where people just don\u2019t think Black people should swim, or do swim, or think that we\u2019re better suited to other sports and so shouldn\u2019t even learn to swim or attempt swimming in the first place.\u201d  CNN reached out to the International Swimming Federation (FINA), Sport England and USA Swimming requesting a breakdown of Black and ethnic minority participation in swimming at grassroots and professional levels of the sport. However, they told CNN they were unable to provide such data.  FINA \u2013 the global governing body for swimming \u2013 told CNN it does not have a breakdown of the ethnicities of swimmers at a grassroots or elite level.   FINA said in 2021 it allocated $6.6 million towards development programs for distribution among all national federations and continental associations, while also pushing for diversity in the sport through its \u201cSwimming for All, Swimming for Life\u201d program.   \u201cFINA remains fully committed to non-discrimination,\u201d the organization said to CNN in a statement. \u201cFINA continues to work hard to ensure that the global aquatics community is a place where all athletes, coaches and administrators are treated equally. \u201cWork will continue to develop and grow with the support of members of the aquatics community as we strive to be at the forefront of this essential area,\u201d FINA added.    Sport England told CNN in a statement that it is \u201ccommitted to increasing investment in facilities and organisations across England to try to level up access to good quality sports and activities.\u201d \u201cBarriers to getting active persist and have even been exacerbated for some disadvantaged groups \u2013 like women, people with long-term health conditions, disabled people, people from ethnically diverse communities and lower socio-economic groups,\u201d the statement added.   Sport England said in May it announced further funding that brings its total investment in its 121 partners to more than \u00a3550 million ($670 million), which they\u2019ve selected \u201cdue to their unique position to tackle entrenched activity inequalities and influence positive change throughout the sector, their own networks and beyond.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s not all about the economic side of things. It is also about getting people to feel comfortable with putting their kids in swim lessons and in competitive swimming so that they can then go and do other aquatic-based sports,\u201d Joel Shinofield, the managing director of sport development at USA Swimming, told CNN during a phone call.  USA Swimming is a membership-serviced organization that has over 3,100 clubs and more than 400,000 members, according to the official website.   \u201cOur goal is to facilitate opportunities and make sure they\u2019re good ones. While our clubs are the ones that do that on the local level, the resources, guidance, support, financial investment that we provide can shift who those opportunities can be provided to and more broadly create access,\u201d he added.   Shinofield said that USA Swimming has established a 10-year initiative that will grant $1 million to develop learn-to-swim and competitive opportunities for communities served by Historical Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The program was announced in 2021, according to the USA Swimming official website.   Serving underrepresented communities  From representing their organization at the UK\u2019s first Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Summit For Sport in Birmingham, England earlier this year to facilitating swimming classes in Hackney \u2013 one of the most deprived boroughs in London \u2013 Obe hopes that the BSA will help bridge the barrier through community-level engagement.   \u201cThat community engagement really is to build trust, accountability and collaboration with disenfranchised communities and the sector,\u201d says Obe.  \u201cOnly in understanding these attitudes and understanding some of the barriers that preclude our communities from engaging in aquatics can we begin to drive change.\u201d  In August 2021, the BSA announced it would conduct a research program with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the University of Portsmouth, exploring the behaviors and barriers that prevent African, Caribbean and Asian communities from swimming.    Speaking about the program, Obe says: \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to inspire confidence with African, Caribbean and Asian communities, and the only way we\u2019re able to do that is to ensure that we understand where these communities are in the first place and understand why they don\u2019t engage in aquatics, why we don\u2019t see the representation pool side and why we don\u2019t even see the representation within some aquatic organizations.\u201d  Dale also volunteers with Mental Health Swims, a grassroots organization that facilitates swimming meet-ups for people struggling with their mental health. As part of her work for the organization, she coordinates swim events in south London to help swimmers access the mental health benefits of the sport.

The atmosphere inside Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis belied the less important nature of a preseason game, the crowd whooping loudly as Clark made her first home bucket on a driving layup in the first half. Clark finished with 12 points, eight rebounds and six assists but had a difficult shooting night, going 4-of-12 from the field and 2-of-9 from deep. \u201cI don\u2019t think I was that effective, honestly,\u201d Clark told reporters after the game. \u201cI thought more than anything I did a really good job of passing the ball, finding my teammates. \u201cI think I got into the paint, obviously, I would have liked to make a couple more threes, but sometimes, that\u2019s how you shoot it. \u201cWe really responded after we kind of had a slow start. Obviously, we don\u2019t want to have slow starts, but it\u2019s good to see us be able to respond and take the lead back and grind it out until the end.\u201d NaLyssa Smith led the way for the Fever, scoring 21 points and grabbing six rebounds, as Indiana came back from a 15-point, second-quarter deficit to take the lead with 4:57 left in the third and never looked back.

The Clark effect was in full swing with Thursday\u2019s official attendance announced at 13,028, a new preseason franchise record and around three times more than the Fever\u2019s roughly 4,000 average home attendance last season. Clark said it was \u201ca lot of fun\u201d playing in a packed, boisterous arena and highlighted how important the Fever\u2019s home fans are going to be this season. \u201cI thought they were loud, I thought they were into it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was fun to see some people in some Iowa stuff and then a lot of people in Fever gear. This is a preseason game on a Thursday night and there\u2019s 13,000 people here. \u201cI think that just shows what it\u2019s going to be like for us all season and it\u2019s going to help us. There are games at home that you\u2019re going to need to win, so I\u2019m excited for our home opener. I think it\u2019s going to be a packed out, obviously, against a really great team [the New York Liberty]. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty incredible \u2013 13,000 at a preseason game is pretty unheard of.\u201d The Fever begin their WNBA season at Mohegan Sun Arena against the Connecticut Sun on Tuesday night before the team\u2019s home opener against the Liberty on May 16.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/sport/caitlin-clark-home-debut-indiana-fever-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "sports"}}

For the first time in 85 years, the Preakness Stakes was being run on a muddy track, conditions which clearly suited the three-year-old colt.

{"id": "2024_05_10_sport_bayer-leverkusen-unbeaten-record-europa-league-spt-intl", "text": "Bayer Leverkusen\u2019s remarkable season took another extraordinary turn on Thursday as a late 2-2 draw against AS Roma stretched the club\u2019s unbeaten run to 49 games. The 4-2 aggregate victory saw Leverkusen reach a first European final in 22 years, while Josip\u00a0Stani\u0161i\u0107\u2019s 97th-minute strike ensured that the recently-crowned German champion remains undefeated this season. It means that Leverkusen has now surpassed Portuguese team Benfica\u2019s record from 1963-65 for the longest unbeaten run across all top-level matches since the introduction of European competitions,\u00a0according to UEFA. Leverkusen had come into the second-leg match at the BayArena with a two-goal lead, though that advantage was cancelled out when Leandro Paredes converted two penalties for Roma either side of halftime. The home side dominated possession throughout but struggled to capitalize on several good chances, and it wasn\u2019t until the 82nd minute that Gianluca Mancini\u2019s unfortunate own goal offered hope of a comeback. Then in the dying moments, with the likelihood of a draw quickly fading, Stani\u0161i\u0107\u00a0made a brilliant run into the box and slotted the ball into the net with the final act of the game, sparking bedlam inside the sellout stadium. Late goals have become something of a habit for Leverkusen, and this was the 17th time this season that the Bundesliga team has scored in the 90th minute or later. \u201cTo show that personality, that reaction after the second goal, to keep going and after to come back \u2013 it means a lot for us,\u201d manager Xabi Alonso said after the game. \u201cIt says a lot about the team, the conviction that\u00a0we have and it\u2019s great to finally reach the final. Last year we were really close but this year we\u2019re happy (to be) in the final and now against another Italian team.\u201d Leverkusen will face Atalanta in the Europa League final on May 22 in Dublin, Ireland, and has four games remaining to complete the season without defeat. Having already ended a 31-year trophy drought by winning a first German league title, Leverkusen can still win two more pieces of silverware this season \u2013 the Europa League and the German Cup \u2013 against Atlanta and second-tier side FC Kaiserslautern. Completing an invincible treble while remaining undefeated would certainly go down as one of greatest achievements by a European soccer club, and Leverkusen could become the first team in Bundesliga history to go a whole season without a loss if it wins its final two league matches against VfL Bochum and Augsburg. According to UEFA, Scottish side Celtic\u2019s unbeaten run of 62 games between 1915 and 1917 is the outright record for a European club, although that only included domestic league matches. \u201cIt\u2019s pure goosebumps,\u201d said Leverkusen midfielder Granit Xhaka after Thursday\u2019s game. \u201cYou dream of an atmosphere like this. You dream of games like this. As a kid, you want to be in these games and then when you equalize just before the end and get to the final, it\u2019s incredible.

{"id": "2023_02_05_sport_head-injury-suicide-female-athletes-intl-spt-cmd", "text": "Kelly Catlin and Ellie Soutter never met, but they had a lot in common.  Both were commanding athletes: Catlin, a US track cyclist, was a three-times world champion and Olympic silver medalist, and Soutter, a snowboarder, was tipped to be one of Team Great Britain\u2019s strongest contenders for the 2022 Winter Olympics, having already won a bronze medal at the 2017 European Youth Olympic Festival.  Both were incredibly smart \u2013 Catlin was studying for a master\u2019s degree in computational and mathematical engineering at Stanford University, while Soutter learned to speak French in about six months, according to her father.   At times they almost seemed superhuman. In 2013, after only three weeks of formal training and having broken her wrist, Soutter became British Champion with her arm in a cast. Meanwhile, Catlin, who had a tenderness for children, once rode 80 miles through sleet and snow to speak to a grade school about her Olympic experience.    Yet these two women\u2019s lives were tragically cut short after they sustained serious head injuries in their pursuit of sporting greatness and then took their own lives. Catlin was 23, while Soutter died by suicide on her 18th birthday.  Females may be more susceptible to concussion, and they also have worse and prolonged symptoms after their injury than men, according to a review of 25 studies of sport-related concussion published in the Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine.  However, women remain significantly underrepresented within sport and exercise science research. This, leading experts warn, means they often do not get the treatment or aftercare they need following a head injury.  Women\u2019s sports have historically not received the same attention or funding as men\u2019s sports, Dr. Ann McKee, Director of the Boston University Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s been shown that women athletes are more likely to get a concussion, they tend to have longer recovery periods,\u201d McKee added. \u201cWe do not have enough information about what happens in the female brain. We don\u2019t know if women are biologically more susceptible to these injuries,\u201d she said, adding that some research suggests the size and musculature of women\u2019s necks could play a part. Kelly  Before becoming a track cyclist, Catlin, a triplet, was a national champion road cyclist and time trial national champion, her father Mark, told CNN. After winning a Canadian international race at 17 she was invited to an Olympic training camp for a try out, where, impressed by her performance numbers, coaches immediately offered her a position on the track pursuit team.  Catlin\u2019s father, Mark, told CNN, that his daughter was \u201cintense\u201d and \u201cambitious,\u201d attributes she channeled into her sporting life. Her life changed irrevocably in January 2019. Practicing fast downhill descents in the hills near Los Angeles, she crashed and went skidding down the road.  Despite suffering road rash, Catlin got back on her bike, and finished the ride. It wasn\u2019t her first crash \u2013 she had experienced 4 or 5 hard crashes before this, her father said, and after the latest, she didn\u2019t have any symptoms at the time.  But soon after, at a World Cup track event in Berlin, Catlin was gripped by a sudden and severe headache.   \u201cShe couldn\u2019t compete,\u201d her father said. \u201cKelly is kind of this stoical individual. And if she\u2019s rolling around on the ground, clutching her head, it has to be a severe thing.\u201d On closer inspection, Catlin\u2019s helmet from LA had dents in it. Her father told CNN that this, coupled with her symptoms, caused her family to become aware she had suffered a concussion, which was later confirmed with a diagnosis from Stanford\u2019s Health Centre.  A concussion is a brain injury which happens after a hit to the head or body causes the brain to move back and forth inside the skull, according to the CDC. When Catlin returned to the US, her father says she was examined by the track training center in Colorado. It was confirmed she suffered a concussion, and a return to training protocol was advised, but not implemented or communicated to her coach, he said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any follow-up from Colorado after this. I believe they assumed she would seek care at Stanford,\u201d he told CNN.  CNN has reached out to Stanford and USA Cycling for comment.  Catlin\u2019s symptoms didn\u2019t improve, and in weekly phone calls with her parents, she admitted she was struggling with schoolwork and was unable to concentrate. Stanford Health Center, having diagnosed Catlin with concussion with ongoing symptoms, recommended that she decrease her training for 2 weeks and then gradually build back up and start sessions with an athletic trainer, medical documents sent to CNN by her father show. She was referred to a concussion specialist, the document adds. She tried to train, but \u201cshe would have to stop because she got a severe headache just from walking,\u201d according to her father. Her heart rate would also accelerate rapidly from even the smallest exertion, leaving her with \u201cno exercise tolerance whatsoever,\u201d he added.  Her injury had other consequences. \u201cAs far as we knew she was never a person that suffered from depression. She had an interesting sense of humor.  She was always upbeat and bubbly about things,\u201d her father told CNN.  \u201cShe basically thought her life was over. She was no longer able to be the athlete that she was, she was failing her teammates. And she wasn\u2019t able to succeed in school now. And I think ultimately, that\u2019s why she took her life, because she thought her life was over,\u201d he added.  At the end of January, Catlin made a serious but non-fatal suicide attempt, and was involuntarily admitted to the locked psychiatric ward at Stanford, her father told CNN. A month after that attempt, she took her own life.     Ellie   Soutter\u2019s father Tony said there were many dimensions to his young daughter \u2013 not only was she an \u201cadrenaline junkie,\u201d but she was \u201cvery conscientious\u201d and excelled in school, even after moving from England to France.   Aged 12, Soutter took up snowboarding at school \u2013 and just months later, she was spotted in her hometown resort of Les Gets and trialed by Team Great Britain in February 2013.  \u201cIt was quite obvious why she kept winning competitions because she just made it easy,\u201d her father said. \u201cShe just made it look graceful and beautiful.\u201d But training took its toll \u2013 Soutter told CNN that his daughter suffered seven major concussions in five years, between 2013 and 2018.  \u201cI was being advised by doctors \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, she\u2019s young enough she\u2019ll bounce back. As she progressed, becoming an elite athlete starting on the World Cup circuit, every time she had another concussion, they got worse, and they took longer to recover from,\u201d he told CNN.     \u201cWith every concussion, with the exception of a few minor knocks, Ellie saw a doctor in person,\u201d he added. \u201cI was always told that she was young enough to bounce back to full health after each case and therefore never consulted with the doctors that I met, about any previous concussions.\u201d But Soutter\u2019s final concussion was so \u201chuge\u201d that she spent two nights in the hospital. \u201cWhen I got there, she didn\u2019t even know who I was or where she was,\u201d her father said. Soutter was then selected for the Junior Snowboard World Championships in New Zealand August 2018.  But a month before the competition, she died by suicide.  Her father said a neurologist conducted a CT scan of her brain and reaction tests three months after her final concussion, but said she was \u201cabsolutely fine\u201d and could continue competing.                                                                                                                                 Like Catlin, Soutter had issues with studying and concentrating, becoming more insular as she suffered from crippling headaches. She also started suffering from insomnia.  \u201cShe would literally sit with the tutor a good month after a concussion, and suddenly, she\u2019d go blind. She\u2019d not be able to see \u2013 everything would go black and dark,\u201d her father said. After missing a flight to snowboard training, Soutter died by suicide on her 18th birthday. Team GB referred CNN to GB Snowsport when approached for comment, adding that Ellie only competed for Team GB at one event.  In order to represent Britain in international competitions, GB Snowsport says athletes or their coaches are required to demonstrate that the athlete has reached established performance criteria, is of the relevant technical ability to compete, and has appropriate medical clearance to compete. A large number of athletes can represent Britain at different levels of international competition but are not part of a programme delivered and overseen by GB Snowsport.  \u201cAs Ellie was not part of the GB Snowsport programme, we were unable to implement a personalised recovery and management programme for Ellie,\u201d a spokesperson for GB Snowsport told CNN in an email. \u201cShe was, however, covered by national policies and protocols around fitness to compete, and would not have been cleared for any activity \u2013 training or competition \u2013 overseen by GB Snowsport without being able to demonstrate appropriate medical sign-off,\u201d they added. The spokesperson for GB Snowsport told CNN: \u201cWe take concussions and head injuries incredibly seriously, and in reviewing contemporaneous records from the time that Ellie was involved in snowsport we are confident that GB Snowsport staff applied and followed every appropriate process.\u201d Catlin and Soutter aren\u2019t the only young sporting women whose lives have been cut short in this way. After 29-year-old Australian rules football player Jacinda Barclay took her life in 2020, post-mortem research by scientists found that she had degradation to her cerebral white matter unusual for someone her age.  \u201cFor someone her age, you would expect to see lovely pristine white matter, and hers looked like she was an old woman in that it was basically degraded,\u201d Michael Buckland, founder and Executive Director of the Australian Sports Brain Bank, who studied Barclay\u2019s brain, told CNN.  \u201cWe haven\u2019t gone back and done specific white matter studies on our donors,\u201d he told CNN, adding that the bank hasn\u2019t done peer reviewed research on this.  \u201cBut what struck me, just as someone that sees a lot of brains \u2013 this is not normal for someone of that age.\u201d  Damage to white matter has been associated with dementia, according to research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.   Opportunities missed Suicide after concussion is rare. However patients diagnosed with concussion or mild traumatic brain injury had double the risk of suicide and a higher risk of suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts than people without brain injuries, a 2018 study from researchers at the University of Harvard published in JAMA Neurology found. Dr. Robert Cantu, clinical professor of neurology at the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at Boston University School of Medicine told CNN that there are several theories as to why incidence of suicide is higher in people who have suffered concussion. One theory, he explained, is that those suffering from persistent post-concussion symptoms may have structural or functional brain damage and could be experiencing \u201cbehavioral dysregulation: short fuse, irritability, [and] can\u2019t suppress impulses the way you normally could.\u201d   With these emotional problems, \u201cthey would be more prone to perhaps do something impulsive, like commit suicide,\u201d Cantu, medical director of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, told CNN. A second theory, Cantu noted, is that post-concussive symptoms prevent people from getting back into their sport and stop them \u201cfrom being the person that they were before their injury.\u201d Neither theory is proven to the exclusion of the other, Cantu said, adding he thinks increased suicidality was \u201ca combined factor involving both in many, if not most cases.\u201d There are also differences in the way brain injuries affect women.  A study of female soccer players across US high schools found they are nearly twice as likely to suffer concussion as their male counterparts, according to research that looked at over 80,000 adolescent athletes, published in the journal JAMA Network Open.  Women remain significantly underrepresented within sport and exercise science research: a 2021 study examining papers from some of the most influential sports medical journals found that only 6% of the studies were solely focused on women, compared with 31% of studies that included just men. Other researchers have pointed to female sex hormones, with risk of concussion changing with hormone levels during a menstrual cycle.  McKee said all athletes can also experience \u201cnon-concussive\u201d injuries: \u201chits to the head that can be of the same magnitude as concussion, but they don\u2019t rise to the level of symptoms for whatever reason, so a player tends to play right through it.\u201d Cumulative exposure to repetitive head impacts \u2013 including concussion and non- concussive injuries \u2013 increases the risk for the neurodegenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known as CTE, McKee said.  The disease, which can only be formally diagnosed with an autopsy, has mostly been seen in either veterans or people who played contact sports, particularly American football, say researchers. The disease occurs when the brain starts to degenerate likely due to repeated head traumas, according to the Mayo Clinic, which notes CTE is \u201cassociated with recurrent concussions.\u201d But scientists aren\u2019t only concerned about concussions.  Previous studies have shown subconcussive head impacts \u2013 repetitive hits to the head and body that do not cause symptoms \u2013 can still result in long-term neurological disease.   According to The Concussion Legacy Foundation, \u201cthe best available evidence suggests that subconcussive impacts, not concussions, are the driving force behind CTE.\u201d There have been cases of CTE discovered in athletes who have never been diagnosed with a concussion, according to the Concussion Legacy Foundation. And other changes in the brain after repetitive head impacts aside from CTE are likely \u201cequally important,\u201d McKee said. \u201cWe also see damage to the white matter. And that appears to be mostly in the frontal lobe, but also in the temporal lobes,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to understand the relationship of those white matter changes to behavioral and mood symptoms, perhaps even suicidality,\u201d she said.  McKee stressed that concussion management is important, but physicians and athletes should also be aware of other injuries. \u201cThe problem is the subclinical hits \u2013 the non-concussive injuries that aren\u2019t detected, you don\u2019t pull the player off the field \u2013 and they can be in the hundreds or even the 1000s in a single season,\u201d she explained. Lack of research  Though a growing body of data suggests women in sport are more likely to sustain a concussion, have more severe symptoms, and to take longer to recover, most sports-related concussions protocols are based on data from men.  In a review in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers looked at 171 concussion studies written since 1967 which are used to inform the most influential consensus and position statements in treating sports-related concussions. Clinicians rely on these documents to guide their medical practice when treating athletes \u2013 but most of the studies are focused on men. Only 1% of them was looking exclusively at concussions in women and 40% of them didn\u2019t have any women in a sample of participants at all.   There is another risk factor for women in sport when they sustain head injuries, Katherine Snedaker, founder and executive director of PINK Concussions, a non-profit dedicated to women\u2019s health and brain injury, told CNN.  There is a gulf of millions of dollars separating women and men when it comes to average annual salaries in most professional sports. Outside of elite sport, Snedaker says, female athletes often don\u2019t have access to the same medical care as men, meaning head injuries aren\u2019t spotted as routinely.   \u201cThey tend to push really hard through the injury,\u201d she said. And many women can\u2019t afford to take time out to recover: even professional athletes will supplement their sports income with other jobs, she added, and many are caregivers. \u201cWhen they really crater, it\u2019s a couple of days or weeks later.\u201d  Snedaker said female athletes often weren\u2019t aware they had suffered a head injury. If they were, she said, there were no appropriate medical or sporting staff to inform. Not enough support The families of Catlin and Soutter feel the young women didn\u2019t get enough support after their injuries. After Catlin\u2019s first suicide attempt, she was released from an involuntary admission to the psychiatric ward after threatening legal action, and a conference between psychiatrists, her coach and her parents.  She attended therapy sessions, which she agreed to attend during the conference, but found \u201cthey were geared toward suicidal freshman with a whole set of different issues than an elite Olympic athlete,\u201d her father told CNN. She got a referral to a sports psychologist that worked with the Stanford athletic department, but the department forbade the psychologist from seeing Catlin because she was not a varsity athlete, her father added.  She contacted the office of a sports psychologist with whom she had developed a rapport while in the hospital \u2013 but, his appointment secretary said he had no openings for six months, her father told CNN.  \u201cWherever she turned she could not find help,\u201d he said, adding that his daughter tried a suicide hotline several times: she was once put on hold and once received no answer. Catlin described his daughter as a \u201cstoic, female warrior type person that isn\u2019t going to admit that she\u2019s struggling.\u201d  \u201cShe needed a sports psychiatrist that really could understand what she was going through and understand the rigors of her life in terms of preparation for competitions and the athletic side of it and what it could potentially do to you.\u201d Her father said a major factor in his daughter\u2019s death was \u201ca lack of communication between the facilities that were involved in Kelly\u2019s care. No one was in charge and they assumed the other institutions were following up when they weren\u2019t,\u201d he added. In a statement sent to CNN, Luisa Rapport, director of emergency communications and media relations at Stanford University did not address any of the specific allegations made by Catlin\u2019s family.  She said while the university does not discuss in the media the details of individual students\u2019 experiences, \u201csupporting the mental and emotional health of students is a critical priority for Stanford.\u201d  \u201cStudents in need of mental health crisis assistance \u2013 including students having suicidal thoughts \u2013 and those who are concerned about students in need of assistance, can contact the University\u2019s Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) 24 hours-a-day, seven days-a-week,\u201d she added. Rapport said that in addition to this, \u201cthere are multiple places where psychological services may be provided for students depending on individualized need and treatment recommendations, including, for example, affiliated hospital services and clinics through Stanford\u2019s Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, and mental health programs and clinicians in the community.\u201d In a statement sent to CNN, USA Cycling said it was \u201cdevastated\u201d by Catlin\u2019s death, adding: \u201cShe brought focus and determination to everything she did, and served as an inspiration to everyone who knew her.  \u201cAs the National Governing Body for the sport of cycling, USA Cycling prioritizes the holistic wellbeing of the riders on the U.S. National Team and has a longstanding commitment to providing both physical and mental health resources to members of the team,\u201d a representative for USA Cycling added.   After his daughter Ellie\u2019s death, Soutter was contacted by the UNITE Brain Bank, who wanted to study her brain as part of their research into CTE. But even in that facility \u2013 the biggest of its kind in the world \u2013 of some 1,300 brains, only 3% belonged to women, Ann McKee, Director of the Boston University Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center told CNN. \u201cWhen I actually started looking into CTE \u2013 all of the work that they\u2019ve done with the footballers in America, she had every single symptom and more,\u201d Soutter told CNN. \u201cIt was quite obvious to me that there was a definite link in her starting to get into dark places and feeling bad and anxious and not sleeping properly. All of those symptoms \u2026 Every one that\u2019s involved in CTE was part of Ellie\u2019s life,\u201d he added. \u201cI truly believe today that my daughter would be alive had I had any inkling, you know, even the smallest bit of information.\u201d Editor\u2019s Note: If you are in the US and you or a loved one have contemplated suicide, call The National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255) to connect with a trained counselor.

{"id": "2024_05_14_sport_caitlin-clarks-first-wnba-game", "text": "No. 1 overall WNBA draft pick Caitlin Clark\u00a0had mixed success in\u00a0her regular season debut Tuesday night,\u00a0scoring 20 points but committing 10 turnovers as her\u00a0Indiana Fever\u00a0lost\u00a0to the Connecticut Sun 92-71. The all-time leading scorer in NCAA Division I history tied for the most points scored in the game with Connecticut\u2019s DeWanna Bonner. \u201cTonight the rookie joins Maya Moore and Edna Campbell as the only players in WNBA history to tally 20+ pts and 4+ 3PM in their debut,\u201d the WNBA said about Clark in a post on X. Clark went up against Alyssa Thomas, the 2023 league MVP runner-up and Connecticut Sun forward. The Sun\u2019s four-time All-Star notched a triple-double Tuesday with 13 points, 13 assists, and 10 rebounds. The Suns had five players in double figures, with Bonner leading the way. Bonner tallied 20 points and had six rebounds. After finding herself in foul trouble early, Clark spent much of the first quarter on the bench. Midway through the second quarter, Clark made a steal and took the ball down court for a transition lay-up to score her first career WNBA points.\u00a0Her first three-point bucket came in the final minute before halftime. Clark picked up her pace in the second half, but the Fever were overwhelmed by the Sun team, a semifinalist in last season\u2019s WNBA playoffs. Clark struggled with ball security against the Sun\u2019s intense defensive pressure. Clark also added three assists and two steals against the Sun. Clark says she\u2019s \u2018disappointed\u2019 After the loss, Clark said she would\u2019ve liked to have played better during her debut game, but that she\u2019s eager to do so during future games this season. \u201cObviously I\u2019m disappointed. Nobody likes to lose, that\u2019s how it is,\u201d Clark said in her post-game interview. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think you can beat yourself up too much about one game. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to help this team. No matter who it is on this team, no one can do that with how they played,\u201d she said. \u201cJust learn from it and move on.\u201d It took her a little while to settle into the game, Clark said. \u201cI thought the second half was a lot better, minus some of the turnovers. But just getting more comfortable, and that\u2019s going to come with experience and getting to play with these girls,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the more games I play, the more comfortable I\u2019m going to get.\u201d The Fever will be in action again on Thursday in the team\u2019s home opener against the New York Liberty at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis. Clark\u2019s WNBA debut was much-anticipated The WNBA season started with the league\u2019s newest star taking center stage. In the WNBA general managers\u2019 predictions for the season, Clark was voted most likely to win Rookie of the Year. The rookie sensation, who had a historic NCAA season with the Iowa Hawkeyes, is at the forefront of a new wave of interest in women\u2019s basketball and her arrival in the WNBA is a moment fans have been anticipating for some time now. More than 13,000 fans were in attendance as\u00a0Clark\u00a0made her home preseason debut last week in an 83-80 victory for the Indiana Fever over the Atlanta Dream. Hype for Clark\u2019s debut season has been at a fever pitch - for home and away fans. On Monday, the Sun announced their opener against the Fever was sold out with 8,910 tickets at Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Connecticut, snatched up. The Sun last sold out the Mohegan Sun Arena in 2003 - more than 20 years ago. At Mohegan Sun Arena, Clark\u2019s fans made their presence known with a big ovation during player introductions and loud cheers the first time Clark touched the ball.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/sport/caitlin-clarks-first-wnba-game/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "sports"}}

The scores remained level for almost the entire first half before Ella Toone gave United the lead with a dazzling goal on the stroke of half-time, and Spurs collapsed in the second half to derail any hope of a comeback. \u201cWe are history makers for Manchester United,\u201d the club\u2019s manager Marc Skinner told the BBC. \u201cI didn\u2019t need to remind the owners of that, they know. There is a lot of support and love for our team and the growth. \u201cWe want to compete for titles but you all know how important adding that first piece of silverware is.

It seemed that the half would end goalless, that is until Toone created a little magic in its final moments. She evaded Eveliina Summanen\u2019s challenge, wrongfooting and swerving past her, before unleashing a powerful strike from outside the box that curled into the top right-hand corner of the net, past Becky Spencer\u2019s outstretched fingertips. United doubled its lead shortly after halftime, when Rachel Williams rose highest for Katie Zelem\u2019s perfectly weighted free-kick and headed the ball into the net, as she had been threatening to do all game. And the club\u2019s victory was all but confirmed two minutes later as a Tottenham defensive lapse gifted United a third goal when Spencer, attempting to clear the ball, simply passed it to Luc\u00eda Garc\u00eda who tapped it in for a 3-0 lead. Garc\u00eda still had time for a second goal, rifling the ball into the net after Lisa Naalsund had controlled Melvine Malard\u2019s chip into the box, and added some extra gloss to the scoreline.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/sport/manchester-united-fa-cup-tottenham-hotspur-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_sport_hattan-alsaif-mma-saudi-arabia-spt-intl", "text": "Hattan Alsaif has grown accustomed to sparring with men. Rarely shy about confronting heavier, stronger opponents, she knows what it\u2019s like to absorb blow after blow until tears begin to shine in her eyes, her face red and hot from crying. As one of the few women at her gym in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia \u2013 and the only woman hopeful of fighting at an elite level \u2013 Alsaif had little choice but to train with and against her male counterparts when she first took up martial arts. She credits her sometimes brutal introduction to the sport as one of the reasons for her success. \u201cI was the only girl doing it day and night, day and night, day and night,\u201d Alsaif told CNN Sport. \u201cI always spar with guys, I train with guys, I\u2019m always with the guys in the gym. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy thing, so when it comes to the cage, when I get a hit from a girl, I feel like, \u2018Whoa, is this all you\u2019ve got?\u2019\u201d The 22-year-old had already made history in MMA, even before her atomweight bout against Egypt\u2019s Nada Faheem on Friday, which she won by knock out in the second round. In January, Alsaif signed a contract with the Professional Fighters League (PFL), making her the first woman from Saudi Arabia to join a global MMA promotion. It was a notable moment in a country known for its socially conservative attitudes, where sporting opportunities have historically been limited for women. The Saudi women\u2019s soccer team only played its first match two years ago, while a domestic soccer league wasn\u2019t established until 2020. Alsaif is acutely aware of her status as a trailblazer for female MMA fighters in Saudi Arabia and takes such a responsibility seriously. \u201cIt\u2019s big, to be honest, because I\u2019m going to be carrying this thing my entire life,\u201d she said, speaking to CNN before her MMA debut fight on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit heavy to carry it, but I\u2019m excited and proud to be the person to do it.\u201d Alsaif endured a difficult upbringing, orphaned at the age of 10 after both of her parents died in a short space of time. She says she battled depression during her teenage years before finding solace in martial arts, helping her to discover a sense of purpose and peace. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a normal childhood or an easy childhood because of the loss of my parents,\u201d said Alsaif. \u201cBut after God, martial arts helped me a lot \u2013 so, so, so much. It changed my life 100% for the better. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m so addicted to martial arts. I don\u2019t want to stop doing [it] because it\u2019s just the thing that makes me feel alive. I feel I\u2019m alive when I train, when I fight, in the gym \u2013 I can feel my soul alive. \u201cWhen I breathe after the rounds, when I feel sick, when I feel tired, when I feel courage, when I feel scared, those moments, every part of that, it makes me feel alive. It\u2019s something that means a lot to me.\u201d Growing up, Alsaif had always loved extreme, adrenaline-fueled sports, and her curiosity to try something new took her to a boxing gym in her local neighborhood. That piqued her interest, but she soon found that the boxing class she was attending lacked rigor and professionalism. Then, after seeing videos of Saudi MMA fighter Abdullah Al-Qahtani on social media, the pair exchanged messages and Alsaif was invited to try the sport for herself. \u201cI started looking at the guys, and they were hitting the bags with kicks and elbows and knees,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI was like, they have more weapons than I do. I only have hands [in boxing]. I felt so jealous \u2026 I love to do the things that have more power.\u201d Alsaif started to compete in Muay Thai \u2013 the stand-up, striking combat sport originating in Thailand \u2013 and went on to win titles at the World Combat Games, the Saudi Games and the International Federation of Muaythai Associations (IFMA) World Championships under the guidance of coach Feras Sadaa. Sadaa, coach of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Muay Thai national team, has been central to Alsaif\u2019s success, though his influence extends far beyond a sporting sphere. \u201cAll these years, I never felt what [having a] father means at all,\u201d said Alsaif. \u201cAnd he was a gift from God. He did everything with me. He helped me in every situation, in the gym or outside of the gym. \u201cHe was like family. He always told anyone else that Hattan is not just my student, Hattan is one of my kids \u2026 I wish to make him so happy [and] represent him in the best way I can.\u201d Friday\u2019s fight card in Riyadh, headlined by Al-Qahtani, was Alsaif\u2019s first chance to assess whether she was able to translate her Muay Thai prowess into success in an MMA cage. The event, part of the PFL\u2019s growing prominence in the region, featured fighters from across the Middle East and North Africa, less than three months since Claressa Shields and Kelsey De Santis contested the first professional female MMA bout in Saudi Arabia. Last year, SURJ Sports Investments Company, which is owned by Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF), acquired a minority stake in the PFL, part of the PFL\u2019s strategy to recruit more fighters and attract more fans in the MENA region. Alsaif never envisioned herself becoming an MMA pioneer when she took her first curious steps into a combat gym, but said that she wants to leave a legacy in the sport. Her upcoming bout is the first step towards achieving that goal and also an opportunity to reflect on all that she has overcome during her short time as an MMA fighter. She does that between rounds in the gym, wiping any tears from her eyes and reminding herself of the effort and energy she has so far devoted to her pursuit. \u201cI start looking at myself in the mirror and I\u2019d be like, \u2018You have killed yourself; you have cried; you have sacrificed everything,\u2019\u201d said Alsaif. \u201c\u2018You are really strong; you are your own role model\u2019 \u2026 It does give me a lot of motivation.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/sport/hattan-alsaif-mma-saudi-arabia-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "sports"}}

{"id": "2024_05_12_sport_naia-ncaa-transgender-ban-sports", "text": "Like any competitive swimmer, Meghan Cortez-Fields knows how high the stakes can be in a sport where mere hundredths of a second can mean the difference between victory and defeat. But she is among the few who have feared what victory may bring. \u201cI was afraid that if I was able to win, all of my success would be discredited because I was trans,\u201d Cortez-Fields, a senior on the women\u2019s swim team at New Jersey\u2019s Ramapo College, told CNN. As an NCAA competitor, Cortez-Fields underwent more than a year of hormone therapy, blood tests and testosterone tracking to meet the association\u2019s transgender athlete guidelines and achieve her dream of swimming alongside other women. In recent weeks, however, the NCAA has faced a flood of calls to further restrict the participation of trans students after a much smaller athletics association, the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), voted to effectively ban trans women from competing in most of its women\u2019s sports programs. Last month, the NCAA announced its policy is \u201cunder review.\u201d Marshi Smith, the co-founder of the Independent Council on Women\u2019s Sports (ICONS), which fights against trans women\u2019s participation in women\u2019s sports, applauded the NAIA\u2019s ban as a \u201ccrucial measure\u201d and called on the NCAA to \u201crelease a policy that protects the women\u2019s category.\u201d Critics like Smith argue that transgender women \u2013 even those who have undergone treatment to lower their testosterone levels\u00a0\u2013 have unfair physical advantages that would deprive cisgender women of opportunities to succeed. But transgender athletes and their advocates point to a lack of consistent, direct research to support this claim. They say trans women deserve the right to compete alongside their peers. \u201cThe idea that trans women are taking over women\u2019s sport is a pretty outside statement given the number of trans women who are competing in the NCAA,\u201d said Anna Baeth, director of research at Athlete Ally, an organization that advocates for LGBTQ equality in sports. Baeth estimates fewer than 40 of the NCAA\u2019s more than 500,000 athletes are known to be transgender. Last month, Athlete Ally sent the NCAA letters signed by more than 400 current and former professional and collegiate athletes, as well as hundreds of researchers and advocacy groups, imploring the organization to continue allowing transgender athletes to compete. \u201cTo deny transgender athletes the fundamental right to be who they are, to access the sport they love, and to receive the proven mental and physical health benefits of sport goes against the very principles of the NCAA\u2019s Constitution,\u201d read the letter signed by athletes including retired US women\u2019s national soccer team star Megan Rapinoe. \u201cEvery single student should have access to the lifesaving power of sports.\u201d \u2018I believed I needed to sacrifice being trans in order to swim\u2019 Competitive swimming pools have become a battleground in the fight over transgender athletes\u2019 exclusion, exploding into focus when University of Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas became the first transgender athlete to win an NCAA Division I title in 2022. Smith, the ICONS co-founder, said watching Thomas compete \u201cwas really devastating.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s unfair,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt like I was witnessing women shriveling up.\u201d The NCAA\u2019s policy was revised in 2022 to align \u201ctransgender student-athlete participation with the Olympic Movement.\u201d The association takes a sport-by-sport approach, which allows trans players to participate if they have undergone one year of testosterone suppression treatment and meet the testosterone level required by their sport\u2019s national or international governing body. Trans women athletes, including Cortez-Fields, say competing alongside other women is a crucial step toward feeling like their authentic selves and can help combat feelings of isolation. \u201cTrans people have existed since the beginning of time. But we win and it becomes an issue,\u201d she said. For Cortez-Fields, plunging into the muffled echo of the water has always felt like a sacred moment. But that embracing environment became increasingly fraught as she began to express her trans identity during her second season on the men\u2019s team. \u201cWearing a men\u2019s suit, having to tape my breasts, even just competing against men \u2013 it starts to hurt more because it feels like a part of you is dying and wilting away,\u201d she said. \u201cI believed I needed to sacrifice being trans in order to swim.\u201d Cortez-Fields spent more than a year undergoing hormone therapy, meticulously tracking her testosterone levels and trying to train even as her body no longer allowed her to glide through the water with the speed and stamina she once did. Finally, in her senior year, she was cleared by the NCAA to compete on the women\u2019s team, which Cortez-Fields said at the time was \u201cone of the most exciting things that\u2019s ever happened.\u201d She recalls her final meet in February as \u201cone of the best meets of my entire life.\u201d \u201cEvery single moment was just magical,\u201d she said. \u201cI just felt like I was literally flying to the water.\u201d During the meet, Cortez-Fields broke two school records and placed 2nd in the 100-yard butterfly \u2013 successes she says were scrutinized by anti-trans groups and conservative news outlets but widely celebrated by her teammates. \u201cThe majority of the women I have met and swim against, they have celebrated me. They make me feel like I deserve to be there, and I should fight for my place there,\u201d she said. What the research does \u2013 and doesn\u2019t \u2013 say The debate is complicated by a lack of significant research \u2013 and scientific consensus \u2013\u00a0on whether trans athletes, particularly trans women, have an athletic advantage over their cisgender peers, even after they have undergone testosterone-reducing therapies. Dr. Joshua Safer, executive director of the Mount Sinai Center for Transgender Medicine and Surgery, said many elite sports associations are trying to craft policies without meaningful data on how trans athletes perform in their specific categories, such as soccer or basketball. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to be \u2018fair\u2019 \u2013 however fair is defined \u2013 then you need to look at individual athletic activities directly,\u201d Safer said. \u201cIt would be a matter of taking transgender people who participate in sports and looking at them before and after some of their treatments and really measuring differences, especially in common sports.\u201d Such studies may be especially difficult to perform given the relatively small number of trans athletes known to be competing at elite levels. Though research is ongoing, a 2017 review in the journal Sports Medicine found \u201cno direct or consistent research\u201d showing trans people have an advantage. A more recent October 2023 review concluded that sex differences do develop following puberty, but many are \u201creduced, if not erased, over time by gender affirming hormone therapy.\u201d\u00a0 Qualities such as height and limb length appear to be \u201cless malleable,\u201d the study said, though it pointed out that there are no efforts to restrict cisgender athletes who are exceptionally gifted physically. Until more data is available, Safer believes governing bodies like the NCAA should be wary of enacting sweeping restrictions so that \u201cwe don\u2019t get ahead of ourselves.\u201d \u201cAssociations should err on the side of being cautious and inclusive until data indicates that there may be an advantage, and then they can make adjustments,\u201d he said. Looking for a lifeline in Title IX In the absence of a scientific consensus, both sides have argued their case by invoking Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in federally funded education programs. Trans advocacy organizations remain hopeful that President Joe Biden\u2019s administration will follow through on its proposal last year to revise Title IX to bar schools from enacting bans on transgender athletes. \u201cTitle IX is really the only major legislation at the federal level that protects cisgender women athletes, and we do believe that should apply to trans athletes,\u201d said Baeth with Athlete Ally. \u201cWe want Title IX to consider gender, not just sex assigned at birth.\u201d Any direct mention of trans athletes was notably missing, however, from the Biden administration\u2019s changes to Title IX last month, which expanded protections for LGBTQ students. Before the new changes were announced, a senior Biden administration official told reporters that the process of reviewing the trans sports protections is \u201congoing.\u201d But some cisgender athletes and conservative lawmakers see the inclusion of trans women in women\u2019s sports as a striking violation of Title IX\u2019s nondiscrimination rule. In March, more than a dozen current and former collegiate female athletes sued the NCAA over its transgender participation policy and accused the organization of a \u201cradical departure from Title IX\u2019s original meaning\u201d by allowing trans women to compete against cisgender women. Their outcry was echoed last month by more than a dozen Republican lawmakers who wrote in a letter to NCAA president Charlie Baker that they believe transgender women\u2019s participation will deprive cisgender women \u201cof a fair opportunity to compete and achieve athletic success.\u201d Republican lawmakers at the state and local level have largely driven the push to bar trans people from competing in sports aligning with their gender identity, and their efforts have not been confined to elite competition. Restrictions against trans players have spread across Little League baseball diamonds, high school soccer fields and into the halls of state legislatures nationwide. At least 25 states have laws or regulations in place that ban transgender students, particularly trans women and girls, from participating on the team that aligns with their gender identity, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit think tank that tracks such legislation. Cortez-Fields says that while the bans are not surprising, she fears the impact they\u2019ll have on many trans children who may already be struggling to overcome feelings of isolation. \u201cPart of gender affirming care, in a sense, is being able to compete on the team of your gender and with fellow people of your gender,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a small minority, but that minority does matter, and they deserve their fair participation as well.\u201d CNN\u2019s DJ Judd contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/sport/naia-ncaa-transgender-ban-sports/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "sports"}}

According to Forbes\u2019 list, which was released on Thursday, Ronaldo earned $260 million over the last 12 months, $200 million from his club contract with Al-Nassr and $60 million in off-field earnings. The 39-year-old headed the rankings for the fourth time ahead of golfer Jon Rahm, who joined the Saudi-backed LIV Golf Tour in a lucrative three-year deal in December, and Inter Miami forward Lionel Messi. Rahm\u2019s total earnings are $218 million, Forbes calculated \u2013 $198 million through playing wages alone \u2013 while Messi\u2019s are $135 million, more than half of which ($70 million) are off-the-field payments. Ronaldo, one of four Saudi-based soccer players on the list of the 50 highest-paid athletes, made his debut for Al-Nassr in January 2023. This season, the club is set to finish second in the Saudi Pro League behind Al-Hilal. For the first time, the top-10 highest paid athletes have each earned more than $100 million, combining for a record $1.38 billion, according to Forbes. Also included in the top 10 are the NBA\u2019s LeBron James, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and Steph Curry, as well as soccer players Neymar, Karim Benzema \u2013 both of whom represent Saudi clubs \u2013 and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9.

After months of talk and canceled fights, the two boxers will exchange blows to crown the first undisputed heavyweight champion since Lennox Lewis in 1999, and the division\u2019s first undisputed champion in the four-belt era. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about their fight. How to watch Fury and Usyk will take center stage on Saturday, May 18, at the Kingdom Arena in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The undercard will get underway at 12 p.m. ET, with the main event ringwalks expected to start at 6 p.m. ET. DAZN will broadcast the fight around the world, with viewers in the US able to watch on ESPN\u2019s pay-per-view service. Sky Sports and TNT Sports will show the fight in the UK via their pay-per-view platforms. A long time in the making A fight between Fury and Usyk has been a long time coming. In one corner is Fury, who has gone through a gauntlet of high-powered stars \u2013 including Wladimir Klitschko, Dillian Whyte and a trilogy against Deontay Wilder \u2013 to be in possession of the WBC heavyweight title. In the other corner is Usyk, who had already conquered the cruiserweight division before stepping up to heavyweight, winning \u2013 and defending \u2013 the WBO, WBA and IBF titles against Anthony Joshua and Daniel Dubois. While boxing fans have long expressed their frustrations about the best not fighting the best, reports began to circulate last March that the two camps were close to agreeing terms for a fight in April. Finally, a date of December 23 was agreed, but following a controversial, tougher-than-expected fight for Fury against former UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou, the fight was delayed until February, 2024. Yet, on the eve of the second date, it was postponed once more after the Briton suffered \u201ca freak cut\u201d above his eye during a sparring session. The Ukrainian revealed afterwards that he had missed the birth of his daughter because of his preparations for the fight. But after rescheduling twice, the fight is on. All on the line There\u2019s a lot at stake besides the four heavyweight world titles, with the winner crowned one of the greatest heavyweights of his generation. Undefeated records are also at risk. Fury has won 34 bouts and has one draw since turning professional, while Usyk has won all 21 of his fights. The 37-year-old Usyk is ranked as the third best pound-for-pound boxer in the world by The Ring magazine, and becoming the undisputed world heavyweight champion would cement his position as the standard-bearer for the division. A victory for Fury would help him recover from his surprisingly poor showing against Ngannou in October, while also possibly setting up a long-awaited, high-profile, all-British fight against former heavyweight champion Joshua. Physically, Fury has the edge over Usyk. He stands at 6-feet-9-inches with an 85-inch reach while Usyk is listed at 6-feet-3-inches with a 78-inch reach. It will likely be a tactical affair, with both fighters not giving much away as they search for a chink in the other\u2019s armour. At a news conference in Riyadh, Fury\u2019s message to Usyk was: \u201cGod bless him. I\u2019ll say a prayer for him before the fight and for us both to get out of the ring safely.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/sport/tyson-fury-oleksandr-usyk-boxing-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_04_sport_grande-torino-superga-disaster-75th-anniversary-spt-intl", "text": "Umberto Motto had always dreamed of playing for Torino FC. He had dreamed of pulling on the team\u2019s maroon shirt in front of thousands of adoring fans. And he had dreamed of hearing his name announced as he made his way onto the pitch at the Stadio Filadelfia. A local boy born in the northern Italian city of Turin and the captain of Torino\u2019s youth team, Motto seemed destined to represent his boyhood club. His dream did come true \u2013 and sooner than he expected \u2013 but the day was a living nightmare. On May 4, 1949, Motto was giving a tour of Turin to two clients of his parents\u2019 factory, which manufactured shirts for Torino and the Italian national team. Motto recalls a dense fog that hung over the city and says it hadn\u2019t stopped raining for seven days straight, leading the river Po to burst its banks in places. So bad was the weather that Motto decided to abandon sightseeing in the city and take the two visitors up to the Superga hill and Superga Basilica that overlook Turin, hoping to at least send the tourists home with a view to remember. The weather, however, was even worse and the fog meant they could barely see a few metres in front of their faces, much less the city below. On their way back down into Turin, the trio stopped for coffee and Motto remembers conversing with the caf\u00e9 owner about how unusually bad the weather had been. When they arrived back in the city, they were met by another unusual sight: the roads packed with cars all honking their horns. \u201cWe thought something good had happened,\u201d Motto, now 93 years old, recalls to CNN. Motto returned to the Torino FC headquarters in the city where he was met by the building\u2019s caretaker, Mario Lanati, who quickly ushered him upstairs. \u201cUmberto, you have to know that something disastrous has happened,\u201d Lanati told him. \u201cThe plane crashed.\u201d A confused Motto replied: \u201cWhich plane?\u201d Lanati\u2019s answer would irrevocably change Motto\u2019s life and the lives of everyone associated with Torino. The plane Lanati was talking about had been carrying almost the entire Torino first team from Lisbon, Portugal where it had been playing a friendly match against Benfica. With the approach to Turin-Aeritalia Airport affected by the weather conditions, the plane crashed into the side of the Superga hill, killing all 31 people on board. Among the dead were 18 of Torino\u2019s first-team players, its coaches, Italian sports journalists, and flight crew. It remains one of the biggest sporting disasters in history and immediately wiped out one of the greatest teams Italian football has ever known. That Torino side, affectionately known as \u2018Grande Torino\u2019 due to its incredible success, had been on the brink of securing a fifth straight Italian league title, while its players also formed the backbone of the Italian national team at the time. The impact on the city and its people was devastating. Author Roberto Pennino spent years interviewing those affected and recounts the sense of loss in his book \u2018Immortal Torino,\u2019 which has been released in English for the 75th anniversary of the disaster. \u201cThese players who perished on Superga, they were really approachable,\u201d Pennino tells CNN. \u201cYou could see them all over town. They went to the same restaurants, to the same cinemas, to the same bakeries as their supporters. \u201cSo when they perished, they were \u2013 as a team \u2013 missed deeply, but also in the city itself. All the places they would be seen, and people could have a chat with them. A lot of people felt like they lost a relative.\u201d On top of the emotional scars that remain visible even 75 years later, Pennino says the sporting cost for Torino was \u201cdisastrous.\u201d The club didn\u2019t have the money or transfer coffers it does today. All of Torino\u2019s capital was on the pitch, Pennino explains. It\u2019s players. Clubs were supportive during Torino\u2019s plight. To an extent. Other Italian teams loaned \u2013 and even gave \u2013 players to Torino, Pennino says. \u201cBut never the best players, of course,\u201d he adds. Club president Feruccio Novo tried desperately to rebuild the team but would never achieve his goal. \u201cHe had an idea to make a second \u2018Grande Torino\u2019 and to buy stars, to honor those players, but also to keep up the with the results they had,\u201d Pennino says. But there was no money, and the support from other teams just wasn\u2019t enough. After winning five straight championships, Torino has won the first division title just once in the intervening 75 years, lifting the trophy in 1975-76. \u2018Forza ragazzi\u2019 Still trying to process what Lanati had told him, Motto remained in denial. Surely, this was impossible, he thought. He had just been on Superga and heard and saw nothing. Lanati sat Motto down by the radio and told him to listen. The next news report confirmed the tragedy. As the minutes and hours slowly ticked on, more and more people affiliated with the club began to arrive at the headquarters; the rest of the youth team, the players\u2019 wives and, finally, club president Novo. Motto remembers Novo, who only missed the trip to Lisbon due to an illness, had to be physically held up by two fans as he entered the building. \u201cHe was literally destroyed,\u201d Motto says. \u201cLike all of us.\u201d Motto says Novo considered the team more like sons than players. Some journalists had also managed to make it into the building, Motto recalls, and were asking questions to those present. They were met with only silence. \u201cNo one had the courage to speak,\u201d Motto says. \u201cBecause we understood that faced with a situation like this, there is no possibility of conversation.\u201d Days later, the players\u2019 families received the postcards they had been sent while the team was in Lisbon, a poignant detail that Pennino says still gives him goosebumps. With just four matches of the season remaining, the rest of the league and the Italian federation agreed to award Torino the title, but the team still needed to finish the season. The federation accepted a proposal from Torino that it would play its youth team, the champions of Italy at the time, against the youth teams of its four remaining opponents. Before the first match against Genoa \u2013 just 11 days after the crash \u2013 Motto remembers Novo coming into the changing room and hugging each player individually, before telling them: \u201cBoys, your masters are watching you.\u201d Even the referee had words of encouragement, according to Motto. \u201cForza ragazzi,\u201d the referee told the Torino players: \u201cCome on, boys.\u201d As the captain of the youth team, Motto was also made captain for the remaining four matches and led the team out onto the pitch against Genoa at the Stadio Filadelfia. Motto had made it. His dream was fulfilled. Only it had come in the most unimaginable of circumstances. Torino\u2019s youth players beat Genoa 4-0 in an atmosphere Motto has never forgotten. The level of noise usually only reserved for a goal boomed from the stands with every pass the team made. After beating Genoa, Torino went on to earn victories over Palermo, Sampdoria and Fiorentina in the final games of the season. \u201cThey honored their mentors in the best possible way,\u201d Pennino says. As many as 700,000 fans are estimated to have lined the streets as the players\u2019 caskets were driven through the city just two days after the crash. Today, the club continues to honor its heroes and will hold a service on Saturday, the 75th anniversary of the disaster, at the Monumental Cemetery in Turin, where some of the players are buried. Later that afternoon, there will be a mass in the Superga Basilica before the day finishes with a service at the Torino FC memorial at the top of the hill. \u201cThey are still remembered every year,\u201d Pennino says. \u201cOn May 4, the names are exclaimed on the Superga Hill. It\u2019s a worthy tribute to those great players.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/04/sport/grande-torino-superga-disaster-75th-anniversary-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_sport_scottie-scheffler-detained", "text": "The world\u2019s top-ranked golfer, Scottie Scheffler, was arrested, charged with felony assault and released from jail before shooting a stellar 5-under par at the PGA Championship on Friday in a whirlwind few hours that upended the typically staid world of professional golf. \u201cI feel like my head is still spinning. I can\u2019t really explain what happened this morning. I did spend some time stretching in a jail cell. That\u2019s a first for me,\u201d Scheffler said Friday afternoon. \u201cI was fortunate to be able to make it back out and play some golf today.\u201d Scheffler, 27, was attempting to drive to the Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Kentucky, for the second round of the tournament at about 6 a.m. when he came to the scene of a fatal crash. He allegedly injured a police officer who was directing traffic and was then detained and arrested, according to police. Scheffler was charged with felony second-degree assault on a police officer, along with lesser charges of third-degree criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding signals from officers directing traffic, according to Jefferson County court records. He was released from jail and returned to the golf course for his tee time. Shortly after 10 a.m., he struck his first tee shot of the day, earning a round of applause from the crowd, and birdied the first hole. Scheffler began Friday tied for 12th place at 4-under par. After his arrest, he shot 5-under par in the second round and was tied for third place when he finished play. The arrest of the World No. 1 golfer \u2013 known as an \u201cupright, outstanding\u201d player who became a father just days ago \u2013 dramatically shook up one of golf\u2019s major tournaments. Scheffler won his second Masters title last month and\u00a0was the overwhelming favorite in the PGA Championship. Scheffler\u2019s attorney told CNN he plans to plead not guilty to the charges. In a statement, Scheffler called the incident a \u201cbig misunderstanding.\u201d \u201cThis morning, I was proceeding as directed by police officers.\u00a0It was a very chaotic situation, understandably so considering the tragic accident that had occurred earlier, and there was a big misunderstanding of what I thought I was being asked to do,\u201d he said in a statement on Instagram.\u00a0\u201cI never intended to disregard any of the instructions.\u00a0I\u2019m hopeful to put this to the side and focus on golf today.\u201d Speaking after his round, Scheffler declined to comment further on the specifics of what led to the arrest but said he believed it would be \u201cresolved fairly quickly.\u201d Scheffler said he was \u201cpretty rattled\u201d by the arrest and that his heart rate was up during play. Still, he praised the officers at the jail, who he said made jokes while he was fingerprinted, and said he was grateful for the police. What led to the arrest The incident began when Scheffler drove to the Valhalla Golf Club for the second round of the tournament around 6 a.m., according to ESPN\u2019s Jeff Darlington, who witnessed and filmed the arrest. Earlier in the morning, a pedestrian had been fatally struck by a bus while trying to cross the main road leading to the course, Louisville Metro Police Department spokesperson Dwight Mitchell said. Because of that, there was an increased police presence around the course\u2019s entrance. When Scheffler arrived in a marked player courtesy vehicle, he tried to drive around the crash scene on a median, according to ESPN, which first reported Scheffler\u2019s detention. \u201cA police officer instructed Scheffler to stop, but Scheffler continued to drive about 10 to 20 yards toward the entrance,\u201d ESPN said. \u201cScheffler then stopped his vehicle at the entrance to Valhalla. The police officer then began to scream at Scheffler to get out of the car. When Scheffler exited the vehicle, the officer shoved Scheffler against the car and immediately placed him in handcuffs,\u201d Darlington posted on X. Police escorted a handcuffed Scheffler into a police vehicle, Darlington\u2019s video shows. \u201cRight now he\u2019s going to jail,\u201d an officer at the scene says in the video. According to a Louisville Metro Police report, Scheffler was trying to gain access to the golf course when he was stopped by an officer wearing a full police uniform and a yellow reflective rain jacket. The officer, identified as Det. Bryan Gillis, stopped Scheffler and attempted to give instructions. \u201cSubject refused to comply and accelerated forward, dragging Detective Gillis to the ground,\u201d the report states. The detective suffered pain, swelling and abrasions to his left wrist and knee and was taken to the hospital for further treatment, the report states. His uniform pants, valued at about $80, \u201cwere damaged beyond repair,\u201d the report adds. In a statement Saturday, Louisville police echoed what Mayor Craig\u00a0Greenberg previously told CNN Saturday, saying there is no body camera footage showing the arrest of Scheffler. There is also no body cam video showing the beginning of the interaction, the mayor previously said. \u201cThe incident is under review internally and will proceed through the judicial process. We would like to restate that all parties involved are fully cooperating. LMPD is committed to a thorough investigation for all involved,\u201d the agency told CNN on Saturday. Meanwhile, other camera angles of the incident and arrest are still being reviewed by officials, Greenberg told CNN. It is not clear whether Gillis was wearing a body camera when he stopped Scheffler and, if he was, why it was not recording. The agency\u2019s policy requires officers wear body cameras \u201cwhen responding to any call for service \u2026 prior to arriving on-scene and exiting their vehicle.\u201d The LMPD did not respond to questions about whether any department policies were violated during the incident. Attorney says Scheffler \u2018did not do anything wrong\u2019 Scheffler\u2019s attorney, Steven Romines, told CNN in a statement Friday that Scheffler was headed to the golf course to prepare for his tee time at the\u00a0PGA Championship. \u201cDue to the combination of event traffic and a traffic fatality in the area it was a very chaotic situation. He was proceeding as directed by another traffic officer and driving a marked player\u2019s vehicle with credentials visible,\u201d Romines said. \u201cIn the confusion, Scottie is alleged to have disregarded a different officer\u2019s traffic signals resulting in these charges.\u201d Romines says multiple eyewitnesses have confirmed that Scheffler \u201cdid not do anything wrong\u201d but drove as directed. \u201cHe stopped immediately upon being directed to and never at any point assaulted any officer with his vehicle,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cWe will plead not guilty and litigate this matter as needed.\u201d Scheffler\u2019s arraignment is scheduled for Tuesday. PGA of America, the organizer of the PGA Championship, identified the pedestrian who died in the earlier crash as John Mills, a worker with a vendor for the\u00a0organization. \u201cOur primary concern today remains with the family of John Mills, who lost his life in a tragic accident early this morning while reporting to work,\u201d the organization said. \u201cAs it relates to the incident involving Scottie Scheffler, we are fully cooperating as local authorities review what took place. While the legal process plays out, questions should be directed to Scheffler\u2019s attorney or local authorities.\u201d In separate statements, both the Louisville mayor and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear offered condolences to the victim\u2019s family and described the ensuing incident with Scheffler and police as \u201cunfortunate.\u201d \u201cLMPD is fully investigating this incident and the legal process will proceed.\u00a0We appreciate everyone\u2019s cooperation,\u201d Mayor Greenberg said. The man\u2019s death \u201ctruly puts everything in perspective,\u201d Scheffler said in his statement. Scheffler became father days ago Scheffler\u2019s arrest represents a stark contrast from his clean image, said David Dusek, senior writer at Golfweek. \u201cScottie Scheffler is one of the most squeaky clean, upright, outstanding, well-respected players out here on the PGA Tour,\u201d Dusek said. \u201cHe is someone who is known for having a very calm, level head on the golf course and he keeps that when he\u2019s off the golf course as well.\u201d After a stellar 2023 campaign that saw him retain the PGA Tour\u2019s Player of the Year title, Scheffler this season has only consolidated his status as the dominant force in men\u2019s golf. Just one week after a\u00a0commanding victory at The Arnold Palmer Invitational, he mounted a stunning late charge to become the\u00a0first player to ever defend The Players Championship.

According to MLB.com, Blanco said he had put rosin on his left arm and it made its way into the glove because he was sweating. Players are permitted to use sweat and rosin, which helps to grip the ball, on their hands, but too much of either substance is illegal in the MLB and could lead to an ejection. Astros general manager Dana Brown told reporters that Blanco had initially wanted to appeal the decision but has since decided not to. \u201cThis is an umpire\u2019s judgement.

{"id": "2024_05_18_sport_masters-golf-employee-steals-merchandise-memorabilia-spt-intl", "text": "A former employee of the Augusta National Golf Club (ANGC) in Georgia has pleaded guilty to stealing millions worth of Masters Tournament merchandise and memorabilia. Richard Globensky, 39, admitted in a federal court in Chicago that he repeatedly stole items while employed as a warehouse assistant by the club between 2009 and 2022, according to court documents from the US District Court Northern District of Illinois Eastern Division. According to Globensky\u2019s plea deal, he stole memorabilia of historical significance such as the green jackets won by Masters champions Arnold Palmer, Gene Sarazen, and Ben Hogan. The green jacket is awarded to the winner of the tournament each year and must be returned to the clubhouse after the winner\u2019s year-long reign as champion is over. Other memorabilia Globensky stole included documents and letters written and signed by tournament co-founder Bobby Jones, historic Masters Tournament records, an Augusta National clubhouse trophy, tickets and programs and an unissued stock that go as far back as 1932, the year the club was founded, according to court documents. He also stole merchandise including t-shirts, jackets, hats, flags and watches among other items, the documents state. Globensky sold the merchandise for around $5.3 million to an online broker in Florida, while the memorabilia were sold for nearly $300,000 to the same broker and an associate, according to prosecutors. The items were then resold at significant markups from what the broker had paid. Globensky was charged with transporting and transferring stolen goods in interstate commerce and deemed responsible for almost $3.5 million in actual loss to the club, according to the documents. Globensky\u2019s plea deal states that he \u201ctook steps to conceal his involvement in the theft and sale\u201d of the merchandise. The document goes on to state that using his knowledge as a warehouse employee, Globensky made sure the number of goods he stole fell below the club\u2019s auditing risk thresholds and also instructed the broker to issue the majority of the payments in the name of his wife, rather than to him directly. Later, court documents state, Globensky established an LLC to collect payment for the stolen items. As part of his plea agreement, Globensky must provide the government with a $1.5 million check within seven days of the guilty plea, which was made on Wednesday. The plea deal also states that Globensky must forfeit the $5.3 million he made off of the stolen goods. According to a press release by the United States Attorney\u2019s Office, the conviction is punishable by up to 10 years in federal prison. Prosecutors indicated in the plea deal that, barring any major change in Globensky\u2019s cooperation, they will ask that the former golf club employee serve between 24 and 30 months in prison. Globensky is scheduled to be sentenced on October 29. Globensky\u2019s attorney, Tom Church, told CNN that they \u201clook forward to telling the full story before sentencing and shining a light on the upright family man that Mr.Globensky is, and has always been, notwithstanding the past mistakes he has made.\u201d He also confirmed that the case was brought in Chicago because some of the stolen goods were later recovered there. CNN has contacted Augusta National for further comment. Held annually in April, The Masters is one of the landmark events of the sporting calendar as one of golf\u2019s four major tournaments, alongside the PGA Championship, the U.S. Open and the Open Championship. Unlike the other majors, The Masters is played at the same course every year, with Augusta National hosting the event since the year it was founded. American Scottie Scheffler is the reigning champion, having taken a dominant four-shot victory in April this year to reclaim the title he previously won in 2022.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/sport/masters-golf-employee-steals-merchandise-memorabilia-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2023_10_30_sport_enhanced-games-olympics-doping-spt-intl", "text": "The 2024 Olympics are fast approaching and as athletes gear up for one of the world\u2019s most prestigious sporting events, one entrepreneur has a different idea of what \u201cfaster, higher, stronger\u201d \u2013 the former motto of the Games \u2013 might represent. The Enhanced Games says it is an \u201calternative\u201d to what it calls the \u201ccorrupt Olympics Games.\u201d Athletes competing at the Enhanced Games will be free to use performance-enhancing drugs, they won\u2019t be tested and will be under no obligation to declare which substances they have taken in order to compete. That\u2019s quite a contrast to the Olympics\u2019 doping protocols. The International Testing Agency (ITA) will be responsible for looking after Paris 2024\u2019s anti-doping program. Six years ago, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which oversees the Olympics, delegated its entire clean sport program to the ITA. However, historically the Olympic Games have been dogged by a series of doping and kickback scandals. When approached for comment on the Enhanced Games and allegations of corruption, the IOC told CNN Sport that \u201cthe idea does not merit any comment.\u201d \u2018Danger to health, to sport\u2019 CNN Sport interviewed a number of experts in the field of doping for this story, who expressed concern that the Enhanced Games was an extremely dangerous proposition. Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, who exposed Russia\u2019s state-sponsored doping program \u2013 a massive, years-long effort which benefited more than 1,000 athletes between 2011 and 2015 \u2013 said that the Enhanced Games is a \u201cdanger to health, to sport.\u201d Whether the Enhanced Games will ever take place remains an open question, but the very idea is drawing considerable blowback from leading anti-doping officials and sporting organizations. The Enhanced Games is the brainchild of businessman Aron D\u2019Souza. He is also the founding editor of \u201cThe Journal Jurisprudence,\u201d a quarterly publication on legal philosophy, according to his website, which also describes him as an \u201cavid athlete.\u201d Recently, D\u2019Souza told CNN Sport he has \u201csigned term sheets with prominent venture capital firms\u201d in relation to the Enhanced Games and is \u201cwaiting on the lawyers to finish long-form drafting.\u201d He also said that a funding announcement is planned for early December. Although not legally binding, term sheets are a serious expression of intent by both sides, setting out the broad principles of an agreement. D\u2019Souza believes what he calls a \u201cscience-driven\u201d competition is the next step in the evolution of sport, suggesting that the absence of drug testing will level the playing field. According to a 2020 study from Raphael Faiss, Research Manager at the centre of Research and Expertise in anti-doping sciences at the University of Lausanne, data from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) suggests less than 2% of athletes dope. However, Faiss told CNN Sport the number of athletes taking performance-enhancing drugs is likely significantly higher; his research, based on two international major athletic events in 2011 and 2013, suggests the figure could be between 15 to 18%. Faiss and his team compared athletes\u2019 blood results collected by WADA-accredited labs to values from healthy adults, as well as doped and undoped athletes; the closer the values are to those of subjects to whom erythropoietin (EPO, which is used in blood doping) had been administered, the higher the chances that they\u2019re actually doping. This analysis, Faiss said, is not proof of doping, but is a \u201crobust way\u201d of analyzing the data, allowing scientists to make an estimate for doping prevalence, as well as targeting athletes most likely to be doping. In written comments to CNN Sport, WADA said: \u201cDetermining the level of [doping] prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed,\u201d explaining that, since 2017, a \u201cprevalence working group\u201d has been established to \u201cdetermine if strategies, reliable methods and tools can be developed to adequately assess the prevalence of doping in sports.\u201d WADA told CNN Sport that the group has delivered \u201cseveral recommendations and guidance to WADA but not the final ones yet.\u201d WADA has reservations about Faiss\u2019 study and pointed to the \u201ccomplexity of trying to measure [doping] prevalence,\u201d highlighting that reports have \u201cgreatly varying results.\u201d The anti-doping organization added: \u201cNo single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline.\u201d \u201cComparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system\u2019s testing figures isn\u2019t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence. \u201cIn any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries \u2013 it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others. \u201cThe Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures.\u201d Editor\u2019s note: You can find WADA\u2019s full statement at the bottom of this article.\u00a0 \u2018A dangerous clown show\u2019 Travis Tygart, the Chief Executive Officer at the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), told CNN Sport that the idea of an Enhanced Games is \u201cfarcical \u2026 likely illegal in many [US] states\u201d and \u201ca dangerous clown show, not real sport.\u201d Substances such as anabolic steroids \u2013 which help to build muscle mass by enabling athletes to train harder and recover quickly from strenuous workouts \u2013 are classified as a Schedule III drug by the US Drug Enforcement Administration. When asked whether anabolic steroids will be allowed at the games and whether athletes would be tested for illegal drugs such as cocaine, D\u2019Souza told CNN Sport that \u201cwe will not be drug testing at the games.\u201d He added: \u201cWe do not propose to regulate what athletes use.\u201d Anabolic steroids may be prescribed by a licensed physician for the treatment of certain conditions such as testosterone deficiency, but if used in the US without a prescription from a licensed physician, a first conviction could result in a one-year prison sentence and a $1,000 fine. But that isn\u2019t the only potential legal jeopardy the Enhanced Games faces, according to American lawyer Jim Walden, who represents Russian whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov. \u201cIf you look at the Enhanced Games website, it\u2019s almost as though they\u2019re advertising their disregard of the law,\u201d Walden told CNN Sport. \u201cThey wrap themselves up in what I will call the cloak of legitimacy by using phrases like body autonomy and coming out as an enhanced athlete. \u201cI hope they\u2019re thinking hard about how they\u2019re going to pull this off in the world in which the FBI has a specific unit that is called the Sports and Gaming Initiative that\u2019s focusing on these very issues.\u201d The Sports and Gaming Initiative was developed to \u201cprotect athletes and sporting institutions in the United States from criminal threats and influences,\u201d according to the government website. The initiative works in partnership with sports leagues and governing bodies, international law enforcement and independent watchdog groups to tackle crimes such as fraud, doping and match-fixing; criminal activities, it says, \u201cdegrade the integrity of sports and competition and erode public confidence in these cherished institutions.\u201d \u201cThe use of doping substances is not acceptable in modern sports,\u201d Rodchenkov said in his written comments to CNN. \u201cPromotion and advertising of banned substances is against sport rules and moral, letter and spirit. \u201cIt might bring an extreme harm to young generation[s] of athletes who mistakenly could believe in benefits of [the] Enhanced Games.\u201d Rodchenkov, the protagonist of the Oscar-winning Netflix documentary Icarus who is currently under FBI protection, also believes that the Enhanced Games\u2019 organizers \u201cmight get investigated [\u2026] under the Rodchenkov Act.\u201d The Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act, named after the whistleblower, allows the US to impose criminal sanctions on individuals involved in doping activities at international events. However, the Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act does not apply to sporting events that don\u2019t adopt the WADA code, which the Enhanced Games wouldn\u2019t do. Rodchenkov also added that WADA athletes could not have any affiliation or contact with so-called enhanced athletes, or they would risk being charged under Article 2.10 \u2013 \u201cProhibited Association by an Athlete or Other Person\u201d \u2013 of the World Anti-Doping Code. USADA\u2019s Tygart also told CNN Sport: \u201cNo one really wants our children growing up idolizing unbridled drug use in sport, even if some profiteers think otherwise.\u201d D\u2019Souza insists his motivation for founding the Enhanced Games isn\u2019t financial. If he had wanted to make more money, he says he\u2019d continue to be a \u201cquiet, mild-mannered venture capitalist.\u201d \u201cI do think fundamentally that consumers want this [the Enhanced Games] and athletes want this because if you go to the cinemas, no one\u2019s interested in histories in the past anymore,\u201d said D\u2019Souza. \u201cThey\u2019re interested in superheroes and technology in the future. And this is literally what we are bringing to a reality.\u201d \u2018The dirtiest Olympics in history\u2019 According to Pierre de Coubertin \u2013 the founder of the modern Olympics \u2013 \u201cfor every man, woman and child, it [sport] offers an opportunity for self-improvement.\u201d Except historically, many athletes competing in the Olympics have taken the idea of self-improvement too far, notably at London 2012, which Rodchenkov has previously called \u201cthe dirtiest Olympics in history.\u201d When the ITA concluded its re-analysis program for the London Games, it found 73 anti-doping rule violations, which led to the withdrawal of 31 medals and reallocation of 46 Olympic medals across the sports of athletics, weightlifting, wrestling and canoeing. Doping has been an issue at the Olympics throughout the event\u2019s history, and the 100-meter final at the 1988 Games has become one of the most infamous and controversial moments in sporting history. Six of the eight finalists \u2013 notably the winner, Ben Johnson \u2013 who lined up on that September day in Seoul 35 years ago would fail drug tests themselves or be implicated in drug use during their careers. Despite some athletes continuing to cheat, global antidoping efforts remain ever-present, according to the testers. Recent out-of-competition (OOC) testing data published by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) highlights positive results from steps being taken to keep \u201celite podiums and finals clean,\u201d according to the anti-doping organization. Data focused on OOC testing ahead of last year\u2019s World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon, shows how resources and testing are targeting those athletes most likely to win medals and make finals. Whilst only 39% of the athletes in Eugene had three or more OOC tests in the 10 months leading up the event, 81% of top-eight finishers had three or more OOC tests. Yet the cat and mouse game between testers and athletes using banned substances continues. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly about the question of timing and targeting the right athletes,\u201d said Faiss. Given that athletes have their blood values regularly monitored, it is \u201cgetting more difficult for athletes to use high doses [of drugs such as EPO], but they would still be using micro dosing.\u201d By taking EPO late at night and drinking enough water, the substance would not be detected in athletes the following morning, according to Faiss, though athletes suspected of blood doping could be tested in the middle of the night. \u201cAthletes are actually getting back to very simple ways of doping with steroids,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cEPO is quite simple to use, but still tricky to detect.\u201d Athletes \u201cuse the drugs that are actively working.\u201d When it comes to new substances such as Roxadustat \u2013 the drug that two-time grand slam champion Simona Halep has recently been given a four-year ban for taking, although she denies ever knowingly or intentionally taking any prohibited substance \u2013 Faiss said athletes \u201care likely to use substances with a very short half-life in [the] body that are mimicking processes of the oxygen carrying improvements through the EPO channels.\u201d Roxadustat has an elimination half-life of 10-16 hours, according to the National Institutes of Health. Athletes are \u201cseeking to find substances where the [half-life] time window is very short, to make sure that if they are not tested at the right moment, they won\u2019t be caught,\u201d said Faiss. \u2018Challenge for sporting competition\u2019 Michele Verroken, the founding director of consultancy group Sporting Integrity, believes an antidoping system is required that will \u201cgive a lot more credibility, a lot more immediacy to verifying results, if we\u2019re going to keep the hearts and minds of athletes.\u201d Verroken also questions what\u2019s stopping an athlete from cheating if they only get caught 10 years after the event, or not at all. Under the World Anti-Doping Code, there is a 10-year statute of limitations on samples taken from 2015 onwards. Verroken told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games is \u201csetting a really interesting challenge for sporting competition.\u201d Not unsurprisingly, many sporting bodies have condemned the event. The Australian Olympic Committee called it \u201cdangerous and irresponsible,\u201d saying that \u201cthe world needs better than this.\u201d UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) said it \u201cis extremely concerned by the concept of an Enhanced Games,\u201d adding that \u201cthere is no place in sport for performance enhancing drugs, nor the Enhanced Games.\u201d UKAD\u2019s Director of Operations, Hamish Coffey, told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games sets a \u201chugely dangerous precedent,\u201d expressing concern over the kind of messaging the event sends to the next generation of athletes. \u2018Very accomplished athletes\u2019 When CNN Sport spoke to D\u2019Souza shortly after the proposed event\u2019s announcement, he said that 368 athletes had enquired about the Enhanced Games and more had messaged via social media. The organization\u2019s Chief Athletes Officer and former Olympian Brett Fraser, who swam for the Cayman Islands at three Olympic Games, told CNN Sport that \u201cvery accomplished athletes\u201d at the level of Olympic finalists have reached out \u201cto understand more about how the first Games will take place and how they can become involved.\u201d Fraser added that Enhanced Games organizers \u201calready have an Olympic medallist\u201d for their athlete commission, though he didn\u2019t specify who that was. He also said there has been \u201ca lot of positive feedback and a lot of acceptance and excitement from younger generations.\u201d Nonetheless, none of the athletes appear prepared to speak publicly at this stage. For those who do want to compete, the Enhanced Games would be an annual event with five categories \u2013 track and field, swimming, weightlifting, gymnastics and martial arts. The huge cost of hosting an Olympic Games is no secret, with countries often striving to create bigger and better spectacles by blowing their budget. Tokyo 2021 had the largest Olympic sports program in history, with 33 sports competitions in 42 venues culminating in 339 medal events. The Covid-impacted Games were delivered with a final expenditure of $13 billion \u2013 almost double the $7.3 billion that was originally forecast. Meanwhile, keeping the IOC\u2019s philosophy of \u201clower-impact Games\u201d in mind, 95% of venues will be pre-existing facilities at the Paris 2024 Olympics. D\u2019Souza said the Enhanced Games will focus on fewer sports, reuse existing infrastructure and fund the event through the private sector to \u201cdeliver a high-impact yet cost-efficient games\u201d so profits can be shared with the athletes. He added that the Enhanced Games is looking for a seven-figure prize pool for any athlete potentially breaking Usain Bolt\u2019s 100-meter world record of 9.58 seconds. \u201cI\u2019ve had conversations with people who are top-10 sprinters in the world who are going to the next Olympics, and they said [\u2026] if there\u2019s a million-dollar prize to break the 100m world record, I\u2019ll be there,\u201d said D\u2019Souza. Universal basic income and mental health support to athletes will also be part of an \u201cenhanced athletes programme.\u201d When asked who would take responsibility if an athlete competing at the Enhanced Games were to suffer fatal consequences, D\u2019Souza told CNN Sport that \u201cour athletes at the games will be the most monitored athletes in history.\u201d He said: \u201cWe will focus on athlete safety by mandating athletes have pre-competition full-system clinical screenings including blood tests and EKGs.\u201d \u201cThis will ensure that athletes are healthy to complete and not at risk of major health complications.\u201d D\u2019Souza also said that athletes will sign waivers in order\u00a0to compete. As it stands, no venues are officially in place to host the event and D\u2019Souza admits its scale will be dependent on funding and media partnerships. \u201cWe\u2019re in commercial negotiations with venues and media partners at the moment,\u201d added D\u2019Souza, who said the first Enhanced Games will be at a university campus or a similar facility in the south of the US and that a number of trademarks have been filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. \u2018Undermine the very purpose of sport\u2019 Elite performance coach Trevor Painter, who has worked with a number of Olympic and international sprinters and middle-distance runners, said he would \u201cnever\u201d coach an athlete taking performance-enhancing drugs because it would go against his morals as a coach. \u201cHaving been involved with many athletes that have lost in many ways to the cheats, I won\u2019t be engaging with [the Enhanced Games],\u201d Painter told CNN Sport. If it goes ahead as planned in December 2024, D\u2019Souza insists that the Enhanced Games will unlock the potential of humanity. But according to John William Devine, Senior Lecturer in Ethics, Sport and Exercise Sciences at Swansea University in Wales, the Enhanced Games will make sporting competition more unfair than it already is and even \u201cundermine the very purpose of the sport in question.\u201d Devine told CNN Sport that \u201cperformance-enhancing drugs don\u2019t actually lead to better athletic performance. They obscure athletic performance.\u201d He added that, although the Enhanced Games may look very similar to the Olympics, the nature of the activity will be different, raising the question: \u201cTo what extent is drug-assisted performance reflective of the athletes\u2019 sporting excellence?\u201d WADA response in full: Determining the level of prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed. That is why we set up a\u00a0Working Group on Doping Prevalence\u00a0in 2017. Measuring doping prevalence is a difficult and complex process. Through its work, the group found a huge variance across the many prevalence studies that have been carried out, leading it to publish guidelines on how to improve the quality of measuring prevalence. WADA is currently developing a tool that Anti-Doping Organizations can use to evaluate the effectiveness of their programs. WADA is well aware of the [Faiss] study. Indeed, one of the contributors, Prof. Martial Saugy, is a member of the Working Group. This study is one of many that helps to inform the Group\u2019s work. It is a very narrow study. It looks at two events, in a single sport, held 10 and 12 years ago, using just one method of measurement (the Athlete Biological Passport (ABP)). As far as I am aware, there is no comparable data from more recent World Championships in the same sport. Given its limited scope, it is important that this study be analyzed within the wider context of other studies and not be taken in isolation. This study also highlights the complexity of trying to measure prevalence. It is the third published paper that sought to measure prevalence at the 2011 Athletics World Championships. Each reported greatly varying results. The fact is no single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline. Results will always come with caveats and margins of error and will be based on a variety of methods, including self-report questionnaires, analytical methods (like ABP and testing data) and other methods to give a more rounded estimate of what the most likely figure would be. Comparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system\u2019s testing figures isn\u2019t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence. In any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries \u2013 it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others. The Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/10/30/sport/enhanced-games-olympics-doping-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Despite the Arab nation\u2019s poor human rights record, Saudi Arabia\u2019s spending spree to turn its domestic soccer league into a star-studded, bona fide competition shows the seriousness of its ambition. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman says he doesn\u2019t \u201ccare\u201d about the country\u2019s investment in sport being described as sportswashing. \u201cWell if sportswashing is going to increase my GDP by one percent, then I will continue doing sportswashing,\u201d MBS said in an\u00a0interview\u00a0with Fox News which aired Wednesday. Pressed on if he was bothered by the use of the term, MBS continued: \u201cI don\u2019t care. I have one percent GDP growth from sport, and I am aiming for another one and a half percent. Call it whatever you want, we\u2019re going to get that one and a half percent.\u201d Saudi clubs, several of which have been taken over by the nation\u2019s sovereign Public Investment Fund (PIF), have already attracted some of the biggest names in the sport. By attracting some of the world\u2019s biggest stars to the Gulf states, the SPL wants \u201cto drive competitiveness on and off the pitch,\u201d though it\u2019s keen to emphasize that these overseas players will help develop \u201cyoung Saudi talent.\u201d During this summer transfer window, the government-controlled PIF increased the cumulative value of these four clubs nearly five times, making them the most valuable in the country, according to estimates by the sports website Transfermarkt. Plenty of other leading stars have eagerly said yes to the SPL, notably 2022 Ballon D\u2019Or winner Karim Benzema joining Al-Ittihad at the end of his contract with Spanish soccer giant Real Madrid. As the European transfer window came to a close, the four PIF-owned teams have spent nearly $900 million (\u20ac835.1 million) on buying elite international players, Transfermarkt data shows, which ranked them in the top 20 clubs in the world by transfer expenditure, alongside soccer giants from England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy. Al Hilal alone paid more than $378 million (\u20ac353 million), more than PSG and Arsenal, making it the second-largest spender this year. The newly acquired players join five-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, who has a two-year contract with Al-Nassr where he will earn a staggering estimated $200 million a year, according to Saudi state-owned media, currently making him the world\u2019s highest paid soccer player. As of today, 21 of the most expensive soccer players in Saudi Arabia by transfer fees \u2013 all international stars \u2013 play for one of the PIF-owned clubs. Despite the financial outlay, the SPL is remaining deliberately tight-lipped about the specifics of its financial gamble, with chief operating officer Carlo Nohra confirming to CNN Sport that it was \u201cnot in [the SPL\u2019s] competitive advantage\u201d to report the salaries offered to players and coaches. The PIF has $777 billion in assets under management, according to its most recent filing, with ambitions to top $1 trillion within a few years. In 2021, it acquired English soccer club Newcastle United, before focusing on investments at home. The club is now also among top spenders on players. Saudi clubs not owned by the PIF are also splurging on big-ticket players, with former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson, 33, offered an eye-watering salary of $870,000 (\u00a3700,000) per week, according to multiple reports, in an estimated $15 million (\u00a312 million) transfer from Liverpool to Saudi team Al-Ettifaq. In a recent interview with The Athletic, Henderson said those numbers \u201cjust aren\u2019t true.\u201d \u201cEssentially, the signal is \u2018We mean business,\u2019\u201d Simon Chadwick, a professor of sport and geopolitical economy at SKEMA Business School, told CNN.\u201cWe\u2019ve got so much money that for a player who is \u2026 coming towards the end of his career, we can afford to pay him 700,000 [GB pounds a week], or whatever it is that he\u2019s being paid, and still have Cristiano Ronaldo and still be in the market for other players as well,\u201d Chadwick said, describing Saudi\u2019s approach to becoming a sporting superpower, adding that the sky is the limit in terms of cost. Saudi\u2019s love of soccer Saudi Arabia follows in the footsteps of several other countries \u2013 including China and Qatar in investing large sums of money to try and turn themselves into soccer powerhouses. It remains to be seen whether Saudi\u2019s turbocharged investment will have a lasting impact or resemble something like a costly rebranding effort. The Saudi national team has been to multiple World Cups, and the country\u2019s clubs have won multiple Asian titles. Saudi\u2019s victory over Argentina during last year\u2019s men\u2019s World Cup was hailed as one of the greatest upsets in tournament history, with the country\u2019s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud granting a national public holiday in recognition of the win. Club games can attract huge crowds in the Middle Eastern nation. \u201cFor example, Al-Ittihad against Al-Hilal, you\u2019re talking about drawing crowds of 40, 50, 60,000 people, these are games that are comparable in size to Chelsea vs. Arsenal, Manchester United vs. Manchester City,\u201d Chadwick said. Buying star players, some arguably past their prime, also provides an easy win for Saudi teams, according to Kieran Maguire, co-host of \u201cThe Price of Football\u201d podcast. \u201cFrom the Saudi authorities\u2019 point of view, they\u2019re getting a ready-made product. Everybody\u2019s heard of Benzema. Everybody\u2019s heard of Cristiano Ronaldo and so on,\u201d Maguire said. Saudi Arabia\u2019s lofty sporting ambitions don\u2019t end with the SPL or Newcastle United. The country is hosting the 2023 FIFA Club World Cup and is bidding to host the 2027 AFC Asian Cup. Several media reports also indicated that the Gulf kingdom was considering launching a bid for the 2030 FIFA men\u2019s World Cup alongside Greece and Egypt \u2013 although it is reportedly mulling pulling its candidacy. Meanwhile, the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) has agreed to a contract that will see the Spanish Super Cup played in Saudi Arabia until 2029, a deal that will earn the Spanish governing body between \u20ac35-45 million ($38-48 million) a year. Appealing to the youth Saudi Arabia has a very young population: the country\u2019s most recent census revealed 32.2 million people live in the country, nearly 42% of whom are foreign nationals \u2013 and 51% of the Saudi population are under the age of 30.\u202fOf this populace, Saudi authorities say that over 80% play, attend or follow soccer, the national sport. Chadwick explains that Saudi Arabia\u2019s government is concerned with the prospect of its younger members of society becoming radicalized or an anti-government sentiment bubbling up like that of the Arab Spring \u2013 and looks to offer its population a thriving soccer industry to keep it placated. Though the soccer industry generates employment, revenues, export earnings and inward investment, \u201cwhat is just as significant is the security of the royal family,\u201d Chadwick adds. The Arab Spring, a wave of pro-democracy protests that washed over the Middle East and North Africa in 2011, achieved mixed results. Four Arab dictators in Libya, Yemen, Egypt and Tunisia were toppled, offering a brief sense of victory for protesters, but, since then, new wars have prompted a retreat of popular movements in the region. Meanwhile, failed uprisings in Bahrain and eastern Saudi Arabia were followed by years-long crackdowns and a continuing civil war in Syria. \u201cWhat we\u2019re beginning to see in Saudi Arabia right now is the emergence of a new social contract. And the social contract essentially is catering for the needs of the Gen Z population,\u201d Chadwick said. \u201cYou want Ronaldo? You got him. You want some of the best football teams in the world? You got them. You want the World Cup to come to Saudi Arabia? You got it \u2026 But don\u2019t question us,\u201d Chadwick explained. Maguire agrees, noting that investing in soccer \u201ccan be seen as part of a much broader socio-economic plan, run by the Saudi authorities.\u201d At the same time, there has been \u201ca significant increase in the number of Saudi Arabians detained by the authorities, for example, for posting adverse comments on social media about the country\u201d this year, Chadwick told CNN. Human rights group Amnesty International told CNN that it has documented a rollback in human rights in Saudi Arabia, including an escalating crackdown on freedom of expression and an increased use of counterterrorism and cybercrime laws to silence dissent. Between 2022 and 2023, the organization said it has documented an increase in criminal prosecutions compared to previous years. In 2022, Amnesty reported the highest number of annual executions in the country in 30 years, with 196 people killed. \u201cReputation is important in terms of attracting foreign investment, and \u2026 Mohammed bin Salman, as much as he has significant financial muscle, needs foreign investing for the realization of his diversification,\u201d James Dorsey, the author of the syndicated column and blog, \u201cThe Turbulent World of Middle East Soccer,\u201d explains. Saudi Arabia is the world\u2019s biggest exporter of crude oil, and nearly two-thirds of its income still comes from selling fossil fuels. But with oil prices regularly dipping below what the Gulf state needs to balance its budget, it has focused efforts on trying to bring in investment from abroad along with its efforts to raise oil prices. Projections indicate the kingdom has around 20 years to diversify its economy to ensure it is more resilient, according to Chadwick \u2013 not least to fund its Vision 2030 projects, including the $500 billion Neom city, a 106 mile-long linear city called The Line and a futuristic plan to revamp the capital. \u201cPart of the grand vision of Mohammed bin Salman, looking forward to 2030, he does have his desire to make Saudi Arabia less dependent on natural resources to look at a post-fuel economy [involving] tourism, entertainment. If Saudi Arabia can become a hub for major sporting events, then that\u2019s a way of attracting interest to the country,\u201d said Maguire. CNN has reached out to the Saudi Ministry of Sport for comment on allegations that the kingdom has been rolling back human rights, and investing in soccer as a way of \u201csportswashing\u201d its image. In response to previous criticism about Saudi Arabia\u2019s purported \u201csportswashing,\u201d the kingdom\u2019s sports minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal said: \u201cPeople that don\u2019t know Saudi Arabia, have never been to Saudi Arabia, go out and talk about it as if they\u2019ve lived there for 30 years, 40 years. So I always tell people, come to Saudi. Come and see Saudi. \u201cSee what it is, see the people, meet the people. Look at what the country is doing for the future of the people in Saudi, then you can criticize as much as you like,\u201d he added. Lack of transparency: Saudi threatens new systems of governance\u202fin sports Saudi Arabia has already disrupted the golf industry and, with soccer, Maguire told CNN, \u201cthey feel that they can do that probably on a smaller scale, but perhaps, ultimately, to generate more interest in terms of eyeballs if they go down the same route.\u201d In 2021, the Saudi government-controlled PIF bankrolled LIV Golf, reportedly at a cost of $2 billion, attracting many of the sport\u2019s top players away from the US-based PGA Tour and Europe-based DP World Tour by offering big dollar prize money, with PGA Tour board member Jimmy Dunne raising fears that they might end up \u201cowning golf.\u201d Earlier this year, the US-based PGA Tour announced it was set to partner with the Saudi-backed breakaway LIV Golf, ending a feud that has dogged the men\u2019s professional game for the past year, with Dunne warning that sport\u2019s governing body had no choice but to reach the truce to retain some measure of control. \u201cThey have an unlimited horizon and an unlimited amount of money,\u201d he said at a contentious Senate hearing on the truce between the two tours. When it comes to soccer, Aleksander Ceferin, president of European football\u2019s governing body UEFA, has dismissed the competitive threat that the SPL could pose. \u201cAs far as I know, Mbappe and [Erling] Haaland don\u2019t dream of Saudi Arabia. I don\u2019t believe that the best players at the pinnacle of their careers would go to Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said last month. \u201cWhen people talk to me about the players who went there, nobody knows where they\u2019re playing.\u201d Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp took a different view, referring to the fact that the Saudi summer transfer window stays open after European clubs see theirs close: \u201cI don\u2019t know how stable it is and I think the next two weeks will show how much of a challenge it is because whatever happens there, no one can react anymore. \u201cI don\u2019t know where it will lead to but it feels rather like a threat or a concern than not because I can\u2019t see how we really deny it in these moments, what can we do?\u201d he added. Still, the new SPL director of football, Michael Emenalo, says what Saudi soccer is doing is \u201cno different from what the Premier League have done.\u201d \u201cThere was a time when it was all about Italy. There was a time when it was all about Spain. What we\u2019re looking for in the industry is an opportunity to compete, and to compete on an even scale and to improve upon whatever exists in the industry,\u201d said Emenalo in a press release sent to CNN. New Saudi Pro League Chief Operating Officer Carlo Nohra told CNN that there is logic behind the league\u2019s strategy of money is no object to lure international stars. \u201cWe can\u2019t expect to be paying market value to entice people to come here at this early stage in our development.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0But analysts say that the difference lies in the level of transparency, which \u201csimply doesn\u2019t exist in Saudi Arabia,\u201d Chadwick explained to CNN. European soccer governing body UEFA has financial fair play (FFP) rules on teams\u2019 spending, while Major League Soccer in the US has a salary cap for its clubs. Nohra told CNN that, eventually, the country wants 0.3% of its GDP to be from soccer to make it similar to that of the Premier League on the UK economy \u2013 up from its current value of \u201c0.000 something.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve got no chance to get into that figure at present,\u201d Maguire explained, but added that the SPL could perhaps move into the top 10 of the world\u2019s domestic leagues. \u201cThat is feasible given the amount of money that they\u2019re spending.\u201d \u201cI think they\u2019re realistic. They don\u2019t say that they\u2019re going to overtake La Liga or the Premier League or the major European leagues,\u201d Maguire said. When the Peterson Institute for International Economics compared the world\u2019s sovereign wealth funds on criteria including governance, transparency and accountability in 2019, the PIF scored well below average on a measure combining these criteria, and ranked in the bottom 10 out of 64 funds, just above Russian Direct Investment Fund. CNN has reached out to the PIF for further comment about its investments in sport, particularly soccer and golf, and criticisms about its lack of transparency. Chadwick raised concerns over how a lack of financial rules affecting Saudi clubs might dilute UEFA\u2019s FFP regulations, as well as those of the Premier League, or impact world soccer governing body FIFA\u2019s systems of governance. The lack of transparency in Saudi Arabia\u2019s wealth fund has already raised suspicions in the US golfing and political spheres. Earlier this summer, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations launched an inquiry about the PGA Tour\u2019s agreement with the PIF-controlled LIV Golf. Chadwick told CNN that, so long as there is no independent organization that monitors the reporting of every league\u2019s financial endeavors, \u201cnobody really knows for sure what the accurate financial information is.\u201d \u201cThis vacuum [of information], this uncertainty is wrapped in a veneer of lobbying, which is intended to either overinflate or underinflate player transfer values and salary information because it serves a political purpose,\u201d Chadwick says, adding that this purpose is \u201csignaling.\u201d \u201cIt is almost as though football players are becoming kind of geopolitical pawns in some ways.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/09/20/sport/saudi-arabia-soccer-spl-bin-salman-intl-spt-cmd-dg/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_sport_harrison-butker-commencement-speech-analysis-cec", "text": "The NFL is distancing itself from controversial comments by Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker during a recent commencement address. In addition to calling Pride Month a \u201cdeadly sin\u201d and bemoaning diversity and equity initiatives, Butker set off waves of criticism when he suggested that women find more fulfillment through getting married and having children than by pursuing careers \u2013 directly after quoting a song by Taylor Swift. The backlash has been building since Butker made the comments Saturday in an address to graduates at Benedictine College, a small Catholic school in Atchison, Kansas. The NFL issued a statement Wednesday, saying Butker\u2019s comments don\u2019t reflect the views of the league. \u201cHarrison Butker gave a speech in his personal capacity. His views are not those of the NFL as an organization,\u201d said Senior Vice President Jonathan Beane, the league\u2019s chief diversity and inclusion officer. \u201cThe NFL is steadfast in our commitment to inclusion, which only makes our league stronger.\u201d GLAAD also issued a statement calling Butker\u2019s speech \u201ca clear miss\u201d and \u201cwoefully out of step with Americans about Pride, LGBTQ people and women.\u201d The Chiefs, defending Super Bowl champions and one of the NFL\u2019s marquee teams, have not responded to requests for comment. However, plenty of women (and Taylor Swift fans) have made their feelings plainly known, including the sisters of Mount St. Scholastica monastery, a founding institution and sponsor of Benedictine College. \u201cThe sisters of Mount St. Scholastica do not believe that Harrison Butker\u2019s comments in his 2024 Benedictine College commencement address represent the Catholic, Benedictine, liberal arts college that our founders envisioned and in which we have been so invested,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cInstead of promoting unity in our church, our nation, and the world, his comments seem to have fostered division.\u201d Such pushback could keep Butker\u2019s social media feeds clogged with criticism for the foreseeable future. It also could be an optical problem for the NFL and the Chiefs, who have both enjoyed increased support from female fans in the past year. What Butker said about women \u2014 and Taylor Swift In front of the crowd of about 485 male and female graduates, Butker suggested that a woman\u2019s accomplishments in the home are more valuable than any academic or professional goals. \u201cI want to speak directly to you briefly because I think it is you, the women, who have had the most diabolical lies told to you,\u201d he said. \u201cHow many of you are sitting here now about to cross this stage and are thinking about all the promotions and titles you are going to get in your career? Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world.\u201d Butker also praised his wife Isabelle, saying she \u201cwould be the first to say her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother.\u201d Judging from the hundreds upon hundreds of critical comments on Butker\u2019s Instagram posts and about him on X and TikTok, his remarks did not sit well with many people. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a case of foot-in-mouth. It was a well-prepared speech,\u201d wrote columnist Sam McDowell in the Kansas City Star. \u201cWomen listening in the audience, rather than being rewarded with a diploma on graduation day, were made to listen as he promoted the role of homemaker \u2014 not as an acceptable choice, but as their duty as a husband\u2019s servant.\u201d It also didn\u2019t sit well with many people that Butker invoked Swift, the pop star who is dating Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce and who was a frequent sight at Chiefs games this past season, including the Super Bowl. Butker likely became the first person in history to quote a Taylor Swift song while criticizing Catholic priests for catering too much to the feelings of their parishioners. \u201cAs my teammate\u2019s girlfriend says: \u2018Familiarity breeds contempt,\u2019\u201d Butker said at one point, quoting Swift\u2019s song \u201cBejeweled\u201d (and, by extension, a common turn of phrase). Conservative voices have praised Butker\u2019s speech for being \u201c100% correct\u201d and for reflecting his self-professed deep Catholic faith. However, his reference to Swift \u2014 a childless, unmarried superstar and feminist figure who by Butker\u2019s own definition is not living up to her potential \u2014 has prompted additional outcry. Feminists and Taylor Swift fans have fired back Butker, 28, has been with the Chiefs for seven seasons. He kicked four field goals as the Chiefs edged the San Francisco 49ers, 25-22, in February to win the Super Bowl. Before his speech, Butker\u2019s Instagram account was rather innocuous: Mostly photos of his gameday outfits paired with Bible quotes, posed shots next to conservative figures and bits of Christian wisdom, all met with generally hospitable commentary from fans. Now, nearly every recent post on his account has been overrun with insults, some questioning how Butker feels about women like Swift, who have found success outside of marriage and motherhood: \u201cI feel bad for those poor women who looked forward to their graduation and had you inflicted upon them.\u201d \u201cHave a talk with Travis about how you can be successful, masculine AND still incredibly supportive of your girlfriend\u2019s career.\u201d The deluge of criticism reached almost every corner of social media, and people took notice. \u201cAs a woman, does watching Harrison Butker get cooked online count as being in the kitchen,\u201d reads one popular post on X. \u201cI\u2019ll let the Swifties handle Harrison Butker,\u201d reads another. Commenters and social influencers also picked up on another piece of information that appears at odds with Butker\u2019s worldview. His mother, Elizabeth Keller Butker, is a medical physicist at Emory University\u2019s Winship Cancer Institute in Atlanta and holds, among other academic accolades, a degree in chemistry from Smith College, a private women\u2019s liberal arts college in Massachusetts. \u201cWhat does your mom think about your little speech, Harrison?\u201d asked Vicki Chan, a doctor and TikTok creator with more than 500,000 followers. CNN has reached out to Benedictine College, where Butker gave his address, and is awaiting a response. The backlash comes as the NFL is trying to court female fans While the fallout from Butker\u2019s address is messy enough already, there\u2019s another complicating detail to consider. The NFL has tried to woo female fans for years. When Swift began appearing at Chiefs games last fall to support her boyfriend Kelce, female interest in the NFL skyrocketed. Super Bowl LVIII, in which the Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers and the superstar couple shared picture-perfect embraces after the victory, was the most-watched Super Bowl ever. Even NFL commissioner Roger Goodell acknowledged the \u201cTaylor Swift effect\u201d on the season. To many, Butker\u2019s comments are a kick in the face to a burgeoning, and valuable,  demographic of NFL fans. \u201cHey NFL. If you want to continue to grow your female fan base and any other marginalized group (straight white men are already watching your product), come get your boy,\u201d tweeted former \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d reporter Lisa Guerrero. Some commenters also asked the Chiefs to issue a response to Butker\u2019s remarks in the interest of their female fans. So far, the Chiefs have not made a public comment. Butker\u2019s speech contained other polarizing comments While Butker\u2019s remarks about women and Taylor Swift inspired a very specific sort of backlash, critics had plenty to say about the other parts of his speech, too. A few details in particular have stirred up discontent: \u2022 Butker criticized President Joe Biden, who is Catholic, and other unnamed Catholic leaders for \u201cpushing dangerous gender ideologies onto the youth of America\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to transgender rights. \u2022 In a swipe at LGBTQ communities, Butker encouraged graduates to have Catholic pride, but \u201cnot the deadly sin sort of pride that has an entire month dedicated to it.\u201d \u2022 Butker also waded into the DEI debate, saying, \u201cThe world around us says that we should keep our beliefs to ourselves whenever they go against the tyranny of diversity, equity and inclusion.\u201d In response to his comments about diversity, Tennessean reporter Andrea Williams pointed out Butker shares the field with Patrick Mahomes, who is considered one of the best players of his generation and is one of only a handful of Black quarterbacks to win a Super Bowl. \u201cHarrison Butker doesn\u2019t have three Super Bowl rings without Patrick Mahomes,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd without those Super Bowl rings, he doesn\u2019t have the aforementioned praise or platform.\u201d Some women also pointed out that Butker\u2019s understanding of Catholicism \u2014 and what the faith asks of its adherents \u2014 is far from universal. Journalist Yvette Walker wrote a faith-based critique for the Kansas City Star, noting the many women of the Bible who contributed to their communities outside of traditional gender roles. \u201cI hope the women in the audience who didn\u2019t agree with everything Butker said remember that they can think for themselves, read the Bible for themselves, and choose the reasoning God granted to live a full and worthwhile life whether you have a family or not,\u201d she wrote.

Brazil\u2019s bid won 119 votes, FIFA said, while a joint bid from Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany (\u2018BNG\u2019) received 78. The United States and Mexico had initially entered a joint bid, but withdrew it in April, stating that they would instead focus on hosting the tournament in 2031. \u201cCongratulations to Brazil,\u201d FIFA president Gianni Infantino said. \u201cWe will have the best World Cup in Brazil.\u201d Brazil has hosted the men\u2019s World Cup in 1950 and 2014. \u201cWe knew we would be celebrating a victory for South American women\u2019s soccer and world soccer for women,\u201d said Ednaldo Rodrigues, president of the Brazilian Football Confederation, per FIFA. \u201cYou can be sure, with no vanity, we will accomplish the best World Cup for women.\u201d The 2027 World Cup will be the 10th edition of the tournament.

{"id": "2024_05_08_sport_chris-birch-nasa-astronaut-cycling-spt-scn-intl", "text": "Scroll through the athlete profiles on the USA Cycling website and you\u2019ll find someone whose favorite movie is listed as \u201cInterstellar\u201d \u2013 Christopher Nolan\u2019s acclaimed sci-fi adventure released in 2014. \u201cI love realistic space movies \u2026 I\u2019m definitely a nerd,\u201d reads Chris Birch\u2019s answer on her profile page. That response proved prescient: shortly after stepping away from her professional cycling career, the Arizona native was selected from more than 12,000 applicants to join NASA\u2019s astronaut class of 2021. As career sidesteps go, it was an unusual one, though Birch had an extensive background in science with degrees in mathematics, biochemistry and molecular biophysics, and a doctorate in biological engineering. The further she progressed with her application to join NASA, the more convinced she became that she had a future in spaceflight. Interviews with panels of current and former astronauts, she thought, were stimulating, not intimidating, and so too were the selection exercises undertaken with other candidates. \u201cI really just had a blast,\u201d Birch tells CNN Sport. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like an interview at all, it didn\u2019t feel like a test. It was just super fun. And it felt like fun and games for me.\u201d It\u2019s now been close to two and a half years since Birch joined NASA, and in that time, she has practiced for space walks, learned to fly T-38 training jets and developed skills needed to operate the robotic arm on the International Space Station. Her training also involved acquiring expeditionary skills, understanding how to operate the complex systems on the space station, and even becoming proficient in Russian, the language needed to fly the Soyuz spacecraft. When she graduated at Houston\u2019s Johnson Space Center in March, the 37-year-old had few qualms about the unexpected U-turn her career had taken, her appetite for spaceflight keener than ever before. \u201cI absolutely would love to explore off this planet,\u201d says Birch. \u201cI think there\u2019s a pretty good shot that I\u2019ll get to go do science aboard the International Space Station, maybe even get to do some wrenching outside and work on making some upgrades. \u201cIt would be an absolute career highlight to be able to go back to the moon as part of one of the Artemis missions and do science on the moon.\u201d Birch left academia in 2018 to pursue a career in professional cycling, going on to win 11 national titles and represent the US at the world championships on several occasions. It was around the time that she was training to make the team for the postponed Tokyo Olympics that Birch applied to join NASA, and when she missed out on selection for the Games, she decided to throw herself wholly into her new pursuit. Despite the evident differences in cycling and spaceflight, she believes that the same sense of curiosity and wonder has motivated her in both disciplines. \u201cI think there\u2019s something really powerful about being surrounded by a group of people that are all trying deliberately to not walk the path most trodden,\u201d says Birch. \u201cWe\u2019re all looking to push the envelope in some way, and that has always been my driving mantra. The whole reason I pursued a PhD is I wanted to discover something, to build something that had never been done before. \u201cMy fascination with sport was all about seeing how fast we could go. Can we push the human body \u2013 my body, my mind \u2013 farther than I thought I could go? It really was a natural extension of that inner drive for me, if not a slight change in the technical topics.\u201d Joining NASA has meant that Birch\u2019s days of flying around a velodrome at lightning-bolt speeds are over, but her desire to test her physical limits remains. She has turned her focus towards endurance challenges, completing the iconic Leadville Trail 100 mountain bike race \u2013 a 100-mile course with 12,000 feet of elevation gain in Colorado \u2013 last year, as well as racing the Houston Marathon in January. On her radar is an attempt to break the women\u2019s time record for cycling north to south across Montana, some 400 miles on gravel roads. Challenges like that are not so far removed from astronaut training, which involves group expeditions in the field, living in the wilderness for days at a time and learning how to handle stress in a critical, unforgiving environment. \u201cCycling in particular \u2013 it just supports so much suffering,\u201d says Birch. \u201cIt\u2019s a really great avenue to practice mental toughness. It doesn\u2019t cost much, versus for me to go out and fly in a multi-engine jet aircraft is thousands of dollars an hour. \u201cThis is something that I can go do and practice that toughness training, especially if I\u2019m descending on a mountain bike trail, six hours in and I\u2019m really tired \u2013 I\u2019m now making critical handling decisions in response to my environment. \u201cI feel like that translates really well to being able to do that in the jet \u2013 it\u2019s the same mental clarity, mental focus you have to maintain. I think it\u2019s an awesome space to practice that.\u201d Birch is now firmly focused on her first projects since graduating. Recently, that\u2019s involved supporting Artemis II recovery training in the Pacific Ocean, off the coast from California. The Artemis II mission, now scheduled for September 2025 after a delay of several months, aims to send four astronauts on a journey to fly by the moon, and being able to prepare for the safe recovery of the astronauts and the capsule, Birch says, gave an \u201cincredible appreciation for the needs of the crew,\u201d even while she\u2019s still a rookie. There\u2019s no obvious timeline or pathway for when or how she might be able to venture away from planet Earth herself, but it remains a firm ambition in her life and career. \u201cI\u2019m going to prepare for that the same way I would prepare for a race,\u201d says Birch, \u201cshow up every day and give 100% to the team. If the timing works out, then that\u2019s great. But I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/sport/chris-birch-nasa-astronaut-cycling-spt-scn-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Three Olympic all-around champions were set to feature in the field for the first time ever Saturday, with Gabby Douglas and Sunisa Lee \u2013 who collected Olympic golds in 2012 and 2021 respectively \u2013 also competing alongside Biles at the event in Hartford, Connecticut. The last time the three women competed against each other eight years ago at the national championships, Biles came out on top, Douglas finished fourth and Lee finished 10th in the juniors. Since then, all three have achieved enormous success but have each faced their own challenges, adding a comeback quality to their attempts to qualify for Paris, which begin in earnest on Saturday. Despite such a talented field, it is Biles who remains the star attraction. She withdrew from several events at the Tokyo Olympics after suffering from what is known as the \u201ctwisties\u201d \u2013 a mental block causing a gymnast to lose track of their positions midair \u2013 but is now looking to add to her tally of seven Olympic medals at Paris 2024. Biles won a bronze in the balance beam in Tokyo but took an extended break from gymnastics after the Games before returning to the sport last year. Shortly after her return, she won four gold medals, as well as a silver, at the world championships and became the most decorated male or female gymnast ever, surpassing Belarusian Vitaly Scherbo\u2019s record of 33 overall medals across both the Olympics and the world championships. Following Biles\u2019s success at the Core Hydration Classic, the final opportunity for gymnasts to secure a spot along the qualifying road to Paris comes at the national championships in June, where the top performers will be selected for the Olympic Trials. Three-time Olympic gold medalist Douglas, meanwhile, made just her second competitive appearance Saturday since the 2016 Rio Olympics, 10 months after announcing her return to the sport. Douglas realized she missed competing while watching the US national championships in 2022, she told NBC News Now, and decided to resume training. \u201cNow I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m in this sport again,\u201d she added. Douglas, who began the competition on uneven bars, scratched from the remainder of the event following the first rotation and posting a 10.100 after two falls, NBC Olympics reported. Lee has also endured long stretches away from the gym since her Olympic triumph three years ago. Kidney disease threatened to derail her gymnastics career, but treatment allowed her to manage the condition and set her sights on Paris. The example set by Biles has proved inspirational for Lee, she told Reuters last month, helping her to become a lot more open in talking about her mental health. 2022 US national champion Konnor McClain was injured during a warmup on the floor exercise before beginning the second rotation and was taken from the competition floor in a wheelchair, NBC Olympics reported. Biles competed against 13 other medalists from the Olympics, World Championships and/or Pan American Games this weekend, including Tokyo Olympic floor champion Jade Carey and six-time world championship medalist Shilese Jones.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/sport/core-hydration-classic-preview-simone-biles-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_sport_scottie-scheffler-profile-pga-championship-spt-intl", "text": "Scottie Scheffler is a man well-accustomed to making global headlines, but almost never for events beyond the confines of the golf course. The extraordinary scenes that saw the world No.1 arrested outside Kentucky\u2019s Valhalla Golf Club were rendered even more remarkable given his background. This is a golfer, a new father, who has been dominating his sport in unassuming fashion. A devout Christian, he once said he played the sport because he was \u201ctrying to glorify God.\u201d The 27-year-old is the favorite to win the PGA Championship this weekend and arguably not since Tiger Woods in his prime has a player been so superior on the course. \u2018My identity isn\u2019t a golf score\u2019 Born in Ridgewood, New Jersey, but a Dallas native since the age of 6, Scheffler burst onto the golf scene by winning a flurry of junior titles. In 2014, at 17, as an amateur he made a hole-in-one and the cut on his first PGA Tour start. After turning professional four years later, Scheffler was crowned the PGA Tour\u2019s Rookie of the Year in 2020 and made a triumphant Ryder Cup debut the following season. Without a PGA Tour victory heading into 2022, by April of that year he was a four-time victor, the world No. 1 and \u2013 thanks to a dominant display at The Masters \u2013 a major champion. Scheffler coasted to victory at Augusta National that year, a marked contrast to his stress before the final round. \u201cOverwhelmed,\u201d the University of Texas alumni had \u201ccried like a baby\u201d that morning, he later admitted. It was a conversation with wife, Meredith, that helped steady the golfer, he said. The high-school sweethearts had married in 2020, and Scheffler paid tribute to her and his Christian faith after easing into his first green jacket. \u201cThe reason why I play golf is I\u2019m trying to glorify God and all that He\u2019s done in my life.So for me, my identity isn\u2019t a golf score,\u201d Scheffler, who met his current caddie Ted Scott in Bible study, told reporters. \u201cAll I\u2019m trying to do is glorify God and that\u2019s why I\u2019m here \u2026 it\u2019s not about a golf score.\u201d \u2018I feel like I live two separate lives\u2019 Scheffler\u2019s efforts at Augusta helped him to be subsequently crowned the PGA Tour Player of the Year in 2022, a title he defended after a stellar 2023 campaign that saw him tally another two wins. That included a win at The Players Championship, often dubbed \u201cthe fifth major,\u201d in which Scheffler\u2019s 88-year-old grandmother Mary followed him on the course for all 72 holes, achieving internet fame in the process. \u201cGrandma and I are not big on social media, so we actually only found out the other day that she went viral, whatever that must mean,\u201d Scheffler told CNN Sport\u2019s Don Riddell earlier this year. In his winner\u2019s news conference, Scheffler had outlined his celebratory plans to head to his grandmother\u2019s nearby home for dessert.\u00a0It reinforced the world No. 1\u2019s image as the self-effacing star of the PGA Tour, a perception he is content to endorse. Scheffler\u2019s prolific early career has rocketed him to eighth on the all-time list of career earnings on the PGA Tour, not even halfway through his fifth year on the circuit. Yet despite his $61 million in winnings, as recently as 2022 he still drove the same Chevrolet Suburban that his father bought for him when he was in college, clocking some 175,000 miles in the car. Asked by Riddell about his flashiest purchase, Scheffler settled on his home in Dallas. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t really describe my house as extravagant, but that\u2019s definitely our most expensive purchase,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I live two separate lives. I have my life when I\u2019m out here on the road and you\u2019re playing golf in front of people and I\u2019ve got to do interviews and stuff like that. But then when I go home and I go about my life, golf\u2019s not really that crazy of a popular sport. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m quarterback for the [Dallas] Cowboys or anything like that. \u201cSo living life around home is pretty easy for us. Not much has really changed on the home front. But out here, yeah, things have changed a significant amount.\u201d It was a somewhat bittersweet 2023 season, however, as Scheffler narrowly missed out on adding to his major haul before suffering a painful defeat with Team USA at the Ryder Cup, including a match loss so catastrophic in proportion that it left Scheffler in tears. \u2018Family always comes first\u2019 Yet those scenes in Rome seemed a lifetime away after Scheffler\u2019s start to 2024. He has won four times in his last five starts, including a commanding victory at The Arnold Palmer Invitational and a historic first-ever defense of The Players  a week later. Yet the pick of the bunch was a second Masters triumph last month. Scheffler had vowed to leave the tournament if Meredith went into labor but did not receive the call, leaving him a clear run at another green jacket. \u201cMy buddies told me this morning, my victory was secure on the cross,\u201d he said after winning. \u201cI believe that today\u2019s plans were already laid out many years ago, and I could do nothing to mess up those plans. I have been given a gift of this talent, and I use it for God\u2019s glory. That\u2019s pretty much it.\u201d The couple welcomed their first child, Bennett, last week, but not before Scheffler lifted one more trophy, at the RBC Heritage. His 10th PGA Tour title, it made him the first golfer since Woods in 2006 to win a PGA Tour event the week after triumphing at a major. To put his supremacy into context, the world ranking points gap between Scheffler (629.6) and his closest chaser Rory McIlroy (344.4) following that victory was wider than that between the Northern Irishman and world No. 784, Woods (4.64), who had then-made just five competitive appearances since the start of 2023. Despite his recent transition into fatherhood, Scheffler shrugged off any concerns of a lack of preparation ahead of his pursuit of a second consecutive major at this week\u2019s PGA Championship, having relished his time away from the fairways. \u201cSitting at home with the girl I dated in high school with our child and then the green jacket sitting in the closet is a pretty insane feeling, and I just wanted to be as thankful as possible,\u201d he said ahead of the tournament. A level of disruption was always on the cards at Valhalla, with caddie, Scott, scheduled to leave Louisville to attend his daughter\u2019s high school graduation during Saturday\u2019s third round. And as the overwhelming tournament favorite, few would be surprised to see Scheffler at the center of attention in Valhalla. Nobody though, could have foreseen the developments that put him there.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/sport/scottie-scheffler-profile-pga-championship-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "sports"}}

The 22-time grand slam singles champion is looking to rediscover his form after a spate of injury problems have hampered his progress so far this year. Before the tournament, Nadal said that he was determined to play in Madrid \u2013 where he is a record five-time champion \u2013 one final time, despite doubts about whether he was physically ready to compete at a high level. However, he won his first three matches before losing to Lehe\u010dka in the fourth round, showing no obvious signs that his body was holding him back. \u201cToday is an emotional day, of course, today is an unforgettable day in terms of saying goodbye to Madrid,\u201d Nadal told reporters. \u201cBut it\u2019s one of the places \u2013 or even probably the place \u2013 where I\u2019ve received more love and support during all these years. \u201cMy career keeps going and I have my personal goals for the next couple of weeks.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s match saw a close opening set until Lehe\u010dka broke Nadal to love at 5-5 and then breezed through his own service game to take the first set, silencing the home crowd. The world No. 31 claimed another break in the opening game of the second set and, though Nadal battled hard to stay in touch, was able to see out the victory from there in just over two hours. Lehe\u010dka will now face Russian third seed Daniil Medvedev in the quarterfinals on Thursday. The tournament paid tribute to Nadal\u2019s five titles at the Madrid Open after the match, unfurling banners with photos of his victories in 2005, 2010, 2013, 2014 and 2017. While his family members shed tears in the players\u2019 box, Nadal thanked fans for their support, which he said would \u201cstay with me forever.\u201d The Spaniard later told reporters that he now plans to play at the Italian Open in Rome as he continues to target more grand slam success at the French Open, which begins on May 26. \u201cIt has been a very positive week, winning three matches, playing four matches at a high level of tennis,\u201d said Nadal. \u201cI enjoy it a lot playing at home and I leave here with a very positive energy in all ways.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/01/sport/rafael-nadal-madrid-open-jiri-lehecka-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "sports"}}

City now jumps two points ahead of Arsenal at the top of the table, meaning a win in its final game of the season against West Ham would secure the unprecedented feat. It was Erling Haaland who once again made the difference, with the striker scoring two second-half goals during a cagey game in north London. Despite the emotional celebrations from both the players and fans after each of the goals, City manager Pep Guardiola said his team knows the job isn\u2019t done yet. \u201cI like that they were so happy in the locker room but they know it\u2019s not done,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI didn\u2019t see an extra celebration. They know perfectly it will be tough. \u201cAll we have to do is win that game. To have the chance to live that possibility we are so fortunate.\u201d There was a strange context surrounding the game before kickoff. Tottenham knew a good result against City would hand fierce rival Arsenal an advantage in the title race, with some fans suggesting the team should try to lose the match. But Spurs manager Ange Postecoglou seemed irked by such claims and his team showed no signs of letting up on Tuesday night, coming close to snatching a draw. Unlikely hero While Haaland will take the plaudits for scoring twice \u2013 his first a simple tap-in after 51 minutes \u2013 City\u2019s goalkeeper Stefan Ortega was the unlikely hero. The 31-year-old replaced first-choice keeper Ederson in the second half after the Brazilian suffered a nasty blow to the face and it was a 21-minute cameo to remember. Ortega first produced a strong front-post save from Dejan Kulusevski after the midfielder had bundled his way through on goal, but then came the potentially title-winning moment. A rare mistake from Manuel Akanji saw Tottenham\u2019s Son Heung-Min run clean through on goal in the 86th minute. The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium held its breath, expecting the back of the net to bulge given that the South Korean is usually so clinical. But, just as it looked as though City\u2019s title hopes were about to be handed a major blow, Ortega stuck out a strong right leg to block the striker\u2019s shot. City manager Guardiola fell to the floor out of sheer relief, while his players celebrated with the goalkeeper. Moments later, J\u00e9r\u00e9my Doku was fouled in the box and Haaland smashed home the resulting penalty in the 91st minute to rubber-stamp a vital win for City. \u201cHe [Ortega] defined how the team is a team \u2026 The margins are so, so tight,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cDo you know how many times Son punished us in the last seven or eight years? \u201cI said: \u2018No, not again.\u2019 But Stefan made an incredible save. He has this talent. In one-on-ones, he is one of the best keepers I\u2019ve ever seen in my life.\u201d City will play West Ham at home on Sunday, knowing that a win will ensure the title once again stays at the Etihad Stadium. However, if Arsenal drops points at home against Everton in its last game, City will win the league regardless of its result.

He is still struggling with the injuries that have derailed his comeback after undergoing hip surgery last season. He said last May that 2024 will likely be his last year on tour, and so the upcoming French Open represents possibly his last chance to play at a tournament with which he will forever be associated, and which he dominated during his heyday.

Nadal told reporters on Saturday that there were two ways for him to approach this year\u2019s French Open. \u201cProbably one is to say, \u2018Okay, I am not ready, I am not playing well enough.\u2019 Then is the moment to take a decision in terms of not playing Roland Garros. Another is to accept how I am today and work the proper way to try to be in a different way in two weeks,\u201d he said, according to the ATP. \u201cPhysically I have some issues, but not probably yet enough to say not playing in the most important event of my tennis career. \u201cLet\u2019s see what\u2019s going on, how I feel myself mentally tomorrow, after tomorrow, and in one week.

{"id": "2024_05_03_sport_tiger-woods-us-open-special-exemption-spt-intl", "text": "Tiger Woods will tee up at the US Open for the 23rd time after accepting a special exemption to play the 124th edition of the major on Thursday. The 48-year-old did not meet the criteria to automatically make the 156-player field set to compete at Pinehurst Resort and Country Club in North Carolina on June 16, but will fight for his fourth US Open title after the United States Golf Association (USGA) \u2013 tournament organizers of the major \u2013 granted him a spot. \u201cThe US Open, our national championship, is a truly special event for our game and one that has helped define my career,\u201d Woods told the USGA. \u201cI\u2019m honored to receive this exemption and could not be more excited for the opportunity to compete in this year\u2019s US Open, especially at Pinehurst, a venue that means so much to the game.\u201d Woods has enjoyed a storied career at the tournament. The 15-time major champion clinched his first US Open crown in historically dominant fashion in 2000, finishing 15 shots clear of his closest chaser at Pebble Beach, before adding two more wins in 2002 and 2008, the latter of which he achieved despite a leg fracture and torn ligaments. Yet Woods did not compete at last year\u2019s tournament in Los Angeles as he continued his recovery from ankle surgery, an all too familiar tale in recent years given the long-term physical impacts of his 2021 car crash. Sporadic playing appearances have seen his world ranking plummet to world No. 789, well short of the top-60 position that would stamp a ticket to Pinehurst, but Woods\u2019 legacy at the major means his invitation for a third appearance at the venue was an \u201ceasy decision\u201d for organizers. \u201cThe story of the US Open could not be written without Tiger Woods,\u201d USGA Chief Championships Officer John Bodenhamer said in a statement. \u201cFrom his 15-stroke victory at Pebble Beach in 2000 to his inspiring win on a broken leg at Torrey Pines in 2008, this championship is simply better when Tiger is in the field, and his accomplishments in the game undoubtedly made this an easy decision for our special exemption committee.\u201d \u2018My goal is to ruin the logo\u2019 Woods will be hoping to build on a history-making outing at The Masters last month, when \u2013 in just his third competitive start in a year \u2013 he made the cut at Augusta National for an unprecedented 24th consecutive time. A tough weekend saw him finish 60th, 27 shots behind champion Scottie Scheffler, but Woods remains insistent that he can still close the gap on Jack Nicklaus\u2019 record of 18 major championships. Discussing his new sportswear brand \u201cSun Day Red\u201d on NBC\u2019s Today Show on Wednesday, Woods said it was his mission to \u201cruin\u201d his line\u2019s own logo, which sees 15 stripes \u2013 one for each major \u2013 form the shape of a Tiger. \u201cMy goal is to ruin the logo, I want to keep ruining the logo,\u201d Woods told Carson Daly. \u201cIf the trademark is this, my job is to ruin it.\u201d Woods\u2019 15-year-old son Charlie was one of 10,052 that attempted to qualify for this year\u2019s US Open, but fell short after shooting nine-over 81 at a local qualifying event in Florida. The top-five finishers there have advanced to the second and final qualifying stage \u2013 dubbed \u2018Golf\u2019s Longest Day\u2019 \u2013 held at 36-hole events across 10 US and three international venues in May and June. Those that progress will join the field at Pinehurst aiming to stop reigning champion Wyndham Clark, who finished a single stroke ahead of Rory McIlroy last year to clinch his first major title.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/03/sport/tiger-woods-us-open-special-exemption-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_03_sport_sports-betting-usa-impact-on-lives-spt-intl", "text": "In August 2019, Saul Malek realized he\u2019d hit rock bottom. His girlfriend had broken up with him, friendships had gone south, and he had money problems. \u201cI noticed all my memories were really gambling related,\u201d Malek explains to CNN Sport. \u201cIf I went out with my girlfriend and some friends, I\u2019d tell her at the end of the night, \u2018This is a great night because this bet\u00a0won,\u00a0and I was up this amount.\u2019\u201d In a last-ditch effort to resurrect his relationship with his girlfriend, Malek\u00a0says he\u00a0told his Gamblers Anonymous mentor that he wouldn\u2019t place a bet for six months. Almost five years later, Malek\u00a0still\u00a0hasn\u2019t bet. \u2018This is easy\u2019 The billions of dollars that were bet on this year\u2019s Super Bowl, the millions that will be wagered on Saturday\u2019s Kentucky Derby and stories like Malek\u2019s\u00a0have\u00a0brought into sharp focus the US\u2019 complicated relationship with sports gambling. It was in his college sophomore year that Malek\u00a0says he\u00a0was introduced to an illegal bookkeeper. \u201cIt was definitely murky in terms of the legality and legitimacy of all of it, but I didn\u2019t really care,\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cI enjoyed betting with the bookies because I liked knowing that I was winning against a real person, that you know I was better than them.\u201d Malek vividly remembers his first $10 win. \u201cIt was a total warping of my mind,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Malek. \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing. This is easy, this is great.\u201d However, $10 bets became $100 wagers, which quickly morphed into stakes involving\u00a0thousands of dollars. \u201cWhen I really started losing and chasing the losses, I had an awareness that it was uncomfortable,\u201d admitted Malek. \u201cBut I think I was in such a mode of trying to solve everything that I didn\u2019t see it as really much of a problem.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until his parents noticed \u201csketchy people messaging him,\u201d and his school grades becoming an issue that Malek, who is now a public speaker on gambling awareness, knew he was in too deep. A \u2018massive explosion\u2019 It was in 2018 that the US Supreme Court struck down a 1992 federal law,\u00a0which had prohibited most states from allowing sports betting. Fast forward to 2024 and the gambling industry is engrained in US sports culture with leagues, franchises, players and networks now partnering with betting organizations. Nevada was the lone state able to provide sports betting in 2018, but it\u2019s now legal in 38 states and\u00a0the District of Columbia, with active legislation surrounding sports\u00a0betting\u00a0in a further six states. In February, when the Super Bowl was staged,\u00a0Americans bet $10.49 billion on sports, a 24.8% year-over-year increase,\u00a0according to the American Gaming Association\u2019s (AGA) gaming revenue tracker. Ahead of the Super Bowl, the AGA was predicting a record 67.8 million American adults (26%) would bet\u00a0an estimated $23.1 billion\u00a0on the event, a 35% increase from 2023. And, overall, nearly $120 billion in legal bets were made last year. \u201cIn America, as long as there have been sports to bet on, people have been betting on sports,\u201d AGA senior vice president Joe Maloney told CNN Sport in an interview. \u201cDemocrats and Republicans, if there\u2019s one thing that they could agree on, illegal betting was already happening.\u201d Maloney says the 2018 decision was an opportunity to bring betters into the legal marketplace\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and for politicians to\u00a0capture tax revenue. In 2023, more than $11 billion in state taxes were brought into state coffers. According to the US Census, New York state is by far the leader in taxes collected. \u201cThere was this rush by state government, quite frankly, to capitalize on gambling revenue and the gambling industry was happy to play along,\u201d Keith Whyte,\u00a0executive\u00a0director of the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG),\u00a0told\u00a0CNN Sport. The legal market It\u2019s estimated that 2.5 million adults in the US \u201cmeet the criteria for a severe gambling problem in a given year,\u201d according to the NCPG. Maloney maintains that one of the advantages of legalized sports gambling is the measures that are put in place to help those who suffer with gambling addictions. \u201cThe illegal market has flourished for probably four to five decades in this country \u2026 and there was never any problem gambling resources at any serious level to support those that are demonstrating problematic behavior,\u201d Maloney says. \u201cWe\u2019re really proud of the fact that \u2026 there\u2019s more money being devoted to problem gambling in this country than there ever has been.\u201d Whyte\u00a0says he\u00a0is less convinced. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen no evidence of that whatsoever,\u201d says Whyte when asked about legalized sports gambling helping curb gambling addiction. \u201cWe think the risk has gone up by about 30%.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m in the District of Columbia right now. The mayor recently cut every single penny of public funding to prevent and treat gambling problems. So right where the AGA and the National Council for Problem Gambling is located \u2013 the nation\u2019s capital \u2013 they abolished all public funds for problem gambling,\u201d adds Whyte. \u2018The pace of innovation\u2019 From LeBron James\u2019 NFL partnership with DraftKings to ESPN launching an official sportsbook, it is becoming increasingly hard to watch sport without gambling being part of the viewing experience. A 2023 NCAA study\u00a0surveyed young adults aged 18-22.\u00a0\u00a0It says that among those who had seen sports gambling advertisements, 52.8% said it made them more likely to want to gamble. Among higher risk gamblers as many as 80% say the ads they have seen make them more likely to gamble. Whyte says that these ads aren\u2019t too much of a concern if you\u2019re not in the higher risk groups but the connection among those who are is concerning. Maloney counters that advertising is crucial in taking gamblers from illegal to legal markets. \u201cAdvertising is very important upon markets being opened legally and regulated to communicate to betters that there is this opportunity to now bet in the legal market,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Maloney. The rise of advertisements and promotions is something that concerns NBA commissioner Adam Silver. \u201cI live in the New York market. It\u2019s constant in terms of promotions for people to bet on sports,\u201d said Silver recently. \u201cI worry also about young people. It\u2019s, of course, illegal for young people to bet on sports,\u201d added the commissioner. Ramon Zelaya, the moderator of Reddit\u2019s problem gambling forum, concurs. \u201cThe explosion of sports betting has captured the attention and engagement of younger gamblers. Folks starting in their teens,\u201d Zelaya told the NCPG. \u201cI\u2019ve had 16-year-olds post on the subreddit. I have noticed that the college age demographic tends to gravitate towards sports betting, online poker, trading cryptocurrency, that sort of thing.\u201d Despite Silver\u2019s hand-wringing over the proliferation of sports betting ads, the NBA in March said it had joined up with Sportradar to provide NBA League Pass users with the chance to look at live odds throughout games. \u201cWhere sports betting is legal, users can opt-in to have the convenience of viewing and selecting bets directly on NBA League Pass. When ready to place a bet, they are directed to FanDuel or DraftKings, the NBA\u2019s official betting partners, through a seamlessly embedded link,\u201d the Sportradar statement read. Malek believes that this lack of friction is dangerous. \u201cHaving it right there, really made it just so convenient that I was able to just click a button,\u201d he expained. Maloney, however, points to the opportunities technological innovation offers the betting industry and its customers. \u201cI think the pace of innovation right now, particularly as it relates to fan engagement and betting, and in play betting and live betting will continue to increase,\u201d said Maloney. \u201cI believe that the embrace with leagues, teams and industry partners will continue,\u201d he added. Whyte\u2019s concern is that most sports bettors \u201cwhen they get deep into in play [betting]\u201d have no idea of the true odds and that it\u2019s nigh impossible to calculate the true odds within the required 30 seconds you need to place an in-play bet. The betting industry also points to its continued emphasis on \u201cresponsible gambling,\u201d saying three quarters of what it describes as \u201ctraditional Super Bowl bettors\u201d report seeing a responsible gambling message in the last year, up from 71% in 2023. Sporting integrity Recently the NBA banned Toronto Raptors player Jontay Porter from the league after an investigation found that the 24-year-old had violated betting rules, the league said. The NBA said its investigation found that Porter had \u201cviolated league rules by disclosing confidential information to sports bettors, limiting his own participation in one or more games for betting purposes, and betting on NBA games.\u201d With the rise of sports gambling, this could become more common and it\u2019s something that NBA commissioner Silver is concerned by. \u201cIt\u2019s a cardinal sin, what he\u2019s accused of, in the NBA, and the ultimate extreme option I have is to ban him from the game,\u201d said Silver. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more serious, I think, around this league when it comes to gambling and betting on our games, and that is a direct player involvement,\u201d added Silver. Porter didn\u2019t respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment when his ban was announced. In late March, the NBA said it was \u201clooking into\u201d anomalies involving prop bets pertaining to Porter. Reportedly there were two specific games in which DraftKings Sportsbook flagged prop bets involving Porter in its daily betting insights. A DraftKings spokesperson told CNN after Porter was banned: \u201cWe have no comment on this story.\u00a0In general, it is important to note that one of the many benefits of legal and regulated sports betting is that sports betting operators identify and report suspicious activity and the integrity of sport is therefore protected in a manner that does not exist in the illegal market.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/03/sport/sports-betting-usa-impact-on-lives-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "sports"}}

The agreement will see each side contribute $625 million to the project, which will see the Jaguars current home - EverBank Stadium \u2013 undergo wholesale renovations, per the city. The city will then spend another $150 million to get the stadium ready for construction in 2026. The proposal, announced last year, still has to go through two key stages before it is officially given the go-ahead. Firstly, city council members will vote on the project in June, with a majority of 19 members needed for it to pass. If that goes through, it would then be voted on at the annual NFL owners meeting in October, where 24 of the 32 owners would need to give the proposal the green light. \u201cIt\u2019s with great pride and excitement that we present this historic deal,\u201d Jacksonville mayor Donna Deegan posted on X, formerly Twitter. \u201cIt\u2019s a crucial step in the development of a thriving downtown which generates the commercial revenue that will fund so much of what we want to do in neighborhoods across the city.\u201d \u201cJacksonville has the privilege of being an NFL town and this deal will ensure our citizens can enjoy the benefits of that privilege for decades to come.\u201d The proposal would keep the Jaguars in Jacksonville for another 30 years and would come with a non-relocation agreement. Construction would begin after the 2025 season, with the Jaguars playing in front of a reduced capacity in 2026, per the city. The team\u2019s home games would then take place away from Jacksonville the following season while the stadium is renovated. The Jaguars say that their plans \u201ccall for a reimagined stadium with an environmentally friendly and cost-effective structure that showcases state-of-the-art innovation.\u201d Among these innovations is a transparent protective canopy that provide sun, wind and rain protection and reduce heat retention by 70%, as well as a 360-degree concourse, \u201cimmersive\u201d in-bowl digital and lighting technology and a subtropical nature park open year-round to visitors. The agreement will still see the Jaguars play one game a year in London. EverBank Stadium\u2019s regular capacity of 67,814 will be reduced to around 63,000, though it can expand to 71,500 for special events such as concerts or college football games.

{"id": "2024_05_13_sport_rose-zhang-founders-cup-korda-spt-intl", "text": "Rose Zhang surged to victory at the 2024 Cognizant Founders Cup on Sunday, as Nelly Korda fell short in her final two rounds to end her historic winning streak on the LPGA Tour. Zhang, 20, birdied four of her last five holes in her final round to finish two shots ahead of Sweden\u2019s Madelene Sagstr\u00f6m \u2013 with the duo finishing way ahead of the rest of the pack \u2013 at Upper Montclair Country Club. The American began Sunday a shot behind Sagstr\u00f6m, but produced some excellent, attacking golf to move ahead, maintain her lead and claim her second LPGA Tour victory. \u201cHonestly, today has been a roller coaster. I think from the start of the day, just coming out, it was raining, it was cold. I knew it was going to be a grind,\u201d Zhang, who finished 24-under par for the tournament, said afterwards. \u201cI think coming out I had those expectations of today I really have to find it in me to even play well, let alone win. \u201cAnd Madelene has been playing rock solid golf. She\u2019s been blowing away the field so just been trying to keep up. I think that was the mindset going in. I didn\u2019t have any expectations because I knew coming out here there was going to be a lot of golf to play. \u201cA lot of mistakes could have happened, can happen, and I just have to be able to take whatever I have out here. So that was the whole day. Starting from [hole] one, hit the pin and definitely did not expect that, but it was a nice little save. And going from there was able to hit some close. Gave me a little bit of momentum just in my own round.\u201d In June last year, Zhang became the first player in 72 years to win an LPGA tournament on her professional debut. She turned pro having become the most decorated player in the history of women\u2019s amateur golf, signing off by becoming the first women\u2019s golfer to ever win back-to-back individual NCAA national titles. Ever since her breakthrough victory at the Mizuho Americas Open last year, Zhang struggled to find consistency and that winning touch again. But the young star looked back to her best during the Founders Cup, putting in a complete performance in New Jersey as she carded rounds in the 60s in all four of her rounds; this was the first time she has done so since becoming an LPGA Tour member. Her statistics over the tournament highlighted her dominance, ranking first in most birdies, the most greens hit in regulation and the player who needed the fewest number of putts. After her victory on Sunday, Zhang spoke about the increased \u201cexpectations\u201d put on her \u201cto perform\u201d after what she did in her professional debut. \u201cSometimes, the noise did get to me a little bit, but I had such a good support group around me. I had people who really stuck in and told me to take it one at a time,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy to come out here. Didn\u2019t have any expectation of having to win because I realize that it\u2019s all just noise, and I have to be able to work at it myself and try my best to put myself in positions like this. But no matter what happened this week, I would\u2019ve been very satisfied and it reignited my passion for the game once again.\u201d Sunday\u2019s result ended Korda\u2019s dramatic, historic winning run after she emerged victorious in five consecutive tournaments earlier this year and was aiming for a sixth in a row, which would have earned her the outright record, at the Founders. However, despite a strong start to the tournament, the world No. 1 faded away as it progressed, eventually finishing tied for seventh and 17 shots behind Zhang. Even though her win-streak came to an end, Korda fondly reflected on her run after her finish at the Founders. \u201cYeah, gosh, hasn\u2019t even sunk in. Probably maybe now \u2013 or maybe in like 10, 15 years \u2013 it\u2019ll sink in,\u201d the 25-year-old told reporters. \u201cHopefully, someone beats it one day. \u201cBut just to do that with all the competition out here is super, super rewarding with how much work that I\u2019ve put in. So I think to get a streak like that in any sport in general is amazing with the amount of talent that I feel like every athlete has in their sport. \u201cJust an amazing feeling and, hopefully, one day it\u2019ll sink in.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/sport/rose-zhang-founders-cup-korda-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "sports"}}

The Chilean defeated the world No. 1 and top seed 6-2 6-3 in the third round of the Italian Open on Sunday in what was the first meeting between the pair. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible. I came on court just looking around and soaking it all in, trying to process everything. I\u2019m trying to wake up right now,\u201d said Tabilo, 26, per the ATP. Djokovic, a six-time champion in Rome, was broken four times by the world No. 32 and has yet to win a title this year. His five double faults were particularly costly. \u201cI was just trying to keep my nerves in, trying to keep swinging,\u201d added Tabilo. \u201cObviously every time you feel like you are closer to the end, your arms start to get a little tighter and you start to swing shorter, so I was just trying to not think about it and take it point by point. It\u2019s crazy, I can\u2019t believe what just happened.\u201d After losing the first set, Djokovic served up two double faults in the opening game of the second set to gift his opponent a crucial advantage. It was another Djokovic double fault which gave Tabilo his fourth break of the match to secure an incredible victory.

After taking a 2-0 lead in this Western Conference semifinal, Minnesota had lost three straight to Denver going into this game as the stifling defense that served the team so well early in the series appeared to crumble. However, the NBA\u2019s best defense this season finally clicked back into gear on Thursday and Denver struggled all game to find ways to consistently break Minnesota. Timberwolves forward Jaden McDaniels said the team\u2019s coaches showed the players a highlight reel of their best defensive plays this season before the game. \u201cIt was like kind of a hype video,\u201d McDaniels said, per ESPN. \u201cIt had a good effect on us. Just showing that we\u2019re able to compete with these guys. Like, we\u2019ve done it before.\u201d The Timberwolves were led by rising superstar Anthony Edwards, who registered a game high 27 points to go with four rebounds, four assists and three steals. However, Edwards was quick to lavish praise on McDaniels \u2013 who had 21 points on 80% shooting, four rebounds, two blocks and a steal \u2013 for his performance. \u201cThis guy right here, he led us tonight,\u201d Edwards told the TNT broadcast. \u201cI told somebody before, everybody on our team is a leader, and he was the leader tonight. He stepped it up, big time.\u201d Karl-Anthony Towns registered a double-double for Minnesota with 10 points, 13 rebounds and five assists. As did Naz Reid, who had 10 points and 11 rebounds, while Rudy Gobert collected 14 rebounds to go with eight points. It was a tough night all around for Denver\u2019s offense but particularly for Jamal Murray, who scored just 10 points while shooting a miserly 22.2% from the floor. \u201cWe played terrible. I played terrible,\u201d Murray said, per Reuters. \u201cOwn it - and use that to come out in front of our home fans. We\u2019ve got to win it.\u201d Newly-crowned three-time MVP Nikola Joki\u0107 had 22 points and nine rebounds in what was the biggest defeat for an MVP in a playoff game since 1956, according to ESPN\u2019s SportsCenter. \u201cThey were better than us in every segment of the game and we need to accept it, take it and just try to be better next timem\u201d Joki\u0107 told reporters candidly after the game. \u201cWhen you lose by 45 it\u2019s not like something that happens every day so just accept it.
