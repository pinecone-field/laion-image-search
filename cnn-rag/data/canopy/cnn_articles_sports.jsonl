No cause of death has been listed. He was 30 years old. \u201cWe were devastated to learn \u2013 and are heartbroken to share \u2013 that PGA TOUR player Grayson Murray passed away this morning. I am at a loss for words,\u201d PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan said in a statement Saturday. The two-time PGA Tour winner Murray withdrew from the tournament with two holes left to play in the second round on Friday, citing an illness. Earlier this year, Murray won the Sony Open in a playoff against former PGA Championship winner Keegan Bradley and South Korea\u2019s An Byeong-hun to end a six-and-a-half winless years drought during which he admitted to struggling with mental health and physical issues. CNN has reached out to tournament organizers for more information. Hailing from Raleigh, North Carolina, Murray was regarded as one of the world\u2019s best junior players, capturing three IMG Junior World titles in 2006, \u201907, and \u201908. According to the PGA Tour, at age 16, he became the second youngest to make the cut on the Korn Ferry Tour, and at age 19, he played in the 2013 U.S. Open. He went on to win the 2017 Barbasol Championship at just 23 years old. \u201cGrayson was the absolute best. Not only was he an incredible, thoughtful and generous boss, he was an even better friend,\u201d his caddie Jay Green said in a statement, according to\u00a0Golf Channel\u2019s Brentley Romine. \u201cHe truly would do anything for anyone. He has the best family, and my heart goes out to them. We will all miss him deeply.\u201d Murray\u2019s agent Kevin Canning said in a statement to CNN, \u201cWe are saddened and heartbroken to learn about the sudden passing of Grayson Murray. Grayson has been a longtime member of the GSE family and hearing the news this morning shocked all of us.\u201d And in an X post, former Masters winner Bubba Watson said he was \u201cvery sad\u201d to learn of Grayson\u2019s death. \u201cI was just hugging you at the Masters, telling you how proud of you I am,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThankful to have known you. My deepest condolences to his family and friends during this difficult time. He will be missed.\u201d Murray was vocal about some of the struggles that dogged his golf career, including alcohol. He had spent some time in rehab, according to an interview with the PGA, and also struggled with anxiety. World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler said \u201cthe news hasn\u2019t really sunk in quite yet\u201d after his third round at the Charles Schwab Challenge on Saturday. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about his family and praying hard for all of them,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how difficult of a time this is. I got to know Grayson a bit better over the last six months or so and, yeah, really just, there\u2019s not really a way to put into words how sad and tragic it is, but I\u2019m thinking about his family.\u201d 2012 US Open winner Webb Simpson also paid tribute to Murray on Saturday, saying that the two had a \u201clong history\u201d together. \u201cI think I first met Grayson at my home club when Grayson was probably eight years old, maybe nine. He was the first winner of the Webb Simpson Challenge Junior Tournament that I\u2019ve had for 14 years,\u201d Simpson told reporters. \u201cSo, when you hear news like that over the phone you don\u2019t think it\u2019s real at first, and you know, you hear the emotion coming from our swing coach and then you realize it\u2019s real. \u201cBut I know that his mom was with him during the Wells Fargo Championship and I think they were hanging out together, and I loved those two days we got together. So I\u2019m super thankful for getting some good time with him before the bad news of today.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/sport/grayson-murray-death-pga/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_26_sport_nadal-french-open-success-becker-spt-intl", "text": "When Rafael Nadal leaves Roland Garros as a player for the last time, one of the greatest love affairs in all of sport will come to an end. Since making a winning debut at the 2005 French Open as a fresh-faced 18-year-old \u2013 beating Roger Federer in the semifinals on his 19th birthday \u2013 Nadal has lost just three times on the Parisian clay in the intervening 19 years. Nadal\u2019s win-loss record in the French capital stands at 112-3, a stunning win rate of 97.4%, though he also had to withdraw before his third-round match in 2016 due to injury. The Spaniard\u2019s name has become synonymous with the French Open; the \u2018King of Clay\u2019 statue \u2013 posed after hitting one of those famous forehands - has stood at the venue\u2019s entrance since 2021. \u201cYou win it five times, that\u2019s a lot,\u201d tennis great Boris Becker told CNN. \u201cYou win it 10 times, it\u2019s impossible. Nadal\u2019s won it 14 times. I don\u2019t know any other record in any other sport that equals that.\u201d Becker points to some of tennis\u2019 greats, himself included, that failed to win the French Open to further highlight the absurdity of Nadal\u2019s record in Paris. \u201c[Bjorn] Borg won it six times, which at the time was unheard [of], but [Pete] Sampras never won it, [Stefan] Edberg never won it, Becker never won it. So there\u2019s no shame in not winning the French Open,\u201d said the 56-year-old German. \u201cBelieve it or not, I liked playing Paris. I had a big support, they liked my style. I know I never won it, the only major I didn\u2019t win. I made the semifinals a few times, but I did as good as I could with my style,\u201d added Becker, who was renowned for his serve and volley game. Nadal\u2019s game is almost tailor-made for the clay. The heavy topspin on his groundstrokes means the ball grips the surface and bounces high towards an opponent, something that tormented Federer\u2019s backhand side over the years. Nadal\u2019s speed and agility not only allows him to reach more balls than many other players, forcing opponents to play more shots to win a point, but also gets him into position earlier and allows him to elegantly slide through the red dirt into his shots. The loose clay absorbs some ball speed, too, making shots slower and rallies longer, something Nadal\u2019s peak physical form gave him an advantage at, but will now likely be to his detriment given the injuries he\u2019s had to deal with. \u201cThe ultimate goal on clay, the mentality is to make one less mistake than the opposition, which is different to all the other surfaces,\u201d Becker explains. \u201cSo if you look for more winners than your opponent on the clay court, ultimately you\u2019re going to lose. \u201cClay is physically very demanding. You have to have a special sliding technique that\u2019s different to all the other surfaces. \u201cGood forehand topspin or backhand topspin helps but nowadays players play a lot of drop shots, a lot of kick serves and even come in [to the net] so versatility is also very important on clay.\u201d Much is said about the French Open crowd each year - some good, some bad - but it provides perhaps the most boisterous atmosphere of any tennis tournament in the world. Whether a partizan crowd chooses to either root for you as a player or cheer against you can have an impact on the outcome of a match, Becker says. Nadal, it goes without saying, is always the darling of the French Open crowd and has enjoyed vociferous support in some of his toughest matches. \u201cTo play on Philippe Chatrier in front of a Parisian crowd is very unique, very challenging,\u201d Becker says. \u201cThe court is probably the biggest clay court in tennis, you can get intimidated very quickly. \u201cThere\u2019s no other city in the world that sounds like the Parisian crowd. It\u2019s very, very unique, it\u2019s very loud. If they support you, great. If they don\u2019t support you, you don\u2019t have a chance. \u201cSo I think the crowd almost matters more in Paris than anywhere else in the world.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/26/sport/nadal-french-open-success-becker-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_sport_carissa-moore-surfing-tahiti-olympics-spt-intl", "text": "Carissa Moore remembers the first time she surfed Teahupo\u2019o, the barreling wave located off the island of Tahiti. A recent high school graduate, Moore was short on experience \u2013 without the world and Olympic titles she possesses today \u2013 but high on curiosity and adrenaline. It didn\u2019t take long, however, for Teahupo\u2019o to live up to its reputation as one of the most fearsome waves on the planet. \u201cI was so out of my league,\u201d recalls Moore, who has surfed the famous break numerous times throughout her career. \u201cI had never surfed a wave like that ever in my life and was scared out of my pants.\u201d Teahupo\u2019o seems like a postcard from French Polynesia, a picture-perfect barrel cocooning surfers as they slice neatly across its face, a mass of foamy swell collapsing behind them. But in the wave\u2019s beauty lies also its danger: anyone who surfs Teahupo\u2019o risks being swallowed up by its steep, thundering wall of water and dragged onto the shallow reef below. \u201cIt\u2019s those waves that scare you the most that end up being the best,\u201d Moore tells CNN Sport. \u201cIt\u2019s this weird thing \u2013 your body and your mind are telling you no, but then you have to tell yourself that these [waves] are good, you have to go. \u201cIt\u2019s not a natural thing. The consequences are huge. I mean, if you fall, you could get really hurt. People have had some really horrible wipeouts and injuries from that wave. You have to tell yourself, \u2018Hey, I could also get the ride of my life and the thrill of my life at the same time.\u2019\u201d Teahupo\u2019o, often referred to as \u201cThe End of the Road,\u201d will play host to this year\u2019s Olympic surfing event, as well as this week\u2019s Tahiti Pro where Moore has been granted a wild card entry as she steps up her preparation for Paris 2024. The Hawaii native is at an important juncture in her career. She announced at the start of the year that she would be stepping away from competitions, appearing only at the Tahiti Pro and the Olympics. Moore insists that she is not retiring, instead referring to this period as \u201ca shift and an evolution.\u201d That means embracing pursuits away from the water \u2013 devoting time to her foundation, releasing a book, and finalizing a film with Red Bull about her life and career. This week, though, the focus is back on surfing. Unlike her rivals, Moore may not possess the sharpness that comes from having competed at multiple events already this season, but it\u2019s hard to see the five-time world champion losing her competitive edge during her brief time away from the tour. She was also able to take a training trip to Tahiti several weeks ago, a timely reminder of Teahupo\u2019o\u2019s violence and power. \u201cThe waves are big and intense and scary \u2026 I don\u2019t really feel like you can ever get totally 100% comfortable at a wave like Teahupo\u2019o, but I believe that the more that you put yourself in uncomfortable situations, the more comfortable you will get,\u201d says Moore. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of how I\u2019ve always worked. I\u2019m a very calculated risk-taker. The more time that I get out there, the better I\u2019ll feel. And I think when that opportunity comes in a heat, I\u2019ll know that I can go.\u201d Surfing made its Olympic debut in Japan three years ago, meaning Moore is the sport\u2019s first and only female gold medalist. She will, of course, want to defend her title and begin her indefinite period away from competitions on a high. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful I even won one gold medal,\u201d says the 31-year-old. \u201cIn surfing, just to have it all come together in one event with the variables and all of that is super special. \u201cI know it\u2019s asking a lot from the universe for it to have it happen again, but I believe I\u2019m going to give it my best shot. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s this huge pressure on myself to win gold \u2026 because sometimes that kind of pressure hinders performance.\u201d Environmental concerns about the staging of the Olympics in Tahiti, almost 10,000 miles from the host city of Paris, have already threatened to overshadow the event. The shallow coral reef, which helps to generate the heaviest, thickest wave in the world, was damaged by a barge last year during the construction of a nine-ton aluminum tower \u2013 something organizers said was necessary to host the 40 people involved in judging and televising the competition. That prompted outcry from the International Surf Association, as well as other members of the surf community; for World Surf League (WSL) events in Tahiti, a wooden structure is usually erected and later removed. \u201cHearing about how it was navigated could maybe have been done with more love,\u201d says Moore. \u201cI am a huge advocate for the environment and the reefs and the oceans \u2013 that\u2019s our playground \u2013 and I know that we have to do our very best to preserve it moving forward. \u201cThere\u2019s not much we can do now, but I definitely want to find a way to impact the community in a positive way and leave something for the next generation.\u201d One idea she talks about is the possibility of securing land to create a soccer field for kids living in the village of around 1,500 people, which she says is in \u201cthe brainstorming stages\u201d right now. Inspiring the next generation is a subject close to Moore\u2019s heart. Her foundation, Moore Aloha, was formed at a time when she was struggling mentally with life on tour, lacking a sense of purpose and passion. It uses surfing as a platform to empower young girls as they \u201cnavigate the waves of mental health, wellness and womanhood.\u201d \u201cGrowing up as a young woman, I realized there weren\u2019t as many opportunities for girls, especially in the ocean,\u201d says Moore. \u201cIt started off just as surf mentorship and sharing the aloha spirit, and it still is that \u2026 getting out and doing something creative is so positive and powerful for the mind. \u201cThere has been an increase in depression and anxiety and different stresses we have, and being in the ocean, you don\u2019t catch your phone. It\u2019s that one time of the day for myself, even, that the rest of the world disappears and I\u2019m present. And I think by being present, we can really get to know ourselves.\u201d Knowing herself and what she wants from life has been central to Moore\u2019s decision to step away from surfing, an announcement which had been a year in the making. She has previously discussed the possibility of starting a family, though her future, both in and away from the ocean, remains unclear. For one of the greatest surfers of all time, the luxury lies in being able to carve her own path. \u201cI\u2019m not closing the door completely on the tour and competing, but I definitely want to give myself the space and grace to figure out what\u2019s next,\u201d says Moore. \u201cMaybe I return, maybe I just focus on Moore Aloha and free surfing and doing film projects.

{"id": "2024_05_20_sport_emma-raducanu-french-open-qualifying-spt-intl", "text": "Emma Raducanu has dropped out of this year\u2019s French Open qualifying, opting instead to focus on building her fitness. The 21-year-old\u2019s ranking was not high enough to earn direct entry to the tournament and she did not receive a wildcard, meaning she needed to go through the qualifiers. Despite initially being entered into the qualifying draw, the Briton pulled out before matches were due to start on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s important for me to keep laying on the foundations and I will use the time to do a healthy block before the grass and subsequent hard court seasons to give myself a chance to keep fit for the rest of the year,\u201d Raducanu said in a statement, per The Times tennis journalist Stuart Fraser. The French Open\u2019s main draw is set to start on May 26. As of the latest list, Raducanu is still the third alternate, meaning she could still have the chance to compete should three players drop out. CNN has reached out to Raducanu\u2019s agent for comment. Raducanu has not played a competitive match since her defeat by Maria Lourdes Carle at the Madrid Open in the first round on April 24. The straight-sets loss was another bitter blow to her confidence after such a positive start to the clay-court season, when she inspired Great Britain to victory over France in the Billie Jean King Cup. \u201cTennis-wise I have improved because I feel like I am playing the best tennis of my career and my life,\u201d Raducanu said, per BBC Sport, at the time. Since spectacularly winning the 2021 US Open as an 18-year-old, Raducanu has struggled for consistent form and fitness and has not progressed past the second round of a grand slam. She eventually underwent surgery on both wrists and one of her ankles in May 2023 and missed both the French Open and Wimbledon last year to recover. Raducanu had hoped to use this season to build back her form on court, but remains ranked 212 in the world.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/sport/emma-raducanu-french-open-qualifying-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_sport_eton-harrow-lords-cricket-spt-intl", "text": "At Lord\u2019s Cricket Ground in the quiet, well-heeled streets of northwest London, different architectural eras collide together in a mishmash of mismatching styles representing the old and the new. A grand 134-year-old pavilion, its sandy brown stone fa\u00e7ade covered in ornate embellishments, sits at one end, staring at a futuristic glass media center across the pitch which balances on white columns and peers like a giant oblong eye over the ground. And never is that collision between the old and new more evident than when Lord\u2019s, the self-styled \u201chome\u201d of cricket and one of its most prestigious grounds, hosts the annual schoolboys fixture Eton vs. Harrow. The fixture \u2013 in which two of England\u2019s most exclusive and expensive boys\u2019 private schools play one another \u2013 is older than the oldest brick at this ground, first played in 1805 before Lord\u2019s was even at its current location. But it has become increasingly controversial and somewhat emblematic of the attempts of British institutions to reconcile their pasts with the present after it was axed from Lord\u2019s schedule by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which owns the ground, in 2022. That provoked an uproar from its members and the warring factions eventually reached a compromise in which Lord\u2019s would host both the Eton vs. Harrow and Oxford vs.Cambridge fixtures for another five years, as well as the finals of the UK\u2019s school and university cricket competitions, before another consultation with members in 2027. Eton and Harrow both said in separate statements to CNN that it was a \u201chuge privilege\u201d to play at Lord\u2019s again this year and thanked the MCC. For those criticizing the fixture, it is steeped in elitism and serves only to perpetuate stereotypes that cricket is an upper-class sport, one in which public schoolboys play annually on its most hallowed ground where the England Women have never played a Test. \u201cGuaranteeing a tiny number of schoolboys the right to play at Lord\u2019s every year when millions of children are denied that right is completely unacceptable,\u201d said the Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket in its 2023 report, which examined inequalities and discrimination within the English game. However, for those attending Friday\u2019s match \u2013 mostly relatives of the schoolboys on the pitch or alumni who have attended this fixture for decades \u2013 it is an important piece of history to preserve, a cherished tradition and another victim of \u201ccancel culture.\u201d \u2018Part of the season\u2019 The Romantic poet Lord Byron played in the inaugural Eton vs. Harrow match more than two centuries ago. Afterwards, he wrote, \u201cWe were most of us very drunk and we went together to the Haymarket Theatre where we kicked up a row, as you may suppose when so many Harrovians and Etonians meet in one place.\u201d On Friday, cheers and chants began from the moment the two teams walked out onto the sun-drenched pitch. \u201cLet\u2019s go, oi, oi, oi!\u201d shouted the Etonians as they rose to their feet from the first ball, shouting, clapping, and even waving their shoes in their air, as is tradition. In another section of the stands, the Harrovians reciprocated with a standing ovation at the first boundary, before the Etonians launched into a rendition of the \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d theme song when a player called Jack Sparrow bowled his first over. \u201cThe atmosphere today has been incredible; everyone has been really friendly. I\u2019ve never known such a convivial atmosphere before,\u201d Mark McCullen, who attended Eton and whose son is now at the school, told CNN Sport. There is no qualification procedure for the fixture. Eton and Harrow play at Lord\u2019s because they have played here for 219 years, because they are schools that are held aloft on their centuries-old history and which still churn out a disproportionate number of the British establishment. Twenty of the country\u2019s 45 Prime Ministers, including two of its last five, went to Eton; another seven Prime Ministers went to Harrow. It costs \u00a349,998 ($62,620) per year to attend Eton, and \u00a350,550 ($63,310) to attend Harrow, though both offer bursaries and scholarships for a small number of students. For many spectators, this fixture is an intrinsic part of the schools\u2019 respective histories, a tradition that remains from a time when debutantes making their entrance into upper-class society had to attend it, along with Wimbledon and the Ascot Races. Times may have changed but the tradition remains, making it almost sacrosanct for those who observe it and out-of-touch for those who don\u2019t. \u201cI think it\u2019s rather disappointing that there are a lot of people at the MCC whothink this fixture should be abolished because it\u2019s elitist,\u201d Harry Wells, an OldEtonian who first came to this fixture 57 years ago and is this year supporting hisfriend\u2019s son in the Harrow squad, told CNN. \u201cI think our country is going to sell itself down the river if it abolishes everything we\u2019ve held dear over the millennia.\u201d As late as the 1960s, carriages would pull up outside the ground, depositing families there for one of the biggest events of the \u201cseason,\u201d spectators who had watched those matches recalled. The crowds are smaller now, drawing in less money for the MCC, and around 2,000 to 3,000 people were expected to attend this year. \u201cIt used to be a big social event \u2026 people in top hat and tails. It was quite part of the season as they used to say in those days,\u201d Wells added. \u201cEveryone dresses down now, we\u2019re not so formal in any form of society, though looking here, there are lots of people in jackets and ties.\u201d Despite the May sunshine, almost every man wandered around in their suits, the Eton boys wore their red striped blazers and matching hats, the Harrow boys their navy-blue blazers while women wore flowing dresses or blouses and many carried designer handbags. \u201cI don\u2019t feel a sense of exclusivity at all,\u201d one spectator told CNN, pointing to the \u00a320 ($25) ticket available for people to come and watch. \u201cThe boys work really hard to get here \u2026 You may as well get rid of history because it\u2019s traditional and backward and imperialistic and whatever,\u201d she added. \u201cWe have to learn from the past, and the successes of the past too.\u201d \u2018A turgid image of snobbery\u2019 The question of the Eton vs. Harrow match has become entangled in the wider conversations around cricket presently. The sport \u2013 long associated with the English upper classes \u2013 has been buffeted by accusations of racism, sexism and elitism in the country where it originated while it has millions of fans around the world, considered more popular than any other global sport except soccer. For actor, writer and comedian Stephen Fry, the Eton vs. Harrow match is indicative of an image that English cricket can\u2019t quite shake off, what he described as \u201ca turgid image of snobbery and elitism.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not what cricket is about,\u201d Fry, a former MCC president and longtime cricket fan, told the Times in October 2022. \u201cIt\u2019s the second most popular sport in the world and it needs people to understand what a wonderful game it is, and how it\u2019s available for everybody.\u201d In the end on Friday, Harrow coasted to victory by 91 runs, posting 321-5 before Eton could only respond with 230 all out. And there may not be too many more opportunities for Eton to retaliate. \u201cTimes change. And the world is so far removed from that world now,\u201d Mark Nicholas, the current MCC president, told the Telegraph in October. \u201cCommon sense will prevail over the next four years within this compromise\u2026 I can see it moving on from here now very naturally.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/sport/eton-harrow-lords-cricket-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}

The three-time grand slam champion was trailing by a set and two breaks when the umpire stopped play due to an impending storm. High winds had already disrupted the match, with white pollen from the nearby park blowing over and showering the players during the second set. Having already lost the first set 7-5, Murray was irked by the conditions and complained to umpire Greg \u00adAllensworth during a change of ends about the decision to keep playing. \u201cI know you guys don\u2019t play but it\u2019s good to have a little bit of a feel about what\u2019s happening,\u201d Murray said, having served two double faults to hand Hanfmann a 4-1 lead in the second set. \u201cIt\u2019s like it\u2019s snowing out here and you still want us to keep going.\u201d The game was suspended shortly after, with players retreating to the locker room as the clay courts were covered due to the impending storm. Rain continued to fall, though, and all play was later suspended for the rest of the day. Murray will look to stage a somewhat unlikely comeback when the game resumes on Tuesday, with the winner facing Novak Djokovic in the second round. It was just Murray\u2019s third match since injuring his ankle during the Miami Open in March \u2013 the 37-year-old suffered a full rupture of his anterior talofibular ligament and a near full thickness rupture of his calcaneofibular ligament.

She credits her sometimes brutal introduction to the sport as one of the reasons for her success. \u201cI was the only girl doing it day and night, day and night, day and night,\u201d Alsaif told CNN Sport. \u201cI always spar with guys, I train with guys, I\u2019m always with the guys in the gym. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy thing, so when it comes to the cage, when I get a hit from a girl, I feel like, \u2018Whoa, is this all you\u2019ve got?\u2019\u201d The 22-year-old had already made history in MMA, even before her atomweight bout against Egypt\u2019s Nada Faheem on Friday, which she won by knock out in the second round. In January, Alsaif signed a contract with the Professional Fighters League (PFL), making her the first woman from Saudi Arabia to join a global MMA promotion. It was a notable moment in a country known for its socially conservative attitudes, where sporting opportunities have historically been limited for women. The Saudi women\u2019s soccer team only played its first match two years ago, while a domestic soccer league wasn\u2019t established until 2020. Alsaif is acutely aware of her status as a trailblazer for female MMA fighters in Saudi Arabia and takes such a responsibility seriously. \u201cIt\u2019s big, to be honest, because I\u2019m going to be carrying this thing my entire life,\u201d she said, speaking to CNN before her MMA debut fight on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit heavy to carry it, but I\u2019m excited and proud to be the person to do it.\u201d Alsaif endured a difficult upbringing, orphaned at the age of 10 after both of her parents died in a short space of time. She says she battled depression during her teenage years before finding solace in martial arts, helping her to discover a sense of purpose and peace. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a normal childhood or an easy childhood because of the loss of my parents,\u201d said Alsaif. \u201cBut after God, martial arts helped me a lot \u2013 so, so, so much. It changed my life 100% for the better. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m so addicted to martial arts. I don\u2019t want to stop doing [it] because it\u2019s just the thing that makes me feel alive. I feel I\u2019m alive when I train, when I fight, in the gym \u2013 I can feel my soul alive. \u201cWhen I breathe after the rounds, when I feel sick, when I feel tired, when I feel courage, when I feel scared, those moments, every part of that, it makes me feel alive. It\u2019s something that means a lot to me.\u201d Growing up, Alsaif had always loved extreme, adrenaline-fueled sports, and her curiosity to try something new took her to a boxing gym in her local neighborhood. That piqued her interest, but she soon found that the boxing class she was attending lacked rigor and professionalism. Then, after seeing videos of Saudi MMA fighter Abdullah Al-Qahtani on social media, the pair exchanged messages and Alsaif was invited to try the sport for herself. \u201cI started looking at the guys, and they were hitting the bags with kicks and elbows and knees,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI was like, they have more weapons than I do. I only have hands [in boxing]. I felt so jealous \u2026 I love to do the things that have more power.\u201d Alsaif started to compete in Muay Thai \u2013 the stand-up, striking combat sport originating in Thailand \u2013 and went on to win titles at the World Combat Games, the Saudi Games and the International Federation of Muaythai Associations (IFMA) World Championships under the guidance of coach Feras Sadaa. Sadaa, coach of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Muay Thai national team, has been central to Alsaif\u2019s success, though his influence extends far beyond a sporting sphere. \u201cAll these years, I never felt what [having a] father means at all,\u201d said Alsaif. \u201cAnd he was a gift from God. He did everything with me. He helped me in every situation, in the gym or outside of the gym. \u201cHe was like family. He always told anyone else that Hattan is not just my student, Hattan is one of my kids \u2026 I wish to make him so happy [and] represent him in the best way I can.\u201d Friday\u2019s fight card in Riyadh, headlined by Al-Qahtani, was Alsaif\u2019s first chance to assess whether she was able to translate her Muay Thai prowess into success in an MMA cage. The event, part of the PFL\u2019s growing prominence in the region, featured fighters from across the Middle East and North Africa, less than three months since Claressa Shields and Kelsey De Santis contested the first professional female MMA bout in Saudi Arabia. Last year, SURJ Sports Investments Company, which is owned by Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF), acquired a minority stake in the PFL, part of the PFL\u2019s strategy to recruit more fighters and attract more fans in the MENA region. Alsaif never envisioned herself becoming an MMA pioneer when she took her first curious steps into a combat gym, but said that she wants to leave a legacy in the sport. Her upcoming bout is the first step towards achieving that goal and also an opportunity to reflect on all that she has overcome during her short time as an MMA fighter. She does that between rounds in the gym, wiping any tears from her eyes and reminding herself of the effort and energy she has so far devoted to her pursuit. \u201cI start looking at myself in the mirror and I\u2019d be like, \u2018You have killed yourself; you have cried; you have sacrificed everything,\u2019\u201d said Alsaif. \u201c\u2018You are really strong; you are your own role model\u2019 \u2026 It does give me a lot of motivation.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/sport/hattan-alsaif-mma-saudi-arabia-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_sport_kylian-mbappe-psg-success-or-failure-spt-intl", "text": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 arrived at Paris Saint-Germain in 2017 as a baby-faced 19-year-old, carrying the weighty tags of being the second most expensive footballer in history and \u201cwithout doubt the most promising\u201d young player in the world, as club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi described him at the time. The burden of helping the club try and secure its first ever Champions League title, though shared at times in his seven seasons in Paris with Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107, Lionel Messi and Neymar, was also placed on Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s shoulders after PSG paid Monaco a reported $214 million for his services. Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s time at PSG has been one filled with successes, both team and individual. He\u2019s won six Ligue 1 titles, three French Cups, two League Cups and a record five Player of the Year awards. The one very notable omission from his trophy cabinet, however, is the Champions League, the title the club\u2019s Qatari owners have craved the most since taking over in 2011. For all the vast sums of money lavished on some of the greatest names in world football, the closest Mbapp\u00e9 and PSG got was the final in 2020, where the team lost to Bayern Munich. \u201cThere are a lot of emotions,\u201d Mbapp\u00e9 said in his farewell video posted on social media. \u201cMany years I had the chance and the great honor to be a member of the biggest French club, one of the best in the world, which allowed me to arrive here to have my first experience in a club with a lot of pressure.\u201d Almost seven years after arriving, Mbapp\u00e9 will have one final chance to add to his silverware collection when PSG faces Lyon in the French Cup final on Saturday. Even if Mbapp\u00e9 was to lift one more trophy, can his time in Paris be considered a success if he didn\u2019t achieve the club\u2019s ultimate goal? Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s achievements come with the caveat of being earned during a period of total PSG dominance in France, an era in which winning the league title is \u201cexpected of them, year in, year out\u201d and \u201cpar for the course,\u201d French football expert Rapha\u00ebl Jucobin tells CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting one because if you look at the numbers, statistically speaking he\u2019s probably the club\u2019s best ever player,\u201d Jucobin adds. \u201cHe\u2019s their all-time top scorer, he\u2019s won the league\u2019s Player of the Year award five times in a row. \u201cHe went to PSG to lead the club to the Champions League title so in a sense he hasn\u2019t reached that goal, but I think it\u2019s a bit more nuanced than seeing it as a success or as a failure because obviously he has achieved a lot at PSG. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting is he\u2019s not necessarily captured the hearts of fans, especially in the way he\u2019s left the club. He\u2019s not necessarily been a fan favorite, but I think he\u2019s probably - or at least statistically speaking - the club\u2019s best ever player.\u201d It\u2019s precisely the manner of Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s departure that seems to have most rankled PSG fans. It is no secret that the 2018 World Cup winner will be joining Real Madrid when his contract expires, publicly courting the Spanish giant over the years. When Real submitted a $188 million bid for Mbapp\u00e9 in August 2021 \u2013 a deal that was close to being agreed \u2013 the Frenchman admitted at the time that he wanted to leave PSG. Mbapp\u00e9 eventually made a U-turn to sign a new contract with PSG, which will now expire on June 30. In total, the Independent estimated that PSG has paid Mbapp\u00e9 a total of around \u20ac600 million ($650M) in salary during his time at the club. There was also a world record $332 million bid for the forward from Saudi club Al-Hilal in July last year, but the move never materialized as Mbapp\u00e9 reportedly always had his mind set on Real, the club he grew up idolizing. Jucobin says there is \u201ca significant section of fans who are quite frustrated\u201d with the way Mbapp\u00e9 has been \u201csemi-openly been flirting with Real Madrid.\u201d However, despite not endearing himself entirely at times to supporters over the years, the PSG ultras decided they would honor Mbapp\u00e9 with a huge tifo at his final home game at the Parc des Princes after the Ligue 1 club decided it wouldn\u2019t give the 25-year-old an official farewell ceremony. PSG were surprisingly beaten 3-1 by Toulouse in that game. \u201cThe general consensus is that they are grateful for what he\u2019s done,\u201d Jucobin says. \u201cHe\u2019s unquestionably been the face of the club for the last few seasons. He\u2019s broken all kinds of scoring records and he\u2019s brought a lot of success on the pitch. \u201cHe\u2019s also a local guy, which is also taken into account, but there hasn\u2019t necessarily been a spark between him and the fans, as you might have seen with other players. Guys like [Marco] Verratti, for example. Verratti played his final game at the start of the season before he left for Qatar. \u201cThat was a very, very emotional send-off. Verratti himself was in tears. Fans were chanting his name around the Parc des Princes. You could tell there was a real connection between him and the fans. With Mbapp\u00e9, there\u2019s maybe not as much emotion.\u201d Mbapp\u00e9 alluded to this idea in his farewell video, acknowledging he isn\u2019t as expressive or emotional as other PSG players - and certainly not as much as the fans. \u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d Mbapp\u00e9 said. \u201cHard. And I never thought it would be this difficult to announce that [I\u2019m leaving], to leave my country, France, Ligue 1, a championship I have always known, but I think I needed this. \u201cA new challenge after seven years is difficult and of course there are some people I want to thank above all: these are the fans. I know I\u2019m not the most demonstrative player. \u201cI haven\u2019t always lived up to the love you all gave me for seven years but I never wanted to cheat, I have always wanted to be effective. I do not regret any moment.\u201d For Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s former teammate Thomas Meunier, there is no doubt about his ranking among club legends. \u201cHe\u2019s the\u00a0No.1,\u201d he told L\u2019Equipe earlier this month.\u00a0\u201cAnd by a long way.\u201d News outlet Ouest France described Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s departure as \u201cthe end of a soap opera\u00a0of which the ending\u00a0was\u00a0already\u00a0known.\u201d \u201cThe striker left a mark behind him, without ever managing to lead his team to the Grail, a victory in the Champions League,\u201d it added. \u201cDespite a final in 2020, \u2018Kyks\u2019 will not have won the famous \u2018big ears cup,\u2019 which has haunted the Qatari leaders since their takeover of the club in 2011. \u201cBut the 25-year-old leaves\u00a0with records\u00a0which will be very difficult to beat, with the status of top goalscorer in the history of PSG and six French championship titles. The void left by Mbapp\u00e9 will be immense despite his repeated failures in the most prestigious of the European Cups.\u201d Real Madrid may have won 14 European Cups to PSG\u2019s zero, but the pressure of playing for Los Blancos in the Champions League and being successful remains as intense as any club on the continent. Even with Neymar and Messi around him, Mbapp\u00e9 was always unequivocally the main man at PSG. At Real Madrid, which already boasts world class young talent in Vin\u00edcius Jr. and Jude Bellingham, that won\u2019t necessarily be the case. \u201cIt will be interesting to see what he can do in that kind of environment,\u201d Jucobin says. \u201cWhere he will have not just competition on the pitch, but competition off the pitch as well in terms of being the face of the club. So I think we\u2019ll probably see a different side to Mbapp\u00e9 in that sense. \u201cHe\u2019s aware of what he\u2019s getting into. He knows what he\u2019ll have to do. He\u2019s quite an adaptable player in that sense, he knows when to take a backseat. That has been the case sometimes in the French national team. \u201cHe relishes being in the limelight, relishes taking on leadership roles, but I think he\u2019s well aware that initially he\u2019ll have to sort of work his way into that role at Real Madrid. It\u2019s not going to be handed to him on a platter.\u201d Whether or not fans agree on his status among the PSG greats, Mbapp\u00e9 has unquestionably left an indelible mark on the club - even if together they fell short of the ultimate prize.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/sport/kylian-mbappe-psg-success-or-failure-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}

The lawsuit was filed in the County Superior Court in Mecklenburg, North Carolina, by Tamaria McRae, the mother of Angell Joseph. McRae and Joseph attended a fan event at the Hornets\u2019 Spectrum Center on October 7 last year, the lawsuit detailed, waiting outside the employee\u2019s entrance to the facility in the hope of getting a signature from the basketball star, who the youngster considered a \u201chero.\u201d The lawsuit alleges that Ball\u2019s car stopped at a traffic light by the entrance, when fans moved closer to the player\u2019s vehicle to catch a glimpse of him. Ball \u201clooked directly\u201d into Joseph\u2019s face while he was stood beside his car before speeding away when the light changed, according to the lawsuit. Ball is said to have \u201coperated his vehicle in grossly negligent and reckless manner in that he accelerated his vehicle forward suddenly and without warning and struck\u201d Joseph, \u201cseverely injuring him.\u201d The lawsuit says that Joseph sustained severe and painful injuries,\u201d which caused him \u201cgreat physical pain and mental anguish.\u201d It also says that some of his injuries may be of \u201cpermanent nature\u201d and he may \u201cundergo great physical pain and mental anguish for the rest of his life.\u201d McRae is said to have to spend \u201clarge sums of money for medical attention\u201d for Joseph. CNN has reached out to the Hornets and Ball\u2019s representatives for comment. Ball has not made any public statements about the incident. According to a police report filed with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department and obtained by CNN, a 12-year-old boy suffered minor injuries described as \u201cbruises/scratches\u201d on October 7, 2023.

{"id": "2022_07_25_sport_black-representation-swimming-equality-spt-intl", "text": "Omie Dale has fond memories of splashing in the sea as a child, of racing through water parks and swimming in backwaters and rivers.   \u201cThere\u2019s so much joy that can be had once you learn to swim, once you\u2019ve abandoned those fears and you can get in the water,\u201d the 25-year-old Dale, who is based in southeast London, tells CNN Sport.  Even though swimming is a joyful experience for Dale, the stark reality is that many Black communities in Britain and the US do not have safe access to swimming lessons and public pools due to historic racism and segregation \u2013 a problem that is especially alarming given that, as Dale says, it is \u201cthe only sport that can save your life.\u201d  A history of exclusion The lack of access afforded to Black communities in Britain is what motivated Dale to become a swimming teacher in September 2019.  \u201cI used to work in Kensington (in London) as a lifeguard and some of the richest people live in that borough, but also some of the poorest,\u201d she says. She saw there was a difference when private schools and independent schools would come in and all the kids were able to swim, yet hardly any children of the same age that Dale saw from state schools could swim 25 meters.  \u201cThere\u2019s a real class barrier in the sport of swimming,\u201d Dale adds.   She is a director of Swimunity, a collective offering free swimming lessons to women and children in North Kensington, West London. It was born in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster in 2017, when a residential block caught on fire, killing 72 people \u2013 and leaving many more without homes.   \u201cThere\u2019s like a lot of people who come to swim lessons \u2026 who have undergone some form of trauma, whether that be water-related trauma or trauma related to their everyday lives,\u201d Dale says.   \u201cMany people say it\u2019s like an escape from their daily lives or is, actually, the first time that they\u2019ve taken time for themselves.\u201d  While 77% of children from the most affluent families in England can swim 25 meters unaided, only 34% from the least affluent families can, according to a 2021 survey from Sport England, a non-departmental public body that fosters grassroots sports in England.  About 95% of Black adults and 80% of Black children in England do not regularly participate in swimming, according to Sport England\u2019s report, published in January 2020. Likewise, about 93% of Asian adults and 78% of Asian children, including those with Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi heritage, do not regularly participate in swimming, the same research found. This trend extends to the US, where nearly 64% of Black children have \u201clow\u201d or no ability to swim, compared with 40% of their White peers, according to 2017 data from the country\u2019s national governing body for the sport at a competitive level, USA Swimming.   The underrepresentation of Black people in the pool in the US can be traced back to the early 20th century.   Public swimming pools became popular in North America in the 1920s and 30s and were initially open to all. However, Northern politicians stipulated a \u201cWhites Only\u201d rule, referencing racist fears about Black men fraternizing with White women.   Even after legal racial segregation ended in the US in 1964, public pools continued to be hostile environments. As people of color began to use public pools, White swimmers retreated to the privacy of their own pools and private clubs, where expensive fees continue to be an economic barrier for Black families who cannot afford the cost.    Similar examples in Britain illustrate how racial and class inequalities lead to the systemic exclusion of Black people in pools. For example, more than 4.2 million people in the UK live in ethnically diverse communities where Covid-19 national lockdowns resulted in the closure or mothballing of pools, according to Swim England \u2013 England\u2019s national swimming governing body \u2013 and the Black Swimming Association (BSA), a UK-based charity that aims to encourage more African, Caribbean and Asian communities to take up swimming.  \u2018We cannot keep recovering bodies\u2019  Globally, drowning is the third leading cause of accidental injury-related death and at least 236,000 people die each year from drowning, according to 2019 data from the World Health Organization (WHO). Children are particularly affected, with drowning being one of the top five causes of death for those aged 1-14 years in 48 of 85 countries studied by the WHO.   And while natural disasters and irregular migration are notorious risk factors, so are lower socioeconomic status, lack of higher education and being a member of an ethnic minority, depending on the country, WHO research shows.  \u201cMost drowning incidents happen when people never intend to get into the water in the first place,\u201d says Dale, who was awarded Swim Teacher of the Year by Swim England in 2021.  In December 2019, three members of the same Black British family \u2013 a 53-year-old father and his two children \u2013 died in a swimming pool at a resort in Costa del Sol, Spain, Reuters reported. The father and his 16-year-old son had reportedly leapt into the water to try to save his nine-year-old daughter, who was drowning.   Danielle Obe is the co-founder and chair of the BSA. She told CNN Sport that the Costa del Sol deaths prompted her to establish the BSA in March 2020, alongside Olympic swimmer Alice Dearing, journalist Seren Jones and songwriter, rapper and producer Ed Accura.    \u201cThis was devastating because these families were actually acquainted to me and they were from my local community,\u201d Obe says. \u201c(At) that point, I called Alice and Seren, and I said, \u2018We\u2019ve been talking about doing something for our community. We\u2019ve got to do something. We\u2019ve got to do it now. We cannot keep recovering bodies.\u2019\u201d   \u201cIt\u2019s no longer just about that lack of representation,\u201d Obe adds.   \u201cIt\u2019s now about saving lives, vital water safety, education for all. Swimming is an intervention. Swimming is a life skill.\u201d  However, there is still a lack of data when it comes to drowning-related deaths by ethnicity in the UK, says Obe.  \u201cAt the moment, we don\u2019t know how much of a disparity there is between drowning and fatalities, aquatic fatalities for different communities in the UK because, up until now, drowning data isn\u2019t really captured by ethnicity, which is another point, another issue that the BSA is looking to tackle.\u201d \u2018People just don\u2019t think Black people should swim\u2019  Dearing, the first Black female swimmer to represent Britain at the Olympics when she competed at Tokyo 2020, \u201cimplores\u201d people to learn to swim.   \u201cI have been quite torn between the amazing achievement of being the first Black woman to represent GB in swimming but wanting to be my own person, my own athlete, who\u2019s known for being an athlete and not for her race and her sport combined together,\u201d she tells CNN Sport. \u201cI take the two of them just as they are \u2013 kind of like separate things. I\u2019m trying to be the best athlete and best role model that I can be to show people that they can do the sport, that the sport is for everybody.\u201d At the age of 24, Dearing was making history in Japan and became a beacon of hope for young people \u2013 especially Black girls \u2013 who wanted to break into the sport.   But her personal triumph also drew attention to the institutional access gap for people of color in swimming.    \u201cFortunately, for myself, I haven\u2019t come across any barriers at the level I\u2019m at currently,\u201d Dearing says.   \u201cBut I have faced barriers when I was younger and issues where people just don\u2019t think Black people should swim, or do swim, or think that we\u2019re better suited to other sports and so shouldn\u2019t even learn to swim or attempt swimming in the first place.\u201d  CNN reached out to the International Swimming Federation (FINA), Sport England and USA Swimming requesting a breakdown of Black and ethnic minority participation in swimming at grassroots and professional levels of the sport. However, they told CNN they were unable to provide such data.  FINA \u2013 the global governing body for swimming \u2013 told CNN it does not have a breakdown of the ethnicities of swimmers at a grassroots or elite level.   FINA said in 2021 it allocated $6.6 million towards development programs for distribution among all national federations and continental associations, while also pushing for diversity in the sport through its \u201cSwimming for All, Swimming for Life\u201d program.   \u201cFINA remains fully committed to non-discrimination,\u201d the organization said to CNN in a statement. \u201cFINA continues to work hard to ensure that the global aquatics community is a place where all athletes, coaches and administrators are treated equally. \u201cWork will continue to develop and grow with the support of members of the aquatics community as we strive to be at the forefront of this essential area,\u201d FINA added.    Sport England told CNN in a statement that it is \u201ccommitted to increasing investment in facilities and organisations across England to try to level up access to good quality sports and activities.\u201d \u201cBarriers to getting active persist and have even been exacerbated for some disadvantaged groups \u2013 like women, people with long-term health conditions, disabled people, people from ethnically diverse communities and lower socio-economic groups,\u201d the statement added.   Sport England said in May it announced further funding that brings its total investment in its 121 partners to more than \u00a3550 million ($670 million), which they\u2019ve selected \u201cdue to their unique position to tackle entrenched activity inequalities and influence positive change throughout the sector, their own networks and beyond.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s not all about the economic side of things. It is also about getting people to feel comfortable with putting their kids in swim lessons and in competitive swimming so that they can then go and do other aquatic-based sports,\u201d Joel Shinofield, the managing director of sport development at USA Swimming, told CNN during a phone call.  USA Swimming is a membership-serviced organization that has over 3,100 clubs and more than 400,000 members, according to the official website.   \u201cOur goal is to facilitate opportunities and make sure they\u2019re good ones. While our clubs are the ones that do that on the local level, the resources, guidance, support, financial investment that we provide can shift who those opportunities can be provided to and more broadly create access,\u201d he added.   Shinofield said that USA Swimming has established a 10-year initiative that will grant $1 million to develop learn-to-swim and competitive opportunities for communities served by Historical Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The program was announced in 2021, according to the USA Swimming official website.   Serving underrepresented communities  From representing their organization at the UK\u2019s first Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Summit For Sport in Birmingham, England earlier this year to facilitating swimming classes in Hackney \u2013 one of the most deprived boroughs in London \u2013 Obe hopes that the BSA will help bridge the barrier through community-level engagement.   \u201cThat community engagement really is to build trust, accountability and collaboration with disenfranchised communities and the sector,\u201d says Obe.  \u201cOnly in understanding these attitudes and understanding some of the barriers that preclude our communities from engaging in aquatics can we begin to drive change.\u201d  In August 2021, the BSA announced it would conduct a research program with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the University of Portsmouth, exploring the behaviors and barriers that prevent African, Caribbean and Asian communities from swimming.    Speaking about the program, Obe says: \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to inspire confidence with African, Caribbean and Asian communities, and the only way we\u2019re able to do that is to ensure that we understand where these communities are in the first place and understand why they don\u2019t engage in aquatics, why we don\u2019t see the representation pool side and why we don\u2019t even see the representation within some aquatic organizations.\u201d  Dale also volunteers with Mental Health Swims, a grassroots organization that facilitates swimming meet-ups for people struggling with their mental health. As part of her work for the organization, she coordinates swim events in south London to help swimmers access the mental health benefits of the sport. She also volunteers for Pride in Water, a network that aims to increase LGBTQ+ representation in swimming.   \u2018The future is bright\u2019  Dearing says that despite the racial and economic barriers to swimming for African, Caribbean and Asian communities, she\u2019s still optimistic about the changing landscape of the sport.  \u201cI really think if anything is going to change, it\u2019s going to be now, it\u2019s going to be over the next couple of years,\u201d she says. \u201cEach story is different, each person is different and has to be understood in their own way, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, that\u2019s just another challenge that we have to face and we\u2019re up for it.  \u201cIt\u2019s tough \u2013 it\u2019s not a quick fix, but the future is bright.  \u201cI like to feel that I\u2019m giving something back to swimming and, hopefully, giving something to the Black community to hopefully achieve, strive for and change the way that Black people are viewed in swimming and the way Black people view swimming.  \u201cIt\u2019s a double-edged sword; I absolutely love doing it. Sometimes, it\u2019s really frightening and daunting, but if I\u2019m trying to make the world a better place, then sometimes you got to step out and scare yourself.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/07/25/sport/black-representation-swimming-equality-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}

The Mon\u00e9gasque driver led from start to finish, crossing the finish-line over seven seconds ahead of second-placed Oscar Piastri. Ferrari\u2019s Leclerc paid an emotional tribute to his late father after the race, telling broadcaster Sky Sports that he was thinking about him as he drove towards the finish. \u201cHe has given everything for me to be here and it was a dream of ours for me to race here and win here, so it\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d he said. Leclerc also had to survive a dramatic opening lap in which a fifth of the field crashed, causing the race to be red-flagged before a lengthy delay, during which marshals cleared debris off the track and rebuilt sections of the barriers. The chaos began when Ferrari\u2019s Carlos Sainz punctured just after the start following contact with Piastri and had to use a run-off. Then, in a separate incident, Kevin Magnussen clipped Sergio P\u00e9rez while trying to overtake him and the Red Bull driver bounced along the walls, his car crumbling and shedding debris all over the track, before coming to a stop in a crumpled heap with just one tire left. Magnussen\u2019s teammate Nico Hulkenberg was also caught up in the crash from which all the drivers were able to walk away but were all forced out of the race. There was another incident in the pack too causing Alexander Albon to retire from the race after he collided with his Alpine teammate Pierre Gasly. The red flag offered a reprieve for Sainz who was able to retake his original position in third place on the grid when the race restarted after a lengthy delay to rebuild the barriers that P\u00e9rez crashed into.

{"id": "2024_05_23_sport_ncaa-settlement", "text": "The National Collegiate Athletic Association and the Power Five conferences have agreed to a settlement, paving the way to allow schools to pay student-athletes, a profound moment ushering in a new age in college sports. The NCAA, the governing body for college sports, and the leaders of the Big Ten, Southeastern, Pac-12, Atlantic Coast and Big 12 conferences\u00a0announced\u00a0the settlement Thursday night. According to multiple reports citing unnamed sources, the agreement\u00a0to settle\u00a0three antitrust cases includes the payment of more than $2.7 billion in damages to past and current student-athletes. Per ESPN, sources said the parties have agreed to a revenue-sharing plan which will allow each school to share up to \u201croughly $20 million per year with its athletes.\u201d All Division I athletes who have played since 2016 are eligible to receive a share. In exchange, any athletes who receive\u00a0a share cannot sue the NCAA for other potential antitrust violations and drop their complaints in the three antitrust cases \u2013 House v. NCAA, Hubbard v. NCAA and Carter v. NCAA,\u00a0according to ESPN. Reports added Judge Claudia Wilken, who is presiding over the three antitrust cases, must\u00a0still\u00a0approve the settlement terms, which could take several months and once approved, schools can begin revenue sharing in the fall of 2025. The settlement, if accepted by Wilken, represents a turning point in college athletics, which have traditionally competed under the guise of amateurism, allowing a seedy underbelly of hidden payments and compensation to flourish. Numerous college programs have been punished by the NCAA for their players being compensated in some way for their exploits on the field, from thousands of dollars being paid to star players under the table to a coach buying a recruit a hamburger on a visit. As the business of college sports took off, the veil of amateurism had begun to seem absurd to many observers: Schools and conferences began raking in millions upon millions of dollars, coaches were preaching austerity and amateurism before leaving their players to take a new job with a massive pay raise and TV networks helped reshape the landscape of the sport to maximize their own profits. At the same time, the players on the field were being paid nothing, even though they were the ones playing in the games dring what had become a multibillion-dollar industry. The House vs. NCAA lawsuit sought to change it. Filed by Grant House and Sedona Prince, two college athletes, against the NCAA and the Power Five conferences \u2013 the Pac-12, Big Ten, Big 12, Southeastern and Atlantic Coast \u2013 the lawsuit focused on the eight-year, $8.8 billion extension the NCAA signed to broadcast coverage of the March Madness basketball tournament, as well as seeking backdated damages for payments the suit calls wrongly withheld. While an NCAA rule change allowed for players to be paid for the use of their name, image and likeness, often through sponsorships and advertisements, the suit argued the NCAA restricts how much student athletes can earn outside employment. For example, the suit says one NCAA bylaw, regulating jobs athletes can hold at their universities,\u00a0\u201cspecifically prohibits athletes from receiving any remuneration for value or utility that the student-athlete may have for the (outside) employer because of the publicity, reputation, fame or personal following that he or she has obtained because of athletics ability.\u201d Ohio State University Athletics shared a message from NCAA president Charlie Baker on its website Friday providing details on the settlement agreement. The message was sent to all Division I member schools, the NCAA told CNN. \u201cWe have managed to negotiate the total back damages for these cases down to nearly $2.78 billion, to be paid over 10 years, equating to approximately $280 million annually,\u201d Baker\u2019s statement reads. \u201cTo address this obligation, we have developed a plan where the NCAA will contribute $1.2 billion over 10 years, representing 42% of the total back damages. The remaining 58% will be distributed among the Division I conferences based on their distributions over the past nine years,\u201d the statement from Baker continues. \u201cThis translates to an annual contribution of $165 million, or a 20% total reduction in distributions.\u201d In a joint statement, the leaders of the five conferences and the NCAA said they hoped the settlement could be an important moment in the reform of the college sports world. \u201cThis settlement is also a road map for college sports leaders and Congress to ensure this uniquely American institution can continue to provide unmatched opportunity for millions of students. All of Division I made today\u2019s progress possible, and we all have work to do to implement the terms of the agreement as the legal process continues. We look forward to working with our various student-athlete leadership groups to write the next chapter of college sports,\u201d read the statement, which was attributed to Baker, ACC Commissioner Jim Phillips, Big Ten Commissioner Tony Petitti, Big 12 Commissioner Brett Yormark, Pac-12 Commissioner Teresa Gould and SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey. While it\u2019s unclear what immediate effect the settlement will have on college sports, it\u2019s been clear for some time a reckoning was coming \u2014 particularly in the wake of the rule change around NIL compensation in 2021. The rule change, combined with a softening of the transfer rules, have led to players bouncing from school to school in search of a better NIL deal when in the past they would be forced to stay at their original school for their four years of eligibility or risk sitting out a year following a transfer. Athletes\u2019 increased use of the transfer portal, the commissioners said, has become problematic in college sports, particularly for student-athletes\u2019 quest to get a degree. They said college boosters have taken advantage of the current patchwork of laws to help their universities recruit the top athletes by promising big paydays \u2014 to the detriment of colleges in other states forced to play by a different set of rules. The lack of regulation around NIL has made for a sort of Wild West atmosphere in college sports the NCAA will now hope to curtail in some way. The reported revenue-sharing plan could help smaller schools that may not have rich NIL collectives stay on a more level playing field with the big-name schools that do.

But United scored two first-half goals in quick succession \u2013 the first from Alejandro Garnacho, the second from Kobbie Mainoo \u2013 to rattle the Premier League champion and make this the first men\u2019s FA Cup final, according to statisticians Opta, with two teenage goalscorers. City continued to press in the second half, creating several opportunities that only brilliant goalkeeping from Andr\u00e9 Onana or the woodwork could keep out, before Jeremy Doku scored in the 87th minute, halving United\u2019s lead and setting up a frantic seven minutes of stoppage time. But United clung on to its hard-fought lead and its bench emptied onto the pitch after the final whistle to celebrate winning a trophy after an often miserable season for the historic club. Their celebrations continued as Prince William, the President of the Football Association, handed them the trophy with Prince George alongside him, watching on. \u201cIt was the last chance to get something positive from the season,\u201d captain Bruno Fernandes told the BBC afterwards. \u201cWe were here last season and we weren\u2019t good enough and we had to see them go up and get the trophy.\u201d \u201cIt is crucial for everyone. We know the manager is under so much scrutiny, he deserves this, also everyone in the backroom staff and the players, we all deserve this.\u201d A manager under pressure Rumors and reports swirled before kickoff about the fate of United manager Erik ten Hag and whether he would lose his job regardless of the FA Cup final result. After two years in the job, and a promising start, the Dutchman has so far failed to turn around United\u2019s dwindling fortunes and led the club to an eighth place finish in the Premier League this season, its lowest ever. Such a backdrop to the final echoed the one in 2016, when one of Ten Hag\u2019s predecessors, Louis van Gaal, was sacked just after he won the FA Cup final. It has been eight years since then, 11 since legendary manager Alex Ferguson retired, and still United has not rediscovered the winning formula that made it the Premier League\u2019s most dominant club in the 1990s and 2000s. Instead, it has become mired in a seemingly endless cycle of hiring and firing managers once every couple of years, a cycle that Ten Hag looks to be in danger of repeating, even after this extraordinary shock result. He cut a tense figure on the touchline, watching City dominate possession in the early exchanges, employing its usual method of wearing the opposition down through sheer force, but, this time, it could not break down the United defense. Instead, it was United who took the early lead, capitalizing on a rare City mistake when a miscommunication between Josko Gvardiol and Stefan Ortega caused Gvardiol to head the ball over his goalkeeper, leaving Garnacho a clear path to tap the ball into the net. Seven minutes later, United thought it had doubled its lead through Marcus Rashford though he was offside and the goal was disallowed, but that was no matter. It took just two more minutes for United to find the back of the net once again. Rashford floated the ball downfield from just beyond the halfway line and found Garnacho on the other wing who passed inside to Fernandes in the center of the box.The United captain delicately tapped the ball to Mainoo who made no mistake with the finish to give his side a 2-0 lead at halftime. City seemed stunned and never quite settled into its usual rhythm. Erling Haaland had an opportunity but struck the woodwork and Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez pulled a shot wide of the goal before Doku scored. But it was too little too late and City succumbed to a rare defeat, bringing the curtain down on another dominant, historic season, though this one finished with one trophy, instead of the three it won last year.

The three-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback Mahomes told reporters that Butker is a \u201cgood person\u201d despite \u201cnot necessarily agreeing\u201d with his comments, which were made in an address to graduates at Benedictine College, a small Catholic school in Atchison, Kansas. \u201cI\u2019ve known him for seven years,\u201d the two-time NFL MVP said after the team\u2019s organized team activities (OTA\u2019s). \u201cI judge him by the character that he shows every single day \u2026 that\u2019s someone who cares about the people around him, cares about his family and wants to make a good impact in society.\u201d Mahomes said that in a locker room, he encounters people from different backgrounds, with different views. \u201cWe\u2019re not always going to agree, there are certain things that he said that I don\u2019t necessarily agree with but I understand the person that he is and he\u2019s trying to do whatever he can to lead people in the right direction,\u201d he said. Big names distance themselves from speech In his speech, Butker bemoaned diversity and equity initiatives to about 485 male and female graduates, as well as suggesting that women find more fulfillment through getting married and having children than by pursuing careers \u2013 directly after quoting a song by Taylor Swift. Mahomes, 28, reiterated that he didn\u2019t \u201cnecessarily agree\u201d with what was said when asked what part of Butker\u2019s speech he disagreed with. \u201cI\u2019m not going to judge him by that, I judge him by the way he acts every single day. I\u2019m not going to get into the full details of the entire speech,\u201d Mahomes added. \u201cAt the same time, I know what type of person he is and I\u2019m going to make sure I look at that first and let the other stuff handle itself.\u201d Chiefs head coach Andy Reid said he talks to Butker \u201call the time\u201d but did not address the speech with him. \u201cWe\u2019re a microcosm of life here,\u201d Reid said. \u201cEverybody is from different areas, different religions, different races and we all get along. We all respect each other\u2019s opinions, and not necessarily do we go by those but we respect everybody to have a voice. Reid added that he didn\u2019t think \u201che was speaking ill to women. He has his opinions, and we all respect that.\u201d After the conclusion of the National Football League\u2019s (NFL) Spring League Meeting in Nashville, league commissioner Roger Goodell was asked about Butker\u2019s comments at his usual post-meeting press conference Wednesday. \u201cWe have over 3,000 players. We have executives around the league.\u00a0 They have diversity of opinions and thoughts just like America does,\u201d Goodell said \u201cI think that\u2019s something that we treasure and that\u2019s part of, I think, ultimately what makes us as a society better.\u201d The NFL had previously distanced itself from the speech, saying Butker\u2019s comments don\u2019t reflect the views of the league. \u201cHarrison Butker gave a speech in his personal capacity. His views are not those of the NFL as an organization,\u201d said senior vice president Jonathan Beane, the league\u2019s chief diversity and inclusion officer. \u201cThe NFL is steadfast in our commitment to inclusion, which only makes our league stronger.\u201d The 28-year-old Butker, who is entering his eighth season in the league, did not address the media on Wednesday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/sport/patrick-mahomes-defends-harrison-butker-after-speech-intl-spt/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_26_sport_manchester-united-erik-ten-hag-future-spt-intl", "text": "After winning a major trophy, and particularly after stunning an overwhelming favorite in the final, teams normally enjoy a period basking in that achievement and soaking in the glory. But Manchester United\u2019s celebrations after defying the odds to defeat Manchester City and win the English FA Cup on Sunday were tempered by reports that its manager Erik ten Hag would be fired, regardless of the result. When those reports were put to him after Sunday\u2019s victory, Ten Hag pointed to his trophy-winning r\u00e9sum\u00e9. \u201cIf they don\u2019t want me anymore, then I\u2019ll go anywhere else to win trophies because that is what I have done my whole career,\u201d he told reporters after the game. \u201cThe team is progressing, and we are winning trophies. Two trophies in two years is not bad,\u201d he said, referring to his team\u2019s League Cup victory last year. \u201cThree finals is not bad but we have to keep going. I\u2019m not satisfied with it.\u201d CNN has contacted Manchester United for comment about the reports that Ten Hag\u2019s future with the club is in doubt. The Dutchman has been at the club for almost two years and, despite a promising start to his tenure, presided over United\u2019s worst ever Premier League season this year as it only mustered an eighth place finish, outside qualification for European football. In the league, United\u2019s erratic performances culminated in a 4-0 loss to Crystal Palace earlier this month, which further heaped pressure on a beleaguered Ten Hag and heightened the sense of crisis around the club. Ten Hag has pointed to an injury crisis as explaining some of United\u2019s inconsistency but new investment from British petrochemical billionaire Jim Ratcliffe has increased the clamor for improvement. Before the FA Cup final on Saturday, that pessimism manifested in a sense of inevitability that United would lose, as it did last year, to an all-conquering City which had just won the Premier League. But United\u2019s teenage stars \u2013 Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo \u2013 scored in quick succession in the first half to propel the club to a 2-1 victory over City. \u201cI\u2019m in a project and we are exactly where we want to be,\u201d Ten Hag said afterwards. \u201cWe are constructing a team and when I took over, it was a mess at Man Utd. We are now on our way to constructing a team for the future. \u201cThere is still a lot of work to do but we are exactly where we are,\u201d he added afterwards. \u201cWe have value in the squad, and we have (players) with high potential who are progressing very well.\u201d One trophy-winning performance, however, may not be enough to save Ten Hag. There is precedent for United sacking a manager immediately after winning the FA Cup as the club did to Louis van Gaal in 2016, and Ten Hag still hasn\u2019t brought a sense of stability or success to United which was so dominant for so long during the 1990s and 2000s.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/26/sport/manchester-united-erik-ten-hag-future-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_sport_pep-guardiola-future-man-city-premier-league-spt-intl", "text": "In the last 15 years, there has been no manager more influential than Pep Guardiola. First he moulded the great Barcelona team of the late noughties and early 2010s, a side spearheaded by Lionel Messi and which played the \u2018tiki-taka\u2019 style now familiar around the world. He had a similar effect at Bayern Munich, winning three titles in his three seasons with the German giant. Latterly, Guardiola has cast his spell over the English Premier League \u2013 an institution famed for its unpredictably. His Manchester City teams have dominated the league with six titles in seven seasons, claiming a fourth in a row on Sunday. City is the first team to win four consecutive Premier League titles and such a feat vaults this iteration into the pantheon of greatest soccer teams ever. However, Guardiola suggested after his team\u2019s title victory that it could be part of his closing act in Manchester. \u201cThe reality is I\u2019m closer to leaving than to staying,\u201d Guardiola told Sky Sports. \u201cIt\u2019s eight years, will be nine. Right now my feeling is I want to stay next season. In elite football management it\u2019s rare for a manager to stay in charge of a team for so long given the pressures of the job. \u201cWe talked with the club, we have time to talk next season because I have to see the players as well, if they follow me, they follow us. I want to stay next season,\u201d added Guardiola. \u2018Second to none\u2019 Historically these last 15 years have been extraordinary for Manchester City fans. Often associated with living in the shadow of its crosstown rival United, consistently challenging for league titles has been very much out of City\u2019s oeuvre. A financial injection from the club\u2019s new Abu Dhabi-based owners in 2008 transformed the club. It took a remarkable finish to the 2011-12 season for City to win its first Premier League title \u2013 Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s last-minute goal has gone down in history as one of the most dramatic endings to a season. But it was Guardiola\u2019s arrival in 2016 which truly transformed the club into serial winners. After conquering the domestic leagues, the final hurdle was continental glory and in 2023 City won a first European Cup final to become only the second English club to complete the \u2018Treble\u2019 as Champions League, FA Cup and Premier League winners. The Spaniard made winning a habit for City, and proceeded to erode the final few mental hoodoos around the club with his winning mentality. Sunday\u2019s title \u2013 which City won by finishing two points ahead of Guardiola\u2019s disciple, Mikel Arteta, and Arsenal \u2013 reiterated the team\u2019s dominance. Whether it be Erling Haaland\u2019s goalscoring prowess, Jo\u0161ko Gvardiol\u2019s reinvention from center-back to attacking left-back or Phil Foden\u2019s Player of the Season-winning campaign, Guardiola has once again proved why he\u2019s at the forefront of his profession. However, City\u2019s dominance comes against the backdrop of the Premier League accusing the club in February 2023 of breaching more than 100 financial rules, which includes failing to provide accurate financial information, failing to comply with UEFA\u2019s financial fair play (FFP) regulations, and failing to follow Premier League rules on profit and sustainability. The league referred City to an independent commission. The club has continuously denied any wrongdoing and a conclusion to their case reportedly remains some time away. \u2018I have a contract\u2019 Departing West Ham manager David Moyes, whose side was defeated by City on the final day of the season, said Guardiola is \u201csecond to none.\u201d \u201cThere used to be an argument that clubs couldn\u2019t win the title back-to-back,\u201d he told Sky Sports. \u201cHe has blown that sky-high. Four in a row is incredible. \u201cEveryone in football is in awe of his coaching but there is more to it than that. He is a really good man-manager and has the ability to control players. Either that or he has some hairdryer because he has got them on a string because they won\u2019t step out of place.\u201d City has the opportunity to cap off another memorable season with yet more silverware in the form of the FA Cup. Guardiola\u2019s team faces rival United in the final on Saturday. While Guardiola and winning have become synonymous, the 53-year-old admits it does come with its motivational setbacks. \u201cI had that feeling last season [after we won the treble],\u201d he said in his press conference following Sunday\u2019s title victory. \u201cWe were in Istanbul and I said: \u2018It\u2019s over. What am I doing here? There is nothing left.\u2019 But I have a contract. I am here and I am still enjoying some of the moments, sometimes tired but some of them I love. \u201cAnd after a few days, we start playing good, winning games, different players, and we start to think about how no one has done four in a row. Why not try it? Now, I am feeling it is done. What next? I don\u2019t know, right now. Well, I know it is FA Cup.\u201d So what\u2019s next for City and Guardiola? \u201cBut, next season, right now, I am not able to know what will be the motivation to do it. It is difficult sometimes to find it when everything is done. \u201cBut I know that the players and myself will be there and think, why shouldn\u2019t we win today? Why not? Why should we not work as much as possible to do what we have to do?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/sport/pep-guardiola-future-man-city-premier-league-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2023_02_05_sport_head-injury-suicide-female-athletes-intl-spt-cmd", "text": "Kelly Catlin and Ellie Soutter never met, but they had a lot in common.  Both were commanding athletes: Catlin, a US track cyclist, was a three-times world champion and Olympic silver medalist, and Soutter, a snowboarder, was tipped to be one of Team Great Britain\u2019s strongest contenders for the 2022 Winter Olympics, having already won a bronze medal at the 2017 European Youth Olympic Festival.  Both were incredibly smart \u2013 Catlin was studying for a master\u2019s degree in computational and mathematical engineering at Stanford University, while Soutter learned to speak French in about six months, according to her father.   At times they almost seemed superhuman. In 2013, after only three weeks of formal training and having broken her wrist, Soutter became British Champion with her arm in a cast. Meanwhile, Catlin, who had a tenderness for children, once rode 80 miles through sleet and snow to speak to a grade school about her Olympic experience.    Yet these two women\u2019s lives were tragically cut short after they sustained serious head injuries in their pursuit of sporting greatness and then took their own lives. Catlin was 23, while Soutter died by suicide on her 18th birthday.  Females may be more susceptible to concussion, and they also have worse and prolonged symptoms after their injury than men, according to a review of 25 studies of sport-related concussion published in the Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine.  However, women remain significantly underrepresented within sport and exercise science research. This, leading experts warn, means they often do not get the treatment or aftercare they need following a head injury.  Women\u2019s sports have historically not received the same attention or funding as men\u2019s sports, Dr. Ann McKee, Director of the Boston University Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s been shown that women athletes are more likely to get a concussion, they tend to have longer recovery periods,\u201d McKee added. \u201cWe do not have enough information about what happens in the female brain. We don\u2019t know if women are biologically more susceptible to these injuries,\u201d she said, adding that some research suggests the size and musculature of women\u2019s necks could play a part. Kelly  Before becoming a track cyclist, Catlin, a triplet, was a national champion road cyclist and time trial national champion, her father Mark, told CNN. After winning a Canadian international race at 17 she was invited to an Olympic training camp for a try out, where, impressed by her performance numbers, coaches immediately offered her a position on the track pursuit team.  Catlin\u2019s father, Mark, told CNN, that his daughter was \u201cintense\u201d and \u201cambitious,\u201d attributes she channeled into her sporting life. Her life changed irrevocably in January 2019. Practicing fast downhill descents in the hills near Los Angeles, she crashed and went skidding down the road.  Despite suffering road rash, Catlin got back on her bike, and finished the ride. It wasn\u2019t her first crash \u2013 she had experienced 4 or 5 hard crashes before this, her father said, and after the latest, she didn\u2019t have any symptoms at the time.  But soon after, at a World Cup track event in Berlin, Catlin was gripped by a sudden and severe headache.   \u201cShe couldn\u2019t compete,\u201d her father said. \u201cKelly is kind of this stoical individual. And if she\u2019s rolling around on the ground, clutching her head, it has to be a severe thing.\u201d On closer inspection, Catlin\u2019s helmet from LA had dents in it. Her father told CNN that this, coupled with her symptoms, caused her family to become aware she had suffered a concussion, which was later confirmed with a diagnosis from Stanford\u2019s Health Centre.  A concussion is a brain injury which happens after a hit to the head or body causes the brain to move back and forth inside the skull, according to the CDC. When Catlin returned to the US, her father says she was examined by the track training center in Colorado. It was confirmed she suffered a concussion, and a return to training protocol was advised, but not implemented or communicated to her coach, he said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any follow-up from Colorado after this. I believe they assumed she would seek care at Stanford,\u201d he told CNN.  CNN has reached out to Stanford and USA Cycling for comment.  Catlin\u2019s symptoms didn\u2019t improve, and in weekly phone calls with her parents, she admitted she was struggling with schoolwork and was unable to concentrate. Stanford Health Center, having diagnosed Catlin with concussion with ongoing symptoms, recommended that she decrease her training for 2 weeks and then gradually build back up and start sessions with an athletic trainer, medical documents sent to CNN by her father show. She was referred to a concussion specialist, the document adds. She tried to train, but \u201cshe would have to stop because she got a severe headache just from walking,\u201d according to her father. Her heart rate would also accelerate rapidly from even the smallest exertion, leaving her with \u201cno exercise tolerance whatsoever,\u201d he added.  Her injury had other consequences. \u201cAs far as we knew she was never a person that suffered from depression. She had an interesting sense of humor.  She was always upbeat and bubbly about things,\u201d her father told CNN.  \u201cShe basically thought her life was over. She was no longer able to be the athlete that she was, she was failing her teammates. And she wasn\u2019t able to succeed in school now. And I think ultimately, that\u2019s why she took her life, because she thought her life was over,\u201d he added.  At the end of January, Catlin made a serious but non-fatal suicide attempt, and was involuntarily admitted to the locked psychiatric ward at Stanford, her father told CNN. A month after that attempt, she took her own life.     Ellie   Soutter\u2019s father Tony said there were many dimensions to his young daughter \u2013 not only was she an \u201cadrenaline junkie,\u201d but she was \u201cvery conscientious\u201d and excelled in school, even after moving from England to France.   Aged 12, Soutter took up snowboarding at school \u2013 and just months later, she was spotted in her hometown resort of Les Gets and trialed by Team Great Britain in February 2013.  \u201cIt was quite obvious why she kept winning competitions because she just made it easy,\u201d her father said. \u201cShe just made it look graceful and beautiful.\u201d But training took its toll \u2013 Soutter told CNN that his daughter suffered seven major concussions in five years, between 2013 and 2018.  \u201cI was being advised by doctors \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, she\u2019s young enough she\u2019ll bounce back. As she progressed, becoming an elite athlete starting on the World Cup circuit, every time she had another concussion, they got worse, and they took longer to recover from,\u201d he told CNN.     \u201cWith every concussion, with the exception of a few minor knocks, Ellie saw a doctor in person,\u201d he added. \u201cI was always told that she was young enough to bounce back to full health after each case and therefore never consulted with the doctors that I met, about any previous concussions.\u201d But Soutter\u2019s final concussion was so \u201chuge\u201d that she spent two nights in the hospital. \u201cWhen I got there, she didn\u2019t even know who I was or where she was,\u201d her father said. Soutter was then selected for the Junior Snowboard World Championships in New Zealand August 2018.  But a month before the competition, she died by suicide.  Her father said a neurologist conducted a CT scan of her brain and reaction tests three months after her final concussion, but said she was \u201cabsolutely fine\u201d and could continue competing.                                                                                                                                 Like Catlin, Soutter had issues with studying and concentrating, becoming more insular as she suffered from crippling headaches. She also started suffering from insomnia.  \u201cShe would literally sit with the tutor a good month after a concussion, and suddenly, she\u2019d go blind. She\u2019d not be able to see \u2013 everything would go black and dark,\u201d her father said. After missing a flight to snowboard training, Soutter died by suicide on her 18th birthday. Team GB referred CNN to GB Snowsport when approached for comment, adding that Ellie only competed for Team GB at one event.  In order to represent Britain in international competitions, GB Snowsport says athletes or their coaches are required to demonstrate that the athlete has reached established performance criteria, is of the relevant technical ability to compete, and has appropriate medical clearance to compete. A large number of athletes can represent Britain at different levels of international competition but are not part of a programme delivered and overseen by GB Snowsport.  \u201cAs Ellie was not part of the GB Snowsport programme, we were unable to implement a personalised recovery and management programme for Ellie,\u201d a spokesperson for GB Snowsport told CNN in an email. \u201cShe was, however, covered by national policies and protocols around fitness to compete, and would not have been cleared for any activity \u2013 training or competition \u2013 overseen by GB Snowsport without being able to demonstrate appropriate medical sign-off,\u201d they added. The spokesperson for GB Snowsport told CNN: \u201cWe take concussions and head injuries incredibly seriously, and in reviewing contemporaneous records from the time that Ellie was involved in snowsport we are confident that GB Snowsport staff applied and followed every appropriate process.\u201d Catlin and Soutter aren\u2019t the only young sporting women whose lives have been cut short in this way. After 29-year-old Australian rules football player Jacinda Barclay took her life in 2020, post-mortem research by scientists found that she had degradation to her cerebral white matter unusual for someone her age.  \u201cFor someone her age, you would expect to see lovely pristine white matter, and hers looked like she was an old woman in that it was basically degraded,\u201d Michael Buckland, founder and Executive Director of the Australian Sports Brain Bank, who studied Barclay\u2019s brain, told CNN.  \u201cWe haven\u2019t gone back and done specific white matter studies on our donors,\u201d he told CNN, adding that the bank hasn\u2019t done peer reviewed research on this.  \u201cBut what struck me, just as someone that sees a lot of brains \u2013 this is not normal for someone of that age.\u201d  Damage to white matter has been associated with dementia, according to research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.   Opportunities missed Suicide after concussion is rare. However patients diagnosed with concussion or mild traumatic brain injury had double the risk of suicide and a higher risk of suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts than people without brain injuries, a 2018 study from researchers at the University of Harvard published in JAMA Neurology found. Dr. Robert Cantu, clinical professor of neurology at the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at Boston University School of Medicine told CNN that there are several theories as to why incidence of suicide is higher in people who have suffered concussion. One theory, he explained, is that those suffering from persistent post-concussion symptoms may have structural or functional brain damage and could be experiencing \u201cbehavioral dysregulation: short fuse, irritability, [and] can\u2019t suppress impulses the way you normally could.\u201d   With these emotional problems, \u201cthey would be more prone to perhaps do something impulsive, like commit suicide,\u201d Cantu, medical director of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, told CNN. A second theory, Cantu noted, is that post-concussive symptoms prevent people from getting back into their sport and stop them \u201cfrom being the person that they were before their injury.\u201d Neither theory is proven to the exclusion of the other, Cantu said, adding he thinks increased suicidality was \u201ca combined factor involving both in many, if not most cases.\u201d There are also differences in the way brain injuries affect women.  A study of female soccer players across US high schools found they are nearly twice as likely to suffer concussion as their male counterparts, according to research that looked at over 80,000 adolescent athletes, published in the journal JAMA Network Open.  Women remain significantly underrepresented within sport and exercise science research: a 2021 study examining papers from some of the most influential sports medical journals found that only 6% of the studies were solely focused on women, compared with 31% of studies that included just men. Other researchers have pointed to female sex hormones, with risk of concussion changing with hormone levels during a menstrual cycle.  McKee said all athletes can also experience \u201cnon-concussive\u201d injuries: \u201chits to the head that can be of the same magnitude as concussion, but they don\u2019t rise to the level of symptoms for whatever reason, so a player tends to play right through it.\u201d Cumulative exposure to repetitive head impacts \u2013 including concussion and non- concussive injuries \u2013 increases the risk for the neurodegenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known as CTE, McKee said.  The disease, which can only be formally diagnosed with an autopsy, has mostly been seen in either veterans or people who played contact sports, particularly American football, say researchers. The disease occurs when the brain starts to degenerate likely due to repeated head traumas, according to the Mayo Clinic, which notes CTE is \u201cassociated with recurrent concussions.\u201d But scientists aren\u2019t only concerned about concussions.  Previous studies have shown subconcussive head impacts \u2013 repetitive hits to the head and body that do not cause symptoms \u2013 can still result in long-term neurological disease.   According to The Concussion Legacy Foundation, \u201cthe best available evidence suggests that subconcussive impacts, not concussions, are the driving force behind CTE.\u201d There have been cases of CTE discovered in athletes who have never been diagnosed with a concussion, according to the Concussion Legacy Foundation. And other changes in the brain after repetitive head impacts aside from CTE are likely \u201cequally important,\u201d McKee said. \u201cWe also see damage to the white matter. And that appears to be mostly in the frontal lobe, but also in the temporal lobes,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to understand the relationship of those white matter changes to behavioral and mood symptoms, perhaps even suicidality,\u201d she said.  McKee stressed that concussion management is important, but physicians and athletes should also be aware of other injuries. \u201cThe problem is the subclinical hits \u2013 the non-concussive injuries that aren\u2019t detected, you don\u2019t pull the player off the field \u2013 and they can be in the hundreds or even the 1000s in a single season,\u201d she explained. Lack of research  Though a growing body of data suggests women in sport are more likely to sustain a concussion, have more severe symptoms, and to take longer to recover, most sports-related concussions protocols are based on data from men.  In a review in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers looked at 171 concussion studies written since 1967 which are used to inform the most influential consensus and position statements in treating sports-related concussions. Clinicians rely on these documents to guide their medical practice when treating athletes \u2013 but most of the studies are focused on men. Only 1% of them was looking exclusively at concussions in women and 40% of them didn\u2019t have any women in a sample of participants at all.   There is another risk factor for women in sport when they sustain head injuries, Katherine Snedaker, founder and executive director of PINK Concussions, a non-profit dedicated to women\u2019s health and brain injury, told CNN.  There is a gulf of millions of dollars separating women and men when it comes to average annual salaries in most professional sports. Outside of elite sport, Snedaker says, female athletes often don\u2019t have access to the same medical care as men, meaning head injuries aren\u2019t spotted as routinely.   \u201cThey tend to push really hard through the injury,\u201d she said. And many women can\u2019t afford to take time out to recover: even professional athletes will supplement their sports income with other jobs, she added, and many are caregivers. \u201cWhen they really crater, it\u2019s a couple of days or weeks later.\u201d  Snedaker said female athletes often weren\u2019t aware they had suffered a head injury. If they were, she said, there were no appropriate medical or sporting staff to inform. Not enough support The families of Catlin and Soutter feel the young women didn\u2019t get enough support after their injuries. After Catlin\u2019s first suicide attempt, she was released from an involuntary admission to the psychiatric ward after threatening legal action, and a conference between psychiatrists, her coach and her parents.  She attended therapy sessions, which she agreed to attend during the conference, but found \u201cthey were geared toward suicidal freshman with a whole set of different issues than an elite Olympic athlete,\u201d her father told CNN. She got a referral to a sports psychologist that worked with the Stanford athletic department, but the department forbade the psychologist from seeing Catlin because she was not a varsity athlete, her father added.  She contacted the office of a sports psychologist with whom she had developed a rapport while in the hospital \u2013 but, his appointment secretary said he had no openings for six months, her father told CNN.  \u201cWherever she turned she could not find help,\u201d he said, adding that his daughter tried a suicide hotline several times: she was once put on hold and once received no answer. Catlin described his daughter as a \u201cstoic, female warrior type person that isn\u2019t going to admit that she\u2019s struggling.\u201d  \u201cShe needed a sports psychiatrist that really could understand what she was going through and understand the rigors of her life in terms of preparation for competitions and the athletic side of it and what it could potentially do to you.\u201d Her father said a major factor in his daughter\u2019s death was \u201ca lack of communication between the facilities that were involved in Kelly\u2019s care. No one was in charge and they assumed the other institutions were following up when they weren\u2019t,\u201d he added. In a statement sent to CNN, Luisa Rapport, director of emergency communications and media relations at Stanford University did not address any of the specific allegations made by Catlin\u2019s family.  She said while the university does not discuss in the media the details of individual students\u2019 experiences, \u201csupporting the mental and emotional health of students is a critical priority for Stanford.\u201d  \u201cStudents in need of mental health crisis assistance \u2013 including students having suicidal thoughts \u2013 and those who are concerned about students in need of assistance, can contact the University\u2019s Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) 24 hours-a-day, seven days-a-week,\u201d she added. Rapport said that in addition to this, \u201cthere are multiple places where psychological services may be provided for students depending on individualized need and treatment recommendations, including, for example, affiliated hospital services and clinics through Stanford\u2019s Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, and mental health programs and clinicians in the community.\u201d In a statement sent to CNN, USA Cycling said it was \u201cdevastated\u201d by Catlin\u2019s death, adding: \u201cShe brought focus and determination to everything she did, and served as an inspiration to everyone who knew her.  \u201cAs the National Governing Body for the sport of cycling, USA Cycling prioritizes the holistic wellbeing of the riders on the U.S. National Team and has a longstanding commitment to providing both physical and mental health resources to members of the team,\u201d a representative for USA Cycling added.   After his daughter Ellie\u2019s death, Soutter was contacted by the UNITE Brain Bank, who wanted to study her brain as part of their research into CTE. But even in that facility \u2013 the biggest of its kind in the world \u2013 of some 1,300 brains, only 3% belonged to women, Ann McKee, Director of the Boston University Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center told CNN. \u201cWhen I actually started looking into CTE \u2013 all of the work that they\u2019ve done with the footballers in America, she had every single symptom and more,\u201d Soutter told CNN. \u201cIt was quite obvious to me that there was a definite link in her starting to get into dark places and feeling bad and anxious and not sleeping properly. All of those symptoms \u2026 Every one that\u2019s involved in CTE was part of Ellie\u2019s life,\u201d he added. \u201cI truly believe today that my daughter would be alive had I had any inkling, you know, even the smallest bit of information.\u201d Editor\u2019s Note: If you are in the US and you or a loved one have contemplated suicide, call The National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255) to connect with a trained counselor.

{"id": "2024_05_08_sport_chris-birch-nasa-astronaut-cycling-spt-scn-intl", "text": "Scroll through the athlete profiles on the USA Cycling website and you\u2019ll find someone whose favorite movie is listed as \u201cInterstellar\u201d \u2013 Christopher Nolan\u2019s acclaimed sci-fi adventure released in 2014. \u201cI love realistic space movies \u2026 I\u2019m definitely a nerd,\u201d reads Chris Birch\u2019s answer on her profile page. That response proved prescient: shortly after stepping away from her professional cycling career, the Arizona native was selected from more than 12,000 applicants to join NASA\u2019s astronaut class of 2021. As career sidesteps go, it was an unusual one, though Birch had an extensive background in science with degrees in mathematics, biochemistry and molecular biophysics, and a doctorate in biological engineering. The further she progressed with her application to join NASA, the more convinced she became that she had a future in spaceflight. Interviews with panels of current and former astronauts, she thought, were stimulating, not intimidating, and so too were the selection exercises undertaken with other candidates. \u201cI really just had a blast,\u201d Birch tells CNN Sport. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like an interview at all, it didn\u2019t feel like a test. It was just super fun. And it felt like fun and games for me.\u201d It\u2019s now been close to two and a half years since Birch joined NASA, and in that time, she has practiced for space walks, learned to fly T-38 training jets and developed skills needed to operate the robotic arm on the International Space Station. Her training also involved acquiring expeditionary skills, understanding how to operate the complex systems on the space station, and even becoming proficient in Russian, the language needed to fly the Soyuz spacecraft. When she graduated at Houston\u2019s Johnson Space Center in March, the 37-year-old had few qualms about the unexpected U-turn her career had taken, her appetite for spaceflight keener than ever before. \u201cI absolutely would love to explore off this planet,\u201d says Birch. \u201cI think there\u2019s a pretty good shot that I\u2019ll get to go do science aboard the International Space Station, maybe even get to do some wrenching outside and work on making some upgrades. \u201cIt would be an absolute career highlight to be able to go back to the moon as part of one of the Artemis missions and do science on the moon.\u201d Birch left academia in 2018 to pursue a career in professional cycling, going on to win 11 national titles and represent the US at the world championships on several occasions. It was around the time that she was training to make the team for the postponed Tokyo Olympics that Birch applied to join NASA, and when she missed out on selection for the Games, she decided to throw herself wholly into her new pursuit. Despite the evident differences in cycling and spaceflight, she believes that the same sense of curiosity and wonder has motivated her in both disciplines. \u201cI think there\u2019s something really powerful about being surrounded by a group of people that are all trying deliberately to not walk the path most trodden,\u201d says Birch. \u201cWe\u2019re all looking to push the envelope in some way, and that has always been my driving mantra. The whole reason I pursued a PhD is I wanted to discover something, to build something that had never been done before. \u201cMy fascination with sport was all about seeing how fast we could go. Can we push the human body \u2013 my body, my mind \u2013 farther than I thought I could go? It really was a natural extension of that inner drive for me, if not a slight change in the technical topics.\u201d Joining NASA has meant that Birch\u2019s days of flying around a velodrome at lightning-bolt speeds are over, but her desire to test her physical limits remains. She has turned her focus towards endurance challenges, completing the iconic Leadville Trail 100 mountain bike race \u2013 a 100-mile course with 12,000 feet of elevation gain in Colorado \u2013 last year, as well as racing the Houston Marathon in January. On her radar is an attempt to break the women\u2019s time record for cycling north to south across Montana, some 400 miles on gravel roads. Challenges like that are not so far removed from astronaut training, which involves group expeditions in the field, living in the wilderness for days at a time and learning how to handle stress in a critical, unforgiving environment. \u201cCycling in particular \u2013 it just supports so much suffering,\u201d says Birch. \u201cIt\u2019s a really great avenue to practice mental toughness. It doesn\u2019t cost much, versus for me to go out and fly in a multi-engine jet aircraft is thousands of dollars an hour. \u201cThis is something that I can go do and practice that toughness training, especially if I\u2019m descending on a mountain bike trail, six hours in and I\u2019m really tired \u2013 I\u2019m now making critical handling decisions in response to my environment. \u201cI feel like that translates really well to being able to do that in the jet \u2013 it\u2019s the same mental clarity, mental focus you have to maintain. I think it\u2019s an awesome space to practice that.\u201d Birch is now firmly focused on her first projects since graduating. Recently, that\u2019s involved supporting Artemis II recovery training in the Pacific Ocean, off the coast from California. The Artemis II mission, now scheduled for September 2025 after a delay of several months, aims to send four astronauts on a journey to fly by the moon, and being able to prepare for the safe recovery of the astronauts and the capsule, Birch says, gave an \u201cincredible appreciation for the needs of the crew,\u201d even while she\u2019s still a rookie. There\u2019s no obvious timeline or pathway for when or how she might be able to venture away from planet Earth herself, but it remains a firm ambition in her life and career. \u201cI\u2019m going to prepare for that the same way I would prepare for a race,\u201d says Birch, \u201cshow up every day and give 100% to the team. If the timing works out, then that\u2019s great. But I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/sport/chris-birch-nasa-astronaut-cycling-spt-scn-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_sport_police-officials-charges-against-golfer-scottie-scheffler", "text": "High ranking police officials in Louisville, Kentucky, have privately voiced concerns that the felony charge against world No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler \u2013 who reportedly tried to drive around the scene of a fatal crash \u2013 is excessive, a source familiar with the discussions told CNN. It\u2019s the first indication some top brass at the Louisville Metro Police Department believe the charges against Scheffler should be reduced. The 27-year-old golfer was attempting to drive to the PGA Championship at Valhalla Golf Club at about 6 a.m. on May 17 when he came to the scene of a fatal crash. He injured a police officer who was directing traffic and was then detained and arrested, according to police. Scheffler was charged with felony second-degree assault on a police officer, along with lesser charges of third-degree criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding signals from officers directing traffic, according to Jefferson County court records. He was released from jail and returned to the golf course for his tee time in the second round of the major tournament. In a statement last week, Scheffler said he proceeded as directed and \u201cthere was a big misunderstanding of what I thought I was being asked to do.\u201d Scheffler\u2019s attorney, Steven Romines, told CNN in a statement Friday he plans to plead not guilty to the charges. During a recent meeting, multiple Louisville police officials discussed the charges against Scheffler,\u00a0and the group\u00a0agreed\u00a0that the felony charge seems excessive given the details of the case, according to the source with firsthand knowledge of the meeting. It is unclear whether they have discussed those opinions with the county attorney prosecuting the case\u00a0and how that may ultimately affect the charging decision. \u201cAs we have stated previously, no decisions have been made regarding the prosecution of the case involving Mr. Scheffler,\u201d said Josh Abner, a spokesperson for the Jefferson County Attorney\u2019s office. \u201cWe continue to gather information and will review and proceed accordingly.\u201d Police to hold Thursday news conference Louisville police will hold a news conference Thursday to address the case and are expected to release additional video of the arrest from a traffic pole camera. It is unclear if the initial encounter between Scheffler and the detective was captured on video. Police will investigate whether Det. Bryan Gillis, whose body camera was not turned on, followed department protocols during the incident, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said at a news conference Tuesday. \u201cI think that\u2019s critically important that we do that, not just in high profile events like took place on Friday, but on a regular basis,\u201d Greenberg added. \u201cAnd if policies are not being followed, there will be transparency about that. There will be action taken.\u201d O\u2019Connell\u2019s office is facing growing pressure from other local officials to reassess the charges against Scheffler. Louisville Councilmember Anthony Piagentini, who represents the district where Scheffler was arrested, told CNN he believes the case is being overcharged. \u201cI think the charges should either be dropped entirely or at least be dropped down to a very, very tiny misdemeanor,\u201d Piagentini said. \u201cI don\u2019t know every piece of evidence, but I know enough to say the officer was trying to do his job, Mr. Scheffler was trying to do his job, and an unfortunate circumstance happened.\u201d Piagentini said he found it strange O\u2019Connell showed up to court Monday to argue against delaying the arraignment, which Romines requested because of a scheduling issue the attorney was facing. \u201cThat\u2019s such a minor procedural detail,\u201d Piagentini said, adding that O\u2019Connell typically would have a different member of his team argue such a motion in court. \u201cHis actions have indicated he\u2019s treating this case differently, and he shouldn\u2019t.\u201d CNN also has reached out to the Louisville Metro Police Department for comment. Scheffler is scheduled to play Thursday in the Charles Schwab Challenge, in Fort Worth, Texas. He has a 1:45 p.m. ET tee time.

Korda\u2019s victory makes her the first LPGA Tour golfer since Inbee Park in 2013 to tally six victories in a season and the first American since 1990 when Beth Daniel won seven times. \u201cOh, my gosh, six, I can\u2019t even really gather myself right now with that, the head-to-head that Hannah (Green) and I had pretty much all day,\u201d Korda said. \u201cWasn\u2019t my best stuff out there today but fought really hard on the back nine.\u201d A week after Rose Zhang snapped Korda\u2019s record-tying streak of five victories in five starts at the Cognizant Founders Classic, the eighth-year LPGA Tour golfer slowly climbed the leaderboard throughout the tournament, after trailing by four strokes after the first round. Then came moving day, where Korda rounded into the form expected from the top-ranked women\u2019s golfer, battling through wind and light rain to post a blistering 7-under 65 to sit at 13-under for a two-stroke lead over the world No. 2 Green. On Friday, the now 14-time LPGA Tour winner improved on her score by carding a 4-under 68 to move from 17th\u00a0place into a tie for third place heading into the weekend. Sunday\u2019s round did not prove easy for Korda after an early birdie by Green on the first\u00a0hole and a bogey by the American on the second hole leveled the two golfers at 12-under. The two-time major champion regained her lead with a birdie on the fourth hole, but then ran into trouble, bogeying the fifth\u00a0and seventh holes to drop to 11-under and one shot back of Green,  a five-time LPGA Tour winner. Following a bogey  by Green on the eighth hole, the two were tied again for the lead, along with Ayaka Furue, who momentarily moved into first place. \u201cYeah, definitely was not a good start to the day,\u201d Korda said. \u201cJust couldn\u2019t get anything going, and Jay actually told me to pretty much get my head out of my um and to reset and to start fresh. There were opportunities that I could take advantage of on the back nine and it was still a tight race. \u201cEven though I was 2-over, I was still tied for the lead, so it\u2019s not like I was completely discouraged with my play. Overall, you know, definitely tough start to the day and then grind it out on the back nine.\u201d Korda and Green matched each other\u2019s scores over the next nine holes, with birdies on the 10th, 13th\u00a0and 15th\u00a0holes, respectively, to set up a tournament-deciding 18th. The American teed off into the fairway on the par-4 final hole, while Green pulled her shot left into the rough. The Australian again found herself in the rough on her approach shot, while Korda held her nerve to get her second shot within 15 feet of the hole. Green chipped her third shot over a bunker to fall on the green and set up a lengthy putt attempt for par. Meanwhile, Korda two-putted in for par to shift the pressure over to Green, who missed her potential tournament-extending putt. \u201cIt was just amazing to share the stage with Hannah,\u201d Korda said. \u201cI consider her a pretty good friend out here, and it was a lot of fun going head-to-head against her.\u201d Korda shot a final-round 71 to finish at 14-under for the one-stroke victory over Green. Chanettee Wannasaen, Ariya Jutanugarn, Jennifer Kupcho and Gabriela Ruffels all tied for third place.

{"id": "2024_05_25_sport_scotland-soccer-religious-bigotry-intl-spt", "text": "Surrounded by medics, Hibernian FC player Martin Boyle lay on the pitch after diving for the ball in a Scottish Cup quarterfinal earlier this year and landing awkwardly on his head \u2013 the then 30-year-old suffered a concussion \u2013 an injury he would later describe as having sent him to \u201chell and back.\u201d The game was stopped for around 10 minutes, but as medics tended to the injured forward, chants of \u201cdie ya Fenian bastard\u201d sung by some fans of the opposing team Rangers FC echoed throughout the stadium in Edinburgh. Fenian refers to a group of 19th\u00a0century Irish revolutionaries but is widely recognized as a derogatory term for Irish Catholics. The language mirrors the division caused by centuries of war and strife between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, in part because of the west of Scotland\u2019s close historical links with Northern Ireland. \u201cOver recent years supporters\u2019 unacceptable conduct has become rife in Scotland whether that be through the use of pyrotechnics, sectarianism, objects being thrown onto the field of play or through other actions,\u201d Hibernian FC, commonly known as Hibs said in a statement in response to the chanting. Police Scotland told CNN it had received no reports regarding fans\u2019 behavior towards Boyle. A spokesperson added: \u201cI can confirm a man was arrested in connection with comments being made towards Rangers fans/staff, however, he was released without charge.\u201d David Scott, director of Nil by Mouth \u2013 a Scottish charity that campaigns against religious bigotry \u2013 told CNN \u201csectarianism is something that\u2019s very woven into the game of football.\u201d He explained that \u201cpassion, performance, poison\u201d are at the heart of the game in Scotland, with bigoted chanting taking the forefront. \u201cIt was a historic problem born of the Catholic-Protestant divide in Scottish society, especially in the West of Scotland. And it became greatly manifest in football,\u201d Scottish sports journalist Graham Spiers told CNN. \u201cThat in the main has meant anti-Catholic chanting. This is not anti-Protestant. It\u2019s not anti-Asian, it\u2019s not anti-Semitic. In the main, it has been about anti-Catholic and anti-Irish chanting,\u201d Spiers added. A problem rooted in history The fierce rivalry between Glasgow\u2019s two most famous teams \u2013 Celtic FC and Rangers \u2013 is historically one of the most vivid examples of sectarianism in Scottish football, and society. The two teams play each other in Saturday\u2019s Scottish Cup final. Historically chants have included anti-Catholic religious bigotry, or vocal support for paramilitary groups like the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). Celtic, founded by an Irish member of a Catholic religious order in 1887, wears its heritage proudly in the four-leaf clover of its team emblem. Meanwhile, Rangers, founded in 1872, was \u201chistorically and shamefully\u201d a mostly Protestant club until the 1980s, Spiers explained. \u201cRangers didn\u2019t hide it, they were proud of the fact they were all Protestant,\u201d he said. These historically religious identities and rivalries \u2013 often described as \u201cScotland\u2019s shame\u201d \u2013 extend to other Scottish clubs, including Edinburgh\u2019s historically Catholic Hibernian and Protestant Hearts of Midlothian FC. Perhaps the most violent chapter in the sectarian sports rivalry happened in 1995, when 16-year-old Celtic fan Mark Scott was killed by a man who police say had family links to a Protestant paramilitary group.  Scott was wearing a Celtic scarf while walking past a pub frequented by Loyalist fans on his way home from a match on the day of his murder. Jason Campbell was arrested, tried and convicted in 1996 for the killing. He was sentenced to life in prison but was freed on parole in 2011 following human rights legislation. And though Scotland has become more secular than when these clubs were founded some 150 years ago, \u201cthese tribal loyalties remain,\u201d said Nil by Mouth\u2019s Scott. \u201cWhen you\u2019re singing and chanting these things, you may think you\u2019re just thinking about your tradition, your background, but actually other people may just hear the hatred and agonism,\u201d said Scott. \u201cAcross the city, people will sing songs, \u2018We\u2019re up to our knees in Fenian blood, surrender or you\u2019ll die.\u2019 \u201cThey will tell you that, \u2018This is just theater, these are just words that don\u2019t mean anything, these are football chants,\u2019 that people like me are taking it too seriously. It\u2019s all culture. But it can also be a very intimidating atmosphere to be at,\u201d Scott added. According to Spiers, Celtic\u2019s support is \u201cmaybe 70% Catholic, but with a very large Protestant minority, who are Celtic fans. And they also have songs about \u2018Orange [named after King William III, also known as William of Orange and a political society] bastards,\u2019 meaning Protestants.\u201d Geographically, these are clubs whose support cuts across the geography of Scotland as well as social class, said Scott. \u201cPeople don\u2019t go to church anymore,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople don\u2019t live in these kinds of working class communities in Scotland where they used to do \u2013 people are more spread out. I think football becomes this kind of social cement that links people to parts of their past.\u201d Authorities have tried to tackle the problem, introducing legislation including The Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Act 2012, which was repealed in 2018. \u201cIf you\u2019re watching football matches with five or 10,000 people or whatever it is shouting and chanting, you can\u2019t arrest them. So you have to come up with a system of addressing that,\u201d Scott explained. There were 576 charges with a religious aggravation reported in 2022-23 according to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS), an 8% increase on the previous 12 months. The COPFS reports that \u201cover the last five years, the number of religious charges reported has fluctuated between around 530 and 670 per year.\u201d This April, Scotland\u2019s new hate crime law came into force, which focuses on \u201cstirring up hatred,\u201d \u201cracially aggravated harassment\u201d and crimes \u201caggravated by prejudice\u201d with regard to age, disability, impairment, religion, sexual orientation, transgender identity and sex characteristics \u2013 though Scott describes this law as a \u201cred herring\u201d when it comes to addressing bigotry in football given previous legislation\u00a0didn\u2019t solve the problem. A spokesperson for the Scottish Government told CNN that it is \u201cfully committed to tackling all forms of bigotry and prejudice including sectarianism.\u201d The spokesperson highlighted the new Hate Crime and Public Order Act as a mechanism to tackle hatred and prejudice, and said the government would support the police in \u201ctaking appropriate and proportionate action to safeguard public safety.\u201d Joseph Webster, Professor of the Anthropology of Religion at the University of Cambridge, told CNN that his own research shows that the majority of \u201coffensive chanting\u201d occurs when only one fan group is present, in spaces like a social club or pub, and can \u201cfoster intra-group solidarity.\u201d Webster added that his research shows an unintended consequence of the now defunct Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Act 2012 \u201cis that those fan bases feel unfairly targeted by the police, and the result is they look inward, among themselves even further, and the chanting then escalates.\u201d CNN has reached out to Police Scotland, Scottish Football Association, Rangers and Celtic for comment. Hiding a wider problem Jeanette Findlay, the Chair, and a founding member of Call it Out, a campaign against anti-Irish racism and anti-Catholic bigotry, said that outrage over anti-Catholic chanting in football is \u201ca long running diversion by the Scottish government, Scottish society.\u201d \u201cThe Scottish government and polite Scottish society don\u2019t like to acknowledge that there is, across Scottish society, geographically and in class terms, a continued anti-Catholic bigotry,\u201d she told CNN Sport, explaining that the vast majority of Catholics in Scotland are of Irish descent. The Scottish Government referred CNN to its previous statement when asked about these claims. Findlay says that the government often comments that the problem is contained to football, and by association, areas lived in by the working class. \u201cCatholics are more likely to live in poorer areas, they are over represented in the prison system, hugely overrepresented in religious aggravated hate crime. We are over represented in certain health conditions,\u201d she added. Scottish government data backs up those observations of Findlay. In almost half of religion aggravated hate crimes, \u201cthe perpetrator showed prejudice towards the Catholic community\u201d (47%), according to a Police Scotland report which reviewed recorded crimes in 2020-21. The next largest groups were Muslims and Protestants, who each made up 16% of cases, the report data based on a random sample of cases, found. In 2022-23, police noted that around one in 10 hate crimes were religiously aggravated, though this data set did not disclose which religions were targeted. Findlay said that, while she has heard hostile chants at football matches, \u201cfrankly, I\u2019m more concerned with the employment statistics, and the justice statistics and the health statistics which are more of a problem for us.\u201d \u201cSomeone calling us a Fenian bastard and threatening us on a football pitch doesn\u2019t cause us much trouble. \u201cIf they were marching past places of worship, spitting on our priests and vandalizing our churches, that\u2019s a problem. If they were standing at the door, shouting up, that should be dealt with,\u201d she added. Journalist Spiers said that, although Rangers \u201cmodernized\u201d long ago following pressure from fans and the media, prejudicial songs and their associated meanings \u201cstill hangs around Rangers like a bad stench.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019ve been at Rangers games in recent years where the atmosphere has been great \u2013 nobody is more sensitive than I am to chanting because God knows I\u2019ve written about it for 25 years.\u201d But \u201cevery so often, it will flare up and we all go. \u2018All right. It\u2019s still there. The old problem is still there.\u2019 But it\u2019s not as regular as it was 10, 20, 30, 40 years ago\u201d Spiers added. \u201cPeople find it tedious and boring and tragic. I\u2019m not actually offended by these chants, but I\u2019m embarrassed for my country. I\u2019m embarrassed for Scotland, that people will say \u2013 why are they singing about Catholics, you know, as if it\u2019s as if it\u2019s the 1920s or the 1890s?\u201d Webster is one of many who cautions against relying on legislation alone to deal with bigotry, adding: \u201cI think most people would agree that you can\u2019t prevent someone from holding bigoted attitudes by arresting them.\u201d Celtic recently won the Scottish Premiership, edging Rangers to the title. Saturday\u2019s cup final offers Rangers a chance to stop its rival from winning the double, but given the clubs\u2019 complicated history, how their respective fanbases behave will also be closely watched.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/sport/scotland-soccer-religious-bigotry-intl-spt/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_sport_individual-neutral-athlete-olympics-explainer-spt-intl", "text": "Russian athletes have competed under several different guises throughout the 128-year history of the Olympics, and they will be known by another new name at Paris 2024. Following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine \u2013 supported by Belarus \u2013 in February 2022, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes should be prohibited from competing in international sporting events. In January 2023, the IOC announced its intention to allow these athletes to compete as neutrals, in a similar way to how Russian and Belarusian tennis players are presented at ATP, WTA and Grand Slam events without any reference to their nationality. The Russian Olympic Committee was then suspended entirely by the IOC in October 2023 when it absorbed Ukrainian regional sports organizations in Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia. There has been much debate around whether Russian and Belarusian athletes should be permitted to take part in the Olympics, with Ukrainian athletes in particular voicing their concerns. However, the IOC Executive Board ruled that it would be unfair to punish athletes based on their passports alone, thereby allowing some to compete in Paris, albeit under very strict conditions. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes at the 2024 Olympics. \u2018No flag, anthem, colors\u2019 An Individual Neutral Athlete is the name used to refer to athletes with either a Russian or Belarusian passport who will be competing at this year\u2019s Games in July and August. These athletes are referred to by the abbreviation AIN, which comes from the French translation Athl\u00e8tes Individuels Neutres. These athletes will be permitted to compete if they meet eligibility requirements. No reference to either country will be made at the Games through the athletes\u2019 participation. \u201cThe sanctions against those responsible for the war, the Russian and Belarusian states and governments, remain in place for the Olympic Games Paris 2024,\u201d the IOC said in a statement. \u201cNo flag, anthem, colors or any other identifications whatsoever of Russia or Belarus will be displayed at the Olympic Games Paris 2024 in any official venue or any official function,\u201d the statement continues. Competition gear for the AINs has not yet been revealed, so it is unclear whether it will bear the turquoise colors of the brand-new flag of the AINs, or that they will don basic sportswear. An anthem \u2013 without lyrics \u2013 has also been commissioned for use in medal ceremonies. Though AINs are eligible to compete and win Olympic medals, they will not be displayed in the medal table of nations. AINs will also be excluded from the parade of delegations at the Opening Ceremony on the basis that they are individual athletes rather than a team, though the IOC has said \u201can opportunity will be provided for them to experience the event.\u201d Individual Neutral Athlete Eligibility Review Panel In December 2023, the Executive Board of the IOC decided that Russian and Belarusian athletes who qualified through the existing qualification systems of international federations would have to meet strict requirements if they are to be selected as an AIN. There will be no Russian or Belarusian representation in team events, with participation limited to individual competition. Per the IOC, athletes who actively support the war or who are contracted to the Russian or Belarusian military or national security agencies will not be eligible to be entered or to compete. The same stipulation applies to support personnel. Like all other athletes, AINs will need to meet anti-doping requirements to be considered for selection. The eligibility of these athletes will be determined by the newly established Individual Neutral Athlete Eligibility Review Panel. Two-time NBA champion and six-time All-Star Pau Gasol is part of the panel, representing the IOC Ethics Commission. The Spaniard will sit alongside IOC Vice-President and former artistic swimmer Nicole Hoevertsz, and former Olympic table tennis gold medalist Ryu Seung-min, who will be representing the Athletes\u2019 Commission. International sporting federations will need to submit their lists of qualified athletes to panel for review. At the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo (postponed to 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic) and the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, Russian athletes competed under the name of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) \u00a0as a result of the country\u2019s state-sponsored doping program. Athletes could compete under the ROC banner if they could prove that they were not connected to the scandal. However, with the ROC bearing both the name and colors of Russia \u2013 as well as the subsequent suspension of the ROC in October \u2013 it was no longer a viable option for Russian athletes to compete under this name in Paris. It is also important to note that the ROC was not a neutral body, rather a delegation of Russian athletes which technically didn\u2019t compete on the behalf of Russia, but retained a right to represent the country in all but an official capacity. Numbers of AINs at the Paris Olympics The IOC stated that, as of March 28, 12 AINs with a Russian passport and seven AINs with a Belarusian passport have qualified for Paris 2024 but said that the final number of athletes who will actually compete at the Games would not be communicated until the selection process has been finalized. \u201cThe maximum number, which is unlikely to be reached, would be 55 and 28 respectively,\u201d the IOC told CNN. In comparison, Russia sent 330 athletes to Tokyo in 2021 while Belarus sent 104. There is also the matter of whether Moscow will actually accept the conditions laid out by the IOC. Russia is planning to host its own \u201cFriendship Games\u201d later in the year, an event which has been condemned by the IOC. The identity of the athletes is also yet to be revealed, but it is possible that Russian former world No. 1 tennis player Daniil Medvedev will be part of the field. The former US Open champion said that he would be happy to participate as a neutral. \u201cI decided for myself that whenever I can play the Olympics, I want to be there I want to represent what I can represent,\u201d he told reporters last month. \u201cIf it\u2019s not under the flag, I know who I am, I know why I play tennis and I played like this all my life. Russia has competed under a neutral banner on two previous occasions. The ROC was suspended in 2017 as a result of the doping scandal ahead of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea the following year, but selected Russian athletes who met pre-competition conditions were still given the opportunity to compete as \u201cOlympic Athletes from Russia\u201d and were represented by the Olympic flag. Russia and Belarus were also part of the \u201cUnified Team\u201d at the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona after the dissolution of the Soviet Union the previous year. The delegation was made up of former Soviet republics \u2013 aside from the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia \u2013 which had elected to compete as one unit. The Unified Team also bore the Olympic flag but winners were honored under the flags of their own nations.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/sport/individual-neutral-athlete-olympics-explainer-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2023_10_30_sport_enhanced-games-olympics-doping-spt-intl", "text": "The 2024 Olympics are fast approaching and as athletes gear up for one of the world\u2019s most prestigious sporting events, one entrepreneur has a different idea of what \u201cfaster, higher, stronger\u201d \u2013 the former motto of the Games \u2013 might represent. The Enhanced Games says it is an \u201calternative\u201d to what it calls the \u201ccorrupt Olympics Games.\u201d Athletes competing at the Enhanced Games will be free to use performance-enhancing drugs, they won\u2019t be tested and will be under no obligation to declare which substances they have taken in order to compete. That\u2019s quite a contrast to the Olympics\u2019 doping protocols. The International Testing Agency (ITA) will be responsible for looking after Paris 2024\u2019s anti-doping program. Six years ago, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which oversees the Olympics, delegated its entire clean sport program to the ITA. However, historically the Olympic Games have been dogged by a series of doping and kickback scandals. When approached for comment on the Enhanced Games and allegations of corruption, the IOC told CNN Sport that \u201cthe idea does not merit any comment.\u201d \u2018Danger to health, to sport\u2019 CNN Sport interviewed a number of experts in the field of doping for this story, who expressed concern that the Enhanced Games was an extremely dangerous proposition. Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, who exposed Russia\u2019s state-sponsored doping program \u2013 a massive, years-long effort which benefited more than 1,000 athletes between 2011 and 2015 \u2013 said that the Enhanced Games is a \u201cdanger to health, to sport.\u201d Whether the Enhanced Games will ever take place remains an open question, but the very idea is drawing considerable blowback from leading anti-doping officials and sporting organizations. The Enhanced Games is the brainchild of businessman Aron D\u2019Souza. He is also the founding editor of \u201cThe Journal Jurisprudence,\u201d a quarterly publication on legal philosophy, according to his website, which also describes him as an \u201cavid athlete.\u201d Recently, D\u2019Souza told CNN Sport he has \u201csigned term sheets with prominent venture capital firms\u201d in relation to the Enhanced Games and is \u201cwaiting on the lawyers to finish long-form drafting.\u201d He also said that a funding announcement is planned for early December. Although not legally binding, term sheets are a serious expression of intent by both sides, setting out the broad principles of an agreement. D\u2019Souza believes what he calls a \u201cscience-driven\u201d competition is the next step in the evolution of sport, suggesting that the absence of drug testing will level the playing field. According to a 2020 study from Raphael Faiss, Research Manager at the centre of Research and Expertise in anti-doping sciences at the University of Lausanne, data from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) suggests less than 2% of athletes dope. However, Faiss told CNN Sport the number of athletes taking performance-enhancing drugs is likely significantly higher; his research, based on two international major athletic events in 2011 and 2013, suggests the figure could be between 15 to 18%. Faiss and his team compared athletes\u2019 blood results collected by WADA-accredited labs to values from healthy adults, as well as doped and undoped athletes; the closer the values are to those of subjects to whom erythropoietin (EPO, which is used in blood doping) had been administered, the higher the chances that they\u2019re actually doping. This analysis, Faiss said, is not proof of doping, but is a \u201crobust way\u201d of analyzing the data, allowing scientists to make an estimate for doping prevalence, as well as targeting athletes most likely to be doping. In written comments to CNN Sport, WADA said: \u201cDetermining the level of [doping] prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed,\u201d explaining that, since 2017, a \u201cprevalence working group\u201d has been established to \u201cdetermine if strategies, reliable methods and tools can be developed to adequately assess the prevalence of doping in sports.\u201d WADA told CNN Sport that the group has delivered \u201cseveral recommendations and guidance to WADA but not the final ones yet.\u201d WADA has reservations about Faiss\u2019 study and pointed to the \u201ccomplexity of trying to measure [doping] prevalence,\u201d highlighting that reports have \u201cgreatly varying results.\u201d The anti-doping organization added: \u201cNo single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline.\u201d \u201cComparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system\u2019s testing figures isn\u2019t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence. \u201cIn any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries \u2013 it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others. \u201cThe Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures.\u201d Editor\u2019s note: You can find WADA\u2019s full statement at the bottom of this article.\u00a0 \u2018A dangerous clown show\u2019 Travis Tygart, the Chief Executive Officer at the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), told CNN Sport that the idea of an Enhanced Games is \u201cfarcical \u2026 likely illegal in many [US] states\u201d and \u201ca dangerous clown show, not real sport.\u201d Substances such as anabolic steroids \u2013 which help to build muscle mass by enabling athletes to train harder and recover quickly from strenuous workouts \u2013 are classified as a Schedule III drug by the US Drug Enforcement Administration. When asked whether anabolic steroids will be allowed at the games and whether athletes would be tested for illegal drugs such as cocaine, D\u2019Souza told CNN Sport that \u201cwe will not be drug testing at the games.\u201d He added: \u201cWe do not propose to regulate what athletes use.\u201d Anabolic steroids may be prescribed by a licensed physician for the treatment of certain conditions such as testosterone deficiency, but if used in the US without a prescription from a licensed physician, a first conviction could result in a one-year prison sentence and a $1,000 fine. But that isn\u2019t the only potential legal jeopardy the Enhanced Games faces, according to American lawyer Jim Walden, who represents Russian whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov. \u201cIf you look at the Enhanced Games website, it\u2019s almost as though they\u2019re advertising their disregard of the law,\u201d Walden told CNN Sport. \u201cThey wrap themselves up in what I will call the cloak of legitimacy by using phrases like body autonomy and coming out as an enhanced athlete. \u201cI hope they\u2019re thinking hard about how they\u2019re going to pull this off in the world in which the FBI has a specific unit that is called the Sports and Gaming Initiative that\u2019s focusing on these very issues.\u201d The Sports and Gaming Initiative was developed to \u201cprotect athletes and sporting institutions in the United States from criminal threats and influences,\u201d according to the government website. The initiative works in partnership with sports leagues and governing bodies, international law enforcement and independent watchdog groups to tackle crimes such as fraud, doping and match-fixing; criminal activities, it says, \u201cdegrade the integrity of sports and competition and erode public confidence in these cherished institutions.\u201d \u201cThe use of doping substances is not acceptable in modern sports,\u201d Rodchenkov said in his written comments to CNN. \u201cPromotion and advertising of banned substances is against sport rules and moral, letter and spirit. \u201cIt might bring an extreme harm to young generation[s] of athletes who mistakenly could believe in benefits of [the] Enhanced Games.\u201d Rodchenkov, the protagonist of the Oscar-winning Netflix documentary Icarus who is currently under FBI protection, also believes that the Enhanced Games\u2019 organizers \u201cmight get investigated [\u2026] under the Rodchenkov Act.\u201d The Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act, named after the whistleblower, allows the US to impose criminal sanctions on individuals involved in doping activities at international events. However, the Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act does not apply to sporting events that don\u2019t adopt the WADA code, which the Enhanced Games wouldn\u2019t do. Rodchenkov also added that WADA athletes could not have any affiliation or contact with so-called enhanced athletes, or they would risk being charged under Article 2.10 \u2013 \u201cProhibited Association by an Athlete or Other Person\u201d \u2013 of the World Anti-Doping Code. USADA\u2019s Tygart also told CNN Sport: \u201cNo one really wants our children growing up idolizing unbridled drug use in sport, even if some profiteers think otherwise.\u201d D\u2019Souza insists his motivation for founding the Enhanced Games isn\u2019t financial. If he had wanted to make more money, he says he\u2019d continue to be a \u201cquiet, mild-mannered venture capitalist.\u201d \u201cI do think fundamentally that consumers want this [the Enhanced Games] and athletes want this because if you go to the cinemas, no one\u2019s interested in histories in the past anymore,\u201d said D\u2019Souza. \u201cThey\u2019re interested in superheroes and technology in the future. And this is literally what we are bringing to a reality.\u201d \u2018The dirtiest Olympics in history\u2019 According to Pierre de Coubertin \u2013 the founder of the modern Olympics \u2013 \u201cfor every man, woman and child, it [sport] offers an opportunity for self-improvement.\u201d Except historically, many athletes competing in the Olympics have taken the idea of self-improvement too far, notably at London 2012, which Rodchenkov has previously called \u201cthe dirtiest Olympics in history.\u201d When the ITA concluded its re-analysis program for the London Games, it found 73 anti-doping rule violations, which led to the withdrawal of 31 medals and reallocation of 46 Olympic medals across the sports of athletics, weightlifting, wrestling and canoeing. Doping has been an issue at the Olympics throughout the event\u2019s history, and the 100-meter final at the 1988 Games has become one of the most infamous and controversial moments in sporting history. Six of the eight finalists \u2013 notably the winner, Ben Johnson \u2013 who lined up on that September day in Seoul 35 years ago would fail drug tests themselves or be implicated in drug use during their careers. Despite some athletes continuing to cheat, global antidoping efforts remain ever-present, according to the testers. Recent out-of-competition (OOC) testing data published by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) highlights positive results from steps being taken to keep \u201celite podiums and finals clean,\u201d according to the anti-doping organization. Data focused on OOC testing ahead of last year\u2019s World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon, shows how resources and testing are targeting those athletes most likely to win medals and make finals. Whilst only 39% of the athletes in Eugene had three or more OOC tests in the 10 months leading up the event, 81% of top-eight finishers had three or more OOC tests. Yet the cat and mouse game between testers and athletes using banned substances continues. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly about the question of timing and targeting the right athletes,\u201d said Faiss. Given that athletes have their blood values regularly monitored, it is \u201cgetting more difficult for athletes to use high doses [of drugs such as EPO], but they would still be using micro dosing.\u201d By taking EPO late at night and drinking enough water, the substance would not be detected in athletes the following morning, according to Faiss, though athletes suspected of blood doping could be tested in the middle of the night. \u201cAthletes are actually getting back to very simple ways of doping with steroids,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cEPO is quite simple to use, but still tricky to detect.\u201d Athletes \u201cuse the drugs that are actively working.\u201d When it comes to new substances such as Roxadustat \u2013 the drug that two-time grand slam champion Simona Halep has recently been given a four-year ban for taking, although she denies ever knowingly or intentionally taking any prohibited substance \u2013 Faiss said athletes \u201care likely to use substances with a very short half-life in [the] body that are mimicking processes of the oxygen carrying improvements through the EPO channels.\u201d Roxadustat has an elimination half-life of 10-16 hours, according to the National Institutes of Health. Athletes are \u201cseeking to find substances where the [half-life] time window is very short, to make sure that if they are not tested at the right moment, they won\u2019t be caught,\u201d said Faiss. \u2018Challenge for sporting competition\u2019 Michele Verroken, the founding director of consultancy group Sporting Integrity, believes an antidoping system is required that will \u201cgive a lot more credibility, a lot more immediacy to verifying results, if we\u2019re going to keep the hearts and minds of athletes.\u201d Verroken also questions what\u2019s stopping an athlete from cheating if they only get caught 10 years after the event, or not at all. Under the World Anti-Doping Code, there is a 10-year statute of limitations on samples taken from 2015 onwards. Verroken told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games is \u201csetting a really interesting challenge for sporting competition.\u201d Not unsurprisingly, many sporting bodies have condemned the event. The Australian Olympic Committee called it \u201cdangerous and irresponsible,\u201d saying that \u201cthe world needs better than this.\u201d UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) said it \u201cis extremely concerned by the concept of an Enhanced Games,\u201d adding that \u201cthere is no place in sport for performance enhancing drugs, nor the Enhanced Games.\u201d UKAD\u2019s Director of Operations, Hamish Coffey, told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games sets a \u201chugely dangerous precedent,\u201d expressing concern over the kind of messaging the event sends to the next generation of athletes. \u2018Very accomplished athletes\u2019 When CNN Sport spoke to D\u2019Souza shortly after the proposed event\u2019s announcement, he said that 368 athletes had enquired about the Enhanced Games and more had messaged via social media. The organization\u2019s Chief Athletes Officer and former Olympian Brett Fraser, who swam for the Cayman Islands at three Olympic Games, told CNN Sport that \u201cvery accomplished athletes\u201d at the level of Olympic finalists have reached out \u201cto understand more about how the first Games will take place and how they can become involved.\u201d Fraser added that Enhanced Games organizers \u201calready have an Olympic medallist\u201d for their athlete commission, though he didn\u2019t specify who that was. He also said there has been \u201ca lot of positive feedback and a lot of acceptance and excitement from younger generations.\u201d Nonetheless, none of the athletes appear prepared to speak publicly at this stage. For those who do want to compete, the Enhanced Games would be an annual event with five categories \u2013 track and field, swimming, weightlifting, gymnastics and martial arts. The huge cost of hosting an Olympic Games is no secret, with countries often striving to create bigger and better spectacles by blowing their budget. Tokyo 2021 had the largest Olympic sports program in history, with 33 sports competitions in 42 venues culminating in 339 medal events. The Covid-impacted Games were delivered with a final expenditure of $13 billion \u2013 almost double the $7.3 billion that was originally forecast. Meanwhile, keeping the IOC\u2019s philosophy of \u201clower-impact Games\u201d in mind, 95% of venues will be pre-existing facilities at the Paris 2024 Olympics. D\u2019Souza said the Enhanced Games will focus on fewer sports, reuse existing infrastructure and fund the event through the private sector to \u201cdeliver a high-impact yet cost-efficient games\u201d so profits can be shared with the athletes. He added that the Enhanced Games is looking for a seven-figure prize pool for any athlete potentially breaking Usain Bolt\u2019s 100-meter world record of 9.58 seconds. \u201cI\u2019ve had conversations with people who are top-10 sprinters in the world who are going to the next Olympics, and they said [\u2026] if there\u2019s a million-dollar prize to break the 100m world record, I\u2019ll be there,\u201d said D\u2019Souza. Universal basic income and mental health support to athletes will also be part of an \u201cenhanced athletes programme.\u201d When asked who would take responsibility if an athlete competing at the Enhanced Games were to suffer fatal consequences, D\u2019Souza told CNN Sport that \u201cour athletes at the games will be the most monitored athletes in history.\u201d He said: \u201cWe will focus on athlete safety by mandating athletes have pre-competition full-system clinical screenings including blood tests and EKGs.\u201d \u201cThis will ensure that athletes are healthy to complete and not at risk of major health complications.\u201d D\u2019Souza also said that athletes will sign waivers in order\u00a0to compete. As it stands, no venues are officially in place to host the event and D\u2019Souza admits its scale will be dependent on funding and media partnerships. \u201cWe\u2019re in commercial negotiations with venues and media partners at the moment,\u201d added D\u2019Souza, who said the first Enhanced Games will be at a university campus or a similar facility in the south of the US and that a number of trademarks have been filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. \u2018Undermine the very purpose of sport\u2019 Elite performance coach Trevor Painter, who has worked with a number of Olympic and international sprinters and middle-distance runners, said he would \u201cnever\u201d coach an athlete taking performance-enhancing drugs because it would go against his morals as a coach. \u201cHaving been involved with many athletes that have lost in many ways to the cheats, I won\u2019t be engaging with [the Enhanced Games],\u201d Painter told CNN Sport. If it goes ahead as planned in December 2024, D\u2019Souza insists that the Enhanced Games will unlock the potential of humanity. But according to John William Devine, Senior Lecturer in Ethics, Sport and Exercise Sciences at Swansea University in Wales, the Enhanced Games will make sporting competition more unfair than it already is and even \u201cundermine the very purpose of the sport in question.\u201d Devine told CNN Sport that \u201cperformance-enhancing drugs don\u2019t actually lead to better athletic performance. They obscure athletic performance.\u201d He added that, although the Enhanced Games may look very similar to the Olympics, the nature of the activity will be different, raising the question: \u201cTo what extent is drug-assisted performance reflective of the athletes\u2019 sporting excellence?\u201d WADA response in full: Determining the level of prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed. That is why we set up a\u00a0Working Group on Doping Prevalence\u00a0in 2017. Measuring doping prevalence is a difficult and complex process. Through its work, the group found a huge variance across the many prevalence studies that have been carried out, leading it to publish guidelines on how to improve the quality of measuring prevalence. WADA is currently developing a tool that Anti-Doping Organizations can use to evaluate the effectiveness of their programs. WADA is well aware of the [Faiss] study. Indeed, one of the contributors, Prof. Martial Saugy, is a member of the Working Group. This study is one of many that helps to inform the Group\u2019s work. It is a very narrow study. It looks at two events, in a single sport, held 10 and 12 years ago, using just one method of measurement (the Athlete Biological Passport (ABP)). As far as I am aware, there is no comparable data from more recent World Championships in the same sport. Given its limited scope, it is important that this study be analyzed within the wider context of other studies and not be taken in isolation. This study also highlights the complexity of trying to measure prevalence. It is the third published paper that sought to measure prevalence at the 2011 Athletics World Championships. Each reported greatly varying results. The fact is no single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline. Results will always come with caveats and margins of error and will be based on a variety of methods, including self-report questionnaires, analytical methods (like ABP and testing data) and other methods to give a more rounded estimate of what the most likely figure would be. Comparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system\u2019s testing figures isn\u2019t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence. In any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries \u2013 it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others. The Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/10/30/sport/enhanced-games-olympics-doping-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_04_29_sport_caledonian-braves-american-investors-scotland-spt-intl", "text": "Soccer is becoming firmly entrenched in mainstream pop culture with hit television shows like\u00a0\u201cTed Lasso\u201d and \u201cWelcome to Wrexham,\u201d the documentary series\u00a0detailing Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney\u2019s ownership of the Welsh soccer club, introducing the sport to new audiences in the US and abroad \u2013 as Chris Ewing is quickly discovering. On any given evening, Ewing receives emails informing him that some fan in a far-flung location \u2013 say, Los Angeles \u2013 has just invested in his tiny Scottish soccer club, the Caledonian Braves. \u201cThen 10 minutes later, there would be someone from Australia invest in the club and it\u2019s just like, \u2018Wow, I can\u2019t believe it,\u2019\u201d Ewing, the club\u2019s founder, tells CNN Sport. Nestled in the leafy outskirts of Motherwell, a town about 20 kilometers southeast of Glasgow, the Caledonian Braves play in the Scottish fifth division with a team of mostly amateur players at a ground with capacity for just 500 fans. But, despite its small home, Ewing\u2019s vision of creating a fan-owned club, steeped in values of diversity and community with ambitions of reaching the Scottish Premier League, has attracted more than $300,000 in investment from more than 1,000 owners around the world, far outstripping the annual running costs of about $58,000, he says. Among those owners include an NBA player, an NBA coach and a\u00a0players\u2019 union executive\u00a0as well as soccer players in the US\u2019 National Women Super League (NWSL). Investors in 49 US states have bought in \u2013 Wyoming is the only state pending on the list, he says. \u201cA community club, most people would think, is a local community bound by a certain geography,\u201d says Ewing. \u201cBut I think that today when we have internet, we have social media, we have an app as well that promotes fan engagement, I feel like a community can be just shared ideals and shared values, and it can be global.\u201d \u2018Entrepreneurial spirit\u2019 Visiting Scotland and learning about the country\u2019s history was an \u201camazing\u201d experience for Mujtaba Elgoodah, one of the club\u2019s lead investors, he remembers. More used to basketball than soccer, Elgoodah was the manager of team development for the Golden State Warriors when they won the 2022 NBA title and is now part of the National Basketball Players\u2019 Association executive leadership team. But, when braving the bitterly cold Scottish weather to visit the club in February, he discovered \u201cthere is nothing like a good football match,\u201d Elgoodah tells CNN Sport. \u201cJust seeing the intensity and even picking up different slang words that the crowd was throwing out there was amazing too,\u201d he adds. Elgoodah had been intrigued by the Braves\u2019 story and ethos when he happened across their story on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, last year. He set about assembling a group of investors who could appreciate both soccer\u2019s potential for growth and the importance of community alongside his longtime investment partner Nassir Criss, a serial entrepreneur and venture capitalist. Together, they involved NWSL\u2019s Kansas City Current stars Elizabeth Ball, Kristen Hamilton and Hailie Mace with their wealth of soccer knowledge, and introduced Boston Celtics performance coach Isaiah Covington to Ewing after he had also noticed the club\u2019s story on social media. \u201cI didn\u2019t grow up around soccer,\u201d Covington recalls. \u201cBut in the last few years, I have a host of nieces and nephews and that\u2019s all they play now.\u201d Though still nowhere near as popular as American football or basketball, soccer is the fastest-growing sport in the US and the most popular choice for adults under the age of 30. As a high school sport alone, it has grown by almost 300% in the last 40 years. \u201cYou see \u2026 all these celebrities owning football clubs, it\u2019s kind of the new wave that people are on,\u201d Hamilton says. \u201cAnd so I think that that\u2019s been a really huge, powerful movement in the US saying, \u2018Hey, you know, we can\u2019t own an NFL team, but we can own a small football team.\u2019\u201d With its idea for lots of small investors helping it achieve huge ambitions, the Braves embodies an American style \u201centrepreneurial spirit,\u201d Criss tells CNN Sport. \u201cHow do we take something new that no one\u2019s ever really heard of, this wee club with massive ambitions to being a global franchise and pour in resources, community, people to actually accelerate that on a very big scale,\u201d he says. \u2018Flipping the narrative\u2019 As more and more money pours into soccer, the gap between fans and owners has become a cavern at many clubs. In the battle for soccer\u2019s soul, the two groups are often pitted against each other \u2013 the fans as representing the history and traditions of the sport, the owners cast as turning clubs into commercial entities or vehicles for sportswashing. Against this backdrop, fan ownership has emerged as somewhat of a utopian panacea for some fans. While it is still an unusual model in the UK, particularly in the English Premier League and Championship where clubs operate at huge losses, the Braves are not the first to pursue this goal. They were set up as a company limited by shares in 2022 meaning that fans can buy into it, and expect to file their first set of accounts in October.\u00a0Ewing founded a previous attempt at this ownership model from 2019 to 2021 but dissolved it before ever trading, he says. In Scotland, fans have become majority owners at topflight clubs St Mirren, Motherwell and Heart of Midlothian in recent years while several others, including Rangers and Celtic, count fans among their minority owners. In German soccer culture, meanwhile, the 50+1 concept of fan majority ownership is deeply entrenched thereby giving fans more of a say in the running of clubs, a model Ewing says he hopes to eventually emulate. But fan ownership isn\u2019t easy, namely working out how to marshal hundreds of opinions into some sort of coherent opinion. Ewing, who doesn\u2019t take a salary from the club, admits that managing expectations has proved challenging \u201cbecause people think they can just say, okay, let\u2019s do x, y, z.\u201d \u201cWith the best intentions in the world, it\u2019s maybe not as easy as that, but I think as well, the big thing for me is that people get to love the highs and the lows.\u201d The Braves have an app and Discord channel, helping to foster this sense of community and allowing fan owners to have a voice on the direction of the club. Fans picked the club\u2019s name, logo and the name of its ground \u2013 Alliance Park. Allowing fans this ownership over the team is proving infectious, its investors are finding. \u201cAnytime I ever post about the Braves \u2026 people will DM me and be like, \u201c\u2019Who\u2019s this team \u2026 and how do I get involved?\u2019\u201d Ball says. Such a project is a marked difference from Ewing\u2019s original venture, Edusport Academy, which he established in 2011, intending to provide a place for promising young soccer players, mostly from France, to hone their craft and learn English. As time went by, the academy\u2019s first team started playing in the Scottish soccer leagues and separated to form the Caledonian Braves in 2019. Now, as the Braves continue to grow, it has set its sights on rising up through the leagues but in a sustainable way that preserves the club for years to come. \u201c(We\u2019re) flipping the narrative that you don\u2019t have to be Tom Brady or Matthew McConaughey or Ryan Reynolds,\u201d says Ewing. \u201cYou can be anyone really from anywhere and you can also own a football club for as little as $100.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/29/sport/caledonian-braves-american-investors-scotland-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2023_09_20_sport_saudi-arabia-soccer-spl-bin-salman-intl-spt-cmd-dg", "text": "When Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal reportedly planned a $1.1 billion bid to sign French soccer superstar Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 \u2013 including $332 million to his club, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), and an eye-watering $775 million salary packet to the World Cup winner for just one year \u2013 it was slammed by critics as sportswashing. Mbapp\u00e9 might have said no to the offer in July, but a month later, Neymar Jr. said yes to Al-Hilal, as the Brazil star moved from PSG for a transfer fee of around $98.5 million (\u20ac90 million) plus add-ons, according to multiple reports. In a record-breaking transfer window, Saudi Pro League (SPL) clubs spent close to $1 billion, acquiring 94 overseas players from Europe\u2019s major leagues \u2013 France\u2019s Ligue 1, Spain\u2019s La Liga, Italy\u2019s Serie A, Germany\u2019s Bundesliga and the English Premier League \u2013 according to Deloitte. Despite the Arab nation\u2019s poor human rights record, Saudi Arabia\u2019s spending spree to turn its domestic soccer league into a star-studded, bona fide competition shows the seriousness of its ambition. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman says he doesn\u2019t \u201ccare\u201d about the country\u2019s investment in sport being described as sportswashing. \u201cWell if sportswashing is going to increase my GDP by one percent, then I will continue doing sportswashing,\u201d MBS said in an\u00a0interview\u00a0with Fox News which aired Wednesday. Pressed on if he was bothered by the use of the term, MBS continued: \u201cI don\u2019t care. I have one percent GDP growth from sport, and I am aiming for another one and a half percent. Call it whatever you want, we\u2019re going to get that one and a half percent.\u201d Saudi clubs, several of which have been taken over by the nation\u2019s sovereign Public Investment Fund (PIF), have already attracted some of the biggest names in the sport. By attracting some of the world\u2019s biggest stars to the Gulf states, the SPL wants \u201cto drive competitiveness on and off the pitch,\u201d though it\u2019s keen to emphasize that these overseas players will help develop \u201cyoung Saudi talent.\u201d During this summer transfer window, the government-controlled PIF increased the cumulative value of these four clubs nearly five times, making them the most valuable in the country, according to estimates by the sports website Transfermarkt. Plenty of other leading stars have eagerly said yes to the SPL, notably 2022 Ballon D\u2019Or winner Karim Benzema joining Al-Ittihad at the end of his contract with Spanish soccer giant Real Madrid. As the European transfer window came to a close, the four PIF-owned teams have spent nearly $900 million (\u20ac835.1 million) on buying elite international players, Transfermarkt data shows, which ranked them in the top 20 clubs in the world by transfer expenditure, alongside soccer giants from England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy. Al Hilal alone paid more than $378 million (\u20ac353 million), more than PSG and Arsenal, making it the second-largest spender this year. The newly acquired players join five-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, who has a two-year contract with Al-Nassr where he will earn a staggering estimated $200 million a year, according to Saudi state-owned media, currently making him the world\u2019s highest paid soccer player. As of today, 21 of the most expensive soccer players in Saudi Arabia by transfer fees \u2013 all international stars \u2013 play for one of the PIF-owned clubs. Despite the financial outlay, the SPL is remaining deliberately tight-lipped about the specifics of its financial gamble, with chief operating officer Carlo Nohra confirming to CNN Sport that it was \u201cnot in [the SPL\u2019s] competitive advantage\u201d to report the salaries offered to players and coaches. The PIF has $777 billion in assets under management, according to its most recent filing, with ambitions to top $1 trillion within a few years. In 2021, it acquired English soccer club Newcastle United, before focusing on investments at home. The club is now also among top spenders on players. Saudi clubs not owned by the PIF are also splurging on big-ticket players, with former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson, 33, offered an eye-watering salary of $870,000 (\u00a3700,000) per week, according to multiple reports, in an estimated $15 million (\u00a312 million) transfer from Liverpool to Saudi team Al-Ettifaq. In a recent interview with The Athletic, Henderson said those numbers \u201cjust aren\u2019t true.\u201d \u201cEssentially, the signal is \u2018We mean business,\u2019\u201d Simon Chadwick, a professor of sport and geopolitical economy at SKEMA Business School, told CNN.\u201cWe\u2019ve got so much money that for a player who is \u2026 coming towards the end of his career, we can afford to pay him 700,000 [GB pounds a week], or whatever it is that he\u2019s being paid, and still have Cristiano Ronaldo and still be in the market for other players as well,\u201d Chadwick said, describing Saudi\u2019s approach to becoming a sporting superpower, adding that the sky is the limit in terms of cost. Saudi\u2019s love of soccer Saudi Arabia follows in the footsteps of several other countries \u2013 including China and Qatar in investing large sums of money to try and turn themselves into soccer powerhouses. It remains to be seen whether Saudi\u2019s turbocharged investment will have a lasting impact or resemble something like a costly rebranding effort. The Saudi national team has been to multiple World Cups, and the country\u2019s clubs have won multiple Asian titles. Saudi\u2019s victory over Argentina during last year\u2019s men\u2019s World Cup was hailed as one of the greatest upsets in tournament history, with the country\u2019s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud granting a national public holiday in recognition of the win. Club games can attract huge crowds in the Middle Eastern nation. \u201cFor example, Al-Ittihad against Al-Hilal, you\u2019re talking about drawing crowds of 40, 50, 60,000 people, these are games that are comparable in size to Chelsea vs. Arsenal, Manchester United vs. Manchester City,\u201d Chadwick said. Buying star players, some arguably past their prime, also provides an easy win for Saudi teams, according to Kieran Maguire, co-host of \u201cThe Price of Football\u201d podcast. \u201cFrom the Saudi authorities\u2019 point of view, they\u2019re getting a ready-made product. Everybody\u2019s heard of Benzema. Everybody\u2019s heard of Cristiano Ronaldo and so on,\u201d Maguire said. Saudi Arabia\u2019s lofty sporting ambitions don\u2019t end with the SPL or Newcastle United. The country is hosting the 2023 FIFA Club World Cup and is bidding to host the 2027 AFC Asian Cup. Several media reports also indicated that the Gulf kingdom was considering launching a bid for the 2030 FIFA men\u2019s World Cup alongside Greece and Egypt \u2013 although it is reportedly mulling pulling its candidacy. Meanwhile, the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) has agreed to a contract that will see the Spanish Super Cup played in Saudi Arabia until 2029, a deal that will earn the Spanish governing body between \u20ac35-45 million ($38-48 million) a year. Appealing to the youth Saudi Arabia has a very young population: the country\u2019s most recent census revealed 32.2 million people live in the country, nearly 42% of whom are foreign nationals \u2013 and 51% of the Saudi population are under the age of 30.\u202fOf this populace, Saudi authorities say that over 80% play, attend or follow soccer, the national sport. Chadwick explains that Saudi Arabia\u2019s government is concerned with the prospect of its younger members of society becoming radicalized or an anti-government sentiment bubbling up like that of the Arab Spring \u2013 and looks to offer its population a thriving soccer industry to keep it placated. Though the soccer industry generates employment, revenues, export earnings and inward investment, \u201cwhat is just as significant is the security of the royal family,\u201d Chadwick adds. The Arab Spring, a wave of pro-democracy protests that washed over the Middle East and North Africa in 2011, achieved mixed results. Four Arab dictators in Libya, Yemen, Egypt and Tunisia were toppled, offering a brief sense of victory for protesters, but, since then, new wars have prompted a retreat of popular movements in the region. Meanwhile, failed uprisings in Bahrain and eastern Saudi Arabia were followed by years-long crackdowns and a continuing civil war in Syria. \u201cWhat we\u2019re beginning to see in Saudi Arabia right now is the emergence of a new social contract. And the social contract essentially is catering for the needs of the Gen Z population,\u201d Chadwick said. \u201cYou want Ronaldo? You got him. You want some of the best football teams in the world? You got them. You want the World Cup to come to Saudi Arabia? You got it \u2026 But don\u2019t question us,\u201d Chadwick explained. Maguire agrees, noting that investing in soccer \u201ccan be seen as part of a much broader socio-economic plan, run by the Saudi authorities.\u201d At the same time, there has been \u201ca significant increase in the number of Saudi Arabians detained by the authorities, for example, for posting adverse comments on social media about the country\u201d this year, Chadwick told CNN. Human rights group Amnesty International told CNN that it has documented a rollback in human rights in Saudi Arabia, including an escalating crackdown on freedom of expression and an increased use of counterterrorism and cybercrime laws to silence dissent. Between 2022 and 2023, the organization said it has documented an increase in criminal prosecutions compared to previous years. In 2022, Amnesty reported the highest number of annual executions in the country in 30 years, with 196 people killed. \u201cReputation is important in terms of attracting foreign investment, and \u2026 Mohammed bin Salman, as much as he has significant financial muscle, needs foreign investing for the realization of his diversification,\u201d James Dorsey, the author of the syndicated column and blog, \u201cThe Turbulent World of Middle East Soccer,\u201d explains. Saudi Arabia is the world\u2019s biggest exporter of crude oil, and nearly two-thirds of its income still comes from selling fossil fuels. But with oil prices regularly dipping below what the Gulf state needs to balance its budget, it has focused efforts on trying to bring in investment from abroad along with its efforts to raise oil prices. Projections indicate the kingdom has around 20 years to diversify its economy to ensure it is more resilient, according to Chadwick \u2013 not least to fund its Vision 2030 projects, including the $500 billion Neom city, a 106 mile-long linear city called The Line and a futuristic plan to revamp the capital. \u201cPart of the grand vision of Mohammed bin Salman, looking forward to 2030, he does have his desire to make Saudi Arabia less dependent on natural resources to look at a post-fuel economy [involving] tourism, entertainment. If Saudi Arabia can become a hub for major sporting events, then that\u2019s a way of attracting interest to the country,\u201d said Maguire. CNN has reached out to the Saudi Ministry of Sport for comment on allegations that the kingdom has been rolling back human rights, and investing in soccer as a way of \u201csportswashing\u201d its image. In response to previous criticism about Saudi Arabia\u2019s purported \u201csportswashing,\u201d the kingdom\u2019s sports minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal said: \u201cPeople that don\u2019t know Saudi Arabia, have never been to Saudi Arabia, go out and talk about it as if they\u2019ve lived there for 30 years, 40 years. So I always tell people, come to Saudi. Come and see Saudi. \u201cSee what it is, see the people, meet the people. Look at what the country is doing for the future of the people in Saudi, then you can criticize as much as you like,\u201d he added. Lack of transparency: Saudi threatens new systems of governance\u202fin sports Saudi Arabia has already disrupted the golf industry and, with soccer, Maguire told CNN, \u201cthey feel that they can do that probably on a smaller scale, but perhaps, ultimately, to generate more interest in terms of eyeballs if they go down the same route.\u201d In 2021, the Saudi government-controlled PIF bankrolled LIV Golf, reportedly at a cost of $2 billion, attracting many of the sport\u2019s top players away from the US-based PGA Tour and Europe-based DP World Tour by offering big dollar prize money, with PGA Tour board member Jimmy Dunne raising fears that they might end up \u201cowning golf.\u201d Earlier this year, the US-based PGA Tour announced it was set to partner with the Saudi-backed breakaway LIV Golf, ending a feud that has dogged the men\u2019s professional game for the past year, with Dunne warning that sport\u2019s governing body had no choice but to reach the truce to retain some measure of control. \u201cThey have an unlimited horizon and an unlimited amount of money,\u201d he said at a contentious Senate hearing on the truce between the two tours. When it comes to soccer, Aleksander Ceferin, president of European football\u2019s governing body UEFA, has dismissed the competitive threat that the SPL could pose. \u201cAs far as I know, Mbappe and [Erling] Haaland don\u2019t dream of Saudi Arabia. I don\u2019t believe that the best players at the pinnacle of their careers would go to Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said last month. \u201cWhen people talk to me about the players who went there, nobody knows where they\u2019re playing.\u201d Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp took a different view, referring to the fact that the Saudi summer transfer window stays open after European clubs see theirs close: \u201cI don\u2019t know how stable it is and I think the next two weeks will show how much of a challenge it is because whatever happens there, no one can react anymore. \u201cI don\u2019t know where it will lead to but it feels rather like a threat or a concern than not because I can\u2019t see how we really deny it in these moments, what can we do?\u201d he added. Still, the new SPL director of football, Michael Emenalo, says what Saudi soccer is doing is \u201cno different from what the Premier League have done.\u201d \u201cThere was a time when it was all about Italy. There was a time when it was all about Spain. What we\u2019re looking for in the industry is an opportunity to compete, and to compete on an even scale and to improve upon whatever exists in the industry,\u201d said Emenalo in a press release sent to CNN. New Saudi Pro League Chief Operating Officer Carlo Nohra told CNN that there is logic behind the league\u2019s strategy of money is no object to lure international stars. \u201cWe can\u2019t expect to be paying market value to entice people to come here at this early stage in our development.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0But analysts say that the difference lies in the level of transparency, which \u201csimply doesn\u2019t exist in Saudi Arabia,\u201d Chadwick explained to CNN. European soccer governing body UEFA has financial fair play (FFP) rules on teams\u2019 spending, while Major League Soccer in the US has a salary cap for its clubs. Nohra told CNN that, eventually, the country wants 0.3% of its GDP to be from soccer to make it similar to that of the Premier League on the UK economy \u2013 up from its current value of \u201c0.000 something.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve got no chance to get into that figure at present,\u201d Maguire explained, but added that the SPL could perhaps move into the top 10 of the world\u2019s domestic leagues. \u201cThat is feasible given the amount of money that they\u2019re spending.\u201d \u201cI think they\u2019re realistic. They don\u2019t say that they\u2019re going to overtake La Liga or the Premier League or the major European leagues,\u201d Maguire said. When the Peterson Institute for International Economics compared the world\u2019s sovereign wealth funds on criteria including governance, transparency and accountability in 2019, the PIF scored well below average on a measure combining these criteria, and ranked in the bottom 10 out of 64 funds, just above Russian Direct Investment Fund. CNN has reached out to the PIF for further comment about its investments in sport, particularly soccer and golf, and criticisms about its lack of transparency. Chadwick raised concerns over how a lack of financial rules affecting Saudi clubs might dilute UEFA\u2019s FFP regulations, as well as those of the Premier League, or impact world soccer governing body FIFA\u2019s systems of governance. The lack of transparency in Saudi Arabia\u2019s wealth fund has already raised suspicions in the US golfing and political spheres. Earlier this summer, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations launched an inquiry about the PGA Tour\u2019s agreement with the PIF-controlled LIV Golf. Chadwick told CNN that, so long as there is no independent organization that monitors the reporting of every league\u2019s financial endeavors, \u201cnobody really knows for sure what the accurate financial information is.\u201d \u201cThis vacuum [of information], this uncertainty is wrapped in a veneer of lobbying, which is intended to either overinflate or underinflate player transfer values and salary information because it serves a political purpose,\u201d Chadwick says, adding that this purpose is \u201csignaling.\u201d \u201cIt is almost as though football players are becoming kind of geopolitical pawns in some ways.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/09/20/sport/saudi-arabia-soccer-spl-bin-salman-intl-spt-cmd-dg/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}

{"id": "2024_04_26_sport_aya-nakamura-france-culture-wars-paris-2024-spt-intl", "text": "Aya Nakamura was born in the former French colony of Mali, raised in France and is\u00a0widely considered\u00a0the most streamed female Francophone artist in the world. The 28-year-old,\u00a0as well as being Malian,\u00a0is a French citizen, and a multiple-platinum-selling pop star who was brought up in the Parisian suburbs. However,\u00a0ahead of Paris 2024, Nakamura finds herself at the\u00a0center\u00a0of France\u2019s culture wars. Amid widespread\u00a0rumors\u00a0the singer would\u00a0perform at the Games\u2019 Opening Ceremony, singing an Edith Piaf song,\u00a0some members of France\u2019s far-right have questioned\u00a0whether she embodies French heritage, values and identity.\u00a0Piaf is a key figure in France\u2019s musical \u2013 and national \u2013 identity. \u201cThere\u2019s no way Aya. This is Paris, not the market\u00a0in\u00a0Bamako,\u201d said fringe\u00a0and extreme\u00a0far-right group Les Natifs (Natives) on X, formerly known\u00a0as Twitter, in March, referring to Mali\u2019s capital. Nakamura has defended herself on social media, saying on X: \u201cI\u2019m becoming the number one state subject in debates\u00a0\u2026but what do I really owe you all? Nothing.\u201d The singer has received support from Rachida Dati, France\u2019s Minister of Culture, who spoke out in defence of Nakamura, saying \u201cbe careful of the pretext of attacking someone out of pure racism.\u201d Paris 2024\u2019s organizing committee told CNN: \u201cWe were very shocked by the racist attacks against Aya Nakamura in recent days. We offer our full support to the most listened-to French artist in the world.\u201d Whether Nakamura will perform at the Olympics\u2019 opening ceremony is still unconfirmed, with the Paris 2024 organizing committee telling CNN that they\u00a0\u201cwon\u2019t be confirming or denying\u201d\u00a0any rumors or reports, to \u201cleave room for surprises\u201d on the day. CNN has reached out to Nakamura but she declined to\u00a0be interviewed\u00a0on the matter. \u2018She contributes to French culture\u2019 However, many others in France are all too keen to comment on this cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. Far-right politician Marion Mar\u00e9chal,\u00a0who is the niece\u00a0of far-right National Rally party leader\u00a0Marine Le Pen and a member of the\u00a0Reconqu\u00eate\u00a0party, told French\u00a0television stations BMFTV and Europe 1\u00a0that Nakamura\u00a0\u201cdoes not sing in French,\u201d referencing the blend of Parisian and African\u00a0derived slang\u00a0that often feature in her lyrics. \u201cI think that the people who criticize her actually don\u2019t accept that she embodies France,\u201d\u00a0French activist Rokhaya Diallo told CNN. \u201cThe\u00a0slang she uses is used by young people and a lot of young French people use slang.\u201d Nakamura often uses a mix of verlan and African derived slang from languages such as Bambara, from her birth country Mali,\u00a0in her music. Her number one hit song\u00a0\u201cDjadja,\u201d\u00a0contains the lyric \u201cle monde est tit-pe\u201d \u2013 the world is small \u2013 with word \u2018tit-pe\u2019 inverting the French word \u2018petit.\u2019 Verlan, a type of French slang named after\u00a0the inversion of the French word \u2018l\u2019envers\u2019 \u2013 meaning backwards \u2013 originates from the outskirts of Paris known as \u2018la cit\u00e9\u2019 (the suburbs)\u00a0that have had\u00a0large\u00a0immigrant population. At the inauguration of the\u00a0Olympic Aquatics Centre\u00a0earlier this month, French President Emanuel Macron\u00a0said that Nakamura \u201cspeaks to a good number of our compatriots\u201d and claimed that \u201cthese\u00a0games and ceremonies should reflect us, and she contributes to French culture, to French music.\u201d \u201cI want to defend here these choices and defend the fact that there must be artistic freedom and that politics should not interfere,\u201d added Macron. In an interview with France Inter,\u00a0Macron\u2019s political rival Le Pen, known for her right-wing views, claimed that the President was seeking to \u201coutrage\u201d and \u201chumiliate the French people\u201d when asked whether she thinks Nakamura opening the games would be a\u00a0good symbol. When asked to further explain why this choice would be a humiliation, Le Pen responded \u201cshe does not sing in French, or a foreign language, she sings nonsense.\u201d Speaking to CNN, Professor of Political Science at the University of Nice,\u00a0Vincent\u00a0Martigny, said that\u00a0while\u00a0there are those who believe it is right to promote minorities and their role in French culture, there are others, who hold more traditional views, which he terms as racist in relation to the country\u2019s colonial past. 1998 World Cup There have been moments of\u00a0perceived\u00a0unity in France\u2019s past, notably when the men\u2019s national soccer team won the 1998 World Cup. That triumph helped popularise the slogan \u201cBlack, Blanc, Beur\u201d \u2013 Black, White, Arab\u00a0\u00a0\u2013\u00a0amid a push for unity and inclusion. Beur\u2019 is verlan for the French word \u2018arabe.\u2019 France\u2019s World Cup winning team of 1998\u00a0was made up of a\u00a0diverse\u00a0group\u00a0of players,\u00a0not only of European descent but also from the ex-colonies of France\u00a0and other countries.\u00a0Many thought\u00a0at the time\u00a0that the 1998 team was a sign of a truly integrated, multi-cultural France. But notable social and cultural divisions have emerged in France in recent years. There have been\u00a0multiple bans and restrictions against Islamic dress. The nationwide ban on\u00a0public\u00a0schoolchildren wearing abayas,\u00a0was\u00a0denounced as an \u201cIslamophobic campaign\u201d by\u00a0one\u00a0politician\u00a0on the left.\u00a0Athletes have been banned\u00a0from wearing a hijab while competing representing France\u00a0at the Paris\u00a0Olympic Games. Then there have been multiple protests and riots over police brutality leading to the death of\u00a0some French inhabitants of North and West African heritage\u00a0from the suburbs of Paris, fueling backlash over policing methods in marginalized communities. Nakamura\u2019s\u00a0birth\u00a0country\u00a0of Mali is one of the many\u00a0former\u00a0French colonies. There are millions of French citizens, like Nakamura, who are either themselves immigrants or descendants of immigrants from\u00a0nations formerly colonized by France. These days France\u00a0finds itself embroiled in a very public debate over the recognition and acceptance of its immigrants as the country continues to reckon with its colonial history. Professor Martigny believes that the\u00a0nationalist\u00a0party is \u201cstronger than ever\u201d and that nationalists in France are \u201cmore nationalist\u201d and more open with their views today than they were in the past. Activist Diallo also believes that France is struggling to see itself \u201cas it is\u201d and recognize non-White individuals as fully French. \u201cDespite her successes, despite her undeniable achievements, we still think that it\u2019s not an honor for us to have such a woman represent us,\u201d Diallo told CNN, referring to Nakamura. \u2018The Great Replacement\u2019 theory Political scientist Oliver Roy, who is Professor\u00a0at the EUI School of Transnational Governance, told CNN that a common belief that could be fuelling the culture wars in France is an ideology\u00a0expressed\u00a0\u201cnot just [by] the extreme right, but also part of the traditional centre right\u201d known as \u201cthe great replacement.\u201d He describes\u00a0the term\u00a0as \u201cthe idea that there is a new population coming from the south, which is replacing the old traditional, French population.\u201d However, he maintains that this fear \u201cis not supported by demography, [or] by statistics, and is, of course, very ideological.\u201d According to Martigny, France\u2019s cultural divisions are amplified on social media by both extremes of the political spectrum. \u201cBecause of the social networks, public debates are more violent on these issues than they used to be,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a theatre for the expression of extremely strong minded, sometimes racist, very often offensive comments on Twitter, on X, and on other social networks,\u201d added Martigny. \u201cYou have a lot of X accounts who are really, really, really pro far-right. And so they played a role in discussing these issues and making it a controversy. And then this controversy is exported to the traditional media.\u201d \u2018Show a very optimistic face for France\u2019 As Nakamura was targeted by fringe and extreme far-right groups as well as far-right politicians, in an interview\u00a0with BMFTV and RMC,\u00a0Macron said that \u201cthe reactions shocked me \u2026 there\u00a0were\u00a0truly racist reactions.\u201d However,\u00a0Martigny says he sees\u00a0Macron\u2019s condemnation of the attacks as racist as an attempt to balance the scales after the passing of\u00a0what the professor called\u00a0a \u201cvery restrictive law on immigration\u201d a few months ago. In December, Macron passed a controversial bill calling for tougher immigration that was endorsed by the far-right, and rejected by many in his own camp. Politicians such as Le Pen hailed the legislation as an \u201cideological victory\u201d whilst French health Minister, Aurelien Rousseau resigned in protest.\u00a0It included many amendments tightening immigration laws, one of which dictated children born to foreign parents on French soil would no longer become automatic French citizens but would have to apply for citizenship. \u201cHe needs to make that forgotten in a certain way by showing that he has a sense of balance on these issues,\u201d\u00a0Martigny states. By promoting Nakamura, Martigny believes that Macron\u2019s ambitions may have been to \u201cshow a very optimistic face for France.\u201d \u201c[There are] very strong cultural wars in France revolving around pop stars, and the type of pop stars that you can mobilize or the type of artists that you can mobilize when you want to unite the country.\u201d With less than 100 days to go until the Olympics, many hope Paris 2024 will give France the opportunity to show unity. However, the heated reactions to Nakamura hints at a more pessimistic outlook.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/26/sport/aya-nakamura-france-culture-wars-paris-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_19_sport_xander-schauffele-pga-championship-2024-winner-spt-intl", "text": "American golfer Xander Schauffele won the 106th PGA Championship on Sunday, holding off compatriot Bryson DeChambeau in a nail-biting finale to clinch a long-awaited first major title. World No. 3 Schauffele was pushed to the final hole at Valhalla Golf Club\u00a0in Louisville, Kentucky,\u00a0but the 30-year-old held his nerve to birdie and finish one stroke ahead of LIV Golf\u2019s DeChambeau at 21-under par overall. A final round six-under 65 was just enough to clinch a maiden major title for Schauffele, shredding his unwanted title as one of the most talented golfers to never win one of golf\u2019s four flagship events. The Californian had finished runner-up twice and 12 times inside the top 10 at the majors but broke his duck in style, opening Thursday with a spectacular 62 \u2013 the joint-lowest round score in major history \u2013 and signing off with a nerveless putt from just over six feet. \u201cI was actually kind of emotional after the putt lipped in,\u201d eight-time PGA Tour winner Schauffele, who claimed a $3.33 million winner\u2019s cut of an $18.5 million prize purse, said as he was presented with the Wanamaker Trophy. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve won, and I really just kept saying it all week, \u2018I just need to stay in my lane.\u2019 Man, was it hard to stay in my lane today, but I tried all day to just keep focus on what I\u2019m trying to do and keep every hole ahead of me.\u201d \u201cI just told myself, \u2018This is my opportunity, and just capture it,\u2019\u201d he added. DeChambeau laments his \u2018B\u2019 game  A fired up DeChambeau played a near-perfect round to push Schauffele to the death, shooting a bogey-free 64 as he hunted a second major crown. Having finished tied-sixth at the Masters, the big-hitting Californian looks to be getting closer to the form that helped him win the US Open in 2020. \u201cFirst \u2026 proud of Xander for finally getting the job done. He\u2019s an amazing golfer and a well deserved major champion now,\u201d DeChambeau told reporters. \u201cOn my side of the coin, disappointing, but, whatever. I played well. Didn\u2019t strike it my best all week. Felt like I had my \u2018B\u2019 game pretty much \u2026 but one that gives me a lot of momentum for the rest of the majors. \u201cI said today it was closing time, but it will be closing time hopefully over the next couple majors.\u201d Two shots behind DeChambeau in third, Norway\u2019s Viktor Hovland remains stuck with the unwanted title Schauffele has now escaped: \u2018nearly-man.\u2019 The 26-year-old had arrived at the final tee level with DeChambeau but could only bogey, resigning him to his third top-four major finish without silverware in the last two years. Collin Morikawa had been level with compatriot Schauffele at tee off on Sunday but, despite bogeying just once, could only muster the same number of birdies. The two-time major champion\u2019s even par 71 saw him finish in a share of fourth with Belgium\u2019s Thomas Detry at 15-under overall. Scheffler finishes with a flourish It was a suitably frenzied climax to a chaotic week in Lousville, with the event upended by the arrest of world No. 1 and tournament favorite Scottie Scheffler before Friday\u2019s second round. The 27-year-old is facing four charges, including felony assault, but returned to play mere hours after his release from jail to shoot a stellar 66. Last month\u2019s Masters champion went one better with a closing 65 but had left himself with too much ground to make up to clinch a second consecutive major after carding a frustrating two-over 73 on Saturday. He finished eight shots behind Schauffele in a share of eighth, a \u201cgood\u201d end to a \u201chectic\u201d week. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sit here and say that I played poorly yesterday because of what happened on Friday,\u201d Scheffler, who said he planned to play the PGA Tour\u2019s next event in Texas on Thursday, told reporters. \u201cI just had a bad day out on the course and was proud of how I came out here and bounced back today. \u201cSaturday morning, I think it finally hit me what really happened. Friday most of the day I didn\u2019t really even eat \u2026 as somebody who\u2019s a pretty big eater, that was a strange feeling, so obviously my body was a bit off with what had happened in the morning. \u201cI did my best to leave that behind me and come out here and compete and do what I love, and the support I got from the fans was amazing. I think they were cheering extra loud for me this week, and I got a lot of support from the players and caddies as well.\u201d Scheffler will undoubtedly be among the favorites again when the US Open, the next men\u2019s major on the calendar, tees off at Pinehurst Resort and Country Club in North Carolina on June 13. Nail-biter For a golfer who had faced questions over his ability to get over the line on the biggest stage, Schauffele looked at ease in the driving seat, rolling in a fourth birdie of the day at the ninth hole to make the turn with a two shot cushion. Yet by the time he approached the 11th tee, he was second. Schauffele\u2019s bogeyless run had come to to a shuddering halt at the previous hole when his four-foot putt lipped out. The window had opened by a crack for the first time and Hovland went crashing through it, lasering home his second birdie in a row \u2013 and his sixth of the round \u2013 at the 13th to surge into solo first. A collective thought of \u201chere we go again\u201d rippled around Valhalla, but clearly didn\u2019t reach the man it concerned. Schauffele responded immediately and emphatically, sinking back-to-back birdies to wrestle his lead back from Hovland. DeChambeau would not allow a two-horse race to materialize though, his superb play aided by a remarkable slice of luck at the 16th when his hooked tee shot \u2013 destined for the woods \u2013 careened off a tree and onto the fairway. A subsequent birdie saw him join playing partner Hovland within touching distance of Schauffele. The LIV Golf star roared in delight as his final putt just about trickled in for birdie, sending him back to the clubhouse fist-pumping and level with Schauffele. The picture was now simple but bubbling with tension. With Hovland missing his chance and Morikawa well behind, Schauffele had two holes to either win it, send it to a playoff, or suffer another agonizing near-miss. A par at the penultimate hole put the championship on a knife-edge at the par-five 18th. As DeChambeau warmed up for a potential playoff on the range, he watched a nearby screen intently as Schauffele\u2019s drive settled in a nasty-looking position on the edge of a bunker. His feet planted in the sand, it was a disaster waiting to happen, but Schauffele made it look easy. Two sublime shots later, he stood six feet away from a first major. After years of heart-wrenching close calls, it was perhaps poetic that the ball took a beat-skipping journey around the lip of the cup before dropping in. A long wait had ended, and euphoric celebrations could begin.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/sport/xander-schauffele-pga-championship-2024-winner-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Then, on a whim during her time as a student at Princeton University, Noble was convinced to try her hand at rowing. \u201cWhen I took my first steps into the sport, I had no thoughts or intentions of competing at a high level and certainly couldn\u2019t have imagined that this would be the direction that things would go,\u201d Noble tells CNN Sport. \u201cTo be honest, it is still a bit surreal to be competing on a stage like this. I don\u2019t think it was until they actually told me that Uganda wanted to send me to the Olympic qualifiers that I really thought, \u2018Oh, okay, maybe there\u2019s something here.\u2019\u201d Equipment issues The sport of rowing is still very much in its nascent stages across many parts of Africa, including Uganda. It was properly introduced to the country back in 2009 when the World Rowing Federation sent out a shipment of donated boats to help to grow a sport which carries with it significant financial entry barriers. It was on these boats that Noble learned to row skull (individual), as opposed to her time rowing crew (as a team in one boat) at university. Whilst the thought of training on Lake Victoria, one of Africa\u2019s Great Lakes and the world\u2019s largest tropical lake, may bring with it a sense of charm and serenity, trying to prepare to compete at Olympic level just isn\u2019t feasible given the lack of opportunities and investment afforded to rowing within Uganda, a reality which sees Noble now train out of Tennessee under former US rower James Martinez. \u201cThere is no history of rowing in Uganda. I mean, I\u2019m literally the first person, male or female, to even qualify for the Olympics,\u201d Noble says. \u201cIt is still extremely niche, and the community is very small. I probably know every single rower in the country personally. \u201cBack in 2016, I took eight months off from university to row in Uganda and I\u2019m so grateful that I did because I got to experience first-hand all the struggles that rowers back home go through on a daily basis. \u201cNot only is there a lack of competition and adequate coaching, but there is a lack of most basic essentials, such as having properly functioning equipment. \u201cWhen I was rowing on Lake Victoria, we were still using the boats donated back in 2009. We would be duct-taping them and trying to get people to patch them up with fiberglass for us.\u201d It is not just a lack of equipment which has hampered rowing\u2019s growth in the east African country. Governance is also a major issue, and the absence of proper oversight has seen many athletes leave the sport in recent times, according to Noble, due to \u201cpromises being made but not always being kept.\u201d The only way the sport has a chance to progress is through the help and funding from outside donors such as the World Rowing Federation. Muhumuza Rodrick Chandi,\u00a0the technical director of the Uganda\u00a0Rowing Federation, tells CNN Sport that the price of equipment and a lack of coaches has been an issue in the country. \u201cIt is true that there is a lack of coaches as most qualified ones have left Uganda in search of greener pastures,\u201d he says.\u00a0\u201cRowing, like most sports in Uganda, is voluntary, so once these coaches get better opportunities they migrate or leave the sport altogether. \u201cThe Ugandan Rowing Federation does suffer from a lack of funding, mainly because it doesn\u2019t get much budgetary support from the National Council of Sports as it\u2019s considered a small sport.\u201d \u2018Honor\u2019 representing Uganda Born in Nakaseke, central Uganda, in 1994, Noble is the daughter of Irish missionaries. \u201cUganda was a fantastic place to grow up in many ways, whether it be the great weather all year round or the friendly and cheerful nature of the people,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut as a White, blonde child, I maybe would have had an aversion to going out in public due to the amount of attention I\u2019d have gotten.\u201d Despite her differences, of which Noble is acutely aware, sport has allowed her to form a deeper connection with her birthplace. \u201cEven though I have Ugandan citizenship, there is an identity to being Ugandan which is about coming from one of the local tribes and having land and a history and ancestors going back a long way,\u201d she says. \u201cI respect that, but at the same time, I did grow up in Uganda. It\u2019s a place that is important to me and it does mean a lot to me to have people accept me as being Ugandan. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge honor to represent my country. It\u2019s been the way that I\u2019ve felt the most connection to my identity as a Ugandan. Growing up there, when people ask you where you\u2019re from, I would say Ireland, even though I was born and grew up there. \u201cBut I feel like as I\u2019ve gotten deeper into representing and rowing for the country, I have felt more strongly that I am Ugandan.\u201d Noble\u2019s acceptance by Ugandan sports fans has also been a great source of encouragement. While she says that she will occasionally receive the odd message on social media criticizing her for representing the country, the overwhelming majority of both fan and media messaging has been support and pride for raising the profile of Ugandan rowing. \u201cYou\u2019re always going to have haters and people who want to try to knock you down, that\u2019s kind of to be expected in high level sport nowadays with social media \u2026 but I find it extremely touching that whenever I am met with negativity, a barrage of positivity will follow,\u201d says Noble. \u201cI\u2019m very, very grateful for that.\u201d Platform for change Noble, on top of her sporting ambitions, works as a software engineer in Tennessee and, alongside her husband, is a homesteader with a small-scale farm producing food and animals for themselves. Like every athlete, she hopes that her Olympic journey will culminate atop the podium, but she does also head to Paris with a compelling sense of realism. \u201cRowing is not really a sport where you wake up and just have a great day and row faster than you ever have before,\u201d says Noble. \u201cIt is a little bit more deterministic than that. Sports that are really based around cardiovascular strength tend to remove that element of major surprise around results. I\u2019m not going to flat out say that my goal isn\u2019t to medal, but at the same time I need to be realistic.\u201d Winning a medal is not the only means by which you can determine an Olympian\u2019s success, though, with Noble hoping that her exposure during the Games can help to elevate rowing back in Uganda, ensuring that she is no longer its sole representative. \u201cI feel a sense of responsibility to try and help support athletes back home,\u201d she says. \u201cWhether that correlates to me having to do well, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily true. I get a lot of press whether I come first or last. \u201cI believe that the actual position that I come is less important than the spotlight that exists around the Olympics. That gives me the platform to raise awareness about the limitations and struggles that athletes have in Uganda to a global audience.\u201d Rowing, particularly singles rowing, can be a very isolating sport, a fact that Noble can attest to. But come July 26 when the Paris Games get underway, she will have the backing of an entire nation eager to witness what will, no matter the end result, be more Olympic history for Uganda.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/sport/kathleen-noble-rowing-uganda-paris-olympics-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}

In an address to graduates at\u00a0Benedictine College, a small Catholic school in Atchison, Kansas, Butker called Pride Month a \u201cdeadly sin\u201d and said that a woman\u2019s accomplishments in the home are more valuable than any academic or professional goals, among other things. \u201cI cherish him as a teammate. I think Pat [Mahomes] said it best where he is every bit of a great person and a great teammate,\u201d\u00a0Kelce said on the latest episode of the \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast he hosts with his brother, Jason. \u201cHe\u2019s treated friends and family that I\u2019ve introduced to him with nothing but respect and kindness and that\u2019s how he treats everyone. When it comes down to his views and what he said at Saint Benedict\u2019s commencement speech, those are his. \u201cI can\u2019t say I agree with the majority of it or just about any of it outside of just him loving his family and his kids and I don\u2019t think that I should judge him by his views, especially his religious views, of how to go about life. That\u2019s just not who I am.\u201d His comments echoed what Chiefs teammate and three-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback Mahomes told reporters on Wednesday. Mahomes said that Butker was a \u201cgood person,\u201d despite \u201cnot necessarily agreeing\u201d with his comments. Jason Kelce added: \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be opinions that everybody shares that you\u2019re going to disagree with. \u201cAnd make no mistake about it, a lot of the things he said in his commencement speech are not things that I align myself with. But, he\u2019s giving a commencement speech at a Catholic university, and, shocker, it ended up being a very religious and Catholic speech. \u201cTo me, I can listen to somebody talk and take great value in it, like when he\u2019s talking about the importance of family and the importance that a great mother can make, while also acknowledging that not everybody has to be a homemaker if that\u2019s not what they want to do in life.\u201d Travis Kelce said he was grateful for his \u201cbeautiful upbringing\u201d in Cleveland Heights, surrounded by \u201cdifferent social classes, different religions, different races and ethnicities.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why I love Cleveland Heights for what it was,\u201d he added. \u201cIt showed me a broad spectrum, just a broad view of a lot of different walks of life.

{"id": "2024_05_26_sport_indy-500-spt-intl", "text": "Josef Newgarden used a scintillating last-lap pass to win the Indianapolis 500 on Sunday for the second consecutive year in a race that started four hours late due to extreme weather. \u201cI\u2019m just so proud of the team. They crushed it. I mean, crushed it. \u2026 They came here with the fastest cars. We worked our tails off,\u201d Newgarden told race broadcaster NBC. The Indy 500, one of the most prestigious and highly-anticipated events of the motorsport calendar, began four hours late on Sunday afternoon after lightning and extreme weather caused organizers to pause pre-race festivities, evacuate fans from the grandstands and wait for rain to pass and the track to dry up. The race was initially scheduled to begin at 12:45 p.m. ET but was pushed back to 4:45 p.m. When it got underway, it was a fan\u2019s delight, with passes at the front of the field and in the pack. There were a race-record 16 different leaders and 87 lead changes. Newgarden and Pato O\u2019Ward battled for the win in the final laps, with Newgarden passing the Arrow McLaren driver on Turn 3 of the last trip around the 2.5-mile circuit to win the race by just 0.3417 of a second. Newgarden is the sixth driver to win back-to-back races in Indianapolis and the first since H\u00e9lio Castroneves in 2002. The win gave team owner Roger Penske 20 victories in \u201cThe Greatest Spectacle in Racing.\u201d Newgarden, a two-time IndyCar Series champion, and Team Penske were involved in a cheating scandal at the start of the season in March. Newgarden had his season opening victory in St. Petersburg, Florida, disqualified after IndyCar uncovered three Team Penske cars had illegal push-to-pass software on them. \u201cAbsolutely, they can say whatever they\u00a0want after this point, I don\u2019t care any more,\u201d Newgarden said after the Indy 500. O\u2019Ward was left near tears by his runner-up finish, a result that came two years after he similarly lost the lead of the Indy 500 on the last lap. \u201cJust so close again. So f\u2014\u2014 close,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just so painful when you put so much into it.\u201d He called Newgarden a great competitor. \u201cI knew it was going to be a fight until the end. Just two corners short,\u201d he said. \u201cI really thought that I did everything in my power to get it done.\u201d O\u2019Ward told reporters at a news conference that some of the other racers were driving like maniacs on restarts and he was driving defensively for 85% of the race. \u201cWe had so many near, near race-enders,\u201d he told NBC earlier. Third-place finisher Scott Dixon, who won the event in 2008, said the race was \u201cpretty full on.\u201d \u201cIt was pretty action-packed. At the end there when you\u2019re kind of capturing third, you hope that the first two are going to take each other out, but obviously that didn\u2019t happen,\u201d he said. \u201cA little bit of drama, but I thought everybody raced pretty cleanly,\u201d Dixon added. The Indy 500 regularly shares a date with the famous Monaco Grand Prix, known as the \u201ccrown jewel\u201d of the Formula One calendar. Earlier Sunday, hometown hero Charles Leclerc won the race around the streets of Monte Carlo for the first time. 500 miles, a flight, then more racing NASCAR Cup points leader Kyle Larson is attempting to drive the Indy 500 and Coca-Cola 600 in the same day \u2013 a feat made more difficult due to the weather delay. Larson raced in Indy and led some laps but finished 18th as an Indianapolis 500 rookie. He had qualified an impressive fifth as a driver for Arrow McLaren. After driving in the Indy 500 and doing postrace media, Larson will head to the Charlotte Motor Speedway in North Carolina in an attempt to finish two major motorsport races in the same day, though he will have to take over from another driver who will take his place for the start of the 600. The green flag for the NASCAR race came at 6 p.m. ET. Larson, the 2021 NASCAR Cup Series champion, is attempting to become the fifth driver to start both races. John Andretti was the first to accomplish this in 1994, with Robby Gordon and Tony Stewart subsequently taking on the Double on five and two occasions respectively. It was most recently attempted by Kurt Busch in 2014. \u201cThe Double\u201d is regarded as one of the toughest challenges in motorsport due to the mental and physical toll of driving 1,100 miles in a single day, navigating the differences between open-wheel and stock cars and the exhausting travel schedule. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be just referenced as the greatest NASCAR driver of all time or the greatest sprint car driver of all time, I want to be known as somebody who could climb into all different types of cars and be great at what they do,\u201d Larson said in 2021, per NASCAR. Defying Father Time One of only four drivers to win the Indy 500 four times, Castroneves was seeking history on Sunday when he lined up at the Brickyard for the 24th time. A win on Sunday for the Brazilian would have seen him stand alone as the only person to win the race on five occasions. At 49 years old, Castroneves was aiming to become the oldest \u2018500 winner ever and does not plan to hit the brakes any time soon. Despite high hopes, he finished in 20th place Sunday. \u201c(Racing at 50) was always my goal, but I don\u2019t want to just \u2018do it\u2019,\u201d he told Indy Star. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re still very competitive, and not only just to win, but to make people go crazy here, and that\u2019s what I want to do. \u201cRight now, I want to keep it going, because that\u2019s what I know best. I\u2019m sure this will change, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be in the near future.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/26/sport/indy-500-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Kennedy Jr.\u2019s running mate in the US presidential race. CNN previously reported Kennedy had met with Rodgers about the possibility of joining Kennedy\u2019s campaign. Kennedy ultimately named Silicon Valley attorney and entrepreneur Nicole Shanahan as his vice-presidential pick. \u201cThere were really two options. Retire and be his VP or keep playing. I wanted to keep playing,\u201d the 40-year-old Rodgers told reporters as the New York Jets quarterback spoke for the first time about the potential choice he had to make when it came to switching the pigskin for the podium. CNN has reached out to the Kennedy campaign for comment. Rodgers is entering his second season with the Jets after missing almost the entirety of his first campaign in New York having ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four snaps into his debut. Although he returned to the practice field towards the end of last season, Rodgers never returned to NFL action in the 2024 season. The Jets have begun their offseason program, beginning with organized team practice activities (OTA) which Rodgers has been a full participant in. \u201cIt\u2019s just about the mental part,\u201d said Rodgers as he ramps up his return from injury, four months ahead of the new season. \u201cThese practices have been nice the last couple of days. Feel what it\u2019s like to be out there, to be moving around, to not be thinking about it and see how I respond the next day. This is the last part,\u201d he added. \u201cThe strength is good, the movement is good, just the confidence to do everything.\u201d Jets head coach Robert Saleh told reporters that Rodgers has no restrictions during practice sessions, and the four-time MVP says that he feels like he \u201ccan do anything\u201d right now. \u201cI can run at top speed. It\u2019s just, in those moments, the reactions coming naturally.\u201d After Rodgers\u2019 injury in the opening game of the 2023 season, the Jets endured a disappointing season as a result of turbulent quarterback play and underwhelming offensive performances. But with Rodgers back in the line-up, expectations are high ahead of the new season. \u201cWell, I think if I don\u2019t do what I\u2019m capable of doing, then we\u2019re all probably gonna be out of here (next season),\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cI like that kind of pressure, though. \u201cI know it\u2019s a tough market to play in; it\u2019s not for everybody. Relish that opportunity. That\u2019s the way the NFL is. \u201cAs you get older in the league, if you do not perform, they\u2019re going to get rid of you or bring in the next guy to take over. It happened in Green Bay, and I\u2019m a few years older than I was back then. I expect to play at a high level, I expect us to be productive and competitive, and all that stuff to take care of itself.\u201d The Jets open the 2024 season on the road against the San Francisco 49ers, the defending NFC champions, on Monday Night Football on September 9.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/sport/aaron-rodgers-rfk-jr-vp-presidential-nfl-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Adam Armstrong scored the only goal of the game in the first half as Southampton defeated Leeds United 1-0 in the Championship play-off final at Wembley Stadium to book its return to the top-flight of English soccer. According to Deloitte\u2019s Sports Business Group, Southampton will receive at least \u00a3140 million ($177 million) across the next three seasons through \u201cprojected increases in matchday, broadcast and commercial revenue.\u201d That would increase to more than \u00a3305 million ($386 million) if the club avoids relegation in its first season. Southampton joins both Leicester City and Ipswich Town in securing promotion to the Premier League this season. After the game, Southampton\u2019s captain Jack Stephens struggled to control his emotions as he summed up his elation, calling it \u201cthe best feeling I\u2019ve ever had in football.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m so proud to be captain of this club. I\u2019m so proud of the boys today, I think they\u2019ve been unbelievable,\u201d Stephens told Sky Sports. \u201cI think we probably didn\u2019t play our best game today but we showed a different side. A few people have doubted us over this season. Can we defend? Can we dig in? I think we really showed that today.\u201d A lot on the line With a place in the Premier League on the line \u2013 and the financial reward that comes with it \u2013 the Championship play-off final comes with high stakes and high pressure. And the pressure was particularly high ahead of this year\u2019s final, with both teams looking to bounce back to the top-flight of English soccer at the first time of asking having suffered relegation last season. Pouring rain before the game in northwest London only heightened to add to the dramatic nature of the day, before bright sunshine broke through as the game began. The game\u2019s opening exchanges were played with the magnitude of the occasion weighing on them, with chances few and far between. But the game sparked into life halfway through the first half when a neat through-ball from Southampton midfielder Will Smallbone sprung Armstrong running into the Leeds box before he blasted the ball past goalkeeper Illan Meslier to score his 24th league goal of the season. Despite Leeds opening up in the hopes of an equalizer, it was Southampton who came closest to doubling its lead, with only Meslier and key defensive interventions sparing Leeds from going into halftime with a two-goal deficit. Just minutes into the second half, Leeds almost drew level but Crysencio Summerville\u2019s curled effort flew just wide of the post. Leeds continued to pile on the pressure in search of that illusive equalizer and came inches away from doing so when Wales international Dan James hit a curling effort against the bar.

It was a cagey encounter, with clearcut chances few and far between as both teams\u2019 defenses canceled out one another. Aitana Bonmat\u00ed opened the scoring at the San Mam\u00e9s Stadium, her left-footed strike midway through the second half deflecting into the Lyon goal. And in the final few moments, Al\u00e8xia Putellas wrapped up a famous victory with her 190th goal for the club. The victory, Barcelona\u2019s third Women\u2019s Champions League title, completes a historic quadruple this season for the Spanish giant \u2013 the Blaugrana has already won the Liga F, Copa de la Reina and Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a trophies. It cements Bar\u00e7a\u2019s status as the one of the best club teams in world soccer over the last few years. \u201cWe knew we needed to be a club that made history,\u201d Barcelona defender Lucy Bronze told broadcaster DAZN afterwards. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy, it\u2019s hard to win it once, but to do it back to back, Lyon showed how difficult it is. \u201cThis team\u2019s finally done that. I think we go down in history as one of the best teams in Europe.\u201d Tight margins The final was a clash of Europe\u2019s two titanic sides; Barcelona has soared to ascendancy over recent years while Lyon has dominated the competition since first winning it in 2011 \u2013 Saturday\u2019s final was the club\u2019s 11th Women\u2019s Champions League final and its eight titles is double that of any other team. With the game being played in Spain, the atmosphere inside the San Mam\u00e9s felt like a home game for Barcelona with the stadium dominated by its famous red and blue colors. And with such high stakes on the line, there was little to separate the two teams. Both sets of defenders reigned supreme, with chances at a premium. After a cagey opening 45 minutes, Barcelona carved the best opportunity to break the deadlock on the stroke of halftime, with Caroline Graham Hansen\u2019s tricky run bamboozling defenders but the Norwegian international could only drag her shot past the post. Just minutes into the second half, Lyon could have taken a lead against the run of play but Wendie Renard was unable to keep her effort down. With little two separate the two teams, it took a moment of magic to open the scoring. Bonmat\u00ed, the 2023 Ballon d\u2019Or F\u00e9minin winner, received a delicate pass from Mariona Caldentey before dancing into the Lyon box and firing a left-footed effort towards goal. Her attempt took a slight deflection off a despairing defender which lifted it into the roof of the net and sent the majority inside the San Mam\u00e9s Stadium delirious. That goal seemed to open up proceedings, with Lyon now needing a goal to claw its way back into the final. Lyon piled the pressure on Barcelona but some heroic Blaugrana defense held strong, with only some last ditch interventions preventing the French side drawing level. The addition of Lyon\u2019s talismanic striker, Ada Hegerberg, offered a physical target for Lyon to play off but the Norwegian striker was forced to feed off scraps as Barcelona\u2019s defenders fielded a barrage of crosses. And with Lyon pressing, a storybook evening in Bilbao was capped off in fine fashion when Putellas \u2013 who has dealt with injuries over recent years but remains a legend at Barcelona \u2013 rifled the ball into the top of the net to seal the victory in stoppage time and get the party started. In Bonmat\u00ed and Putellas, Barcelona has two Ballon d\u2019Or F\u00e9minin winners and they both showed their match-winning capabilities to cap a magical season.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/sport/barcelona-lyon-womens-champions-league-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}

In the current era of women\u2019s tennis, no player has achieved so much in such a short space of time, and even \u015awi\u0105tek admits that her success has been a surprise. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s hard to get a grasp on it because it all happened so fast,\u201d she tells CNN Sport. \u201cWhen I was younger, I wouldn\u2019t even expect myself to be in the top five, (let alone) these kinds of stats. \u201cFor sure, I\u2019m proud of myself and of the team, because without them I wouldn\u2019t be in that place.\u201d \u015awi\u0105tek is most prolific on her preferred surface of clay, and the French Open, where she is a three-time champion, is her favorite of the four grand slams. She has only lost twice at Roland Garros, accumulating 28 wins since her debut in 2019. Whichever qualifier or lucky loser faces \u015awi\u0105tek in the first round could be the next victim. But being the world No. 1 and commanding so much success in a single tournament comes with its own challenges, particularly when you\u2019re the one player in the draw everyone wants to beat. \u201cSometimes I get this feeling off the court a little bit, or when I analyze these matches and I see that these players were super-motivated, more than usual when they played against me,\u201d says \u015awi\u0105tek. \u201cBut on the other hand, when you\u2019re on court, you don\u2019t have time to think about things like that \u2026 The best way, honestly, is really taking it step-by-step, not looking at the draws and not thinking what can happen in the quarterfinals or semifinals because there\u2019s still a long way (to go).\u201d Having spent more than 100 weeks as the world No. 1, \u015awi\u0105tek is growing used to the added pressures and responsibilities of being the world\u2019s top-ranked player. The process, however, has been a learning curve: as well as handling her high expectations for every tournament, she has had to deal with increased focus from the media and the demands of her widening portfolio of sponsors. For a self-described introvert, that hasn\u2019t always been straightforward. \u201cPeople really accept that I\u2019m an introvert and sometimes I like things quiet and not too much noise around me,\u201d says \u015awi\u0105tek. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to really take it easy and manage all these obligations well so it\u2019s not too much.\u201d One way of handling these demands has been working closely with her sports psychologist, Daria Abramowicz, who travels around the world as part of \u015awi\u0105tek\u2019s team of trainers. The focus is primarily on performance \u2013 improving concentration, dealing with high-pressure environments, and learning how to stay calm on the court \u2013 but Abramowicz\u2019s influence also extends beyond that. \u201cWhen we started working in 2019, I was really, really introverted,\u201d says \u015awi\u0105tek. \u201cShe helped me to feel more comfortable in the world around me, and I think without that part of the work that we did, I wouldn\u2019t be able to handle all this pressure and attention that you get when you become world No. 1. \u201cShe\u2019s the kind of person that will kind of tell me, \u2018Oh, Iga, I think you\u2019re doing too much, you need to really focus on your game right now because I see that it\u2019s harder for you to concentrate,\u2019 or things like that.\u201d Among \u015awi\u0105tek\u2019s list of sponsors are Porsche, Rolex, LEGO \u2013 which she uses as part of her mental preparation \u2013 and cosmetic brand Lanc\u00f4me \u2013 with whom she is the first athlete to sign a worldwide ambassador deal. Last year, she became the first female athlete to be sponsored by sportswear brand On and has helped to develop the company inaugural tennis range. \u201cI feel really taken care of,\u201d says \u015awi\u0105tek of the partnership, \u201cwhich is sometimes a struggle when you work with companies that have 20 other athletes just in one sport.\u201d \u201cBeyond Number One,\u201d a short film produced by On about her rise to the summit of tennis, released earlier this week. Given her sustained success in recent years, it\u2019s no surprise that \u015awi\u0105tek has attracted so much attention from sponsors. She was named as Forbes\u2019 highest-paid female athlete last year having earned $23.9 million \u2013 $9.9 million in prize money and $14 million off the court \u2013 topping the list ahead of Chinese freestyle skier Eileen Gu and American rival Coco Gauff. Tennis players, including Emma Raducanu, Naomi Osaka, and Aryna Sabalenka, made up nine of the top 10 and 12 of the top 20 on Forbes\u2019 list. \u201cShe has been really the first player since Serena (Williams) and (Maria) Sharapova retired that has been consistent week in and week out, competing to win grand slams every time she steps on the court,\u201d Max Eisenbud, \u015awi\u0105tek\u2019s agent at IMG, tells CNN Sport about the reasons for her commercial success. \u201cI think that consistency in play has certainly separated her and made her very attractive to potential endorsers \u2026 Brands like that she\u2019s real \u2013 she is who she is \u2013 and I think that\u2019s refreshing. Sometimes when you get into this whole social media world, this whole influencer world, it\u2019s not the case with realness.\u201d For \u015awi\u0105tek, that \u201crealness\u201d means talking openly about her love for Taylor Swift, LEGO \u2013 last year, she was gifted a model of Rome\u2019s Colosseum for her birthday \u2013 or reading in the park. She enjoyed the autobiographies of Andre Agassi and Lindsey Vonn but generally prefers fiction to sports books. \u201cI sometimes have too much sport in my life,\u201d \u015awi\u0105tek admits. Eisenbud calls her a \u201cdream client\u201d and \u201cone of the most professional athletes I\u2019ve ever been around.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s waking up every day and thinking about how to be great, and that\u2019s from her diet to her sleep to her decisions that she\u2019s making,\u201d he adds. This dedicated, detailed approach has helped to create the best all-around game in women\u2019s tennis right now \u2013 aggressive groundstrokes, a vicious, topspin-laden forehand, and canny movement around the court. At Roland Garros, \u015awi\u0105tek could become only the third woman to win three consecutive titles in the Open Era after Monica Seles and Justine Henin \u2013 potentially another landmark on her impressive resume. She would be 23 by then but already with more titles and accolades than most tennis players could dream of; after her own, modest childhood ambitions, the possibilities for \u015awi\u0105tek\u2019s career seem limitless.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/sport/iga-swiatek-profile-french-open-tennis-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Inter\u2019s Chinese owner, Suning, failed to repay a loan now worth \u20ac395 million ($428 million) that was taken out to help finance the club during the Covid pandemic. In a statement, Oaktree said: \u201cWe understand the great responsibility towards the community and the historical legacy of Inter. \u201cWe are committed to the long-term success of the Nerazzurri and believe that our ambitions for the Club match those of its passionate fans in Italy and around the world.\u201d Oaktree is an industry powerhouse co-founded by Howard Marks with $192 billion in assets under management. Suning bought a majority stake in Inter back in 2016 and the club has enjoyed consistent success in the eight years under Chinese ownership, twice winning Serie A and the Coppa Italia. The team also won three Italian Supercups and reached the finals of the Champions League and Europa League. \u201cDuring the approach of the pending Oaktree facility redemption date, we have been making every attempt with our partner to find an amicable resolution, including multiple paths for Oaktree to achieve full and immediate financial return,\u201d former Inter president Steven Zhang said in a statement on Saturday. \u201cUnfortunately, our efforts to date have been exasperated by legal threats, and a lack of meaningful engagement from Oaktree. \u201cNot only has this been deeply frustrating and disappointing, such behavior now poses potential risks to the Club that could seriously jeopardize its stability.\u201d After contacting Oaktree for comment on Zhang\u2019s statement, the firm referred CNN to its press release. \u201cAs new owners, we recognize our responsibility to Inter Milan\u2019s community, history and legacy,\u201d Oaktree\u2019s Alejandro Cano said in a statement.

{"id": "2024_05_24_sport_rafael-nadal-alexander-zverev-french-open-draw-spt-intl", "text": "Rafael Nadal has been given a tough assignment against world No. 4 Alexander Zverev in the opening round of what is set to be the final French Open of his career. Ranked No. 276 in the world, Nadal\u2019s unseeded status coming into Roland Garros, a tournament he has won an astonishing 14 times, meant a clash against another heavyweight in the first round was always a possibility. While Nadal has beaten Zverev seven times in their previous 10 meetings, the German is one of the favorites to lift the title. The tournament starts on May 26. The fourth seed arrives at Roland Garros full of confidence after winning the Italian Open last week, his ninth Masters 1000 title. The two last met in an intense 2022 French Open semifinal where Zverev retired mid-match following an ankle injury that sidelined him for the rest of the year. The 37-year-old Nadal has lost just three times at Roland Garros since making his debut in 2005 and will need to muster every ounce of his experience to ensure an in-form Zverev doesn\u2019t add to that tally. An end of an era Nadal said last May that 2024 was likely to be his last year on the tour, but the Spaniard has continued to struggle with injuries since his announcement, impacting his ability to train and play at a high level. The 22-time grand slam champion even admitted after his heavy second-round defeat to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open earlier this month that he wasn\u2019t sure if would be able to play at the French Open. Nadal missed the Australian Open this season due to injury and has played in just four tournaments so far this year, his best result coming at the Madrid Open where he reached the fourth round. Elsewhere, defending champion Novak Djokovic will face Pierre-Hugues Herbert in the opening round, while former winner Stanislas Wawarinka will play former finalist Andy Murray, who is also likely to be appearing at his last French Open.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/sport/rafael-nadal-alexander-zverev-french-open-draw-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "sports"}}
