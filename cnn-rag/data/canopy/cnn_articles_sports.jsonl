The Lakers selected the younger James with the 55th pick of the 2024 NBA Draft last week, which means that he and the four-time NBA champion could become the first father-son duo to play in the league at the same time. \u201cI\u2019ve already seen it, media and on the internet and stuff talking about [how] I might not deserve an opportunity, but I\u2019ve been dealing with stuff like this for my whole life, so it\u2019s nothing different,\u201d James told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s more amplified for sure, but I can get through it.\u201d During his lone season at the University of Southern California, the 19-year-old played 25 games and averaged 4.8 points, 2.8 rebounds and 2.1 assists. He was hospitalized after suffering a cardiac arrest during practice at USC last year, causing him to miss the first eight games of the season as he recovered from a procedure to treat a congenital heart defect. Later this month, James will make his Summer League debut with the Lakers but said he hasn\u2019t spoken too much to his father about playing together in the NBA. \u201cWe haven\u2019t gone too deep into that stuff yet because we haven\u2019t even started Summer League,\u201d said James. \u201cBut stuff that he\u2019s been telling me my whole life \u2013 just having that work ethic and coming in and getting your work in and listening to your coaches and being coachable. Stuff like that he\u2019s driven into my head my whole life.\u201d New Lakers head coach JJ Redick, meanwhile, stressed that he and general manager Rob Pelinka \u201cdid not give Bronny anything.\u201d He added: \u201cBronny has earned this through hard work and, for us prioritizing player development, we view Bronny as case study one because his base level of feel, athleticism, point of attack defender, shooting, passing \u2013 there\u2019s a lot to like about his game. \u201cAs we build out our player development program holistically, he\u2019s going to have a great opportunity to become an excellent NBA player.\u201d LeBron James has previously spoken about his desire to play alongside Bronny in the NBA, telling The Athletic in 2022 that his final year in the league will be alongside his son.

Tatum and the Celtics have agreed on a five-year, supermax contract extension worth $314 million through the 2029-30 season, according to Charania. CNN has reached out to the Celtics and Tatum\u2019s agent but did not immediately hear back. Last month, the 26-year-old \u2013 along with co-star Jaylen Brown \u2013 led the Celtics to an NBA-record 18th\u00a0title in franchise history after defeating the Dallas Mavericks in five games, averaging 22.2 points, 7.8 rebounds and 7.2 assists.

{"id": "2024_07_01_sport_carlos-alcaraz-wimbledon-spt-intl", "text": "For Carlos Alcaraz, age is just a number. The Spanish tennis prodigy is no stranger when it comes defying logic, expectations and time to rewrite the history books. The youngest year-end No. 1 in the history of men\u2019s tennis at just 19. The youngest male player to win three grand slams on three different surfaces \u2013 the 2022 US Open, Wimbledon in 2023 and the French Open in 2024 \u2013 at 21. Achievements, incidentally, already inked on his skin. As he prepares to defend his Wimbledon title, the boy born to be world No. 1 is intent on fulfilling grander ambitions. \u201cI want to be one of the best in history. I am dreaming that big,\u201d Alcaraz told CNN Sport at a Babolat event, the official partner and equipment supplier of Wimbledon, prior to the tournament. \u201cI want to sit [at] the same table as the \u2018Big Three\u2019 [Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer], legends of our sports.\u201d Culture of success Given the rate at which Alcaraz is racking up grand slam titles, you\u2019d be bold to bet against him joining the game\u2019s top table. But has he been surprised at how quickly he\u2019s risen through the tennis ranks? \u201cSometimes,\u201d he smiles. \u201cHonestly, [though], I don\u2019t think too much about it. I just kind of live in the moment, live in the present. \u201cIf I look back, [of course] I\u2019ve achieved great things so far, but it\u2019s something that I don\u2019t want to think about and I want to keep going.\u201d Alcaraz\u2019s team, led by former world No. 1 and 2003 French Open winner Juan Carlos Ferrero, have instilled a mentality that emphasizes the importance of perseverance and hard work \u2013 \u201ca culture of effort\u201d \u2013 as his physiotherapist Juanjo Moreno told CNN in 2022. In addition to the culture of excellence built around him, the Spanish star has also been able to take inspiration from his compatriots \u2013 a long line of Spanish men and women who have tasted grand slam success. Take, for example, the French Open. Nadal leads the way with a record-breaking 14 titles at the tournament, while the aforementioned Ferrero, Albert Costa, Carlos Moy\u00e1, Sergi Bruguera and Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza have all been champions since 1993. Alcaraz is now spearheading a new generation of Spanish talent set on building on the legacy of his predecessors. What, though, does he put this success down to? \u201cIn Spain, we have a lot of players to practice, a lot of places, amazing players. We eat well, the weather,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of the country that I am [from] and I think that\u2019s something super great for Spain, for Spanish sport and, obviously, for myself.\u201d Title defence Alcaraz begins the defense of his Wimbledon crown on Monday against Estonia\u2019s Mark Lajal. Aside from looking to win back-to-back titles on the grass courts of SW19, the 21-year-old also has a chance to do what only five male players in the Open Era have done: winning the French Open and Wimbledon in the same season. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s even more special coming [back] as a defending champion,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m trying not to think about the pressure that I have to defend the points or [that I] want  to go far. \u201cI just want to be better every day, trying to play my best in every match and give 100%. \u201cI think that the difference [with] last year is I\u2019m a little bit more mature and I know how to play on grass. I have more experiences about playing in this surface.\u201d Alcaraz goes into the tournament as the joint favorite, alongside current world No. 1 Jannik Sinner, to lift the men\u2019s title. The duo are scheduled to meet in a potential blockbuster semifinal matchup. And should the stars align, we could have a repeat of last year\u2019s epic five-set thriller between Alcaraz and Djokovic. The 37-year-old Serb arrives at Wimbledon having recently undergone knee surgery after tearing the\u00a0meniscus in his right knee during his fourth-round match against Francisco Cer\u00fandolo at last month\u2019s French Open. Were Djokovic to equal Roger Federer\u2019s record of eight Wimbledon titles, he would become the oldest champion of the modern era. Alcaraz, though, is fully focused on doing what he needs to do. \u201cFor me, it doesn\u2019t matter against who I\u2019m going to play,\u201d he explains. \u201cOf course, everybody wants to watch Jannik [Sinner] against me in the semifinal or Jannik or me playing a final against Novak. \u201cI think that everybody is waiting for that moment, but it\u2019s a really long process, really long run. Let\u2019s see if I\u2019m going to be in this position.\u201d Super Spanish Sunday? Sunday, July 14 could mark a momentous day in the Spanish sporting calendar. Not only could we see Alcaraz representing his country in a second consecutive Wimbledon men\u2019s singles final, but his countrymen could also be in a position to vie for the Euro 2024 title in the final in Berlin. It would top off what\u2019s been an extraordinarily successful month and a half in both sporting circles for the Spaniard. Alcaraz\u2019s soccer summer got off to the perfect start with his club Real Madrid winning a record-extending 15th European cup with a 2-0 victory over Borussia Dortmund. That was followed a little over a week later with a maiden French Open title on the clay courts of Paris and confirmation soon after that the young star will join forces with Nadal in a dream doubles partnership at this month\u2019s Paris Olympic Games. \u201cIt has been a really good month for me,\u201d he smiles. \u201cAs a Real Madrid fan, I was watching in Paris [during the French Open]. That run at Roland Garros was unbelievable for me. Really happy for me. A dream come true. \u201cI\u2019m really, really happy with everything that I\u2019m living right now. \u201c[So] it could be awesome. Same day, me playing in a final in Wimbledon, Spain playing a Euros final. It could be a great moment for Spain, for our country. \u201cI trust in the Spanish national team and I believe [in] myself as well.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/sport/carlos-alcaraz-wimbledon-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_sport_paris-olympics-seine-triathlon-bacteria-intl", "text": "A reference point for Parisians and tourists alike, the River Seine will be the crown jewel of the Olympics this summer, staging events such as the triathlon as well as the opening ceremony, which for the first time in Olympic history will not be taking place in a stadium. Starting at Pont Alexandre III Bridge, the individual triathlon races are set to begin with a 1.5-kilometer swim, followed by a 40K bike race \u2013 passing by the Le Grand Palais and Champs-Elys\u00e9es \u2013 before finishing with a 10K run through the heart of the city. A mixed team relay race involving four athletes \u2013 two men and two women \u2013 will also start at Pont Alexandre III Bridge with each team member completing a 300-meter swim, followed by a 5.8K bike ride and 1.8K run. If all goes to plan, it will be a historic moment, given that swimming in the Seine has been illegal for more than 100 years due to the river\u2019s pollution levels, though some swimming has been permitted recently as part of triathlon test events. But some are warning that there are still potential dangers lurking below the river\u2019s shimmery surface. Recent testing results shared with CNN by technology company Fluidion show that the Seine is still not safe for swimming as per the standards set by World Triathlon, due to high E. Coli bacteria levels in the water, potentially exposing athletes to serious health risks. Authorities have spent at least \u20ac1.4 billion ($1.55 billion) to clean up the Seine. Last month, a rainwater storage facility was opened that can hold 20 Olympic swimming pools worth of water to reduce pressure on the sewage network and lower the risk of wastewater being discharged into the Seine, according to a statement from Paris 2024. Meanwhile, triathlon teams around the world are preparing for the worst and hoping for the best. \u201cFor me, it will be very frustrating and very shaming for France, Paris and the Olympics if we can\u2019t do a triathlon,\u201d French-born triathlete Jeanne Lehair told CNN in a telephone interview. What does the latest testing show? The city of Paris is working with its own laboratory to monitor the Olympic Seine site, but technology company Fluidion, founded in Paris in 2012, has also been checking the water quality of the river several times a week at Pont Alexandre III Bridge. The Seine serves as Fluidion\u2019s primary research site, according to the company, hence why they routinely collect water samples for internal research efforts. CNN has not independently verified the organization\u2019s findings. Fluidion\u2019s testing has found that, on average, E. Coli levels in the Siene between early April\u00a0and late May were just under 3400 MPN/100mL. According to CNN\u2019s calculation, this is more than three times higher than the level needed for \u201cgood\u201d water quality, as per World Triathlon standards. \u201cWe have experienced a very rainy past couple of months, causing numerous combined sewer overflows in Paris and upstream,\u201d Dan Angelescu, CEO of Fluidion, told CNN on May 31 via email, adding that the impact on water quality is evident, with \u201cnoticeable bacterial spikes following storm events.\u201d Nearly all of France has seen 120 to 200% of normal rainfall over the past three months, with numerous episodes of flooding across portions of the country, especially the north, according to M\u00e9t\u00e9o France. The highest E. Coli levels recorded by Fluidion were 23590 MPN/100mL on May 2 and 13090 MPN/100mL on May 30, according to Angelescu. The May 2 result is more than 20 times higher than World Triathlon\u2019s \u201cgood quality\u201d level, according to CNN\u2019s calculation. More recently, following several days of dry and sunny weather, E. Coli levels on Monday 6 June were 2280 MPN/100mL, according to Angelescu, better than previous results but still above acceptable levels for swimming. If E. Coli levels remain this high, the swimming leg of the triathlon will have to be cancelled, according to World Triathlon competition rules, unless the organization\u2019s medical committee decides that the race can go ahead. Does Paris 2024 have a plan B? Earlier in June, World Triathlon told CNN in an email that the first contingency plan would be to delay the race by one day. But if poor water quality persisted, the triathlon would have to be downgraded to a duathlon with no swimming, the organization confirmed. Angelescu said that while E. Coli is not typically pathogenic itself, it can indicate the presence of other pathogens, which can cause skin rashes, diarrhea, serious gastrointestinal diseases and, in very rare cases, even death. However, Angelescu said that the water quality of the Seine is likely to improve significantly before July due to drier and sunnier summer conditions, which will reduce the frequency of sewage spills. \u201cIt is highly speculative and scientifically unsound to project any conclusions about water quality during the Games based on recent trends,\u201d he said. Angelescu said that \u201csignificant infrastructure projects\u201d by the city of Paris designed to improve water quality will have a \u201csubstantial\u201d impact. \u201cThese tanks are expected to become operational before the Games, potentially becoming a \u2026 Games changer,\u201d added Angelescu. \u201cWhen our instruments and data indicate that the water quality is good, we will be the first to dive in, headfirst!\u201d Angelescu\u2019s tone of optimism isn\u2019t universally shared. French charity Surfrider Foundation Europe warned in April that they were \u201cgenuinely concerned about the health of athletes\u201d after only one of the 14 samples collected by the organization indicated a satisfactory standard of water quality for swimming. Two months later, the charity told CNN that they have since taken five additional samples, with E. coli levels remaining \u201csystematically above the guide values.\u201d CNN has not independently verified the charity\u2019s findings. How has Paris 2024 responded to these findings? Paris 2024 said they still have \u201cgreat confidence\u201d in the city of Paris to improve water quality to the \u201cnecessary standard\u201d in time for the Games. \u201cGenerally, water quality in the Seine continues to improve every day,\u201d they said in a statement to CNN in early June. \u201cBy the time of the Games, bacteriological pollution in the Seine will have been reduced by 75% thanks to the range of actions undertaken by our partners.\u201d In a statement to CNN, the city of Paris said that recent grey and rainy conditions have had a \u201cmajor impact\u201d on the Seine\u2019s water quality. A lack of sunlight \u2013 which would normally help to kill bacteria \u2013 has also contributed to the poor quality, they said earlier this month. They added: \u201cIt is only when summer conditions (strong sunshine, high temperatures, prolonged absence of rain) become established that the Seine will gradually return to its \u2018summer\u2019 appearance, and that we will see a gradual and significant improvement in water quality.\u201d Following multiple days of sunny weather in the first week of June,\u00a0E. Coli\u00a0levels improved near Pont Alexandre III Bridge, according to official data from the city of Paris shared with CNN, but whether the good weather will last remains to be seen. No precipitation trend, higher or lower than average, has been\u00a0predicted\u00a0for areas around Paris for the summer. Since June 1,\u00a0E. Coli\u00a0levels declined from around 7000 UFC/100mL (equivalent units to MPN/100mL, according to World Triathlon) to just below 1000 UFC/100mL on June 9, according to official data. However, World Triathlon\u2019s\u00a0Competition Rules\u00a02024 say that these levels are still too high for swimming, unless the organization\u2019s medical committee decides that the race can go ahead. Disinfectant and probiotics The threat that E. Coli and other bacteria pose is nothing new to triathlon teams. Over the last decade, water quality issues have been increasingly encountered, according to Mike Cavendish, Director of Performance at British Triathlon, who outlined preventative measures British athletes will be taking to ensure their health during Paris 2024. \u201cDisinfectant sounds like a really basic thing but it\u2019s something we will be doing a lot of, making sure that athletes are clean, that their equipment is clean,\u201d Cavendish told CNN in a telephone interview. Probiotic yogurts can also help to improve gut health, Cavenish added. Phil Dunne, Triathlon Canada\u2019s High Performance Director, said in a statement to CNN that their athletes are being supported by \u201ca team of physicians and dietitians\u201d to reduce the risk of becoming sick due to \u201ccompromised\u201d water quality. Tim Harradine, CEO of AusTriathlon, said that triathletes are used to dealing with the \u201cchanging nature\u201d of waterways. \u201cSometimes they race in the rain, sometimes they race in the heat,\u201d Harradine told CNN in a telephone interview, adding that athlete health will always come first. Lehair, who recently changed her nationality in time to represent Luxembourg at Paris 2024, told CNN that she understands why precautions need to be taken, but didn\u2019t seem altogether convinced by the effectiveness of measures like probiotics. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be good for the body anyway, so maybe you can have a try but it\u2019s not 100% sure that you won\u2019t get sick if you take probiotics,\u201d she said. \u201cAt least maybe you are stressing a bit less on the day of the race.\u201d \u2018Better quality of water is good for everyone\u2019 Paris 2024 isn\u2019t the first sporting event to contend with water quality issues. In March, concerns were raised after E. coli bacteria was discovered in London\u2019s River Thames ahead of the historic Oxford and Cambridge boat race. Also, in 2016, drug-resistant superbugs from hospital sewage were found in Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Guanabara Bay. Lehair is pleased that the authorities are attempting to clean up the river, but just wishes it had happened sooner. \u201cThey should have done this much before, just for the quality of the water in general and for the people, for the city,\u201d she said. \u201cBetter quality of water is good for everyone.\u201d Cavendish said that if the authorities\u2019 clean-up efforts in Paris prove successful, other countries could be encouraged to follow suit. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIf they pull this off and it looks fantastic, and they get a swim for the Olympics and the Paralympics \u2026 it puts pressure on other governments around the world, including our own, to try and make sure that we get safe swimming,\u201d said Cavendish. Harradine echoed that sentiment: \u201cIt\u2019s a very visible race venue and what a great legacy it could leave if this works well for the city.\u201d And if the worst comes to the worst and the impact of rain on water quality does threaten the triathlon races Cavendish is confident that the right call will be made. \u201cThe eyes of the world are on this race so I think you can guarantee that they (Paris 2024 and World Triathlon) will be putting all the right people in the room to make the right decision,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_07_02_sport_copa-america-photos-fans-cec", "text": "Their exuberant voices flooded New York\u2019s Times Square. Children sat on shoulders, hands raised; others jumped to the beat of their national songs. Their sky-blue-and-white striped jerseys cascaded through the streets, their matching flags waving overhead. Argentina, and beloved captain Lionel Messi, were playing later that day in New Jersey as part of Copa Am\u00e9rica, the soccer tournament featuring countries from North and South America. And everyone \u2014 Argentine or not, soccer fan or not \u2014 seemed to know about it. The US Men\u2019s National Team had a disappointing showing in the tournament, losing 1-0 Monday night to Uruguay and failing to advance to the knockout stage. But if Copa 2024 truly is a dress rehearsal for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which the US will co-host with Canada and Mexico, enthusiasm for this summer\u2019s event has shown the United States is more than ready. Fans have broken attendance records, both for matches involving the US Men\u2019s National Team and for other countries. In the crowds outside stadiums, in the jersey-clad bodies packed into bars, in the small talk around offices \u2014 the 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica is smashed any ideas that US is not a soccer country. When the US first hosted Copa Am\u00e9rica, back in 2016, soccer still seemed like a new frontier in American sports. That tournament, fresh off the 2014 World Cup, was hailed as a success; the USMNT\u2019s group stage matches attracted an average of about 1.5 million viewers. The 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica has already rendered those records obsolete, doubling the viewership for US matches in some cases. This year\u2019s tournament, which ends July 14, isn\u2019t even halfway over, and the most exciting part \u2014 the knockout stage \u2014 has yet to begin. Still, Americans have been watching in record numbers. The USMNT\u2019s opening game against Bolivia drew 3.2 million viewers, according to Fox Sports, becoming the network\u2019s most watched non-World Cup soccer broadcast ever. In 2016, those numbers would have been mind-boggling. By some measures, the mammoth success of the US Women\u2019s National Team and the National Women\u2019s Soccer League, considered by some to be the best women\u2019s soccer league in the world, has created an environment for soccer to flourish in America. Women\u2019s soccer has long found talent, investment and fans stateside, while other countries have mainly played catch-up. And soccer has long been a popular sport among America\u2019s youth. \u201cThe rest of the world says America isn\u2019t interested in soccer. I\u2019m not so sure,\u201d David Beckham wrote in his 2004 autobiography \u201cBeckham: Both Feet on the Ground.\u201d \u201cEvery time I visit, I see kids playing in parks and on school and college campuses everywhere. \u2026 There\u2019s a buzz around soccer in the States that points toward a very exciting future.\u201d Twenty years later, this year\u2019s Copa Am\u00e9rica success proves Beckham\u2019s words are ringing true. The hype extends past viewership and into attendance. In 2016, the US\u2019 game against Costa Rica in the group stage drew 39,642 people to Chicago\u2019s Soldier Field \u2014 leaving the stadium less than two-thirds full. Last week, 59,145 people packed Mercedes Benz Stadium in Atlanta to watch the USMNT battle Panama, creating an environment so raucous that their explosion of cheers could be heard from outside the venue. Nathan Miller, a 28-year-old PhD candidate at Georgia Tech, attended that game against Panama. He\u2019s been a fan of the US team since 2010, he told CNN, but this was his first time seeing them play live. Miller grew up playing soccer \u2014 his whole family did \u2014 but until recently he didn\u2019t know many people who actually watched the sport. \u201cI think it\u2019s a ground-up thing, where if MLS continues to grow, which it has been, and pulling international stars like Lionel Messi, I think that\u2019s going to be something that drums up more American soccer fans in general,\u201d he said. Miller remembers those 2016 Copa America matches. At the time, he and a group of friends would go to a Buffalo Wild Wings to watch the US play \u2014 sometimes needing to ask the restaurant to put the matches on the TVs. Now, he said, a bar by his apartment complex has signs with the US Soccer logo on it. And the Mexican restaurant next door has been advertising drink deals during Copa matches. \u201cI think it\u2019d be harder now to find a place that wasn\u2019t showing the game, as compared to back then,\u201d he said. The growing diversity of the US population may be helping boost soccer in the country as more immigrants arrive with a deep passion for the sport, Miller said. Even so, smaller countries still have a harder time drawing crowds. When Ecuador faced Jamaica on June 26 in Las Vegas, Allegiant Stadium was less than half full. Just 15,000 fans came out to see Peru play Canada in Kansas City. By contrast, when powerhouse Argentina played rival Chile last week in New Jersey\u2019s MetLife Stadium, more than 80,000 fans came to watch. Many of them had been carousing in Times Square only hours earlier. Still, US fan interest is growing, and the 2024 Copa America may be another key step in its evolution. In two years World Cup matches will be played in 11 US cities, from Seattle to Miami \u2014 an event that will bring in thousands of fans from around the world and infuse the US with even more interest in the beautiful game. The 2026 World Cup final will be played at MetLife Stadium outside New York City. If defending champion Argentina reaches the title match, Times Square may once again become a roiling sea of blue and white.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/sport/copa-america-photos-fans-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_sport_jesse-owens-grandson-1936-olympics-berlin-spt-intl", "text": "American Jesse Owens\u2019 achievements at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin \u2013 he won four gold medals in the 100 meters, the 200m, the 4x100m relay and the long jump \u2013 made him a track and field great. Those achievements came under the gaze of Adolf Hitler, who had initially planned for the Olympics held in Nazi Germany to showcase what he believed to be the racial superiority of\u00a0White, so-called \u201cAryan\u201d\u00a0athletes, openly denigrating Black American participants as \u201cnon-humans.\u201d The image of Owens \u2013 one of 18 Black athletes on the US team \u2013 atop the podium and surrounded by individuals giving the Nazi salute\u00a0has become part of Olympic lore. Owens\u2019 grandson Stuart Owen Rankin describes the track and field great\u2019s actions as a \u201cthumb in the eye\u201d to Hitler. \u201cMy grandfather\u2019s legacy continues to prosper. When people do find out and it\u2019s not often that I discuss it outwardly, but people do eventually find out, for example, perhaps through watching interviews like this, their response is always positive,\u201d Rankin told CNN\u2019s Don Riddell. \u201cTheir response is one that fills me with pride. Again, their response speaks to my grandfather\u2019s accomplishments and the enduring quality of what he did in \u201836 and sort of the timelessness of those accomplishments.\u201d \u2018A bond, a brotherhood, a connection\u2019 Another enduring memory from the 1936 Games was Owens\u2019\u00a0connection with the German long-jumper Luz Long. Owens and Long were seen as the two favorites to compete for the gold medal in the long jump at the Berlin Games. The two men came from very different backgrounds. Owens was a Black American and Long was a White German living in Nazi Germany. Given the circumstances of the 1936 Olympics, a level of hostility might have been expected between the long jumpers. In fact, the opposite was true. According to Rankin,\u00a0Owens said Long offered him advice\u00a0on how to not overstep, which was an issue the US athlete was having in the long jump qualifying competition. Following Long\u2019s advice, Owens\u00a0said he\u00a0put down a towel at a mark to help him perfect his run-up and in doing so, the American was able to successfully book his spot in the long-jump final. Owens went on to claim gold, while Long secured the silver. \u201cIt took a lot of courage for [Long] to befriend me in front of Hitler,\u201d Owens later said of his friendship with Long. \u201cYou can melt down all the medals and cups I have and they wouldn\u2019t be a plating on the 24-carat friendship I felt for Long at that moment.\u201d Rankin says the two became \u201ccomrades, became allies, became friends\u201d by pushing themselves to greater heights. \u201cWhat came from that was a bond, a brotherhood, a connection between two world class athletes on the highest stage of their particular event or sport.\u201d Long was killed fighting for Nazi Germany in World War II, but the families of the Americn and German still remain in contact, bonded through their grandfathers\u2019 friendship, according to Rankin. Owens\u2019 grandson recalls traveling to Munich for business and a colleague, upon finding out who his grandfather was, asked if he knew who Long was. Once they had established that he did, Rankin\u2019s colleague scrolled through his contacts\u2019 list and found the name Julia Long,\u00a0the German long jumper\u2019s granddaughter. Through that connection, Rankin and Long\u2019s granddaughter met for dinner, an evening he describes as a \u201cvery special meal, a very special conversation.\u201d \u201cWe both spoke to what it was like to be the grandchild of an Olympian, particularly an Olympian from those Games and particularly our respective grandfathers and only Julia could speak to what it\u2019s like in a way that\u2019s similar to how I could speak to what it\u2019s like,\u201d remembers Rankin. \u201cAnd so, we of course bonded over that. We talked about our personal interests that are likely to have been influenced by our grandfathers, our interests in outdoors and physicality and sports. So it was, it was a very special time and a very special conversation and the connection continues on today.\u201d Strides After the Berlin Games,\u00a0widespread, institutionalized racism and segregation in the US\u00a0meant Owens\u2019\u00a0achievements weren\u2019t fully appreciated\u00a0when he returned home. Although the then-22-year-old Owens did receive a New York ticker tape parade, he was forced to ride in a freight elevator to a reception in his honor at the Waldorf Astoria\u00a0hotel. \u201cAlthough I wasn\u2019t invited to shake hands with Hitler,\u201d Owens said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t invited to the White House to shake hands with the President, either.\u201d Owens also failed to attract the endorsements and sponsorship deals enjoyed by White athletes, and was reduced to running exhibition races against\u00a0motorbikes and\u00a0horses to make ends meet. It was not until the 1950s, 20 years after his Berlin triumph, that he finally achieved a measure of financial security, opening a public relations firm and becoming a highly successful public speaker. Owens later received the two highest civilian honors the US can bestow. In 1976, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Gerald Ford,\u00a0and in 1990, a decade after his death from lung cancer, President George\u00a0H.W.\u00a0Bush\u00a0presented his widow\u00a0a posthumous Congressional\u00a0Gold Medal. In perhaps the most fitting memorial to his achievements, a street in Berlin was renamed in his honor in 1984. Asked what the reception would be for Owens upon his return to the US had he achieved his feats in 2024, Rankin\u00a0says\u00a0his grandfather would \u201crecognize \u2026 almost immeasurable strides in progress in terms of race relations here within the United States.\u201d However, Rankin added that there are \u201cstill people, many people, people in power, people in positions of authority that hold onto that mindset of 1930s America. \u201cAnd I think that it would not be lost on him, that we still have a long way to go when it comes to many people\u2019s mindsets towards people who are different from them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/sport/jesse-owens-grandson-1936-olympics-berlin-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_sport_ukraine-russia-olympics-iryna-kolyadenko-intl-spt", "text": "As she hits the mats in a large, bright gym in a recreational area near Kyiv, the ongoing war with Russia is very much on Ukrainian wrestler Iryna Kolyadenko\u2019s mind. Amid thousands of\u00a0civilian casualties and as the war grinds on, Ukrainians like Kolyadenko competing at the Paris Olympics face an existential challenge as much as an athletic one. The 25-year-old is no stranger to the physical demands of training but for the first Olympics since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the one-time bronze medal winner is upping her mental game in anticipation of squaring off against Russian athletes. \u201cI consider it my mission to prevent them from getting on the podium,\u201d Kolyadenko told CNN. \u201cIf I show my emotions, demonstrate them, it will prevent me from winning \u2026 but, of course, there will be no handshakes,\u201d she said. Russians and Belarusians will be participating in the games as Individual Neutral Athletes and that means Ukrainian athletes could end up facing off against them. Ukraine\u2019s sports ministry has issued guidelines for their athletes competing at the upcoming Games in Paris including refraining from joint photos, press conferences, and events with Russian and Belarusian athletes, not commenting on social media, keeping a distance from them during award ceremonies, and much more. Acting Sports Minister Matviy Bidnyi told CNN that the reason for the recommendations was several incidents that have already occurred at competitions of various levels ahead of the Olympics, including the refusal to shake hands with a Russian athlete at the world championships, which resulted in disqualification for fencer Olga Kharlan. According to the Ukrainian Ministry of Sport, discussions were held with international federations in various sports over its athletes not wanting to shake hands with Russian and Belarusian athletes at the Paris Olympics. As a result, the international federations decided that Ukrainian athletes wouldn\u2019t be disqualified for not shaking hands with individual neutral athletes. For Kolyadenko, shaking hands with Russian and Belarusian athletes is a no-go. \u201cThe Russian military destroyed my apartment, the Russian military is destroying my life, the lives of my family and the whole country, how can I treat them? Of course, negatively. I don\u2019t want Russians to take part in the competition at all. This is unacceptable,\u201d she said. When Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Kolyadenko was at the gym in Kyiv where she now is training for the Paris Games. \u201cThat day, we were supposed to fly to Turkey for a competition, but at 4 a.m. we woke up hearing explosions. Of course, I was totally confused and didn\u2019t know what to do. \u201cBut then I gathered my thoughts, packed my things and went to Irpin \u2026 At that time, I did not understand what had happened,\u201d adds Kolyadenko as she recalled traveling to Dymtrivka village to be with her grandmother, aunt and sister. Three days later, she says, dozens of Russian military vehicles entered Irpin. Residential areas were shelled, and civilians were killed. The village where Kolyadenko and her family were staying, was under constant shelling. The family moved to the basement. One day, when Kolyadenko went upstairs to get her stuff, she says, the wrestler saw through her window there were Russian troops rappelling down a ladder from a helicopter. Running out of food, and with no water or gas, and no medicines being delivered and little prospect of evacuation, Kolyadenko and her relatives left the village \u201cIt was already very dangerous,\u201d said Kolyadenko. \u201cOn the roadsides there were shot up cars where people had been killed.\u201d Kolyadenko spent more than a day driving with her family and relatives. She says she didn\u2019t think about sports or training at all, because she didn\u2019t know if they would survive. \u2018We had no choice.. because our families were there\u2019 Kolyadenko was not the only one to experience such a life-threatening situation. The head coach of the women\u2019s wrestling team, Volodymyr Evonov, also encountered Russian troops at the base near Kyiv. Almost immediately, he left for his family in Kherson, even though there was already information that convoys of Russian heavy vehicles were heading towards the city from annexed Crimea. \u201cWe traveled to meet the war. We had no choice. On the way, we saw our military digging trenches. They told us not to go there. We went anyway. Because our families were there,\u201d Evonov told CNN as he recalled those first days of invasion. A week later, the Russians entered Kherson. Local residents resisted them, took to the streets with posters and flags to stop Russian tanks, and organized pro-Ukrainian rallies in the city\u2019s central square until repression began against the activists. The athletes had their own form of protest \u2013 they continued to train. \u201cWe trained regularly and waited for our military to release us,\u201d added Evonov. \u201cA month passed in this expectation. It was getting harder and harder. We got together with our coaches, took some of the athletes and our families and in mid-April (2022) we took advantage of the window of opportunity and managed to leave.\u201d After Evonov and his colleagues left their hometown, Kherson remained under occupation until the city was liberated in 2022, though it remains under constant shelling. It is no longer possible to continue training there, according to Evonov. Just a month after the war began, the women\u2019s national wrestling team was able to gather for a joint training session at the Olympic center of the Hungarian team in Tata. The Ukraine women\u2019s team was then invited to live and train in a safe environment by their Japanese colleagues, where they spent a fortnight in June 2023. The Ukraine women\u2019s team also spent another two months in the US, where they were hosted by local universities. These days, the women have returned to regular training at their base near Kyiv. They have endured blackouts caused by Russian targeting of electricity infrastructure and spent sleepless nights as missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles hit the city. While Kyiv is much better protected these days the war shows no sign of ending. Difficult training conditions The conditions under which the athletes have prepared for the Paris Olympics affected the team\u2019s results. At the Tokyo Olympics, the women\u2019s wrestling team won five licenses. This year, only two athletes \u2013 Kolyadenko and Oksana Livach \u2013 will go to Paris. According to Bidnyi, more than 100 athletes will represent the Ukrainian national team in Paris. Given the conditions in which they have been preparing for the Olympics over the past two years, the Ministry of Sports of Ukraine says this number of athletes competing is quite positive given that there is a war going on. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that during the aggression, when, for example, Russia caused a blackout last winter, it was very difficult to train,\u201d said Bidnyi. \u201cThe temperature in the halls sometimes dropped so much that we had to train in our outerwear. Another example is that our synchronized swimmers train in a pool in Kharkiv, which actually has a hole in the roof because a missile hit it. It is clear that these are not the conditions that can be called normal,\u201d added Bidnyi. Over 500 sports infrastructure facilities have been destroyed since the full-scale invasion, according to Bidnyi. These are the ones located on the territory controlled by Ukraine. There is no verified information about the destroyed infrastructure facilities in the occupied part. \u201cThere are athletes whose loved ones and parents are at constant risk,\u201d said Bidnyi. \u201cSomeone\u2019s relatives are serving on the frontline today, and the athletes are worried about them. \u201cSome of our athletes have lost their parents, who lived a peaceful life until a missile hit their home. There are a lot of such stories. Some lost their homes, some lost their loved ones,\u201d adds Bidnyi. For Kolyadenko, getting a license and preparing for the Paris Olympics was more difficult than for any other competition in her career. Given the uncertainty in Ukraine, she says she cannot plan her professional life after the Olympics. For now, here only goal is do her country proud.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/sport/ukraine-russia-olympics-iryna-kolyadenko-intl-spt/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Cody Gakpo opened the scoring for the Netherlands in Munich with a powerful finish midway through the first half as he continued his impressive goalscoring form at the tournament. It was the Liverpool forward\u2019s third goal of Euro 2024. The Dutch had multiple opportunities to double its lead but were wasteful in front of goal until Gakpo produced a magical run to set up Donyell Malen for the Netherlands\u2019 second. It was Malen who scored the third Dutch goal in added time, running clear before finding the net with a low shot. The Netherlands will play Turkey in the quarterfinals after its 2-1 win over Austria in Leipzig later on Tuesday. A convincing performance Monday\u2019s game was played in Munich\u2019s Allianz Arena, a ground which is approximately six miles away from the city\u2019s former main stadium. The Olympic Stadium staged two of the most famous moments in Dutch football history \u2013 the Netherlands\u2019 loss to West Germany in the 1974 World Cup final and when it won the 1988 Euros. Having been beaten by Austria in its final group game in Berlin, the Netherlands were a different proposition in Munich on Tuesday, perhaps channeling some of that historical success in the Bavarian capital. Gakpo opening the scoring with a wonderful solo goal, picking the ball up wide on the left before driving into the Romania box and blasting past Florin Ni\u021b\u0103 at his near post. The goal makes him the joint-top goalscorer at the tournament alongside Georgia\u2019s Georges Mikautadze, Jamal Musiala of Germany and Slovakia\u2019s Ivan Schranz. Ronald Koeman\u2019s side came close to doubling its lead minutes later, but Stefan de Vrij\u2019s header from close range found the side-netting of the Romania goal. The Oranje was completely on top after Gakpo\u2019s goal, dominating possession and producing some confident passing play to torment the Romanian defense. Xavi Simons was the next to come close but his effort from a good position dribbled harmlessly wide. Although Romania \u2013 playing in the knockout stages of a European Championships for just the second time and first since 2000 \u2013 grew into the first half, Edward Iord\u0103nescu\u2019s side was unable to trouble Dutch goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen before the interval. The Dutch dominated the second half. Memphis Depay looked like he could just tap into the net from close range, only for Andrei Ra\u021biu to produce a brilliant defensive challenge. Minutes later, the Dutch captain, Virgil van Dijk, hit the post with a header from a corner. Gakpo continued to torment the Romanian defense, and he thought he had doubled the Netherlands\u2019 lead when he slammed home from close range only for the video assistant referee (VAR) to rule the goal out for offside. The Netherlands finally got that second goal in the 83rd minute when Gakpo managed to keep the ball in play on the byline. The 25-year-old then cleverly pulled the ball back for Malen, who slammed home for his first goal of the tournament. Things got even better for Malen in the final seconds of the game, as he got his second goal of the game by finishing off a swift counterattack.

{"id": "2023_02_05_sport_head-injury-suicide-female-athletes-intl-spt-cmd", "text": "Kelly Catlin and Ellie Soutter never met, but they had a lot in common.  Both were commanding athletes: Catlin, a US track cyclist, was a three-times world champion and Olympic silver medalist, and Soutter, a snowboarder, was tipped to be one of Team Great Britain\u2019s strongest contenders for the 2022 Winter Olympics, having already won a bronze medal at the 2017 European Youth Olympic Festival.  Both were incredibly smart \u2013 Catlin was studying for a master\u2019s degree in computational and mathematical engineering at Stanford University, while Soutter learned to speak French in about six months, according to her father.   At times they almost seemed superhuman. In 2013, after only three weeks of formal training and having broken her wrist, Soutter became British Champion with her arm in a cast. Meanwhile, Catlin, who had a tenderness for children, once rode 80 miles through sleet and snow to speak to a grade school about her Olympic experience.    Yet these two women\u2019s lives were tragically cut short after they sustained serious head injuries in their pursuit of sporting greatness and then took their own lives. Catlin was 23, while Soutter died by suicide on her 18th birthday.  Females may be more susceptible to concussion, and they also have worse and prolonged symptoms after their injury than men, according to a review of 25 studies of sport-related concussion published in the Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine.  However, women remain significantly underrepresented within sport and exercise science research. This, leading experts warn, means they often do not get the treatment or aftercare they need following a head injury.  Women\u2019s sports have historically not received the same attention or funding as men\u2019s sports, Dr. Ann McKee, Director of the Boston University Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s been shown that women athletes are more likely to get a concussion, they tend to have longer recovery periods,\u201d McKee added. \u201cWe do not have enough information about what happens in the female brain. We don\u2019t know if women are biologically more susceptible to these injuries,\u201d she said, adding that some research suggests the size and musculature of women\u2019s necks could play a part. Kelly  Before becoming a track cyclist, Catlin, a triplet, was a national champion road cyclist and time trial national champion, her father Mark, told CNN. After winning a Canadian international race at 17 she was invited to an Olympic training camp for a try out, where, impressed by her performance numbers, coaches immediately offered her a position on the track pursuit team.  Catlin\u2019s father, Mark, told CNN, that his daughter was \u201cintense\u201d and \u201cambitious,\u201d attributes she channeled into her sporting life. Her life changed irrevocably in January 2019. Practicing fast downhill descents in the hills near Los Angeles, she crashed and went skidding down the road.  Despite suffering road rash, Catlin got back on her bike, and finished the ride. It wasn\u2019t her first crash \u2013 she had experienced 4 or 5 hard crashes before this, her father said, and after the latest, she didn\u2019t have any symptoms at the time.  But soon after, at a World Cup track event in Berlin, Catlin was gripped by a sudden and severe headache.   \u201cShe couldn\u2019t compete,\u201d her father said. \u201cKelly is kind of this stoical individual. And if she\u2019s rolling around on the ground, clutching her head, it has to be a severe thing.\u201d On closer inspection, Catlin\u2019s helmet from LA had dents in it. Her father told CNN that this, coupled with her symptoms, caused her family to become aware she had suffered a concussion, which was later confirmed with a diagnosis from Stanford\u2019s Health Centre.  A concussion is a brain injury which happens after a hit to the head or body causes the brain to move back and forth inside the skull, according to the CDC. When Catlin returned to the US, her father says she was examined by the track training center in Colorado. It was confirmed she suffered a concussion, and a return to training protocol was advised, but not implemented or communicated to her coach, he said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any follow-up from Colorado after this. I believe they assumed she would seek care at Stanford,\u201d he told CNN.  CNN has reached out to Stanford and USA Cycling for comment.  Catlin\u2019s symptoms didn\u2019t improve, and in weekly phone calls with her parents, she admitted she was struggling with schoolwork and was unable to concentrate. Stanford Health Center, having diagnosed Catlin with concussion with ongoing symptoms, recommended that she decrease her training for 2 weeks and then gradually build back up and start sessions with an athletic trainer, medical documents sent to CNN by her father show. She was referred to a concussion specialist, the document adds. She tried to train, but \u201cshe would have to stop because she got a severe headache just from walking,\u201d according to her father. Her heart rate would also accelerate rapidly from even the smallest exertion, leaving her with \u201cno exercise tolerance whatsoever,\u201d he added.  Her injury had other consequences. \u201cAs far as we knew she was never a person that suffered from depression. She had an interesting sense of humor.  She was always upbeat and bubbly about things,\u201d her father told CNN.  \u201cShe basically thought her life was over. She was no longer able to be the athlete that she was, she was failing her teammates. And she wasn\u2019t able to succeed in school now. And I think ultimately, that\u2019s why she took her life, because she thought her life was over,\u201d he added.  At the end of January, Catlin made a serious but non-fatal suicide attempt, and was involuntarily admitted to the locked psychiatric ward at Stanford, her father told CNN. A month after that attempt, she took her own life.     Ellie   Soutter\u2019s father Tony said there were many dimensions to his young daughter \u2013 not only was she an \u201cadrenaline junkie,\u201d but she was \u201cvery conscientious\u201d and excelled in school, even after moving from England to France.   Aged 12, Soutter took up snowboarding at school \u2013 and just months later, she was spotted in her hometown resort of Les Gets and trialed by Team Great Britain in February 2013.  \u201cIt was quite obvious why she kept winning competitions because she just made it easy,\u201d her father said. \u201cShe just made it look graceful and beautiful.\u201d But training took its toll \u2013 Soutter told CNN that his daughter suffered seven major concussions in five years, between 2013 and 2018.  \u201cI was being advised by doctors \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, she\u2019s young enough she\u2019ll bounce back. As she progressed, becoming an elite athlete starting on the World Cup circuit, every time she had another concussion, they got worse, and they took longer to recover from,\u201d he told CNN.     \u201cWith every concussion, with the exception of a few minor knocks, Ellie saw a doctor in person,\u201d he added. \u201cI was always told that she was young enough to bounce back to full health after each case and therefore never consulted with the doctors that I met, about any previous concussions.\u201d But Soutter\u2019s final concussion was so \u201chuge\u201d that she spent two nights in the hospital. \u201cWhen I got there, she didn\u2019t even know who I was or where she was,\u201d her father said. Soutter was then selected for the Junior Snowboard World Championships in New Zealand August 2018.  But a month before the competition, she died by suicide.  Her father said a neurologist conducted a CT scan of her brain and reaction tests three months after her final concussion, but said she was \u201cabsolutely fine\u201d and could continue competing.                                                                                                                                 Like Catlin, Soutter had issues with studying and concentrating, becoming more insular as she suffered from crippling headaches. She also started suffering from insomnia.  \u201cShe would literally sit with the tutor a good month after a concussion, and suddenly, she\u2019d go blind. She\u2019d not be able to see \u2013 everything would go black and dark,\u201d her father said. After missing a flight to snowboard training, Soutter died by suicide on her 18th birthday. Team GB referred CNN to GB Snowsport when approached for comment, adding that Ellie only competed for Team GB at one event.  In order to represent Britain in international competitions, GB Snowsport says athletes or their coaches are required to demonstrate that the athlete has reached established performance criteria, is of the relevant technical ability to compete, and has appropriate medical clearance to compete. A large number of athletes can represent Britain at different levels of international competition but are not part of a programme delivered and overseen by GB Snowsport.  \u201cAs Ellie was not part of the GB Snowsport programme, we were unable to implement a personalised recovery and management programme for Ellie,\u201d a spokesperson for GB Snowsport told CNN in an email. \u201cShe was, however, covered by national policies and protocols around fitness to compete, and would not have been cleared for any activity \u2013 training or competition \u2013 overseen by GB Snowsport without being able to demonstrate appropriate medical sign-off,\u201d they added. The spokesperson for GB Snowsport told CNN: \u201cWe take concussions and head injuries incredibly seriously, and in reviewing contemporaneous records from the time that Ellie was involved in snowsport we are confident that GB Snowsport staff applied and followed every appropriate process.\u201d Catlin and Soutter aren\u2019t the only young sporting women whose lives have been cut short in this way. After 29-year-old Australian rules football player Jacinda Barclay took her life in 2020, post-mortem research by scientists found that she had degradation to her cerebral white matter unusual for someone her age.  \u201cFor someone her age, you would expect to see lovely pristine white matter, and hers looked like she was an old woman in that it was basically degraded,\u201d Michael Buckland, founder and Executive Director of the Australian Sports Brain Bank, who studied Barclay\u2019s brain, told CNN.  \u201cWe haven\u2019t gone back and done specific white matter studies on our donors,\u201d he told CNN, adding that the bank hasn\u2019t done peer reviewed research on this.  \u201cBut what struck me, just as someone that sees a lot of brains \u2013 this is not normal for someone of that age.\u201d  Damage to white matter has been associated with dementia, according to research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.   Opportunities missed Suicide after concussion is rare. However patients diagnosed with concussion or mild traumatic brain injury had double the risk of suicide and a higher risk of suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts than people without brain injuries, a 2018 study from researchers at the University of Harvard published in JAMA Neurology found. Dr. Robert Cantu, clinical professor of neurology at the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at Boston University School of Medicine told CNN that there are several theories as to why incidence of suicide is higher in people who have suffered concussion. One theory, he explained, is that those suffering from persistent post-concussion symptoms may have structural or functional brain damage and could be experiencing \u201cbehavioral dysregulation: short fuse, irritability, [and] can\u2019t suppress impulses the way you normally could.\u201d   With these emotional problems, \u201cthey would be more prone to perhaps do something impulsive, like commit suicide,\u201d Cantu, medical director of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, told CNN. A second theory, Cantu noted, is that post-concussive symptoms prevent people from getting back into their sport and stop them \u201cfrom being the person that they were before their injury.\u201d Neither theory is proven to the exclusion of the other, Cantu said, adding he thinks increased suicidality was \u201ca combined factor involving both in many, if not most cases.\u201d There are also differences in the way brain injuries affect women.  A study of female soccer players across US high schools found they are nearly twice as likely to suffer concussion as their male counterparts, according to research that looked at over 80,000 adolescent athletes, published in the journal JAMA Network Open.  Women remain significantly underrepresented within sport and exercise science research: a 2021 study examining papers from some of the most influential sports medical journals found that only 6% of the studies were solely focused on women, compared with 31% of studies that included just men. Other researchers have pointed to female sex hormones, with risk of concussion changing with hormone levels during a menstrual cycle.  McKee said all athletes can also experience \u201cnon-concussive\u201d injuries: \u201chits to the head that can be of the same magnitude as concussion, but they don\u2019t rise to the level of symptoms for whatever reason, so a player tends to play right through it.\u201d Cumulative exposure to repetitive head impacts \u2013 including concussion and non- concussive injuries \u2013 increases the risk for the neurodegenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known as CTE, McKee said.  The disease, which can only be formally diagnosed with an autopsy, has mostly been seen in either veterans or people who played contact sports, particularly American football, say researchers. The disease occurs when the brain starts to degenerate likely due to repeated head traumas, according to the Mayo Clinic, which notes CTE is \u201cassociated with recurrent concussions.\u201d But scientists aren\u2019t only concerned about concussions.  Previous studies have shown subconcussive head impacts \u2013 repetitive hits to the head and body that do not cause symptoms \u2013 can still result in long-term neurological disease.   According to The Concussion Legacy Foundation, \u201cthe best available evidence suggests that subconcussive impacts, not concussions, are the driving force behind CTE.\u201d There have been cases of CTE discovered in athletes who have never been diagnosed with a concussion, according to the Concussion Legacy Foundation. And other changes in the brain after repetitive head impacts aside from CTE are likely \u201cequally important,\u201d McKee said. \u201cWe also see damage to the white matter. And that appears to be mostly in the frontal lobe, but also in the temporal lobes,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to understand the relationship of those white matter changes to behavioral and mood symptoms, perhaps even suicidality,\u201d she said.  McKee stressed that concussion management is important, but physicians and athletes should also be aware of other injuries. \u201cThe problem is the subclinical hits \u2013 the non-concussive injuries that aren\u2019t detected, you don\u2019t pull the player off the field \u2013 and they can be in the hundreds or even the 1000s in a single season,\u201d she explained. Lack of research  Though a growing body of data suggests women in sport are more likely to sustain a concussion, have more severe symptoms, and to take longer to recover, most sports-related concussions protocols are based on data from men.  In a review in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers looked at 171 concussion studies written since 1967 which are used to inform the most influential consensus and position statements in treating sports-related concussions. Clinicians rely on these documents to guide their medical practice when treating athletes \u2013 but most of the studies are focused on men. Only 1% of them was looking exclusively at concussions in women and 40% of them didn\u2019t have any women in a sample of participants at all.   There is another risk factor for women in sport when they sustain head injuries, Katherine Snedaker, founder and executive director of PINK Concussions, a non-profit dedicated to women\u2019s health and brain injury, told CNN.  There is a gulf of millions of dollars separating women and men when it comes to average annual salaries in most professional sports. Outside of elite sport, Snedaker says, female athletes often don\u2019t have access to the same medical care as men, meaning head injuries aren\u2019t spotted as routinely.   \u201cThey tend to push really hard through the injury,\u201d she said. And many women can\u2019t afford to take time out to recover: even professional athletes will supplement their sports income with other jobs, she added, and many are caregivers. \u201cWhen they really crater, it\u2019s a couple of days or weeks later.\u201d  Snedaker said female athletes often weren\u2019t aware they had suffered a head injury. If they were, she said, there were no appropriate medical or sporting staff to inform. Not enough support The families of Catlin and Soutter feel the young women didn\u2019t get enough support after their injuries. After Catlin\u2019s first suicide attempt, she was released from an involuntary admission to the psychiatric ward after threatening legal action, and a conference between psychiatrists, her coach and her parents.  She attended therapy sessions, which she agreed to attend during the conference, but found \u201cthey were geared toward suicidal freshman with a whole set of different issues than an elite Olympic athlete,\u201d her father told CNN. She got a referral to a sports psychologist that worked with the Stanford athletic department, but the department forbade the psychologist from seeing Catlin because she was not a varsity athlete, her father added.  She contacted the office of a sports psychologist with whom she had developed a rapport while in the hospital \u2013 but, his appointment secretary said he had no openings for six months, her father told CNN.  \u201cWherever she turned she could not find help,\u201d he said, adding that his daughter tried a suicide hotline several times: she was once put on hold and once received no answer. Catlin described his daughter as a \u201cstoic, female warrior type person that isn\u2019t going to admit that she\u2019s struggling.\u201d  \u201cShe needed a sports psychiatrist that really could understand what she was going through and understand the rigors of her life in terms of preparation for competitions and the athletic side of it and what it could potentially do to you.\u201d Her father said a major factor in his daughter\u2019s death was \u201ca lack of communication between the facilities that were involved in Kelly\u2019s care. No one was in charge and they assumed the other institutions were following up when they weren\u2019t,\u201d he added. In a statement sent to CNN, Luisa Rapport, director of emergency communications and media relations at Stanford University did not address any of the specific allegations made by Catlin\u2019s family.  She said while the university does not discuss in the media the details of individual students\u2019 experiences, \u201csupporting the mental and emotional health of students is a critical priority for Stanford.\u201d  \u201cStudents in need of mental health crisis assistance \u2013 including students having suicidal thoughts \u2013 and those who are concerned about students in need of assistance, can contact the University\u2019s Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) 24 hours-a-day, seven days-a-week,\u201d she added. Rapport said that in addition to this, \u201cthere are multiple places where psychological services may be provided for students depending on individualized need and treatment recommendations, including, for example, affiliated hospital services and clinics through Stanford\u2019s Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, and mental health programs and clinicians in the community.\u201d In a statement sent to CNN, USA Cycling said it was \u201cdevastated\u201d by Catlin\u2019s death, adding: \u201cShe brought focus and determination to everything she did, and served as an inspiration to everyone who knew her.  \u201cAs the National Governing Body for the sport of cycling, USA Cycling prioritizes the holistic wellbeing of the riders on the U.S. National Team and has a longstanding commitment to providing both physical and mental health resources to members of the team,\u201d a representative for USA Cycling added.   After his daughter Ellie\u2019s death, Soutter was contacted by the UNITE Brain Bank, who wanted to study her brain as part of their research into CTE. But even in that facility \u2013 the biggest of its kind in the world \u2013 of some 1,300 brains, only 3% belonged to women, Ann McKee, Director of the Boston University Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center told CNN. \u201cWhen I actually started looking into CTE \u2013 all of the work that they\u2019ve done with the footballers in America, she had every single symptom and more,\u201d Soutter told CNN. \u201cIt was quite obvious to me that there was a definite link in her starting to get into dark places and feeling bad and anxious and not sleeping properly. All of those symptoms \u2026 Every one that\u2019s involved in CTE was part of Ellie\u2019s life,\u201d he added. \u201cI truly believe today that my daughter would be alive had I had any inkling, you know, even the smallest bit of information.\u201d Editor\u2019s Note: If you are in the US and you or a loved one have contemplated suicide, call The National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255) to connect with a trained counselor.

{"id": "2024_07_02_sport_klay-thompson-dallas-mavericks-golden-state-warriors-spt-intl", "text": "Free agent Klay Thompson has reportedly agreed to a three-year, $50 million deal with the Dallas Mavericks after confirming his departure from the Golden State Warriors, according to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and The Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania, citing unnamed sources. The move brings Thompson\u2019s 13-year tenure with the Warriors to an end, during which he was part of one of the sport\u2019s most dominant dynasties. The 34-year-old will head to Dallas to link up with All-Stars Luka Don\u010di\u0107 and Kyrie Irving, who are fresh off leading the team to the NBA Finals, where they were defeated in five games by the Boston Celtics. Thompson\u2019s deal is part of a sign-and-trade agreement with the Warriors and Mavericks, which will see Dallas send two second-round draft picks to Golden State, per Charania. CNN has reached out to the Mavericks for comment and confirmation of the reports. The Warriors confirmed Thompson\u2019s departure on Monday in a statement, thanking him for his contributions. \u201cWe can\u2019t overstate Klay Thompson\u2019s incredible and legendary contributions with the Warriors during his 13 years with the team, highlighted by four NBA Championships, six trips to the NBA Finals, five NBA All-Star Game appearances and several NBA records,\u201d the franchise wrote. \u201cHis penchant for delivering in pressurized situations on the biggest stage, including many Game 6 heroics, has helped define a career. Klay\u2019s legacy will live on forever and we look forward to the day we can retire his #11 jersey at Chase Center, where he will join a host of Warriors immortals, including those who helped shape this recent dynasty \u2013 himself included.\u201d Thompson was drafted 11th overall by Golden State in 2011. Over the next decade, he established a reputation as an elite two-way player and one of the best three-point shooters in the game, forming part of the sharpshooting \u201cSplash Brothers\u201d duo alongside backcourt partner Steph Curry. Former defensive player of year Draymond Green completed a fearsome trio, with the Warriors winning the NBA championship in 2015. After losing out to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals following the league\u2019s best ever regular season record in 2016, they were joined by former MVP Kevin Durant for the 2016/17 season, winning two more titles over the next two campaigns. Thompson suffered two major injury setbacks in recent years. He tore his anterior cruciate ligament during Golden State\u2019s loss to the Toronto Raptors in the 2019 NBA Finals, missing the entirety of the following season as a result. He was expected to return for the 2020/21 campaign but suffered an Achilles injury before the season got underway and was again sidelined for the entire year. He eventually made his return in January 2022, going on to win his fourth championship that season. A fractious final season with the Warriors where the team missed the playoffs entirely and Thompson\u2019s role waning led to his previously unthinkable departure becoming increasingly likely, per Wojnarowski. Thompson was benched last season for the first time since his rookie year and averaged 17.9 points per game, his lowest since 2013.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/sport/klay-thompson-dallas-mavericks-golden-state-warriors-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_sport_hyrox-meg-jacoby-celia-duff-olympics-spt-intl", "text": "It\u2019s a race that requires a mesmerizing mix of strength and endurance; one that pushes the fittest of the fit to the edge of what they think is possible. And now, after a steady start, the fitness phenomenon that is HYROX has finally found its stride. HYROX is a functional fitness race which involves an eight-kilometer (almost five-mile) run interspersed with eight workout stations. Each station requires participants to perform a different exercise \u2013 SkiErg, sled push, sled pull, burpee broad jumps, rowing, farmer\u2019s carry, sandbag lunges and the dreaded wall balls. Competitors are able to compete in teams, pairs or by themselves. No matter the age or ability, the race format remains the same \u2013 the only difference being the differing weights used at the stations. HYROX\u2019s first iteration in 2017 saw 618 participants, while now it boasts more than 210,000 across 30 cities. CNN recently spoke to two women at the forefront of HYROX\u2019S charge to discover what life is like at the top of the latest fitness craze. Meg Jacoby Meg Jacoby is the newly crowned world champion, demolishing the elite women\u2019s field at the World Championships in Nice, France, in June. The American was the first ever woman to complete a HYROX race in under one hour and only recently saw her solo world record beaten by compatriot Lauren Weeks. After she crossed the finish line, cementing her first world title, Jacoby fell to the floor in an equal measure of exhaustion and jubilation, where she was greeted by her nine-year-old daughter. \u201cMy daughter has sacrificed just as much, if not more, than I have because she\u2019s sacrificing a lot of time away from me so I can do what I need to do and be living my dream as an athlete,\u201d Jacoby tells CNN Sport. \u201cIt felt like it was all worth it. Having her there was just really, really special. She gets to witness so many strong, powerful, incredible women when she gets to watch my races \u2013 not just me.\u201d Jacoby only heard about HYROX in 2022. She signed up for the New York race later that year and started working with HYROX coach Rich Ryan. Despite admitting to some errors during her first race, Jacoby delivered an impressive time in New York. Four weeks later, in only her second race, the American broke the then women\u2019s pro world record in Chicago. \u201cAt that point, I knew I should probably go all in. It was pretty crazy to have that kind of success so quickly, but it seemed like just the right sport for me,\u201d Jacoby tells CNN. Despite somewhat stumbling upon HYROX, Jacoby had unknowingly been preparing for the sport for years. Her competitive streak was evident from an early age, with sports playing a major role in her upbringing \u2013 Jacoby\u2019s brother is also a professional bodybuilder. During college, she was an impressive middle-distance runner and has since competed in long-distance challenges. When a lot of the road races were suspended during the Covid lockdowns, Jacoby then turned her attention to powerlifting. Before discovering HYROX, when people asked Jacoby what she was training for in the gym, her answer was emphatic: \u201cI want to be hard to kill.\u201d Jacoby has now quit her day job to focus fully on being a professional athlete. She runs up to seven times a week and combines endurance sessions with hours in the gym. Jacoby says she trains for two or three sessions per day but is aware that might sound \u201cintimidating\u201d to other people. \u201cYou can have a lot of success in this without having to do that type of volume,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s just kind of where I\u2019m at and what I know works for me and what my body needs.\u201d Jacoby knows the importance of diet and recovery. She aims to sleep at least eight hours every night and fuels her body with a high-carb, high-protein diet. \u201cMy diet is very boring,\u201d she laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of chicken and rice. It\u2019s kind of mundane, but that\u2019s kind of the life of an athlete. It\u2019s repetitive.\u201d Despite being in gladiator-like shape, even Jacoby struggles to describe what a HYROX race feels like. \u201cI think all of us at this level are a little bit crazy,\u201d she says, explaining why she has picked such a grueling sport. \u201cWe have a lot of enjoyment for pain and suffering.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m always discovering more and more about myself as a person, pushing myself to my limits and kind of seeing what I\u2019m made of.\u201d Jacoby says the sense of community is another reason she dedicates her life to HYROX and says she finds inspiration from all corners of the sport \u2013 notably some of the other mothers who balance training with raising a family. She is also aware of another athlete, from London, who is excelling at the other end of the scale \u2013 with a badass moniker to match. The \u2018Badass Gran\u2019 Celia Duff, who is 70, was recently crowned world champion in the 70-74 category \u2013 an accolade to go alongside the 65-69 world title she won last year. She has also been a world record holder twice but is quick to point out that both her records have since been broken. \u201cI have an allotment, I have chickens, I have a dog. I help with the grandchildren, when help is needed, and pick them up from school and so on. I\u2019m very busy doing not a huge amount,\u201d Duff tells CNN Sport, drastically underplaying her quite astonishing achievements on an international stage. Like Jacoby, Duff found the sport of HYROX somewhat by mistake. Duff\u2019s daughter was an early adopter of the phenomenon and one day asked her mom to come along to an event in October 2022. Duff had always kept herself fit \u2013 she was a good rower during her youth and stepped up her fitness routine during the Covid lockdowns. But after agreeing to compete at her first HYROX event, Duff started reading up about the race and quickly realized she was in for a tough day. Incredibly, though, she went on to break the world record for her 65-69 category, in a time which qualified her for the 2023 World Championships in Manchester, England \u2013 a race she also went on to win. Duff says there is only a \u201ctiny\u201d number of people her age competing in HYROX \u2013 perhaps unsurprisingly given the physical toll it has on the body. But for Duff, a retired public health doctor, the sport gives her focus and the training helps her to stay young. The grandmother runs three times a week, mixing up the pace and distance of each session. She also works with a coach for her strength training and spends time practicing the exact movements she is required to do for the HYROX stations. Rest, though, is almost as important, and Duff takes at least a day off per week to allow her body to recover. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly important to keep mobile and strong as you get older because, if you don\u2019t, the rate at which you deteriorate increases,\u201d she says, explaining the \u201cwhy\u201d behind her participation. \u201cI want to be strong and functionally fit. That\u2019s the key to HYROX.\u201d Dubbed the \u201cBadass Gran,\u201d Duff isn\u2019t altogether comfortable with being called an \u201cinspiration\u201d to others, but a brief look through the comments posted on her Instagram demonstrates just how much she is motivating others to get fit. \u201cI\u2019m genuinely humble and grateful,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I can encourage older people or anybody, actually, just to get up and have a go, then great.\u201d Despite her short but impressive career as as HYROX athlete, Duff says it would be \u201cbonkers\u201d for her to continue racing because of the \u201cbody-breaking\u201d work involved. However, she does plan on competing with her daughter in a doubles event later this year and wants to continue being involved with the sport. Olympic aspirations Duff and Jacoby are proof that something is working for HYROX. The business was set up in 2017 by events organizer Christian Toetzke and three-time Olympic hockey medalist Moritz F\u00fcrste. F\u00fcrste says the concept took a while for people to understand and the business was badly hampered by Covid, which forced the cancelation of races around the world. Now, though, HYROX is seeing exponential growth and is racing to catch up with the increased demand. Some former athletes have also tested themselves against the challenge, including former NFL linebacker Curt Maggitt and ex-soccer star John Terry. \u201cIt took time to break through in a certain way, to really get into that wider range of people, seeing what it is and stepping out of that shadow,\u201d co-founder F\u00fcrste tells CNN. With its growing popularity, HYROX is now looking to further professionalize the sport, which has Olympic aspirations. Earlier this year, anti-doping measures were brought into the single and doubles rulebooks, meaning HYROX athletes are now held to the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). \u201cWe are not there yet, but if one day HYROX would be an Olympic sport, that would be the ultimate goal and achievement and just a very, very cool thing,\u201d F\u00fcrste adds. Before even entertaining Olympic status,\u00a0though, F\u00fcrste says a governing body and national federations would need to be created \u2013 things that take time to set up. But there is certainly appetite from the athletes, and Jacoby hopes to one day represent her country. \u201cYou won\u2019t be seeing me going away until then,\u201d says Jacoby when asked about the sport\u2019s progression towards Olympic status. \u201cTo be an Olympic athlete is the absolute highest level you could ever reach.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/sport/hyrox-meg-jacoby-celia-duff-olympics-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "sports"}}

The official attendance of 20,366 is the fifth-largest crowd in WNBA history and broke the Aces\u2019 franchise record by almost 3,000. The game was moved from the Michelob ULTRA Arena, the Aces\u2019 regular home, to the bigger T-Mobile Arena to accommodate the increased demand for tickets due to Clark\u2019s visit. Plum, who reached the 3,000 career points milestone, finished with a stat line of 34 points, six rebounds and five assists for the two-time defending champions, while two-time MVP A\u2019ja Wilson had 28 points, nine rebounds, two steals and five blocks.

She will go to the Paris Olympics as one of the stars of the US team and a strong favorite to defend her title from three years ago, with Dutch athlete Femke Bol likely to provide the strongest competition. Cockrell and Jasmine Jones completed the podium at the US Trials with personal-best times of 52.64 and 52.77 to qualify for the Paris Games. \u201cI would love to dip under 50 at some point,\u201d said McLaughlin-Levrone. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s this year or if that\u2019s next year.

{"id": "2024_07_03_sport_pat-spencer-nba-lacrosse-warriors-spt-intl", "text": "Every young athlete dreams of draft day, picturing themselves being selected and then imagining a long and prosperous professional career. This fantasy became a reality for Pat Spencer. The Loyola Greyhound was drafted first in the 2019 Premier Lacrosse League (PLL) draft, but the college record-breaker then decided to take his career in a completely different direction. Spencer returned to college to play an extra year of basketball, hoping to carve out a career in the NBA instead. It seems the gamble paid off when Spencer made his first NBA appearance with the Golden State Warriors in 2024. Running and gunning For as long as he can remember, Spencer had always been a multi-sport athlete. \u201cI think the peak was probably childhood, where I got to play everything,\u201d the NBA guard tells CNN Sport of his early sporting endeavors. \u201cI had great parents that basically took me to any practice that was in the state. \u201cI played on upwards of four or five teams at one time. So, between baseball, basketball, football and lacrosse, I was always running and gunning.\u201d Spencer eventually needed to narrow down his sporting options. \u201cI was really small as a freshman in high school, I was five-four, 120 pounds,\u201d Spencer, who is now listed at 6-foot-3 and 205 pounds, recalls. \u201cBut that same five-four kid still had that edge and competitive desire to play at the highest level at whatever it would be.\u201d Spencer opted to pursue the sport he thought he had the best chance of being a success in and knew his height would be less of an issue moving up the ranks in lacrosse. Loyola University and the Wildcats lacrosse team gave Spencer an opportunity to showcase his talents on the collegiate level. Four years of smashing records and incredible success followed for Spencer at Loyola. The Wildcat left college as the NCAA Division I all-time leader in assists and second in points but, despite the accolades, basketball continued to linger in the back of his mind. \u201cThe whole time I felt like I owed it to Loyola to kind of see it through and play those four years out. But I knew in the back of my mind that I was going to be playing ball and that this is what I was going to be doing long term,\u201d Spencer admits. \u201cI wanted to see it through with all my friends and all my teammates and the coaching staff and then \u2026 I knew I\u2019d be playing basketball.\u201d Growing pains Spencer used his year of graduate eligibility and opted to play basketball at Northwestern University in Illinois. \u201cI knew that whole year was going to be a growth year for me,\u201d Spencer says of his first year back on the court, detailing the various growing pains he experienced. \u201cI had a lot of bad habits and a lot of things that I needed to work on.\u201d The Northwestern Wildcats finished with a dismal 8-23 record, but Spencer says he is eternally grateful for the platform they provided him and the lessons he learned throughout that tough campaign. Equally, Spencer\u2019s belief in his ability and decision to play basketball never wavered. \u201cI don\u2019t have a plan B ever,\u201d he explains. \u201cI knew where I was capable of getting to. I was at the growing pains kind of year and had to get through it and figure out how to improve.\u201d After college, if basketball players want to fulfil their ambition, they would be usually picked in the NBA Draft or head to the G-League, the NBA\u2019s minor league. Spencer took a different path altogether. \u201cI had an opportunity over here fall through, and I felt like just one year of college ball and then having a blank year on the resume would be a no go,\u201d he explained. So Spencer opted to travel to Europe and played a handful of games for the Hamburg Towers of Germany\u2019s Basketball Bundesliga before returning to the US. The NBA After playing with the Capital City Go-Go, the Washington Wizards G-League affiliate, Spencer ended up signing with the Golden State Warriors and their G-League team the Santa Cruz Warriors. He played the 2023-24 season on a two-way contract which allowed him to switch between both teams as and when needed. From playing lacrosse, Spencer found himself in the locker room with the likes of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. \u201cI don\u2019t get starstruck or anything like that,\u201d said Spencer. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity, a challenge. Just watching those guys work, it sets the standard for myself and what I need to uphold in the offseason.\u201d While he hasn\u2019t had a \u2018welcome to the NBA moment\u2019 on the court, Spencer says that watching the work ethic of the stars on his team is a lesson in itself. The guard says observing Curry, the NBA\u2019s all-time leading three-point scorer, sprint around the court practicing three-pointers is a constant reminder of how impressive the level is. Not only is Spencer learning from future Hall of Famers on a team with championship-winning pedigree, he is also learning under veteran coach Steve Kerr and his son Nick. \u201cNick has been our coach and I feel like he\u2019s an extension of his dad,\u201d Spencer explains. \u201cBoth of them are, obviously, highly smart individuals in terms of basketball, but also super understanding and want to see the best for each individual.\u201d A two-way player has to be ready at any given moment and Spencer\u2019s first points in the NBA came in March against the Memphis Grizzlies when he showed off his athleticism with a dunk. The 27-year-old is hoping that those points will be the first of many. \u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed the whole journey, but, not even close to the finish yet,\u201d Spencer said ahead of what he describes as an important summer to get back to peak athleticism. \u201cIt\u2019s always been the same goal to get on an NBA roster, a full contract and have an opportunity to compete, and contribute in a high, high fashion and try to win a championship.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/sport/pat-spencer-nba-lacrosse-warriors-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "sports"}}

A spiraling diplomatic row erupted after Turkish defender Merih Demiral made an alleged ultra-nationalist gesture \u2013 also known as a \u2018wolf salute,\u2019 which is associated with the Turkish right-wing extremist group \u201cGrey Wolves\u201d \u2013 during his team\u2019s win over Austria on Tuesday. \u201cThe Turkish ambassador was summoned this morning,\u201d the ministry said in a statement to CNN, a day after Turkey recalled the German ambassador in Ankara. German representatives discussed the incident with the Turkish ambassador in Berlin, the ministry added. UEFA, the governing body of European soccer, announced in a statement on Wednesday that it is investigating Demiral\u2019s \u201calleged inappropriate behavior\u201d and sparked condemnation from German leaders, but Ankara immediately branded Berlin\u2019s reaction as \u201cxenophobia\u201d and summoned Germany\u2019s ambassador. \u201dWe can confirm the German ambassador to Turkey was summoned yesterday,\u201d Germany\u2019s foreign ministry said Thursday. Germany\u2019s Interior Minister Nancy Faeser warned Wednesday \u201cthe symbols of Turkish right-wing extremists have no place in our stadiums\u201d and said that \u201cusing the European football championships as a platform for racism is completely unacceptable.\u201d Faeser added that the \u201cGrey Wolves\u201d group is under surveillance in Germany. CNN\u2019s German affiliate network NTV reported Thursday that Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan is set to come to Berlin on Saturday for Turkey\u2019s game against the Netherlands. Following Turkey\u2019s 2-1 round of 16 victory against Austria, Demiral\u00a0posted a picture of himself\u00a0making the controversial gesture\u00a0on X, formerly known as Twitter. \u201cHappy is one who calls themselves a Turk,\u201d the defender captioned the post. \u201cI had a certain specific celebration in mind. That\u2019s what I did. It has to do with the Turkish identity because I\u2019m very proud to be a Turk.

Having pulled down 16 rebounds and needing two points to post double-figures in both stats yet again, Reese knocked down two free throws with 23 seconds left in the matchup to reach the milestone. She moved past the previous record of nine games, held by two-time WNBA MVP and former Sky player Candace Parker. Reese became the first rookie to have a double-double in seven straight-games in Chicago\u2019s win against the Dallas Wings on June 20. It was the first part of a day to remember for the 22-year-old as she was later named BET\u2019s Sportswoman of the Year.

The National Women\u2019s Soccer League\u2019s (NWSL) club described statements about it and its president as \u201cinaccurate and defamatory,\u201d and said it would pursue \u201call legal avenues available to appropriately address this matter.\u201d The statement, which is signed by Alvarado, also claimed club president Jill Ellis \u201cfostered an environment where abusive behaviors among her subordinates are allowed to flourish.\u201d Alvarado also called for the National Women\u2019s Soccer League NWSL to remove Ellis from San Diego and the league, saying the treatment under her has \u201cbeen nothing short of life-altering and devastating to our mental health.\u201d CNN cannot verify any of Alvarado\u2019s claims and has reached out to her for comment. Ellis said Wednesday that mental health is a \u201cpriority\u201d at the club and they \u201chave support measures\u201d for any employee that might need it. \u201cOur staff and I will always honor how someone feels,\u201d Ellis said in a statement to CNN via the club. \u201cOver time, we have actively responded to employees who have shown or expressed needs related to their mental health. I want to reinforce that Wave FC has a robust Employee Assistance Program that is promoted regularly to employees. \u201cI will continue to protect former and current employee confidentiality. When allegations of mistreatment have been made, we have taken them seriously and investigated them thoroughly. \u201cIn addition, when appropriate, independent third parties have assisted us in evaluating our workplace. At no time have those evaluations uncovered any wrongdoing by the club. \u201cWhat we do is all about fostering a culture of respect, inclusivity, and excellence. The false accusations in today\u2019s post are not only personally damaging but also take away from the incredible work and progress we\u2019ve achieved together as a team.

The 57-year-old was named the inaugural president of the Wave in 2021 ahead of its debut season. Alvarado, who was a video and creative manager for the club, said she resigned from the club on June 7 and that she received an email 10 days later from an unnamed senior leadership member calling her \u201cthe most pathetic person I\u2019ve ever met\u201d and that they were \u201cestatic that you are no longer with the club.\u201d The Wave called the email \u201cfabricated\u201d and denounced the allegations against Ellis as \u201ccategorically false.\u201d Alvarado also criticized the league, saying it \u201cconsistently failed to take meaningful action\u201d and \u201cturned a blind eye to a pattern of profoundly damaging behaviors\u201d\u00a0within the Wave.  An NWSL spokesperson said in a statement to CNN that the \u201csafety, health, and well-being of everyone associated with our league is our highest priority. \u201cWe take serious any and every report of potential misconduct, hire qualified independent investigators to review those allegations thoroughly, and act when allegations are supported by the facts uncovered. \u201cWe have mandated corrective action in every instance where reports have been corroborated, up to and including the removal of individuals who do not live up to our values and standards.\u201d The league added that they \u201cencourage anyone with information of potential wrongdoing to report that misconduct to the League Safety Officer. Alternatively, individuals may report anonymously via Real Response, by texting 872-259-6975.\u201d Current Wave striker and two-time Women\u2019s World Cup winner Alex Morgan said she was \u201cdisappointed to hear about the allegations.\u201d \u201cAs players, we have worked hard to build a team that is surrounded by an inclusive, positive and safe environment,\u201d the 35-year-old wrote on X. \u201cBut it\u2019s important to me that we are creating that environment for both players AND staff throughout the entire organization.

When approached for comment on the Enhanced Games and allegations of corruption, the IOC told CNN Sport that \u201cthe idea does not merit any comment.\u201d \u2018Danger to health, to sport\u2019 CNN Sport interviewed a number of experts in the field of doping for this story, who expressed concern that the Enhanced Games was an extremely dangerous proposition. Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, who exposed Russia\u2019s state-sponsored doping program \u2013 a massive, years-long effort which benefited more than 1,000 athletes between 2011 and 2015 \u2013 said that the Enhanced Games is a \u201cdanger to health, to sport.\u201d Whether the Enhanced Games will ever take place remains an open question, but the very idea is drawing considerable blowback from leading anti-doping officials and sporting organizations. The Enhanced Games is the brainchild of businessman Aron D\u2019Souza. He is also the founding editor of \u201cThe Journal Jurisprudence,\u201d a quarterly publication on legal philosophy, according to his website, which also describes him as an \u201cavid athlete.\u201d Recently, D\u2019Souza told CNN Sport he has \u201csigned term sheets with prominent venture capital firms\u201d in relation to the Enhanced Games and is \u201cwaiting on the lawyers to finish long-form drafting.\u201d He also said that a funding announcement is planned for early December. Although not legally binding, term sheets are a serious expression of intent by both sides, setting out the broad principles of an agreement. D\u2019Souza believes what he calls a \u201cscience-driven\u201d competition is the next step in the evolution of sport, suggesting that the absence of drug testing will level the playing field. According to a 2020 study from Raphael Faiss, Research Manager at the centre of Research and Expertise in anti-doping sciences at the University of Lausanne, data from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) suggests less than 2% of athletes dope. However, Faiss told CNN Sport the number of athletes taking performance-enhancing drugs is likely significantly higher; his research, based on two international major athletic events in 2011 and 2013, suggests the figure could be between 15 to 18%. Faiss and his team compared athletes\u2019 blood results collected by WADA-accredited labs to values from healthy adults, as well as doped and undoped athletes; the closer the values are to those of subjects to whom erythropoietin (EPO, which is used in blood doping) had been administered, the higher the chances that they\u2019re actually doping. This analysis, Faiss said, is not proof of doping, but is a \u201crobust way\u201d of analyzing the data, allowing scientists to make an estimate for doping prevalence, as well as targeting athletes most likely to be doping. In written comments to CNN Sport, WADA said: \u201cDetermining the level of [doping] prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed,\u201d explaining that, since 2017, a \u201cprevalence working group\u201d has been established to \u201cdetermine if strategies, reliable methods and tools can be developed to adequately assess the prevalence of doping in sports.\u201d WADA told CNN Sport that the group has delivered \u201cseveral recommendations and guidance to WADA but not the final ones yet.\u201d WADA has reservations about Faiss\u2019 study and pointed to the \u201ccomplexity of trying to measure [doping] prevalence,\u201d highlighting that reports have \u201cgreatly varying results.\u201d The anti-doping organization added: \u201cNo single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline.\u201d \u201cComparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system\u2019s testing figures isn\u2019t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence. \u201cIn any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries \u2013 it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others. \u201cThe Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures.\u201d Editor\u2019s note: You can find WADA\u2019s full statement at the bottom of this article.\u00a0 \u2018A dangerous clown show\u2019 Travis Tygart, the Chief Executive Officer at the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), told CNN Sport that the idea of an Enhanced Games is \u201cfarcical \u2026 likely illegal in many [US] states\u201d and \u201ca dangerous clown show, not real sport.\u201d Substances such as anabolic steroids \u2013 which help to build muscle mass by enabling athletes to train harder and recover quickly from strenuous workouts \u2013 are classified as a Schedule III drug by the US Drug Enforcement Administration. When asked whether anabolic steroids will be allowed at the games and whether athletes would be tested for illegal drugs such as cocaine, D\u2019Souza told CNN Sport that \u201cwe will not be drug testing at the games.\u201d He added: \u201cWe do not propose to regulate what athletes use.\u201d Anabolic steroids may be prescribed by a licensed physician for the treatment of certain conditions such as testosterone deficiency, but if used in the US without a prescription from a licensed physician, a first conviction could result in a one-year prison sentence and a $1,000 fine. But that isn\u2019t the only potential legal jeopardy the Enhanced Games faces, according to American lawyer Jim Walden, who represents Russian whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov. \u201cIf you look at the Enhanced Games website, it\u2019s almost as though they\u2019re advertising their disregard of the law,\u201d Walden told CNN Sport. \u201cThey wrap themselves up in what I will call the cloak of legitimacy by using phrases like body autonomy and coming out as an enhanced athlete. \u201cI hope they\u2019re thinking hard about how they\u2019re going to pull this off in the world in which the FBI has a specific unit that is called the Sports and Gaming Initiative that\u2019s focusing on these very issues.\u201d The Sports and Gaming Initiative was developed to \u201cprotect athletes and sporting institutions in the United States from criminal threats and influences,\u201d according to the government website. The initiative works in partnership with sports leagues and governing bodies, international law enforcement and independent watchdog groups to tackle crimes such as fraud, doping and match-fixing; criminal activities, it says, \u201cdegrade the integrity of sports and competition and erode public confidence in these cherished institutions.\u201d \u201cThe use of doping substances is not acceptable in modern sports,\u201d Rodchenkov said in his written comments to CNN. \u201cPromotion and advertising of banned substances is against sport rules and moral, letter and spirit. \u201cIt might bring an extreme harm to young generation[s] of athletes who mistakenly could believe in benefits of [the] Enhanced Games.\u201d Rodchenkov, the protagonist of the Oscar-winning Netflix documentary Icarus who is currently under FBI protection, also believes that the Enhanced Games\u2019 organizers \u201cmight get investigated [\u2026] under the Rodchenkov Act.\u201d The Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act, named after the whistleblower, allows the US to impose criminal sanctions on individuals involved in doping activities at international events. However, the Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act does not apply to sporting events that don\u2019t adopt the WADA code, which the Enhanced Games wouldn\u2019t do. Rodchenkov also added that WADA athletes could not have any affiliation or contact with so-called enhanced athletes, or they would risk being charged under Article 2.10 \u2013 \u201cProhibited Association by an Athlete or Other Person\u201d \u2013 of the World Anti-Doping Code. USADA\u2019s Tygart also told CNN Sport: \u201cNo one really wants our children growing up idolizing unbridled drug use in sport, even if some profiteers think otherwise.\u201d D\u2019Souza insists his motivation for founding the Enhanced Games isn\u2019t financial. If he had wanted to make more money, he says he\u2019d continue to be a \u201cquiet, mild-mannered venture capitalist.\u201d \u201cI do think fundamentally that consumers want this [the Enhanced Games] and athletes want this because if you go to the cinemas, no one\u2019s interested in histories in the past anymore,\u201d said D\u2019Souza. \u201cThey\u2019re interested in superheroes and technology in the future. And this is literally what we are bringing to a reality.\u201d \u2018The dirtiest Olympics in history\u2019 According to Pierre de Coubertin \u2013 the founder of the modern Olympics \u2013 \u201cfor every man, woman and child, it [sport] offers an opportunity for self-improvement.\u201d Except historically, many athletes competing in the Olympics have taken the idea of self-improvement too far, notably at London 2012, which Rodchenkov has previously called \u201cthe dirtiest Olympics in history.\u201d When the ITA concluded its re-analysis program for the London Games, it found 73 anti-doping rule violations, which led to the withdrawal of 31 medals and reallocation of 46 Olympic medals across the sports of athletics, weightlifting, wrestling and canoeing. Doping has been an issue at the Olympics throughout the event\u2019s history, and the 100-meter final at the 1988 Games has become one of the most infamous and controversial moments in sporting history. Six of the eight finalists \u2013 notably the winner, Ben Johnson \u2013 who lined up on that September day in Seoul 35 years ago would fail drug tests themselves or be implicated in drug use during their careers. Despite some athletes continuing to cheat, global antidoping efforts remain ever-present, according to the testers. Recent out-of-competition (OOC) testing data published by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) highlights positive results from steps being taken to keep \u201celite podiums and finals clean,\u201d according to the anti-doping organization. Data focused on OOC testing ahead of last year\u2019s World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon, shows how resources and testing are targeting those athletes most likely to win medals and make finals. Whilst only 39% of the athletes in Eugene had three or more OOC tests in the 10 months leading up the event, 81% of top-eight finishers had three or more OOC tests. Yet the cat and mouse game between testers and athletes using banned substances continues. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly about the question of timing and targeting the right athletes,\u201d said Faiss. Given that athletes have their blood values regularly monitored, it is \u201cgetting more difficult for athletes to use high doses [of drugs such as EPO], but they would still be using micro dosing.\u201d By taking EPO late at night and drinking enough water, the substance would not be detected in athletes the following morning, according to Faiss, though athletes suspected of blood doping could be tested in the middle of the night. \u201cAthletes are actually getting back to very simple ways of doping with steroids,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cEPO is quite simple to use, but still tricky to detect.\u201d Athletes \u201cuse the drugs that are actively working.\u201d When it comes to new substances such as Roxadustat \u2013 the drug that two-time grand slam champion Simona Halep has recently been given a four-year ban for taking, although she denies ever knowingly or intentionally taking any prohibited substance \u2013 Faiss said athletes \u201care likely to use substances with a very short half-life in [the] body that are mimicking processes of the oxygen carrying improvements through the EPO channels.\u201d Roxadustat has an elimination half-life of 10-16 hours, according to the National Institutes of Health. Athletes are \u201cseeking to find substances where the [half-life] time window is very short, to make sure that if they are not tested at the right moment, they won\u2019t be caught,\u201d said Faiss. \u2018Challenge for sporting competition\u2019 Michele Verroken, the founding director of consultancy group Sporting Integrity, believes an antidoping system is required that will \u201cgive a lot more credibility, a lot more immediacy to verifying results, if we\u2019re going to keep the hearts and minds of athletes.\u201d Verroken also questions what\u2019s stopping an athlete from cheating if they only get caught 10 years after the event, or not at all. Under the World Anti-Doping Code, there is a 10-year statute of limitations on samples taken from 2015 onwards. Verroken told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games is \u201csetting a really interesting challenge for sporting competition.\u201d Not unsurprisingly, many sporting bodies have condemned the event. The Australian Olympic Committee called it \u201cdangerous and irresponsible,\u201d saying that \u201cthe world needs better than this.\u201d UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) said it \u201cis extremely concerned by the concept of an Enhanced Games,\u201d adding that \u201cthere is no place in sport for performance enhancing drugs, nor the Enhanced Games.\u201d UKAD\u2019s Director of Operations, Hamish Coffey, told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games sets a \u201chugely dangerous precedent,\u201d expressing concern over the kind of messaging the event sends to the next generation of athletes. \u2018Very accomplished athletes\u2019 When CNN Sport spoke to D\u2019Souza shortly after the proposed event\u2019s announcement, he said that 368 athletes had enquired about the Enhanced Games and more had messaged via social media. The organization\u2019s Chief Athletes Officer and former Olympian Brett Fraser, who swam for the Cayman Islands at three Olympic Games, told CNN Sport that \u201cvery accomplished athletes\u201d at the level of Olympic finalists have reached out \u201cto understand more about how the first Games will take place and how they can become involved.\u201d Fraser added that Enhanced Games organizers \u201calready have an Olympic medallist\u201d for their athlete commission, though he didn\u2019t specify who that was. He also said there has been \u201ca lot of positive feedback and a lot of acceptance and excitement from younger generations.\u201d Nonetheless, none of the athletes appear prepared to speak publicly at this stage. For those who do want to compete, the Enhanced Games would be an annual event with five categories \u2013 track and field, swimming, weightlifting, gymnastics and martial arts. The huge cost of hosting an Olympic Games is no secret, with countries often striving to create bigger and better spectacles by blowing their budget. Tokyo 2021 had the largest Olympic sports program in history, with 33 sports competitions in 42 venues culminating in 339 medal events. The Covid-impacted Games were delivered with a final expenditure of $13 billion \u2013 almost double the $7.3 billion that was originally forecast. Meanwhile, keeping the IOC\u2019s philosophy of \u201clower-impact Games\u201d in mind, 95% of venues will be pre-existing facilities at the Paris 2024 Olympics. D\u2019Souza said the Enhanced Games will focus on fewer sports, reuse existing infrastructure and fund the event through the private sector to \u201cdeliver a high-impact yet cost-efficient games\u201d so profits can be shared with the athletes. He added that the Enhanced Games is looking for a seven-figure prize pool for any athlete potentially breaking Usain Bolt\u2019s 100-meter world record of 9.58 seconds. \u201cI\u2019ve had conversations with people who are top-10 sprinters in the world who are going to the next Olympics, and they said [\u2026] if there\u2019s a million-dollar prize to break the 100m world record, I\u2019ll be there,\u201d said D\u2019Souza. Universal basic income and mental health support to athletes will also be part of an \u201cenhanced athletes programme.\u201d When asked who would take responsibility if an athlete competing at the Enhanced Games were to suffer fatal consequences, D\u2019Souza told CNN Sport that \u201cour athletes at the games will be the most monitored athletes in history.\u201d He said: \u201cWe will focus on athlete safety by mandating athletes have pre-competition full-system clinical screenings including blood tests and EKGs.\u201d \u201cThis will ensure that athletes are healthy to complete and not at risk of major health complications.\u201d D\u2019Souza also said that athletes will sign waivers in order\u00a0to compete. As it stands, no venues are officially in place to host the event and D\u2019Souza admits its scale will be dependent on funding and media partnerships. \u201cWe\u2019re in commercial negotiations with venues and media partners at the moment,\u201d added D\u2019Souza, who said the first Enhanced Games will be at a university campus or a similar facility in the south of the US and that a number of trademarks have been filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. \u2018Undermine the very purpose of sport\u2019 Elite performance coach Trevor Painter, who has worked with a number of Olympic and international sprinters and middle-distance runners, said he would \u201cnever\u201d coach an athlete taking performance-enhancing drugs because it would go against his morals as a coach. \u201cHaving been involved with many athletes that have lost in many ways to the cheats, I won\u2019t be engaging with [the Enhanced Games],\u201d Painter told CNN Sport. If it goes ahead as planned in December 2024, D\u2019Souza insists that the Enhanced Games will unlock the potential of humanity. But according to John William Devine, Senior Lecturer in Ethics, Sport and Exercise Sciences at Swansea University in Wales, the Enhanced Games will make sporting competition more unfair than it already is and even \u201cundermine the very purpose of the sport in question.\u201d Devine told CNN Sport that \u201cperformance-enhancing drugs don\u2019t actually lead to better athletic performance. They obscure athletic performance.\u201d He added that, although the Enhanced Games may look very similar to the Olympics, the nature of the activity will be different, raising the question: \u201cTo what extent is drug-assisted performance reflective of the athletes\u2019 sporting excellence?\u201d WADA response in full: Determining the level of prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed. That is why we set up a\u00a0Working Group on Doping Prevalence\u00a0in 2017. Measuring doping prevalence is a difficult and complex process. Through its work, the group found a huge variance across the many prevalence studies that have been carried out, leading it to publish guidelines on how to improve the quality of measuring prevalence. WADA is currently developing a tool that Anti-Doping Organizations can use to evaluate the effectiveness of their programs. WADA is well aware of the [Faiss] study. Indeed, one of the contributors, Prof. Martial Saugy, is a member of the Working Group. This study is one of many that helps to inform the Group\u2019s work. It is a very narrow study. It looks at two events, in a single sport, held 10 and 12 years ago, using just one method of measurement (the Athlete Biological Passport (ABP)). As far as I am aware, there is no comparable data from more recent World Championships in the same sport. Given its limited scope, it is important that this study be analyzed within the wider context of other studies and not be taken in isolation. This study also highlights the complexity of trying to measure prevalence. It is the third published paper that sought to measure prevalence at the 2011 Athletics World Championships. Each reported greatly varying results. The fact is no single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline. Results will always come with caveats and margins of error and will be based on a variety of methods, including self-report questionnaires, analytical methods (like ABP and testing data) and other methods to give a more rounded estimate of what the most likely figure would be. Comparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system\u2019s testing figures isn\u2019t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence. In any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries \u2013 it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others. The Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/10/30/sport/enhanced-games-olympics-doping-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_sport_us-head-coach-gregg-berhalter-copa-america-spt-intl", "text": "US men\u2019s head coach Gregg Berhalter remained defiant despite his side crashing out of the Copa Am\u00e9rica on Monday. The US lost 1-0 to Uruguay in its final group game \u2013 meaning it finished third in Group C, out of the two qualifying places for the knockout stages. The poor performance piled yet more pressure on Berhalter, with critics questioning whether he\u2019s still the right person to lead the team heading into the 2026 World Cup, which is being co-hosted by the US. Shortly after the defeat, United States Soccer Federation\u2019s sporting director Matt Crocker said the team\u2019s performances \u201cfell short of our expectations\u201d and insisted that \u201cwe must do better.\u201d \u201cWe will be conducting a comprehensive review of our performance in Copa Am\u00e9rica and how best to improve the team and results as we look towards the 2026 World Cup,\u201d Crocker said in a statement. When asked by reporters after the game whether he was still the right person for the job, Berhalter replied: \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not happy with the results of the tournament, that\u2019s for sure. First and foremost, the expectations that we have are to do better than we did,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cWe are bitterly disappointed with it. The other stuff, that is out of my control, it\u2019s not something to spend a lot of time with.\u201d There had already been questions around the US men\u2019s team heading into this year\u2019s Copa Am\u00e9rica \u2013 which is being hosted in the United States. Despite boasting an array of young talent in the squad, there were concerns around whether the team could be competitive at the highest levels of the game. The tournament got off to a good start with a comfortable victory against Bolivia, but soon turned sour after a shock defeat to Panama. The result piled pressure on the final group game against an impressive Uruguay side and the US was found wanting in a lacklustre performance. \u201cJust to see the guys\u2019 faces in the locker room and to see the emotion of the staff and players, we\u2019re bitterly disappointed with the results,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cWe know that we\u2019re capable of more, and in this tournament, we didn\u2019t show it. It\u2019s really as simple as that. \u201cYou look at the stage that was set with the fans in this tournament, with the high level of competition in this tournament, and we should have done better. We\u2019ll do a review and figure out what went wrong and why it went wrong, but it\u2019s an empty feeling right now, for sure.\u201d Controversial goal Uruguay looked the better side throughout the match and found the decisive goal in the 66th minute through Math\u00edas Olivera. The defender reacted first to Matt Turner\u2019s save from Ronald Ara\u00fajo\u2019s header, bundling the ball over the line on the rebound. The goal was allowed to stand after a lengthy check from the video assistant referee (VAR), despite Olivera initially appearing to be in an offside position. The narrow call was questioned by US players and staff on the field and Berhalter addressed the controversy in his post-match press conference. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty crazy. I don\u2019t understand it,\u201d he said. Berhalter returned as head coach of the men\u2019s team in 2023 and was handed a contract which runs through the conclusion of the 2026 World Cup. The 50-year-old was previously named head coach of the team in 2018 and led the squad to the knockout stage of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar last year, but his contract expired at the conclusion of the tournament.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/sport/us-head-coach-gregg-berhalter-copa-america-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_sport_portugal-slovenia-ronaldo-last-16-euro-2024-spt-intl", "text": "Portugal advanced to the quarterfinals of Euro 2024 after beating Slovenia in a penalty shootout on Monday in a game where Cristiano Ronaldo was reduced to tears after missing a spot-kick in extra-time. Ronaldo had his penalty superbly saved by Jan Oblak after a frustrating evening for the striker. His failure to convert his penalty left the 39-year-old in tears and his teammates had to rally round the striker before the second period of extra-time. In the shootout, Ronaldo stepped up and made amends by scoring his team\u2019s first penalty while Portugal goalkeeper Diogo Costa saved all three of Slovenia\u2019s attempts. Costa is the first keeper to save three penalties at a European Championships. Portugal scored all four of their penalties with Bernardo Silva slotting home the fourth to confirm the victory. Costa had kept Portugal in the game during extra-time when he expertly saved from Slovenia\u2019s superstar youngster Benjamin \u0160e\u0161ko after the 21-year-old had pounced on a rare mistake from 41-year-old Pepe to run clear. Costa stuck out a leg to stop \u0160e\u0161ko from scoring and the game went to that penalty shootout. Portugal will now play France on July 5. A frustrating evening ends well Before Costa\u2019s goalkeeping masterclass, it had looked like it was going to be a frustrating evening for Portugal and Ronaldo personally. Having entered Monday\u2019s game without a goal at Euro 2024, it was more of the same at the Frankfurt Arena for Ronaldo. He had opportunities to score with his head, while as ever he also was on freekick duty for Portugal. He hit some of his efforts over the bar and another straight at Oblak. Ronaldo\u2019s best opportunity during normal time came in the final few minutes when he was played in on goal but his left-footed shot was straight at Oblak. As the game dragged on, Ronaldo cut an increasingly disheartened character. That was until the end of the first period of extra-time when his teammate Diogo Jota was felled in the Slovenia box and a penalty was awarded. Ronaldo, as the team\u2019s designated penalty taker, stepped up but Oblak was able to get a big hand to it, tipping it onto the post and away to safety. The frustrations of the moment clearly impacted Ronaldo and he was seen in tears during the extra-time interval as his teammates attempted to console him and get him in the right frame of mind for the rest of the match. Costa\u2019s huge save to deny \u0160e\u0161ko was the only major moment of the final 15 minutes of action before the penalty shootout, which was the first of the tournament. He saved all three Slovenian penalties while Ronaldo banished his demons by powering home his own attempt; after scoring, he raised a seemingly apologetic hand to the Portugal supporters behind the goal. Ronaldo has already made history at Euro 2024 by becoming the first player to feature in six European Championships, but he has lacked his usual cutting edge in this edition of the tournament. The veteran striker, who plays for Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr, has now gone seven games at major international tournaments with Portugal without scoring. Given he\u2019s scored a world record 130 goals, his recent inability to find the net is something of a surprise, but also raises question as to whether he should be a seemingly permanent fixture in the team. The 39-year-old made his European Championship debut back in 2004, when host Portugal was beaten by Greece in the final. Ronaldo went on to lead his nation to victory at Euro 2016, his only major trophy at international level, though he had to be substituted in the first half of the final after picking up an injury. The former Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus star featured in all of Portugal\u2019s Group F matches this year, without finding the net. The frustration of his inability to score on Monday appeared to be getting to Ronaldo and he could often be seen shouting to the heavens on several occasions when a chance went begging. Monday\u2019s game was a familiar story for Ronaldo to the rest of his Euro 2024, as he has yet to find the back of the net so far at the tournament. According to Goal, it was the first time he had finished a group stage without a goal. He has had also the most shots of any player in his four games at Euro 2024 \u2013 20 \u2013 with no goals to his name. Nonetheless, Friday\u2019s quarterfinal against France offers Ronaldo the chance to become the oldest goalscorer at the Euros should he find the net. Meanwhile Ronaldo\u2019s teammate Pepe, who is 41 years and 126 days old, made history on Monday by becoming the oldest player to appear in a knockout stage match in major tournaments surpassing the previous record set by former England goalkeeper Peter Shilton, per Opta.

According to the WTA, Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 is only the second defending\u00a0women\u2019s\u00a0champion to be ousted in Wimbledon\u2019s first round\u00a0in the last 30 years. Steffi Graf was the other champion to fall at the first hurdle in the defense of her title, when she was defeated by Lori McNeil\u00a0in 1994. Bouzas Maneiro picked up what was comfortably the biggest win of her career. This was just the third grand slam main draw of her career, while she\u2019d previously only logged one match against a top 10 player \u2013 a loss to Jelena Ostapenko in Madrid earlier this year. The 21-year-old Spaniard was ruthless throughout the match, converting all five of her break point opportunities. She clinched victory with a spectacular backhand winner down the line that left her opponent rooted to the spot. Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 recently had suffered a right hip injury ahead of the tournament, when the Czech slipped and fell on the grass at a tune-up event in Berlin. She was forced to retire from that Berlin second-round match, which occurred less than two weeks before Wimbledon. But it\u2019s a disappointing loss for Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1, who loses almost 2,000 ranking points as a result and will drop from her No. 6 ranking. The 25-year-old Czech player has had a handful of poor results in 2024 and has not reached a final since she famously defeated Ons Jabeur last year to become Wimbledon\u2019s first unseeded women\u2019s champion. Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 appeared to be turning things around at the French Open  \u2013 where she reached the quarterfinals before being defeated by the all-conquering Iga \u015awi\u0105tek \u2013 but was unable to carry that form into the grass court season.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/sport/marketa-vondrousova-jessica-bouzas-maneiro-wimbledon-upset-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "sports"}}

However, Murray does hope to play in the doubles with his brother Jamie, which will be his final appearance at Wimbledon. \u201cUnfortunately, despite working incredibly hard on his recovery since his operation just over a week ago, Andy has taken the very difficult decision not to play the singles this year,\u201d said a statement from the 37-year-old\u2019s team. \u201cAs you can imagine, he is extremely disappointed but has confirmed that he will be playing in the doubles with Jamie and looks forward to competing at Wimbledon for the last time.\u201d Murray had been scheduled to face Czech Republic\u2019s Tomas Machac in the first round of the grass-court grand slam on Tuesday and was waiting until the last moment to decide whether he would play. He has been recovering from surgery for a spinal cyst having pulled out of the Queen\u2019s Club Championship because of the back injury. Murray, a three-time grand slam champion, is approaching the end of his tennis career and previously said that the upcoming Olympics in Paris could be his final tournament. He said that he wants to \u201cgo out playing a proper match\u201d and wouldn\u2019t rule out participating at other tournaments this season if he was unable to be competitive at Wimbledon and the Olympics.

The 32-year-old joined the franchise in 2022 as an assistant coach of the American Hockey League\u2019s (AHL) Coachella Valley Firebirds, Seattle\u2019s minor league affiliate. She was the first woman to be appointed to a full-time assistant coaching role in the AHL and now gets the same opportunity in the NHL. Campbell said that she was \u201chumbled\u201d to be in the role. \u201cYou speak to the word first, to be the first,\u201d she said, per the NHL. \u201cBut that\u2019s never really where my focus is, it\u2019s always on the work, it\u2019s on the impact, it\u2019s on the job. There\u2019s a lot to this game and to this job, and so, I\u2019ve never taken it for granted. \u201cThough I am honored to be the first, I don\u2019t want to be the only, and I honestly don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m the only in this organization.

She has the ability to relate to players about their games and what they bring to a team.\u201d Campbell is a former forward who played college hockey with the Cornell Big Red and played professionally in Canada and Sweden. She worked under Bylsma as coach of the Firebirds after retiring and helped guide the team to back-to-back appearances in the Calder Cup, the AHL\u2019s championship series. The Canadian history maker is part of wider changes behind the Seattle benches. Bylsma was hired as head coach in May, replacing Dave Hakstol, after the Kraken ended last season with a 34-35-13 record and missed the Stanley Cup Playoffs. Campbell was announced alongside 11-year assistant coaching veteran Bob Woods, who was also hired to the same position. The Kraken are the NHL\u2019s newest team, founded as an expansion franchise and joining the league for the 2021-22 season.

Some might head out to the driving range, others may listen to music or discuss strategy with their caddie. Faced with an unprecedented level of stress, Nick Bienz took a more commonplace approach to stress relief: he headed to the bar. Three beers and eight nerve-wracking holes later, the 27-year-old stamped his ticket to his first ever PGA Tour event. The Golf Galaxy employee will not be available to work this week, after he secured his place in the field at Thursday\u2019s Rocket Mortgage Classic with a terrific \u2013 and slightly tipsy \u2013 qualifying performance on Monday. Hoagland, Indiana, native Bienz had faced an anxious wait to discover his fate after five birdies and an eagle had sent him back to the clubhouse atop the leaderboard with a bogey-free seven-under 65. With multiple groups still finishing their rounds at The Orchards Golf Club in Washington, Michigan, the Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) alumni headed to the bar to summon some Dutch courage. While nursing his second beer, he was joined at the table by Ryan French \u2013 or, as he is better known on social media, Monday Q Info \u2013 who has amassed 170,000 followers in his coverage of those hopefuls grinding away on golf\u2019s developmental tours and qualifying events. \u201cI need every ounce of alcohol right now to calm the nervous system and not try to vomit on myself,\u201d Bienz told French in a video shared on X, formerly known as Twitter. \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019re at right now.\u201d It was uncharted territory for Bienz, who explained to French that he works at Golf Galaxy \u2013 a golf equipment and apparel retailer with stores across the US \u2013 to help fund his professional career, arriving early or staying late to take advantage of the shop\u2019s in-house practice facilities. The biggest event he had played to date was a state open, according to French. He had attempted to qualify for events before, including several on the Korn Ferry Tour \u2013 the PGA Tour\u2019s developmental circuit \u2013 but had never been so close to getting over the line. Having previously packed a week\u2019s worth of clothes in anticipation of making it through, Bienz \u2013 chasing any way to change his luck \u2013 had only brought enough for Monday. \u201cI think I play better when I don\u2019t have any expectations, to the point where I didn\u2019t even bring any clothes beyond today,\u201d Bienz told the PGA Tour. \u201cI had to go buy underwear and socks last night because I ran out of those.\u201d \u2018I have to call my boss\u2019 Bienz and four others headed into the playoff in a straight shootout for the final two spots. A nail-biting war of attrition ensued, with Bienz driving brilliantly to keep himself among the three players that headed to the eighth playoff hole. Having almost holed out with his approach, Bienz tapped in from a few feet away to clinch his place in a field that will fight for its share of a $9.2 million prize purse \u2013 not that he can recall the moment itself. \u201cI don\u2019t remember hitting the putt,\u201d Bienz added to the PGA Tour. \u201cI know that sounds really crazy, but I don\u2019t remember hitting the putt on 18 in regulation either to make birdie. Once it hit, I was like, \u2018This is surreal.\u2019\u201d Once he has figured out what he is going to wear at Detroit Golf Club on Thursday, Bienz will turn his focus to taking on some of the PGA Tour\u2019s biggest names, including South Korea\u2019s rising star Tom Kim, who was narrowly beaten by rampant world No.1 Scottie Scheffler in a playoff at last week\u2019s Travelers Championship. \u201cNo matter what happens \u2013 if I shoot 80-80 the first round and I miss the cut \u2013 at least I can hold my head up high and say, \u2018You finally did it, you finally got into one,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid to say it\u2019s all gravy because, obviously, if you want to play professionally, you can\u2019t just get to the PGA Tour, you have to play well on the PGA Tour.\u201d Then there is the prospect of viral fame to wrestle with, with French\u2019s coverage of Bienz\u2019s heroics capturing the imagination of fans and players alike. \u201cPair him with me,\u201d four-time PGA Tour champion Kevin Kisner \u2013 also in action Thursday \u2013 demanded of the PGA Tour in a post on X, while a Venmo link for Bienz shared by French has drawn in a flurry of payments, including $500 from Ohio-based Garage Beer. \u201cI Facetimed my fianc\u00e9e in the cart on the way back and she was sobbing, couldn\u2019t get words out \u2026 The first thing she said to me she was like, \u2018You\u2019re famous,\u201d Bienz added to the PGA Tour. \u201c\u2019I was like, \u2018What does that even mean, it\u2019s a Monday qualifier?\u2019 She couldn\u2019t get many words out, but she was like, \u2018I\u2019m proud of you.\u2019\u201d Before he left the course, Bienz reconvened with French for a final debrief. \u201cI have to call my boss and call off work tomorrow for sure,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be there 7:30 in the morning and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/sport/nick-bienz-pga-tour-beer-qualifier-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "sports"}}

{"id": "2024_05_23_sport_kathleen-noble-rowing-uganda-paris-olympics-spt-intl", "text": "From learning how to row in boats patched together with duct tape to competing at the world championships in a different sport entirely, Kathleen Noble\u2019s rise to the apex of rowing has certainly been unconventional. Her journey now sees the 29-year-old set to become a two-time Olympian \u2013 Noble represented Uganda at the Tokyo Games \u2013 when she competes at Paris 2024. She is Uganda\u2019s first Olympic rowing participant, as well as the African nation\u2019s first and only White Olympian across any sporting discipline. A prodigious swimmer in her youth, Noble represented Uganda at the 2012 World Swimming Championships at just 17 years of age. Then, on a whim during her time as a student at Princeton University, Noble was convinced to try her hand at rowing. \u201cWhen I took my first steps into the sport, I had no thoughts or intentions of competing at a high level and certainly couldn\u2019t have imagined that this would be the direction that things would go,\u201d Noble tells CNN Sport. \u201cTo be honest, it is still a bit surreal to be competing on a stage like this. I don\u2019t think it was until they actually told me that Uganda wanted to send me to the Olympic qualifiers that I really thought, \u2018Oh, okay, maybe there\u2019s something here.\u2019\u201d Equipment issues The sport of rowing is still very much in its nascent stages across many parts of Africa, including Uganda. It was properly introduced to the country back in 2009 when the World Rowing Federation sent out a shipment of donated boats to help to grow a sport which carries with it significant financial entry barriers. It was on these boats that Noble learned to row skull (individual), as opposed to her time rowing crew (as a team in one boat) at university. Whilst the thought of training on Lake Victoria, one of Africa\u2019s Great Lakes and the world\u2019s largest tropical lake, may bring with it a sense of charm and serenity, trying to prepare to compete at Olympic level just isn\u2019t feasible given the lack of opportunities and investment afforded to rowing within Uganda, a reality which sees Noble now train out of Tennessee under former US rower James Martinez. \u201cThere is no history of rowing in Uganda. I mean, I\u2019m literally the first person, male or female, to even qualify for the Olympics,\u201d Noble says. \u201cIt is still extremely niche, and the community is very small. I probably know every single rower in the country personally. \u201cBack in 2016, I took eight months off from university to row in Uganda and I\u2019m so grateful that I did because I got to experience first-hand all the struggles that rowers back home go through on a daily basis. \u201cNot only is there a lack of competition and adequate coaching, but there is a lack of most basic essentials, such as having properly functioning equipment. \u201cWhen I was rowing on Lake Victoria, we were still using the boats donated back in 2009. We would be duct-taping them and trying to get people to patch them up with fiberglass for us.\u201d It is not just a lack of equipment which has hampered rowing\u2019s growth in the east African country. Governance is also a major issue, and the absence of proper oversight has seen many athletes leave the sport in recent times, according to Noble, due to \u201cpromises being made but not always being kept.\u201d The only way the sport has a chance to progress is through the help and funding from outside donors such as the World Rowing Federation. Muhumuza Rodrick Chandi,\u00a0the technical director of the Uganda\u00a0Rowing Federation, tells CNN Sport that the price of equipment and a lack of coaches has been an issue in the country. \u201cIt is true that there is a lack of coaches as most qualified ones have left Uganda in search of greener pastures,\u201d he says.\u00a0\u201cRowing, like most sports in Uganda, is voluntary, so once these coaches get better opportunities they migrate or leave the sport altogether. \u201cThe Ugandan Rowing Federation does suffer from a lack of funding, mainly because it doesn\u2019t get much budgetary support from the National Council of Sports as it\u2019s considered a small sport.\u201d \u2018Honor\u2019 representing Uganda Born in Nakaseke, central Uganda, in 1994, Noble is the daughter of Irish missionaries. \u201cUganda was a fantastic place to grow up in many ways, whether it be the great weather all year round or the friendly and cheerful nature of the people,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut as a White, blonde child, I maybe would have had an aversion to going out in public due to the amount of attention I\u2019d have gotten.\u201d Despite her differences, of which Noble is acutely aware, sport has allowed her to form a deeper connection with her birthplace. \u201cEven though I have Ugandan citizenship, there is an identity to being Ugandan which is about coming from one of the local tribes and having land and a history and ancestors going back a long way,\u201d she says. \u201cI respect that, but at the same time, I did grow up in Uganda. It\u2019s a place that is important to me and it does mean a lot to me to have people accept me as being Ugandan. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge honor to represent my country. It\u2019s been the way that I\u2019ve felt the most connection to my identity as a Ugandan. Growing up there, when people ask you where you\u2019re from, I would say Ireland, even though I was born and grew up there. \u201cBut I feel like as I\u2019ve gotten deeper into representing and rowing for the country, I have felt more strongly that I am Ugandan.\u201d Noble\u2019s acceptance by Ugandan sports fans has also been a great source of encouragement. While she says that she will occasionally receive the odd message on social media criticizing her for representing the country, the overwhelming majority of both fan and media messaging has been support and pride for raising the profile of Ugandan rowing. \u201cYou\u2019re always going to have haters and people who want to try to knock you down, that\u2019s kind of to be expected in high level sport nowadays with social media \u2026 but I find it extremely touching that whenever I am met with negativity, a barrage of positivity will follow,\u201d says Noble. \u201cI\u2019m very, very grateful for that.\u201d Platform for change Noble, on top of her sporting ambitions, works as a software engineer in Tennessee and, alongside her husband, is a homesteader with a small-scale farm producing food and animals for themselves. Like every athlete, she hopes that her Olympic journey will culminate atop the podium, but she does also head to Paris with a compelling sense of realism. \u201cRowing is not really a sport where you wake up and just have a great day and row faster than you ever have before,\u201d says Noble. \u201cIt is a little bit more deterministic than that. Sports that are really based around cardiovascular strength tend to remove that element of major surprise around results. I\u2019m not going to flat out say that my goal isn\u2019t to medal, but at the same time I need to be realistic.\u201d Winning a medal is not the only means by which you can determine an Olympian\u2019s success, though, with Noble hoping that her exposure during the Games can help to elevate rowing back in Uganda, ensuring that she is no longer its sole representative. \u201cI feel a sense of responsibility to try and help support athletes back home,\u201d she says. \u201cWhether that correlates to me having to do well, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily true. I get a lot of press whether I come first or last. \u201cI believe that the actual position that I come is less important than the spotlight that exists around the Olympics. That gives me the platform to raise awareness about the limitations and struggles that athletes have in Uganda to a global audience.\u201d Rowing, particularly singles rowing, can be a very isolating sport, a fact that Noble can attest to.

The Turkish defender gave his side the perfect start after just 57 seconds, blasting home from close range following some pinball in the Austria box which almost resulted in an own goal. Demiral got his second of the game when the defender powered a header home shortly before the hour mark. Just when it seemed Turkey was on its way to the quarterfinals, Michael Gregoritsch halved the deficit to give Austria hope of rescuing the game. As the rain poured down in Leipzig, Austria had a golden chance to level the scores in added time, but Christoph Baumgartner\u2019s header was brilliantly pushed away to safety by goalkeeper Mert G\u00fcnok as Turkey held on for a famous victory. The game was played at a frenzied pace, with both teams known for their high-pressing football and both sets of fans bringing plenty of energy to the Leipzig Stadium. Turkey will play the Netherlands in the quarterfinal in Berlin on Saturday, July 6. Fast-paced action The atmosphere inside the Leipzig Stadium ahead of kickoff was electric \u2013 thanks to the Turkish diaspora in Germany and many Austrians making the short journey over the border \u2013 with the pace of the game matching the fervent noise inside the ground. Turkey was quick to capitalize on that fast start, forcing a corner in the opening minute. Austria struggled to deal with the set piece and although goalkeeper Patrick Pentz flicked the ball away, it was Demiral who pounced to smash his shot into the roof of the net. Austria looked set to level the scores when Baumgartner came rushing in at the near post with the goal gaping. Somehow Baumgartner was unable to make contact with the ball, instead clashing with the upright. The first half continued in a breakneck fashion, with 19-year-old Turkey forward Arda\u00a0G\u00fcler attempting an outrageous lob from the halfway line. Austria came out in the second half with a refreshed sense of purpose and had a golden opportunity to equalize when Marko Arnautovi\u0107 was slipped through on goal but his effort was denied by G\u00fcnok who spread himself to deny the Austrian captain. Stefan Posch was the next Austrian player to go close but the defender was unable to get a clean connection with the goal at his mercy. With Austria seemingly in the ascendancy, Turkey counterpunched to double its lead. Once again, it was 26-year-old Demiral who was the scorer, rising highest from G\u00fcler\u2019s corner to get his second of the game. The goal seemed to have given Turkey a safety net, but Austria halved the deficit seven minutes later, Gregoritsch finishing smartly from a corner to breath new life into the game. Austria kept pushing and when Baumgartner rose highest with seconds to spare, his header looked like it was heading for the net, but Turkey\u2019s goalkeeper G\u00fcnok flew to his right to push the ball away and seal Turkey\u2019s spot in the quarterfinals.

That\u2019s the odds of making two holes-in-one in a single round, according to the National Hole-In-One Registry. On Friday, Frank Bensel Jr. made two in a row. While some of the game\u2019s most talented players wait years \u2013 even entire careers \u2013 for an ace, the 56-year-old went back-to-back in a remarkable few minutes at the second round of the US Senior Open. The Jupiter, Florida-native tore through the par-three fourth and fifth holes of Rhode Island\u2019s Newport Country Club in just two swings, going 184 yards from tee to cup before acing again from 203 yards mere minutes later. Four consecutive bogeys immediately afterwards may have undone the Floridian\u2019s tournament progress, lifting him to one-over par for the round and six-over overall, but his near-miraculous efforts enter him into a league of his own. No golfer has ever made back-to-back aces in any Tour-sanctioned event on record, according to the PGA Tour Champions: a professional tour for golfers aged 50 and over which is hosting the third of five major championships this week. Ireland\u2019s Seamus Power made consecutive holes-in-one at Augusta National last year, but did so during the pre-tournament Par Three contest as opposed to the Masters itself. A hole-in-one is made just once every 3,500 rounds across more than 500 million rounds played in the United States each year, according to data compiled by the National Hole-In-One Registry, which has logged more than 108,000 \u201cvalid\u201d aces since 2006. An \u201caverage\u201d player has a 12,000 to one chance of making an ace, four times less likely than the odds of a Tour player holing one, the registry states. \u201cTruly historic,\u201d tournament organizer the United States Golf Association (USGA) wrote in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, sharing Bensel Jr.\u2019s scorecard. Bensel Jr. has played six events on the PGA Tour since 1998, most recently at the 2021 PGA Championship, though is yet to make the cut. His appearance at the US Senior Open marks his third on the PGA Tour Champions and the first since a 77th place finish at the Senior PGA Championship in 2021. Sunday\u2019s victor will claim an $800,000 cut of a $4 million prize purse, with Bernhard Langer seeking to defend his crown. Last year\u2019s victory \u2013 Langer\u2019s 46th on the PGA Tour Champions and 12th senior major \u2013 saw the two-time Masters winner become the most successful golfer in the circuit\u2019s history.

{"id": "2024_07_01_sport_ukraine-athletes-paris-olympics-spt-intl", "text": "Kateryna Tabashnyk couldn\u2019t hold back her tears \u2013 not necessarily because her attempt to qualify for her first Olympics had fallen short, but because she was now reflecting on all the grief and pain of the past two-and-a-half years. The 30-year-old high jumper cleared 1.89 meters at the Ukrainian Athletics Championships on Sunday, not enough to qualify for this year\u2019s Olympic Games in Paris. But the fact that she had even come so close was a testament to her remarkable willpower and perseverance. Tabashnyk\u2019s mother was killed in a Russian airstrike on Kharkiv two years ago. She had stayed in the eastern city to help her young nephew, who was seriously injured in an earlier attack by Russian forces. Tabashnyk decided to return to competition a month later, viewing sport as a means to honor her mother\u2019s life even in the depths of grief. \u201cOf course, it affects people and, of course, me \u2013 the loss of my home, the loss of my dear mother, the loss of friends,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cAll this takes strength, takes energy. It\u2019s like a poison for the body.\u201d \u201cWe have to prepare to compete and show results against this background. Of course, it\u2019s very hard, it\u2019s very difficult, but to be honest, I don\u2019t know where I\u2019ve been getting this energy, this strength for the last two years. It\u2019s something incredible, even for me.\u201d Ukraine will send a team of more than 100 athletes to Paris, and \u2013 though that\u2019s fewer than the country had in Tokyo three years ago \u2013 their participation will likely feel more significant. The Ukrainian athletes competing at the games have endured a myriad of challenges since Russia\u2019s invasion, including facilities being destroyed, friends and relatives being killed and uncertainty about what the future might hold. According to Ukraine\u2019s Sports Ministry, about 3,000 athletes \u2013 from Olympic and non-Olympic sports \u2013 have served for the country\u2019s military, either voluntarily or by being drafted, and 479 have been killed while serving or in civilian life. More than 500 sports facilities have been destroyed, including 15 Olympic training bases. Tabashnyk won bronze at the European Indoor Championships earlier this year \u2013 her first medal at a major event \u2013 and was hoping to be part of Ukraine\u2019s first Olympic team since Russia launched its full-scale invasion with the support of Belarus in February 2022. She had been confident of making the team before a recent injury hampered her preparation for the national championships in Lviv. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how many times I wanted to give it all up, give up on sports, on jumping,\u201d Tabashnyk said. \u201cBut every time I pull myself together and say, \u2018No, now I have to fight like never before.\u2019 And so it goes every time, no matter what obstacle stands in my way.\u201d She is far from the only Ukrainian athlete whose life has been scarred by Russia\u2019s invasion of their country. Many athletes have moved abroad in order to continue their careers and train for this year\u2019s Games. That includes 400-meter hurdler Viktoriia Tkachuk, who has become accustomed to undertaking the 46-hour trip from Ukraine to her training camp in South Africa. Tkachuk\u2019s brother was called up to the frontline in May last year, and since then, her whole family has been fraught with fear about his safety. \u201cWe were all stressed out because we were thinking, \u2018Oh, no, he\u2019s not ready yet, he cannot go there,\u2019\u201d the 29-year-old told CNN. \u201cBut we were doing our best to support him, because if he\u2019s worrying, then he will feel our worries and it will not help him.\u201d Tkachuk saw her brother in February when he had a break from military service, and the pair are in regular contact while they go about their separate lives. \u201cHe\u2019s texted me a message: \u2018You will win there, and I will win here,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cSomething like this. \u2026 He has in his pocket \u2013 close to his heart \u2013 small pictures with us together, our family, and he said this picture is always with him. It\u2019s nice to know this.\u201d Having already qualified for the Olympics, a minor injury prevented Tkachuk from competing in Lviv, where CNN spoke to several athletes looking to secure a spot on the team. Despite Russia\u2019s invasion casting a long shadow over Ukraine\u2019s participation at these Olympics, there was a vibrant atmosphere at the event, and most athletes were excited by the chance to compete for an Olympic berth. \u201cNow, with a big team under our flag, we take part in a big Olympic movement, we take part in the biggest contest, and the entire world is looking at us,\u201d Matviy Bidnyi, Ukraine\u2019s acting sports minister, told CNN. \u201cAll of the world awaits what we will do in the Olympic Games, what we can show in the Olympic Games \u2013 that our country, which is in a condition of war now, is in a good shape.\u201d \u201cThis is a very important mission,\u201d he added, \u201cand all our athletes understand their responsibility in it.\u201d Whether Russian and Belarusian athletes should be permitted to compete at this year\u2019s Olympics, which begin on July 26, has been the topic of intense debate, especially for Ukrainian athletes and officials. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has said that Russian and Belarusians can compete as Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs) in Paris, provided that they meet certain eligibility requirements. This means that teams of Russian and Belarusian athletes will not be considered, while athletes who actively support the war against Ukraine will also be ineligible. No reference to either country will be made at the Games through the athletes\u2019 participation, such as flags, anthems or national colors. The IOC ruled that it would be unfair to punish athletes based on their passports alone, but many people in Ukraine were hoping for a more stringent stance. \u201cWe think that this position is strong enough,\u201d said Bidnyi, \u201cbut we think it would be better if they were banned totally.\u201d There will be no Russians or Belarusians taking part in track and field events in Paris as governing body World Athletics has banned athletes from these two countries from competing at an elite level \u2013 the only Olympic sports federation to have done so. This means that athletes like Tkachuk will avoid the potentially challenging situation of lining up against competitors whose nations are at war with her country, irrespective of how they are presented at the Games. \u201cThis is really nice to know, for my brother also, that I\u2019m not going to competitions to run with Russians, or to speak with Russians, or to deal with something that I don\u2019t need,\u201d she said. Her teammate, fellow 400m hurdler Anna Ryzhykova, agrees. \u201cWe\u2019re not friends, we\u2019re not competitors,\u201d Ryzhykova told CNN about facing Russian and Belarusian athletes. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a right to be at the Olympics \u2026 because every one [of them] is guilty in some way.\u201d Like Tkachuk, Ryzhykova has had to spend time away from Ukraine while she trains and competes, basing herself in the Italian city of Brescia during the summer months. But being away from her family home in Dnipro isn\u2019t always easy. \u201cHome is my safe place where I can recharge, relax, where I feel good, where I can really rest between competitions or in my training life,\u201d says the 34-year-old, a 4x400m relay bronze medalist at the 2012 London Olympics. \u201cIn the training camps, it\u2019s totally different in other countries; it\u2019s good, some countries are really amazing, but it\u2019s not my native (country). I can\u2019t relax fully there.\u201d Ryzhykova has learned not to read the news on the days she has a competition, which means finding different ways to distract herself whenever thoughts of the war enter her mind. \u201cI use books, novels or something easier,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I have bad thoughts, I\u2019m going back to this novel, and [thinking], OK, what is my character doing? I need to concentrate on this. It\u2019s my plan for competition day.\u201d CNN\u2019s Svitlana Vlasova contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/sport/ukraine-athletes-paris-olympics-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Dynastic hot dog eating champion Joey Chestnut was not competing, of course, after the 16-time winner struck a deal with plant-based food company Impossible Foods. Bertoletti pulled ahead in the closing minutes to win with 58 hot dogs, after one of the closest races in recent years. Nathan\u2019s Famous competition got underway in historic fashion with the women\u2019s contest as reigning champion Miki Sudo broke a women\u2019s record by eating 51 hot dogs and buns. She beat second place Mayoi Ebihara by 14 hot dogs and buns to secure her 10th title at the contest. \u201cWe finally beat 50, guys,\u201d Sudo told ESPN after her historic performance. \u201cI\u2019ll see you next year.\u201d Bertoletti bested Geoffrey Esper (53) and James Webb (52), who rounded out the top three. This was Bertoletti\u2019s first title in his ninth career appearance, according to the ESPN2 broadcast. But there was a Chestnut-shaped hole in this year\u2019s event. The maestro of mastication has won the \u201cMustard Yellow Belt\u201d 16 times, and ate a world record 76 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes in 2021. If Chestnut was absent from Nathan\u2019s Famous contest, he wasn\u2019t going to allow Independence Day to pass by without taking on a food challenge. The 40-year-old competed in his own live-streamed showcase event, taking on four US Army soldiers at the Fort Bliss base in El Paso, Texas, in an \u201call-beef\u201d hot dog eating event that raised money for military families. Chestnut devoured 57 hot dogs in five minutes while the soldiers he competed against maxed out at a combined 49. \u201cHot dogs on the Fourth of July in front of people who are celebrating America \u2013 it doesn\u2019t get any better than this,\u201d Chestnut said with a championship belt along his shoulder. With 106 total hot dogs eaten, $106,000 was raised and donated to military families. Chestnut had reportedly said he hoped to eat more hotdogs in five minutes than the winner of Nathan\u2019s competition does in 10 minutes. \u201cI think 56 is doable,\u2019\u2019 he had said, per USA Today. \u201cI\u2019d be very happy to do that.\u2019\u2019 What about next year? The Major League Eating (MLE) organization, which oversees the world-renowned event, has emphasized that Chestnut is not banned for life from competing, citing his 20-year relationship with the league. The organization said that, to come back, Chestnut must renounce deals with brands that rival Nathan\u2019s. \u201cJoey Chestnut is an American hero. We would love nothing more than to have him at Nathan\u2019s Famous International Hot Dog Eating Contest, which he has dominated for years. We hope that he returns when he is not representing a rival brand,\u201d MLE said in a statement. An account under Chestnut\u2019s name posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, Tuesday that he does \u201cnot have a contract with MLE or Nathans and they are looking to change the rules from past years as it relates to other partners I can work with.\u201d CNN has not independently confirmed the authenticity of the X account.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/sport/nathans-famous-hot-dog-eating-contest-joey-chestnut-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "sports"}}

The 28-year-old,\u00a0as well as being Malian,\u00a0is a French citizen, and a multiple-platinum-selling pop star who was brought up in the Parisian suburbs. However,\u00a0ahead of Paris 2024, Nakamura finds herself at the\u00a0center\u00a0of France\u2019s culture wars. Amid widespread\u00a0rumors\u00a0the singer would\u00a0perform at the Games\u2019 Opening Ceremony, singing an Edith Piaf song,\u00a0some members of France\u2019s far-right have questioned\u00a0whether she embodies French heritage, values and identity.\u00a0Piaf is a key figure in France\u2019s musical \u2013 and national \u2013 identity. \u201cThere\u2019s no way Aya. This is Paris, not the market\u00a0in\u00a0Bamako,\u201d said fringe\u00a0and extreme\u00a0far-right group Les Natifs (Natives) on X, formerly known\u00a0as Twitter, in March, referring to Mali\u2019s capital. Nakamura has defended herself on social media, saying on X: \u201cI\u2019m becoming the number one state subject in debates\u00a0\u2026but what do I really owe you all? Nothing.\u201d The singer has received support from Rachida Dati, France\u2019s Minister of Culture, who spoke out in defence of Nakamura, saying \u201cbe careful of the pretext of attacking someone out of pure racism.\u201d Paris 2024\u2019s organizing committee told CNN: \u201cWe were very shocked by the racist attacks against Aya Nakamura in recent days. We offer our full support to the most listened-to French artist in the world.\u201d Whether Nakamura will perform at the Olympics\u2019 opening ceremony is still unconfirmed, with the Paris 2024 organizing committee telling CNN that they\u00a0\u201cwon\u2019t be confirming or denying\u201d\u00a0any rumors or reports, to \u201cleave room for surprises\u201d on the day. CNN has reached out to Nakamura but she declined to\u00a0be interviewed\u00a0on the matter. \u2018She contributes to French culture\u2019 However, many others in France are all too keen to comment on this cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. Far-right politician Marion Mar\u00e9chal,\u00a0who is the niece\u00a0of far-right National Rally party leader\u00a0Marine Le Pen and a member of the\u00a0Reconqu\u00eate\u00a0party, told French\u00a0television stations BMFTV and Europe 1\u00a0that Nakamura\u00a0\u201cdoes not sing in French,\u201d referencing the blend of Parisian and African\u00a0derived slang\u00a0that often feature in her lyrics. \u201cI think that the people who criticize her actually don\u2019t accept that she embodies France,\u201d\u00a0French activist Rokhaya Diallo told CNN. \u201cThe\u00a0slang she uses is used by young people and a lot of young French people use slang.\u201d Nakamura often uses a mix of verlan and African derived slang from languages such as Bambara, from her birth country Mali,\u00a0in her music. Her number one hit song\u00a0\u201cDjadja,\u201d\u00a0contains the lyric \u201cle monde est tit-pe\u201d \u2013 the world is small \u2013 with word \u2018tit-pe\u2019 inverting the French word \u2018petit.\u2019 Verlan, a type of French slang named after\u00a0the inversion of the French word \u2018l\u2019envers\u2019 \u2013 meaning backwards \u2013 originates from the outskirts of Paris known as \u2018la cit\u00e9\u2019 (the suburbs)\u00a0that have had\u00a0large\u00a0immigrant population. At the inauguration of the\u00a0Olympic Aquatics Centre\u00a0earlier this month, French President Emanuel Macron\u00a0said that Nakamura \u201cspeaks to a good number of our compatriots\u201d and claimed that \u201cthese\u00a0games and ceremonies should reflect us, and she contributes to French culture, to French music.\u201d \u201cI want to defend here these choices and defend the fact that there must be artistic freedom and that politics should not interfere,\u201d added Macron. In an interview with France Inter,\u00a0Macron\u2019s political rival Le Pen, known for her right-wing views, claimed that the President was seeking to \u201coutrage\u201d and \u201chumiliate the French people\u201d when asked whether she thinks Nakamura opening the games would be a\u00a0good symbol. When asked to further explain why this choice would be a humiliation, Le Pen responded \u201cshe does not sing in French, or a foreign language, she sings nonsense.\u201d Speaking to CNN, Professor of Political Science at the University of Nice,\u00a0Vincent\u00a0Martigny, said that\u00a0while\u00a0there are those who believe it is right to promote minorities and their role in French culture, there are others, who hold more traditional views, which he terms as racist in relation to the country\u2019s colonial past. 1998 World Cup There have been moments of\u00a0perceived\u00a0unity in France\u2019s past, notably when the men\u2019s national soccer team won the 1998 World Cup. That triumph helped popularise the slogan \u201cBlack, Blanc, Beur\u201d \u2013 Black, White, Arab\u00a0\u00a0\u2013\u00a0amid a push for unity and inclusion. Beur\u2019 is verlan for the French word \u2018arabe.\u2019 France\u2019s World Cup winning team of 1998\u00a0was made up of a\u00a0diverse\u00a0group\u00a0of players,\u00a0not only of European descent but also from the ex-colonies of France\u00a0and other countries.\u00a0Many thought\u00a0at the time\u00a0that the 1998 team was a sign of a truly integrated, multi-cultural France. But notable social and cultural divisions have emerged in France in recent years. There have been\u00a0multiple bans and restrictions against Islamic dress. The nationwide ban on\u00a0public\u00a0schoolchildren wearing abayas,\u00a0was\u00a0denounced as an \u201cIslamophobic campaign\u201d by\u00a0one\u00a0politician\u00a0on the left.\u00a0Athletes have been banned\u00a0from wearing a hijab while competing representing France\u00a0at the Paris\u00a0Olympic Games. Then there have been multiple protests and riots over police brutality leading to the death of\u00a0some French inhabitants of North and West African heritage\u00a0from the suburbs of Paris, fueling backlash over policing methods in marginalized communities. Nakamura\u2019s\u00a0birth\u00a0country\u00a0of Mali is one of the many\u00a0former\u00a0French colonies. There are millions of French citizens, like Nakamura, who are either themselves immigrants or descendants of immigrants from\u00a0nations formerly colonized by France. These days France\u00a0finds itself embroiled in a very public debate over the recognition and acceptance of its immigrants as the country continues to reckon with its colonial history. Professor Martigny believes that the\u00a0nationalist\u00a0party is \u201cstronger than ever\u201d and that nationalists in France are \u201cmore nationalist\u201d and more open with their views today than they were in the past. Activist Diallo also believes that France is struggling to see itself \u201cas it is\u201d and recognize non-White individuals as fully French. \u201cDespite her successes, despite her undeniable achievements, we still think that it\u2019s not an honor for us to have such a woman represent us,\u201d Diallo told CNN, referring to Nakamura. \u2018The Great Replacement\u2019 theory Political scientist Oliver Roy, who is Professor\u00a0at the EUI School of Transnational Governance, told CNN that a common belief that could be fuelling the culture wars in France is an ideology\u00a0expressed\u00a0\u201cnot just [by] the extreme right, but also part of the traditional centre right\u201d known as \u201cthe great replacement.\u201d He describes\u00a0the term\u00a0as \u201cthe idea that there is a new population coming from the south, which is replacing the old traditional, French population.\u201d However, he maintains that this fear \u201cis not supported by demography, [or] by statistics, and is, of course, very ideological.\u201d According to Martigny, France\u2019s cultural divisions are amplified on social media by both extremes of the political spectrum. \u201cBecause of the social networks, public debates are more violent on these issues than they used to be,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a theatre for the expression of extremely strong minded, sometimes racist, very often offensive comments on Twitter, on X, and on other social networks,\u201d added Martigny. \u201cYou have a lot of X accounts who are really, really, really pro far-right. And so they played a role in discussing these issues and making it a controversy. And then this controversy is exported to the traditional media.\u201d \u2018Show a very optimistic face for France\u2019 As Nakamura was targeted by fringe and extreme far-right groups as well as far-right politicians, in an interview\u00a0with BMFTV and RMC,\u00a0Macron said that \u201cthe reactions shocked me \u2026 there\u00a0were\u00a0truly racist reactions.\u201d However,\u00a0Martigny says he sees\u00a0Macron\u2019s condemnation of the attacks as racist as an attempt to balance the scales after the passing of\u00a0what the professor called\u00a0a \u201cvery restrictive law on immigration\u201d a few months ago. In December, Macron passed a controversial bill calling for tougher immigration that was endorsed by the far-right, and rejected by many in his own camp. Politicians such as Le Pen hailed the legislation as an \u201cideological victory\u201d whilst French health Minister, Aurelien Rousseau resigned in protest.\u00a0It included many amendments tightening immigration laws, one of which dictated children born to foreign parents on French soil would no longer become automatic French citizens but would have to apply for citizenship. \u201cHe needs to make that forgotten in a certain way by showing that he has a sense of balance on these issues,\u201d\u00a0Martigny states. By promoting Nakamura, Martigny believes that Macron\u2019s ambitions may have been to \u201cshow a very optimistic face for France.\u201d \u201c[There are] very strong cultural wars in France revolving around pop stars, and the type of pop stars that you can mobilize or the type of artists that you can mobilize when you want to unite the country.\u201d With less than 100 days to go until the Olympics, many hope Paris 2024 will give France the opportunity to show unity. However, the heated reactions to Nakamura hints at a more pessimistic outlook.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/26/sport/aya-nakamura-france-culture-wars-paris-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "sports"}}

The captain for France\u2019s national soccer team, who is preparing for Les Bleus\u2019 Euro 2024 quarterfinal against Portugal in Hamburg on Friday, urged the French public to vote saying \u201cnow more than ever\u201d it was needed. \u201cThere\u2019s an emergency, we can\u2019t let our country in the hands of these people, it\u2019s really urgent,\u201d Mbappe said at a media conference in Hamburg, Germany. President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s shock announcement in June to call snap parliamentary elections plunged France into political uncertainty and has roiled financial markets, with the far right having a shot at real political power. After a high turnout at the polls, last Sunday the RN clinched 33.15% of the vote, while the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) coalition came second and President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s party slumped to third. If the RN assumes power, it would become the first far-right party to enter the French government since\u00a0World War\u00a0II\u00a0\u2013 although nothing is certain\u00a0ahead of Sunday\u2019s\u00a0second round.

Navarro needed just 59 minutes to ease past four-time grand slam champion Osaka, who recorded her first win at Wimbledon since 2018 against Diana Parry in the first round. Now ranked No. 113 in the world, Osaka was competing as a wildcard at Wimbledon this year.\u00a0The Japanese star\u00a0returned to tennis\u00a0at the start of 2024 after more than a year away from the sport prioritizing her mental health and then\u00a0becoming a mother. Osaka, who has won all four of her grand slam titles on hard courts, still hasn\u2019t been past the third round at Wimbledon. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was the greatest from my end,\u201d Osaka said, per PA. \u201cI feel like even though in the beginning it was kind of like we were trading games, I don\u2019t know why, I didn\u2019t feel fully confident in myself. I didn\u2019t feel like I was playing that well. \u201cI guess those doubts started trickling in a lot into my game. Obviously the second set wasn\u2019t that great. I don\u2019t know why those thoughts were so prevalent. \u201cI\u2019m a little disappointed because I wanted to do really well. I feel like I put a lot of time into it. There\u2019s always next year.\u201d While Osaka\u2019s grass court season is over, the 26-year-old has shown enough form throughout the year to suggest she could be a real threat on the hard courts again. Navarro, the 2021 NCAA champion, has enjoyed a breakout year on the tour and has now reached at least the third round of all three grand slams this season. The 23-year-old was ranked 149th in the world at the start of last season but has now soared to the world No. 17 position and looks a real threat in SW19 after reaching the semfinals of the Bad Homburg Open in the lead up to Wimbledon. \u201cIt\u2019s my first time on Centre Court. It doesn\u2019t really seem to be real,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cI\u2019ve been having a lot of fun on grass. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of been the theme of my time on tour so far, just trying to really enjoy myself \u2013 and today was no exception. So I\u2019m just having a lot of fun and it was a really special atmosphere.\u201d Navarro will face Diana Shnaider in the third round after the Russian 20-year-old breezed past former US Open champion Sloane Stephens in straight sets, winning 6-1 6-1.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/sport/naomi-osaka-wimbledon-emma-navarro-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2022_07_25_sport_black-representation-swimming-equality-spt-intl", "text": "Omie Dale has fond memories of splashing in the sea as a child, of racing through water parks and swimming in backwaters and rivers.   \u201cThere\u2019s so much joy that can be had once you learn to swim, once you\u2019ve abandoned those fears and you can get in the water,\u201d the 25-year-old Dale, who is based in southeast London, tells CNN Sport.  Even though swimming is a joyful experience for Dale, the stark reality is that many Black communities in Britain and the US do not have safe access to swimming lessons and public pools due to historic racism and segregation \u2013 a problem that is especially alarming given that, as Dale says, it is \u201cthe only sport that can save your life.\u201d  A history of exclusion The lack of access afforded to Black communities in Britain is what motivated Dale to become a swimming teacher in September 2019.  \u201cI used to work in Kensington (in London) as a lifeguard and some of the richest people live in that borough, but also some of the poorest,\u201d she says. She saw there was a difference when private schools and independent schools would come in and all the kids were able to swim, yet hardly any children of the same age that Dale saw from state schools could swim 25 meters.  \u201cThere\u2019s a real class barrier in the sport of swimming,\u201d Dale adds.   She is a director of Swimunity, a collective offering free swimming lessons to women and children in North Kensington, West London. It was born in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster in 2017, when a residential block caught on fire, killing 72 people \u2013 and leaving many more without homes.   \u201cThere\u2019s like a lot of people who come to swim lessons \u2026 who have undergone some form of trauma, whether that be water-related trauma or trauma related to their everyday lives,\u201d Dale says.   \u201cMany people say it\u2019s like an escape from their daily lives or is, actually, the first time that they\u2019ve taken time for themselves.\u201d  While 77% of children from the most affluent families in England can swim 25 meters unaided, only 34% from the least affluent families can, according to a 2021 survey from Sport England, a non-departmental public body that fosters grassroots sports in England.  About 95% of Black adults and 80% of Black children in England do not regularly participate in swimming, according to Sport England\u2019s report, published in January 2020. Likewise, about 93% of Asian adults and 78% of Asian children, including those with Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi heritage, do not regularly participate in swimming, the same research found. This trend extends to the US, where nearly 64% of Black children have \u201clow\u201d or no ability to swim, compared with 40% of their White peers, according to 2017 data from the country\u2019s national governing body for the sport at a competitive level, USA Swimming.   The underrepresentation of Black people in the pool in the US can be traced back to the early 20th century.   Public swimming pools became popular in North America in the 1920s and 30s and were initially open to all. However, Northern politicians stipulated a \u201cWhites Only\u201d rule, referencing racist fears about Black men fraternizing with White women.   Even after legal racial segregation ended in the US in 1964, public pools continued to be hostile environments. As people of color began to use public pools, White swimmers retreated to the privacy of their own pools and private clubs, where expensive fees continue to be an economic barrier for Black families who cannot afford the cost.    Similar examples in Britain illustrate how racial and class inequalities lead to the systemic exclusion of Black people in pools. For example, more than 4.2 million people in the UK live in ethnically diverse communities where Covid-19 national lockdowns resulted in the closure or mothballing of pools, according to Swim England \u2013 England\u2019s national swimming governing body \u2013 and the Black Swimming Association (BSA), a UK-based charity that aims to encourage more African, Caribbean and Asian communities to take up swimming.  \u2018We cannot keep recovering bodies\u2019  Globally, drowning is the third leading cause of accidental injury-related death and at least 236,000 people die each year from drowning, according to 2019 data from the World Health Organization (WHO). Children are particularly affected, with drowning being one of the top five causes of death for those aged 1-14 years in 48 of 85 countries studied by the WHO.   And while natural disasters and irregular migration are notorious risk factors, so are lower socioeconomic status, lack of higher education and being a member of an ethnic minority, depending on the country, WHO research shows.  \u201cMost drowning incidents happen when people never intend to get into the water in the first place,\u201d says Dale, who was awarded Swim Teacher of the Year by Swim England in 2021.  In December 2019, three members of the same Black British family \u2013 a 53-year-old father and his two children \u2013 died in a swimming pool at a resort in Costa del Sol, Spain, Reuters reported. The father and his 16-year-old son had reportedly leapt into the water to try to save his nine-year-old daughter, who was drowning.   Danielle Obe is the co-founder and chair of the BSA. She told CNN Sport that the Costa del Sol deaths prompted her to establish the BSA in March 2020, alongside Olympic swimmer Alice Dearing, journalist Seren Jones and songwriter, rapper and producer Ed Accura.    \u201cThis was devastating because these families were actually acquainted to me and they were from my local community,\u201d Obe says. \u201c(At) that point, I called Alice and Seren, and I said, \u2018We\u2019ve been talking about doing something for our community. We\u2019ve got to do something. We\u2019ve got to do it now. We cannot keep recovering bodies.\u2019\u201d   \u201cIt\u2019s no longer just about that lack of representation,\u201d Obe adds.   \u201cIt\u2019s now about saving lives, vital water safety, education for all. Swimming is an intervention. Swimming is a life skill.\u201d  However, there is still a lack of data when it comes to drowning-related deaths by ethnicity in the UK, says Obe.  \u201cAt the moment, we don\u2019t know how much of a disparity there is between drowning and fatalities, aquatic fatalities for different communities in the UK because, up until now, drowning data isn\u2019t really captured by ethnicity, which is another point, another issue that the BSA is looking to tackle.\u201d \u2018People just don\u2019t think Black people should swim\u2019  Dearing, the first Black female swimmer to represent Britain at the Olympics when she competed at Tokyo 2020, \u201cimplores\u201d people to learn to swim.   \u201cI have been quite torn between the amazing achievement of being the first Black woman to represent GB in swimming but wanting to be my own person, my own athlete, who\u2019s known for being an athlete and not for her race and her sport combined together,\u201d she tells CNN Sport. \u201cI take the two of them just as they are \u2013 kind of like separate things. I\u2019m trying to be the best athlete and best role model that I can be to show people that they can do the sport, that the sport is for everybody.\u201d At the age of 24, Dearing was making history in Japan and became a beacon of hope for young people \u2013 especially Black girls \u2013 who wanted to break into the sport.   But her personal triumph also drew attention to the institutional access gap for people of color in swimming.    \u201cFortunately, for myself, I haven\u2019t come across any barriers at the level I\u2019m at currently,\u201d Dearing says.   \u201cBut I have faced barriers when I was younger and issues where people just don\u2019t think Black people should swim, or do swim, or think that we\u2019re better suited to other sports and so shouldn\u2019t even learn to swim or attempt swimming in the first place.\u201d  CNN reached out to the International Swimming Federation (FINA), Sport England and USA Swimming requesting a breakdown of Black and ethnic minority participation in swimming at grassroots and professional levels of the sport. However, they told CNN they were unable to provide such data.  FINA \u2013 the global governing body for swimming \u2013 told CNN it does not have a breakdown of the ethnicities of swimmers at a grassroots or elite level.   FINA said in 2021 it allocated $6.6 million towards development programs for distribution among all national federations and continental associations, while also pushing for diversity in the sport through its \u201cSwimming for All, Swimming for Life\u201d program.   \u201cFINA remains fully committed to non-discrimination,\u201d the organization said to CNN in a statement. \u201cFINA continues to work hard to ensure that the global aquatics community is a place where all athletes, coaches and administrators are treated equally. \u201cWork will continue to develop and grow with the support of members of the aquatics community as we strive to be at the forefront of this essential area,\u201d FINA added.    Sport England told CNN in a statement that it is \u201ccommitted to increasing investment in facilities and organisations across England to try to level up access to good quality sports and activities.\u201d \u201cBarriers to getting active persist and have even been exacerbated for some disadvantaged groups \u2013 like women, people with long-term health conditions, disabled people, people from ethnically diverse communities and lower socio-economic groups,\u201d the statement added.   Sport England said in May it announced further funding that brings its total investment in its 121 partners to more than \u00a3550 million ($670 million), which they\u2019ve selected \u201cdue to their unique position to tackle entrenched activity inequalities and influence positive change throughout the sector, their own networks and beyond.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s not all about the economic side of things. It is also about getting people to feel comfortable with putting their kids in swim lessons and in competitive swimming so that they can then go and do other aquatic-based sports,\u201d Joel Shinofield, the managing director of sport development at USA Swimming, told CNN during a phone call.  USA Swimming is a membership-serviced organization that has over 3,100 clubs and more than 400,000 members, according to the official website.   \u201cOur goal is to facilitate opportunities and make sure they\u2019re good ones. While our clubs are the ones that do that on the local level, the resources, guidance, support, financial investment that we provide can shift who those opportunities can be provided to and more broadly create access,\u201d he added.   Shinofield said that USA Swimming has established a 10-year initiative that will grant $1 million to develop learn-to-swim and competitive opportunities for communities served by Historical Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The program was announced in 2021, according to the USA Swimming official website.   Serving underrepresented communities  From representing their organization at the UK\u2019s first Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Summit For Sport in Birmingham, England earlier this year to facilitating swimming classes in Hackney \u2013 one of the most deprived boroughs in London \u2013 Obe hopes that the BSA will help bridge the barrier through community-level engagement.   \u201cThat community engagement really is to build trust, accountability and collaboration with disenfranchised communities and the sector,\u201d says Obe.  \u201cOnly in understanding these attitudes and understanding some of the barriers that preclude our communities from engaging in aquatics can we begin to drive change.\u201d  In August 2021, the BSA announced it would conduct a research program with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the University of Portsmouth, exploring the behaviors and barriers that prevent African, Caribbean and Asian communities from swimming.    Speaking about the program, Obe says: \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to inspire confidence with African, Caribbean and Asian communities, and the only way we\u2019re able to do that is to ensure that we understand where these communities are in the first place and understand why they don\u2019t engage in aquatics, why we don\u2019t see the representation pool side and why we don\u2019t even see the representation within some aquatic organizations.\u201d  Dale also volunteers with Mental Health Swims, a grassroots organization that facilitates swimming meet-ups for people struggling with their mental health. As part of her work for the organization, she coordinates swim events in south London to help swimmers access the mental health benefits of the sport. She also volunteers for Pride in Water, a network that aims to increase LGBTQ+ representation in swimming.   \u2018The future is bright\u2019  Dearing says that despite the racial and economic barriers to swimming for African, Caribbean and Asian communities, she\u2019s still optimistic about the changing landscape of the sport.  \u201cI really think if anything is going to change, it\u2019s going to be now, it\u2019s going to be over the next couple of years,\u201d she says. \u201cEach story is different, each person is different and has to be understood in their own way, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, that\u2019s just another challenge that we have to face and we\u2019re up for it.  \u201cIt\u2019s tough \u2013 it\u2019s not a quick fix, but the future is bright.  \u201cI like to feel that I\u2019m giving something back to swimming and, hopefully, giving something to the Black community to hopefully achieve, strive for and change the way that Black people are viewed in swimming and the way Black people view swimming.  \u201cIt\u2019s a double-edged sword; I absolutely love doing it. Sometimes, it\u2019s really frightening and daunting, but if I\u2019m trying to make the world a better place, then sometimes you got to step out and scare yourself.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/07/25/sport/black-representation-swimming-equality-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Once upon a time, an internal monologue of insecurity \u2013 \u2018Man, I\u2019m stinking today\u2019 \u2013 would have been the soundtrack to the American\u2019s march past the masses. These days, though, it\u2019s an entirely different voice \u2013 one that leads him to pause at the ropes and make the day of one enraptured young fan. \u201cI throw a few more golf balls out than I ever have \u2026 Not only does it make them happy, but it makes me happy,\u201d Spieth told CNN Sport\u2019s Patrick Snell. \u201cIt\u2019s cool to see a kid smile. I\u2019m like, \u2018Man, if my son was out here, he wouldn\u2019t care what that guy did on the previous hole or tournament. He just knows who he is for whatever reason and he wants a high five.\u2019\u201d Make no mistake, Spieth is as hungry as ever to continue populating his trophy cabinet, but fatherhood and Father Time have recalibrated the three-time major champion\u2019s outlook. At 30 years old, Spieth is far from a veteran. Yet 11 years, 276 events and 13 wins into his PGA Tour career, the former world No. 1 already experienced and witnessed more than many golfers will in a lifetime. Sporting immortality still beckons, with Spieth just one PGA Championship victory away from becoming only the sixth player in history to clinch all four professional majors, but the Texan is eyeing a legacy that can be measured in more than just silverware. \u201cYou start to realize that the trophies and all that, it\u2019s great and it happens, but they are a blip in time,\u201d he said. \u201cThat you can make somebody feel good, how you make somebody feel, is significantly more important than how you entertain them once. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to lose perspective when you\u2019re in the middle of competition, but the more [you play], you can recognize it\u2019s just a game and the impact we have can be way more important than that entertainment when we pass by on that one hole.\u201d Back to the start Spieth\u2019s latest effort to deliver such an impact takes the form of the \u201cCrush It! Cup\u201d \u2013 a youth golf tournament and fundraiser staged at the place where his journey began. On September 16, Brookhaven Country Club in Dallas will play host to a competition of 36 junior golfers who will have earned their place on the field based on their efforts in a two-month long Golf Marathon Fundraiser. The campaign will run across 26 states at 150 golf clubs owned by Invited, the largest owner and operator of private membership clubs in the US that partnered with Spieth in 2022. Spieth will host a golf clinic for the top 100 fundraisers before playing alongside each young golfer for one hole at Brookhaven \u2013 coincidentally both his and Invited\u2019s first club. As the sun sets, he will take a seat beside the flames to anchor a Fireside chat with competitors. The host is expecting some \u201ccrazy\u201d questions, many stemming from Netflix\u2019s fly-on-the-wall golf docuseries \u201cFull Swing,\u201d but is just as interested in what he can take from those asking them. \u201cThese kids, you watch them \u2013 their focus, their desire \u2013 they\u2019re so nice and then the second it\u2019s their turn to hit, they \u2013 the competitive nature sinks in,\u201d Spieth said. \u201cI\u2019m really excited to just watch kids be kids. We just kind of lose sight of it professionally sometimes. We get involved in more of the business and technical sides of things and it\u2019s really fun to just be around a bunch of kids playing golf. \u201cIt reminds us why we love the game and we should never forget that.\u201d Money raised will head to the Jordan Spieth Family Foundation, which was built to raise awareness of and fund four key \u201cpillars\u201d: junior golf, military veterans, pediatric cancer and children with special needs. Spieth launched the endeavor as a 19-year-old rookie in large part due to his younger sister Ellie, who has autism. More than a decade on, his sibling continues to inspire. \u201cIt\u2019s a love, a support, a perspective that a lot of other people don\u2019t necessarily have,\u201d Spieth said. \u201cI\u2019ve always said that we\u2019re blessed because we get to watch her. It\u2019s raw emotion and her joy is just pure joy \u2013 there\u2019s no faking. It\u2019s fun to watch her be and it\u2019s fun to support her as she\u2019s always been there to support us.\u201d \u2018He\u2019s doing more for the game of golf than any professional golfer is doing\u2019 While Spieth is confident that junior golf is becoming increasingly diverse, he believes \u201cquite a bit\u201d of work is still left to be done at the grassroots level of the sport in terms of inclusivity. Poetically, the biggest driver for change may lie outside the traditional channels. While Spieth is pleased with the efforts his foundation is making \u2013 such as supporting the PGA Junior League, First Tee and other nonprofits \u2013 he is left awestruck by the influence of NBA icon Steph Curry. An avid \u2013 and rather talented \u2013 golfer himself, Golden State Warriors star Curry launched his \u201cUnderrated Golf Tour\u201d in 2022, offering an all-expenses paid competitive opportunity for underrepresented young players. Ahead of last month\u2019s US Open, the four-time NBA champion was presented with the Charlie Sifford Award, a prize \u2013 named after the PGA Tour\u2019s first Black player \u2013 bestowed by the World Golf Hall of Fame that honors those advancing diversity in golf. For Spieth, there could not have been a more worthy recipient. \u201cHe\u2019s doing more for the game of golf than any professional golfer is doing,\u201d Spieth insists.\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely remarkable.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re trying to help where we can, but some people like Steph have bigger platforms and it\u2019s really cool with the stuff he\u2019s doing. As much as we try to help, he\u2019s got the opportunity and he\u2019s acting on it tenfold.\u201d As the major season culminates with the Open Championship in Scotland on July 18, Spieth\u2019s sights are firmly trained on more major glory. Yet should the 2017 champion not get his hands on a second Claret Jug, he will take some comfort if he hears one of his favorite soundbites from beyond the ropes at Royal Troon. \u201cKids coming up and saying, \u2018I didn\u2019t play the game of golf \u2018til I watched you and then I wanted to take it up.\u2019 It\u2019s really neat when you hear that,\u201d Spieth said. \u201cBecause I love the game, and I know that the game is a really good pathway into creating good human beings going forward. \u201cI never really got into it for that. I just loved it myself and I loved competing and so I just wanted to keep doing it. You don\u2019t really realize until later on that, if you do it the right way, it can have that kind of impact and bring somebody else into the game.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/sport/jordan-spieth-crush-it-cup-golf-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_sport_carlin-dunne-death-anniversary-spt-intl", "text": "Romie Gallardo always knew the risks her son Carlin Dunne faced when he raced motorbikes. As a youngster he\u2019d asked his mother if she wanted him to stop racing, but she never considered that as an option. They had a longstanding agreement that she\u2019d follow his races from his home, keeping things running and looking after his Australian cattle dog, Sonny. It was comforting for Dunne to know that his mom would look after his pup if anything went wrong. In 2019, Dunne was in his element, charging up the iconic Pikes Peak in Colorado, powering his Ducati Streetfighter up to 14,000 feet, towards the clouds, towards what appeared to be a fifth victory out of five attempts and yet another record time. He had rounded the 156th and final turn, and he was within sight of the finish line when disaster struck; he lost control and crashed. \u2018Born with speed in his blood\u2019 Australian rider Rennie Scaysbrook had been the penultimate rider that day and was being interviewed by a television crew at the top when he began to wonder why Dunne hadn\u2019t pulled up alongside him. \u201cThere was just something about Carlin and that mountain,\u201d Scaysbrook told CNN. \u201cWhatever it was, they just worked so well together. He was designed to ride that place.\u201d According to his mother, Dunne was born with speed in his blood. \u201cHis father was a motorcycle racer,\u201d she explained to CNN, \u201cso it was a given that when I produced a son that he was going to be on two wheels. I mean, his very first motorcycle was a little Suzuki RM50, and we had that before I brought him home from the hospital.\u201d Having learned on the Suzuki, he graduated to a Honda 75, and by the time he was around 12, he was racing an Ascot 500 at Willow Springs near Los Angeles. His mother could see how much he enjoyed it, but she also knew that he was only going to get faster. \u201cWe had several talks over the years, and he\u2019d ask me, \u2018Do you want me to quit racing?\u2019 And I said, \u2018No, because it\u2019s what you do. It\u2019s your passion; you love it. You happen to be really good at it. I\u2019m not in charge of your happiness and if you\u2019re doing something that makes you happy then that\u2019s all I can really ask for.\u2019\u201d \u2018Nature and nurture\u2019 Jason Chinnock signed Dunne to the Ducati team in 2012 and the company\u2019s North American CEO told CNN that his family background played a crucial role in his development as a racer. \u201cHis father was a professional racer,\u201d Chinnock explained, \u201cand on the other side, a mother who was incredibly loving and supportive. There\u2019s nature and nurture, and he had a nice combination of both. \u201cSome riders are boisterous and loud; they\u2019re a little too confident, as if they\u2019re trying to make up for a lack of talent,\u201d added Chinnock. \u201cHe [Dunne] was exactly the opposite; he had this cool, calm demeanor. Those are the guys you have to watch out for, the guys who don\u2019t have to use their mouth.\u201d Dunne was magnetically attracted to anything with two wheels: BMX, mountain bikes, dirt bikes and street bikes, and he built a community of friends through their shared love of the lifestyle. The three-time Dutch Mountain Bike champion Anneke Beerten told CNN that Dunne was her \u201cadventure buddy.\u201d She says they once spent Christmas Eve in the hospital because he\u2019d broken his foot riding dirt bikes, \u201cand he was still in a good mood!\u201d Beerten says she felt \u201calive\u201d whenever she was around him. Marcus Boyle met Dunne when he was working at his Ducati shop in Santa Barbara, and they subsequently became friends. After a massive mudslide damaged his family\u2019s Montecito property in 2018, Dunne helped turn their wrecked back yard into an off-road adventure park. \u201cI owe all of my skill and passion to Carlin\u2019s determination to push me to become a better rider,\u201d explained Boyle. \u201cWe all admired Carlin\u2019s charisma, and he was always able to seem calm regardless of his own high-pressure circumstances.\u201d Dunne\u2019s memories of his single mother working three jobs to pay for his leathers and make ends meet compelled him to support the rookies who were coming through without any support or encouragement of their own. \u201cHe was just a great guy to be around,\u201d Scaysbrook enthused. \u201cHe\u2019s one of those dudes that was impossible not to like, which really sucked when you were trying to beat him!\u201d The Australian rider remembers Dunne\u2019s kindness in his rookie year, \u201cHe didn\u2019t have to give me all this information. He just did it because he could; he wanted to see me do well.\u201d According to Chinnock, Dunne gave up a year of riding one year to mentor people that were going to be new to Pikes Peak. \u201cEven those that were going to race against him in the future. I mean, this is how selfless he was.\u201d \u2018You can\u2019t make it a safe race\u2019 Pikes Peak demanded perfection, though, especially on a motorbike.\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s so many variables on a racecourse like this,\u201d Dunne told CNN in one of his final interviews.  \u201cEverything from animals, weather, this place is a living, breathing organism. You have to take it seriously. It\u2019s very humbling when you get up there.\u201d Asked to describe just how dangerous it was on a motorbike, Dunne scored it as 10 out of 10. In the years leading up to the 2019 race, the road had been upgraded from a partial dirt track to a fully paved surface and a number of riders had been killed. Scaysbrook says he was lucky when he crashed over the Armco barrier in 2016 but was able to return to his bike and finish the race. Another rider crashed at the same turn and was fortunate just to survive. \u201cThe guy that ran the motorcycle program would always say, \u2018No one crash or get hurt, because if someone gets hurt, this whole thing stops,\u2019\u201d recalled Scaysbrook.\u00a0\u201cAnd I\u2019m like yeah, thanks, mate. Like, we need any more motivation not to throw ourselves off a fricking cliff!\u201d Scaysbrook\u2019s last memory of Dunne was on the start line at Pikes Peak in 2019. Scaysbrook says felt a tap on his shoulder, they shook hands and said they\u2019d see each other at the top. Dunne almost made it to the finish line; he was so close that the first person to reach him after the crash was the man who would have been waving the checkered flag. Race officials estimated that he was on course to break his own record time. Dunne\u2019s fateful race was also the last time that anyone raced a motorbike up the mountain; Scaysbrook was the last rider to do it and live. \u201cI\u2019ve got the trophy downstairs, but I\u2019d give it back to finish second and have Carlin still here in a heartbeat. Wouldn\u2019t even be a consideration.\u201d Everybody that CNN spoke with understood why the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb could no longer stomach such extreme risks, but they all agree that it\u2019s not the legacy Dunne would have wished for. \u201cI know he would be super bummed that the program was canceled because of what happened to him,\u201d his mom said. \u201cBut the reality is that you can\u2019t make it a safe race.\u201d Dunne\u2019s legacy Gallardo teared up when describing what she misses most about her son. \u201cI miss talking with him versus talking about him. Carlin was gregarious; he had a good sense of humor, almost all of it was self-deprecating. He was very thoughtful and considerate. He made people feel like they were the only people in existence.\u201d Friends and family are keen to preserve Dunne\u2019s legacy in any way that they can. In 2022, Scaysbrook made his debut at the Isle of Mann TT races, and he put Dunne\u2019s No. 5 on his bike, taking him around a track that he never got to race while he was alive. \u201cTo this day, for those of us who knew him, we have a saying, \u2018live like Carlin,\u2019\u201d explained Chinnock. \u201cThat\u2019s become our own internal hashtag for doing something that pushes us and challenges us to make us a better person.\u201d At the age of 36, Dunne was starting to find fulfilment away from his bike. He was using his talents on film in stunt work and dreaming of a long and happy life. But he told CNN that he would always live life in the fast lane. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll be at the home for the elderly, getting tickets on my rascal scooter,\u201d he chuckled.\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t imagine slowing down; it\u2019s the moment you slow down that you really become old.\u201d On June 30, 2019, at more than 14,000 feet up on the mountain that he\u2019d conquered so many times, Dunne was travelling at full speed on a prototype Ducati Streetfighter when he died. Everybody that loved him knew that his story could end that way, but there\u2019s still nothing that can soften the blow and it\u2019s of little consolation to know that he died whilst doing the thing he loved most. \u201cI always thought that the \u2018doing what you love thing\u2019 is B.S.,\u201d said Scaysbrook. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to die doing what you love; you want to die as an old person in your bed, surrounded by your loved ones. You don\u2019t want your passion to hurt you like that.\u201d But his mother, who keeps her son\u2019s Honda 75 in her living room, disagrees. \u201cHe asked me again, in one of our final conversations, \u2018Do you want me to quit?\u2019 And I said that if it was time for him to go, there would be a certain amount of comfort for me knowing that he was doing what he loved, you know, versus getting hit by a drunk driver or a drive-by shooting. \u201cIf you support somebody in a sport that you could ultimately lose them, you have to support them 100%. I came to that acceptance a long time ago. He passed with his boots on and, just, in his element.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/sport/carlin-dunne-death-anniversary-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2023_09_20_sport_saudi-arabia-soccer-spl-bin-salman-intl-spt-cmd-dg", "text": "When Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal reportedly planned a $1.1 billion bid to sign French soccer superstar Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 \u2013 including $332 million to his club, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), and an eye-watering $775 million salary packet to the World Cup winner for just one year \u2013 it was slammed by critics as sportswashing. Mbapp\u00e9 might have said no to the offer in July, but a month later, Neymar Jr. said yes to Al-Hilal, as the Brazil star moved from PSG for a transfer fee of around $98.5 million (\u20ac90 million) plus add-ons, according to multiple reports. In a record-breaking transfer window, Saudi Pro League (SPL) clubs spent close to $1 billion, acquiring 94 overseas players from Europe\u2019s major leagues \u2013 France\u2019s Ligue 1, Spain\u2019s La Liga, Italy\u2019s Serie A, Germany\u2019s Bundesliga and the English Premier League \u2013 according to Deloitte. Despite the Arab nation\u2019s poor human rights record, Saudi Arabia\u2019s spending spree to turn its domestic soccer league into a star-studded, bona fide competition shows the seriousness of its ambition. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman says he doesn\u2019t \u201ccare\u201d about the country\u2019s investment in sport being described as sportswashing. \u201cWell if sportswashing is going to increase my GDP by one percent, then I will continue doing sportswashing,\u201d MBS said in an\u00a0interview\u00a0with Fox News which aired Wednesday. Pressed on if he was bothered by the use of the term, MBS continued: \u201cI don\u2019t care. I have one percent GDP growth from sport, and I am aiming for another one and a half percent. Call it whatever you want, we\u2019re going to get that one and a half percent.\u201d Saudi clubs, several of which have been taken over by the nation\u2019s sovereign Public Investment Fund (PIF), have already attracted some of the biggest names in the sport. By attracting some of the world\u2019s biggest stars to the Gulf states, the SPL wants \u201cto drive competitiveness on and off the pitch,\u201d though it\u2019s keen to emphasize that these overseas players will help develop \u201cyoung Saudi talent.\u201d During this summer transfer window, the government-controlled PIF increased the cumulative value of these four clubs nearly five times, making them the most valuable in the country, according to estimates by the sports website Transfermarkt. Plenty of other leading stars have eagerly said yes to the SPL, notably 2022 Ballon D\u2019Or winner Karim Benzema joining Al-Ittihad at the end of his contract with Spanish soccer giant Real Madrid. As the European transfer window came to a close, the four PIF-owned teams have spent nearly $900 million (\u20ac835.1 million) on buying elite international players, Transfermarkt data shows, which ranked them in the top 20 clubs in the world by transfer expenditure, alongside soccer giants from England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy. Al Hilal alone paid more than $378 million (\u20ac353 million), more than PSG and Arsenal, making it the second-largest spender this year. The newly acquired players join five-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, who has a two-year contract with Al-Nassr where he will earn a staggering estimated $200 million a year, according to Saudi state-owned media, currently making him the world\u2019s highest paid soccer player. As of today, 21 of the most expensive soccer players in Saudi Arabia by transfer fees \u2013 all international stars \u2013 play for one of the PIF-owned clubs. Despite the financial outlay, the SPL is remaining deliberately tight-lipped about the specifics of its financial gamble, with chief operating officer Carlo Nohra confirming to CNN Sport that it was \u201cnot in [the SPL\u2019s] competitive advantage\u201d to report the salaries offered to players and coaches. The PIF has $777 billion in assets under management, according to its most recent filing, with ambitions to top $1 trillion within a few years. In 2021, it acquired English soccer club Newcastle United, before focusing on investments at home. The club is now also among top spenders on players. Saudi clubs not owned by the PIF are also splurging on big-ticket players, with former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson, 33, offered an eye-watering salary of $870,000 (\u00a3700,000) per week, according to multiple reports, in an estimated $15 million (\u00a312 million) transfer from Liverpool to Saudi team Al-Ettifaq. In a recent interview with The Athletic, Henderson said those numbers \u201cjust aren\u2019t true.\u201d \u201cEssentially, the signal is \u2018We mean business,\u2019\u201d Simon Chadwick, a professor of sport and geopolitical economy at SKEMA Business School, told CNN.\u201cWe\u2019ve got so much money that for a player who is \u2026 coming towards the end of his career, we can afford to pay him 700,000 [GB pounds a week], or whatever it is that he\u2019s being paid, and still have Cristiano Ronaldo and still be in the market for other players as well,\u201d Chadwick said, describing Saudi\u2019s approach to becoming a sporting superpower, adding that the sky is the limit in terms of cost. Saudi\u2019s love of soccer Saudi Arabia follows in the footsteps of several other countries \u2013 including China and Qatar in investing large sums of money to try and turn themselves into soccer powerhouses. It remains to be seen whether Saudi\u2019s turbocharged investment will have a lasting impact or resemble something like a costly rebranding effort. The Saudi national team has been to multiple World Cups, and the country\u2019s clubs have won multiple Asian titles. Saudi\u2019s victory over Argentina during last year\u2019s men\u2019s World Cup was hailed as one of the greatest upsets in tournament history, with the country\u2019s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud granting a national public holiday in recognition of the win. Club games can attract huge crowds in the Middle Eastern nation. \u201cFor example, Al-Ittihad against Al-Hilal, you\u2019re talking about drawing crowds of 40, 50, 60,000 people, these are games that are comparable in size to Chelsea vs. Arsenal, Manchester United vs. Manchester City,\u201d Chadwick said. Buying star players, some arguably past their prime, also provides an easy win for Saudi teams, according to Kieran Maguire, co-host of \u201cThe Price of Football\u201d podcast. \u201cFrom the Saudi authorities\u2019 point of view, they\u2019re getting a ready-made product. Everybody\u2019s heard of Benzema. Everybody\u2019s heard of Cristiano Ronaldo and so on,\u201d Maguire said. Saudi Arabia\u2019s lofty sporting ambitions don\u2019t end with the SPL or Newcastle United. The country is hosting the 2023 FIFA Club World Cup and is bidding to host the 2027 AFC Asian Cup. Several media reports also indicated that the Gulf kingdom was considering launching a bid for the 2030 FIFA men\u2019s World Cup alongside Greece and Egypt \u2013 although it is reportedly mulling pulling its candidacy. Meanwhile, the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) has agreed to a contract that will see the Spanish Super Cup played in Saudi Arabia until 2029, a deal that will earn the Spanish governing body between \u20ac35-45 million ($38-48 million) a year. Appealing to the youth Saudi Arabia has a very young population: the country\u2019s most recent census revealed 32.2 million people live in the country, nearly 42% of whom are foreign nationals \u2013 and 51% of the Saudi population are under the age of 30.\u202fOf this populace, Saudi authorities say that over 80% play, attend or follow soccer, the national sport. Chadwick explains that Saudi Arabia\u2019s government is concerned with the prospect of its younger members of society becoming radicalized or an anti-government sentiment bubbling up like that of the Arab Spring \u2013 and looks to offer its population a thriving soccer industry to keep it placated. Though the soccer industry generates employment, revenues, export earnings and inward investment, \u201cwhat is just as significant is the security of the royal family,\u201d Chadwick adds. The Arab Spring, a wave of pro-democracy protests that washed over the Middle East and North Africa in 2011, achieved mixed results. Four Arab dictators in Libya, Yemen, Egypt and Tunisia were toppled, offering a brief sense of victory for protesters, but, since then, new wars have prompted a retreat of popular movements in the region. Meanwhile, failed uprisings in Bahrain and eastern Saudi Arabia were followed by years-long crackdowns and a continuing civil war in Syria. \u201cWhat we\u2019re beginning to see in Saudi Arabia right now is the emergence of a new social contract. And the social contract essentially is catering for the needs of the Gen Z population,\u201d Chadwick said. \u201cYou want Ronaldo? You got him. You want some of the best football teams in the world? You got them. You want the World Cup to come to Saudi Arabia? You got it \u2026 But don\u2019t question us,\u201d Chadwick explained. Maguire agrees, noting that investing in soccer \u201ccan be seen as part of a much broader socio-economic plan, run by the Saudi authorities.\u201d At the same time, there has been \u201ca significant increase in the number of Saudi Arabians detained by the authorities, for example, for posting adverse comments on social media about the country\u201d this year, Chadwick told CNN. Human rights group Amnesty International told CNN that it has documented a rollback in human rights in Saudi Arabia, including an escalating crackdown on freedom of expression and an increased use of counterterrorism and cybercrime laws to silence dissent. Between 2022 and 2023, the organization said it has documented an increase in criminal prosecutions compared to previous years. In 2022, Amnesty reported the highest number of annual executions in the country in 30 years, with 196 people killed. \u201cReputation is important in terms of attracting foreign investment, and \u2026 Mohammed bin Salman, as much as he has significant financial muscle, needs foreign investing for the realization of his diversification,\u201d James Dorsey, the author of the syndicated column and blog, \u201cThe Turbulent World of Middle East Soccer,\u201d explains. Saudi Arabia is the world\u2019s biggest exporter of crude oil, and nearly two-thirds of its income still comes from selling fossil fuels. But with oil prices regularly dipping below what the Gulf state needs to balance its budget, it has focused efforts on trying to bring in investment from abroad along with its efforts to raise oil prices. Projections indicate the kingdom has around 20 years to diversify its economy to ensure it is more resilient, according to Chadwick \u2013 not least to fund its Vision 2030 projects, including the $500 billion Neom city, a 106 mile-long linear city called The Line and a futuristic plan to revamp the capital. \u201cPart of the grand vision of Mohammed bin Salman, looking forward to 2030, he does have his desire to make Saudi Arabia less dependent on natural resources to look at a post-fuel economy [involving] tourism, entertainment. If Saudi Arabia can become a hub for major sporting events, then that\u2019s a way of attracting interest to the country,\u201d said Maguire. CNN has reached out to the Saudi Ministry of Sport for comment on allegations that the kingdom has been rolling back human rights, and investing in soccer as a way of \u201csportswashing\u201d its image. In response to previous criticism about Saudi Arabia\u2019s purported \u201csportswashing,\u201d the kingdom\u2019s sports minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal said: \u201cPeople that don\u2019t know Saudi Arabia, have never been to Saudi Arabia, go out and talk about it as if they\u2019ve lived there for 30 years, 40 years. So I always tell people, come to Saudi. Come and see Saudi. \u201cSee what it is, see the people, meet the people. Look at what the country is doing for the future of the people in Saudi, then you can criticize as much as you like,\u201d he added. Lack of transparency: Saudi threatens new systems of governance\u202fin sports Saudi Arabia has already disrupted the golf industry and, with soccer, Maguire told CNN, \u201cthey feel that they can do that probably on a smaller scale, but perhaps, ultimately, to generate more interest in terms of eyeballs if they go down the same route.\u201d In 2021, the Saudi government-controlled PIF bankrolled LIV Golf, reportedly at a cost of $2 billion, attracting many of the sport\u2019s top players away from the US-based PGA Tour and Europe-based DP World Tour by offering big dollar prize money, with PGA Tour board member Jimmy Dunne raising fears that they might end up \u201cowning golf.\u201d Earlier this year, the US-based PGA Tour announced it was set to partner with the Saudi-backed breakaway LIV Golf, ending a feud that has dogged the men\u2019s professional game for the past year, with Dunne warning that sport\u2019s governing body had no choice but to reach the truce to retain some measure of control. \u201cThey have an unlimited horizon and an unlimited amount of money,\u201d he said at a contentious Senate hearing on the truce between the two tours. When it comes to soccer, Aleksander Ceferin, president of European football\u2019s governing body UEFA, has dismissed the competitive threat that the SPL could pose. \u201cAs far as I know, Mbappe and [Erling] Haaland don\u2019t dream of Saudi Arabia. I don\u2019t believe that the best players at the pinnacle of their careers would go to Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said last month. \u201cWhen people talk to me about the players who went there, nobody knows where they\u2019re playing.\u201d Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp took a different view, referring to the fact that the Saudi summer transfer window stays open after European clubs see theirs close: \u201cI don\u2019t know how stable it is and I think the next two weeks will show how much of a challenge it is because whatever happens there, no one can react anymore. \u201cI don\u2019t know where it will lead to but it feels rather like a threat or a concern than not because I can\u2019t see how we really deny it in these moments, what can we do?\u201d he added. Still, the new SPL director of football, Michael Emenalo, says what Saudi soccer is doing is \u201cno different from what the Premier League have done.\u201d \u201cThere was a time when it was all about Italy. There was a time when it was all about Spain. What we\u2019re looking for in the industry is an opportunity to compete, and to compete on an even scale and to improve upon whatever exists in the industry,\u201d said Emenalo in a press release sent to CNN. New Saudi Pro League Chief Operating Officer Carlo Nohra told CNN that there is logic behind the league\u2019s strategy of money is no object to lure international stars. \u201cWe can\u2019t expect to be paying market value to entice people to come here at this early stage in our development.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0But analysts say that the difference lies in the level of transparency, which \u201csimply doesn\u2019t exist in Saudi Arabia,\u201d Chadwick explained to CNN. European soccer governing body UEFA has financial fair play (FFP) rules on teams\u2019 spending, while Major League Soccer in the US has a salary cap for its clubs. Nohra told CNN that, eventually, the country wants 0.3% of its GDP to be from soccer to make it similar to that of the Premier League on the UK economy \u2013 up from its current value of \u201c0.000 something.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve got no chance to get into that figure at present,\u201d Maguire explained, but added that the SPL could perhaps move into the top 10 of the world\u2019s domestic leagues. \u201cThat is feasible given the amount of money that they\u2019re spending.\u201d \u201cI think they\u2019re realistic. They don\u2019t say that they\u2019re going to overtake La Liga or the Premier League or the major European leagues,\u201d Maguire said. When the Peterson Institute for International Economics compared the world\u2019s sovereign wealth funds on criteria including governance, transparency and accountability in 2019, the PIF scored well below average on a measure combining these criteria, and ranked in the bottom 10 out of 64 funds, just above Russian Direct Investment Fund. CNN has reached out to the PIF for further comment about its investments in sport, particularly soccer and golf, and criticisms about its lack of transparency. Chadwick raised concerns over how a lack of financial rules affecting Saudi clubs might dilute UEFA\u2019s FFP regulations, as well as those of the Premier League, or impact world soccer governing body FIFA\u2019s systems of governance. The lack of transparency in Saudi Arabia\u2019s wealth fund has already raised suspicions in the US golfing and political spheres. Earlier this summer, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations launched an inquiry about the PGA Tour\u2019s agreement with the PIF-controlled LIV Golf. Chadwick told CNN that, so long as there is no independent organization that monitors the reporting of every league\u2019s financial endeavors, \u201cnobody really knows for sure what the accurate financial information is.\u201d \u201cThis vacuum [of information], this uncertainty is wrapped in a veneer of lobbying, which is intended to either overinflate or underinflate player transfer values and salary information because it serves a political purpose,\u201d Chadwick says, adding that this purpose is \u201csignaling.\u201d \u201cIt is almost as though football players are becoming kind of geopolitical pawns in some ways.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/09/20/sport/saudi-arabia-soccer-spl-bin-salman-intl-spt-cmd-dg/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "sports"}}

This is the first time two rookies are WNBA All-Stars in the same season since 2014. Reese, who has also been named WNBA Rookie of the Month for June, was emotional after learning about her All-Star selection. \u201cI\u2019m just so happy,\u201d she told reporters through tears. \u201cAll the work I put in, coming into this league so many people doubted me \u2013 didn\u2019t think my game would translate and I wouldn\u2019t be the player that I was in college \u2026 I trusted the process and I believed.\u201d Against the Atlanta Dream on Tuesday, Reese posted her 11th consecutive double-double \u2013 extending her single-season league record \u2013 with a franchise-record 19 rebounds in the Sky\u2019s 85-77 win. She is now within one of Candace Parker\u2019s all-time record for consecutive double-doubles, which was accomplished across two seasons. Clark, meanwhile, was named Rookie of the Month in May and has consistently drawn huge crowds during her time in the WNBA. On Tuesday, 20,366 watched her Fever lose 88-69 against the Las Vegas Aces, the fifth-biggest crowd in league history and largest since 1999. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been her teammate before, even at USA Basketball or anything like that,\u201d Clark told reporters about linking up with former college rival Reese. \u201cI know people are going to be really excited about it, but I hope it doesn\u2019t take away from everybody else. \u201cThis is a huge accomplishment for everybody on Team USA and everybody on Team WNBA. They all deserve the same praise.\u201d Joining the two first-timers on the 12-woman Team WNBA roster are two-time All-Star Aliyah Boston (Fever), four-time All-Star Arike Ogunbowale (Dallas Wings) and nine-time All-Star Nneka Ogwumike (Seattle Storm). Team WNBA will take on the USA Basketball Women\u2019s National Team at the Footprint Center in Phoenix for a sold-out game on July 20. Six-time All-Star A\u2019ja Wilson of the Las Vegas Aces headlines the Team USA squad for the 20th All-Star game. Joining Wilson are six-time All-Star Breanna Stewart (New York Liberty), 11-time All-Star Diana Taurasi (Phoenix Mercury) and 10-time All-Star Brittney Griner (Mercury). This will be the second time the All-Star game will feature the USA Basketball vs. Team WNBA format. In 2021, Team WNBA defeated Team USA 93-85 in Las Vegas prior to the Tokyo Olympics. The All-Stars were chosen by fans (50% of the vote), current WNBA players (25%) and a national panel of broadcasters and sportswriters (25%).", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/sport/wnba-all-stars-caitlin-clark-angel-reese/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/05/2024", "section": "sports"}}
