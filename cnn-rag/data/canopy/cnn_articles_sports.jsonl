Fenian refers to a group of 19th\u00a0century Irish revolutionaries but is widely recognized as a derogatory term for Irish Catholics. The language mirrors the division caused by centuries of war and strife between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, in part because of the west of Scotland\u2019s close historical links with Northern Ireland. \u201cOver recent years supporters\u2019 unacceptable conduct has become rife in Scotland whether that be through the use of pyrotechnics, sectarianism, objects being thrown onto the field of play or through other actions,\u201d Hibernian FC, commonly known as Hibs said in a statement in response to the chanting. Police Scotland told CNN it had received no reports regarding fans\u2019 behavior towards Boyle. A spokesperson added: \u201cI can confirm a man was arrested in connection with comments being made towards Rangers fans/staff, however, he was released without charge.\u201d David Scott, director of Nil by Mouth \u2013 a Scottish charity that campaigns against religious bigotry \u2013 told CNN \u201csectarianism is something that\u2019s very woven into the game of football.\u201d He explained that \u201cpassion, performance, poison\u201d are at the heart of the game in Scotland, with bigoted chanting taking the forefront. \u201cIt was a historic problem born of the Catholic-Protestant divide in Scottish society, especially in the West of Scotland. And it became greatly manifest in football,\u201d Scottish sports journalist Graham Spiers told CNN. \u201cThat in the main has meant anti-Catholic chanting. This is not anti-Protestant. It\u2019s not anti-Asian, it\u2019s not anti-Semitic. In the main, it has been about anti-Catholic and anti-Irish chanting,\u201d Spiers added. A problem rooted in history The fierce rivalry between Glasgow\u2019s two most famous teams \u2013 Celtic FC and Rangers \u2013 is historically one of the most vivid examples of sectarianism in Scottish football, and society. The two teams play each other in Saturday\u2019s Scottish Cup final. Historically chants have included anti-Catholic religious bigotry, or vocal support for paramilitary groups like the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). Celtic, founded by an Irish member of a Catholic religious order in 1887, wears its heritage proudly in the four-leaf clover of its team emblem. Meanwhile, Rangers, founded in 1872, was \u201chistorically and shamefully\u201d a mostly Protestant club until the 1980s, Spiers explained. \u201cRangers didn\u2019t hide it, they were proud of the fact they were all Protestant,\u201d he said. These historically religious identities and rivalries \u2013 often described as \u201cScotland\u2019s shame\u201d \u2013 extend to other Scottish clubs, including Edinburgh\u2019s historically Catholic Hibernian and Protestant Hearts of Midlothian FC. Perhaps the most violent chapter in the sectarian sports rivalry happened in 1995, when 16-year-old Celtic fan Mark Scott was killed by a man who police say had family links to a Protestant paramilitary group.  Scott was wearing a Celtic scarf while walking past a pub frequented by Loyalist fans on his way home from a match on the day of his murder. Jason Campbell was arrested, tried and convicted in 1996 for the killing. He was sentenced to life in prison but was freed on parole in 2011 following human rights legislation. And though Scotland has become more secular than when these clubs were founded some 150 years ago, \u201cthese tribal loyalties remain,\u201d said Nil by Mouth\u2019s Scott. \u201cWhen you\u2019re singing and chanting these things, you may think you\u2019re just thinking about your tradition, your background, but actually other people may just hear the hatred and agonism,\u201d said Scott. \u201cAcross the city, people will sing songs, \u2018We\u2019re up to our knees in Fenian blood, surrender or you\u2019ll die.\u2019 \u201cThey will tell you that, \u2018This is just theater, these are just words that don\u2019t mean anything, these are football chants,\u2019 that people like me are taking it too seriously. It\u2019s all culture. But it can also be a very intimidating atmosphere to be at,\u201d Scott added. According to Spiers, Celtic\u2019s support is \u201cmaybe 70% Catholic, but with a very large Protestant minority, who are Celtic fans. And they also have songs about \u2018Orange [named after King William III, also known as William of Orange and a political society] bastards,\u2019 meaning Protestants.\u201d Geographically, these are clubs whose support cuts across the geography of Scotland as well as social class, said Scott. \u201cPeople don\u2019t go to church anymore,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople don\u2019t live in these kinds of working class communities in Scotland where they used to do \u2013 people are more spread out. I think football becomes this kind of social cement that links people to parts of their past.\u201d Authorities have tried to tackle the problem, introducing legislation including The Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Act 2012, which was repealed in 2018. \u201cIf you\u2019re watching football matches with five or 10,000 people or whatever it is shouting and chanting, you can\u2019t arrest them. So you have to come up with a system of addressing that,\u201d Scott explained. There were 576 charges with a religious aggravation reported in 2022-23 according to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS), an 8% increase on the previous 12 months. The COPFS reports that \u201cover the last five years, the number of religious charges reported has fluctuated between around 530 and 670 per year.\u201d This April, Scotland\u2019s new hate crime law came into force, which focuses on \u201cstirring up hatred,\u201d \u201cracially aggravated harassment\u201d and crimes \u201caggravated by prejudice\u201d with regard to age, disability, impairment, religion, sexual orientation, transgender identity and sex characteristics \u2013 though Scott describes this law as a \u201cred herring\u201d when it comes to addressing bigotry in football given previous legislation\u00a0didn\u2019t solve the problem. A spokesperson for the Scottish Government told CNN that it is \u201cfully committed to tackling all forms of bigotry and prejudice including sectarianism.\u201d The spokesperson highlighted the new Hate Crime and Public Order Act as a mechanism to tackle hatred and prejudice, and said the government would support the police in \u201ctaking appropriate and proportionate action to safeguard public safety.\u201d Joseph Webster, Professor of the Anthropology of Religion at the University of Cambridge, told CNN that his own research shows that the majority of \u201coffensive chanting\u201d occurs when only one fan group is present, in spaces like a social club or pub, and can \u201cfoster intra-group solidarity.\u201d Webster added that his research shows an unintended consequence of the now defunct Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Act 2012 \u201cis that those fan bases feel unfairly targeted by the police, and the result is they look inward, among themselves even further, and the chanting then escalates.\u201d CNN has reached out to Police Scotland, Scottish Football Association, Rangers and Celtic for comment. Hiding a wider problem Jeanette Findlay, the Chair, and a founding member of Call it Out, a campaign against anti-Irish racism and anti-Catholic bigotry, said that outrage over anti-Catholic chanting in football is \u201ca long running diversion by the Scottish government, Scottish society.\u201d \u201cThe Scottish government and polite Scottish society don\u2019t like to acknowledge that there is, across Scottish society, geographically and in class terms, a continued anti-Catholic bigotry,\u201d she told CNN Sport, explaining that the vast majority of Catholics in Scotland are of Irish descent. The Scottish Government referred CNN to its previous statement when asked about these claims. Findlay says that the government often comments that the problem is contained to football, and by association, areas lived in by the working class. \u201cCatholics are more likely to live in poorer areas, they are over represented in the prison system, hugely overrepresented in religious aggravated hate crime. We are over represented in certain health conditions,\u201d she added. Scottish government data backs up those observations of Findlay. In almost half of religion aggravated hate crimes, \u201cthe perpetrator showed prejudice towards the Catholic community\u201d (47%), according to a Police Scotland report which reviewed recorded crimes in 2020-21. The next largest groups were Muslims and Protestants, who each made up 16% of cases, the report data based on a random sample of cases, found. In 2022-23, police noted that around one in 10 hate crimes were religiously aggravated, though this data set did not disclose which religions were targeted. Findlay said that, while she has heard hostile chants at football matches, \u201cfrankly, I\u2019m more concerned with the employment statistics, and the justice statistics and the health statistics which are more of a problem for us.\u201d \u201cSomeone calling us a Fenian bastard and threatening us on a football pitch doesn\u2019t cause us much trouble. \u201cIf they were marching past places of worship, spitting on our priests and vandalizing our churches, that\u2019s a problem. If they were standing at the door, shouting up, that should be dealt with,\u201d she added. Journalist Spiers said that, although Rangers \u201cmodernized\u201d long ago following pressure from fans and the media, prejudicial songs and their associated meanings \u201cstill hangs around Rangers like a bad stench.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019ve been at Rangers games in recent years where the atmosphere has been great \u2013 nobody is more sensitive than I am to chanting because God knows I\u2019ve written about it for 25 years.\u201d But \u201cevery so often, it will flare up and we all go. \u2018All right. It\u2019s still there. The old problem is still there.\u2019 But it\u2019s not as regular as it was 10, 20, 30, 40 years ago\u201d Spiers added. \u201cPeople find it tedious and boring and tragic. I\u2019m not actually offended by these chants, but I\u2019m embarrassed for my country. I\u2019m embarrassed for Scotland, that people will say \u2013 why are they singing about Catholics, you know, as if it\u2019s as if it\u2019s the 1920s or the 1890s?\u201d Webster is one of many who cautions against relying on legislation alone to deal with bigotry, adding: \u201cI think most people would agree that you can\u2019t prevent someone from holding bigoted attitudes by arresting them.\u201d Celtic recently won the Scottish Premiership, edging Rangers to the title. Saturday\u2019s cup final offers Rangers a chance to stop its rival from winning the double, but given the clubs\u2019 complicated history, how their respective fanbases behave will also be closely watched.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/sport/scotland-soccer-religious-bigotry-intl-spt/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_sport_kevin-campbell-dies-aged-54-spt-intl", "text": "Former Arsenal player Kevin Campbell has died aged 54 after a \u201cshort illness,\u201d the Premier League club announced on Saturday. Campbell played 228 times for Arsenal in the 1980s and 1990s, winning the English First Division title (the predecessor to the Premier League), the FA Cup and the European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup with the North London club.   He later moved to Nottingham Forest and Everton, where he became the club\u2019s first Black captain and a fan favorite, especially for his remarkable record of scoring nine goals in five games to help ensure the Toffees avoided relegation from the Premier League in the 1998/99 season. Tributes have poured in from former teammates, with Wayne Rooney \u2013 who played with Campbell at Everton \u2013 saying he was \u201cdevastated to hear the news.\u201d \u201cKev was a great teammate but more importantly a brilliant person who helped me a lot in my early years,\u201d the former England and Manchester United striker said on X, formerly known as Twitter. He had spells at West Bromwich Albion and Cardiff City before retiring from soccer in 2007 and embarking on a media career as a pundit. Born in London, Campbell grew up supporting Arsenal and joined the club\u2019s academy aged 15 where his knack for goalscoring was quickly established. He later formed a close partnership with fellow forward Ian Wright and the twomen proved integral to Arsenal\u2019s historic 1992/93 season in which it became the first club to win the FA Cup and League Cup double. Wright on Saturday posted several pictures on social media of the two of them. Such was Campbell\u2019s popularity at Arsenal that \u201che remained a dear and cherished friend to many at the club, always maintaining the close links that began in his very early days at Highbury,\u201d the Gunners said in a statement. Similarly at Everton, he became \u201cone of the most popular men to ever wear the royal blue jersey,\u201d the club said in a statement. Meanwhile, former Arsenal captain Tony Adams said on X: \u201cSuper Kev: a goal machine, a giant of a man, with an even bigger heart. \u201cAn intensely private and truly wonderful human being. I\u2019m devastated for his loved ones, and all of us.

He is my idol, the one who I wanted to be when I grew up,\u201d he said on Instagram Stories. \u201cHe was the life and soul of every party and room he blessed, a one-in-a-million person that was loved by everyone.

{"id": "2024_06_09_sport_us-sports-betting-spt-intl", "text": "It has been\u00a0an uncomfortable\u00a0few days for US sports and betting. Earlier this week,\u00a0Ippei Mizuhara, longtime interpreter of Japanese baseball star Shohei Ohtani, pleaded\u00a0guilty\u00a0in court to fraud and tax charges for stealing almost $17 million from the Los Angeles Dodgers slugger to pay off gambling debts. The hearing came on the same day that Major League Baseball (MLB) banned\u00a0San Diego Padres player Tucupita Marcano\u00a0for life after he bet on\u00a0baseball\u00a0games, as well as suspending four other players for a year for betting on games while in the minor leagues. Meanwhile, a Brooklyn man was charged with conspiring with three others to defraud a sports betting company by using inside information from\u00a0a National Basketball Association (NBA)\u00a0player to successfully bet on the performance of that player, who was later banned from the league, according to a\u00a0federal complaint\u00a0filed this week. CNN has determined the player is former\u00a0Toronto Raptors big man Jontay Porter, who was handed a lifetime ban from the NBA after an investigation found that the 24-year-old had violated betting rules. \u201cFans and consumers will put up with a lot when it comes to sports \u2013 just look at how the vast majority of off-field issues not affecting the integrity of the game tend to fade over time,\u201d\u00a0 David Carter, adjunct professor of management and organization at USC Marshall School of Business, told CNN. \u201cBut matters affecting the integrity of the game have a chilling effect across the board and governing bodies know this is their Achilles heel,\u201d he warned. \u2018Proposition betting\u2019 Experts agree that since gambling was\u00a0effectively legalized after a US Supreme Court decision in 2018 \u2013\u00a0it\u2019s now allowed in 38\u00a0states\u00a0and Washington, DC\u00a0\u2013 the industry has boomed with nearly $120 billion put down in legal sports wagers in the\u00a0US\u00a0in 2023, one analysis found. In February, when the Super Bowl was\u00a0held, Americans bet $10.49 billion on sports, a 24.8% year-over-year increase, according to the American Gaming Association\u2019s (AGA) gaming revenue tracker. \u201cYou can bet on any game anywhere, professional or amateur, and not only on the game itself, but you can bet on the individual plays in the game. And you can do it from a smartphone just by pressing some buttons,\u201d says Andrew Zimbalist, professor of economics at Smith College. The popularity of proposition betting, which focuses on individual parts or plays in a game, also opens up numerous possibilities to rig games,\u00a0according to\u00a0Zimbalist. \u201cThere are many, many more ways in which gamblers can approach players and say, \u2018Look, I don\u2019t need your team to lose,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201c\u2019All I need to do is have you not score any points in the first minute of the second half \u2026 then do whatever you want the rest of the game.\u2019\u00a0Well,\u00a0the athlete is going to feel much more protected in that circumstance than they would if they had to blow a whole game,\u201d he explains. What Zimbalist describes exemplifies the concern of some fans as to whether they can trust what they are watching. \u201cOne of the reasons why people love sports is because of the uncertainty of the competition,\u201d adds Zimbalist. \u201cThe moment the idea comes in that this is really being rigged, it\u2019s being fixed, it\u2019s being manipulated, then the interest in the sport will decline.\u201d \u2018Every point matters\u2019 In details that emerged from\u00a0the\u00a0federal complaint concerning the\u00a0alleged\u00a0illegal betting scheme involving Porter, Brooklyn man Long Phi Pham is accused of conspiring with others who bet that the player would underperform. Authorities claim that Pham and others convinced Porter, who had significant gambling debts, to withdraw early from certain games so certain bets on game activities, like how many points he scored, would be successful.\u00a0CNN has sought comment from Pham\u2019s attorney as well as from a representative for Porter. \u201cWhether on the court or in the casino, every point matters. As alleged, the defendant and his co-conspirators, as well as an NBA player, participated in a brazen, illegal betting scheme that had a corrupting influence on two games and numerous bets,\u201d US Attorney Breon Peace said in\u00a0a statement. It was in 2018 that the US Supreme Court struck down a 1992 federal law, which had prohibited most states from allowing sports betting. Fast forward to 2024 and the gambling industry is engrained in US sports culture with leagues, franchises, players and networks now partnering with betting organizations. Victor Matheson, a professor of economics at the College of the Holy Cross, says that sports betting has always happened in the US, but that illicit schemes are now being picked up now that betting is legal and sportsbooks can study their customer base and their habits. Prior to\u00a0legalization, studies \u201csuggested that maybe as many as 1% of all college basketball games were being manipulated\u201d in the US, Matheson said. \u201cSo that would suggest there were a lot of betting problems before these things became legal that we were just missing. And now because it\u2019s legal, we\u2019re catching it,\u201d he adds. However,\u00a0illegal betting has never gone away. According to the Campaign for Fairer Gambling (CFG), some $40.92 billion in illegal gross gaming revenue was generated across America\u2019s total online gambling marketplace last year. What are the leagues doing? In Zimbalist\u2019s view, leagues\u00a0are\u00a0handing\u00a0out punishments \u201cso painful and so costly\u201d that they act as deterrents like lifetime bans. In the case of\u00a0Porter, NBA commissioner Adam Silver said he was receiving the \u201cmost severe punishment\u201d in the form of his lifetime ban in order to protect the \u201cintegrity of NBA competition for our fans, our teams and everyone associated with our sport.\u201d Other leagues with shorter bans are increasing penalties: the NFL last year revised its gambling policy to raise its ban for players who bet on their own team from one to\u00a0at least\u00a0two years. Asked for comment on the issue of betting, a\u00a0spokesperson for MLB directed CNN to a statement made Tuesday by\u00a0league commissioner\u00a0Robert D. Manfred, Jr., who said:\u00a0\u201cWe have been clear that the privilege of playing in baseball comes with a responsibility to refrain from engaging in certain types of behavior that are legal for other people. \u201cSince the Supreme Court decision opened the door to legalized sports betting, we have worked with licensed sports betting operators and other third parties to put ourselves in a better position from an integrity perspective through the transparency that a regulated sports betting system can provide. \u201cMLB will continue to invest heavily in integrity monitoring, educational programming and awareness initiatives with the goal of ensuring strict adherence to this fundamental rule of our game.\u201d CNN has reached out to the NFL and NBA for further comment on how they intend to protect the integrity of their leagues. \u2018Players involved are extremely low profile\u2019 Zimbalist and Matheson note\u00a0that\u00a0it\u2019s unlikely that US sports\u2019 biggest stars would\u00a0become embroiled in betting schemes because they are already paid tens of millions of dollars a year. \u201cThe actual players involved are extremely low profile. These are not LeBron\u00a0James, Patrick Mahomes. These are not the Connor McDavid\u2019s of the world,\u201d Matheson explains. Zimbalist adds that \u201cmediocre\u201d or newer, less established players on a lower salary might be more susceptible to agreeing to rig a game. \u201cThat person is much more likely to feel aggrieved and taken advantage of and hence be more susceptible.\u201d Carter also points out that governing bodies are working with tech companies in order to better catch illicit schemes. \u201cLeagues and governing bodies are doing as much as they can; especially when attempting to balance revenue generation, league policy, and external relations. Sometimes it seems similar to the IRS \u2013 just as one (sports gambling) loophole or workaround is shut down, another arises,\u201d he adds. However, as Zimbalist points out,\u00a0TV broadcasts for sports\u00a0have become so mainstream that fans can\u2019t watch games or read game reports without being bombarded with advertisements from sports books. Problem gambling Meanwhile research suggests\u00a0that individuals in the US with gambling disorders have\u00a0the \u201chighest suicide rate of any addiction disorder.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think we have the resources, the educational systems in place now,\u201d says Zimbalist. \u201cWe need legislation to do things like prevent sports betting advertising, and to prevent prop betting. We need some kinds of constraints, because the problem is much too big to just let the marketplace take over and people become more and more addicted or hooked on gambling.\u201d A 2023 NCAA study surveyed young adults aged 18-22, finding that among those who had seen sports gambling advertisements, 58% said it made them more likely to want to gamble. Among higher risk gamblers, about 80%\u00a0say the ads they have seen make them more likely to gamble. It\u2019s estimated that 2.5 million adults in the US \u201cmeet the criteria for a severe gambling problem in a given year,\u201d according to the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG). However, it\u00a0can be often\u00a0in leagues\u2019 financial interest for betting to increase in popularity.\u00a0For example, the NFL made over $130 million\u00a0last\u00a0year alone in gambling sponsorship deals. That\u2019s more than 5% of the league\u2019s total sponsorship revenue. \u201cThe sports leagues have turned to sports betting because it increases fan avidity. More fans will watch more games when people are betting on it and pay more attention to the news, talk more about the games,\u201d Zimbalist says. \u201cLeagues also make deals with sports books where they sell them data so they can have enough instantaneous data betting play after play \u2013 they take the share of the total amount that\u2019s bet, they charge fees. \u201cThe sports industry looks at these developments, unfortunately, as salutary for their economic health, at least in the short run and generates more revenue. And because then, because the overwhelming drive in these leaks is economic \u2014 owners want to make money and they want the value of franchises to go up,\u201d he adds.

{"id": "2024_05_21_sport_individual-neutral-athlete-olympics-explainer-spt-intl", "text": "Russian athletes have competed under several different guises throughout the 128-year history of the Olympics, and they will be known by another new name at Paris 2024. Following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine \u2013 supported by Belarus \u2013 in February 2022, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes should be prohibited from competing in international sporting events. In January 2023, the IOC announced its intention to allow these athletes to compete as neutrals, in a similar way to how Russian and Belarusian tennis players are presented at ATP, WTA and Grand Slam events without any reference to their nationality. The Russian Olympic Committee was then suspended entirely by the IOC in October 2023 when it absorbed Ukrainian regional sports organizations in Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia. There has been much debate around whether Russian and Belarusian athletes should be permitted to take part in the Olympics, with Ukrainian athletes in particular voicing their concerns. However, the IOC Executive Board ruled that it would be unfair to punish athletes based on their passports alone, thereby allowing some to compete in Paris, albeit under very strict conditions. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes at the 2024 Olympics. \u2018No flag, anthem, colors\u2019 An Individual Neutral Athlete is the name used to refer to athletes with either a Russian or Belarusian passport who will be competing at this year\u2019s Games in July and August. These athletes are referred to by the abbreviation AIN, which comes from the French translation Athl\u00e8tes Individuels Neutres. These athletes will be permitted to compete if they meet eligibility requirements. No reference to either country will be made at the Games through the athletes\u2019 participation. \u201cThe sanctions against those responsible for the war, the Russian and Belarusian states and governments, remain in place for the Olympic Games Paris 2024,\u201d the IOC said in a statement. \u201cNo flag, anthem, colors or any other identifications whatsoever of Russia or Belarus will be displayed at the Olympic Games Paris 2024 in any official venue or any official function,\u201d the statement continues. Competition gear for the AINs has not yet been revealed, so it is unclear whether it will bear the turquoise colors of the brand-new flag of the AINs, or that they will don basic sportswear. An anthem \u2013 without lyrics \u2013 has also been commissioned for use in medal ceremonies. Though AINs are eligible to compete and win Olympic medals, they will not be displayed in the medal table of nations. AINs will also be excluded from the parade of delegations at the Opening Ceremony on the basis that they are individual athletes rather than a team, though the IOC has said \u201can opportunity will be provided for them to experience the event.\u201d Individual Neutral Athlete Eligibility Review Panel In December 2023, the Executive Board of the IOC decided that Russian and Belarusian athletes who qualified through the existing qualification systems of international federations would have to meet strict requirements if they are to be selected as an AIN. There will be no Russian or Belarusian representation in team events, with participation limited to individual competition. Per the IOC, athletes who actively support the war or who are contracted to the Russian or Belarusian military or national security agencies will not be eligible to be entered or to compete. The same stipulation applies to support personnel. Like all other athletes, AINs will need to meet anti-doping requirements to be considered for selection. The eligibility of these athletes will be determined by the newly established Individual Neutral Athlete Eligibility Review Panel. Two-time NBA champion and six-time All-Star Pau Gasol is part of the panel, representing the IOC Ethics Commission. The Spaniard will sit alongside IOC Vice-President and former artistic swimmer Nicole Hoevertsz, and former Olympic table tennis gold medalist Ryu Seung-min, who will be representing the Athletes\u2019 Commission. International sporting federations will need to submit their lists of qualified athletes to panel for review. At the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo (postponed to 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic) and the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, Russian athletes competed under the name of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) \u00a0as a result of the country\u2019s state-sponsored doping program. Athletes could compete under the ROC banner if they could prove that they were not connected to the scandal. However, with the ROC bearing both the name and colors of Russia \u2013 as well as the subsequent suspension of the ROC in October \u2013 it was no longer a viable option for Russian athletes to compete under this name in Paris. It is also important to note that the ROC was not a neutral body, rather a delegation of Russian athletes which technically didn\u2019t compete on the behalf of Russia, but retained a right to represent the country in all but an official capacity. Numbers of AINs at the Paris Olympics The IOC stated that, as of March 28, 12 AINs with a Russian passport and seven AINs with a Belarusian passport have qualified for Paris 2024 but said that the final number of athletes who will actually compete at the Games would not be communicated until the selection process has been finalized. \u201cThe maximum number, which is unlikely to be reached, would be 55 and 28 respectively,\u201d the IOC told CNN. In comparison, Russia sent 330 athletes to Tokyo in 2021 while Belarus sent 104. There is also the matter of whether Moscow will actually accept the conditions laid out by the IOC. Russia is planning to host its own \u201cFriendship Games\u201d later in the year, an event which has been condemned by the IOC. The identity of the athletes is also yet to be revealed, but it is possible that Russian former world No. 1 tennis player Daniil Medvedev will be part of the field. The former US Open champion said that he would be happy to participate as a neutral. \u201cI decided for myself that whenever I can play the Olympics, I want to be there I want to represent what I can represent,\u201d he told reporters last month. \u201cIf it\u2019s not under the flag, I know who I am, I know why I play tennis and I played like this all my life. Russia has competed under a neutral banner on two previous occasions. The ROC was suspended in 2017 as a result of the doping scandal ahead of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea the following year, but selected Russian athletes who met pre-competition conditions were still given the opportunity to compete as \u201cOlympic Athletes from Russia\u201d and were represented by the Olympic flag. Russia and Belarus were also part of the \u201cUnified Team\u201d at the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona after the dissolution of the Soviet Union the previous year. The delegation was made up of former Soviet republics \u2013 aside from the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia \u2013 which had elected to compete as one unit. The Unified Team also bore the Olympic flag but winners were honored under the flags of their own nations.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/sport/individual-neutral-athlete-olympics-explainer-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_sport_charles-barkley-retiring-tnt", "text": "Charles Barkley,\u00a0the\u00a0basketball\u00a0Hall of Famer whose second career as a blunt, no-BS\u00a0commentator on TNT\u2019s \u201cInside the NBA\u201d may have eclipsed the heights he reached as\u00a0a superstar\u00a0player, announced Friday that next year will be his last on TV. \u201cI ain\u2019t going nowhere other than TNT. But I have made the decision that no matter what happens, next year is going to be my last year on television,\u201d Barkley said on NBATV, after the Dallas Mavericks\u2019 Game 4 victory over the Boston Celtics. \u201cAnd I just want to say thank you to my NBA family. You guys have been great to me. My heart is full with joy and gratitude.\u201d Barkley\u2019s exit coincides with Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s (WBD) media rights deal with the NBA expiring after next season. WBD, CNN\u2019s parent company, could renew its deal, but NBC and Amazon have reportedly outbid WBD, according to the\u00a0Wall Street Journal. A new agreement on which networks or platforms might get NBA rights, including a separate package that will likely continue at ESPN, will likely be announced in the coming weeks. \u201cI hope the NBA stays with TNT, but for me personally, I wanted you guys to hear it from me,\u201d Barkley continued. \u201cI wanted to tell my NBATV and TNT family that I\u2019m not going to another network, but I\u2019m going to pass the baton to either Jamal Crawford or Vince Carter or you Steve (Smith).\u201d \u201cBut next year, I\u2019m going to just retire after 25 years, and I just wanted to say thank you. And I wanted y\u2019all to hear it from me first.\u201d Following a Hall of Fame career as a player, Barkley joined as an analyst on TNT\u2019s award-winning studio show \u201cInside the NBA,\u201d in 2000. \u201cCharles is a Hall of Famer and broadcasting icon who is and will always be a beloved member of the TNT Sports family,\u201d said a TNT Sports spokesperson in a statement to CNN.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to another fantastic NBA on TNT season and further discussion of our future plans with him.\u201d Barkley won two Olympic gold medals, made 11 All-Star teams, won the MVP award in 1993 and was named to the NBA\u2019s 50th\u00a0and 75th\u00a0anniversary team. He was among the greatest players never to win a championship, a failure that he said haunted him throughout his career. But his post-career transition to become one of the most beloved and respected sports broadcasters in a generation eventually overshadowed his time on-the-court. It was an unlikely transformation. With a thick Alabama accent and a tendency to shoot from the hip, Barkley is not your typical sports analyst. But his free-wheeling, don\u2019t-care attitude has made him must-watch TV and a viral sensation, even before social media. In his nearly two-and-a-half decades with the network, Barkley has been awarded\u00a0four Sports Emmys\u00a0and has been inducted into the\u00a0Sports Broadcasting\u00a0Hall\u00a0of Fame. Barkley had briefly hinted at a possible switch to politics, expressing an interest in becoming the governor of Alabama. But he has said he was uninspired by the major political forces in the United States. \u201cI consider myself an Independent because I hate the words Republican, Democratic, Conservative and Liberal,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you can be one of those things, but you don\u2019t think that way on every subject. \u201cI really thought hard about running for governor but then I realized, like, I don\u2019t think either one of these parties are really concerned about people and that\u2019s what America is: people.\u201d While the future of the NBA on TNT remains uncertain, WBD announced Tuesday a 10-year deal to become the new US home for the French Open tennis tournament beginning in 2025. Under the \u201cnew expansive deal,\u201d all roughly 900 matches will air live on the streaming platform Max, with featured matches on TNT and TBS and a new whip-around show on truTV. WBD\u00a0already has an existing relationship with Roland Garros since it began broadcasting the tennis tournament across Europe on Eurosport since 1989.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/sport/charles-barkley-retiring-tnt/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_sport_ukraine-euro-2024-sergiy-rebrov-spt-intl", "text": "When Ukraine\u2019s players step out on the field to play Romania in their opening group game of Euro 2024, they will do so with more than just sporting glory at stake. In the harrowing years that have followed Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the besieged nation\u2019s soccer team has become a beacon of hope for a country still suffering under the weight of war. It\u2019s a responsibility that the team takes very seriously and one which it will use as motivation at this year\u2019s European Championship \u2013 the first major tournament Ukraine has qualified for since the war began in 2022. \u201cWe all understand that football is not the most important thing now in Ukraine,\u201d Ukraine head coach Sergiy Rebrov tells CNN Sport. \u201cBut I think our successful performance in Europe gives our people in Ukraine positive emotions. \u201cBefore [the war], when you\u2019re fighting on the pitch, you are thinking only about the result. But I think all of us now are thinking about the result and about showing Europe the real character of our country.\u201d Ukraine finished third in its Euro 2024 qualifying group, behind England and Italy, but beat Bosnia-Herzegovina and then Iceland in a tense playoff campaign to qualify for the major tournament. After securing its place in the competition back in March, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked the team for \u201cproving once again that when it is difficult for Ukrainians, but they do not give up and continue to fight.\u201d Rebrov also said the team received happy messages from soldiers on the frontline, who said how proud they were of the achievement. Ukraine will now have the chance to provide another morale boost for the nation as it tests itself against Europe\u2019s elite, first facing Romania on Monday before playing Belgium and Slovakia in its remaining Group E games. Rebrov, who became a popular figure in Ukrainian soccer as a player, took over as head coach of the national team in 2023 and has overseen the development of an exciting group of players, led by the likes of Chelsea star Mykhailo Mudryk and Arsenal\u2019s Oleksandr Zinchenko. But Rebrov says managing the team during wartime has been challenging. Many of the stadiums in Ukraine \u2013 some of which helped co-host the European Championship 12 years ago \u2013 have been damaged by the fighting. That, combined with the constant threat of Russian violence, means Ukraine can\u2019t play or train in its home country, forced instead to travel around the continent to play its home games. \u201cTraveling to the games is very hard. But, as I said, compared with our fighters, it\u2019s nothing,\u201d adds Rebrov, reflecting a sentiment at the heart of everything the team says and does. Communication, then, is key to helping players and backroom staff who have been impacted directly by the consequences of war. Rebrov says having those conversations is often \u201cvery hard\u201d but that he tries to remind his players what they are fighting for every time they pull on that yellow and blue jersey. To do this, the manager says he sometimes relays messages from those fighting on the frontline during team talks and has even shown his players videos of children who have had their lives impacted by the fighting before games. \u201cThey made some videos for several minutes and, of course, the players were crying,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re watching this video, of course, you come onto the pitch with a different sort of motivation.\u201d Heading into the European Championship, Ukraine has already achieved a major goal by just being there. It\u2019s a powerful symbol that, despite everything, a Ukrainian team is still representing the war-torn country on the global stage. Russia, meanwhile, will not take part given UEFA\u2019s continued ban on its participation. While Rebrov knows that qualification alone has brought some good news to Ukrainians around the world, he still wants his team to do itself proud at the tournament in Germany and has told his players to give their \u201cmaximum.\u201d \u201cWe are there and we deserve to be there. I think now is very important to prepare seriously and to show again the spirit of our nation,\u201d he says, while not setting any specific goals for progression at the Euros. \u201cFootball is different for our players. They are concentrated, but the target is different: not only winning the match. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important during the game to show passion, to show character, like shown by our defenders.\u201d Earlier in June, Ukraine documented its highest monthly number of civilian casualties in almost one year, amid Russia\u2019s sweeping offensive on the northeastern region of Kharkiv. The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) recorded a \u201csignificant increase\u201d \u2013 at least 31% \u2013 in the number of civilians killed in Ukraine in May compared to April, according to a press release. Set to that backdrop, Rebrov knows that sport is not very important, but he\u2019s aware it still has a huge role to play in the war effort. Since the start of the war, Zelensky has called on the nation\u2019s biggest sports stars to fly Ukraine\u2019s flag and the likes of heavyweight boxer Oleksandr Usyk and tennis star Elina Svitolina have continued to draw attention to their country\u2019s needs. This year\u2019s European Championship is yet another opportunity for Ukraine\u2019s soccer team  to do their bit in boosting morale. \u201cEverybody from Ukraine [\u2026] is trying to help each other, trying to help our defenders, trying to help the volunteers,\u201d Rebrov says. \u201cOf course, the most important dream is to finish this war and continue to rebuild our country.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/sport/ukraine-euro-2024-sergiy-rebrov-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_sport_mcilroy-cantlay-us-open-pinehurst-no2-spt-intl", "text": "Rory McIlroy and Patrick Cantlay emerged unscathed as Pinehurst\u2019s notorious No. 2 course sunk its teeth into the first round field at the 124th US Open on Thursday. Brutally firm and fast conditions sent scorecards spiraling in North Carolina yet Northern Ireland\u2019s McIlroy and American Cantlay tamed the beast, each shooting five-under 65 to match the tournament\u2019s lowest ever score at the venue and take an early share of the lead. Seeking to end a 10-year wait for his fifth major crown, world No. 3 McIlroy was a picture of control, avoiding a single bogey before signing off with a superb birdie putt from almost 20 feet. The omens looked good for the 35-year-old. When Germany\u2019s Martin Kaymer opened with the same score in 2014, he repeated the feat the following day before coasting to victory. The last three times McIlroy has made a bogey-free start at a major, he\u2019s gone on to lift the trophy \u2013 including at the 2011 US Open. \u201cCertainly the major championships that I\u2019ve won or the ones that I\u2019ve played well at, I\u2019ve always seemed to get off to a good start, and it\u2019s nice to get off to another one,\u201d McIlroy told reporters. \u201cThe greens are a bit more slopey and there\u2019s a bit more movement on them. But there\u2019s options. You can chip it. You can putt it. I\u2019d love if we played more golf courses like this,\u201d he added. Neck and neck is eight-time PGA Tour winner Cantlay, who poured in six birdies to shoot under 70 for the first time in nine US Open appearances and make the perfect start to his latest pursuit of a long-awaited first major. \u201cI\u2019ve been working really hard on my game, and usually when you make just a couple changes and you\u2019re working really hard, it\u2019s just a matter of time,\u201d world No. 9 Cantlay told reporters. Scheffler sloppy but Aberg soars By contrast, world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler is already chasing his second major \u2013 and sixth win \u2013 in just his ninth start of the season, but the overwhelming tournament favorite left himself with ground to make up after opening with a one-over 71. The reigning Masters champion was uncharacteristically error-prone, hitting just six of 14 fairways. Playing partner and last month\u2019s PGA Championship victor Xander Schauffele went one better with a starting 70, while defending champion Wyndham Clark shot 73. Sweden\u2019s Ludvig Aberg heads the chasing pack at one stroke behind the leading duo, the 24-year-old continuing to cement his reputation as one of the game\u2019s brightest young stars with an opening 66. Aberg hit every fairway and missed just two greens in his first ever US Open round and just his third career major outing, having finished second on his Masters debut in April. \u201cI\u2019m very, very pleased obviously. I wouldn\u2019t want to do it again,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI\u2019m always nervous when I\u2019m playing tournament golf. I think that\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be. I think the day when I\u2019m not nervous, it\u2019s not a good sign. Obviously a lot of butterflies this morning.\u201d Woods left to rue iron play Aberg is one stroke ahead of 2020 champion Bryson DeChambeau and France\u2019s Matthieu Pavon, who became the first player in history to make two eagles in a US Open round at Pinehurst No.2 after navigating the par-five 5th and 10th holes in just six total strokes. \u201cWe know how tough the course can be and even if you go in two for the par-fives, you really have to put the ball in the right spot,\u201d Pavon told reporters after shooting 67. \u201cThis is all I tried, and I succeeded. Dropped some very nice putts today too, so really a good day.\u201d Three-time US Open champion Tiger Woods made a promising start to his 23rd tournament appearance but saw his stellar early putting desert him to drop to four-over 74. Playing under a special exemption after failing to automatically qualify for a major for the first time in his professional career, the 48-year-old was one-under after six holes and was excellent off the tee throughout but was let down by his iron play and lost his early touch on the greens as five bogeys dashed his early momentum. \u201cI think I three-putted two or three times today,\u201d Woods told reporters. \u201cIf I clean that up, if I get a couple iron shots not as loose as I did, I\u2019m right there at even par. \u201cI thought I did the one thing I needed to do today, which is drive the ball well \u2026 I just didn\u2019t capitalize on any of it.\u201d Woods faired relatively well compared to three of his big name counterparts. Norway\u2019s world No. 5 Viktor Hovland slid to an opening 78, while multiple-major-winning American duo Justin Thomas and Phil Mickelson endured similarly nightmarish starts of 77 and 79 respectively. Friday\u2019s second round tees off at 6:45 a.m. EDT (11:45 a.m. BST), with only those among the top-60 and ties at the end of play progressing to the weekend.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/sport/mcilroy-cantlay-us-open-pinehurst-no2-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2023_09_20_sport_saudi-arabia-soccer-spl-bin-salman-intl-spt-cmd-dg", "text": "When Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal reportedly planned a $1.1 billion bid to sign French soccer superstar Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 \u2013 including $332 million to his club, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), and an eye-watering $775 million salary packet to the World Cup winner for just one year \u2013 it was slammed by critics as sportswashing. Mbapp\u00e9 might have said no to the offer in July, but a month later, Neymar Jr. said yes to Al-Hilal, as the Brazil star moved from PSG for a transfer fee of around $98.5 million (\u20ac90 million) plus add-ons, according to multiple reports. In a record-breaking transfer window, Saudi Pro League (SPL) clubs spent close to $1 billion, acquiring 94 overseas players from Europe\u2019s major leagues \u2013 France\u2019s Ligue 1, Spain\u2019s La Liga, Italy\u2019s Serie A, Germany\u2019s Bundesliga and the English Premier League \u2013 according to Deloitte. Despite the Arab nation\u2019s poor human rights record, Saudi Arabia\u2019s spending spree to turn its domestic soccer league into a star-studded, bona fide competition shows the seriousness of its ambition. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman says he doesn\u2019t \u201ccare\u201d about the country\u2019s investment in sport being described as sportswashing. \u201cWell if sportswashing is going to increase my GDP by one percent, then I will continue doing sportswashing,\u201d MBS said in an\u00a0interview\u00a0with Fox News which aired Wednesday. Pressed on if he was bothered by the use of the term, MBS continued: \u201cI don\u2019t care. I have one percent GDP growth from sport, and I am aiming for another one and a half percent. Call it whatever you want, we\u2019re going to get that one and a half percent.\u201d Saudi clubs, several of which have been taken over by the nation\u2019s sovereign Public Investment Fund (PIF), have already attracted some of the biggest names in the sport. By attracting some of the world\u2019s biggest stars to the Gulf states, the SPL wants \u201cto drive competitiveness on and off the pitch,\u201d though it\u2019s keen to emphasize that these overseas players will help develop \u201cyoung Saudi talent.\u201d During this summer transfer window, the government-controlled PIF increased the cumulative value of these four clubs nearly five times, making them the most valuable in the country, according to estimates by the sports website Transfermarkt. Plenty of other leading stars have eagerly said yes to the SPL, notably 2022 Ballon D\u2019Or winner Karim Benzema joining Al-Ittihad at the end of his contract with Spanish soccer giant Real Madrid. As the European transfer window came to a close, the four PIF-owned teams have spent nearly $900 million (\u20ac835.1 million) on buying elite international players, Transfermarkt data shows, which ranked them in the top 20 clubs in the world by transfer expenditure, alongside soccer giants from England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy. Al Hilal alone paid more than $378 million (\u20ac353 million), more than PSG and Arsenal, making it the second-largest spender this year. The newly acquired players join five-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, who has a two-year contract with Al-Nassr where he will earn a staggering estimated $200 million a year, according to Saudi state-owned media, currently making him the world\u2019s highest paid soccer player. As of today, 21 of the most expensive soccer players in Saudi Arabia by transfer fees \u2013 all international stars \u2013 play for one of the PIF-owned clubs. Despite the financial outlay, the SPL is remaining deliberately tight-lipped about the specifics of its financial gamble, with chief operating officer Carlo Nohra confirming to CNN Sport that it was \u201cnot in [the SPL\u2019s] competitive advantage\u201d to report the salaries offered to players and coaches. The PIF has $777 billion in assets under management, according to its most recent filing, with ambitions to top $1 trillion within a few years. In 2021, it acquired English soccer club Newcastle United, before focusing on investments at home. The club is now also among top spenders on players. Saudi clubs not owned by the PIF are also splurging on big-ticket players, with former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson, 33, offered an eye-watering salary of $870,000 (\u00a3700,000) per week, according to multiple reports, in an estimated $15 million (\u00a312 million) transfer from Liverpool to Saudi team Al-Ettifaq. In a recent interview with The Athletic, Henderson said those numbers \u201cjust aren\u2019t true.\u201d \u201cEssentially, the signal is \u2018We mean business,\u2019\u201d Simon Chadwick, a professor of sport and geopolitical economy at SKEMA Business School, told CNN.\u201cWe\u2019ve got so much money that for a player who is \u2026 coming towards the end of his career, we can afford to pay him 700,000 [GB pounds a week], or whatever it is that he\u2019s being paid, and still have Cristiano Ronaldo and still be in the market for other players as well,\u201d Chadwick said, describing Saudi\u2019s approach to becoming a sporting superpower, adding that the sky is the limit in terms of cost. Saudi\u2019s love of soccer Saudi Arabia follows in the footsteps of several other countries \u2013 including China and Qatar in investing large sums of money to try and turn themselves into soccer powerhouses. It remains to be seen whether Saudi\u2019s turbocharged investment will have a lasting impact or resemble something like a costly rebranding effort. The Saudi national team has been to multiple World Cups, and the country\u2019s clubs have won multiple Asian titles. Saudi\u2019s victory over Argentina during last year\u2019s men\u2019s World Cup was hailed as one of the greatest upsets in tournament history, with the country\u2019s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud granting a national public holiday in recognition of the win. Club games can attract huge crowds in the Middle Eastern nation. \u201cFor example, Al-Ittihad against Al-Hilal, you\u2019re talking about drawing crowds of 40, 50, 60,000 people, these are games that are comparable in size to Chelsea vs. Arsenal, Manchester United vs. Manchester City,\u201d Chadwick said. Buying star players, some arguably past their prime, also provides an easy win for Saudi teams, according to Kieran Maguire, co-host of \u201cThe Price of Football\u201d podcast. \u201cFrom the Saudi authorities\u2019 point of view, they\u2019re getting a ready-made product. Everybody\u2019s heard of Benzema. Everybody\u2019s heard of Cristiano Ronaldo and so on,\u201d Maguire said. Saudi Arabia\u2019s lofty sporting ambitions don\u2019t end with the SPL or Newcastle United. The country is hosting the 2023 FIFA Club World Cup and is bidding to host the 2027 AFC Asian Cup. Several media reports also indicated that the Gulf kingdom was considering launching a bid for the 2030 FIFA men\u2019s World Cup alongside Greece and Egypt \u2013 although it is reportedly mulling pulling its candidacy. Meanwhile, the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) has agreed to a contract that will see the Spanish Super Cup played in Saudi Arabia until 2029, a deal that will earn the Spanish governing body between \u20ac35-45 million ($38-48 million) a year. Appealing to the youth Saudi Arabia has a very young population: the country\u2019s most recent census revealed 32.2 million people live in the country, nearly 42% of whom are foreign nationals \u2013 and 51% of the Saudi population are under the age of 30.\u202fOf this populace, Saudi authorities say that over 80% play, attend or follow soccer, the national sport. Chadwick explains that Saudi Arabia\u2019s government is concerned with the prospect of its younger members of society becoming radicalized or an anti-government sentiment bubbling up like that of the Arab Spring \u2013 and looks to offer its population a thriving soccer industry to keep it placated. Though the soccer industry generates employment, revenues, export earnings and inward investment, \u201cwhat is just as significant is the security of the royal family,\u201d Chadwick adds. The Arab Spring, a wave of pro-democracy protests that washed over the Middle East and North Africa in 2011, achieved mixed results. Four Arab dictators in Libya, Yemen, Egypt and Tunisia were toppled, offering a brief sense of victory for protesters, but, since then, new wars have prompted a retreat of popular movements in the region. Meanwhile, failed uprisings in Bahrain and eastern Saudi Arabia were followed by years-long crackdowns and a continuing civil war in Syria. \u201cWhat we\u2019re beginning to see in Saudi Arabia right now is the emergence of a new social contract. And the social contract essentially is catering for the needs of the Gen Z population,\u201d Chadwick said. \u201cYou want Ronaldo? You got him. You want some of the best football teams in the world? You got them. You want the World Cup to come to Saudi Arabia? You got it \u2026 But don\u2019t question us,\u201d Chadwick explained. Maguire agrees, noting that investing in soccer \u201ccan be seen as part of a much broader socio-economic plan, run by the Saudi authorities.\u201d At the same time, there has been \u201ca significant increase in the number of Saudi Arabians detained by the authorities, for example, for posting adverse comments on social media about the country\u201d this year, Chadwick told CNN. Human rights group Amnesty International told CNN that it has documented a rollback in human rights in Saudi Arabia, including an escalating crackdown on freedom of expression and an increased use of counterterrorism and cybercrime laws to silence dissent. Between 2022 and 2023, the organization said it has documented an increase in criminal prosecutions compared to previous years. In 2022, Amnesty reported the highest number of annual executions in the country in 30 years, with 196 people killed. \u201cReputation is important in terms of attracting foreign investment, and \u2026 Mohammed bin Salman, as much as he has significant financial muscle, needs foreign investing for the realization of his diversification,\u201d James Dorsey, the author of the syndicated column and blog, \u201cThe Turbulent World of Middle East Soccer,\u201d explains. Saudi Arabia is the world\u2019s biggest exporter of crude oil, and nearly two-thirds of its income still comes from selling fossil fuels. But with oil prices regularly dipping below what the Gulf state needs to balance its budget, it has focused efforts on trying to bring in investment from abroad along with its efforts to raise oil prices. Projections indicate the kingdom has around 20 years to diversify its economy to ensure it is more resilient, according to Chadwick \u2013 not least to fund its Vision 2030 projects, including the $500 billion Neom city, a 106 mile-long linear city called The Line and a futuristic plan to revamp the capital. \u201cPart of the grand vision of Mohammed bin Salman, looking forward to 2030, he does have his desire to make Saudi Arabia less dependent on natural resources to look at a post-fuel economy [involving] tourism, entertainment. If Saudi Arabia can become a hub for major sporting events, then that\u2019s a way of attracting interest to the country,\u201d said Maguire. CNN has reached out to the Saudi Ministry of Sport for comment on allegations that the kingdom has been rolling back human rights, and investing in soccer as a way of \u201csportswashing\u201d its image. In response to previous criticism about Saudi Arabia\u2019s purported \u201csportswashing,\u201d the kingdom\u2019s sports minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal said: \u201cPeople that don\u2019t know Saudi Arabia, have never been to Saudi Arabia, go out and talk about it as if they\u2019ve lived there for 30 years, 40 years. So I always tell people, come to Saudi. Come and see Saudi. \u201cSee what it is, see the people, meet the people. Look at what the country is doing for the future of the people in Saudi, then you can criticize as much as you like,\u201d he added. Lack of transparency: Saudi threatens new systems of governance\u202fin sports Saudi Arabia has already disrupted the golf industry and, with soccer, Maguire told CNN, \u201cthey feel that they can do that probably on a smaller scale, but perhaps, ultimately, to generate more interest in terms of eyeballs if they go down the same route.\u201d In 2021, the Saudi government-controlled PIF bankrolled LIV Golf, reportedly at a cost of $2 billion, attracting many of the sport\u2019s top players away from the US-based PGA Tour and Europe-based DP World Tour by offering big dollar prize money, with PGA Tour board member Jimmy Dunne raising fears that they might end up \u201cowning golf.\u201d Earlier this year, the US-based PGA Tour announced it was set to partner with the Saudi-backed breakaway LIV Golf, ending a feud that has dogged the men\u2019s professional game for the past year, with Dunne warning that sport\u2019s governing body had no choice but to reach the truce to retain some measure of control. \u201cThey have an unlimited horizon and an unlimited amount of money,\u201d he said at a contentious Senate hearing on the truce between the two tours. When it comes to soccer, Aleksander Ceferin, president of European football\u2019s governing body UEFA, has dismissed the competitive threat that the SPL could pose. \u201cAs far as I know, Mbappe and [Erling] Haaland don\u2019t dream of Saudi Arabia. I don\u2019t believe that the best players at the pinnacle of their careers would go to Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said last month. \u201cWhen people talk to me about the players who went there, nobody knows where they\u2019re playing.\u201d Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp took a different view, referring to the fact that the Saudi summer transfer window stays open after European clubs see theirs close: \u201cI don\u2019t know how stable it is and I think the next two weeks will show how much of a challenge it is because whatever happens there, no one can react anymore. \u201cI don\u2019t know where it will lead to but it feels rather like a threat or a concern than not because I can\u2019t see how we really deny it in these moments, what can we do?\u201d he added. Still, the new SPL director of football, Michael Emenalo, says what Saudi soccer is doing is \u201cno different from what the Premier League have done.\u201d \u201cThere was a time when it was all about Italy. There was a time when it was all about Spain. What we\u2019re looking for in the industry is an opportunity to compete, and to compete on an even scale and to improve upon whatever exists in the industry,\u201d said Emenalo in a press release sent to CNN. New Saudi Pro League Chief Operating Officer Carlo Nohra told CNN that there is logic behind the league\u2019s strategy of money is no object to lure international stars. \u201cWe can\u2019t expect to be paying market value to entice people to come here at this early stage in our development.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0But analysts say that the difference lies in the level of transparency, which \u201csimply doesn\u2019t exist in Saudi Arabia,\u201d Chadwick explained to CNN. European soccer governing body UEFA has financial fair play (FFP) rules on teams\u2019 spending, while Major League Soccer in the US has a salary cap for its clubs. Nohra told CNN that, eventually, the country wants 0.3% of its GDP to be from soccer to make it similar to that of the Premier League on the UK economy \u2013 up from its current value of \u201c0.000 something.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve got no chance to get into that figure at present,\u201d Maguire explained, but added that the SPL could perhaps move into the top 10 of the world\u2019s domestic leagues. \u201cThat is feasible given the amount of money that they\u2019re spending.\u201d \u201cI think they\u2019re realistic. They don\u2019t say that they\u2019re going to overtake La Liga or the Premier League or the major European leagues,\u201d Maguire said. When the Peterson Institute for International Economics compared the world\u2019s sovereign wealth funds on criteria including governance, transparency and accountability in 2019, the PIF scored well below average on a measure combining these criteria, and ranked in the bottom 10 out of 64 funds, just above Russian Direct Investment Fund. CNN has reached out to the PIF for further comment about its investments in sport, particularly soccer and golf, and criticisms about its lack of transparency. Chadwick raised concerns over how a lack of financial rules affecting Saudi clubs might dilute UEFA\u2019s FFP regulations, as well as those of the Premier League, or impact world soccer governing body FIFA\u2019s systems of governance. The lack of transparency in Saudi Arabia\u2019s wealth fund has already raised suspicions in the US golfing and political spheres. Earlier this summer, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations launched an inquiry about the PGA Tour\u2019s agreement with the PIF-controlled LIV Golf. Chadwick told CNN that, so long as there is no independent organization that monitors the reporting of every league\u2019s financial endeavors, \u201cnobody really knows for sure what the accurate financial information is.\u201d \u201cThis vacuum [of information], this uncertainty is wrapped in a veneer of lobbying, which is intended to either overinflate or underinflate player transfer values and salary information because it serves a political purpose,\u201d Chadwick says, adding that this purpose is \u201csignaling.\u201d \u201cIt is almost as though football players are becoming kind of geopolitical pawns in some ways.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/09/20/sport/saudi-arabia-soccer-spl-bin-salman-intl-spt-cmd-dg/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Leading up to the tournament Korda \u2013 chasing a seventh win of the year \u2013 was the overwhelming favorite to win what would have been her second major of 2024, having enjoyed a scintillating start to the season. However, an opening round 10-over 80 followed by a par score of 70 in the second ended any chance of competing further at Lancaster Country Club in Pennsylvania. The American finished two shots adrift of the eight-over cut. Birdies on the sixth, seventh, and eighth holes Friday gave hope that Korda could make the cut after an awful start to the tournament, but a bogey on the par-four ninth gave her too much to do. She ended the day with a bogey on the par-four 18th. Speaking to reporters, Korda said: \u201cI knew it was going to be a tough day \u2026 Try to give it my all, you know that\u2019s what I try to do with every round. I had nothing to lose, and that was my mentality \u2013 just kind of go for it.\u201d Earlier in the week, Thompson had announced she would retire from professional golf at the end of this season. The 29-year-old, competing in her 18th consecutive US Women\u2019s Open, was 13-over overall and afterwards was tearful answering questions from reporters. \u201cMinus the golf it was amazing,\u201d Thompson, who qualified for her first US Women\u2019s Open aged 12, said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the golf that I wanted to play, obviously \u2026 to see all the fans out there, just to hear their chants, made me smile, every single shot even though I kept on bogeying.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s meant the world to me,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m so blessed and grateful for the family that I have \u2026 Going into the week I knew it was going to be a big week. To have my family and friends and the amount of fans that were out there this week, that\u2019s what we want.\u201d Only four players were under par after two rounds, with Thailand\u2019s Wichanee Meechai leading the tournament by two shots at four-under par.

{"id": "2024_06_14_sport_germany-scotland-euro-2024-spt-intl", "text": "Host Germany kicked off Euro 2024 in spectacular fashion on Friday, hammering 10-man Scotland 5-1 in Munich to record the biggest opening match victory in European Championship history. First-half goals from Florian Wirtz, Jamal Musiala and Kai Havertz put the result beyond doubt early on, before Niclas F\u00fcllkrug and Emre Can, who wasn\u2019t even in the squad 48 hours ago, added gloss to the score line in the second period. Antonio R\u00fcdiger\u2019s own goal in the 87th minute was nothing more than a consolation but gave the Scotland fans a moment to remember on a difficult night. The Tartan Army was dealt a double blow at the end of the first half when Ryan Porteous was shown a red card for a horrific lunge on \u0130lkay G\u00fcndo\u011fan, which also resulted in a penalty and Havertz\u2019s goal. The result \u2013 but more importantly, the dominant nature of Germany\u2019s performance \u2013 will likely be a significant boost for Die Mannschaft fans, who largely didn\u2019t have high hopes for their national team at these home Euros. There will certainly be tougher tests ahead, including against Hungary and Switzerland in the group, but Germany couldn\u2019t have wished for a more straightforward \u2013 and encouraging \u2013 start. \u201cI\u2019m happy, I\u2019m satisfied,\u201d manager Julian Nagelsmann told ITV after the game. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy the first game when you\u2019re the home country. \u201cThe first 20 minutes, we did brilliantly, good possession and counter pressing. We conceded one goal, but in the end, it\u2019s okay.\u201d Blistering start It took just 10 minutes for Germany to find a way through Scotland\u2019s defense as Wirtz\u2019s first-time finish from the edge of the area capped a sweeping team move. It was the kind of clinical finish German fans have come to expect from Wirtz after a stunning season for Bundesliga champion Bayer Leverkusen, ending the campaign with 18 goals and 20 assists in all competitions. Just eight minutes later, it was 2-0. This time, it was a piece of magic from G\u00fcndo\u011fan that unlocked Scotland\u2019s backline, turning on a dime before threading a pinpoint through ball into Havertz, who found Musiala for a thumping finish. Things then looked to have gone from bad to worse for Scotland when Germany was awarded a penalty, but the Tartan Army behind the goal was given a reprieve when the video assistant referee (VAR) ruled Ryan Christie\u2019s foul on Musiala was outside of the area. Scotland was offering next to nothing as an attacking threat and the first half was quickly beginning to resemble a training session as Germany passed the ball around with ease. Any semblance of the match being a contest was ended just before half-time when Porteous was shown a straight red card for his wild lunge on G\u00fcndo\u011fan, which also resulted in a Germany penalty that Havertz converted with nonchalance. There were a few stoic renditions of \u2018Flower of Scotland\u2019 that echoed around the Allianz Arena in the second half, but substitute F\u00fcllkrug\u2019s stunning finish into the top corner promptly silenced the Scottish enthusiasm in the stands. But Scotland did come away with a moment to remember just three minutes from time when substitute Scott McKenna headed Andy Robertson\u2019s long free kick towards goal, taking a deflection off R\u00fcdiger and nestling in the back of the net. Germany didn\u2019t allow Scotland fans much time to enjoy their moment as Can, who was a late callup following youngster Aleksandar Pavlovi\u0107\u2019s injury, found the bottom corner from the edge of the area. The thumping win will be a considerable boost to a team that didn\u2019t come into its home tournament with high expectations. Poor form and performances led to the federation sacking head coach Hansi Flick in September 2023 and bringing in Nagelsmann, who has also struggled to consistently find results. Germany has a rich history in major tournaments, winning four World Cups and three European Championships, but success recently has been harder to come by. The national team hasn\u2019t won a knockout match at a major tournament in almost eight years, getting knocked out at the group stages of the two previous World Cups and losing in the round of 16 at Euro 2020. But after Germany\u2019s performance on Friday, some fans might now be dreaming of a second \u2018Sommerm\u00e4rchen\u2019 \u2013 or \u2018summer fairytale\u2019 \u2013 a term given to the summer of 2006 when Germany unexpectedly reached the semifinals of the World Cup on home soil when expectations were similarly low. That year, it was an early Philipp Lahm goal and 4-2 win over Costa Rica that sparked an unlikely summer party.

{"id": "2024_06_03_sport_robert-macintyre-father-caddie-canadian-open-spt-intl", "text": "Most parents would do anything to have a front row seat to their child\u2019s success, yet merely spectating was not quite close enough for Robert MacIntyre\u2019s father. As his son tapped home to clinch his first PGA Tour title at the RBC Canadian Open on Sunday, Dougie MacIntyre \u2013 the head greenskeeper at Glencruitten Golf Club in Oban, Scotland \u2013 simultaneously became a PGA Tour-winning caddie. Having parachuted in his father to work the bag at the last minute, 27-year-old MacIntyre overcame a nervy start and a flock of chasing rivals to win by one stroke at Hamilton Golf and Country Club in Ontario. Just the fifth win by a Scotsman on the PGA Tour since 1940, and the first since Martin Laird in 2020, secured MacIntyre $1.69 million in prize money \u2013 the largest single event total ever claimed by a Scottish golfer and enough to fulfill the new champion\u2019s aims of paying off his parent\u2019s mortgage. Tears flowed freely for father and son as the duo soaked up the weight of the achievement on the 18th green. \u201cI\u2019m crying with joy, but I\u2019m laughing because I didn\u2019t think it was possible,\u201d MacIntyre, a first-time PGA Tour victor on his 45th start, told CBS Sports. \u201cI was going down the last and my dad\u2019s trying to tell me to stay focused and swing smooth because [on Saturday] I got a little bit too fast, but in my head, I wasn\u2019t listening to him \u2013 I was like, \u2018I want to win this for my dad.\u2019 \u201cThis is the guy who has taught me the game of golf and I just can\u2019t believe I have done this with him on the bag. This is just everything for me and family, my girlfriend, my team.\u201d Homesick Two-time European Tour winner MacIntyre had rotated through a string of caddies following triumph on his Ryder Cup debut last October, parting ways with most recent bagsman Scott Carmichael last week after missing the cut at the Charles Schwab Challenge. After the euphoria of victory with Team Europe in Rome, it had been a mixed start to 2024. Though there had been excellent performances, highlighted by a tied-eighth outing at the PGA Championship last month, MacIntyre missed the cut at seven events and had made no secret of his difficulties adapting to his first experience of full-time life on tour in the US. \u201cI was struggling,\u201d MacIntyre told reporters Sunday. \u201cMy girlfriend [and I], we just weren\u2019t enjoying the America Orlando lifestyle that we had thought would better my golf. \u201cIt just clears my mind, being back home. I get to spend time with the boys, a couple of beers with \u2018em, and they just treat me like Bob \u2026 I don\u2019t get treated as Bob MacIntyre the golfer, I get treated as Bob MacIntyre, one of the boys.\u201d A homesick MacIntyre had taken a trip back to Oban in April, picking up the clubs just twice across the three-week visit. After a string of requests for caddies fell through as he called around last Saturday, thoughts again turned to home and a long-time mantra: \u201cIf in doubt, call Dad.\u201d Naturally, MacIntyre senior \u2013 who will return to his greenkeeping duties with immediate effect \u2013 answered. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. I\u2019m a grasscutter not a caddie,\u201d 59-year-old MacIntyre, wiping away tears, added to CBS Sports. \u201cLast Saturday night, I\u2019m sitting on the couch at home and I\u2019m [thinking], \u2018Can I leave my job here? I\u2019m busy at work.\u2019 Eight o\u2019clock the next morning, I\u2019m on a flight out here and wow.\u201d \u2018You might not see Dad till next week!\u2019 After opening with a stellar six-under 64 on Thursday, MacIntyre had said he was trying to keep things simple to help an emergency caddie who \u2013 despite being \u201ca good golfer\u201d \u2013 was \u201cout of his depth\u201d on the bag at the game\u2019s highest level. Yet the unorthodox partnership continued to make short work of Hamilton Country Club, as MacIntyre \u2013 ranked 76th in the world heading into the tournament \u2013 soared into Sunday with a four-shot lead. That healthy cushion had been ripped apart just a few holes into the Scot\u2019s final round though, as Canadian home hero Mackenzie Hughes rattled home three quick birdies to capitalize on MacIntyre\u2019s opening bogey. A first PGA Tour win looked to be slipping away, but MacIntyre \u2013 steadied by his father\u2019s reassurances \u2013 responded brilliantly, fighting back with three swift birdies of his own and shrugging off a back-to-back bogey run after the turn to take a one-shot lead to the final tee. \u201cHe just kept telling me, \u2018We just stay in the fight\u2019 \u2026 He knows what to say and when to say it,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cHe thought that being here was a bit easier on his own mental health \u2026 [rather than] watching the scores on the app, but I don\u2019t think this week\u2019s done him great with the head because of the stress. \u201cBut he\u2019s the guy that\u2019s taught me the game of golf and he knows my game inside out. I can\u2019t thank him enough for this week.\u201d A steady par at the last hole was enough to see MacIntyre over the line ahead of American Ben Griffin at 16-under par overall, with South Korea\u2019s Tom Kim and world No. 3 Rory McIlroy among those within three shots of the victor. It lifts MacIntyre to a career-high world No. 39 position and stamps his ticket to the US Open at Pinehurst in North Carolina on June 13 \u2013 though plans for a first major chase will have to wait until some big-time celebrations have subsided. In a video call with his mother shared by the PGA Tour on X, formerly known as Twitter, MacIntyre warned her of the level of revelry expected to follow. \u201cYou might not see Dad till next week!\u201d he laughed.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/sport/robert-macintyre-father-caddie-canadian-open-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2023_10_30_sport_enhanced-games-olympics-doping-spt-intl", "text": "The 2024 Olympics are fast approaching and as athletes gear up for one of the world\u2019s most prestigious sporting events, one entrepreneur has a different idea of what \u201cfaster, higher, stronger\u201d \u2013 the former motto of the Games \u2013 might represent. The Enhanced Games says it is an \u201calternative\u201d to what it calls the \u201ccorrupt Olympics Games.\u201d Athletes competing at the Enhanced Games will be free to use performance-enhancing drugs, they won\u2019t be tested and will be under no obligation to declare which substances they have taken in order to compete. That\u2019s quite a contrast to the Olympics\u2019 doping protocols. The International Testing Agency (ITA) will be responsible for looking after Paris 2024\u2019s anti-doping program. Six years ago, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which oversees the Olympics, delegated its entire clean sport program to the ITA. However, historically the Olympic Games have been dogged by a series of doping and kickback scandals. When approached for comment on the Enhanced Games and allegations of corruption, the IOC told CNN Sport that \u201cthe idea does not merit any comment.\u201d \u2018Danger to health, to sport\u2019 CNN Sport interviewed a number of experts in the field of doping for this story, who expressed concern that the Enhanced Games was an extremely dangerous proposition. Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, who exposed Russia\u2019s state-sponsored doping program \u2013 a massive, years-long effort which benefited more than 1,000 athletes between 2011 and 2015 \u2013 said that the Enhanced Games is a \u201cdanger to health, to sport.\u201d Whether the Enhanced Games will ever take place remains an open question, but the very idea is drawing considerable blowback from leading anti-doping officials and sporting organizations. The Enhanced Games is the brainchild of businessman Aron D\u2019Souza. He is also the founding editor of \u201cThe Journal Jurisprudence,\u201d a quarterly publication on legal philosophy, according to his website, which also describes him as an \u201cavid athlete.\u201d Recently, D\u2019Souza told CNN Sport he has \u201csigned term sheets with prominent venture capital firms\u201d in relation to the Enhanced Games and is \u201cwaiting on the lawyers to finish long-form drafting.\u201d He also said that a funding announcement is planned for early December. Although not legally binding, term sheets are a serious expression of intent by both sides, setting out the broad principles of an agreement. D\u2019Souza believes what he calls a \u201cscience-driven\u201d competition is the next step in the evolution of sport, suggesting that the absence of drug testing will level the playing field. According to a 2020 study from Raphael Faiss, Research Manager at the centre of Research and Expertise in anti-doping sciences at the University of Lausanne, data from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) suggests less than 2% of athletes dope. However, Faiss told CNN Sport the number of athletes taking performance-enhancing drugs is likely significantly higher; his research, based on two international major athletic events in 2011 and 2013, suggests the figure could be between 15 to 18%. Faiss and his team compared athletes\u2019 blood results collected by WADA-accredited labs to values from healthy adults, as well as doped and undoped athletes; the closer the values are to those of subjects to whom erythropoietin (EPO, which is used in blood doping) had been administered, the higher the chances that they\u2019re actually doping. This analysis, Faiss said, is not proof of doping, but is a \u201crobust way\u201d of analyzing the data, allowing scientists to make an estimate for doping prevalence, as well as targeting athletes most likely to be doping. In written comments to CNN Sport, WADA said: \u201cDetermining the level of [doping] prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed,\u201d explaining that, since 2017, a \u201cprevalence working group\u201d has been established to \u201cdetermine if strategies, reliable methods and tools can be developed to adequately assess the prevalence of doping in sports.\u201d WADA told CNN Sport that the group has delivered \u201cseveral recommendations and guidance to WADA but not the final ones yet.\u201d WADA has reservations about Faiss\u2019 study and pointed to the \u201ccomplexity of trying to measure [doping] prevalence,\u201d highlighting that reports have \u201cgreatly varying results.\u201d The anti-doping organization added: \u201cNo single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline.\u201d \u201cComparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system\u2019s testing figures isn\u2019t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence. \u201cIn any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries \u2013 it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others. \u201cThe Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures.\u201d Editor\u2019s note: You can find WADA\u2019s full statement at the bottom of this article.\u00a0 \u2018A dangerous clown show\u2019 Travis Tygart, the Chief Executive Officer at the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), told CNN Sport that the idea of an Enhanced Games is \u201cfarcical \u2026 likely illegal in many [US] states\u201d and \u201ca dangerous clown show, not real sport.\u201d Substances such as anabolic steroids \u2013 which help to build muscle mass by enabling athletes to train harder and recover quickly from strenuous workouts \u2013 are classified as a Schedule III drug by the US Drug Enforcement Administration. When asked whether anabolic steroids will be allowed at the games and whether athletes would be tested for illegal drugs such as cocaine, D\u2019Souza told CNN Sport that \u201cwe will not be drug testing at the games.\u201d He added: \u201cWe do not propose to regulate what athletes use.\u201d Anabolic steroids may be prescribed by a licensed physician for the treatment of certain conditions such as testosterone deficiency, but if used in the US without a prescription from a licensed physician, a first conviction could result in a one-year prison sentence and a $1,000 fine. But that isn\u2019t the only potential legal jeopardy the Enhanced Games faces, according to American lawyer Jim Walden, who represents Russian whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov. \u201cIf you look at the Enhanced Games website, it\u2019s almost as though they\u2019re advertising their disregard of the law,\u201d Walden told CNN Sport. \u201cThey wrap themselves up in what I will call the cloak of legitimacy by using phrases like body autonomy and coming out as an enhanced athlete. \u201cI hope they\u2019re thinking hard about how they\u2019re going to pull this off in the world in which the FBI has a specific unit that is called the Sports and Gaming Initiative that\u2019s focusing on these very issues.\u201d The Sports and Gaming Initiative was developed to \u201cprotect athletes and sporting institutions in the United States from criminal threats and influences,\u201d according to the government website. The initiative works in partnership with sports leagues and governing bodies, international law enforcement and independent watchdog groups to tackle crimes such as fraud, doping and match-fixing; criminal activities, it says, \u201cdegrade the integrity of sports and competition and erode public confidence in these cherished institutions.\u201d \u201cThe use of doping substances is not acceptable in modern sports,\u201d Rodchenkov said in his written comments to CNN. \u201cPromotion and advertising of banned substances is against sport rules and moral, letter and spirit. \u201cIt might bring an extreme harm to young generation[s] of athletes who mistakenly could believe in benefits of [the] Enhanced Games.\u201d Rodchenkov, the protagonist of the Oscar-winning Netflix documentary Icarus who is currently under FBI protection, also believes that the Enhanced Games\u2019 organizers \u201cmight get investigated [\u2026] under the Rodchenkov Act.\u201d The Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act, named after the whistleblower, allows the US to impose criminal sanctions on individuals involved in doping activities at international events. However, the Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act does not apply to sporting events that don\u2019t adopt the WADA code, which the Enhanced Games wouldn\u2019t do. Rodchenkov also added that WADA athletes could not have any affiliation or contact with so-called enhanced athletes, or they would risk being charged under Article 2.10 \u2013 \u201cProhibited Association by an Athlete or Other Person\u201d \u2013 of the World Anti-Doping Code. USADA\u2019s Tygart also told CNN Sport: \u201cNo one really wants our children growing up idolizing unbridled drug use in sport, even if some profiteers think otherwise.\u201d D\u2019Souza insists his motivation for founding the Enhanced Games isn\u2019t financial. If he had wanted to make more money, he says he\u2019d continue to be a \u201cquiet, mild-mannered venture capitalist.\u201d \u201cI do think fundamentally that consumers want this [the Enhanced Games] and athletes want this because if you go to the cinemas, no one\u2019s interested in histories in the past anymore,\u201d said D\u2019Souza. \u201cThey\u2019re interested in superheroes and technology in the future. And this is literally what we are bringing to a reality.\u201d \u2018The dirtiest Olympics in history\u2019 According to Pierre de Coubertin \u2013 the founder of the modern Olympics \u2013 \u201cfor every man, woman and child, it [sport] offers an opportunity for self-improvement.\u201d Except historically, many athletes competing in the Olympics have taken the idea of self-improvement too far, notably at London 2012, which Rodchenkov has previously called \u201cthe dirtiest Olympics in history.\u201d When the ITA concluded its re-analysis program for the London Games, it found 73 anti-doping rule violations, which led to the withdrawal of 31 medals and reallocation of 46 Olympic medals across the sports of athletics, weightlifting, wrestling and canoeing. Doping has been an issue at the Olympics throughout the event\u2019s history, and the 100-meter final at the 1988 Games has become one of the most infamous and controversial moments in sporting history. Six of the eight finalists \u2013 notably the winner, Ben Johnson \u2013 who lined up on that September day in Seoul 35 years ago would fail drug tests themselves or be implicated in drug use during their careers. Despite some athletes continuing to cheat, global antidoping efforts remain ever-present, according to the testers. Recent out-of-competition (OOC) testing data published by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) highlights positive results from steps being taken to keep \u201celite podiums and finals clean,\u201d according to the anti-doping organization. Data focused on OOC testing ahead of last year\u2019s World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon, shows how resources and testing are targeting those athletes most likely to win medals and make finals. Whilst only 39% of the athletes in Eugene had three or more OOC tests in the 10 months leading up the event, 81% of top-eight finishers had three or more OOC tests. Yet the cat and mouse game between testers and athletes using banned substances continues. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly about the question of timing and targeting the right athletes,\u201d said Faiss. Given that athletes have their blood values regularly monitored, it is \u201cgetting more difficult for athletes to use high doses [of drugs such as EPO], but they would still be using micro dosing.\u201d By taking EPO late at night and drinking enough water, the substance would not be detected in athletes the following morning, according to Faiss, though athletes suspected of blood doping could be tested in the middle of the night. \u201cAthletes are actually getting back to very simple ways of doping with steroids,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cEPO is quite simple to use, but still tricky to detect.\u201d Athletes \u201cuse the drugs that are actively working.\u201d When it comes to new substances such as Roxadustat \u2013 the drug that two-time grand slam champion Simona Halep has recently been given a four-year ban for taking, although she denies ever knowingly or intentionally taking any prohibited substance \u2013 Faiss said athletes \u201care likely to use substances with a very short half-life in [the] body that are mimicking processes of the oxygen carrying improvements through the EPO channels.\u201d Roxadustat has an elimination half-life of 10-16 hours, according to the National Institutes of Health. Athletes are \u201cseeking to find substances where the [half-life] time window is very short, to make sure that if they are not tested at the right moment, they won\u2019t be caught,\u201d said Faiss. \u2018Challenge for sporting competition\u2019 Michele Verroken, the founding director of consultancy group Sporting Integrity, believes an antidoping system is required that will \u201cgive a lot more credibility, a lot more immediacy to verifying results, if we\u2019re going to keep the hearts and minds of athletes.\u201d Verroken also questions what\u2019s stopping an athlete from cheating if they only get caught 10 years after the event, or not at all. Under the World Anti-Doping Code, there is a 10-year statute of limitations on samples taken from 2015 onwards. Verroken told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games is \u201csetting a really interesting challenge for sporting competition.\u201d Not unsurprisingly, many sporting bodies have condemned the event. The Australian Olympic Committee called it \u201cdangerous and irresponsible,\u201d saying that \u201cthe world needs better than this.\u201d UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) said it \u201cis extremely concerned by the concept of an Enhanced Games,\u201d adding that \u201cthere is no place in sport for performance enhancing drugs, nor the Enhanced Games.\u201d UKAD\u2019s Director of Operations, Hamish Coffey, told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games sets a \u201chugely dangerous precedent,\u201d expressing concern over the kind of messaging the event sends to the next generation of athletes. \u2018Very accomplished athletes\u2019 When CNN Sport spoke to D\u2019Souza shortly after the proposed event\u2019s announcement, he said that 368 athletes had enquired about the Enhanced Games and more had messaged via social media. The organization\u2019s Chief Athletes Officer and former Olympian Brett Fraser, who swam for the Cayman Islands at three Olympic Games, told CNN Sport that \u201cvery accomplished athletes\u201d at the level of Olympic finalists have reached out \u201cto understand more about how the first Games will take place and how they can become involved.\u201d Fraser added that Enhanced Games organizers \u201calready have an Olympic medallist\u201d for their athlete commission, though he didn\u2019t specify who that was. He also said there has been \u201ca lot of positive feedback and a lot of acceptance and excitement from younger generations.\u201d Nonetheless, none of the athletes appear prepared to speak publicly at this stage. For those who do want to compete, the Enhanced Games would be an annual event with five categories \u2013 track and field, swimming, weightlifting, gymnastics and martial arts. The huge cost of hosting an Olympic Games is no secret, with countries often striving to create bigger and better spectacles by blowing their budget. Tokyo 2021 had the largest Olympic sports program in history, with 33 sports competitions in 42 venues culminating in 339 medal events. The Covid-impacted Games were delivered with a final expenditure of $13 billion \u2013 almost double the $7.3 billion that was originally forecast. Meanwhile, keeping the IOC\u2019s philosophy of \u201clower-impact Games\u201d in mind, 95% of venues will be pre-existing facilities at the Paris 2024 Olympics. D\u2019Souza said the Enhanced Games will focus on fewer sports, reuse existing infrastructure and fund the event through the private sector to \u201cdeliver a high-impact yet cost-efficient games\u201d so profits can be shared with the athletes. He added that the Enhanced Games is looking for a seven-figure prize pool for any athlete potentially breaking Usain Bolt\u2019s 100-meter world record of 9.58 seconds. \u201cI\u2019ve had conversations with people who are top-10 sprinters in the world who are going to the next Olympics, and they said [\u2026] if there\u2019s a million-dollar prize to break the 100m world record, I\u2019ll be there,\u201d said D\u2019Souza. Universal basic income and mental health support to athletes will also be part of an \u201cenhanced athletes programme.\u201d When asked who would take responsibility if an athlete competing at the Enhanced Games were to suffer fatal consequences, D\u2019Souza told CNN Sport that \u201cour athletes at the games will be the most monitored athletes in history.\u201d He said: \u201cWe will focus on athlete safety by mandating athletes have pre-competition full-system clinical screenings including blood tests and EKGs.\u201d \u201cThis will ensure that athletes are healthy to complete and not at risk of major health complications.\u201d D\u2019Souza also said that athletes will sign waivers in order\u00a0to compete. As it stands, no venues are officially in place to host the event and D\u2019Souza admits its scale will be dependent on funding and media partnerships. \u201cWe\u2019re in commercial negotiations with venues and media partners at the moment,\u201d added D\u2019Souza, who said the first Enhanced Games will be at a university campus or a similar facility in the south of the US and that a number of trademarks have been filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. \u2018Undermine the very purpose of sport\u2019 Elite performance coach Trevor Painter, who has worked with a number of Olympic and international sprinters and middle-distance runners, said he would \u201cnever\u201d coach an athlete taking performance-enhancing drugs because it would go against his morals as a coach. \u201cHaving been involved with many athletes that have lost in many ways to the cheats, I won\u2019t be engaging with [the Enhanced Games],\u201d Painter told CNN Sport. If it goes ahead as planned in December 2024, D\u2019Souza insists that the Enhanced Games will unlock the potential of humanity. But according to John William Devine, Senior Lecturer in Ethics, Sport and Exercise Sciences at Swansea University in Wales, the Enhanced Games will make sporting competition more unfair than it already is and even \u201cundermine the very purpose of the sport in question.\u201d Devine told CNN Sport that \u201cperformance-enhancing drugs don\u2019t actually lead to better athletic performance. They obscure athletic performance.\u201d He added that, although the Enhanced Games may look very similar to the Olympics, the nature of the activity will be different, raising the question: \u201cTo what extent is drug-assisted performance reflective of the athletes\u2019 sporting excellence?\u201d WADA response in full: Determining the level of prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed. That is why we set up a\u00a0Working Group on Doping Prevalence\u00a0in 2017. Measuring doping prevalence is a difficult and complex process. Through its work, the group found a huge variance across the many prevalence studies that have been carried out, leading it to publish guidelines on how to improve the quality of measuring prevalence. WADA is currently developing a tool that Anti-Doping Organizations can use to evaluate the effectiveness of their programs. WADA is well aware of the [Faiss] study. Indeed, one of the contributors, Prof. Martial Saugy, is a member of the Working Group. This study is one of many that helps to inform the Group\u2019s work. It is a very narrow study. It looks at two events, in a single sport, held 10 and 12 years ago, using just one method of measurement (the Athlete Biological Passport (ABP)). As far as I am aware, there is no comparable data from more recent World Championships in the same sport. Given its limited scope, it is important that this study be analyzed within the wider context of other studies and not be taken in isolation. This study also highlights the complexity of trying to measure prevalence. It is the third published paper that sought to measure prevalence at the 2011 Athletics World Championships. Each reported greatly varying results. The fact is no single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline. Results will always come with caveats and margins of error and will be based on a variety of methods, including self-report questionnaires, analytical methods (like ABP and testing data) and other methods to give a more rounded estimate of what the most likely figure would be. Comparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system\u2019s testing figures isn\u2019t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence. In any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries \u2013 it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others. The Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/10/30/sport/enhanced-games-olympics-doping-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "sports"}}

First reported in the Guardian on Tuesday, the chief of police in Gelsenkirchen, the city where England plays Serbia, said they are expecting up to 500 hooligans to try and cause violence. \u201cOfficers from the UK have a good working relationship with the German Police, developed from working together on a number of previous high-profile football tournaments and matches in the past,\u201d the UK\u2019s Football Policing Unit told CNN in a statement. \u201cWe are continuing to work closely with German police to support a safe and trouble-free Euro 2024 tournament for travelling England fans.\u201d Up 40,000 England fans and 8,000 Serbia fans are expected to travel to Gelsenkirchen for a game UEFA, European football\u2019s governing body, and German police have designated as \u201chigh-risk.\u201d In total, some 300,000 England fans are expected to travel to Germany during the tournament. CNN understands the British police have around 2,000 banning orders currently in place for fans. German police told CNN in a statement that they are \u201cpreparing for the possibility of violent hooligans being present in the city area\u201d but added they \u201ccurrently have no information that would confirm this.\u201d \u201cThe upcoming football match between Serbia and England is defined as a high-risk match. Accordingly, we will be deploying more personnel than for less critical matches. The Gelsenkirchen police will be supported by police forces from the entire state of North Rhine-Westphalia. \u201cThe Gelsenkirchen police are in close contact with the English and Serbian authorities as part of their preparations. Communication with the English police in particular is excellent, with a constant exchange of information regarding disruptive events.\u201d The Serbian Football Federation and the Serbian Ministry of Interior did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. At Euro 2016 in France, England\u2019s opening match against Russia in Marseille was marred by violence between both sets of fans, leading to multiple injuries and arrests. An estimated 2.7 million people are expected to visit Germany for Euro 2024, according to Reuters, with large fan zones set up across all major cities. Euro 2024 gets underway on Friday when host Germany faces Scotland. The host It\u2019s fair to say expectations for the German national team are not high within the host country. Poor form and performances led to the federation sacking head coach Hansi Flick in September 2023 and bringing in Julian Nagelsmann. Even now, it continues to be a bumpy ride for the former Bayern Munich coach Nagelsmann; recent impressive wins away to France and at home to the Netherlands were preceded by defeats in Austria and at home to Turkey. But some German fans are now dreaming of a second \u2018Sommerm\u00e4rchen,\u2019 or \u2018summer fairytale,\u2019 a term given to the summer of 2006 when Germany unexpectedly reached the semifinals for the World Cup on home soil when expectations were similarly low. However, a recent poll conducted by national broadcaster ARD found that 27% of Germans had no interest in Euro 2024. Only 43% said they are very interested. Germany has a rich history in major tournaments, winning four World Cups and three European Championships, but success recently has been harder to come by. The national team hasn\u2019t won a knockout match at a major tournament in almost eight years, getting knocked out at the group stages of the two previous World Cups and losing in the round of 16 at Euro 2020. With the weight of expectation lifted, however, perhaps another \u2018Sommerm\u00e4rchen\u2019 is a distinct possibility. The favorites France and England go into the tournament as the two favorites to lift the \u2018Henri Delaunay Cup.\u2019 Les Bleus have been one of the dominant forces in world football in recent years, winning the World Cup in 2018 and reaching the final in 2022. The last time out in the Euros, however, France was stunned on penalties by Switzerland in the round of 16. Didier Deschamps has been in charge of the national team since 2012 and last January extended his contract until 2026. Deschamps, who captained France to glory at the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000, also guided the team to victory in the 2020-21 Nations League and the final of Euro 2016. The current squad boasts an absurd amount of talent, with the experience of Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, Olivier Giroud and Antoine Griezmann supported by the newest crop of stars. Bradley Barcola, Warren Za\u00efre-Emery and Eduardo Camavinga are just some of the gifted youngsters produced by France\u2019s seemingly never-ending conveyor belt of talent. \u201cI want to win the Euros. I have to be honest. I won the World Cup. I won the Nations League. That\u2019s the only one that missed me with the national team after I did everything with the national team,\u201d Mbapp\u00e9 told CNN recently. \u201cI really want to win this. My first competition as captain, so it\u2019s really important for me and it\u2019s always important for the country and we want them to be proud of us. [It\u2019s] another opportunity to write the history of my country.\u201d England\u2019s current national team is similarly awash with talent \u2013 if not more so \u2013 and will rightly feel confident of ending 58 years of heartbreak since it last won a major trophy at the 1966 World Cup. Harry Kane remains one of the world\u2019s best strikers and he will be supported by an all-star cast that features Phil Foden, Bukayo Saka and Declan Rice, while Jude Bellingham\u2019s emergence as one of the world\u2019s best young players adds an extra dimension to England\u2019s midfield. Manager Gareth Southgate has now been in charge for eight years and has enjoyed more success than any of his predecessors since that sole World Cup win. During his tenure, England has reached the World Cup semifinals and  Euro 2020 final but has so far been unable to end the national team\u2019s barren run. Southgate\u2019s contract runs out in December and the English Football Association is reportedly keen to extend it, but the Englishman told CNN last month the decision \u201cwill be mine.\u201d \u201cOf course, we got so close in the last Euros,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cWe were one penalty away, one goal not conceded away from being European champions anyway. So, the players know how close we are. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve been that close \u2026 in the end, you need to take that final step.\u201d The dark horses Hungary has been tipped by many as the dark horse of the tournament after qualifying for its third consecutive European Championship. Led by Liverpool midfielder Dominik Szoboszlai, who will become the youngest captain in Euros history in Germany, this impressive Hungary side went through qualifying unbeaten and conceded just seven goals in eight matches. The team also came second in its Nations League group that also featured Italy, Germany and England, conceding just five goals in six games. Defence, clearly, will be the key to any Hungarian success at Euro 2024. \u201cI don\u2019t have expectations of anyone or the team,\u201d Szoboszlai told UEFA. \u201cWe know exactly what we are capable of; we know what we have achieved so far against other national teams. \u201cI don\u2019t want to burden the team, and I don\u2019t want the outside world to burden us. But if we feel pressure, we can help each other enjoy the EURO. \u201cIt\u2019s not a small thing to be there. However, we do have a very good team. It\u2019s like a big family, and together we can do anything.\u201d Ukraine, appearing in the country\u2019s fourth straight Euros, also has the chance to make waves in Germany after a solid qualifying campaign. The team narrowly missed out on automatic qualification after losing out on head-to-head with Italy, but battled through tough playoff games against Bosnia and Herzegovina and Iceland, winning both matches 2-1 to reach the finals. Each victory is especially significant against the backdrop of Russia\u2019s ongoing war in Ukraine; this is the first major tournament Ukraine has qualified for since the invasion began. With players such as Oleksandr Zinchenko, Andriy Lunin and Mykhailo Mudryk playing for some of Europe\u2019s biggest clubs, plus the emergence of Artem Dovbyk as the most prolific striker in Spain, Ukraine should feel confident of at least progressing from a forgiving group that features Belgium, Slovakia and Romania.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/sport/euro-2024-england-serbia-hooligan-fears-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_sport_carlos-alcaraz-french-open-tennis-spt-intl", "text": "As a child, Carlos Alcaraz used to run home from school to watch the French Open on TV, dreaming of one day playing on the tournament\u2019s clay courts and becoming champion. That dream became a reality on Sunday as the Spaniard defeated world No. 4 Alexander Zverev in five sets to lift his third grand slam title \u2013 all at the age of only 21. In a gritty and often unpredictable performance on Court Philippe-Chatrier, Alcaraz showed his trademark fight and resilience against Zverev, coming back from two sets to one down to become the youngest man to win major titles on clay, grass and hard courts. \u201cHonestly, first of all, I\u2019m exhausted,\u201d Alcaraz told CNN Sport\u2019s Amanda Davies the day after claiming his first title at Roland Garros. \u201cIt was a really tough one. It is a dream come true for me. I really wanted to lift this trophy one day, and then to be able to do it is a great feeling. \u201cThis tournament, I\u2019ve watched it since I was five, six years old \u2026 Being in this position right now is so, so special,\u201d he added. With Alcaraz\u2019s latest success comes yet another tattoo. He already has the dates of his grand slam wins at the US Open and Wimbledon \u2013 the latter alongside a strawberry synonymous with the tournament \u2013 inked on his skin, and now plans to get the Eiffel Tower and Sunday\u2019s date on his left ankle. It seems a fitting choice: after his victory in the City of Light, Alcaraz shared an old photo of himself aged 12, watching the tournament on a big screen in the shadow of the Paris landmark. Is he worried about running out of skin space, should he continue to accumulate more grand slam titles? \u201cThis is good news if that happens,\u201d said Alcaraz. \u201cI said to my family and to my team that it\u2019s going to be the first grand slam. If I win another French Open, I\u2019m not going to get a tattoo.\u201d With his victory over Zverev, the world No. 2 joins a long line of Spanish men to have lifted the French Open title. Rafael Nadal leads the way with a record-breaking 14 titles, while Juan Carlos Ferrero, Albert Costa, Carlos Moy\u00e1 and Sergi Bruguera have all been champions since 1993. \u201cI really wanted to put my name on that list as well,\u201d said Alcaraz, who is now coached by 2003 winner Ferrero. Having sustained an arm injury ahead of this year\u2019s French Open, the Murcia native withdrew from the Italian Open but has exceeded his expectations physically over the past two weeks, winning four of his seven matches in three sets. It was only against Zverev and new world No. 1 Jannik Sinner that Alcaraz went the distance \u2013 the first man in the Open Era to win the final and the semifinal of the French Open in five sets. After losing the third set against Zverev, letting slip a 5-2 lead, he had to dig deep into his energy reserves and raise his intensity, racing around the court and chasing down every shot. The two highlights were a so-called \u201cbanana\u201d forehand \u2013 made famous by Nadal \u2013 in the fourth set and a stunning backhand passing shot when Alcaraz had seemed certain to lose the point in the deciding set. \u201cIf I lost, I wanted to do it fighting until the last ball, running, playing my best tennis,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I thought about in that moment: to keep trying to find solutions.\u201d Alcaraz\u2019s attention now turns to Wimbledon, where he will defend the title he won in dramatic fashion against Novak Djokovic last year, and then the Olympics in Paris, which will mean a return to Roland Garros. There, he hopes to play doubles alongside Nadal \u2013 potentially one of the 22-time grand slam champion\u2019s final tournaments \u2013 as well as going for a gold medal in the singles competition. \u201cI\u2019ve won Roland Garros and I\u2019m going for the Olympics,\u201d said Alcaraz. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to get both.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/sport/carlos-alcaraz-french-open-tennis-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_sport_chris-birch-nasa-astronaut-cycling-spt-scn-intl", "text": "Scroll through the athlete profiles on the USA Cycling website and you\u2019ll find someone whose favorite movie is listed as \u201cInterstellar\u201d \u2013 Christopher Nolan\u2019s acclaimed sci-fi adventure released in 2014. \u201cI love realistic space movies \u2026 I\u2019m definitely a nerd,\u201d reads Chris Birch\u2019s answer on her profile page. That response proved prescient: shortly after stepping away from her professional cycling career, the Arizona native was selected from more than 12,000 applicants to join NASA\u2019s astronaut class of 2021. As career sidesteps go, it was an unusual one, though Birch had an extensive background in science with degrees in mathematics, biochemistry and molecular biophysics, and a doctorate in biological engineering. The further she progressed with her application to join NASA, the more convinced she became that she had a future in spaceflight. Interviews with panels of current and former astronauts, she thought, were stimulating, not intimidating, and so too were the selection exercises undertaken with other candidates. \u201cI really just had a blast,\u201d Birch tells CNN Sport. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like an interview at all, it didn\u2019t feel like a test. It was just super fun. And it felt like fun and games for me.\u201d It\u2019s now been close to two and a half years since Birch joined NASA, and in that time, she has practiced for space walks, learned to fly T-38 training jets and developed skills needed to operate the robotic arm on the International Space Station. Her training also involved acquiring expeditionary skills, understanding how to operate the complex systems on the space station, and even becoming proficient in Russian, the language needed to fly the Soyuz spacecraft. When she graduated at Houston\u2019s Johnson Space Center in March, the 37-year-old had few qualms about the unexpected U-turn her career had taken, her appetite for spaceflight keener than ever before. \u201cI absolutely would love to explore off this planet,\u201d says Birch. \u201cI think there\u2019s a pretty good shot that I\u2019ll get to go do science aboard the International Space Station, maybe even get to do some wrenching outside and work on making some upgrades. \u201cIt would be an absolute career highlight to be able to go back to the moon as part of one of the Artemis missions and do science on the moon.\u201d Birch left academia in 2018 to pursue a career in professional cycling, going on to win 11 national titles and represent the US at the world championships on several occasions. It was around the time that she was training to make the team for the postponed Tokyo Olympics that Birch applied to join NASA, and when she missed out on selection for the Games, she decided to throw herself wholly into her new pursuit. Despite the evident differences in cycling and spaceflight, she believes that the same sense of curiosity and wonder has motivated her in both disciplines. \u201cI think there\u2019s something really powerful about being surrounded by a group of people that are all trying deliberately to not walk the path most trodden,\u201d says Birch. \u201cWe\u2019re all looking to push the envelope in some way, and that has always been my driving mantra. The whole reason I pursued a PhD is I wanted to discover something, to build something that had never been done before. \u201cMy fascination with sport was all about seeing how fast we could go. Can we push the human body \u2013 my body, my mind \u2013 farther than I thought I could go? It really was a natural extension of that inner drive for me, if not a slight change in the technical topics.\u201d Joining NASA has meant that Birch\u2019s days of flying around a velodrome at lightning-bolt speeds are over, but her desire to test her physical limits remains. She has turned her focus towards endurance challenges, completing the iconic Leadville Trail 100 mountain bike race \u2013 a 100-mile course with 12,000 feet of elevation gain in Colorado \u2013 last year, as well as racing the Houston Marathon in January. On her radar is an attempt to break the women\u2019s time record for cycling north to south across Montana, some 400 miles on gravel roads. Challenges like that are not so far removed from astronaut training, which involves group expeditions in the field, living in the wilderness for days at a time and learning how to handle stress in a critical, unforgiving environment. \u201cCycling in particular \u2013 it just supports so much suffering,\u201d says Birch. \u201cIt\u2019s a really great avenue to practice mental toughness. It doesn\u2019t cost much, versus for me to go out and fly in a multi-engine jet aircraft is thousands of dollars an hour. \u201cThis is something that I can go do and practice that toughness training, especially if I\u2019m descending on a mountain bike trail, six hours in and I\u2019m really tired \u2013 I\u2019m now making critical handling decisions in response to my environment. \u201cI feel like that translates really well to being able to do that in the jet \u2013 it\u2019s the same mental clarity, mental focus you have to maintain. I think it\u2019s an awesome space to practice that.\u201d Birch is now firmly focused on her first projects since graduating. Recently, that\u2019s involved supporting Artemis II recovery training in the Pacific Ocean, off the coast from California. The Artemis II mission, now scheduled for September 2025 after a delay of several months, aims to send four astronauts on a journey to fly by the moon, and being able to prepare for the safe recovery of the astronauts and the capsule, Birch says, gave an \u201cincredible appreciation for the needs of the crew,\u201d even while she\u2019s still a rookie. There\u2019s no obvious timeline or pathway for when or how she might be able to venture away from planet Earth herself, but it remains a firm ambition in her life and career. \u201cI\u2019m going to prepare for that the same way I would prepare for a race,\u201d says Birch, \u201cshow up every day and give 100% to the team. If the timing works out, then that\u2019s great. But I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/sport/chris-birch-nasa-astronaut-cycling-spt-scn-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_09_sport_french-open-final-mens-final-2024-spt-intl", "text": "Carlos Alcaraz won his third grand slam title and first at the French Open on Sunday, defeating Alexander Zverev 6-3 2-6 5-7 6-1 6-2 in an engrossing contest. With the victory, the 21-year-old Alcaraz becomes the youngest man to claim a grand slam title on every surface having won the US Open in 2022 and Wimbledon last year. He came through a tense match against Zverev on Court Philippe-Chatrier to add to his collection of trophies, rallying from two sets to one down in impressive fashion. In windy conditions, the Spaniard showcased his fearless brand of tennis in front of a lively Parisian crowd. Having saved multiple break points to maintain the lead in the deciding set, he went a double break ahead before serving out for the victory in four hours and 19 minutes, sinking to the floor and punching his fists in delight. Alcaraz remains unbeaten in grand slam finals and is the youngest man to triumph at the French Open since compatriot Rafael Nadal won the third of his 14 singles titles in 2007. \u201cThe crowd has been great (for me) from the first match until today,\u201d Alcaraz said in his on-court interview, having thanked his team and family. \u201cI just have good words for you guys for the support I\u2019ve received, not only in matches but in practices \u2026 You\u2019ve made this tournament so special.\u201d After Iga Swiatek won the women\u2019s singles title in straight sets on Saturday, this was a much tighter affair as momentum swung to and from each player throughout. The pair exchanged breaks in a nervy start to the match before Alcaraz gained the upper hand with a break at 2-2. He proceeded to wrap up the set with a thumping forehand winner, but from there Zverev upped his intensity and produced much better tennis in the second set. The German, aiming to win his first grand slam title having lost to Dominic Thiem in five sets in the 2020 US Open final, had an 83% first-serve success rate in the second set as he leveled the match having gone a double break ahead. It looked as though Alcaraz had regained control of the match in the third set when he saved three break points to move into a 5-2 lead. Suddenly, however, his play dipped and Zverev came roaring back, winning the next five games to lead for the first time in the match. The world No. 3 needed to respond and did so in style. An outrageous whipped forehand handed Alcaraz a 2-0 lead in the fourth set before a well-executed drop shot engineered another break of Zverev\u2019s serve two games later. An exchange of breaks followed either side of a medical timeout for Alcaraz, who then held his serve to force a decider. This was just the second time since 2005 that the men\u2019s French Open final had gone to five sets, and a string of unforced errors from Zverev \u2013 including a double fault \u2013 was a sign that the pressure was starting to take its toll. Having moved up a break, Alcaraz then had to dig himself out of a 0-40 hole the following game to maintain the advantage. The finish line in sight, a stunning backhand passing shot helped him on the way to another break, and from there winning a third grand slam title \u2013 on hard courts, grass, and now clay \u2013 was only a formality. Zverev had his best-ever run at the French Open against the backdrop of an assault case, which, on Friday, a Berlin court announced that he and his former partner had agreed to settle with no admission of guilt from Zverev. Asked about the settlement prior to the final, the World No. 4 said that he was \u201chappy that it\u2019s over\u201d but didn\u2019t \u201cever want to hear another question about the subject again.\u201d He had to come through two five set matches \u2013 against Tallon Griekspoor and Holger Rune \u2013 in his run to the final, as well as recovering from a set down against Casper Ruud in the semifinals. Alcaraz, by contrast, had spent less time on court than his opponent, despite carrying an arm injury prior to this year\u2019s French Open. He improves his record in five-set matches to 11 wins and only one loss \u2013 a remarkable statistic for such a young player. One of those marathon wins was against Australian Open champion and soon-to-be world No. 1 Jannik Sinner in the semifinal, making Alcaraz the first man in the Open Era to win the final and the semifinal of the French Open in five sets. He may not have been at his best throughout the final against Zverev \u2013 hitting 56 unforced errors alongside 52 winners \u2013 but his latest grand slam triumph was further evidence that Alcaraz thrives when playing under enormous pressure in high-stakes matches. This was another milestone performance in what looks likely to be a remarkable tennis career.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/sport/french-open-final-mens-final-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2022_07_25_sport_black-representation-swimming-equality-spt-intl", "text": "Omie Dale has fond memories of splashing in the sea as a child, of racing through water parks and swimming in backwaters and rivers.   \u201cThere\u2019s so much joy that can be had once you learn to swim, once you\u2019ve abandoned those fears and you can get in the water,\u201d the 25-year-old Dale, who is based in southeast London, tells CNN Sport.  Even though swimming is a joyful experience for Dale, the stark reality is that many Black communities in Britain and the US do not have safe access to swimming lessons and public pools due to historic racism and segregation \u2013 a problem that is especially alarming given that, as Dale says, it is \u201cthe only sport that can save your life.\u201d  A history of exclusion The lack of access afforded to Black communities in Britain is what motivated Dale to become a swimming teacher in September 2019.  \u201cI used to work in Kensington (in London) as a lifeguard and some of the richest people live in that borough, but also some of the poorest,\u201d she says. She saw there was a difference when private schools and independent schools would come in and all the kids were able to swim, yet hardly any children of the same age that Dale saw from state schools could swim 25 meters.  \u201cThere\u2019s a real class barrier in the sport of swimming,\u201d Dale adds.   She is a director of Swimunity, a collective offering free swimming lessons to women and children in North Kensington, West London. It was born in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster in 2017, when a residential block caught on fire, killing 72 people \u2013 and leaving many more without homes.   \u201cThere\u2019s like a lot of people who come to swim lessons \u2026 who have undergone some form of trauma, whether that be water-related trauma or trauma related to their everyday lives,\u201d Dale says.   \u201cMany people say it\u2019s like an escape from their daily lives or is, actually, the first time that they\u2019ve taken time for themselves.\u201d  While 77% of children from the most affluent families in England can swim 25 meters unaided, only 34% from the least affluent families can, according to a 2021 survey from Sport England, a non-departmental public body that fosters grassroots sports in England.  About 95% of Black adults and 80% of Black children in England do not regularly participate in swimming, according to Sport England\u2019s report, published in January 2020. Likewise, about 93% of Asian adults and 78% of Asian children, including those with Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi heritage, do not regularly participate in swimming, the same research found. This trend extends to the US, where nearly 64% of Black children have \u201clow\u201d or no ability to swim, compared with 40% of their White peers, according to 2017 data from the country\u2019s national governing body for the sport at a competitive level, USA Swimming.   The underrepresentation of Black people in the pool in the US can be traced back to the early 20th century.   Public swimming pools became popular in North America in the 1920s and 30s and were initially open to all. However, Northern politicians stipulated a \u201cWhites Only\u201d rule, referencing racist fears about Black men fraternizing with White women.   Even after legal racial segregation ended in the US in 1964, public pools continued to be hostile environments. As people of color began to use public pools, White swimmers retreated to the privacy of their own pools and private clubs, where expensive fees continue to be an economic barrier for Black families who cannot afford the cost.    Similar examples in Britain illustrate how racial and class inequalities lead to the systemic exclusion of Black people in pools. For example, more than 4.2 million people in the UK live in ethnically diverse communities where Covid-19 national lockdowns resulted in the closure or mothballing of pools, according to Swim England \u2013 England\u2019s national swimming governing body \u2013 and the Black Swimming Association (BSA), a UK-based charity that aims to encourage more African, Caribbean and Asian communities to take up swimming.  \u2018We cannot keep recovering bodies\u2019  Globally, drowning is the third leading cause of accidental injury-related death and at least 236,000 people die each year from drowning, according to 2019 data from the World Health Organization (WHO). Children are particularly affected, with drowning being one of the top five causes of death for those aged 1-14 years in 48 of 85 countries studied by the WHO.   And while natural disasters and irregular migration are notorious risk factors, so are lower socioeconomic status, lack of higher education and being a member of an ethnic minority, depending on the country, WHO research shows.  \u201cMost drowning incidents happen when people never intend to get into the water in the first place,\u201d says Dale, who was awarded Swim Teacher of the Year by Swim England in 2021.  In December 2019, three members of the same Black British family \u2013 a 53-year-old father and his two children \u2013 died in a swimming pool at a resort in Costa del Sol, Spain, Reuters reported. The father and his 16-year-old son had reportedly leapt into the water to try to save his nine-year-old daughter, who was drowning.   Danielle Obe is the co-founder and chair of the BSA. She told CNN Sport that the Costa del Sol deaths prompted her to establish the BSA in March 2020, alongside Olympic swimmer Alice Dearing, journalist Seren Jones and songwriter, rapper and producer Ed Accura.    \u201cThis was devastating because these families were actually acquainted to me and they were from my local community,\u201d Obe says. \u201c(At) that point, I called Alice and Seren, and I said, \u2018We\u2019ve been talking about doing something for our community. We\u2019ve got to do something. We\u2019ve got to do it now. We cannot keep recovering bodies.\u2019\u201d   \u201cIt\u2019s no longer just about that lack of representation,\u201d Obe adds.   \u201cIt\u2019s now about saving lives, vital water safety, education for all. Swimming is an intervention. Swimming is a life skill.\u201d  However, there is still a lack of data when it comes to drowning-related deaths by ethnicity in the UK, says Obe.  \u201cAt the moment, we don\u2019t know how much of a disparity there is between drowning and fatalities, aquatic fatalities for different communities in the UK because, up until now, drowning data isn\u2019t really captured by ethnicity, which is another point, another issue that the BSA is looking to tackle.\u201d \u2018People just don\u2019t think Black people should swim\u2019  Dearing, the first Black female swimmer to represent Britain at the Olympics when she competed at Tokyo 2020, \u201cimplores\u201d people to learn to swim.   \u201cI have been quite torn between the amazing achievement of being the first Black woman to represent GB in swimming but wanting to be my own person, my own athlete, who\u2019s known for being an athlete and not for her race and her sport combined together,\u201d she tells CNN Sport. \u201cI take the two of them just as they are \u2013 kind of like separate things. I\u2019m trying to be the best athlete and best role model that I can be to show people that they can do the sport, that the sport is for everybody.\u201d At the age of 24, Dearing was making history in Japan and became a beacon of hope for young people \u2013 especially Black girls \u2013 who wanted to break into the sport.   But her personal triumph also drew attention to the institutional access gap for people of color in swimming.    \u201cFortunately, for myself, I haven\u2019t come across any barriers at the level I\u2019m at currently,\u201d Dearing says.   \u201cBut I have faced barriers when I was younger and issues where people just don\u2019t think Black people should swim, or do swim, or think that we\u2019re better suited to other sports and so shouldn\u2019t even learn to swim or attempt swimming in the first place.\u201d  CNN reached out to the International Swimming Federation (FINA), Sport England and USA Swimming requesting a breakdown of Black and ethnic minority participation in swimming at grassroots and professional levels of the sport. However, they told CNN they were unable to provide such data.  FINA \u2013 the global governing body for swimming \u2013 told CNN it does not have a breakdown of the ethnicities of swimmers at a grassroots or elite level.   FINA said in 2021 it allocated $6.6 million towards development programs for distribution among all national federations and continental associations, while also pushing for diversity in the sport through its \u201cSwimming for All, Swimming for Life\u201d program.   \u201cFINA remains fully committed to non-discrimination,\u201d the organization said to CNN in a statement. \u201cFINA continues to work hard to ensure that the global aquatics community is a place where all athletes, coaches and administrators are treated equally. \u201cWork will continue to develop and grow with the support of members of the aquatics community as we strive to be at the forefront of this essential area,\u201d FINA added.    Sport England told CNN in a statement that it is \u201ccommitted to increasing investment in facilities and organisations across England to try to level up access to good quality sports and activities.\u201d \u201cBarriers to getting active persist and have even been exacerbated for some disadvantaged groups \u2013 like women, people with long-term health conditions, disabled people, people from ethnically diverse communities and lower socio-economic groups,\u201d the statement added.   Sport England said in May it announced further funding that brings its total investment in its 121 partners to more than \u00a3550 million ($670 million), which they\u2019ve selected \u201cdue to their unique position to tackle entrenched activity inequalities and influence positive change throughout the sector, their own networks and beyond.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s not all about the economic side of things. It is also about getting people to feel comfortable with putting their kids in swim lessons and in competitive swimming so that they can then go and do other aquatic-based sports,\u201d Joel Shinofield, the managing director of sport development at USA Swimming, told CNN during a phone call.  USA Swimming is a membership-serviced organization that has over 3,100 clubs and more than 400,000 members, according to the official website.   \u201cOur goal is to facilitate opportunities and make sure they\u2019re good ones. While our clubs are the ones that do that on the local level, the resources, guidance, support, financial investment that we provide can shift who those opportunities can be provided to and more broadly create access,\u201d he added.   Shinofield said that USA Swimming has established a 10-year initiative that will grant $1 million to develop learn-to-swim and competitive opportunities for communities served by Historical Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The program was announced in 2021, according to the USA Swimming official website.   Serving underrepresented communities  From representing their organization at the UK\u2019s first Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Summit For Sport in Birmingham, England earlier this year to facilitating swimming classes in Hackney \u2013 one of the most deprived boroughs in London \u2013 Obe hopes that the BSA will help bridge the barrier through community-level engagement.   \u201cThat community engagement really is to build trust, accountability and collaboration with disenfranchised communities and the sector,\u201d says Obe.  \u201cOnly in understanding these attitudes and understanding some of the barriers that preclude our communities from engaging in aquatics can we begin to drive change.\u201d  In August 2021, the BSA announced it would conduct a research program with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the University of Portsmouth, exploring the behaviors and barriers that prevent African, Caribbean and Asian communities from swimming.    Speaking about the program, Obe says: \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to inspire confidence with African, Caribbean and Asian communities, and the only way we\u2019re able to do that is to ensure that we understand where these communities are in the first place and understand why they don\u2019t engage in aquatics, why we don\u2019t see the representation pool side and why we don\u2019t even see the representation within some aquatic organizations.\u201d  Dale also volunteers with Mental Health Swims, a grassroots organization that facilitates swimming meet-ups for people struggling with their mental health. As part of her work for the organization, she coordinates swim events in south London to help swimmers access the mental health benefits of the sport. She also volunteers for Pride in Water, a network that aims to increase LGBTQ+ representation in swimming.   \u2018The future is bright\u2019  Dearing says that despite the racial and economic barriers to swimming for African, Caribbean and Asian communities, she\u2019s still optimistic about the changing landscape of the sport.  \u201cI really think if anything is going to change, it\u2019s going to be now, it\u2019s going to be over the next couple of years,\u201d she says. \u201cEach story is different, each person is different and has to be understood in their own way, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, that\u2019s just another challenge that we have to face and we\u2019re up for it.  \u201cIt\u2019s tough \u2013 it\u2019s not a quick fix, but the future is bright.  \u201cI like to feel that I\u2019m giving something back to swimming and, hopefully, giving something to the Black community to hopefully achieve, strive for and change the way that Black people are viewed in swimming and the way Black people view swimming.  \u201cIt\u2019s a double-edged sword; I absolutely love doing it. Sometimes, it\u2019s really frightening and daunting, but if I\u2019m trying to make the world a better place, then sometimes you got to step out and scare yourself.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/07/25/sport/black-representation-swimming-equality-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_sport_sports-betting-gambling-professional-athletes-dg", "text": "As the sports betting industry continues to rake in record-breaking revenue, a growing number of professional athletes have become entangled in gambling scandals and gambling addiction helplines are reporting a rise in calls and text messages from people asking for help. Earlier this month, Major League Baseball (MLB) banned San Diego Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano for betting on games. The National Basketball Association (NBA) banned Toronto Raptors player Jontay Porter ahead of the 2024 playoffs for violating betting rules. MLB also issued one-year suspensions to four other players. These are the latest in a series of gambling violations among pro athletes in recent years, after the US Supreme Court cleared the way for states to legalize sports betting\u00a0in 2018. Although leagues had historically opposed it, betting has become increasingly ingrained in US sports culture. \u201cThe longstanding prohibition against betting on Major League Baseball games by those in the sport has been a bedrock principle for over a century.\u00a0We have been clear that the privilege of playing in baseball comes with a responsibility to refrain from engaging in certain types of behavior that are legal for other people,\u201d MLB Commissioner Robert Manfred said when Marcano\u2019s ban was announced. As pro athletes deal with the ramifications of betting on games, a growing number of people are also grappling with mental health issues associated with sports betting. Gambling addiction hotlines across the country have reported a huge surge in traffic in recent years. Texts and chats to the National Problem Gambling Helpline have increased around 800% since 2018 while call volume grew nearly 80%. The national helpline received nearly 359,000 calls and messages last year. But that figure doesn\u2019t offer a complete picture of the requests for help. The national helpline is not able to break out what share of incoming traffic is related to sports betting. State helplines, however, experienced similar upswings after their states approved sports gambling. Calls and messages to the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey, for example, increased 277% from fiscal year 2018 \u2014 when the state first\u00a0legalized sports betting \u2014  to 2022. The Problem Gambling Network of Ohio recorded a 66% surge in call volume in 2023, the first year of legalized sports betting in the state. The annual national social cost of problem gambling \u2014 including job loss and gambling-related criminal justice \u2014 amounts to around $14 billion, according to the National Council on Problem Gambling. An estimated 2.5 million adults in the US \u201cmeet the criteria for a severe gambling problem in a given year.\u201d As more\u00a0people reach out for help, however, the sports betting industry is seeing profits skyrocket. Sports gambling revenue grew from $7.6 billion in 2022 to $11 billion in 2023, according to the American Gaming Association. The first quarter of this year alone brought in $3.33 billion \u2014 a 22% annual increase over the first quarter of 2023. Prior to the Supreme Court decision, Nevada was the only state where sports betting was legal. Now, gamblers can bet on sports legally in 38 states plus\u00a0Washington, DC, according to the American Gaming Association. There\u2019s been an explosion of advertising for sports betting companies in arenas and during broadcasts of games, like the Super Bowl, which feature celebrity sponsors and athletes. Leagues, franchises and networks have also started partnering with betting companies. NBA star LeBron James, for example, became a \u201ctalent ambassador\u201d for Draft Kings \u2014 a popular digital sports betting company \u2014 earlier this year, and ESPN launched an official sports betting platform in 2023. The explosive growth of sports betting has some concerned about gambling and addiction. Despite signing a bill legalizing sports betting in Massachusetts in 2022, former Gov. Charlie Baker \u2014 who is now the president of the National Collegiate Athletic Association \u2014 reportedly said he wished\u00a0\u201csports betting had just stayed in Las Vegas\u201d at a convention in the city this week.\u00a0In January,\u00a0Sen.

{"id": "2024_06_12_sport_caitlin-clark-paris-olympics-basketball-spt-intl", "text": "When looking at the US women\u2019s national team roster for the Paris Olympics, the level of experience jumps off the page. Every member of the team has earned an Olympic or FIBA World Cup gold medal, and the roster has a combined 15 Olympic gold medals, 18 FIBA Women\u2019s World Cup titles and 55 WNBA All-Star appearances. There is, however, one notable omission \u2013 rising star Caitlin Clark. The WNBA rookie has attracted huge audiences during her college career and now with the Indiana Fever, and many believed that, both on and off the court, Clark would have been a vital addition to the team. \u201cWe know the success that Caitlin had in college and she\u2019s had a tremendous start to the WNBA season so far,\u201d USA Basketball Women\u2019s National Team Committee chair Jennifer Rizzotti told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cEssentially, it was the committee\u2019s job to pick the 12 that, based on our selection criteria \u2013 as much as you want to make conversation around how we should have considered TV viewership or jersey sales or popularity, that wasn\u2019t the purview of the committee to have those discussions,\u201d added Rizzotti. \u201cThe selection criteria was made very clear to us. Eventually, we had to block out some of that outside noise \u2026 It was important for our committee to hone in on the criteria that we were given and make this about basketball.\u201d The WNBA season opener between Connecticut Sun and Clark\u2019s Indiana Fever drew an average of 2.1 million viewers on ESPN2, ESPN+ and Disney+, making it the most watched WNBA game in more than two decades. A month prior to Clark\u2019s WNBA debut, the NCAA women\u2019s basketball National Championship matchup between her Iowa Hawkeyes and the South Carolina Gamecocks drew 18.9 million viewers, smashing television ratings records. Speaking to reporters at a practice on Sunday, Clark said that she wasn\u2019t disappointed to be omitted from the team, adding: \u201cI think it gives you something to work for, you know, it\u2019s a dream. Hopefully one day I can be there, and I think it\u2019s just a little more motivation.\u201d There is a chance that Clark could square off against the US women\u2019s national team next month. This year\u2019s\u00a0WNBA All-Star game, which will be held in Phoenix, will pit WNBA All-Stars against Team USA. Three years ago, ahead of the Tokyo Olympics, Team WNBA defeated Team USA in the league\u2019s All-Star game. The USA Women\u2019s basketball team has won gold at seven straight Olympic Games dating back to 1996. This year\u2019s team heading to Paris includes experienced past Olympic champions, including Brittney Griner, Diana Taurasi \u2013 who will make a record sixth consecutive Olympic appearance \u2013 and Breanna Stewart. The 22-year-old Clark would also have been the youngest and most inexperienced player on the team by some distance. Aged 26, Sabrina Ionescu and Jackie Young are the youngest to be selected, but both are already multi-time All-Stars. \u201cWe never once talked about the age of a player when it came down to making this decision,\u201d Rizzotti said on Tuesday. \u201cThere are a lot of players that are at the 26, 27-year range that didn\u2019t make this team when they were 22 and 23, and they\u2019ve worked hard over the last four years to put themselves in a position to make this team when they were playing their best basketball \u2026 The decision for this specific roster came down to experience being imperative.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/sport/caitlin-clark-paris-olympics-basketball-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_sport_flavor-flav-paris-olympics-water-polo-spt-intl", "text": "Flavor Flav has been many things throughout his career: rapper, reality TV star, even restaurant owner. Now, the clock-wearing musician has found a new and unlikely calling in the sports world, offering his services as hype man for the US women\u2019s water polo team ahead of this year\u2019s Paris Olympics. The decision was seemingly spontaneous. Flav decided to get behind the team after seeing an Instagram post from captain Maggie Steffens, who was making a rallying cry for more people to follow the sport with the Olympics looming. \u201cI was definitely shocked and it felt very surreal,\u201d Steffens tells CNN Sport about seeing that Flav had responded to her post. \u201cIt\u2019s great because what water polo needs, and what a lot of these niche sports need, is someone to open the door to our sport. There\u2019s only so much that we as the athletes can do.\u201d Flav, a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee best known for co-founding rap group Public Enemy, hopes to be poolside for some of the USA\u2019s games in Paris. Replying to Steffens on Instagram, he pledged to \u201cuse all my relationships and resources\u201d to support the team in the build-up to the Games. \u201cEverybody wants to know what it feels like to have that chance, and I know what it feels like to want to have a chance,\u201d Flav told TMZ Live last month. \u201cA guy like me, I try to provide that. That\u2019s why I\u2019m sponsoring this women\u2019s water polo team. I just want to help out and I just want to give back. I want to help these women achieve their goals.\u201d And those goals are not insubstantial. Steffens and her peers are aiming to make history in Paris as the first women\u2019s water polo team to win four consecutive Olympic gold medals, with the 30-year-old part of each of the previous three successes. Despite such dominance, the team is still largely unknown to many. Like other sports, water polo can struggle to attract audiences outside the spotlight of the Olympics, which only come around once every four years. That\u2019s where Flav comes in. \u201cThe best way to explain it is he\u2019s being a hype man,\u201d says Steffens. \u201cIt\u2019s honestly less about financial support, more about: how can he help [get] more eyes on our team, on the incredible women of our team and the women who have come before us? How can we get water polo in more people\u2019s mouths and in front of more people\u2019s eyes as best as possible?\u201d USA Water Polo membership almost doubled from 26,837 in 2008 to more than 50,000 in 2019, including increased participation at high school and college levels, according to USA Water Polo. Steffens, who tied the record for the most goals (21) scored at an Olympics as a teenager in 2012, acknowledges that she has seen the sport grow during her 15 years on the national team. However, she wants her legacy to be more than medals, records, and statistics, but making water polo \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d and \u201ccommon language\u201d among the general public. One day, Steffens hopes, people might understand the nuts and bolts of the sport, rather than always asking if you\u2019re allowed to touch the bottom of the pool (you\u2019re not). \u201cSometimes I\u2019ve been told, \u2018oh, too bad you\u2019re not a soccer player\u2019 or \u2018too bad you\u2019re not a basketball player\u2019 or something, because that\u2019s on TV more,\u201d she adds. \u201cBut water polo for me is my whole life. It\u2019s my gift. I wouldn\u2019t be who I am without my sport.\u201d Steffens and her teammates are currently living in Long Beach, California, training for up to seven hours each day in preparation for the Olympics. Right now, the focus is almost solely on water polo \u2013 \u201cas you get close to the Olympics, it\u2019s almost like the knife gets sharpened,\u201d says Steffens \u2013 but that\u2019s not always the case. Most water polo players have other jobs on top of their athletic careers, and for the US women\u2019s team, that means coaching in high schools and colleges, teaching, attending graduate school, or working in marketing and sales. Steffens has co-founded a data company, 6-8 Sports, and has also earned money by playing overseas. \u201cEveryone knows the cost of living in California, and most Olympians are living on minimum wage or under minimum wage,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of times you\u2019re praying for bonus money, you\u2019re praying to win a tournament so that you can afford the things that you need in order to compete, in order to live.\u201d The International Olympic Committee (IOC) doesn\u2019t distribute prize money at the Games, though athletes can earn money from their National Olympic Committees (NOCs), governing bodies, or sponsorship deals. Still, it can be challenging for athletes to fund a place at the Olympics, particularly in smaller, less mainstream sports. The US does not receive government funding for its Olympic programs, and the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee offers \u201climited\u201d financial support to sporting bodies, according to USA Water Polo, which is also funded by membership fees and gift donations. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be an Olympic athlete, unless you are a professional team athlete who makes an Olympic team, you\u2019re going to be basically forced to contribute a fair amount of money as well as time,\u201d Mark Conrad, a professor of law and ethics at Fordham University Gabelli School of Business, tells CNN Sport. \u201cAnd you have to take jobs to do that. I have heard stories of elite track and field members who have worked waiting tables, if they can \u2026 It\u2019s a difficult row to hoe if you\u2019re going to go the Olympic route.\u201d Earlier this year, World Athletics announced that it would be awarding $50,000 to each track and field gold medalist in Paris, becoming the first international federation to award prize money at an Olympics, and added that the bonus initiative would be extended to silver and bronze medalists at the Los Angeles Games in 2028. Boxing then followed suit, offering more than $3.1 million in prize money to athletes, coaches and federations at this year\u2019s Games. The announcements have placed renewed focus on the question of athlete pay at the Olympics \u2013 the most prestigious event for many of the sports being showcased. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what Olympians are able to do with their drive and ambition,\u201d says Steffens. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just water polo \u2013 this is for a lot of these niche sports that aren\u2019t able to get the support through bigger sponsorships or professional leagues.\u201d A talented athlete growing up, Steffens settled on water polo because it combined elements of other sports she enjoyed playing: the ball control of basketball, the fast arm of baseball, the team interplay of soccer, the balance of gymnastics, the physicality of hockey, and the strength and endurance of swimming. \u201cIt\u2019s super tough but I think that\u2019s why it\u2019s so fun,\u201d says Steffens. \u201cAnd it\u2019s truly for anyone. You look at the type of people who play and you look at our team and we\u2019re all different body composition, all different heights.\u201d \u201c[Water polo] can equalize that,\u201d she adds, \u201cand can highlight different strengths in people and can make you really proud of your body and what it can do.\u201d That, Steffens hopes, is something we can all cheer for \u2013 regardless of whether you\u2019re a casual fan or one of the world\u2019s most famous hype men.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/sport/flavor-flav-paris-olympics-water-polo-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Spain\u2019s Lamine Yamal made history on Saturday by becoming the youngest player to appear at a men\u2019s European Championship when he took to the field against Croatia at Euro 2024. At 16 years and 338 days old, Yamal surpassed the previous record set by Poland\u2019s Kacper Koz\u0142owski, who was 17 years and 246 days old when he played against Spain at Euro 2020. Yamal marked his record-breaking appearance against Croatia with an assist in the first half, crossing the ball into the box for Dani Carvajal to poke home en route to a crucial 3-0 Group B win. Yamal already holds the records for being the youngest player to feature for Barcelona and the youngest player to start a match in La Liga in the 21st century. In his first season in Bar\u00e7a\u2019s senior team, Yamal made 37 appearances in La Liga and 10 in the Champions League, finishing the campaign with seven goals and 10 assists in all competitions. Widely considered one of football\u2019s most promising young players, both the Blaugrana and Spain have high hopes that the teenager can help lead them to trophies in the near future. It\u2019s certainly a lot of pressure to put on such slight shoulders, but Yamal has already proven this season, notably with some standout performances in the Champions League, that he has no fear of the biggest stage. \u201cI think he\u2019s so mature and can already make the difference for us,\u201d former Bar\u00e7a head coach Xavi recently told reporters of Yamal. \u201cWe have to take care of him, but I think he\u2019s ready and I\u2019m not afraid to trust youth.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/sport/lamine-yamal-youngest-player-euros-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_sport_fan-caddie-injured-pan-canadian-open-spt-intl", "text": "Soaking up the thrilling climax of the RBC Canadian Open, Paul Emerson wove his way through the crowds to get a good view of the PGA Tour stars on the fourth hole. A few bizarre developments later, he was working for one of them. For two fleeting but fairy tale holes on Sunday, self-professed \u201cgolf nut\u201d Emerson was the star of the show at Ontario\u2019s Hamilton Golf and Country Club, as an injury to C.T. Pan\u2019s caddie Mike \u201cFluff\u201d Cowan presented an impromptu opportunity for one local fan to man the bag at his country\u2019s national open. With Cowan unable to continue after tripping and falling on the third fairway, Taiwan\u2019s Pan saw his clubs picked up by Dan Reynolds, caddie for Irish playing partner Shane Lowry. World No. 33 Lowry had been hauling his own bag as Pan helped Cowan in the direction of medical support, limping past one eager-to-assist spectator in a red Masters T-shirt en route. \u201cWe heard a big tumble and a big sound when Fluff wiped out,\u201d Emerson, a lawyer from nearby Aurora, Ontario, told the PGA Tour. \u201cI just simply offered. I said \u2026 do you need any help?\u201d he told CNN\u2019s \u201cNews Central\u201d on Monday. \u201c(Pan) said yes. And then next thing you know, I\u2019m helping Fluff takeoff the bib and walking up the fairway. It just all happened very fast.\u201d Heart racing, Emerson shook hands with Lowry before throwing the bag over his shoulder \u2013 unprecedented scenes that had not escaped the lenses of TV broadcasters. It was a dream start. Emerson was one-under through one hole for his PGA Tour career after Pan curled home a brilliant birdie putt from just over 20 feet, prompting the 2020 Olympic bronze medalist to toast his new ally with a shout of \u201cgreat caddie\u201d as he plucked his ball from the cup. \u201cOne for one, Paul!\u201d Lowry quipped, adding with a laugh: \u201cIt\u2019s all downhill from here.\u201d Emerson told CNN he had a chance to relax on the next tee. \u201cI just sort of soaked it up and we actually started joking around,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was all very, very friendly and fun.\u201d \u2018I didn\u2019t really want to stop\u2019 With his phone now buzzing incessantly in his pocket, Emerson took the walk up the subsequent fairway as an opportunity to ask Pan what he required. There was only one request: \u201cStay off the greens.\u201d \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m not very chatty\u2019\u201d Emerson recalled to the PGA Tour. \u201cI was like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019ll talk as much or as little as you want. \u201cHe\u2019s a really nice guy \u2013 really friendly.\u201d When asked by CNN whether he gave Pan advice, Emerson chuckled. \u201cThat would be a terrible decision on his part to ask me for guidance,\u201d he said. \u201cMy job was fairly clear, just carry the bag and keep his clubs dry.\u201d Lowry\u2019s tongue-in-cheek jibe was not entirely inaccurate, as Pan bogeyed the par-five hole. The following fairway would mark the end of the road for Emerson\u2019s caddie cameo, as a member of the caddie services team \u2013 Michael Campbell \u2013 arrived to take over from an accepting, albeit reluctant, Emerson. \u201cI said to C.T., \u2018Well, this is your decision,\u2019\u201d added Emerson, whose only previous caddying experience had been for a golfer at a Canadian Women\u2019s Open Pro-Am event. \u201cI didn\u2019t really want to stop, but he took the person who has some local knowledge.\u201d Pan had just made back-to-back birdies when he greeted his fourth bagman of the round, Al Riddell, at the 10th tee. Riddell, who had caddied for France\u2019s Paul Barjon until he missed the cut, had the best possible view of Pan\u2019s stunning eagle \u2013 a 121-yard effort that spun back into the cup \u2013 at the 12th hole. World No. 133 Pan, a one-time winner on the PGA Tour, carded a final round one-under 69 amid damp conditions to finish in tied-35th at three-under overall, 13 shots behind champion Robert MacIntyre. Cowan, 76, was treated for \u201cnonserious\u201d injuries at the clubhouse, a PGA Tour official told ESPN. CNN has reached out to the PGA Tour for an update on Cowan. The Caddie Open Quizzed on his plans for the rest of Sunday, Emerson said he was considering a shirt change to help allay the attention he was receiving around Hamilton Country Club. Yet come the end of Sunday, he had a strong rival for the title of most famous emergency caddie. Having parted ways with his bagman just a week ago, homesick MacIntyre had called on the services of his 59-year-old father Dougie, head greenskeeper at a club back home in Oban, Scotland. The duo dovetailed seamlessly as 27-year-old MacIntyre held off a flurry of big-name stars to clinch his first PGA Tour title, stamping his ticket to the US Open later this month and a $1.69 million prize check he said would go toward paying off his parent\u2019s mortgage. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. I\u2019m a grass cutter not a caddie,\u201d MacIntyre senior, wiping away tears, told CBS Sports. \u201cLast Saturday night, I\u2019m sitting on the couch at home and I\u2019m (thinking), \u2018Can I leave my job here? I\u2019m busy at work.\u2019 Eight o\u2019clock the next morning, I\u2019m on a flight out here and wow.\u201d The Canadian Open is building a reputation for throwing up storylines both beautiful and bizarre. At last year\u2019s tournament, home hero Nick Taylor ended the 69-year wait for a men\u2019s Canadian golfer to win their home open with a remarkable 72-foot eagle putt, only for friend and fellow pro Adam Hadwin to be mistakenly tackled by a security guard amid the ensuing bedlam. Hadwin laughed off the case of mistaken identity soon after, and reconnected with his former feller at this year\u2019s tournament, posting a selfie of the duo smiling to X with the caption: \u201cWater under the bridge!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/sport/fan-caddie-injured-pan-canadian-open-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "sports"}}

To evolve from the hunter and become the hunted \u2013 and not just over the course of a week, month, or perhaps even years. Moreover, to do so over a prolonged period, set against the backdrop of ever-changing competitors, landscapes and the sands of time and physiology. Wheelchair\u00a0tennis player Diede de Groot, though, has been unequivocally the dominant constant in the face of those challenges. \u2018Diede the Great\u2019 \u201cI feel a very big target on my back which is what keeps me motivated,\u201d De Groot told CNN ahead of the French Open. \u201cI know all of these girls are working towards beating me which is fun but intense at the same time. \u201cThey\u2019re not playing with any pressure when they\u2019re playing against me and I have all the pressure because there\u2019s this massive streak that\u2019s following me everywhere. \u201cAt the same time, I really try to forget about all of that and just play tennis.\u201d In a world where we\u2019re inundated daily with statistics ranging from the intriguing to the inane, De Groot\u2019s numbers make for truly remarkable reading. She is the first tennis player \u2013 wheelchair or able-bodied \u2013 ever to win three successive calendar grand slams. She is the first women\u2019s wheelchair tennis player to achieve the Golden Slam \u2013 all four grand slams and a Paralympic gold medal \u2013 in 2021. De Groot is also unbeaten in grand slam tournaments since the 2021 Australian Open, currently boasting a winning streak that has surpassed 130 matches. Based on facts and figures alone, one would be hard pushed to begrudge the 27-year-old for possessing the bold \u2013 yet prophetic and linguistically apt \u2013 social media handle of @DiedetheGreat. \u201cI was too humble to say Diede the Great,\u201d she says smiling. \u201cMy own last name Groot was already taken, so I had to come up with something else and then the literal translation of Groot is great. So that\u2019s how it sort of came to be. \u201cDuring the year, maybe I don\u2019t think about it [records] enough \u2026 especially in tennis because it\u2019s just like a continuous streak of tournaments. It\u2019s difficult to really take time. \u201cBut when I\u2019m just at home sitting, thinking of the amazing things that I\u2019ve already done to this point, I\u2019m very proud of myself.\u201d Wall of Champions So what\u2019s the secret of the Dutch star\u2019s success? \u201cI don\u2019t think I have the biggest serve. I don\u2019t think I have the biggest forehand,\u201d De Groot reflected. \u201cI just think that I\u2019m very good at all of the levels \u2026 I\u2019m a complete player. \u201cI don\u2019t really have a weak point and that\u2019s very difficult for opponents to, to play against.\u201d De Groot\u2019s current grand slam singles tally stands at 21. Her latest victory at this year\u2019s Australian Open was not only a remarkable 13th in a row but it also drew her level alongside the great Esther Vergeer\u2019s grand slam tally. Vergeer\u2019s 21st and final major title came at Roland Garros in 2012. Whilst De Groot still has some way to go to encroach on her compatriots astonishing 470-match unbeaten winning streak, it\u2019s fitting then that she\u2019ll have the chance to become the most successful women\u2019s wheelchair tennis player of all time at this year\u2019s French Open. Victory in Paris would consolidate De Groot\u2019s position as third in the all-time list of overall grand slam champions across singles and doubles. The 27-year-old\u2019s current tally stands at 39. Vergeer finished her career with 42 titles, second only to Japan\u2019s recently retired Shingo Kunieda, the most decorated men\u2019s player in the history of wheelchair tennis, who amassed an astonishing 50 majors. Hotbed of talent Aside from her technical prowess, the foundations of De Groot\u2019s trophy-laden career \u2013 and for that matter her compatriot Vergeer\u2019s \u2013 can also be attributed to the Dutch tennis system. It\u2019s one which allows wheelchair tennis to integrate with able-bodied players, a strategy that has worked to stunning effect. \u201cI started wheelchair tennis when I was seven years old \u2026 I had a few operations done on my hip [and] the rehabilitation center advised me: \u2018Hey, would you like tennis?\u2019 I picked it up, and I loved it straight away,\u201d said De Groot, who was born with unequal leg length. \u201cTo have that feeling that I could play tennis just like all the other kids in the group \u2026 it was very special to have that. \u201cWe are fully integrated into the KNLTB [Royal Dutch Lawn Tennis Association] program. We are treated like athletes [and] being taken seriously really helps taking yourself seriously.\u201d The KNLT\u2019s National Tennis Centre, located in Amstelveen, boasts 14 outdoor and 14 indoor courts with accessibility for wheelchair tennis. \u201cTwenty years ago wheelchair tennis was one of the biggest Paralympic sports in the Netherlands,\u201d says De Groot. \u201cWe already were very lucky to have a very good number one gold medalist [Vergeer] and because we were such a small country, we could all see each other play. \u201cAnd just learning from previous generations \u2026 I could learn from the women that went before me. I could see it from up close and therefore mimic it or even try to do better.\u201d De Groot and Vergeer both herald from the historic Dutch city of Woerden, which has produced a conveyor belt of some of the greatest players from The Netherlands to have ever graced the sport. So is there something special in the Woerden waters. \u201cWe lived very close to each other which is actually quite special,\u201d De Groot says. \u201cAnother world number one \u2013 Jiske Griffioen \u2013 also comes from there. So, it\u2019s just a coincidence \u2026 but it\u2019s a funny coincidence!\u201d \u2018We are being noticed\u2019 Wheelchair tennis events are now gradually being incorporated into a growing number of ATP and WTA events. The prestigious Miami Open hosted an event for the very first time earlier this year and Wimbledon has announced it will double the size of the wheelchair draws for this summer\u2019s tournament. \u201cI would say that from history, Paralympics were always the moment that all eyes were on us,\u201d reflected De Groot. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have to share it with able-bodied athletes. \u201cBut then for another four years, we would sort of fall to the background again \u2026 now I really feel like these players are noticing us. They\u2019re recognizing us and interacting with us more and more. \u201cI saw Jannik Sinner play with our world No. 1 Alfie Hewitt [in Miami]. Novak \u2026 he\u2019s done some really good promotion with Dylan Alcott before so hopefully these moments will be more and more \u201cCountries are developing their programs and players are developing their games. It\u2019s a really fun time to be a wheelchair tennis player.\u201d Paris 2024 When it came to the Covid-impacted Tokyo Games, the Dutch star had an unprecedented weight of history of her shoulders. Dutch women have won every wheelchair tennis title \u2013 singles and doubles \u2013 since it became a medal event 32 years ago. De Groot stormed to singles and doubles gold without dropping a set in either competition. It remains one of the defining moments of her career. \u201cFor a long time, a lot of people ask me that without gold, your career wouldn\u2019t be complete. I never thought about it that way. \u201cWinning gold in Tokyo really felt like it was like a completion of so many years already that I\u2019ve been doing so well. So many things came from winning those medals that it definitely sparked something around me, which is very good.\u201d The Dutch phenom is on track to return to the clay courts of Roland Garros to defend her titles this summer at Paris 2024. It\u2019s a challenge she\u2019s relishing and with her imperious track record to date in the French capital \u2013 winning a total of nine grand slam titles \u2013 you\u2019d be a brave person to bet against her. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a different Paralympics,\u201d she says. \u201c[I] played in Rio. I was very new there. [I] Played in Tokyo. No one was allowed to come and watch and I had all the pressure there. And now I\u2019m a defending champion with everyone there. \u201cIt will mean everything [to defend the titles]. It\u2019s the goal that I\u2019m aiming at. \u201cI still have many tournaments before so my head is not yet there, but it will be and I\u2019m going to enjoy it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/sport/diede-de-groot-tennis-unstoppable-force-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_sport_kathleen-noble-rowing-uganda-paris-olympics-spt-intl", "text": "From learning how to row in boats patched together with duct tape to competing at the world championships in a different sport entirely, Kathleen Noble\u2019s rise to the apex of rowing has certainly been unconventional. Her journey now sees the 29-year-old set to become a two-time Olympian \u2013 Noble represented Uganda at the Tokyo Games \u2013 when she competes at Paris 2024. She is Uganda\u2019s first Olympic rowing participant, as well as the African nation\u2019s first and only White Olympian across any sporting discipline. A prodigious swimmer in her youth, Noble represented Uganda at the 2012 World Swimming Championships at just 17 years of age. Then, on a whim during her time as a student at Princeton University, Noble was convinced to try her hand at rowing. \u201cWhen I took my first steps into the sport, I had no thoughts or intentions of competing at a high level and certainly couldn\u2019t have imagined that this would be the direction that things would go,\u201d Noble tells CNN Sport. \u201cTo be honest, it is still a bit surreal to be competing on a stage like this. I don\u2019t think it was until they actually told me that Uganda wanted to send me to the Olympic qualifiers that I really thought, \u2018Oh, okay, maybe there\u2019s something here.\u2019\u201d Equipment issues The sport of rowing is still very much in its nascent stages across many parts of Africa, including Uganda. It was properly introduced to the country back in 2009 when the World Rowing Federation sent out a shipment of donated boats to help to grow a sport which carries with it significant financial entry barriers. It was on these boats that Noble learned to row skull (individual), as opposed to her time rowing crew (as a team in one boat) at university. Whilst the thought of training on Lake Victoria, one of Africa\u2019s Great Lakes and the world\u2019s largest tropical lake, may bring with it a sense of charm and serenity, trying to prepare to compete at Olympic level just isn\u2019t feasible given the lack of opportunities and investment afforded to rowing within Uganda, a reality which sees Noble now train out of Tennessee under former US rower James Martinez. \u201cThere is no history of rowing in Uganda. I mean, I\u2019m literally the first person, male or female, to even qualify for the Olympics,\u201d Noble says. \u201cIt is still extremely niche, and the community is very small. I probably know every single rower in the country personally. \u201cBack in 2016, I took eight months off from university to row in Uganda and I\u2019m so grateful that I did because I got to experience first-hand all the struggles that rowers back home go through on a daily basis. \u201cNot only is there a lack of competition and adequate coaching, but there is a lack of most basic essentials, such as having properly functioning equipment. \u201cWhen I was rowing on Lake Victoria, we were still using the boats donated back in 2009. We would be duct-taping them and trying to get people to patch them up with fiberglass for us.\u201d It is not just a lack of equipment which has hampered rowing\u2019s growth in the east African country. Governance is also a major issue, and the absence of proper oversight has seen many athletes leave the sport in recent times, according to Noble, due to \u201cpromises being made but not always being kept.\u201d The only way the sport has a chance to progress is through the help and funding from outside donors such as the World Rowing Federation. Muhumuza Rodrick Chandi,\u00a0the technical director of the Uganda\u00a0Rowing Federation, tells CNN Sport that the price of equipment and a lack of coaches has been an issue in the country. \u201cIt is true that there is a lack of coaches as most qualified ones have left Uganda in search of greener pastures,\u201d he says.\u00a0\u201cRowing, like most sports in Uganda, is voluntary, so once these coaches get better opportunities they migrate or leave the sport altogether. \u201cThe Ugandan Rowing Federation does suffer from a lack of funding, mainly because it doesn\u2019t get much budgetary support from the National Council of Sports as it\u2019s considered a small sport.\u201d \u2018Honor\u2019 representing Uganda Born in Nakaseke, central Uganda, in 1994, Noble is the daughter of Irish missionaries. \u201cUganda was a fantastic place to grow up in many ways, whether it be the great weather all year round or the friendly and cheerful nature of the people,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut as a White, blonde child, I maybe would have had an aversion to going out in public due to the amount of attention I\u2019d have gotten.\u201d Despite her differences, of which Noble is acutely aware, sport has allowed her to form a deeper connection with her birthplace. \u201cEven though I have Ugandan citizenship, there is an identity to being Ugandan which is about coming from one of the local tribes and having land and a history and ancestors going back a long way,\u201d she says. \u201cI respect that, but at the same time, I did grow up in Uganda. It\u2019s a place that is important to me and it does mean a lot to me to have people accept me as being Ugandan. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge honor to represent my country. It\u2019s been the way that I\u2019ve felt the most connection to my identity as a Ugandan. Growing up there, when people ask you where you\u2019re from, I would say Ireland, even though I was born and grew up there. \u201cBut I feel like as I\u2019ve gotten deeper into representing and rowing for the country, I have felt more strongly that I am Ugandan.\u201d Noble\u2019s acceptance by Ugandan sports fans has also been a great source of encouragement. While she says that she will occasionally receive the odd message on social media criticizing her for representing the country, the overwhelming majority of both fan and media messaging has been support and pride for raising the profile of Ugandan rowing. \u201cYou\u2019re always going to have haters and people who want to try to knock you down, that\u2019s kind of to be expected in high level sport nowadays with social media \u2026 but I find it extremely touching that whenever I am met with negativity, a barrage of positivity will follow,\u201d says Noble. \u201cI\u2019m very, very grateful for that.\u201d Platform for change Noble, on top of her sporting ambitions, works as a software engineer in Tennessee and, alongside her husband, is a homesteader with a small-scale farm producing food and animals for themselves. Like every athlete, she hopes that her Olympic journey will culminate atop the podium, but she does also head to Paris with a compelling sense of realism. \u201cRowing is not really a sport where you wake up and just have a great day and row faster than you ever have before,\u201d says Noble. \u201cIt is a little bit more deterministic than that. Sports that are really based around cardiovascular strength tend to remove that element of major surprise around results. I\u2019m not going to flat out say that my goal isn\u2019t to medal, but at the same time I need to be realistic.\u201d Winning a medal is not the only means by which you can determine an Olympian\u2019s success, though, with Noble hoping that her exposure during the Games can help to elevate rowing back in Uganda, ensuring that she is no longer its sole representative. \u201cI feel a sense of responsibility to try and help support athletes back home,\u201d she says. \u201cWhether that correlates to me having to do well, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily true. I get a lot of press whether I come first or last. \u201cI believe that the actual position that I come is less important than the spotlight that exists around the Olympics. That gives me the platform to raise awareness about the limitations and struggles that athletes have in Uganda to a global audience.\u201d Rowing, particularly singles rowing, can be a very isolating sport, a fact that Noble can attest to. But come July 26 when the Paris Games get underway, she will have the backing of an entire nation eager to witness what will, no matter the end result, be more Olympic history for Uganda.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/sport/kathleen-noble-rowing-uganda-paris-olympics-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "sports"}}

CNN has reached out to Rodgers\u2019 representatives to ask what event he attended rather participating in the minicamp. Back-up quarterback Tyrod Taylor will handle the first-team reps in camp with Rodgers away, the Jets said.  According to the NFL\u2019s collective bargaining agreement, players who miss the first day of mandatory minicamp with an unexcused reason can be subject to a $16,953 fine. Missing a second day comes with a $33,908 fine for the second day and $50,855 for a third day. According to Spotrac, Rodgers\u2019 2024 cap hit will be just over $17 million, with a $3,161,112 base salary, a $7 million signing bonus and a $7 million option. The Jets\u2019 mandatory minicamp began on Tuesday and runs until Thursday. According to the NFL, all teams can \u201cconduct one one mandatory minicamp during Phase Three of the offseason workout program.\u201d Previous offseason workouts were voluntary, but skipping minicamp is a finable offense. While a veteran player missing mandatory minicamp isn\u2019t unheard of, it is notable that Rodgers is absent after how his debut season with the Jets transpired. Rodgers missed the majority of the 2023 season after tearing his Achilles tendon on the four snaps of his first game for the team having arrived in the offseason with much fanfare. Although there were rumors near the end of the season that Rodgers might make a shock return to the field, the quarterback did not and instead chose to continue rehabilitation for his injury. While Rodgers is missing the opening of the Jets\u2019 mandatory minicamp, the 41-year-old has been on the practice field already with his teammates, with the team\u2019s social media account showing him throwing the ball and participating in drills. Rodgers is not the only Jet to be missing from minicamp, with pass rusher Haason Reddick also absent with an unexcused reason. \u201cI spoke to him over the weekend,\u201d Saleh said of Reddick. \u201cI appreciate the dialogue. He\u2019s in a really good place mentally, working his tail off like we already know. But he\u2019s choosing to sit out this one unexcused.\u201d Reddick was traded to New York from the Philadelphia Eagles in the offseason having got 11 sacks last year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/sport/aaron-rodgers-missing-ny-jets-mandatory-minicamp-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_sport_kylian-mbappe-france-euro-2024-spt-intl", "text": "Sardinia, Italy (CNN) \u2013 Take one look inside Kylian Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s trophy cabinet and you\u2019ll already find little room for maneuver. World Cup winner. Check. Golden Ball winner. Check. Multiple domestic league winner. Check. These to name just some of the few glowing accolades on his glistening CV. And yet the global soccer superstar of our time admits that there remains so much more to do and win. At the club level, a maiden Champions League title is the glaring, haunting omission. On an individual level, the crown jewel that is the Ballon d\u2019Or has so far eluded him. So what about at the international level? As he prepares for his fourth major tournament with France, the answer is definitive. \u201cI want to win the Euros. I have to be honest,\u201d Mbapp\u00e9 told CNN Sport\u2019s Amanda Davies after being crowned Best Men\u2019s Player at the inaugural Globe Soccer Awards Europe Edition in Sardinia, Italy. \u201cI won the World Cup. I won the Nations League. That\u2019s the only one that missed me with the national team after I did everything with the national team. \u201cI really want to win this. My first competition as captain, so it\u2019s really important for me and it\u2019s always important for the country and we want them to be proud of us. \u201c[It\u2019s] another opportunity to write the history of my country.\u201d \u2018France\u2019s biggest enemy is France\u2019 Les Bleus go into this summer\u2019s European Championship as one of the favorites to win the title on German soil. The favorites tag is based not only on recent success on the global stage but also down to a squad boasting an almost immeasurable level of talent and depth throughout. \u201cWe have three squads, three teams. We can put in any player and the team will still look strong,\u201d France\u2019s Euro 2016 runner-up Patrice Evra told CNN Sport\u2019s Davies at the recent Laureus World Sports Awards in Madrid, Spain. \u201cThe biggest enemy for France is France. That\u2019s the truth because, sometimes, we get carried away. We can be too arrogant and don\u2019t respect the opponent.\u201d On paper and world rankings alone, France\u2019s group in this year\u2019s edition of the tournament \u2013 featuring Netherlands, Austria and Poland \u2013 appears navigable, albeit one with the potential for slip ups. The prolific marksman is under no illusions of the task that lies ahead, insisting France will be going about its business one game at a time. \u201cEverybody knows how tough it is to win the Euros because all the teams are very strong,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can see the group that we have \u2026 It\u2019s like something crazy! \u201cWe have to go step-by-step because it\u2019s going to be really difficult, but we are ready for that.\u201d World Cup hangover Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s side begins its latest campaign against Austria in D\u00fcsseldorf on June 17. Les Bleus\u2019 track record, though, in the tournament since victory in 2000 has been far from flattering. Since assuming the role of head coach in 2012, Deschamps has yet to taste Euros glory, with the country\u2019s best result under his tenure being a runner-up spot in 2016 on home soil. Four years ago, France was unceremoniously dumped out of the competition  in the last-16 by Switzerland on penalties with Mbapp\u00e9 missing the decisive spot-kick. The ante, therefore, for Germany 2024 has been upped. But as soccer fans from around the world have come to find out in recent years, France often saves its best for the biggest stage. Six years ago, the squad steamrolled to World Cup success in Russia and reached the final in Qatar less than two years ago. Despite a sensational hat-trick, Mbapp\u00e9 and France tasted defeat in an instant classic final to Argentina, putting an end to hopes of becoming the first team to win back-to-back World Cup titles in 60 years, since Brazil did so in 1958 and 1962. Did the 25-year-old think a World Cup hangover could derail future title ambitions? \u201cI think we have to move forward,\u201d stated the recently-signed Real Madrid forward. \u201cOf course, we were hurt, to see that you\u2019re close to something \u2026 Close to the back-to-back. Something amazing. Something historic. \u201cEverybody loved the game except for us. We didn\u2019t like that, but it\u2019s part of the game. \u201cNow, when I watch the video of the game, I watch with a smile because it\u2019s part of the history and we know what we have to do if we go again in the final. We have to play all the game and no have reaction.\u201d Olympic ambitions As it stands, Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s sole focus this summer is on chasing European glory. The prospect, though, of representing his country at the Olympics in his home city of Paris remains a tantalizing possibility \u2013 this despite the Parisian being left out of coach Thierry Henry\u2019s provisional 25-man preliminary squad  for the Games. \u201cI am not closing the door on hope; we don\u2019t know what will happen. But I must present a realistic list. The list is open to everyone,\u201d the legendary French forward and 1998 World Cup winner recently told reporters at a press conference, adding that he had up until July 3 to change the squad. France captured gold at Los Angeles 1984 and is hoping for a repeat success four decades later. As the Olympic soccer tournament is not on FIFA\u2019s international calendar, clubs are not obliged to release their players. The son of the Parisian suburb of Bondy, though, is open to all eventualities and the lure of playing at a home Games may prove too alluring. \u201cOf course, I think about the Olympics. It\u2019s normal. Every player wants to play in the Olympics. It\u2019s not dependent on me [\u2026] I don\u2019t want to be in the mood like I force everybody to do my thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand every position. When you take a decision, you have to think about the position of everybody and understand the position of everybody. \u201cI accept everything. I want to be happy. If I go, I\u2019m going to be happy. If I stay, I\u2019m going to be happy anyway.\u201d His bigger hope, though, is for Paris to put on a show like no other and demonstrate its uniqueness, diversity, and sporting and cultural excellence to the watching world. \u201cI hope everybody is going to see that Paris is the city of sport and we can do all the things good to receive all the world and share something amazing,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cIf I\u2019m here or not that\u2019s not important. The most important thing is to show the best image of our country. That we are ready to accept everybody to Paris, to enjoy it and to fight for the gold medals in every sport.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/sport/kylian-mbappe-france-euro-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_sport_euro-2024-switzerland-hungary-spain-croatia-italy-albania-spt-intl", "text": "Spain kicked off its Euro 2024 campaign with a statement 3-0 win over Croatia to earn a vital three points in the tournament\u2019s \u2018Group of Death.\u2019 La Roja was out of the blocks rapidly and made Croatia pay for a sluggish start. First-half goals from \u00c1lvaro Morata, Fabi\u00e1n Ruiz and Dani Carvajal \u2013 fresh from scoring in the Champions League final \u2013 opened up a dominant lead that the Kockasti never looked like coming back from. As well as Spain and Croatia, Group B also features defending champion Italy \u2013 all three teams are ranked in the top 10 of FIFA\u2019s world rankings \u2013 and surprise package Albania, which finished top of its qualifying group ahead of Czechia and Poland. It was an uncharacteristically sloppy start for a vastly experienced Croatia side, which has punched above its weight at international tournaments in recent years, reaching the final and then the semifinal at consecutive World Cups. The midfield trio of Luka Modri\u0107, Marcelo Brozovi\u0107\u00a0and Mateo Kova\u010di\u0107 alone boasted 372 caps for Croatia but were largely ineffective throughout. The Croatian defense was pulled apart with ease for the opening goal just before the half hour mark, allowing Morata to run through on goal from Ruiz\u2019s pass and calmly slot the ball past Dominik Livakovi\u0107. That strike moved the 31-year-old up to joint-third on the all-time scoring list at European Championships with seven goals, behind only Cristiano Ronaldo and Michel Platini. The next goal came just three minutes later as Ruiz danced around weak challenges from Modri\u0107 and Brozovi\u0107 on the edge of the area before drilling the ball low into the bottom corner. Carvajal then made it three on the stroke of half-time, timing his run perfectly to slide into the six-yard box and turn Lamine Yamal\u2019s pinpoint cross past Livakovi\u0107. Both teams had plenty of chances to add to the scoreline in the second half, but were thwarted by poor finishing and a brilliant save from Livakovi\u0107 which denied Barcelona youngster Yamal a record-breaking goal. Croatian fans thought they at least had a moment to cheer in the closing stages when Bruno Petkovi\u0107 scored at the second attempt after seeing his initial penalty saved. However, the video assistant referee (VAR) ruled that Ivan Peri\u0161i\u0107 had encroached into the area during the spot kick before he squared the ball back to Petkovi\u0107. It capped a miserable afternoon for Croatia and the team will have to improve dramatically when it faces Albania and Italy to have any hope of qualifying for the knockout stages. Italy vs. Albania Defending champion Italy had to come from a goal behind to earn an unconvincing 2-1 against win against Albania. An early Azzurri error gifted Albania the lead after just 23 seconds, as Nedim Bajrami pounced to score the fastest goal in European Championship history. However, two goals in the space of five minutes from Alessandro Bastoni and Nicol\u00f2 Barella quickly turned the game on its head and Italy was able to hold on for three important points in the \u2018Group of Death.\u2019 Though far from a vintage Italian performance, this team is vastly experienced and knows how to defend a lead and see out a game when it matters the most. Next up will be the far greater challenge of Spain when the two teams meet in a crunch clash on Thursday, with a winner guaranteed a place in the knockout stages. Italy\u2019s night got off to the worst start imaginable when Federico Dimarco\u2019s errant throw-in went straight to Bajrami\u2019s feet, allowing the forward to shift the ball to his right and hammer his effort in at the near post. But Italy found an equalizer only 10 minutes later after poor defending left Bastoni completely unmarked at the far post to head home from Lorenzo Pellegrini\u2019s cross. Barella\u2019s goal five minutes later capped a frenzied opening 15 minutes, hitting a crisp strike past goalkeeper Thomas Strakosha after the ball had bounced around inside the penalty area. The Kuqezinjt\u00eb applied plenty of pressure in the closing stages and Italy had goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma to thank for keeping out Rey Manaj\u2019s effort when the Albania forward was through on goal. It was stoic performance in the second half from Albania, the second-lowest ranked team in the tournament, and the players lined up in front of their fans to soak in the applause in what is only the country\u2019s second appearance at a European Championship. Hungary vs. Switzerland First-half goals from Kwadwo Duah and Michel Aebischer set Switzerland on course for a crucial, hard-fought 3-1 win over Hungary in Group A. Barnab\u00e1s Varga pulled a goal back for a much improved Hungary in the second half, but Breel Embolo capitalized on a defensive error to put the game beyond doubt in stoppage time.

Since bursting onto the WNBA scene after a record-breaking college career, Clark has found herself being used by controversial figures on social media to push their own agendas in American culture wars. On Thursday, the Indiana Fever guard was asked by a reporter to clarify comments she\u2019d made earlier in the day, when she said she \u201ccan\u2019t control\u201d people weaponizing her name in talking about racism and misogyny. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing,\u201d replied Clark ahead of the Indiana Fever\u2019s home game against the Atlanta Dream. \u201cI think everybody in our world deserves the same amount of respect. The women in our league deserve the same amount of respect. So, people should not be using my name to push those agendas. It\u2019s disappointing. \u201cIt\u2019s not acceptable \u2026 this is a league I grew up admiring and wanting to be a part of. Like some of the women of this league were my biggest idols and role models growing up and helped me want to achieve this moment right here I get to play in every single night,\u201d added Clark. While she has helped attract thousands more fans to the WNBA this season, discourse around the 22-year-old Clark often focuses on topics away from the court. Her rivalry with fellow star Angel Reese, for example, has triggered discourse about race in the US. Earlier this month, Reese said of the rivalry with Clark: \u201cPeople are pulling up to games, we got celebrities coming to games, sold out arenas, just because of [the 2023 NCAA championship game]. \u201cAnd just looking at that, I\u2019ll take that role. I\u2019ll take the bad guy role, and I\u2019ll continue to take that on and be that for my teammates.\u201d Reese continued: \u201cI\u2019ll look back in 20 years and be like, \u2018Yeah, the reason why we\u2019re watching women\u2019s basketball is not just because of one person. It\u2019s because of me too,\u2019 and I want y\u2019all to realize that. \u201c \u2018It\u2019s not something I can control\u2019 Earlier on Thursday, Clark was asked whether people using her name in the culture wars was something that bothered her. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I can control,\u201d Clark had initially told reporters. \u201cSo, I don\u2019t put too much time into thinking about things like that.\u201d The response grew the ire of Connecticut Sun guard DiJonai Carrington, who wrote a social media post Thursday criticising Clark, adding that \u201csilence is a luxury.\u201d \u201cDawg. How one can not be bothered by their name being used to justify racism, bigotry, misogyny, xenophobia, homophobia & the intersectionalities of them all is nuts,\u201d Carrington said on X, formerly known as Twitter. Clark has had a mixed start to her WNBA career so far, showing flashes of her brilliance but struggling initially with the physicality of the professional game. The Indiana Fever are set to play Chicago Sky in its next game on Sunday, where Clark will once again reignite her on-court rivalry with Reese. In an interview with USA Today on Wednesday, WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert said the league was \u201cthrilled with the rivalries that are being built.\u2019\u2019 \u201cShe obviously captures a viewer we haven\u2019t had before, which is great,\u2019\u2019 said Engelbert of Clark. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled with Caitlin and the generational players that have come in,\u201d added Engelbert, who referenced the play of rookies Reese and Cameron Brink in her USA Today interview. \u201cLook, apathy is the death of a brand,\u201d continued Engelbert. \u201cNobody\u2019s apathetic about the WNBA because we\u2019ve brought in so many new fans into what we call the fan funnel this year.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/sport/caitlin-clark-culture-wars-wnba-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "sports"}}

The league said, during spring training, an investigation was opened on Hoberg, 37, for a \u201cpotential violation of MLB\u2019s sports betting policies\u201d and he was removed from the field of play. MLB has not announced the exact discipline for Hoberg, but he has not umpired a game this season. The Athletic first reported the story on Hoberg\u2019s discipline.

Four other players were also banned for a year apiece for violating betting rules.

{"id": "2024_06_14_sport_willie-mack-iii-us-open-car-spt-intl", "text": "For even the most talented golfers, it\u2019s a long road to the US Open. Willie Mack III knows that better than anyone \u2013 he\u2019s slept on several of them. The Michigan-born 35-year-old made an impressive start on his major debut at the 124th edition of his national open on Thursday, outperforming some of the game\u2019s biggest names amid supremely challenging conditions at Pinehurst\u2019s No.2 course in North Carolina. A one-over par 71 matched the best efforts of world No.1 and overwhelming tournament favorite Scottie Scheffler, while trumping the opening scores carded by an array of other stars, from defending winner Wyndham Clark to multiple major champion Jordan Spieth and Mack\u2019s very own idol, Tiger Woods. Yet just over a decade ago, as Woods eased ever closer to the all-time PGA Tour win record, Mack was easing himself into his Ford Mustang to settle down for the night. While 15-time major winner Woods was granted a special exemption \u2013 the first of his career \u2013 to tee it up this week, Mack has taken a far more winding path to Pinehurst. The abridged version is that he stamped his ticket by edging through a qualifying playoff in Florida last week, but that does little to capture all the contours of an arduous journey. Born in Flint, Mack scooped a host of junior titles in his home city before turning heads with a decorated college career that saw him clinch 11 individual titles at Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, Florida. In 2011, he became the first Black player to win the Michigan Amateur Championship. In a 2021 interview with Michigan-based media group MLive, Mack said he had experienced racial prejudice during his time in youth golf. \u201cGrowing up, going to some courses \u2026 you get looks or just don\u2019t get treated the same way,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think that\u2019s just life. You have to deal with it, keep your head on straight and keep moving.\u201d \u2018I just thought it was embarassing\u2019 Mack turned professional a few months after that triumph, throwing himself into regional circuits like the Florida Professional Golf Tour, as well as the Advocates Professional Golf Association (APGA) Tour, launched to promote diversity in the sport. The first year went well, but Mack soon felt the financial strain of funding his own way around the country to a myriad of mini-tours \u2013 more than 30 and counting, he estimated to Golf.com earlier this week. By 2012, he was sleeping on the sofas of friends or \u2013 unbeknownst to his mother \u2013 in his own car. For more than year and a half, the latter setup would see Mack park up at tournaments well before tee off time to take a shower and avoid being noticed, he said. \u201cAt the time, I just thought it was embarrassing,\u201d Mack told Golf.com. \u201cBut that\u2019s all I had to try and get by. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s people that people don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going through and doing things you\u2019d never expect \u2026 \u201cI would actually practice more because I just didn\u2019t want to get back in the car. I would go to the mall a lot and just walk around, things to not be in the car. And then play a tournament and do it all again tomorrow.\u201d Repeated attempts to make it onto the PGA Tour through qualifying school fell short, but a breakthrough arrived in 2018 when Mack battled his way onto the PGA Tour Latinoamerica. He played only two events \u2013 making just $766 in total \u2013 but it would mark the start of increasingly regular outings on the game\u2019s most prestigious circuits. Last year, he played 20 tournaments on the Korn Ferry Tour \u2013 the PGA Tour\u2019s developmental track \u2013 earning just over $45,000 in prize money in the process. Ahead of this week, Mack has played seven PGA Tour events, his best performance a tied-64th finish at the 2021 John Deere Classic. \u2018You just gotta keep fighting\u2019 Yet heading into this month, a major appearance had remained agonizingly elusive. It had not been for the want of trying, with Mack agonizingly missing out on a US Open field spot a few years ago by losing in a playoff. Fast-forward to The Bear\u2019s Club in Orlando on June 3, and the journeyman golfer found himself in the same position once again. Dubbed \u2018golf\u2019s longest day,\u2019 the final round of US Open qualifying sees amateurs and professionals alike embark on a grueling 36-hole marathon to clinch the final few starting places at the major. Having battled through local qualifying in April, Mack finished in a three-way tie for the fifth and final spot available to the 73 hopefuls at Bear\u2019s Club. With both his counterparts bogeying in succession, back-to-back pars were enough for Mack to exorcise his playoff demons and stamp his ticket to Pinehurst. \u201cYou just gotta keep fighting. My Dad always told me never to give up and I always keep that in the back of my mind,\u201d Mack told NBC Sports after his triumph. \u201cTo be able to do it today is remarkable. I can\u2019t believe it actually happened,\u201d he added. Among the first groups to tee off Thursday, Mack\u2019s name floated near the top of the leaderboard for some time as the world No. 1351 raced out of the blocks with two birdies across his first six holes. He was two-under as he geared up for the final four holes, a score that would have ultimately put him within just three shots of round one leaders Rory McIlroy and Patrick Cantlay, only for three late bogeys to bump him above par. Even so, Mack put up a showing the majority of the 156-player would have happily taken as a firm and fast No. 2 course chewed up many of the game\u2019s elite. \u201cI wasn\u2019t as nervous as I probably was before playing in some PGA Tour events,\u201d Mack told reporters after his round. \u201cPlaying full season last year, I guess it got me ready for these type of situations. It\u2019s still the US Open, so you got to focus, put your head down and hit some great shots.\u201d Among the final groups to start their second round at 2:42 p.m. ET (7:42 p.m. BST) on Friday, Flint is well-positioned to make the cut and pen a major weekend chapter in the long story of his career. \u201cIt\u2019s a special week for me,\u201d he added. \u201cEverything happens for a reason. I think this is my time to play well.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/sport/willie-mack-iii-us-open-car-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "sports"}}

The 11-time LPGA Tour champion revealed her decision ahead of her 18th consecutive US Women\u2019s Open appearance this week, 17 years since she burst onto the scene when \u2013 at just 12-years-old \u2013 she became the then-youngest player to ever qualify for the tournament. Having turned professional three years later in 2010, the Floridian clinched major glory at the 2014 Kraft Nabisco Championship \u2013 now the Chevron Championship \u2013 and represented Team USA at six Solheim Cups, as well as two Olympic Games. \u201cWhile it is never easy to say goodbye, it is indeed time,\u201d Thompson wrote in a letter, accompanied by a video, on Instagram. \u201cI\u2019m excited to enjoy the remainder of the year as there are still goals I want to accomplish. I\u2019m looking forward to the next chapter of my life. Time with family, friends, and my trusted companion [dog], Leo. \u201cI will always look for ways to contribute to the sport and inspire the next generation of golfers. And of course, I look forward to a little time for myself.\u201d Thompson peaked as high as world No.4 as she amassed a string of titles, but injuries contributed to a gradual drop in ranking to world No. 54. She has not registered a victory on the LPGA Tour since June 2019, but did win an individual title at the Aramco Team Series \u2013 a Ladies European Tour (LET) event \u2013 in October 2022. Finishing eight times inside the top-three at the five flagship events, Thompson repeatedly came agonizingly close to adding to her sole major crown, including an infamous near-miss at the 2017 ANA Inspiration (now Chevron Championship). A rules violation for mismarking her ball \u2013 reported by a TV viewer \u2013 saw Thompson hit with a four-shot penalty during the third round. Though she rallied to make a playoff, she was subsequently defeated by South Korea\u2019s Ryu So-yeon. \u201cYou haven\u2019t always been easy on me, or fair for that matter, but through all the ups and downs, you\u2019ve given me a platform to inspire others and positively impact the world,\u201d Thompson said in her letter. \u201cThat has been a driving force that kept me playing and relentlessly working to be better.\u201d \u2018A whirlwind of constant attention, scrutiny and pressure\u2019 Thompson spoke through tears during a press conference at Pennsylvania\u2019s Lancaster Country Club, US Women\u2019s Open host, on Tuesday. Her letter described a \u201cwhirlwind of constant attention, scrutiny and pressure\u201d since her breakthrough as a 12-years-old, with social media playing its part in Thompson sometimes finding it \u201cexhausting to maintain a smile on the outside while grappling with struggles on the inside.\u201d Asked what she was most proud of for overcoming during her career, a tearful Thompson answered: \u201cJust staying true to myself. Being out here can be a lot. It can be lonely. \u201cI\u2019ll be the last one to say like throw me a pity party. That\u2019s the last thing I want. We\u2019re doing what we love. We\u2019re trying the best every single day. You know, we\u2019re not perfect. We\u2019re humans. Words hurt. It\u2019s hard to overcome sometimes. \u201cBut having the people around you that love you and support you, I feel like that\u2019s been the biggest thing for me. I might not have a huge friend group, but to have the people that matter the most around me have gotten me through some really hard times.\u201d In October, Thompson became just the seventh woman ever to compete at the PGA Tour event when she teed up at the Shriners Open, narrowly missing out on making the cut after shooting even-par. Earlier this year, she joined compatriot Rose Zhang as the first women to take part in The Match, squaring off against PGA Tour stars Rory McIlroy and Max Homa. \u201cTo all the girls that have cheered for me, you have been my inspiration, my encouragement and my strength,\u201d Thompson added in her letter. \u201cOn the days that were tough, and I wanted to give up, your support motivated me to dig deep and keep competing.\u201d \u2018An inspirational player on and off the course\u2019 Tributes poured in from fellow players following Thompson\u2019s announcement, including from world No. 1 and the US Women\u2019s Open tournament favorite Nelly Korda. \u201cShe\u2019s had such an amazing career,\u201d Korda, chasing a seventh win in eight starts, told reporters Tuesday. \u201cI think she does an amazing job for the Tour. She spends so much time going to each Pro-Am party. She really dedicated her time to growing the game. It\u2019s sad to see that she\u2019s obviously leaving and not going to be out here with us anymore, but she\u2019s had an amazing career, and I wish her the best in this new chapter of her life.\u201d Reigning US Women\u2019s Open champion and fellow American Allisen Corpuz added: \u201cShe\u2019s had such a great career. I looked up to her, and I\u2019m not that much younger than her, but I watched her play in multiple U.S. Opens, watched her win a bunch. \u201cShe\u2019s just such an inspirational player both on and off the course. She\u2019s at pretty much every Pro-Am party, always up to do everything. Just to see how she\u2019s impacted the Tour is really special, and I just wish her all the best.\u201d LPGA greats Michelle Wie West and Annika S\u00f6renstam were among those who commented on Thompson\u2019s Instagram video, with 15-time winner Suzann Pettersen writing: \u201cThanks for all the battles, laughs and fairways we\u2019ve shared!

Both were commanding athletes: Catlin, a US track cyclist, was a three-times world champion and Olympic silver medalist, and Soutter, a snowboarder, was tipped to be one of Team Great Britain\u2019s strongest contenders for the 2022 Winter Olympics, having already won a bronze medal at the 2017 European Youth Olympic Festival.  Both were incredibly smart \u2013 Catlin was studying for a master\u2019s degree in computational and mathematical engineering at Stanford University, while Soutter learned to speak French in about six months, according to her father.   At times they almost seemed superhuman. In 2013, after only three weeks of formal training and having broken her wrist, Soutter became British Champion with her arm in a cast. Meanwhile, Catlin, who had a tenderness for children, once rode 80 miles through sleet and snow to speak to a grade school about her Olympic experience.    Yet these two women\u2019s lives were tragically cut short after they sustained serious head injuries in their pursuit of sporting greatness and then took their own lives. Catlin was 23, while Soutter died by suicide on her 18th birthday.  Females may be more susceptible to concussion, and they also have worse and prolonged symptoms after their injury than men, according to a review of 25 studies of sport-related concussion published in the Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine.  However, women remain significantly underrepresented within sport and exercise science research. This, leading experts warn, means they often do not get the treatment or aftercare they need following a head injury.  Women\u2019s sports have historically not received the same attention or funding as men\u2019s sports, Dr. Ann McKee, Director of the Boston University Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s been shown that women athletes are more likely to get a concussion, they tend to have longer recovery periods,\u201d McKee added. \u201cWe do not have enough information about what happens in the female brain. We don\u2019t know if women are biologically more susceptible to these injuries,\u201d she said, adding that some research suggests the size and musculature of women\u2019s necks could play a part. Kelly  Before becoming a track cyclist, Catlin, a triplet, was a national champion road cyclist and time trial national champion, her father Mark, told CNN. After winning a Canadian international race at 17 she was invited to an Olympic training camp for a try out, where, impressed by her performance numbers, coaches immediately offered her a position on the track pursuit team.  Catlin\u2019s father, Mark, told CNN, that his daughter was \u201cintense\u201d and \u201cambitious,\u201d attributes she channeled into her sporting life. Her life changed irrevocably in January 2019. Practicing fast downhill descents in the hills near Los Angeles, she crashed and went skidding down the road.  Despite suffering road rash, Catlin got back on her bike, and finished the ride. It wasn\u2019t her first crash \u2013 she had experienced 4 or 5 hard crashes before this, her father said, and after the latest, she didn\u2019t have any symptoms at the time.  But soon after, at a World Cup track event in Berlin, Catlin was gripped by a sudden and severe headache.   \u201cShe couldn\u2019t compete,\u201d her father said. \u201cKelly is kind of this stoical individual. And if she\u2019s rolling around on the ground, clutching her head, it has to be a severe thing.\u201d On closer inspection, Catlin\u2019s helmet from LA had dents in it. Her father told CNN that this, coupled with her symptoms, caused her family to become aware she had suffered a concussion, which was later confirmed with a diagnosis from Stanford\u2019s Health Centre.  A concussion is a brain injury which happens after a hit to the head or body causes the brain to move back and forth inside the skull, according to the CDC. When Catlin returned to the US, her father says she was examined by the track training center in Colorado. It was confirmed she suffered a concussion, and a return to training protocol was advised, but not implemented or communicated to her coach, he said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any follow-up from Colorado after this. I believe they assumed she would seek care at Stanford,\u201d he told CNN.  CNN has reached out to Stanford and USA Cycling for comment.  Catlin\u2019s symptoms didn\u2019t improve, and in weekly phone calls with her parents, she admitted she was struggling with schoolwork and was unable to concentrate. Stanford Health Center, having diagnosed Catlin with concussion with ongoing symptoms, recommended that she decrease her training for 2 weeks and then gradually build back up and start sessions with an athletic trainer, medical documents sent to CNN by her father show. She was referred to a concussion specialist, the document adds. She tried to train, but \u201cshe would have to stop because she got a severe headache just from walking,\u201d according to her father. Her heart rate would also accelerate rapidly from even the smallest exertion, leaving her with \u201cno exercise tolerance whatsoever,\u201d he added.  Her injury had other consequences. \u201cAs far as we knew she was never a person that suffered from depression. She had an interesting sense of humor.  She was always upbeat and bubbly about things,\u201d her father told CNN.  \u201cShe basically thought her life was over. She was no longer able to be the athlete that she was, she was failing her teammates. And she wasn\u2019t able to succeed in school now. And I think ultimately, that\u2019s why she took her life, because she thought her life was over,\u201d he added.  At the end of January, Catlin made a serious but non-fatal suicide attempt, and was involuntarily admitted to the locked psychiatric ward at Stanford, her father told CNN. A month after that attempt, she took her own life.     Ellie   Soutter\u2019s father Tony said there were many dimensions to his young daughter \u2013 not only was she an \u201cadrenaline junkie,\u201d but she was \u201cvery conscientious\u201d and excelled in school, even after moving from England to France.   Aged 12, Soutter took up snowboarding at school \u2013 and just months later, she was spotted in her hometown resort of Les Gets and trialed by Team Great Britain in February 2013.  \u201cIt was quite obvious why she kept winning competitions because she just made it easy,\u201d her father said. \u201cShe just made it look graceful and beautiful.\u201d But training took its toll \u2013 Soutter told CNN that his daughter suffered seven major concussions in five years, between 2013 and 2018.  \u201cI was being advised by doctors \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, she\u2019s young enough she\u2019ll bounce back. As she progressed, becoming an elite athlete starting on the World Cup circuit, every time she had another concussion, they got worse, and they took longer to recover from,\u201d he told CNN.     \u201cWith every concussion, with the exception of a few minor knocks, Ellie saw a doctor in person,\u201d he added. \u201cI was always told that she was young enough to bounce back to full health after each case and therefore never consulted with the doctors that I met, about any previous concussions.\u201d But Soutter\u2019s final concussion was so \u201chuge\u201d that she spent two nights in the hospital. \u201cWhen I got there, she didn\u2019t even know who I was or where she was,\u201d her father said. Soutter was then selected for the Junior Snowboard World Championships in New Zealand August 2018.  But a month before the competition, she died by suicide.  Her father said a neurologist conducted a CT scan of her brain and reaction tests three months after her final concussion, but said she was \u201cabsolutely fine\u201d and could continue competing.                                                                                                                                 Like Catlin, Soutter had issues with studying and concentrating, becoming more insular as she suffered from crippling headaches. She also started suffering from insomnia.  \u201cShe would literally sit with the tutor a good month after a concussion, and suddenly, she\u2019d go blind. She\u2019d not be able to see \u2013 everything would go black and dark,\u201d her father said. After missing a flight to snowboard training, Soutter died by suicide on her 18th birthday. Team GB referred CNN to GB Snowsport when approached for comment, adding that Ellie only competed for Team GB at one event.  In order to represent Britain in international competitions, GB Snowsport says athletes or their coaches are required to demonstrate that the athlete has reached established performance criteria, is of the relevant technical ability to compete, and has appropriate medical clearance to compete. A large number of athletes can represent Britain at different levels of international competition but are not part of a programme delivered and overseen by GB Snowsport.  \u201cAs Ellie was not part of the GB Snowsport programme, we were unable to implement a personalised recovery and management programme for Ellie,\u201d a spokesperson for GB Snowsport told CNN in an email. \u201cShe was, however, covered by national policies and protocols around fitness to compete, and would not have been cleared for any activity \u2013 training or competition \u2013 overseen by GB Snowsport without being able to demonstrate appropriate medical sign-off,\u201d they added. The spokesperson for GB Snowsport told CNN: \u201cWe take concussions and head injuries incredibly seriously, and in reviewing contemporaneous records from the time that Ellie was involved in snowsport we are confident that GB Snowsport staff applied and followed every appropriate process.\u201d Catlin and Soutter aren\u2019t the only young sporting women whose lives have been cut short in this way. After 29-year-old Australian rules football player Jacinda Barclay took her life in 2020, post-mortem research by scientists found that she had degradation to her cerebral white matter unusual for someone her age.  \u201cFor someone her age, you would expect to see lovely pristine white matter, and hers looked like she was an old woman in that it was basically degraded,\u201d Michael Buckland, founder and Executive Director of the Australian Sports Brain Bank, who studied Barclay\u2019s brain, told CNN.  \u201cWe haven\u2019t gone back and done specific white matter studies on our donors,\u201d he told CNN, adding that the bank hasn\u2019t done peer reviewed research on this.  \u201cBut what struck me, just as someone that sees a lot of brains \u2013 this is not normal for someone of that age.\u201d  Damage to white matter has been associated with dementia, according to research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.   Opportunities missed Suicide after concussion is rare. However patients diagnosed with concussion or mild traumatic brain injury had double the risk of suicide and a higher risk of suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts than people without brain injuries, a 2018 study from researchers at the University of Harvard published in JAMA Neurology found. Dr. Robert Cantu, clinical professor of neurology at the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at Boston University School of Medicine told CNN that there are several theories as to why incidence of suicide is higher in people who have suffered concussion. One theory, he explained, is that those suffering from persistent post-concussion symptoms may have structural or functional brain damage and could be experiencing \u201cbehavioral dysregulation: short fuse, irritability, [and] can\u2019t suppress impulses the way you normally could.\u201d   With these emotional problems, \u201cthey would be more prone to perhaps do something impulsive, like commit suicide,\u201d Cantu, medical director of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, told CNN. A second theory, Cantu noted, is that post-concussive symptoms prevent people from getting back into their sport and stop them \u201cfrom being the person that they were before their injury.\u201d Neither theory is proven to the exclusion of the other, Cantu said, adding he thinks increased suicidality was \u201ca combined factor involving both in many, if not most cases.\u201d There are also differences in the way brain injuries affect women.  A study of female soccer players across US high schools found they are nearly twice as likely to suffer concussion as their male counterparts, according to research that looked at over 80,000 adolescent athletes, published in the journal JAMA Network Open.  Women remain significantly underrepresented within sport and exercise science research: a 2021 study examining papers from some of the most influential sports medical journals found that only 6% of the studies were solely focused on women, compared with 31% of studies that included just men. Other researchers have pointed to female sex hormones, with risk of concussion changing with hormone levels during a menstrual cycle.  McKee said all athletes can also experience \u201cnon-concussive\u201d injuries: \u201chits to the head that can be of the same magnitude as concussion, but they don\u2019t rise to the level of symptoms for whatever reason, so a player tends to play right through it.\u201d Cumulative exposure to repetitive head impacts \u2013 including concussion and non- concussive injuries \u2013 increases the risk for the neurodegenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known as CTE, McKee said.  The disease, which can only be formally diagnosed with an autopsy, has mostly been seen in either veterans or people who played contact sports, particularly American football, say researchers. The disease occurs when the brain starts to degenerate likely due to repeated head traumas, according to the Mayo Clinic, which notes CTE is \u201cassociated with recurrent concussions.\u201d But scientists aren\u2019t only concerned about concussions.  Previous studies have shown subconcussive head impacts \u2013 repetitive hits to the head and body that do not cause symptoms \u2013 can still result in long-term neurological disease.   According to The Concussion Legacy Foundation, \u201cthe best available evidence suggests that subconcussive impacts, not concussions, are the driving force behind CTE.\u201d There have been cases of CTE discovered in athletes who have never been diagnosed with a concussion, according to the Concussion Legacy Foundation. And other changes in the brain after repetitive head impacts aside from CTE are likely \u201cequally important,\u201d McKee said. \u201cWe also see damage to the white matter. And that appears to be mostly in the frontal lobe, but also in the temporal lobes,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to understand the relationship of those white matter changes to behavioral and mood symptoms, perhaps even suicidality,\u201d she said.  McKee stressed that concussion management is important, but physicians and athletes should also be aware of other injuries. \u201cThe problem is the subclinical hits \u2013 the non-concussive injuries that aren\u2019t detected, you don\u2019t pull the player off the field \u2013 and they can be in the hundreds or even the 1000s in a single season,\u201d she explained. Lack of research  Though a growing body of data suggests women in sport are more likely to sustain a concussion, have more severe symptoms, and to take longer to recover, most sports-related concussions protocols are based on data from men.  In a review in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers looked at 171 concussion studies written since 1967 which are used to inform the most influential consensus and position statements in treating sports-related concussions. Clinicians rely on these documents to guide their medical practice when treating athletes \u2013 but most of the studies are focused on men. Only 1% of them was looking exclusively at concussions in women and 40% of them didn\u2019t have any women in a sample of participants at all.   There is another risk factor for women in sport when they sustain head injuries, Katherine Snedaker, founder and executive director of PINK Concussions, a non-profit dedicated to women\u2019s health and brain injury, told CNN.  There is a gulf of millions of dollars separating women and men when it comes to average annual salaries in most professional sports. Outside of elite sport, Snedaker says, female athletes often don\u2019t have access to the same medical care as men, meaning head injuries aren\u2019t spotted as routinely.   \u201cThey tend to push really hard through the injury,\u201d she said. And many women can\u2019t afford to take time out to recover: even professional athletes will supplement their sports income with other jobs, she added, and many are caregivers. \u201cWhen they really crater, it\u2019s a couple of days or weeks later.\u201d  Snedaker said female athletes often weren\u2019t aware they had suffered a head injury. If they were, she said, there were no appropriate medical or sporting staff to inform. Not enough support The families of Catlin and Soutter feel the young women didn\u2019t get enough support after their injuries. After Catlin\u2019s first suicide attempt, she was released from an involuntary admission to the psychiatric ward after threatening legal action, and a conference between psychiatrists, her coach and her parents.  She attended therapy sessions, which she agreed to attend during the conference, but found \u201cthey were geared toward suicidal freshman with a whole set of different issues than an elite Olympic athlete,\u201d her father told CNN. She got a referral to a sports psychologist that worked with the Stanford athletic department, but the department forbade the psychologist from seeing Catlin because she was not a varsity athlete, her father added.  She contacted the office of a sports psychologist with whom she had developed a rapport while in the hospital \u2013 but, his appointment secretary said he had no openings for six months, her father told CNN.  \u201cWherever she turned she could not find help,\u201d he said, adding that his daughter tried a suicide hotline several times: she was once put on hold and once received no answer. Catlin described his daughter as a \u201cstoic, female warrior type person that isn\u2019t going to admit that she\u2019s struggling.\u201d  \u201cShe needed a sports psychiatrist that really could understand what she was going through and understand the rigors of her life in terms of preparation for competitions and the athletic side of it and what it could potentially do to you.\u201d Her father said a major factor in his daughter\u2019s death was \u201ca lack of communication between the facilities that were involved in Kelly\u2019s care. No one was in charge and they assumed the other institutions were following up when they weren\u2019t,\u201d he added. In a statement sent to CNN, Luisa Rapport, director of emergency communications and media relations at Stanford University did not address any of the specific allegations made by Catlin\u2019s family.  She said while the university does not discuss in the media the details of individual students\u2019 experiences, \u201csupporting the mental and emotional health of students is a critical priority for Stanford.\u201d  \u201cStudents in need of mental health crisis assistance \u2013 including students having suicidal thoughts \u2013 and those who are concerned about students in need of assistance, can contact the University\u2019s Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) 24 hours-a-day, seven days-a-week,\u201d she added. Rapport said that in addition to this, \u201cthere are multiple places where psychological services may be provided for students depending on individualized need and treatment recommendations, including, for example, affiliated hospital services and clinics through Stanford\u2019s Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, and mental health programs and clinicians in the community.\u201d In a statement sent to CNN, USA Cycling said it was \u201cdevastated\u201d by Catlin\u2019s death, adding: \u201cShe brought focus and determination to everything she did, and served as an inspiration to everyone who knew her.  \u201cAs the National Governing Body for the sport of cycling, USA Cycling prioritizes the holistic wellbeing of the riders on the U.S. National Team and has a longstanding commitment to providing both physical and mental health resources to members of the team,\u201d a representative for USA Cycling added.   After his daughter Ellie\u2019s death, Soutter was contacted by the UNITE Brain Bank, who wanted to study her brain as part of their research into CTE. But even in that facility \u2013 the biggest of its kind in the world \u2013 of some 1,300 brains, only 3% belonged to women, Ann McKee, Director of the Boston University Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center told CNN. \u201cWhen I actually started looking into CTE \u2013 all of the work that they\u2019ve done with the footballers in America, she had every single symptom and more,\u201d Soutter told CNN. \u201cIt was quite obvious to me that there was a definite link in her starting to get into dark places and feeling bad and anxious and not sleeping properly. All of those symptoms \u2026 Every one that\u2019s involved in CTE was part of Ellie\u2019s life,\u201d he added. \u201cI truly believe today that my daughter would be alive had I had any inkling, you know, even the smallest bit of information.\u201d Editor\u2019s Note: If you are in the US and you or a loved one have contemplated suicide, call The National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255) to connect with a trained counselor.

{"id": "2024_05_10_sport_hattan-alsaif-mma-saudi-arabia-spt-intl", "text": "Hattan Alsaif has grown accustomed to sparring with men. Rarely shy about confronting heavier, stronger opponents, she knows what it\u2019s like to absorb blow after blow until tears begin to shine in her eyes, her face red and hot from crying. As one of the few women at her gym in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia \u2013 and the only woman hopeful of fighting at an elite level \u2013 Alsaif had little choice but to train with and against her male counterparts when she first took up martial arts. She credits her sometimes brutal introduction to the sport as one of the reasons for her success. \u201cI was the only girl doing it day and night, day and night, day and night,\u201d Alsaif told CNN Sport. \u201cI always spar with guys, I train with guys, I\u2019m always with the guys in the gym. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy thing, so when it comes to the cage, when I get a hit from a girl, I feel like, \u2018Whoa, is this all you\u2019ve got?\u2019\u201d The 22-year-old had already made history in MMA, even before her atomweight bout against Egypt\u2019s Nada Faheem on Friday, which she won by knock out in the second round. In January, Alsaif signed a contract with the Professional Fighters League (PFL), making her the first woman from Saudi Arabia to join a global MMA promotion. It was a notable moment in a country known for its socially conservative attitudes, where sporting opportunities have historically been limited for women. The Saudi women\u2019s soccer team only played its first match two years ago, while a domestic soccer league wasn\u2019t established until 2020. Alsaif is acutely aware of her status as a trailblazer for female MMA fighters in Saudi Arabia and takes such a responsibility seriously. \u201cIt\u2019s big, to be honest, because I\u2019m going to be carrying this thing my entire life,\u201d she said, speaking to CNN before her MMA debut fight on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit heavy to carry it, but I\u2019m excited and proud to be the person to do it.\u201d Alsaif endured a difficult upbringing, orphaned at the age of 10 after both of her parents died in a short space of time. She says she battled depression during her teenage years before finding solace in martial arts, helping her to discover a sense of purpose and peace. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a normal childhood or an easy childhood because of the loss of my parents,\u201d said Alsaif. \u201cBut after God, martial arts helped me a lot \u2013 so, so, so much. It changed my life 100% for the better. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m so addicted to martial arts. I don\u2019t want to stop doing [it] because it\u2019s just the thing that makes me feel alive. I feel I\u2019m alive when I train, when I fight, in the gym \u2013 I can feel my soul alive. \u201cWhen I breathe after the rounds, when I feel sick, when I feel tired, when I feel courage, when I feel scared, those moments, every part of that, it makes me feel alive. It\u2019s something that means a lot to me.\u201d Growing up, Alsaif had always loved extreme, adrenaline-fueled sports, and her curiosity to try something new took her to a boxing gym in her local neighborhood. That piqued her interest, but she soon found that the boxing class she was attending lacked rigor and professionalism. Then, after seeing videos of Saudi MMA fighter Abdullah Al-Qahtani on social media, the pair exchanged messages and Alsaif was invited to try the sport for herself. \u201cI started looking at the guys, and they were hitting the bags with kicks and elbows and knees,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI was like, they have more weapons than I do. I only have hands [in boxing]. I felt so jealous \u2026 I love to do the things that have more power.\u201d Alsaif started to compete in Muay Thai \u2013 the stand-up, striking combat sport originating in Thailand \u2013 and went on to win titles at the World Combat Games, the Saudi Games and the International Federation of Muaythai Associations (IFMA) World Championships under the guidance of coach Feras Sadaa. Sadaa, coach of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Muay Thai national team, has been central to Alsaif\u2019s success, though his influence extends far beyond a sporting sphere. \u201cAll these years, I never felt what [having a] father means at all,\u201d said Alsaif. \u201cAnd he was a gift from God. He did everything with me. He helped me in every situation, in the gym or outside of the gym. \u201cHe was like family. He always told anyone else that Hattan is not just my student, Hattan is one of my kids \u2026 I wish to make him so happy [and] represent him in the best way I can.\u201d Friday\u2019s fight card in Riyadh, headlined by Al-Qahtani, was Alsaif\u2019s first chance to assess whether she was able to translate her Muay Thai prowess into success in an MMA cage. The event, part of the PFL\u2019s growing prominence in the region, featured fighters from across the Middle East and North Africa, less than three months since Claressa Shields and Kelsey De Santis contested the first professional female MMA bout in Saudi Arabia. Last year, SURJ Sports Investments Company, which is owned by Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF), acquired a minority stake in the PFL, part of the PFL\u2019s strategy to recruit more fighters and attract more fans in the MENA region. Alsaif never envisioned herself becoming an MMA pioneer when she took her first curious steps into a combat gym, but said that she wants to leave a legacy in the sport. Her upcoming bout is the first step towards achieving that goal and also an opportunity to reflect on all that she has overcome during her short time as an MMA fighter. She does that between rounds in the gym, wiping any tears from her eyes and reminding herself of the effort and energy she has so far devoted to her pursuit. \u201cI start looking at myself in the mirror and I\u2019d be like, \u2018You have killed yourself; you have cried; you have sacrificed everything,\u2019\u201d said Alsaif. \u201c\u2018You are really strong; you are your own role model\u2019 \u2026 It does give me a lot of motivation.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/sport/hattan-alsaif-mma-saudi-arabia-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Today I just couldn\u2019t get the putts to fall,\u201d Scheffler told reporters after his round. \u201cThis golf course can be unpredictable at times, and maybe it got the better of me the last couple days. I\u2019ll sit down and think about where we\u2019re going the last few days and figure it out.\u201d How damaging those two days were to Scheffler\u2019s hopes of a sixth win in nine starts was merely a secondary consideration: at five-over overall, the overwhelming tournament favorite arrived at the clubhouse admitting he did not expect to return for the final 36 holes. By the skin of his teeth, Scheffler avoided missing the weekend at a major for the first time since 2022 as another day of high scoring saw the cut line fall at five-over par, edging through the 27-year-old and a host of other relieved stars. \u2018Maybe the worst golf shot I think I\u2019ve ever seen you hit\u2019 It made for an anxious wait after a morning that brimmed with frustration for the typically unflustered Texan. Having started from the 10th tee, Scheffler tossed his putter into the air in exasperation after his par-saving effort at the 15th hole curled away at the death, resigning him to a first bogey of the day. When his opening drive at the 17th veered left, Scheffler muttered to himself in the second person: \u201cMaybe the worst golf shot I think I\u2019ve ever seen you hit.\u201d After a repeat outcome at the subsequent tee box, he slammed his driver on the ground before picking up his tee and throwing it. Despite those errors, the reigning Masters champion generally drove well throughout but struggled on and around the greens, his woes peaking during a disastrous double bogey at the par-five fifth hole. His third shot was an attempted chip onto the green from the native area that gained him mere inches, as his ball caught a slope and rolled back to his feet. Scheffler\u2019s subsequent effort left him even further away from the hole, skipping past the flag and over the other side of the green. There were still a few grains of salt left to rub into the wound, as Scheffler\u2019s putt to escape with a bogey came up four inches short. Incredibly, playing partner and last month\u2019s PGA Championship victor Xander Schauffele endured an almost identical series of unfortunate events for a double bogey of his own, his ball rolling back to him before skidding well past the cup on the next attempt. The world No. 2 put his own frustrations into words candidly after returning to the clubhouse. \u201cThat pissed me off,\u201d Schauffele, who shot one-under 69 to climb into a share of ninth at one-under overall, told reporters. Aberg nudges ahead Though Schauffele remains within striking distance, Scheffler finds himself 10 shots behind Sweden\u2019s Ludvig Aberg, who tops the leaderboard by a stroke at five-under par overall after shooting 69. The 24-year-old has enjoyed a meteoric rise and continues to impress in his first ever US Open appearance and just his third career major outing, having finished second on his Masters debut in April. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that I\u2019m thinking about all the time, but sometimes I have to stop for a little bit and think about how fortunate I am to be able to do this at this level,\u201d world No. 6 Aberg told reporters. \u201cTo be able to play these tournaments, to be able to play with the guys that I\u2019ve watched on TV for such a long time is definitely a pinch-me moment.\u201d Belgium\u2019s Thomas Detry, as well as American duo Bryson DeChambeau and Patrick Cantlay, lead the chasing pack, with Rory McIlroy \u2013 bidding to end a 10-year wait for his fifth major crown \u2013 a stroke behind the trio. Woods uncertain on open future A host of big names fell foul of the cut line, including two of the world\u2019s top-10. Viktor Hovland and Max Homa narrowly missed out at six-over overall, while three-time champion Tiger Woods finished one shot behind the duo. Woods had been competing on a special exemption after failing to qualify for a major for the first time in his professional career, but the 48-year-old showed flashes of his old brilliance as he shot 74 and 73. The 15-time major champion made it to the weekend at the Masters in April but has now missed the cut at successive majors after falling away at the PGA Championship last month. He is eligible to play at next month\u2019s Open Championship in Scotland due to his status as a previous winner yet when asked by CNN\u2019s Patrick Snell if he might have played his last US Open, Woods cast doubt on his future at both open tournaments. \u201cAs far as my last Open Championship or US Open Championship, I don\u2019t know what that is. It may or may not be,\u201d Woods told Snell. \u201cMy ball-striking and felt like my putting was good enough to be in contention and I\u2019m not,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating because I\u2019m not here to have a chance to win on the weekend.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/sport/scottie-scheffler-ludvig-aberg-us-open-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "sports"}}

It seemed not just unlikely but almost impossible, a pipedream that had a 0.02% chance of coming true, according to stats website data golf, requiring some perfect mixture of luck and skill to produce a miraculous shot on his last hole under the most intense pressure. But Molinari took out his seven-iron on the 194-yard par-three ninth, and his shot landed on the edge of the green before rolling all the way into the hole as he staggered to the side and dropped his shoulders in disbelief. \u201cWhat are the chances, really? I don\u2019t even know what to say,\u201d the 41-year-old Italian told reporters afterward. \u201cJust incredible.\u201d After his hole-in-one, Molinari finished on five-over-par at Pinehurst No. 2 in North Carolina, sneaking inside the cut at the last opportunity. And the 2018 Open Championship winner admitted that he had thought almost all hope of staying in the tournament was lost when he bogeyed the eighth leaving himself with two shots to make up on the last hole. \u201cI just bogeyed eight,\u201d he said. \u201cI was hoping I was able to par eight and then having to make two at nine. With that flag, if you hit a good shot, you can get it within birdie range, but when I dropped a shot at eight \u2026 Standing on the ninth tee it was just put a good swing on it and see what happens.\u201d His playing partners Min Woo Lee and Sergio Garcia celebrated with him as he made the cut for only the second time from eight tournaments on the PGA Tour this year. \u201cSergio was walking in front of me and he raised his hands when the ball was still five meters from the hole and I wanted to tell him, \u2018Come on, don\u2019t jinx me,\u2019\u201d Molinari told Sky Sports. \u201cI haven\u2019t been making a lot of cuts in the last few weeks, I\u2019ve been there or thereabouts and just falling short so it\u2019s nice to see one going my way. Hopefully the first of a few,\u201d he added. The ninth hole proved lucky for Austria\u2019s Sepp Straka too as he made his first ace on the PGA Tour earlier that day, and also made the cut at two over. Molinari teed off for the third round at 8:55 a.m. ET on Saturday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/sport/francesco-molinari-hole-in-one-us-open-cut-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_sport_north-korea-soccer-team-inside-spt-intl", "text": "What happens within North Korea\u2019s soccer team has been kept a closely guarded secret since its creation at the end of World War II. Millions around the world caught a glimpse of the North Korean men\u2019s team in two World Cups. The Cheollima \u2013 a mythical winged horse found in East Asian mythology and featured prominently in North Korean society \u2013 beat Italy 1-0 in a stunning performance in Middlesbrough, England, in 1966. However, the team\u2019s appearance at the 2010 tournament in South Africa was far less successful, as the team lost all three of its matches, including a 7-0 shellacking by Portugal. But much like the reclusive nation itself, the team in recent years has fallen back into the shadows. Now in an exclusive interview with CNN Sport, retired North Korean midfielder An Yong Hak, who lives in Japan, has revealed what it\u2019s like to play for the team. The secrecy surrounding the North Korean national team was also evident in the case of star player Han Kwang Song. At his peak, Han was on the roster of Italian giant Juventus and featured in its U-23 side, but then he vanished from the public eye for more than three years. He had been last spotted lifting a trophy with his most recent team, Qatari club Al-Duhail, in 2020 as UN Security Council resolutions later forced the repatriation of all North Korean workers abroad. But that rapid change of fortune \u2013 from playing in top divisions in Italy and Qatar to being stuck at an embassy for the better part of three years \u2013 did not cause the striker to consider quitting soccer. Almost out of nowhere, Han publicly reappeared last November with North Korea for its World Cup qualifiers, scoring a header in a 6-1 drubbing of Myanmar. Retired North Korean midfielder An, who is now 45, laments Han being stuck in diplomatic limbo, saying it was unfortunate that the striker was unable to join Pyongyang\u2019s leading domestic club team \u2013 4.25 SC, or April 25 SC \u2013 sooner \u201cto develop at an age when he could have advanced more.\u201d \u201cHe was stuck in an embassy in China, and he had to train alone for about two to three years. Last September, I think, they let him into the country,\u201d An told CNN Sport, citing a North Korean official he spoke with. Born in Japan with a North Korean passport, An represented North Korea on the pitch for 10 years, a national team career which Han told An he enjoyed witnessing, according to the retired international midfielder. An recalled meeting Han for the first time in 2019 in Pyongyang, where he watched the former Cagliari striker play against South Korea, captained by Tottenham Hotspur star Son Heung-min, in a qualifier for the 2022 Qatar World Cup. After that match, An said he was waiting to fly back home to Japan and coincidentally ran into Han and two other North Korean players \u2013 Pak Kwang Ryong and Choe Song Hyok \u2013 who were playing in Austria and Italy respectively at the time. \u201c[Han] told me that he had been watching me at the stadium when I played on the national team,\u201d An said of his first interaction with the striker. An recalled telling Han and the young North Korea players, \u201cYou guys have to do well from now on, and I\u2019ll also go to Italy to cheer you guys on.\u2019\u201d \u201cYes, please come! I\u2019ll come pick you up,\u201d Han replied to An. Then in March this year \u2013 five years and one pandemic later \u2013 the two met again, this time in Tokyo, Japan. \u201cI went to the hotel [the team was staying at] a day after the game, and I told him, \u2018It\u2019s been a long time,\u2019\u201d An said. The pair talked about the previous day\u2019s 2026 World Cup qualifying match where North Korea had lost to Japan by one goal. \u201cHan\u2019s shot had hit the post and it didn\u2019t go in, so we talked about how close he was [to scoring],\u201d said An. \u201cBecause of the sanctions, Han said, \u2018I\u2019m playing in [North Korea],\u2019\u201d said An, adding that there was not much time to get into deeper conversation. He referred to Han as \u201cthe kind of talent that comes around every 10 or 20 years\u201d and as someone who had the potential to become \u201ca world-class player.\u201d \u201cI want him to be a symbol of the DPRK [North Korea] national team\u2026 I would like to see him become a player like Son Heung-min or someone of that caliber,\u201d An said of the 25-year-old Han. \u2018A hoax\u2019 Although North Korea has long isolated itself from the rest of the world, it has frequently participated in international sporting competitions, with the notable exception of during the Covid-19 pandemic. When the Cheollima ended its 2010 World Cup run \u2013 losing every group stage match, against Brazil, Portugal and Ivory Coast \u2013 rumors and reports arose that the players and coaches were subjected to punishments back in Pyongyang. Citing anonymous sources, Radio Free Asia reported that coach Kim Jong Hun was sent to do forced labor, while the players were subjected to \u201charsh ideological criticism,\u201d except An and another North Korean-Japanese striker, Jong Tae Se. CNN could not independently verify this report. An called such reports \u201ca hoax.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard to get information about DPRK, so there are still stories about people being sent to a coal mine after losing a match or being lectured for six hours, but there are no such stories at all, as far as I know,\u201d An said, denying rumors about the isolated country, citing his 10-year career of playing for the national team. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to put an end to that kind of false information,\u201d he said. Earning a spot at the 2010 World Cup marked only the second time North Korea had qualified for the world\u2019s marquee soccer competition since 1966, when the Cheollima made it to the quarterfinals, losing to Portugal 5-3. When North Korea secured its ticket to South Africa, the squad\u2019s players were acknowledged by the regime with a certificate and an apartment in Pyongyang, a rare but well-known practice by the Kim regime to reward loyalty, according to state media KCNA and verified by An. \u201cEveryone received a certificate, and we each received an apartment in Pyongyang,\u201d An said, adding that he did not get one because he is \u201cZainichi Korean.\u201d Koreans who migrated or were forced to move to Japan under colonial rule before the peninsula was divided in half are known in Japanese as \u201cZainichi Korean,\u201d including their descendants. They are eligible to apply for a North Korean passport or acquire South Korean nationality as they are not given Japanese citizenship \u2013 they are, however, legal residents in Japan and can gain citizenship through naturalization. A third generation Zainichi Korean, An holds his North Korean nationality with pride. \u201cMy grandparents kept their DPRK identity, although they could have chosen to live an easy life, so I didn\u2019t want to easily change that identity of mine,\u201d An explained, adding that he also considered South Korea his geographical home. Another Zainichi Korean on the 2010 squad was Jong Tae Se, who grabbed the world\u2019s attention as he broke down in tears during North Korea\u2019s national anthem ahead of the squad\u2019s 2-1 loss to Brazil. Jong\u2019s tears moved the fans and even An said, \u201cMany Zainichi Koreans were extremely moved by it.\u201d \u201cThis Zainichi Korean, born and raised in Japan, had a big dream and made it come true. I was able to stand side-by-side with the athletes from my home country and sing the national anthem,\u201d said An. Earning respect When An joined the North Korean national team upon receiving a call-up letter in 2002, he remembers not being immediately accepted by teammates. \u201cThe players, coaches and managers didn\u2019t know us very well. We needed to be accepted. We weren\u2019t exactly welcomed from the beginning,\u201d the retired midfielder said. North Korean players have strong bonds, as the majority of them \u2013 except for those like Han who used to play abroad and Zainichi Koreans \u2013 reside in the country, and therefore, can be called up for the national team at almost any time, according to An. To be accepted by the squad, newcomer An had to prove himself to the other North Korean players. \u201cI had to compete with the players in daily practice to win their trust and gain recognition. However, practice alone was not enough,\u201d he said. \u201cI scored two goals in a World Cup qualifying match and, by producing a result, I was accepted as a member of the national team,\u201d An said, referring to his brace in a 4-1 win against Thailand in the 2006 World Cup qualifiers. It was then that the team welcomed An wholeheartedly and the squad members became \u201clike a family\u201d to him, he said. \u201cUsually, we\u2019re apart, as I\u2019m in Japan and they are in DPRK\u2026 it is difficult to keep in touch,\u201d he said, reflecting on the unfortunate reality where he cannot even message his friends in Pyongyang. Although, as fate would have it, An met his former teammate and current manager of the North Korean national team, Sin Yong Nam, last March. Sin asked An to visit Pyongyang to share his soccer experience with young, promising talent. \u201cWhen we met again after a long time, I felt nostalgic,\u201d said An as he reflected on meeting his compatriots and former teammates after almost five years. \u201cIf another opportunity arises, I would like to return to Pyongyang and, hopefully, provide some assistance to the national team,\u201d An added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/sport/north-korea-soccer-team-inside-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_sport_jerry-west-obit-nba-logo-spt-intl", "text": "You can\u2019t tell the story of the modern NBA without legendary Los Angeles Lakers player and executive Jerry West, who has passed away at the age of 86. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with West\u2019s influence on the NBA landscape, consider this \u2013 West\u2019s\u00a0most\u00a0recognizable\u00a0nickname is \u201cThe Logo\u201d because his iconic silhouette was literally the inspiration for the league\u2019s famous logo. In an NBA career that spanned over\u00a060\u00a0years, West\u00a0had a hand in\u00a0nine NBA championships,\u00a0first\u00a0as a player with the Lakers and\u00a0then as\u00a0an executive for the\u00a0Purple and Gold\u00a0and the Golden State Warriors. West was key in boosting the profile of the Lakers franchise as it relocated from Minneapolis to Los Angeles where the team reached lofty new heights. As a player, West won just one NBA title, but helped establish the Lakers as the Western Conference\u2019s premiere franchise. After his playing days ended, West was instrumental in constructing the \u201cShowtime\u201d Lakers\u00a0\u2013 highlighted by Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, James Worthy and Michael Cooper\u00a0\u2013\u00a0that won five NBA titles in the 1980s. Humble beginnings West was born May 28, 1938, in the small West Virginia town of Chelyan. As a basketball player at East Bank High School in 1956, West was a\u00a0high school\u00a0All-American,\u00a0West\u00a0Virginia\u2019s\u00a0player of the year and led the team to a state championship. After high school, West stayed in his home state to play basketball for West Virginia University. He was named an All-American in 1959 and 1960 and took the Mountaineers to the 1959 Final Four, where he was named the Most Outstanding Player despite his team losing the championship game. In April 1960, West was drafted by the Lakers, who were in the midst of relocating from Minneapolis to Los Angeles to be the NBA\u2019s first team on the West Coast. Before joining the Lakers, West was a member of the USA\u2019s 1960 gold\u00a0medal-winning\u00a0team in the Olympic Games in Rome, Italy.\u00a0 In\u00a02010, as that Olympic team was inducted into the Naismith\u00a0Memorial\u00a0Basketball Hall of Fame, West said,\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s\u00a0never been a greater thrill in my life than to win a gold medal for our basketball team.\u201d West played 14 NBA seasons as a guard for the Lakers, where he was named an All-Star every season of his career. The Lakers made nine trips to the NBA Finals during his career, but only won a single championship in 1972 against the New York Knicks. West\u2019s Lakers were haunted by the Boston Celtics, who defeated\u00a0their Californian rivals\u00a0six times in the Finals in the 1960s. After yet another loss to Boston in 1969, West was named NBA Finals MVP, the only time a player from the losing team has ever won that award. In 2017, West said in an interview that he hadn\u2019t returned to the city of Boston since his playing career ended and that he was still \u201ctormented\u201d by those losses. How West became \u201cThe Logo\u201d In 1969,\u00a0the NBA commissioned a new logo for the league from designer Alan Siegel, who had famously overseen the design of Major League Baseball\u2019s logo. Siegel, a fan of West, found his inspiration in a photograph of the NBA star\u2019s perfect dribbling form. \u201cIt\u2019s the easiest job I ever had,\u201d Siegel told CNN\u00a0Sport. Siegel has no problem admitting that the NBA logo is based on West, but it\u2019s a different story when it comes to the NBA itself. The league has never formally acknowledged that the logo depicts West. In the NBA\u2019s defense, Siegel says\u00a0that he never told anyone at the league that the logo was modeled after West and never intended for it to be recognizable as the Lakers star. West retired from the NBA in 1974 and was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame\u00a0as a player\u00a0in 1980. Trophy-laden executive career After West stepped off the court, he transitioned into the Lakers\u2019 front office, where his eye for basketball talent proved as prodigious as his own on-court skill. He assembled the \u201cShowtime\u201d Lakers team that dominated the 1980s led by point guard Magic Johnson. The Lakers made eight Finals appearances and won five championships in that decade, including two against West\u2019s longtime nemesis, the Celtics. In the 1996 NBA offseason, West traded for the rights to rookie Kobe Bryant and acquired free agent Shaquille O\u2019Neal in the span of a single month. This laid the foundation for another dominant Lakers dynasty that won three consecutive NBA championships from 2000 through 2002. After seeing the culmination of his efforts, West retired as executive vice president of the Lakers after the 2000 championship. But West was unable to remain away from the game that had been the focal point of his life for nearly 50 years. In 2002, he joined the front office of the Memphis Grizzlies and went on to win the NBA\u2019s executive of the year award in 2004. Following another brief retirement after leaving the Grizzlies in 2007, West joined the Golden State Warriors in 2011 as an executive and oversaw the team\u2019s NBA titles in 2015 and 2017. He then joined the Los Angeles Clippers as an executive in 2017. It was the\u00a0Clippers that announced West had passed away on Wednesday morning with his wife Karen by his side. In 2019, West was honored for his life\u2019s achievements when he was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by\u00a0then\u00a0President Donald Trump. The Presidential Medal of Freedom is the highest civilian award in the United States. West was married twice and has 5 children, all sons. One of his sons, Ryan, worked in the Lakers\u2019 front office for 10 years before leaving to join his father with the Los Angeles Clippers. Another of his children, Jonnie, is director of basketball operations for the Golden State Warriors and is married to\u00a0former\u00a0professional golfer Michelle Wie West.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/sport/jerry-west-obit-nba-logo-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "sports"}}

However,\u00a0ahead of Paris 2024, Nakamura finds herself at the\u00a0center\u00a0of France\u2019s culture wars. Amid widespread\u00a0rumors\u00a0the singer would\u00a0perform at the Games\u2019 Opening Ceremony, singing an Edith Piaf song,\u00a0some members of France\u2019s far-right have questioned\u00a0whether she embodies French heritage, values and identity.\u00a0Piaf is a key figure in France\u2019s musical \u2013 and national \u2013 identity. \u201cThere\u2019s no way Aya. This is Paris, not the market\u00a0in\u00a0Bamako,\u201d said fringe\u00a0and extreme\u00a0far-right group Les Natifs (Natives) on X, formerly known\u00a0as Twitter, in March, referring to Mali\u2019s capital. Nakamura has defended herself on social media, saying on X: \u201cI\u2019m becoming the number one state subject in debates\u00a0\u2026but what do I really owe you all? Nothing.\u201d The singer has received support from Rachida Dati, France\u2019s Minister of Culture, who spoke out in defence of Nakamura, saying \u201cbe careful of the pretext of attacking someone out of pure racism.\u201d Paris 2024\u2019s organizing committee told CNN: \u201cWe were very shocked by the racist attacks against Aya Nakamura in recent days. We offer our full support to the most listened-to French artist in the world.\u201d Whether Nakamura will perform at the Olympics\u2019 opening ceremony is still unconfirmed, with the Paris 2024 organizing committee telling CNN that they\u00a0\u201cwon\u2019t be confirming or denying\u201d\u00a0any rumors or reports, to \u201cleave room for surprises\u201d on the day. CNN has reached out to Nakamura but she declined to\u00a0be interviewed\u00a0on the matter. \u2018She contributes to French culture\u2019 However, many others in France are all too keen to comment on this cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. Far-right politician Marion Mar\u00e9chal,\u00a0who is the niece\u00a0of far-right National Rally party leader\u00a0Marine Le Pen and a member of the\u00a0Reconqu\u00eate\u00a0party, told French\u00a0television stations BMFTV and Europe 1\u00a0that Nakamura\u00a0\u201cdoes not sing in French,\u201d referencing the blend of Parisian and African\u00a0derived slang\u00a0that often feature in her lyrics. \u201cI think that the people who criticize her actually don\u2019t accept that she embodies France,\u201d\u00a0French activist Rokhaya Diallo told CNN. \u201cThe\u00a0slang she uses is used by young people and a lot of young French people use slang.\u201d Nakamura often uses a mix of verlan and African derived slang from languages such as Bambara, from her birth country Mali,\u00a0in her music. Her number one hit song\u00a0\u201cDjadja,\u201d\u00a0contains the lyric \u201cle monde est tit-pe\u201d \u2013 the world is small \u2013 with word \u2018tit-pe\u2019 inverting the French word \u2018petit.\u2019 Verlan, a type of French slang named after\u00a0the inversion of the French word \u2018l\u2019envers\u2019 \u2013 meaning backwards \u2013 originates from the outskirts of Paris known as \u2018la cit\u00e9\u2019 (the suburbs)\u00a0that have had\u00a0large\u00a0immigrant population. At the inauguration of the\u00a0Olympic Aquatics Centre\u00a0earlier this month, French President Emanuel Macron\u00a0said that Nakamura \u201cspeaks to a good number of our compatriots\u201d and claimed that \u201cthese\u00a0games and ceremonies should reflect us, and she contributes to French culture, to French music.\u201d \u201cI want to defend here these choices and defend the fact that there must be artistic freedom and that politics should not interfere,\u201d added Macron. In an interview with France Inter,\u00a0Macron\u2019s political rival Le Pen, known for her right-wing views, claimed that the President was seeking to \u201coutrage\u201d and \u201chumiliate the French people\u201d when asked whether she thinks Nakamura opening the games would be a\u00a0good symbol. When asked to further explain why this choice would be a humiliation, Le Pen responded \u201cshe does not sing in French, or a foreign language, she sings nonsense.\u201d Speaking to CNN, Professor of Political Science at the University of Nice,\u00a0Vincent\u00a0Martigny, said that\u00a0while\u00a0there are those who believe it is right to promote minorities and their role in French culture, there are others, who hold more traditional views, which he terms as racist in relation to the country\u2019s colonial past. 1998 World Cup There have been moments of\u00a0perceived\u00a0unity in France\u2019s past, notably when the men\u2019s national soccer team won the 1998 World Cup. That triumph helped popularise the slogan \u201cBlack, Blanc, Beur\u201d \u2013 Black, White, Arab\u00a0\u00a0\u2013\u00a0amid a push for unity and inclusion. Beur\u2019 is verlan for the French word \u2018arabe.\u2019 France\u2019s World Cup winning team of 1998\u00a0was made up of a\u00a0diverse\u00a0group\u00a0of players,\u00a0not only of European descent but also from the ex-colonies of France\u00a0and other countries.\u00a0Many thought\u00a0at the time\u00a0that the 1998 team was a sign of a truly integrated, multi-cultural France. But notable social and cultural divisions have emerged in France in recent years. There have been\u00a0multiple bans and restrictions against Islamic dress. The nationwide ban on\u00a0public\u00a0schoolchildren wearing abayas,\u00a0was\u00a0denounced as an \u201cIslamophobic campaign\u201d by\u00a0one\u00a0politician\u00a0on the left.\u00a0Athletes have been banned\u00a0from wearing a hijab while competing representing France\u00a0at the Paris\u00a0Olympic Games. Then there have been multiple protests and riots over police brutality leading to the death of\u00a0some French inhabitants of North and West African heritage\u00a0from the suburbs of Paris, fueling backlash over policing methods in marginalized communities. Nakamura\u2019s\u00a0birth\u00a0country\u00a0of Mali is one of the many\u00a0former\u00a0French colonies. There are millions of French citizens, like Nakamura, who are either themselves immigrants or descendants of immigrants from\u00a0nations formerly colonized by France. These days France\u00a0finds itself embroiled in a very public debate over the recognition and acceptance of its immigrants as the country continues to reckon with its colonial history. Professor Martigny believes that the\u00a0nationalist\u00a0party is \u201cstronger than ever\u201d and that nationalists in France are \u201cmore nationalist\u201d and more open with their views today than they were in the past. Activist Diallo also believes that France is struggling to see itself \u201cas it is\u201d and recognize non-White individuals as fully French. \u201cDespite her successes, despite her undeniable achievements, we still think that it\u2019s not an honor for us to have such a woman represent us,\u201d Diallo told CNN, referring to Nakamura. \u2018The Great Replacement\u2019 theory Political scientist Oliver Roy, who is Professor\u00a0at the EUI School of Transnational Governance, told CNN that a common belief that could be fuelling the culture wars in France is an ideology\u00a0expressed\u00a0\u201cnot just [by] the extreme right, but also part of the traditional centre right\u201d known as \u201cthe great replacement.\u201d He describes\u00a0the term\u00a0as \u201cthe idea that there is a new population coming from the south, which is replacing the old traditional, French population.\u201d However, he maintains that this fear \u201cis not supported by demography, [or] by statistics, and is, of course, very ideological.\u201d According to Martigny, France\u2019s cultural divisions are amplified on social media by both extremes of the political spectrum. \u201cBecause of the social networks, public debates are more violent on these issues than they used to be,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a theatre for the expression of extremely strong minded, sometimes racist, very often offensive comments on Twitter, on X, and on other social networks,\u201d added Martigny. \u201cYou have a lot of X accounts who are really, really, really pro far-right. And so they played a role in discussing these issues and making it a controversy. And then this controversy is exported to the traditional media.\u201d \u2018Show a very optimistic face for France\u2019 As Nakamura was targeted by fringe and extreme far-right groups as well as far-right politicians, in an interview\u00a0with BMFTV and RMC,\u00a0Macron said that \u201cthe reactions shocked me \u2026 there\u00a0were\u00a0truly racist reactions.\u201d However,\u00a0Martigny says he sees\u00a0Macron\u2019s condemnation of the attacks as racist as an attempt to balance the scales after the passing of\u00a0what the professor called\u00a0a \u201cvery restrictive law on immigration\u201d a few months ago. In December, Macron passed a controversial bill calling for tougher immigration that was endorsed by the far-right, and rejected by many in his own camp. Politicians such as Le Pen hailed the legislation as an \u201cideological victory\u201d whilst French health Minister, Aurelien Rousseau resigned in protest.\u00a0It included many amendments tightening immigration laws, one of which dictated children born to foreign parents on French soil would no longer become automatic French citizens but would have to apply for citizenship. \u201cHe needs to make that forgotten in a certain way by showing that he has a sense of balance on these issues,\u201d\u00a0Martigny states. By promoting Nakamura, Martigny believes that Macron\u2019s ambitions may have been to \u201cshow a very optimistic face for France.\u201d \u201c[There are] very strong cultural wars in France revolving around pop stars, and the type of pop stars that you can mobilize or the type of artists that you can mobilize when you want to unite the country.\u201d With less than 100 days to go until the Olympics, many hope Paris 2024 will give France the opportunity to show unity. However, the heated reactions to Nakamura hints at a more pessimistic outlook.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/26/sport/aya-nakamura-france-culture-wars-paris-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "sports"}}

There was no Tiger Woods teeing off on Saturday, which perhaps doesn\u2019t come as a great surprise these days, after he missed the cut \u2013 but others failed on the fast and firm greens too, such as Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson, Justin Thomas, Viktor Hovland, Justin Rose, Rickie Fowler, Webb Simpson and Jason Day, to name a few. Major winners, all-time greats and two of the world\u2019s top 10 struggled on the North Carolina course on the first and second day. Even world No.1 Scottie Scheffler \u2013 a man who had made at least one birdie in his last 168 rounds \u2013 toiled, though at five-over overall he did just make the cut. The most recognizable name on the list of absentees this weekend is Woods, though it has been a number of years since the 48-year-old was a contender at majors. He shot 74 and 73 to finish seven-over overall. The 15-time major champion made it to the weekend at the Masters but has now missed the cut at successive majors after falling away at the PGA Championship last month. When asked by CNN\u2019s Patrick Snell if he might have played his last US Open, Woods cast doubt on his future at the tournament and also at the Open Championship in the UK. World No.5 Hovland missed the cut by a shot with his six-over overall, while world No.10 Homa also saw his championship end early. According to the US Open, some players are drawing \u2018X\u2019 on their yardage book on the holes they should not miss the green, given how difficult some are playing. Former world No.1 and two-time major winner Thomas was 11-over overall, but even further behind him on the leaderboard was Mickelson on 15-over overall. Australian Day, a former world No.1, seemed comfortably on course to play beyond the halfway stage, but a dreadful final nine in his second round, where he shot a 41 \u2013 carding five bogeys and double bogey in his second round - saw him drop to eight over. Fowler also started steadily on Thursday, but his game unravelled on Friday as he ended the day seven over, missing the cut by three shots.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/sport/us-open-stars-miss-cut-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/16/2024", "section": "sports"}}

The runner was not identified in the statement and organizers said first responders provided aid while awaiting transport. \u201cIn such circumstances, we have decided to cancel the rest of the event,\u201d the statement added. CNN has reached out to the organization for further comment. The incident involved four runners who fell off a trail due to a slippery track, the local prosecutor told CNN affiliate BFMTV on Saturday. The four runners fell \u201cin a mountainous area made slippery by the weather,\u201d Bonneville public prosecutor Karline Bouisset told BFMTV. One of the four people included a man in his 50\u2019s who died at the scene and was believed to have passed away due to a cardiorespiratory arrest, Bouisset told BFMTV, adding that the exact cause of death would be determined by an autopsy. Among those who fell, two men were severely injured but were in stable condition, according to Bouisset. The fourth person involved was a woman who suffered a less severe injury. The three injured runners had all been transported to a hospital, according to Bouisset. The prosecutor\u2019s office had launched an investigation into the incident, she told BFMTV. The three-day run takes place in the\u00a0eastern\u00a0French department of\u00a0Haute\u00a0Savoie, in the French\u00a0Alps, and was set to run from June 14 to 16.
