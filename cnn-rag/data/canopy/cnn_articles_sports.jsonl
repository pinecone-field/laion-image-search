After coming second in the 200m breaststroke final in Indianapolis on Thursday, the double Olympic gold medallist was greeted by boyfriend James Wells on the pool deck. After telling her that he didn\u2019t regret \u201cmoving halfway across the country\u201d to be with her, he then got down on one knee to pop the question. \u201cOh my god,\u201d King said as Wells went down on one knee, before exclaiming \u201cYes, yes!\u201d Wells told NBC that having the trials in King\u2019s home state had provided the \u201cperfect opportunity\u201d for a proposal. \u201cIt means so much for her to be here in front of this crowd,\u201d he added. King had already qualified for her third Summer Games by winning the 100m breaststroke final on Monday. After winning gold in the women\u2019s 100m breaststroke at Rio 2016, King was part of the US team to claim gold in the women\u2019s 4x100m medley relay at the same Games. She won the 100m breaststroke world title in world record time a year later at the 2019 World Championships, and helped the US break the 4x100m medley relay world record. At the Tokyo Olympics, she won bronze medals in both the 100m and 200m breaststroke.

The Celtics beat the Dallas Mavericks\u00a0106-88\u00a0in Game 5 of the NBA Finals in Boston on Monday night to win the series 4-1 and secure their league-record 18th title. Celtics star Tatum had a\u00a0game-high 31 points, along with 11 assists and eight rebounds, while fellow standout Brown added 21 points, eight rebounds and six assists. \u201cIt\u2019s a surreal feeling. We did it! We did it!\u201d Tatum shouted on the ABC broadcast after the game. \u201cThis is an incredible feeling. I\u2019m lost for words.\u201d Brown was named the NBA Finals MVP after averaging 20.8 points, 5.4 rebounds and five assists per game in the series. After accepting the Bill Russell Trophy in front of this home fans, Brown attributed part of his success to Tatum, who also made a case to win MVP. \u201cIt was a full team effort and I share this with my brothers and my partner in crime, Jayson Tatum. He was with me the whole way,\u201d Brown said.  This is the Celtics\u2019 first championship since 2008, and it moves Boston past the Lakers franchise (17 won in Minneapolis and Los Angeles) to sit alone atop the list of clubs with the most titles in NBA history. The Mavericks had been trying to become the first team in NBA history to recover from an 0-3 deficit to win a playoff series. They avoided a sweep by beating the Celtics 122-84 in Game 4 in Dallas on Friday \u2013 but that just set the stage for the Celtics to win the title on their home floor. A half-court shot put an exclamation point on Boston\u2019s dominant first half In the first quarter, Boston played controlled basketball, while the Mavericks started off cold, making only one of their first nine field goal attempts. Just as Dallas found its rhythm to get back within one point, Boston erupted with a 9-0 run to close out the quarter with a 28-18 lead. The Celtics kept the pressure on in the second quarter, stretching their lead to as many as 21 points. At the center of Boston\u2019s impressive performance was the Celtics\u2019 formidable Tatum and Brown, who combined for 31 points in the first half. Boston put an exclamation point on the dominant first half with a half-court buzzer beater from Payton Pritchard to send the crowd at TD Garden into a frenzy. The shot gave the Celtics their biggest lead of the half at 67-46. In the second half, Boston never relented, leading by as many as 26 points. Every time the Mavericks saw a glimmer of hope, the Celtics would quickly respond. For the Mavericks, star guard Luka Don\u010di\u0107 \u2013 who finished third in season MVP voting \u2013 had 28 points and 12 rebounds Monday, while Kyrie Irving added 15 points, on 5-of-16 shooting, and nine assists. Celtics guard Jrue Holiday had 15 points and 11 rebounds, while playing relentless defense to hold the Mavericks stars in check. After finishing the season with the NBA\u2019s best record at 64-18, the Celtics\u2019 domination continued into the playoffs, highlighted by a franchise-record 10-game postseason win streak. In the first round, the Celtics dispatched the Miami Heat 4-1, avenging their loss in a rematch of the 2023 Eastern Conference Finals. Boston then routed the Cleveland Cavaliers 4-1, securing their third consecutive conference finals appearance, a feat last achieved during their five-year run between 1984-1988. The road to the Finals is generally supposed to become increasingly difficult as teams advance further into the playoffs. For Boston, however, that did not seem to be the case. The Celtics swept the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals and needed five games to close out the Mavericks in the Finals. After losing in the Finals to the Golden State Warriors in 2022 and being upset in the Eastern Conference Finals by the Miami Heat last year, the Celtics made a couple of big swings last offseason to construct a fearsome five-man unit. Multiple-time All-Stars Holiday and Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is (formerly a Maverick) were acquired via trade, with the latter\u2019s recent return from injury proving to be a big boost for Boston. The pair are accompanied by overqualified role-player Derrick White, but it was Tatum and Brown who were the true difference makers. Tatum told the ABC broadcast following the championship win that the Celtics stayed focused despite mounting pressure going into Game 5. \u201cWe have a resilient group, we\u2019ve been through a lot as a team over these last couple of years, over my seven years. What they going to say now?\u201d Tatum said. This story has been updated with additional information.

The 30-year-old US golfer might be holding a one-shot lead atop the leaderboard at the US Open, but he gives a spectator a ball and signs his hat before high-fiving a row of on-lookers. DeChambeau looks to be a different man from a few years ago. There was a widely-held perception that the golfer was a highly-strung, uber-competitor, whose desire to win often grated on his rivals. Fast forward to 2024 and DeChambeau looks a lot more comfortable in his skin. That change has seemingly paid huge dividends, with the 30-year-old claiming his second major title over the weekend, winning the US Open at Pinehurst in North Carolina. He did so in spectacular fashion as he held off Rory McIlroy\u2019s challenge and hit a crucial bunker shot on the final hole to leave him a simple putt to clinch the title. DeChambeau called his bunker effort \u201cpossibly my best golf shot of my entire life.\u201d DeChambeau 2:0 is the result of a \u201clot of personal growth,\u201d according to the golfer. \u201c2022 was a rock-bottom year for me and pushed me to be the person I am today. I\u2019ve got a lot of people that have stuck around me from 2022 which has allowed me to be the person I\u2019ve grown to be now and I can\u2019t thank them enough because without them, I wouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d DeChambeau told CNN\u2019s Patrick Snell. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long road but I\u2019m certainly very blessed and thankful to have those individuals sticking with me and continuing to push me forward.\u201d That low point in his life in 2022 coincided with his controversial move to the Saudi-backed LIV Golf as well as his injury struggles. A loss of form resulted in DeChambeau tumble down the world rankings as he struggled with his game to leave him a \u201cpretty deep hole.\u201d \u201cGolf swing wasn\u2019t doing well. Ball striking was terrible. Putting wasn\u2019t great,\u201d he remembers. But, through the help and support of the people around him and hard work on the course, DeChambeau\u2019s 2024 has something of a annus mirabilis. Before appearing at Pinehurst, he had engineered successful appearances at this year\u2019s majors, finishing tied-sixth at The Masters and second at the PGA Championship. The best was still to come though, as DeChambeau showed grit and resilience to claim his second US Open title, all the while showing his appreciation for the support he got over the four days in North Carolina. \u201cMy mission is to continue to expand the game, grow the game globally, domestically. YouTube has really helped me accomplish some of that,\u201d DeChambeau told reporters afterwards. \u201cConsequently I think people have seen who I am on YouTube, which has been fantastic, \u2018cause then I get to play off of it. It just feeds itself out here. \u201cThey just say things that make me interact and engage. When is the next junior club set coming out? \u201cIt\u2019s direct conversations to people that truly engage with what I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s such an awesome, awesome platform for me to show who I truly am.\u201d DeChambeau\u2019s YouTube channel currently has over 700,000 subscribers. He posts educational golf videos, while others are more humorous or involve challenges he tries to complete. He added: \u201cFrom my perspective, I\u2019m just passionate. I really care about doing well out here and showing the fans a side of me that was locked up for so long.\u201d A special day Not only did Sunday\u2019s victory have DeChambeau back in the winner\u2019s circle at a majora for the first time in four years, but it also came on a particularly poignant day for the US golfer. The tournament\u2019s final round fell on Father\u2019s Day \u2013 his dad, Jon, passed away in 2022 and DeChambeau admitted that that memory loomed large on Sunday. \u201cAll day,\u201d DeChambeau told CNN\u2019s Patrick Snell when asked whether he felt Jon\u2019s presence with him during Sunday\u2019s action. \u201cThere were numerous times on 2, 3, 4, even 5 where I was just walking down the fairway thinking about him.\u201d And afterwards, DeChambeau dedicated his US Open victory to his dad. \u201cThis one is for him,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/sport/bryson-dechambeau-reinvention-dad-us-open-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "sports"}}

World No. 3 Aryna Sabalenka told reporters in Berlin at the Ecotrans Ladies Open she was skipping the Olympics, citing WTA tournament participation\u00a0requirements\u00a0and her health. The Belarusian had struggled with a stomach illness during her French Open quarterfinal loss to Mirra Andreeva on June 5, her first defeat before the semifinals of a major since 2022. Tennis at this year\u2019s Olympics will take place on the clay at Roland Garros. \u201cEspecially with all the struggles I was having last month, I feel like I need to take care of my health. \u2026 It\u2019s too much with the scheduling,\u201d Sabalenka said. \u201cIt\u2019s just too much. I made the decision to take care of my health.\u201d Had Sabalenka elected to compete at the Games, she would have been entered as an Individual Neutral Athlete, provided she passed an eligibility review. Belarusian and Russian athletes are prohibited from competing under their nations\u2019 flags due to the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The two-time grand slam champion is the No. 2 seed in the Berlin grass-court tournament this week as she prepares for Wimbledon. This will be her first tournament since the French Open. World No. 10 and three-time grand slam finalist Ons Jabeur also confirmed that she will miss the Games next month, writing on social media that the change of surfaces would put her health at risk. The Tunisian has been dealing with a recurring knee injury. After the clay court season concluded at the French Open, players will now spend the next few weeks playing on grass, a much faster and often slippery surface. The WTA grass court season ends at Wimbledon, with the majority of tournaments throughout rest of the calendar typically being staged on hard courts. However, with the Olympics being held at Roland-Garros, a switch back to the physically taxing clay offers a challenge. \u201cAfter consulting with my medical team regarding attending the Olympics in Paris, we have decided that the quick change of surface and the body\u2019s adaptation required would put my knee at risk and jeopardize the rest of my season,\u201d Jabeur posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. \u201cUnfortunately, I will not be able to participate in the 2024 Paris Olympics. \u201cI have always loved representing my country in any competition, However, I must listen to my body and follow my medical team\u2019s advise.\u201d Sabalenka and Jabeur join Great Britain\u2019s Emma Raducanu in opting not to compete at the Olympics. As a former grand slam winner, Raducanu was offered a wild card spot in the tournament, which would have given her automatic entry into the Games despite her current ranking of No. 165. However, she turned it down saying it wasn\u2019t the \u201cright time\u201d for her this year. \u201cWith the changing surface, it\u2019s just not worth the risk for me at this point,\u201d Raducanu said. Raducanu had dropped out of French Open qualifying to work on building her fitness. Choosing to focus on the grass-court and hard-court portions of the season seemed to pay off, as Raducanu reached the semifinals at the Rothesay Open, a Wimbledon tune-up event, last week.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/sport/aryna-sabalenka-ons-jabeur-miss-olympics-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "sports"}}

However,\u00a0ahead of Paris 2024, Nakamura finds herself at the\u00a0center\u00a0of France\u2019s culture wars. Amid widespread\u00a0rumors\u00a0the singer would\u00a0perform at the Games\u2019 Opening Ceremony, singing an Edith Piaf song,\u00a0some members of France\u2019s far-right have questioned\u00a0whether she embodies French heritage, values and identity.\u00a0Piaf is a key figure in France\u2019s musical \u2013 and national \u2013 identity. \u201cThere\u2019s no way Aya. This is Paris, not the market\u00a0in\u00a0Bamako,\u201d said fringe\u00a0and extreme\u00a0far-right group Les Natifs (Natives) on X, formerly known\u00a0as Twitter, in March, referring to Mali\u2019s capital. Nakamura has defended herself on social media, saying on X: \u201cI\u2019m becoming the number one state subject in debates\u00a0\u2026but what do I really owe you all? Nothing.\u201d The singer has received support from Rachida Dati, France\u2019s Minister of Culture, who spoke out in defence of Nakamura, saying \u201cbe careful of the pretext of attacking someone out of pure racism.\u201d Paris 2024\u2019s organizing committee told CNN: \u201cWe were very shocked by the racist attacks against Aya Nakamura in recent days. We offer our full support to the most listened-to French artist in the world.\u201d Whether Nakamura will perform at the Olympics\u2019 opening ceremony is still unconfirmed, with the Paris 2024 organizing committee telling CNN that they\u00a0\u201cwon\u2019t be confirming or denying\u201d\u00a0any rumors or reports, to \u201cleave room for surprises\u201d on the day. CNN has reached out to Nakamura but she declined to\u00a0be interviewed\u00a0on the matter. \u2018She contributes to French culture\u2019 However, many others in France are all too keen to comment on this cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. Far-right politician Marion Mar\u00e9chal,\u00a0who is the niece\u00a0of far-right National Rally party leader\u00a0Marine Le Pen and a member of the\u00a0Reconqu\u00eate\u00a0party, told French\u00a0television stations BMFTV and Europe 1\u00a0that Nakamura\u00a0\u201cdoes not sing in French,\u201d referencing the blend of Parisian and African\u00a0derived slang\u00a0that often feature in her lyrics. \u201cI think that the people who criticize her actually don\u2019t accept that she embodies France,\u201d\u00a0French activist Rokhaya Diallo told CNN. \u201cThe\u00a0slang she uses is used by young people and a lot of young French people use slang.\u201d Nakamura often uses a mix of verlan and African derived slang from languages such as Bambara, from her birth country Mali,\u00a0in her music. Her number one hit song\u00a0\u201cDjadja,\u201d\u00a0contains the lyric \u201cle monde est tit-pe\u201d \u2013 the world is small \u2013 with word \u2018tit-pe\u2019 inverting the French word \u2018petit.\u2019 Verlan, a type of French slang named after\u00a0the inversion of the French word \u2018l\u2019envers\u2019 \u2013 meaning backwards \u2013 originates from the outskirts of Paris known as \u2018la cit\u00e9\u2019 (the suburbs)\u00a0that have had\u00a0large\u00a0immigrant population. At the inauguration of the\u00a0Olympic Aquatics Centre\u00a0earlier this month, French President Emanuel Macron\u00a0said that Nakamura \u201cspeaks to a good number of our compatriots\u201d and claimed that \u201cthese\u00a0games and ceremonies should reflect us, and she contributes to French culture, to French music.\u201d \u201cI want to defend here these choices and defend the fact that there must be artistic freedom and that politics should not interfere,\u201d added Macron. In an interview with France Inter,\u00a0Macron\u2019s political rival Le Pen, known for her right-wing views, claimed that the President was seeking to \u201coutrage\u201d and \u201chumiliate the French people\u201d when asked whether she thinks Nakamura opening the games would be a\u00a0good symbol. When asked to further explain why this choice would be a humiliation, Le Pen responded \u201cshe does not sing in French, or a foreign language, she sings nonsense.\u201d Speaking to CNN, Professor of Political Science at the University of Nice,\u00a0Vincent\u00a0Martigny, said that\u00a0while\u00a0there are those who believe it is right to promote minorities and their role in French culture, there are others, who hold more traditional views, which he terms as racist in relation to the country\u2019s colonial past. 1998 World Cup There have been moments of\u00a0perceived\u00a0unity in France\u2019s past, notably when the men\u2019s national soccer team won the 1998 World Cup. That triumph helped popularise the slogan \u201cBlack, Blanc, Beur\u201d \u2013 Black, White, Arab\u00a0\u00a0\u2013\u00a0amid a push for unity and inclusion. Beur\u2019 is verlan for the French word \u2018arabe.\u2019 France\u2019s World Cup winning team of 1998\u00a0was made up of a\u00a0diverse\u00a0group\u00a0of players,\u00a0not only of European descent but also from the ex-colonies of France\u00a0and other countries.\u00a0Many thought\u00a0at the time\u00a0that the 1998 team was a sign of a truly integrated, multi-cultural France. But notable social and cultural divisions have emerged in France in recent years. There have been\u00a0multiple bans and restrictions against Islamic dress. The nationwide ban on\u00a0public\u00a0schoolchildren wearing abayas,\u00a0was\u00a0denounced as an \u201cIslamophobic campaign\u201d by\u00a0one\u00a0politician\u00a0on the left.\u00a0Athletes have been banned\u00a0from wearing a hijab while competing representing France\u00a0at the Paris\u00a0Olympic Games. Then there have been multiple protests and riots over police brutality leading to the death of\u00a0some French inhabitants of North and West African heritage\u00a0from the suburbs of Paris, fueling backlash over policing methods in marginalized communities. Nakamura\u2019s\u00a0birth\u00a0country\u00a0of Mali is one of the many\u00a0former\u00a0French colonies. There are millions of French citizens, like Nakamura, who are either themselves immigrants or descendants of immigrants from\u00a0nations formerly colonized by France. These days France\u00a0finds itself embroiled in a very public debate over the recognition and acceptance of its immigrants as the country continues to reckon with its colonial history. Professor Martigny believes that the\u00a0nationalist\u00a0party is \u201cstronger than ever\u201d and that nationalists in France are \u201cmore nationalist\u201d and more open with their views today than they were in the past. Activist Diallo also believes that France is struggling to see itself \u201cas it is\u201d and recognize non-White individuals as fully French. \u201cDespite her successes, despite her undeniable achievements, we still think that it\u2019s not an honor for us to have such a woman represent us,\u201d Diallo told CNN, referring to Nakamura. \u2018The Great Replacement\u2019 theory Political scientist Oliver Roy, who is Professor\u00a0at the EUI School of Transnational Governance, told CNN that a common belief that could be fuelling the culture wars in France is an ideology\u00a0expressed\u00a0\u201cnot just [by] the extreme right, but also part of the traditional centre right\u201d known as \u201cthe great replacement.\u201d He describes\u00a0the term\u00a0as \u201cthe idea that there is a new population coming from the south, which is replacing the old traditional, French population.\u201d However, he maintains that this fear \u201cis not supported by demography, [or] by statistics, and is, of course, very ideological.\u201d According to Martigny, France\u2019s cultural divisions are amplified on social media by both extremes of the political spectrum. \u201cBecause of the social networks, public debates are more violent on these issues than they used to be,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a theatre for the expression of extremely strong minded, sometimes racist, very often offensive comments on Twitter, on X, and on other social networks,\u201d added Martigny. \u201cYou have a lot of X accounts who are really, really, really pro far-right. And so they played a role in discussing these issues and making it a controversy. And then this controversy is exported to the traditional media.\u201d \u2018Show a very optimistic face for France\u2019 As Nakamura was targeted by fringe and extreme far-right groups as well as far-right politicians, in an interview\u00a0with BMFTV and RMC,\u00a0Macron said that \u201cthe reactions shocked me \u2026 there\u00a0were\u00a0truly racist reactions.\u201d However,\u00a0Martigny says he sees\u00a0Macron\u2019s condemnation of the attacks as racist as an attempt to balance the scales after the passing of\u00a0what the professor called\u00a0a \u201cvery restrictive law on immigration\u201d a few months ago. In December, Macron passed a controversial bill calling for tougher immigration that was endorsed by the far-right, and rejected by many in his own camp. Politicians such as Le Pen hailed the legislation as an \u201cideological victory\u201d whilst French health Minister, Aurelien Rousseau resigned in protest.\u00a0It included many amendments tightening immigration laws, one of which dictated children born to foreign parents on French soil would no longer become automatic French citizens but would have to apply for citizenship. \u201cHe needs to make that forgotten in a certain way by showing that he has a sense of balance on these issues,\u201d\u00a0Martigny states. By promoting Nakamura, Martigny believes that Macron\u2019s ambitions may have been to \u201cshow a very optimistic face for France.\u201d \u201c[There are] very strong cultural wars in France revolving around pop stars, and the type of pop stars that you can mobilize or the type of artists that you can mobilize when you want to unite the country.\u201d With less than 100 days to go until the Olympics, many hope Paris 2024 will give France the opportunity to show unity. However, the heated reactions to Nakamura hints at a more pessimistic outlook.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/26/sport/aya-nakamura-france-culture-wars-paris-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_sport_north-korea-soccer-team-inside-spt-intl", "text": "What happens within North Korea\u2019s soccer team has been kept a closely guarded secret since its creation at the end of World War II. Millions around the world caught a glimpse of the North Korean men\u2019s team in two World Cups. The Cheollima \u2013 a mythical winged horse found in East Asian mythology and featured prominently in North Korean society \u2013 beat Italy 1-0 in a stunning performance in Middlesbrough, England, in 1966. However, the team\u2019s appearance at the 2010 tournament in South Africa was far less successful, as the team lost all three of its matches, including a 7-0 shellacking by Portugal. But much like the reclusive nation itself, the team in recent years has fallen back into the shadows. Now in an exclusive interview with CNN Sport, retired North Korean midfielder An Yong Hak, who lives in Japan, has revealed what it\u2019s like to play for the team. The secrecy surrounding the North Korean national team was also evident in the case of star player Han Kwang Song. At his peak, Han was on the roster of Italian giant Juventus and featured in its U-23 side, but then he vanished from the public eye for more than three years. He had been last spotted lifting a trophy with his most recent team, Qatari club Al-Duhail, in 2020 as UN Security Council resolutions later forced the repatriation of all North Korean workers abroad. But that rapid change of fortune \u2013 from playing in top divisions in Italy and Qatar to being stuck at an embassy for the better part of three years \u2013 did not cause the striker to consider quitting soccer. Almost out of nowhere, Han publicly reappeared last November with North Korea for its World Cup qualifiers, scoring a header in a 6-1 drubbing of Myanmar. Retired North Korean midfielder An, who is now 45, laments Han being stuck in diplomatic limbo, saying it was unfortunate that the striker was unable to join Pyongyang\u2019s leading domestic club team \u2013 4.25 SC, or April 25 SC \u2013 sooner \u201cto develop at an age when he could have advanced more.\u201d \u201cHe was stuck in an embassy in China, and he had to train alone for about two to three years. Last September, I think, they let him into the country,\u201d An told CNN Sport, citing a North Korean official he spoke with. Han stayed in the embassy while the North Korean borders were shut due to the Covid-19 pandemic, An added. Born in Japan with a North Korean passport, An represented North Korea on the pitch for 10 years, a national team career which Han told An he enjoyed witnessing, according to the retired international midfielder. An recalled meeting Han for the first time in 2019 in Pyongyang, where he watched the former Cagliari striker play against South Korea, captained by Tottenham Hotspur star Son Heung-min, in a qualifier for the 2022 Qatar World Cup. After that match, An said he was waiting to fly back home to Japan and coincidentally ran into Han and two other North Korean players \u2013 Pak Kwang Ryong and Choe Song Hyok \u2013 who were playing in Austria and Italy respectively at the time. \u201c[Han] told me that he had been watching me at the stadium when I played on the national team,\u201d An said of his first interaction with the striker. An recalled telling Han and the young North Korea players, \u201cYou guys have to do well from now on, and I\u2019ll also go to Italy to cheer you guys on.\u2019\u201d \u201cYes, please come! I\u2019ll come pick you up,\u201d Han replied to An. Then in March this year \u2013 five years and one pandemic later \u2013 the two met again, this time in Tokyo, Japan. \u201cI went to the hotel [the team was staying at] a day after the game, and I told him, \u2018It\u2019s been a long time,\u2019\u201d An said. The pair talked about the previous day\u2019s 2026 World Cup qualifying match where North Korea had lost to Japan by one goal. \u201cHan\u2019s shot had hit the post and it didn\u2019t go in, so we talked about how close he was [to scoring],\u201d said An. \u201cBecause of the sanctions, Han said, \u2018I\u2019m playing in [North Korea],\u2019\u201d said An, adding that there was not much time to get into deeper conversation. He referred to Han as \u201cthe kind of talent that comes around every 10 or 20 years\u201d and as someone who had the potential to become \u201ca world-class player.\u201d \u201cI want him to be a symbol of the DPRK [North Korea] national team\u2026 I would like to see him become a player like Son Heung-min or someone of that caliber,\u201d An said of the 25-year-old Han. \u2018A hoax\u2019 Although North Korea has long isolated itself from the rest of the world, it has frequently participated in international sporting competitions, with the notable exception of during the Covid-19 pandemic. When the Cheollima ended its 2010 World Cup run \u2013 losing every group stage match, against Brazil, Portugal and Ivory Coast \u2013 rumors and reports arose that the players and coaches were subjected to punishments back in Pyongyang. Citing anonymous sources, Radio Free Asia reported that coach Kim Jong Hun was sent to do forced labor, while the players were subjected to \u201charsh ideological criticism,\u201d except An and another North Korean-Japanese striker, Jong Tae Se. CNN could not independently verify this report. An called such reports \u201ca hoax.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard to get information about DPRK, so there are still stories about people being sent to a coal mine after losing a match or being lectured for six hours, but there are no such stories at all, as far as I know,\u201d An said, denying rumors about the isolated country, citing his 10-year career of playing for the national team. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to put an end to that kind of false information,\u201d he said. Earning a spot at the 2010 World Cup marked only the second time North Korea had qualified for the world\u2019s marquee soccer competition since 1966, when the Cheollima made it to the quarterfinals, losing to Portugal 5-3. When North Korea secured its ticket to South Africa, the squad\u2019s players were acknowledged by the regime with a certificate and an apartment in Pyongyang, a rare but well-known practice by the Kim regime to reward loyalty, according to state media KCNA and verified by An. \u201cEveryone received a certificate, and we each received an apartment in Pyongyang,\u201d An said, adding that he did not get one because he is \u201cZainichi Korean.\u201d Koreans who migrated or were forced to move to Japan under colonial rule before the peninsula was divided in half are known in Japanese as \u201cZainichi Korean,\u201d including their descendants. They are eligible to apply for a North Korean passport or acquire South Korean nationality as they are not given Japanese citizenship \u2013 they are, however, legal residents in Japan and can gain citizenship through naturalization. A third generation Zainichi Korean, An holds his North Korean nationality with pride. \u201cMy grandparents kept their DPRK identity, although they could have chosen to live an easy life, so I didn\u2019t want to easily change that identity of mine,\u201d An explained, adding that he also considered South Korea his geographical home. Another Zainichi Korean on the 2010 squad was Jong Tae Se, who grabbed the world\u2019s attention as he broke down in tears during North Korea\u2019s national anthem ahead of the squad\u2019s 2-1 loss to Brazil. Jong\u2019s tears moved the fans and even An said, \u201cMany Zainichi Koreans were extremely moved by it.\u201d \u201cThis Zainichi Korean, born and raised in Japan, had a big dream and made it come true. I was able to stand side-by-side with the athletes from my home country and sing the national anthem,\u201d said An. Earning respect When An joined the North Korean national team upon receiving a call-up letter in 2002, he remembers not being immediately accepted by teammates. \u201cThe players, coaches and managers didn\u2019t know us very well. We needed to be accepted. We weren\u2019t exactly welcomed from the beginning,\u201d the retired midfielder said. North Korean players have strong bonds, as the majority of them \u2013 except for those like Han who used to play abroad and Zainichi Koreans \u2013 reside in the country, and therefore, can be called up for the national team at almost any time, according to An. To be accepted by the squad, newcomer An had to prove himself to the other North Korean players. \u201cI had to compete with the players in daily practice to win their trust and gain recognition. However, practice alone was not enough,\u201d he said. \u201cI scored two goals in a World Cup qualifying match and, by producing a result, I was accepted as a member of the national team,\u201d An said, referring to his brace in a 4-1 win against Thailand in the 2006 World Cup qualifiers. It was then that the team welcomed An wholeheartedly and the squad members became \u201clike a family\u201d to him, he said. \u201cUsually, we\u2019re apart, as I\u2019m in Japan and they are in DPRK\u2026 it is difficult to keep in touch,\u201d he said, reflecting on the unfortunate reality where he cannot even message his friends in Pyongyang. Although, as fate would have it, An met his former teammate and current manager of the North Korean national team, Sin Yong Nam, last March. Sin asked An to visit Pyongyang to share his soccer experience with young, promising talent. \u201cWhen we met again after a long time, I felt nostalgic,\u201d said An as he reflected on meeting his compatriots and former teammates after almost five years. \u201cIf another opportunity arises, I would like to return to Pyongyang and, hopefully, provide some assistance to the national team,\u201d An added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/sport/north-korea-soccer-team-inside-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "sports"}}

It seemed not just unlikely but almost impossible, a pipedream that had a 0.02% chance of coming true, according to stats website data golf, requiring some perfect mixture of luck and skill to produce a miraculous shot on his last hole under the most intense pressure. But Molinari took out his seven-iron on the 194-yard par-three ninth, and his shot landed on the edge of the green before rolling all the way into the hole as he staggered to the side and dropped his shoulders in disbelief. \u201cWhat are the chances, really? I don\u2019t even know what to say,\u201d the 41-year-old Italian told reporters afterward. \u201cJust incredible.\u201d After his hole-in-one, Molinari finished on five-over-par at Pinehurst No. 2 in North Carolina, sneaking inside the cut at the last opportunity. And the 2018 Open Championship winner admitted that he had thought almost all hope of staying in the tournament was lost when he bogeyed the eighth leaving himself with two shots to make up on the last hole. \u201cI just bogeyed eight,\u201d he said. \u201cI was hoping I was able to par eight and then having to make two at nine. With that flag, if you hit a good shot, you can get it within birdie range, but when I dropped a shot at eight \u2026 Standing on the ninth tee it was just put a good swing on it and see what happens.\u201d His playing partners Min Woo Lee and Sergio Garcia celebrated with him as he made the cut for only the second time from eight tournaments on the PGA Tour this year. \u201cSergio was walking in front of me and he raised his hands when the ball was still five meters from the hole and I wanted to tell him, \u2018Come on, don\u2019t jinx me,\u2019\u201d Molinari told Sky Sports. \u201cI haven\u2019t been making a lot of cuts in the last few weeks, I\u2019ve been there or thereabouts and just falling short so it\u2019s nice to see one going my way. Hopefully the first of a few,\u201d he added. The ninth hole proved lucky for Austria\u2019s Sepp Straka too as he made his first ace on the PGA Tour earlier that day, and also made the cut at two over.

{"id": "2024_06_14_sport_scottie-scheffler-ludvig-aberg-us-open-spt-intl", "text": "Many have waxed lyrical about the might of Pinehurst No. 2 across its 117-year history, but on Friday the North Carolina course received perhaps its greatest appraisal yet: it made Scottie Scheffler look human. After exercising a vice-like grip over the golfing realm with an impassive coolness for months on end, the world No. 1\u2019s unflappable brilliance finally buckled during the second round of the 124th US Open on Friday. Scheffler\u2019s run of 168 rounds with at least one birdie went skidding off the sides of Pinehurst\u2019s fiendishly firm and fast greens as he toiled to a four-over par 74, compounding an opening 71. \u201cYesterday I felt like I did a great job. Today I just couldn\u2019t get the putts to fall,\u201d Scheffler told reporters after his round. \u201cThis golf course can be unpredictable at times, and maybe it got the better of me the last couple days. I\u2019ll sit down and think about where we\u2019re going the last few days and figure it out.\u201d How damaging those two days were to Scheffler\u2019s hopes of a sixth win in nine starts was merely a secondary consideration: at five-over overall, the overwhelming tournament favorite arrived at the clubhouse admitting he did not expect to return for the final 36 holes. By the skin of his teeth, Scheffler avoided missing the weekend at a major for the first time since 2022 as another day of high scoring saw the cut line fall at five-over par, edging through the 27-year-old and a host of other relieved stars. \u2018Maybe the worst golf shot I think I\u2019ve ever seen you hit\u2019 It made for an anxious wait after a morning that brimmed with frustration for the typically unflustered Texan. Having started from the 10th tee, Scheffler tossed his putter into the air in exasperation after his par-saving effort at the 15th hole curled away at the death, resigning him to a first bogey of the day. When his opening drive at the 17th veered left, Scheffler muttered to himself in the second person: \u201cMaybe the worst golf shot I think I\u2019ve ever seen you hit.\u201d After a repeat outcome at the subsequent tee box, he slammed his driver on the ground before picking up his tee and throwing it. Despite those errors, the reigning Masters champion generally drove well throughout but struggled on and around the greens, his woes peaking during a disastrous double bogey at the par-five fifth hole. His third shot was an attempted chip onto the green from the native area that gained him mere inches, as his ball caught a slope and rolled back to his feet. Scheffler\u2019s subsequent effort left him even further away from the hole, skipping past the flag and over the other side of the green. There were still a few grains of salt left to rub into the wound, as Scheffler\u2019s putt to escape with a bogey came up four inches short. Incredibly, playing partner and last month\u2019s PGA Championship victor Xander Schauffele endured an almost identical series of unfortunate events for a double bogey of his own, his ball rolling back to him before skidding well past the cup on the next attempt. The world No. 2 put his own frustrations into words candidly after returning to the clubhouse. \u201cThat pissed me off,\u201d Schauffele, who shot one-under 69 to climb into a share of ninth at one-under overall, told reporters. Aberg nudges ahead Though Schauffele remains within striking distance, Scheffler finds himself 10 shots behind Sweden\u2019s Ludvig Aberg, who tops the leaderboard by a stroke at five-under par overall after shooting 69. The 24-year-old has enjoyed a meteoric rise and continues to impress in his first ever US Open appearance and just his third career major outing, having finished second on his Masters debut in April. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that I\u2019m thinking about all the time, but sometimes I have to stop for a little bit and think about how fortunate I am to be able to do this at this level,\u201d world No. 6 Aberg told reporters. \u201cTo be able to play these tournaments, to be able to play with the guys that I\u2019ve watched on TV for such a long time is definitely a pinch-me moment.\u201d Belgium\u2019s Thomas Detry, as well as American duo Bryson DeChambeau and Patrick Cantlay, lead the chasing pack, with Rory McIlroy \u2013 bidding to end a 10-year wait for his fifth major crown \u2013 a stroke behind the trio. Woods uncertain on open future A host of big names fell foul of the cut line, including two of the world\u2019s top-10. Viktor Hovland and Max Homa narrowly missed out at six-over overall, while three-time champion Tiger Woods finished one shot behind the duo. Woods had been competing on a special exemption after failing to qualify for a major for the first time in his professional career, but the 48-year-old showed flashes of his old brilliance as he shot 74 and 73. The 15-time major champion made it to the weekend at the Masters in April but has now missed the cut at successive majors after falling away at the PGA Championship last month. He is eligible to play at next month\u2019s Open Championship in Scotland due to his status as a previous winner yet when asked by CNN\u2019s Patrick Snell if he might have played his last US Open, Woods cast doubt on his future at both open tournaments. \u201cAs far as my last Open Championship or US Open Championship, I don\u2019t know what that is. It may or may not be,\u201d Woods told Snell. \u201cMy ball-striking and felt like my putting was good enough to be in contention and I\u2019m not,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating because I\u2019m not here to have a chance to win on the weekend.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/sport/scottie-scheffler-ludvig-aberg-us-open-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_sport_kathleen-noble-rowing-uganda-paris-olympics-spt-intl", "text": "From learning how to row in boats patched together with duct tape to competing at the world championships in a different sport entirely, Kathleen Noble\u2019s rise to the apex of rowing has certainly been unconventional. Her journey now sees the 29-year-old set to become a two-time Olympian \u2013 Noble represented Uganda at the Tokyo Games \u2013 when she competes at Paris 2024. She is Uganda\u2019s first Olympic rowing participant, as well as the African nation\u2019s first and only White Olympian across any sporting discipline. A prodigious swimmer in her youth, Noble represented Uganda at the 2012 World Swimming Championships at just 17 years of age. Then, on a whim during her time as a student at Princeton University, Noble was convinced to try her hand at rowing. \u201cWhen I took my first steps into the sport, I had no thoughts or intentions of competing at a high level and certainly couldn\u2019t have imagined that this would be the direction that things would go,\u201d Noble tells CNN Sport. \u201cTo be honest, it is still a bit surreal to be competing on a stage like this. I don\u2019t think it was until they actually told me that Uganda wanted to send me to the Olympic qualifiers that I really thought, \u2018Oh, okay, maybe there\u2019s something here.\u2019\u201d Equipment issues The sport of rowing is still very much in its nascent stages across many parts of Africa, including Uganda. It was properly introduced to the country back in 2009 when the World Rowing Federation sent out a shipment of donated boats to help to grow a sport which carries with it significant financial entry barriers. It was on these boats that Noble learned to row skull (individual), as opposed to her time rowing crew (as a team in one boat) at university. Whilst the thought of training on Lake Victoria, one of Africa\u2019s Great Lakes and the world\u2019s largest tropical lake, may bring with it a sense of charm and serenity, trying to prepare to compete at Olympic level just isn\u2019t feasible given the lack of opportunities and investment afforded to rowing within Uganda, a reality which sees Noble now train out of Tennessee under former US rower James Martinez. \u201cThere is no history of rowing in Uganda. I mean, I\u2019m literally the first person, male or female, to even qualify for the Olympics,\u201d Noble says. \u201cIt is still extremely niche, and the community is very small. I probably know every single rower in the country personally. \u201cBack in 2016, I took eight months off from university to row in Uganda and I\u2019m so grateful that I did because I got to experience first-hand all the struggles that rowers back home go through on a daily basis. \u201cNot only is there a lack of competition and adequate coaching, but there is a lack of most basic essentials, such as having properly functioning equipment. \u201cWhen I was rowing on Lake Victoria, we were still using the boats donated back in 2009. We would be duct-taping them and trying to get people to patch them up with fiberglass for us.\u201d It is not just a lack of equipment which has hampered rowing\u2019s growth in the east African country. Governance is also a major issue, and the absence of proper oversight has seen many athletes leave the sport in recent times, according to Noble, due to \u201cpromises being made but not always being kept.\u201d The only way the sport has a chance to progress is through the help and funding from outside donors such as the World Rowing Federation. Muhumuza Rodrick Chandi,\u00a0the technical director of the Uganda\u00a0Rowing Federation, tells CNN Sport that the price of equipment and a lack of coaches has been an issue in the country. \u201cIt is true that there is a lack of coaches as most qualified ones have left Uganda in search of greener pastures,\u201d he says.\u00a0\u201cRowing, like most sports in Uganda, is voluntary, so once these coaches get better opportunities they migrate or leave the sport altogether. \u201cThe Ugandan Rowing Federation does suffer from a lack of funding, mainly because it doesn\u2019t get much budgetary support from the National Council of Sports as it\u2019s considered a small sport.\u201d \u2018Honor\u2019 representing Uganda Born in Nakaseke, central Uganda, in 1994, Noble is the daughter of Irish missionaries. \u201cUganda was a fantastic place to grow up in many ways, whether it be the great weather all year round or the friendly and cheerful nature of the people,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut as a White, blonde child, I maybe would have had an aversion to going out in public due to the amount of attention I\u2019d have gotten.\u201d Despite her differences, of which Noble is acutely aware, sport has allowed her to form a deeper connection with her birthplace. \u201cEven though I have Ugandan citizenship, there is an identity to being Ugandan which is about coming from one of the local tribes and having land and a history and ancestors going back a long way,\u201d she says. \u201cI respect that, but at the same time, I did grow up in Uganda. It\u2019s a place that is important to me and it does mean a lot to me to have people accept me as being Ugandan. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge honor to represent my country. It\u2019s been the way that I\u2019ve felt the most connection to my identity as a Ugandan. Growing up there, when people ask you where you\u2019re from, I would say Ireland, even though I was born and grew up there. \u201cBut I feel like as I\u2019ve gotten deeper into representing and rowing for the country, I have felt more strongly that I am Ugandan.\u201d Noble\u2019s acceptance by Ugandan sports fans has also been a great source of encouragement. While she says that she will occasionally receive the odd message on social media criticizing her for representing the country, the overwhelming majority of both fan and media messaging has been support and pride for raising the profile of Ugandan rowing. \u201cYou\u2019re always going to have haters and people who want to try to knock you down, that\u2019s kind of to be expected in high level sport nowadays with social media \u2026 but I find it extremely touching that whenever I am met with negativity, a barrage of positivity will follow,\u201d says Noble. \u201cI\u2019m very, very grateful for that.\u201d Platform for change Noble, on top of her sporting ambitions, works as a software engineer in Tennessee and, alongside her husband, is a homesteader with a small-scale farm producing food and animals for themselves. Like every athlete, she hopes that her Olympic journey will culminate atop the podium, but she does also head to Paris with a compelling sense of realism. \u201cRowing is not really a sport where you wake up and just have a great day and row faster than you ever have before,\u201d says Noble. \u201cIt is a little bit more deterministic than that. Sports that are really based around cardiovascular strength tend to remove that element of major surprise around results. I\u2019m not going to flat out say that my goal isn\u2019t to medal, but at the same time I need to be realistic.\u201d Winning a medal is not the only means by which you can determine an Olympian\u2019s success, though, with Noble hoping that her exposure during the Games can help to elevate rowing back in Uganda, ensuring that she is no longer its sole representative. \u201cI feel a sense of responsibility to try and help support athletes back home,\u201d she says. \u201cWhether that correlates to me having to do well, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily true. I get a lot of press whether I come first or last. \u201cI believe that the actual position that I come is less important than the spotlight that exists around the Olympics. That gives me the platform to raise awareness about the limitations and struggles that athletes have in Uganda to a global audience.\u201d Rowing, particularly singles rowing, can be a very isolating sport, a fact that Noble can attest to. But come July 26 when the Paris Games get underway, she will have the backing of an entire nation eager to witness what will, no matter the end result, be more Olympic history for Uganda.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/sport/kathleen-noble-rowing-uganda-paris-olympics-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_sport_carlos-alcaraz-french-open-tennis-spt-intl", "text": "As a child, Carlos Alcaraz used to run home from school to watch the French Open on TV, dreaming of one day playing on the tournament\u2019s clay courts and becoming champion. That dream became a reality on Sunday as the Spaniard defeated world No. 4 Alexander Zverev in five sets to lift his third grand slam title \u2013 all at the age of only 21. In a gritty and often unpredictable performance on Court Philippe-Chatrier, Alcaraz showed his trademark fight and resilience against Zverev, coming back from two sets to one down to become the youngest man to win major titles on clay, grass and hard courts. \u201cHonestly, first of all, I\u2019m exhausted,\u201d Alcaraz told CNN Sport\u2019s Amanda Davies the day after claiming his first title at Roland Garros. \u201cIt was a really tough one. It is a dream come true for me. I really wanted to lift this trophy one day, and then to be able to do it is a great feeling. \u201cThis tournament, I\u2019ve watched it since I was five, six years old \u2026 Being in this position right now is so, so special,\u201d he added. With Alcaraz\u2019s latest success comes yet another tattoo. He already has the dates of his grand slam wins at the US Open and Wimbledon \u2013 the latter alongside a strawberry synonymous with the tournament \u2013 inked on his skin, and now plans to get the Eiffel Tower and Sunday\u2019s date on his left ankle. It seems a fitting choice: after his victory in the City of Light, Alcaraz shared an old photo of himself aged 12, watching the tournament on a big screen in the shadow of the Paris landmark. Is he worried about running out of skin space, should he continue to accumulate more grand slam titles? \u201cThis is good news if that happens,\u201d said Alcaraz. \u201cI said to my family and to my team that it\u2019s going to be the first grand slam. If I win another French Open, I\u2019m not going to get a tattoo.\u201d With his victory over Zverev, the world No. 2 joins a long line of Spanish men to have lifted the French Open title. Rafael Nadal leads the way with a record-breaking 14 titles, while Juan Carlos Ferrero, Albert Costa, Carlos Moy\u00e1 and Sergi Bruguera have all been champions since 1993. \u201cI really wanted to put my name on that list as well,\u201d said Alcaraz, who is now coached by 2003 winner Ferrero. Having sustained an arm injury ahead of this year\u2019s French Open, the Murcia native withdrew from the Italian Open but has exceeded his expectations physically over the past two weeks, winning four of his seven matches in three sets. It was only against Zverev and new world No. 1 Jannik Sinner that Alcaraz went the distance \u2013 the first man in the Open Era to win the final and the semifinal of the French Open in five sets. After losing the third set against Zverev, letting slip a 5-2 lead, he had to dig deep into his energy reserves and raise his intensity, racing around the court and chasing down every shot. The two highlights were a so-called \u201cbanana\u201d forehand \u2013 made famous by Nadal \u2013 in the fourth set and a stunning backhand passing shot when Alcaraz had seemed certain to lose the point in the deciding set. \u201cIf I lost, I wanted to do it fighting until the last ball, running, playing my best tennis,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I thought about in that moment: to keep trying to find solutions.\u201d Alcaraz\u2019s attention now turns to Wimbledon, where he will defend the title he won in dramatic fashion against Novak Djokovic last year, and then the Olympics in Paris, which will mean a return to Roland Garros. There, he hopes to play doubles alongside Nadal \u2013 potentially one of the 22-time grand slam champion\u2019s final tournaments \u2013 as well as going for a gold medal in the singles competition. \u201cI\u2019ve won Roland Garros and I\u2019m going for the Olympics,\u201d said Alcaraz. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to get both.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/sport/carlos-alcaraz-french-open-tennis-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "sports"}}

{"id": "2024_06_18_sport_cristiano-ronaldo-portugal-record-euro-2024-spt-intl", "text": "Cristiano Ronaldo made history by becoming the first player to feature in six European Championships as Portugal came from behind to beat Czech Republic 2-1 in Leipzig at Euro 2024 on Tuesday. The 39-year-old made his tournament debut back in 2004, when host Portugal was beaten by Greece in the final. He went on to lead his nation to victory at Euro 2016, his only major trophy at international level, though he had to be substituted in the first half of the final after picking up an injury. Despite currently playing outside of Europe\u2019s main top-five leagues \u2013 he\u2019s now with\u00a0Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr \u2013 Ronaldo was picked by Portugal coach Roberto Martinez who praised the veteran striker for his goalscoring prowess before the tournament started. The forward started his country\u2019s opening Group F match against Czech Republic but, despite some flashes of quality, he had a relatively quiet game, though he did hit the post late on with a header, which was then turned in by Diogo Jota. However, the goal was ruled out by the video assistant referee (VAR) as Ronaldo was narrowly offside. But Portugal kept searching for a winner and substitute Francisco Concei\u00e7\u00e3o scored a dramatic late winner in the 92nd minute, tapping home from close range. Despite Portugal dominating proceedings, it was Czech Republic which scored first, courtesy of Luk\u00e1\u0161 Provod\u2019s fantastic long-range effort in the 62nd minute. Moments later, Portugal equalized thanks to a huge slice of luck. Czech Republic goalkeeper Jind\u0159ich Stan\u011bk failed to deal with a simple cross and parried it against his own defender, with the ball bouncing off Robin Hran\u00e1\u010d into the goal. Ronaldo has scored in all five of the European Championships that he\u2019s played in and is the competition\u2019s record goalscorer with 14 goals. He has the chance to become the oldest goalscorer at the Euros should he find the net in Germany this year. Ronaldo wasn\u2019t the only Portuguese player to make history on Tuesday.

{"id": "2023_09_20_sport_saudi-arabia-soccer-spl-bin-salman-intl-spt-cmd-dg", "text": "When Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal reportedly planned a $1.1 billion bid to sign French soccer superstar Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 \u2013 including $332 million to his club, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), and an eye-watering $775 million salary packet to the World Cup winner for just one year \u2013 it was slammed by critics as sportswashing. Mbapp\u00e9 might have said no to the offer in July, but a month later, Neymar Jr. said yes to Al-Hilal, as the Brazil star moved from PSG for a transfer fee of around $98.5 million (\u20ac90 million) plus add-ons, according to multiple reports. In a record-breaking transfer window, Saudi Pro League (SPL) clubs spent close to $1 billion, acquiring 94 overseas players from Europe\u2019s major leagues \u2013 France\u2019s Ligue 1, Spain\u2019s La Liga, Italy\u2019s Serie A, Germany\u2019s Bundesliga and the English Premier League \u2013 according to Deloitte. Despite the Arab nation\u2019s poor human rights record, Saudi Arabia\u2019s spending spree to turn its domestic soccer league into a star-studded, bona fide competition shows the seriousness of its ambition. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman says he doesn\u2019t \u201ccare\u201d about the country\u2019s investment in sport being described as sportswashing. \u201cWell if sportswashing is going to increase my GDP by one percent, then I will continue doing sportswashing,\u201d MBS said in an\u00a0interview\u00a0with Fox News which aired Wednesday. Pressed on if he was bothered by the use of the term, MBS continued: \u201cI don\u2019t care. I have one percent GDP growth from sport, and I am aiming for another one and a half percent. Call it whatever you want, we\u2019re going to get that one and a half percent.\u201d Saudi clubs, several of which have been taken over by the nation\u2019s sovereign Public Investment Fund (PIF), have already attracted some of the biggest names in the sport. By attracting some of the world\u2019s biggest stars to the Gulf states, the SPL wants \u201cto drive competitiveness on and off the pitch,\u201d though it\u2019s keen to emphasize that these overseas players will help develop \u201cyoung Saudi talent.\u201d During this summer transfer window, the government-controlled PIF increased the cumulative value of these four clubs nearly five times, making them the most valuable in the country, according to estimates by the sports website Transfermarkt. Plenty of other leading stars have eagerly said yes to the SPL, notably 2022 Ballon D\u2019Or winner Karim Benzema joining Al-Ittihad at the end of his contract with Spanish soccer giant Real Madrid. As the European transfer window came to a close, the four PIF-owned teams have spent nearly $900 million (\u20ac835.1 million) on buying elite international players, Transfermarkt data shows, which ranked them in the top 20 clubs in the world by transfer expenditure, alongside soccer giants from England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy. Al Hilal alone paid more than $378 million (\u20ac353 million), more than PSG and Arsenal, making it the second-largest spender this year. The newly acquired players join five-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, who has a two-year contract with Al-Nassr where he will earn a staggering estimated $200 million a year, according to Saudi state-owned media, currently making him the world\u2019s highest paid soccer player. As of today, 21 of the most expensive soccer players in Saudi Arabia by transfer fees \u2013 all international stars \u2013 play for one of the PIF-owned clubs. Despite the financial outlay, the SPL is remaining deliberately tight-lipped about the specifics of its financial gamble, with chief operating officer Carlo Nohra confirming to CNN Sport that it was \u201cnot in [the SPL\u2019s] competitive advantage\u201d to report the salaries offered to players and coaches. The PIF has $777 billion in assets under management, according to its most recent filing, with ambitions to top $1 trillion within a few years. In 2021, it acquired English soccer club Newcastle United, before focusing on investments at home. The club is now also among top spenders on players. Saudi clubs not owned by the PIF are also splurging on big-ticket players, with former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson, 33, offered an eye-watering salary of $870,000 (\u00a3700,000) per week, according to multiple reports, in an estimated $15 million (\u00a312 million) transfer from Liverpool to Saudi team Al-Ettifaq. In a recent interview with The Athletic, Henderson said those numbers \u201cjust aren\u2019t true.\u201d \u201cEssentially, the signal is \u2018We mean business,\u2019\u201d Simon Chadwick, a professor of sport and geopolitical economy at SKEMA Business School, told CNN.\u201cWe\u2019ve got so much money that for a player who is \u2026 coming towards the end of his career, we can afford to pay him 700,000 [GB pounds a week], or whatever it is that he\u2019s being paid, and still have Cristiano Ronaldo and still be in the market for other players as well,\u201d Chadwick said, describing Saudi\u2019s approach to becoming a sporting superpower, adding that the sky is the limit in terms of cost. Saudi\u2019s love of soccer Saudi Arabia follows in the footsteps of several other countries \u2013 including China and Qatar in investing large sums of money to try and turn themselves into soccer powerhouses. It remains to be seen whether Saudi\u2019s turbocharged investment will have a lasting impact or resemble something like a costly rebranding effort. The Saudi national team has been to multiple World Cups, and the country\u2019s clubs have won multiple Asian titles. Saudi\u2019s victory over Argentina during last year\u2019s men\u2019s World Cup was hailed as one of the greatest upsets in tournament history, with the country\u2019s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud granting a national public holiday in recognition of the win. Club games can attract huge crowds in the Middle Eastern nation. \u201cFor example, Al-Ittihad against Al-Hilal, you\u2019re talking about drawing crowds of 40, 50, 60,000 people, these are games that are comparable in size to Chelsea vs. Arsenal, Manchester United vs. Manchester City,\u201d Chadwick said. Buying star players, some arguably past their prime, also provides an easy win for Saudi teams, according to Kieran Maguire, co-host of \u201cThe Price of Football\u201d podcast. \u201cFrom the Saudi authorities\u2019 point of view, they\u2019re getting a ready-made product. Everybody\u2019s heard of Benzema. Everybody\u2019s heard of Cristiano Ronaldo and so on,\u201d Maguire said. Saudi Arabia\u2019s lofty sporting ambitions don\u2019t end with the SPL or Newcastle United. The country is hosting the 2023 FIFA Club World Cup and is bidding to host the 2027 AFC Asian Cup. Several media reports also indicated that the Gulf kingdom was considering launching a bid for the 2030 FIFA men\u2019s World Cup alongside Greece and Egypt \u2013 although it is reportedly mulling pulling its candidacy. Meanwhile, the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) has agreed to a contract that will see the Spanish Super Cup played in Saudi Arabia until 2029, a deal that will earn the Spanish governing body between \u20ac35-45 million ($38-48 million) a year. Appealing to the youth Saudi Arabia has a very young population: the country\u2019s most recent census revealed 32.2 million people live in the country, nearly 42% of whom are foreign nationals \u2013 and 51% of the Saudi population are under the age of 30.\u202fOf this populace, Saudi authorities say that over 80% play, attend or follow soccer, the national sport. Chadwick explains that Saudi Arabia\u2019s government is concerned with the prospect of its younger members of society becoming radicalized or an anti-government sentiment bubbling up like that of the Arab Spring \u2013 and looks to offer its population a thriving soccer industry to keep it placated. Though the soccer industry generates employment, revenues, export earnings and inward investment, \u201cwhat is just as significant is the security of the royal family,\u201d Chadwick adds. The Arab Spring, a wave of pro-democracy protests that washed over the Middle East and North Africa in 2011, achieved mixed results. Four Arab dictators in Libya, Yemen, Egypt and Tunisia were toppled, offering a brief sense of victory for protesters, but, since then, new wars have prompted a retreat of popular movements in the region. Meanwhile, failed uprisings in Bahrain and eastern Saudi Arabia were followed by years-long crackdowns and a continuing civil war in Syria. \u201cWhat we\u2019re beginning to see in Saudi Arabia right now is the emergence of a new social contract. And the social contract essentially is catering for the needs of the Gen Z population,\u201d Chadwick said. \u201cYou want Ronaldo? You got him. You want some of the best football teams in the world? You got them. You want the World Cup to come to Saudi Arabia? You got it \u2026 But don\u2019t question us,\u201d Chadwick explained. Maguire agrees, noting that investing in soccer \u201ccan be seen as part of a much broader socio-economic plan, run by the Saudi authorities.\u201d At the same time, there has been \u201ca significant increase in the number of Saudi Arabians detained by the authorities, for example, for posting adverse comments on social media about the country\u201d this year, Chadwick told CNN. Human rights group Amnesty International told CNN that it has documented a rollback in human rights in Saudi Arabia, including an escalating crackdown on freedom of expression and an increased use of counterterrorism and cybercrime laws to silence dissent. Between 2022 and 2023, the organization said it has documented an increase in criminal prosecutions compared to previous years. In 2022, Amnesty reported the highest number of annual executions in the country in 30 years, with 196 people killed. \u201cReputation is important in terms of attracting foreign investment, and \u2026 Mohammed bin Salman, as much as he has significant financial muscle, needs foreign investing for the realization of his diversification,\u201d James Dorsey, the author of the syndicated column and blog, \u201cThe Turbulent World of Middle East Soccer,\u201d explains. Saudi Arabia is the world\u2019s biggest exporter of crude oil, and nearly two-thirds of its income still comes from selling fossil fuels. But with oil prices regularly dipping below what the Gulf state needs to balance its budget, it has focused efforts on trying to bring in investment from abroad along with its efforts to raise oil prices. Projections indicate the kingdom has around 20 years to diversify its economy to ensure it is more resilient, according to Chadwick \u2013 not least to fund its Vision 2030 projects, including the $500 billion Neom city, a 106 mile-long linear city called The Line and a futuristic plan to revamp the capital. \u201cPart of the grand vision of Mohammed bin Salman, looking forward to 2030, he does have his desire to make Saudi Arabia less dependent on natural resources to look at a post-fuel economy [involving] tourism, entertainment. If Saudi Arabia can become a hub for major sporting events, then that\u2019s a way of attracting interest to the country,\u201d said Maguire. CNN has reached out to the Saudi Ministry of Sport for comment on allegations that the kingdom has been rolling back human rights, and investing in soccer as a way of \u201csportswashing\u201d its image. In response to previous criticism about Saudi Arabia\u2019s purported \u201csportswashing,\u201d the kingdom\u2019s sports minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal said: \u201cPeople that don\u2019t know Saudi Arabia, have never been to Saudi Arabia, go out and talk about it as if they\u2019ve lived there for 30 years, 40 years. So I always tell people, come to Saudi. Come and see Saudi. \u201cSee what it is, see the people, meet the people. Look at what the country is doing for the future of the people in Saudi, then you can criticize as much as you like,\u201d he added. Lack of transparency: Saudi threatens new systems of governance\u202fin sports Saudi Arabia has already disrupted the golf industry and, with soccer, Maguire told CNN, \u201cthey feel that they can do that probably on a smaller scale, but perhaps, ultimately, to generate more interest in terms of eyeballs if they go down the same route.\u201d In 2021, the Saudi government-controlled PIF bankrolled LIV Golf, reportedly at a cost of $2 billion, attracting many of the sport\u2019s top players away from the US-based PGA Tour and Europe-based DP World Tour by offering big dollar prize money, with PGA Tour board member Jimmy Dunne raising fears that they might end up \u201cowning golf.\u201d Earlier this year, the US-based PGA Tour announced it was set to partner with the Saudi-backed breakaway LIV Golf, ending a feud that has dogged the men\u2019s professional game for the past year, with Dunne warning that sport\u2019s governing body had no choice but to reach the truce to retain some measure of control. \u201cThey have an unlimited horizon and an unlimited amount of money,\u201d he said at a contentious Senate hearing on the truce between the two tours. When it comes to soccer, Aleksander Ceferin, president of European football\u2019s governing body UEFA, has dismissed the competitive threat that the SPL could pose. \u201cAs far as I know, Mbappe and [Erling] Haaland don\u2019t dream of Saudi Arabia. I don\u2019t believe that the best players at the pinnacle of their careers would go to Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said last month. \u201cWhen people talk to me about the players who went there, nobody knows where they\u2019re playing.\u201d Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp took a different view, referring to the fact that the Saudi summer transfer window stays open after European clubs see theirs close: \u201cI don\u2019t know how stable it is and I think the next two weeks will show how much of a challenge it is because whatever happens there, no one can react anymore. \u201cI don\u2019t know where it will lead to but it feels rather like a threat or a concern than not because I can\u2019t see how we really deny it in these moments, what can we do?\u201d he added. Still, the new SPL director of football, Michael Emenalo, says what Saudi soccer is doing is \u201cno different from what the Premier League have done.\u201d \u201cThere was a time when it was all about Italy. There was a time when it was all about Spain. What we\u2019re looking for in the industry is an opportunity to compete, and to compete on an even scale and to improve upon whatever exists in the industry,\u201d said Emenalo in a press release sent to CNN. New Saudi Pro League Chief Operating Officer Carlo Nohra told CNN that there is logic behind the league\u2019s strategy of money is no object to lure international stars. \u201cWe can\u2019t expect to be paying market value to entice people to come here at this early stage in our development.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0But analysts say that the difference lies in the level of transparency, which \u201csimply doesn\u2019t exist in Saudi Arabia,\u201d Chadwick explained to CNN. European soccer governing body UEFA has financial fair play (FFP) rules on teams\u2019 spending, while Major League Soccer in the US has a salary cap for its clubs. Nohra told CNN that, eventually, the country wants 0.3% of its GDP to be from soccer to make it similar to that of the Premier League on the UK economy \u2013 up from its current value of \u201c0.000 something.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve got no chance to get into that figure at present,\u201d Maguire explained, but added that the SPL could perhaps move into the top 10 of the world\u2019s domestic leagues. \u201cThat is feasible given the amount of money that they\u2019re spending.\u201d \u201cI think they\u2019re realistic. They don\u2019t say that they\u2019re going to overtake La Liga or the Premier League or the major European leagues,\u201d Maguire said. When the Peterson Institute for International Economics compared the world\u2019s sovereign wealth funds on criteria including governance, transparency and accountability in 2019, the PIF scored well below average on a measure combining these criteria, and ranked in the bottom 10 out of 64 funds, just above Russian Direct Investment Fund. CNN has reached out to the PIF for further comment about its investments in sport, particularly soccer and golf, and criticisms about its lack of transparency. Chadwick raised concerns over how a lack of financial rules affecting Saudi clubs might dilute UEFA\u2019s FFP regulations, as well as those of the Premier League, or impact world soccer governing body FIFA\u2019s systems of governance. The lack of transparency in Saudi Arabia\u2019s wealth fund has already raised suspicions in the US golfing and political spheres. Earlier this summer, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations launched an inquiry about the PGA Tour\u2019s agreement with the PIF-controlled LIV Golf.

In 1967, before he climbed up to the majors, Jackson played with the\u00a0Birmingham A\u2019s\u00a0in the\u00a0Double-A\u00a0Southern League\u00a0as one of the few Black players on the team. The team played at Rickwood Field. The baseball legend, who was part of Fox\u2019s broadcast crew for Thursday\u2019s game, said during the broadcast that his return to the place where his baseball career kicked off was \u201cnot easy.\u201d \u201cThe racism when I played here, the difficulty of going through different places where we traveled,\u201d Jackson said on the Fox broadcast. \u201cFortunately I had a manager and I had players on the team that helped me get through it, but I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anybody.\u201d He said he would never want to relive that part of his life. \u201cI walked into restaurants and they would point at me and say \u2018a n***er can\u2019t eat here.\u2019 I would go to a hotel and they would say, \u2018a n***er can\u2019t stay here,\u2019\u201d he said. One violent incident that happened in 1980, when Jackson was a player with the Yankees. A few hours after a victorious game, a man fired his gun at Jackson over a parking space dispute on a New York street. Jackson was looking for a parking space when a car blocked his way. When Jackson asked the driver to move, a passenger in the car yelled racial slurs at Jackson and threw a broken bottle at Jackson\u2019s car. A man in the car then fired three shots at Jackson, each of which missed. News of the incident was one of the first stories broadcast on CNN during its inaugural broadcast. The baseball legend was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1993. In 21 big league seasons \u2013 including with the New York Yankees and the Los Angeles Angels \u2013 Jackson finished with 563 home runs. Jackson was named the World Series MVP in 1973 and 1977. During the 1977 World Series, he hit three home runs on three pitches, earning him the nickname \u201cMr. October.\u201d Jackson was a 14-time American League All-Star, a member of five World Series championship teams and a winner of the American League MVP Award in 1973. Thursday\u2019s\u00a0MLB game came three days after legendary Hall of Famer Willie Mays died at age 93. Mays played for the Birmingham Black Barons, a Negro League baseball team that called Rickwood Field home until their last season in\u00a01963. The game between the San Francisco Giants and St. Louis Cardinals both paid tribute to the Negro Leagues and honored Mays\u2019s legacy. Approximately 60 Negro League players were in attendance \u2013 marking the largest official gathering of the league\u2019s players in nearly 30 years, according to\u00a0the MLB. Jackson said he admired Mays because he taught players who came after him how to play by watching how he approached the game. Jackson said, however,\u00a0\u201cthey grew up in an era when if you had a complaint about the game or a complaint about society \u2013 you suppressed it. Today\u2019s player doesn\u2019t do that.\u201d \u201cThe way that he showed the love of the game, the way he respected the game \u2013 even when he had a complaint about what may have been going on about minorities or whatever,\u201d Jackson said on the Fox broadcast. \u201cIn\u00a0his era\u00a0\u2026\u00a0you didn\u2019t speak about it. He loved the game so much that he refrained.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/sport/reggie-jackson-racism-birmingham/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "sports"}}

The FFF said Mbapp\u00e9 was taken to a local hospital, where X-rays confirmed the break. \u201cKylian Mbapp\u00e9 suffered a broken nose during the second half of the Austria v France match this Monday in D\u00fcsseldorf,\u201d the statement said, per Reuters. \u201cThe captain of the French team was first taken care of by the medical staff and doctor Franck Le Gall, who diagnosed a broken nose.

{"id": "2024_06_15_sport_euro-2024-switzerland-hungary-spain-croatia-italy-albania-spt-intl", "text": "Spain kicked off its Euro 2024 campaign with a statement 3-0 win over Croatia to earn a vital three points in the tournament\u2019s \u2018Group of Death.\u2019 La Roja was out of the blocks rapidly and made Croatia pay for a sluggish start. First-half goals from \u00c1lvaro Morata, Fabi\u00e1n Ruiz and Dani Carvajal \u2013 fresh from scoring in the Champions League final \u2013 opened up a dominant lead that the Kockasti never looked like coming back from. As well as Spain and Croatia, Group B also features defending champion Italy \u2013 all three teams are ranked in the top 10 of FIFA\u2019s world rankings \u2013 and surprise package Albania, which finished top of its qualifying group ahead of Czechia and Poland. It was an uncharacteristically sloppy start for a vastly experienced Croatia side, which has punched above its weight at international tournaments in recent years, reaching the final and then the semifinal at consecutive World Cups. The midfield trio of Luka Modri\u0107, Marcelo Brozovi\u0107\u00a0and Mateo Kova\u010di\u0107 alone boasted 372 caps for Croatia but were largely ineffective throughout. The Croatian defense was pulled apart with ease for the opening goal just before the half hour mark, allowing Morata to run through on goal from Ruiz\u2019s pass and calmly slot the ball past Dominik Livakovi\u0107. That strike moved the 31-year-old up to joint-third on the all-time scoring list at European Championships with seven goals, behind only Cristiano Ronaldo and Michel Platini. The next goal came just three minutes later as Ruiz danced around weak challenges from Modri\u0107 and Brozovi\u0107 on the edge of the area before drilling the ball low into the bottom corner. Carvajal then made it three on the stroke of half-time, timing his run perfectly to slide into the six-yard box and turn Lamine Yamal\u2019s pinpoint cross past Livakovi\u0107. Both teams had plenty of chances to add to the scoreline in the second half, but were thwarted by poor finishing and a brilliant save from Livakovi\u0107 which denied Barcelona youngster Yamal a record-breaking goal. Croatian fans thought they at least had a moment to cheer in the closing stages when Bruno Petkovi\u0107 scored at the second attempt after seeing his initial penalty saved. However, the video assistant referee (VAR) ruled that Ivan Peri\u0161i\u0107 had encroached into the area during the spot kick before he squared the ball back to Petkovi\u0107. It capped a miserable afternoon for Croatia and the team will have to improve dramatically when it faces Albania and Italy to have any hope of qualifying for the knockout stages. Italy vs. Albania Defending champion Italy had to come from a goal behind to earn an unconvincing 2-1 against win against Albania. An early Azzurri error gifted Albania the lead after just 23 seconds, as Nedim Bajrami pounced to score the fastest goal in European Championship history. However, two goals in the space of five minutes from Alessandro Bastoni and Nicol\u00f2 Barella quickly turned the game on its head and Italy was able to hold on for three important points in the \u2018Group of Death.\u2019 Though far from a vintage Italian performance, this team is vastly experienced and knows how to defend a lead and see out a game when it matters the most. Next up will be the far greater challenge of Spain when the two teams meet in a crunch clash on Thursday, with a winner guaranteed a place in the knockout stages. Italy\u2019s night got off to the worst start imaginable when Federico Dimarco\u2019s errant throw-in went straight to Bajrami\u2019s feet, allowing the forward to shift the ball to his right and hammer his effort in at the near post. But Italy found an equalizer only 10 minutes later after poor defending left Bastoni completely unmarked at the far post to head home from Lorenzo Pellegrini\u2019s cross. Barella\u2019s goal five minutes later capped a frenzied opening 15 minutes, hitting a crisp strike past goalkeeper Thomas Strakosha after the ball had bounced around inside the penalty area. The Kuqezinjt\u00eb applied plenty of pressure in the closing stages and Italy had goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma to thank for keeping out Rey Manaj\u2019s effort when the Albania forward was through on goal. It was stoic performance in the second half from Albania, the second-lowest ranked team in the tournament, and the players lined up in front of their fans to soak in the applause in what is only the country\u2019s second appearance at a European Championship. Hungary vs. Switzerland First-half goals from Kwadwo Duah and Michel Aebischer set Switzerland on course for a crucial, hard-fought 3-1 win over Hungary in Group A. Barnab\u00e1s Varga pulled a goal back for a much improved Hungary in the second half, but Breel Embolo capitalized on a defensive error to put the game beyond doubt in stoppage time. It was an uncharacteristically sloppy defensive performance from the Magyars, who qualified for Euro 2024 unbeaten after conceding just seven goals in eight games. Though the team improved as the match wore on, an experienced Swiss side weathered the storm after Varga\u2019s goal gave Hungary some momentum, before Embolo \u2013 whose thigh strapping fell off as he ran through on goal \u2013 coolly lobbed the ball over goalkeeper P\u00e9ter Gul\u00e1csi following Attila Fiola\u2019s errant header. The win puts Switzerland second in Group A behind Germany following Die Mannschaft\u2019s big 5-1 win over Scotland on Friday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/sport/euro-2024-switzerland-hungary-spain-croatia-italy-albania-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "sports"}}

{"id": "2023_02_05_sport_head-injury-suicide-female-athletes-intl-spt-cmd", "text": "Kelly Catlin and Ellie Soutter never met, but they had a lot in common.  Both were commanding athletes: Catlin, a US track cyclist, was a three-times world champion and Olympic silver medalist, and Soutter, a snowboarder, was tipped to be one of Team Great Britain\u2019s strongest contenders for the 2022 Winter Olympics, having already won a bronze medal at the 2017 European Youth Olympic Festival.  Both were incredibly smart \u2013 Catlin was studying for a master\u2019s degree in computational and mathematical engineering at Stanford University, while Soutter learned to speak French in about six months, according to her father.   At times they almost seemed superhuman. In 2013, after only three weeks of formal training and having broken her wrist, Soutter became British Champion with her arm in a cast. Meanwhile, Catlin, who had a tenderness for children, once rode 80 miles through sleet and snow to speak to a grade school about her Olympic experience.    Yet these two women\u2019s lives were tragically cut short after they sustained serious head injuries in their pursuit of sporting greatness and then took their own lives. Catlin was 23, while Soutter died by suicide on her 18th birthday.  Females may be more susceptible to concussion, and they also have worse and prolonged symptoms after their injury than men, according to a review of 25 studies of sport-related concussion published in the Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine.  However, women remain significantly underrepresented within sport and exercise science research. This, leading experts warn, means they often do not get the treatment or aftercare they need following a head injury.  Women\u2019s sports have historically not received the same attention or funding as men\u2019s sports, Dr. Ann McKee, Director of the Boston University Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s been shown that women athletes are more likely to get a concussion, they tend to have longer recovery periods,\u201d McKee added. \u201cWe do not have enough information about what happens in the female brain. We don\u2019t know if women are biologically more susceptible to these injuries,\u201d she said, adding that some research suggests the size and musculature of women\u2019s necks could play a part. Kelly  Before becoming a track cyclist, Catlin, a triplet, was a national champion road cyclist and time trial national champion, her father Mark, told CNN. After winning a Canadian international race at 17 she was invited to an Olympic training camp for a try out, where, impressed by her performance numbers, coaches immediately offered her a position on the track pursuit team.  Catlin\u2019s father, Mark, told CNN, that his daughter was \u201cintense\u201d and \u201cambitious,\u201d attributes she channeled into her sporting life. Her life changed irrevocably in January 2019. Practicing fast downhill descents in the hills near Los Angeles, she crashed and went skidding down the road.  Despite suffering road rash, Catlin got back on her bike, and finished the ride. It wasn\u2019t her first crash \u2013 she had experienced 4 or 5 hard crashes before this, her father said, and after the latest, she didn\u2019t have any symptoms at the time.  But soon after, at a World Cup track event in Berlin, Catlin was gripped by a sudden and severe headache.   \u201cShe couldn\u2019t compete,\u201d her father said. \u201cKelly is kind of this stoical individual. And if she\u2019s rolling around on the ground, clutching her head, it has to be a severe thing.\u201d On closer inspection, Catlin\u2019s helmet from LA had dents in it. Her father told CNN that this, coupled with her symptoms, caused her family to become aware she had suffered a concussion, which was later confirmed with a diagnosis from Stanford\u2019s Health Centre.  A concussion is a brain injury which happens after a hit to the head or body causes the brain to move back and forth inside the skull, according to the CDC. When Catlin returned to the US, her father says she was examined by the track training center in Colorado. It was confirmed she suffered a concussion, and a return to training protocol was advised, but not implemented or communicated to her coach, he said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any follow-up from Colorado after this. I believe they assumed she would seek care at Stanford,\u201d he told CNN.  CNN has reached out to Stanford and USA Cycling for comment.  Catlin\u2019s symptoms didn\u2019t improve, and in weekly phone calls with her parents, she admitted she was struggling with schoolwork and was unable to concentrate. Stanford Health Center, having diagnosed Catlin with concussion with ongoing symptoms, recommended that she decrease her training for 2 weeks and then gradually build back up and start sessions with an athletic trainer, medical documents sent to CNN by her father show. She was referred to a concussion specialist, the document adds. She tried to train, but \u201cshe would have to stop because she got a severe headache just from walking,\u201d according to her father. Her heart rate would also accelerate rapidly from even the smallest exertion, leaving her with \u201cno exercise tolerance whatsoever,\u201d he added.  Her injury had other consequences. \u201cAs far as we knew she was never a person that suffered from depression. She had an interesting sense of humor.  She was always upbeat and bubbly about things,\u201d her father told CNN.  \u201cShe basically thought her life was over. She was no longer able to be the athlete that she was, she was failing her teammates. And she wasn\u2019t able to succeed in school now. And I think ultimately, that\u2019s why she took her life, because she thought her life was over,\u201d he added.  At the end of January, Catlin made a serious but non-fatal suicide attempt, and was involuntarily admitted to the locked psychiatric ward at Stanford, her father told CNN. A month after that attempt, she took her own life.     Ellie   Soutter\u2019s father Tony said there were many dimensions to his young daughter \u2013 not only was she an \u201cadrenaline junkie,\u201d but she was \u201cvery conscientious\u201d and excelled in school, even after moving from England to France.   Aged 12, Soutter took up snowboarding at school \u2013 and just months later, she was spotted in her hometown resort of Les Gets and trialed by Team Great Britain in February 2013.  \u201cIt was quite obvious why she kept winning competitions because she just made it easy,\u201d her father said. \u201cShe just made it look graceful and beautiful.\u201d But training took its toll \u2013 Soutter told CNN that his daughter suffered seven major concussions in five years, between 2013 and 2018.  \u201cI was being advised by doctors \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, she\u2019s young enough she\u2019ll bounce back. As she progressed, becoming an elite athlete starting on the World Cup circuit, every time she had another concussion, they got worse, and they took longer to recover from,\u201d he told CNN.     \u201cWith every concussion, with the exception of a few minor knocks, Ellie saw a doctor in person,\u201d he added. \u201cI was always told that she was young enough to bounce back to full health after each case and therefore never consulted with the doctors that I met, about any previous concussions.\u201d But Soutter\u2019s final concussion was so \u201chuge\u201d that she spent two nights in the hospital. \u201cWhen I got there, she didn\u2019t even know who I was or where she was,\u201d her father said. Soutter was then selected for the Junior Snowboard World Championships in New Zealand August 2018.  But a month before the competition, she died by suicide.  Her father said a neurologist conducted a CT scan of her brain and reaction tests three months after her final concussion, but said she was \u201cabsolutely fine\u201d and could continue competing.                                                                                                                                 Like Catlin, Soutter had issues with studying and concentrating, becoming more insular as she suffered from crippling headaches. She also started suffering from insomnia.  \u201cShe would literally sit with the tutor a good month after a concussion, and suddenly, she\u2019d go blind. She\u2019d not be able to see \u2013 everything would go black and dark,\u201d her father said. After missing a flight to snowboard training, Soutter died by suicide on her 18th birthday. Team GB referred CNN to GB Snowsport when approached for comment, adding that Ellie only competed for Team GB at one event.  In order to represent Britain in international competitions, GB Snowsport says athletes or their coaches are required to demonstrate that the athlete has reached established performance criteria, is of the relevant technical ability to compete, and has appropriate medical clearance to compete. A large number of athletes can represent Britain at different levels of international competition but are not part of a programme delivered and overseen by GB Snowsport.  \u201cAs Ellie was not part of the GB Snowsport programme, we were unable to implement a personalised recovery and management programme for Ellie,\u201d a spokesperson for GB Snowsport told CNN in an email. \u201cShe was, however, covered by national policies and protocols around fitness to compete, and would not have been cleared for any activity \u2013 training or competition \u2013 overseen by GB Snowsport without being able to demonstrate appropriate medical sign-off,\u201d they added. The spokesperson for GB Snowsport told CNN: \u201cWe take concussions and head injuries incredibly seriously, and in reviewing contemporaneous records from the time that Ellie was involved in snowsport we are confident that GB Snowsport staff applied and followed every appropriate process.\u201d Catlin and Soutter aren\u2019t the only young sporting women whose lives have been cut short in this way. After 29-year-old Australian rules football player Jacinda Barclay took her life in 2020, post-mortem research by scientists found that she had degradation to her cerebral white matter unusual for someone her age.  \u201cFor someone her age, you would expect to see lovely pristine white matter, and hers looked like she was an old woman in that it was basically degraded,\u201d Michael Buckland, founder and Executive Director of the Australian Sports Brain Bank, who studied Barclay\u2019s brain, told CNN.  \u201cWe haven\u2019t gone back and done specific white matter studies on our donors,\u201d he told CNN, adding that the bank hasn\u2019t done peer reviewed research on this.  \u201cBut what struck me, just as someone that sees a lot of brains \u2013 this is not normal for someone of that age.\u201d  Damage to white matter has been associated with dementia, according to research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.   Opportunities missed Suicide after concussion is rare. However patients diagnosed with concussion or mild traumatic brain injury had double the risk of suicide and a higher risk of suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts than people without brain injuries, a 2018 study from researchers at the University of Harvard published in JAMA Neurology found. Dr. Robert Cantu, clinical professor of neurology at the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at Boston University School of Medicine told CNN that there are several theories as to why incidence of suicide is higher in people who have suffered concussion. One theory, he explained, is that those suffering from persistent post-concussion symptoms may have structural or functional brain damage and could be experiencing \u201cbehavioral dysregulation: short fuse, irritability, [and] can\u2019t suppress impulses the way you normally could.\u201d   With these emotional problems, \u201cthey would be more prone to perhaps do something impulsive, like commit suicide,\u201d Cantu, medical director of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, told CNN. A second theory, Cantu noted, is that post-concussive symptoms prevent people from getting back into their sport and stop them \u201cfrom being the person that they were before their injury.\u201d Neither theory is proven to the exclusion of the other, Cantu said, adding he thinks increased suicidality was \u201ca combined factor involving both in many, if not most cases.\u201d There are also differences in the way brain injuries affect women.  A study of female soccer players across US high schools found they are nearly twice as likely to suffer concussion as their male counterparts, according to research that looked at over 80,000 adolescent athletes, published in the journal JAMA Network Open.  Women remain significantly underrepresented within sport and exercise science research: a 2021 study examining papers from some of the most influential sports medical journals found that only 6% of the studies were solely focused on women, compared with 31% of studies that included just men. Other researchers have pointed to female sex hormones, with risk of concussion changing with hormone levels during a menstrual cycle.  McKee said all athletes can also experience \u201cnon-concussive\u201d injuries: \u201chits to the head that can be of the same magnitude as concussion, but they don\u2019t rise to the level of symptoms for whatever reason, so a player tends to play right through it.\u201d Cumulative exposure to repetitive head impacts \u2013 including concussion and non- concussive injuries \u2013 increases the risk for the neurodegenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known as CTE, McKee said.  The disease, which can only be formally diagnosed with an autopsy, has mostly been seen in either veterans or people who played contact sports, particularly American football, say researchers. The disease occurs when the brain starts to degenerate likely due to repeated head traumas, according to the Mayo Clinic, which notes CTE is \u201cassociated with recurrent concussions.\u201d But scientists aren\u2019t only concerned about concussions.  Previous studies have shown subconcussive head impacts \u2013 repetitive hits to the head and body that do not cause symptoms \u2013 can still result in long-term neurological disease.   According to The Concussion Legacy Foundation, \u201cthe best available evidence suggests that subconcussive impacts, not concussions, are the driving force behind CTE.\u201d There have been cases of CTE discovered in athletes who have never been diagnosed with a concussion, according to the Concussion Legacy Foundation. And other changes in the brain after repetitive head impacts aside from CTE are likely \u201cequally important,\u201d McKee said. \u201cWe also see damage to the white matter. And that appears to be mostly in the frontal lobe, but also in the temporal lobes,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to understand the relationship of those white matter changes to behavioral and mood symptoms, perhaps even suicidality,\u201d she said.  McKee stressed that concussion management is important, but physicians and athletes should also be aware of other injuries. \u201cThe problem is the subclinical hits \u2013 the non-concussive injuries that aren\u2019t detected, you don\u2019t pull the player off the field \u2013 and they can be in the hundreds or even the 1000s in a single season,\u201d she explained. Lack of research  Though a growing body of data suggests women in sport are more likely to sustain a concussion, have more severe symptoms, and to take longer to recover, most sports-related concussions protocols are based on data from men.  In a review in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers looked at 171 concussion studies written since 1967 which are used to inform the most influential consensus and position statements in treating sports-related concussions. Clinicians rely on these documents to guide their medical practice when treating athletes \u2013 but most of the studies are focused on men. Only 1% of them was looking exclusively at concussions in women and 40% of them didn\u2019t have any women in a sample of participants at all.   There is another risk factor for women in sport when they sustain head injuries, Katherine Snedaker, founder and executive director of PINK Concussions, a non-profit dedicated to women\u2019s health and brain injury, told CNN.  There is a gulf of millions of dollars separating women and men when it comes to average annual salaries in most professional sports. Outside of elite sport, Snedaker says, female athletes often don\u2019t have access to the same medical care as men, meaning head injuries aren\u2019t spotted as routinely.   \u201cThey tend to push really hard through the injury,\u201d she said. And many women can\u2019t afford to take time out to recover: even professional athletes will supplement their sports income with other jobs, she added, and many are caregivers. \u201cWhen they really crater, it\u2019s a couple of days or weeks later.\u201d  Snedaker said female athletes often weren\u2019t aware they had suffered a head injury. If they were, she said, there were no appropriate medical or sporting staff to inform. Not enough support The families of Catlin and Soutter feel the young women didn\u2019t get enough support after their injuries. After Catlin\u2019s first suicide attempt, she was released from an involuntary admission to the psychiatric ward after threatening legal action, and a conference between psychiatrists, her coach and her parents.  She attended therapy sessions, which she agreed to attend during the conference, but found \u201cthey were geared toward suicidal freshman with a whole set of different issues than an elite Olympic athlete,\u201d her father told CNN. She got a referral to a sports psychologist that worked with the Stanford athletic department, but the department forbade the psychologist from seeing Catlin because she was not a varsity athlete, her father added.  She contacted the office of a sports psychologist with whom she had developed a rapport while in the hospital \u2013 but, his appointment secretary said he had no openings for six months, her father told CNN.  \u201cWherever she turned she could not find help,\u201d he said, adding that his daughter tried a suicide hotline several times: she was once put on hold and once received no answer. Catlin described his daughter as a \u201cstoic, female warrior type person that isn\u2019t going to admit that she\u2019s struggling.\u201d  \u201cShe needed a sports psychiatrist that really could understand what she was going through and understand the rigors of her life in terms of preparation for competitions and the athletic side of it and what it could potentially do to you.\u201d Her father said a major factor in his daughter\u2019s death was \u201ca lack of communication between the facilities that were involved in Kelly\u2019s care. No one was in charge and they assumed the other institutions were following up when they weren\u2019t,\u201d he added. In a statement sent to CNN, Luisa Rapport, director of emergency communications and media relations at Stanford University did not address any of the specific allegations made by Catlin\u2019s family.  She said while the university does not discuss in the media the details of individual students\u2019 experiences, \u201csupporting the mental and emotional health of students is a critical priority for Stanford.\u201d  \u201cStudents in need of mental health crisis assistance \u2013 including students having suicidal thoughts \u2013 and those who are concerned about students in need of assistance, can contact the University\u2019s Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) 24 hours-a-day, seven days-a-week,\u201d she added. Rapport said that in addition to this, \u201cthere are multiple places where psychological services may be provided for students depending on individualized need and treatment recommendations, including, for example, affiliated hospital services and clinics through Stanford\u2019s Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, and mental health programs and clinicians in the community.\u201d In a statement sent to CNN, USA Cycling said it was \u201cdevastated\u201d by Catlin\u2019s death, adding: \u201cShe brought focus and determination to everything she did, and served as an inspiration to everyone who knew her.  \u201cAs the National Governing Body for the sport of cycling, USA Cycling prioritizes the holistic wellbeing of the riders on the U.S. National Team and has a longstanding commitment to providing both physical and mental health resources to members of the team,\u201d a representative for USA Cycling added.   After his daughter Ellie\u2019s death, Soutter was contacted by the UNITE Brain Bank, who wanted to study her brain as part of their research into CTE. But even in that facility \u2013 the biggest of its kind in the world \u2013 of some 1,300 brains, only 3% belonged to women, Ann McKee, Director of the Boston University Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center told CNN. \u201cWhen I actually started looking into CTE \u2013 all of the work that they\u2019ve done with the footballers in America, she had every single symptom and more,\u201d Soutter told CNN. \u201cIt was quite obvious to me that there was a definite link in her starting to get into dark places and feeling bad and anxious and not sleeping properly. All of those symptoms \u2026 Every one that\u2019s involved in CTE was part of Ellie\u2019s life,\u201d he added. \u201cI truly believe today that my daughter would be alive had I had any inkling, you know, even the smallest bit of information.\u201d Editor\u2019s Note: If you are in the US and you or a loved one have contemplated suicide, call The National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255) to connect with a trained counselor.

It\u2019s Murray\u2019s first tour-level victory since he ruptured ankle ligaments at the Miami Open in March, with the 37-year-old also recently dealing with a back injury. When asked during his on-court interview how his body was feeling, Murray replied to laughs from the crowd: \u201cI\u2019ve felt better.\u201d \u201cBut it was enough today. I didn\u2019t realize, but my mom told me before the match that it was my 1,000th match on tour, so a lot of matches, a lot of wear and tear on the body and it\u2019s not easy, but I managed to push through it. \u201cObviously, during the match, it\u2019s difficult, but great reward at the end for the hard work and effort I put into the match. \u201cI\u2019ve not got too many wins this year.

Lionel Messi broke an appearance record which had stood for over 70 years by playing in his 35th Copa Am\u00e9rica match, and was at the heart of Argentina\u2019s goals from Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez and Lautaro Mart\u00ednez. Canada, appearing in this expanded edition of the Copa Am\u00e9rica for the first time, was a heavy underdog against the 15-time champion but did squander several promising opportunities to get on the scoresheet. \u201cThis team creates scoring opportunities and defends like lions,\u201d Argentina manager Lionel Scaloni said after the match. \u201cYesterday, I said that Canada was going to be a difficult opponent and it was a good test for us. The important thing is that the team always responds, no matter what the game is like.\u201d Both teams had chances in a lively first half played in front of more than 70,000 fans. \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda couldn\u2019t finish a one-on-one as Argentina counter-attacked from a corner, while Alexis Mac Allister saw his header saved by Canadian goalkeeper Maxime Cr\u00e9peau. Canada\u2019s best chance of the half fell to Stephen Eust\u00e1quio, but his headed effort was saved by Emi Mart\u00ednez before Alphonso Davies missed the follow-up. It was Argentina, however, which took the lead early in the second period. Messi picked out Mac Allister with an excellent pass, and though the Liverpool midfielder couldn\u2019t get a shot away, tangling awkwardly with Cr\u00e9peau, he did set up \u00c1lvarez for the opening goal. Messi had two scoring chances when he found himself in behind the Canadian defense, but on the first occasion he was denied by Cr\u00e9peau and Derek Cornelius\u2019 rear-guard efforts, and on the second his shot crept past the left-hand post. Jonathan David missed an open header \u2013 perhaps Canada\u2019s best chance of the match \u2013 in between Messi\u2019s two breakaways, before Argentina finished off the contest with a superb team goal. Brilliant build-up play enabled Messi to find Mart\u00ednez, who slotted a shot through the legs of Cr\u00e9peau to make it 2-0.

{"id": "2024_05_08_sport_chris-birch-nasa-astronaut-cycling-spt-scn-intl", "text": "Scroll through the athlete profiles on the USA Cycling website and you\u2019ll find someone whose favorite movie is listed as \u201cInterstellar\u201d \u2013 Christopher Nolan\u2019s acclaimed sci-fi adventure released in 2014. \u201cI love realistic space movies \u2026 I\u2019m definitely a nerd,\u201d reads Chris Birch\u2019s answer on her profile page. That response proved prescient: shortly after stepping away from her professional cycling career, the Arizona native was selected from more than 12,000 applicants to join NASA\u2019s astronaut class of 2021. As career sidesteps go, it was an unusual one, though Birch had an extensive background in science with degrees in mathematics, biochemistry and molecular biophysics, and a doctorate in biological engineering. The further she progressed with her application to join NASA, the more convinced she became that she had a future in spaceflight. Interviews with panels of current and former astronauts, she thought, were stimulating, not intimidating, and so too were the selection exercises undertaken with other candidates. \u201cI really just had a blast,\u201d Birch tells CNN Sport. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like an interview at all, it didn\u2019t feel like a test. It was just super fun. And it felt like fun and games for me.\u201d It\u2019s now been close to two and a half years since Birch joined NASA, and in that time, she has practiced for space walks, learned to fly T-38 training jets and developed skills needed to operate the robotic arm on the International Space Station. Her training also involved acquiring expeditionary skills, understanding how to operate the complex systems on the space station, and even becoming proficient in Russian, the language needed to fly the Soyuz spacecraft. When she graduated at Houston\u2019s Johnson Space Center in March, the 37-year-old had few qualms about the unexpected U-turn her career had taken, her appetite for spaceflight keener than ever before. \u201cI absolutely would love to explore off this planet,\u201d says Birch. \u201cI think there\u2019s a pretty good shot that I\u2019ll get to go do science aboard the International Space Station, maybe even get to do some wrenching outside and work on making some upgrades. \u201cIt would be an absolute career highlight to be able to go back to the moon as part of one of the Artemis missions and do science on the moon.\u201d Birch left academia in 2018 to pursue a career in professional cycling, going on to win 11 national titles and represent the US at the world championships on several occasions. It was around the time that she was training to make the team for the postponed Tokyo Olympics that Birch applied to join NASA, and when she missed out on selection for the Games, she decided to throw herself wholly into her new pursuit. Despite the evident differences in cycling and spaceflight, she believes that the same sense of curiosity and wonder has motivated her in both disciplines. \u201cI think there\u2019s something really powerful about being surrounded by a group of people that are all trying deliberately to not walk the path most trodden,\u201d says Birch. \u201cWe\u2019re all looking to push the envelope in some way, and that has always been my driving mantra. The whole reason I pursued a PhD is I wanted to discover something, to build something that had never been done before. \u201cMy fascination with sport was all about seeing how fast we could go. Can we push the human body \u2013 my body, my mind \u2013 farther than I thought I could go? It really was a natural extension of that inner drive for me, if not a slight change in the technical topics.\u201d Joining NASA has meant that Birch\u2019s days of flying around a velodrome at lightning-bolt speeds are over, but her desire to test her physical limits remains. She has turned her focus towards endurance challenges, completing the iconic Leadville Trail 100 mountain bike race \u2013 a 100-mile course with 12,000 feet of elevation gain in Colorado \u2013 last year, as well as racing the Houston Marathon in January. On her radar is an attempt to break the women\u2019s time record for cycling north to south across Montana, some 400 miles on gravel roads. Challenges like that are not so far removed from astronaut training, which involves group expeditions in the field, living in the wilderness for days at a time and learning how to handle stress in a critical, unforgiving environment. \u201cCycling in particular \u2013 it just supports so much suffering,\u201d says Birch. \u201cIt\u2019s a really great avenue to practice mental toughness. It doesn\u2019t cost much, versus for me to go out and fly in a multi-engine jet aircraft is thousands of dollars an hour. \u201cThis is something that I can go do and practice that toughness training, especially if I\u2019m descending on a mountain bike trail, six hours in and I\u2019m really tired \u2013 I\u2019m now making critical handling decisions in response to my environment. \u201cI feel like that translates really well to being able to do that in the jet \u2013 it\u2019s the same mental clarity, mental focus you have to maintain. I think it\u2019s an awesome space to practice that.\u201d Birch is now firmly focused on her first projects since graduating. Recently, that\u2019s involved supporting Artemis II recovery training in the Pacific Ocean, off the coast from California. The Artemis II mission, now scheduled for September 2025 after a delay of several months, aims to send four astronauts on a journey to fly by the moon, and being able to prepare for the safe recovery of the astronauts and the capsule, Birch says, gave an \u201cincredible appreciation for the needs of the crew,\u201d even while she\u2019s still a rookie. There\u2019s no obvious timeline or pathway for when or how she might be able to venture away from planet Earth herself, but it remains a firm ambition in her life and career. \u201cI\u2019m going to prepare for that the same way I would prepare for a race,\u201d says Birch, \u201cshow up every day and give 100% to the team. If the timing works out, then that\u2019s great. But I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/sport/chris-birch-nasa-astronaut-cycling-spt-scn-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Florida rallied to cut the deficit to 4-3 early in the third period, but could never muster a tying goal. In the waning seconds of the game, Edmonton star Connor McDavid iced the win with an empty netter, his second goal of the night. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go to Florida and do a job, and drag them back to Alberta,\u201d McDavid said prior to the game. The Oilers, who appeared destined for disappointment after falling behind in the series three games to none, are now very much alive and have the momentum as the scene shifts back to Edmonton. With a win at home on Friday, the Oilers would push the series to a decisive Game 7. The Oilers have now won two games in a row after the Panthers held a 3-1 advantage. History has been on the Panthers\u2019 side. Four times in NHL postseason history has a team come back to win a series after falling behind 0-3, but it has only happened once in the Stanley Cup Final - more than 80 years ago when the Toronto Maple Leafs rallied to defeat the Detroit Red Wings in 1942.

The villa and grounds had security cameras and police have not made any arrests yet, according to local police. \u201cFirst of all, my family and I would like to thank everyone for the great affection we have received,\u201d Baggio told ANSA in a statement. \u201cAnything can happen in situations like this, and, fortunately, the violence I suffered only caused a few stitches, bruises and a lot of fear.\u00a0Now, I have to overcome the fear.\u201d Luca Zaia, the president of Italy\u2019s Veneto region, said in a statement published by local media: \u201cI express my closeness and solidarity to Roberto Baggio and his family, and I am sure I can send him the embrace of all the Venetians who made people dream with his unparalleled skill on the grass of international pitches. \u201cI hope that the \u2018Divine Codino\u2019 [the \u2018Divine Ponytail\u2019], the symbolic champion of our football and our region, a person we feel close and friendly, can soon recover together with his family from this bad evening and from the wounds for which he was followed and treated by the staff of the health facilities in Arzignano with whom I have kept in touch.\u201d Zaia added: \u201cThe experience he lived in his home, attacked and robbed by unspeakable criminals, compares his to other families who have unfortunately suffered similar experiences and, as in all cases, we trust that the criminals can be brought to justice soon.\u201d Baggio \u2013 who played for Juventus, AC Milan, Inter Milan and the Italian national team among others \u2013 retired in 2004 and runs a small agricultural business on his expansive villa in Altavilla Vicentina, according to local media. He practices Buddhism and owns a modest vehicle, according to press reports and his social media.

{"id": "2024_06_19_sport_matthew-briggs-premier-league-history-spt-intl", "text": "Matthew Briggs was still at school when he made soccer history, becoming the youngest player to feature in the English Premier League. The teenage sensation was just 16 years and 65 days old when he made his debut in arguably the toughest league in the world, coming on as a second-half substitute for Fulham in a 3-1 win in 2007. That \u201csurreal moment\u201d seemingly was the start of an exciting career in the game \u2013 Briggs was once tipped as a future England captain. Instead it was the beginning of a tumultuous journey which hit rock bottom as he stood on the edge of a hotel balcony in Dubai. \u201cI had pushed myself from my family and my friends. I felt like I had nobody,\u201d Briggs tells CNN Sport, reflecting on how he felt in 2018. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018What\u2019s the point? I might as well just end it all now because all that I\u2019m feeling will stop.\u2019\u201d Bright beginnings Briggs was one of the country\u2019s most exciting young talents as a teenager and he progressed quickly through the youth ranks. He was bigger, faster and stronger than his peers, meaning he would regularly play in the older age groups. If he was growing up in the US, he jokes, he would have been the \u201cjock.\u201d He joined Fulham\u2019s academy but was always being tracked by some of England\u2019s biggest clubs, namely the likes of Arsenal. It was at this time, with Briggs weighing up his options, that Fulham fast-tracked him to the first-team for the last game of the 2006/07 season. Briggs was rewarded with a cameo appearance, coming on for the last 13 minutes against Middlesborough to write his name into the record books. \u201cWhen I made my debut, I was instantly thinking I\u2019m the next Wayne Rooney, as any kid would,\u201d Briggs says, referring to the former Premier League star. \u201cEveryone started looking at me like a superstar, like a famous person, when I didn\u2019t feel like that myself.\u201d After making his first senior appearance, Briggs had assumed he would be part of the first-team\u2019s plans the following season. Instead, he was sent back to the youth team, a decision which knocked his confidence. \u201cI started feeling stuff that I\u2019d never done before,\u201d he says. \u201cOverthinking game situations, thinking I\u2019m going to have a bad game, just constantly doubting myself all the time.\u201d They were feelings that Briggs bottled up, as many of his peers did, nervous to expose any potential weakness at such a pivotal moment in his young career. Downward spiral The teenager was almost living a double life. To those on the outside, Briggs was still full of confidence, still the next best thing, still \u201cthe man.\u201d But things on the pitch were not getting better. He spent time away from Fulham on loan at other clubs but nothing really worked out. He eventually left the club in 2014 having made just 13 Premier League appearances in the seven years since making his debut. Briggs began slipping down the divisions, hampered by injuries, low confidence and a worsening struggle with mental health. He suddenly found himself playing in non-league, a level he never imagined he would ever be at. A sense of lost potential and the misplaced feeling of letting people down was the final straw, and Briggs eventually \u201cexploded.\u201d He stopped playing soccer for a year in 2018, turning to alcohol and drugs in search of the feeling he once had playing in front of thousands of spectators. \u201cWhere else can I find this adrenaline? Where else can I go and be the man? It was in the clubs,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was going out partying because I knew, if I go out, people are going to recognize me and I know who I am and I\u2019m going to feel like the man again.\u201d It got to the point where Briggs began using substances to self-medicate his struggles with anxiety and depression, looking for anything to numb the pain. He could no longer watch soccer, unable to deal with the thought of what could have been. \u2018Who am I if I\u2019m not a footballer?\u2019 The partying took him to vacation in Dubai, where he was also searching for a club to start playing for. But he kept hearing rejections and everything became too much. It left him on his hotel balcony, contemplating whether life was still worth living. \u201cI was so used to hearing, \u2018Yes, yes, yes,\u2019 every single club in the country wanting Matthew Briggs,\u201d he says. \u201cIt got to the point where I felt like I was a nobody. Who am I if I\u2019m not a footballer?\u201d Fortunately, he says hotel security saw him and moved him to a room on the lower floor. It\u2019s a moment Briggs says he often thinks about and is now so grateful to those who stopped him from stepping off. In the year when he walked away from soccer, Briggs moved in with his uncle. While he remembers some dark days when he would just sit in a room with his thoughts, he also credits that period with turning his life around. His uncle found him some work on a building site, where Briggs helped out with construction. The job helped rebuild his confidence but also served as a warning shot. He wanted more from life, and it motivated him to get back into the game he loved. He started therapy, leaning on the resources offered by the Professional Footballers Association (PFA) \u2013 a union for all current and former players. For the first time in his life, Briggs learned how to deal with the feelings he had struggled with for years. He allowed himself to feel vulnerable and slowly began building his life back. He also started \u201cbegging\u201d former clubs for another chance. He eventually signed for another non-league side and had \u201cone of the best seasons I\u2019ve ever had in my career.\u201d While he was clearly too good for that level, the experience allowed Briggs to fall in love with the sport all over again. While never receiving a call up to the England senior team \u2013 Briggs did play for the England youth sides \u2013 he had previously played internationally for Guyana in 2015. After a four-year hiatus, he managed to persuade the national team to also give him another chance. In 2019, Briggs made the squad for Guyana\u2019s CONCACAF Gold Cup campaign and relished the opportunity. He was back playing in front of major crowds and lined up against the US men\u2019s team, Panama and Trinidad & Tobago. While Guyana finished bottom of the group \u2013 picking up its first ever Gold Cup point in the process \u2013 Briggs impressed and was scouted by Danish side HB K\u00f8ge. It offered him a ticket back to playing professional soccer \u2013 a moment that still fills him with immense pride. \u201cI\u2019ve gone from not playing football at all anymore, feeling suicidal, to then getting myself back into the game and managing to get myself back to playing professionally,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter that, I then became captain of my country. For me, that\u2019s probably my proudest moment because it shows that it\u2019s never too late to start again.\u201d \u2018Victim of my own success\u2019 Having retired from soccer in 2023 following a string of injuries, Briggs struggled with the prospect of what would come next. He once again leaned on support which helped him discover a passion for helping young players in the game today. He is now back at Fulham, where his odyssey began, working with academy players and providing support to young stars who are starting to forge a career in the game. Teaching teenagers to communicate their worries and fears \u2013 something Briggs only learned later in life \u2013 is one of the main focuses of his work, as well as fostering an environment where people feel safe being vulnerable. \u201cI was probably a victim of my own success. I went up to the first team and kind of got lost in that environment. \u201cWhereas now, when young players do achieve what they deserve and go with the first team, we make sure we keep that connection with them.\u201d Briggs is fully aware his story isn\u2019t entirely unique. Thousands of young players are fed into the academy system every year, with only a tiny percentage ever making it. He says the support and pastoral care is now \u201chead and shoulders\u201d above what he experienced as a child. For example, in 2012, the Elite Player Performance Plan (EPPP) was launched by the English Premier League and offered clubs more guidance around player care. \u201cEnsuring that the Academy experience is a life-enriching one for every young player is a key part of taking a broader view of success,\u201d Neil Saunders, the Premier League\u2019s director of football, said in 2022. \u201cNot just judging the success of the system by those players that go on and play in the first team, but also what destination those players go on to have beyond playing.\u201d There is also support offered by the PFA \u2013 a service which Briggs leant on during his career. \u201cWe encourage players to seek help and use the resources available to them. The PFA has empathetic, experienced professionals and extensive provisions to assist players in navigating challenges both inside and outside the game,\u201d the PFA said in a statement. Finding peace Briggs held the Premier League record for the youngest player for 12 years, before it was broken by current Liverpool star Harvey Elliot, who was also handed his debut by Fulham in 2019. The record was broken again by Arsenal\u2019s Ethan Nwaneri in 2022. Briggs has since described Elliot breaking his record as a \u201cbittersweet\u201d moment. On one hand, he was sad to lose such a prestigious accolade but, on the other, he felt the pressure lift from his shoulders. Now, he says he wants to use his story to \u201chelp, motivate and inspire others.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/sport/matthew-briggs-premier-league-history-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "sports"}}

Having elected to bowl first, the USA were pegged back by some aggressive batting from South Africa, with the Proteas finishing their 20 overs on 194 runs. And although there were some promising glimpses from the USA batting order, they fell short of South Africa\u2019s score by 18 runs. Despite the defeat, the USA\u2019s remarkable run at the tournament \u2013 it\u2019s the country\u2019s debut at the T20 World Cup \u2013 is not over, with games against the West Indies and England still to come in the Super 8 stage. The eight teams who qualified from the group stages for the Super 8 round of the T20 World Cup are split into two sections where they will play one another in a round-robin format, with the top two countries advancing to the semifinal stage. South Africa\u2019s win over the USA was the Super 8 round\u2019s opening game. All 12 games in the Super 8 stage are being played across four Caribbean islands \u2013 Antigua, Barbados, St. Lucia and St. Vincent. New steps The USA have been one of the talking points of the T20 World Cup so far, thanks to its shock victory over Pakistan and close defeat by India. But in the Super 8 stage, there is a step-up in quality with only the best teams earning the right to progress. And it was something the USA experienced first-hand from the outset in Antigua, with South Africa starting in strong fashion as opening batter Quinton de Kock aggressively took on the USA\u2019s bowlers. The 31-year-old de Kock, who is also the team\u2019s wicketkeeper, brought his half century up off just 26 balls inside nine overs, with South Africa scoring over a run a ball. The team reached the 100-run mark before the halfway point of its innings. Having entered the Super 8 stage with a 100% winning record, South Africa continued to pile on the runs before de Kock fell after a brilliant display when he was caught in the deep for 74 off of just 40 balls. It got even better for the USA on the very next ball, with Harmeet Singh catching David Miller off his own bowling as the T20 World Cup debutants clawed their way back into the match. As South Africa attempted to rebuild, the USA kept themselves in touch with more wickets, with Proteas captain Aiden Markram the next to fall for 46 off 32 balls off the bowling of the USA\u2019s breakthrough star Saurabh Netravalkar. Thanks to the batting of Heinrich Klaasen and Tristan Stubbs, however, South Africa was able to finish strongly and post a score of 194, meaning the USA faced the daunting task of needing 195 off their 20 overs to claim a historic victory. In response, the USA started strongly through opening batter Steven Taylor, whose ability to hit big shots discombobulated the South African bowlers in the opening overs. However, Taylor was out as he attempted another big shot off Kagiso Rabada\u2019s bowling, only for his effort to fall short and into Klaasen\u2019s waiting hands. Rabada quickly picked up his second wicket of the match in his next over, with Nitish Kumar this time holing out to Stubbs to dent the USA\u2019s run chase. Captain Aaron Jones was next to fall off the spin bowling of Keshav Maharaj before former New Zealand international Corey Anderson was bowled emphatically by Anrich Nortje. The regular fall of wickets stunted any real hopes the USA had of reaching South Africa\u2019s total, despite an impressive half-century from Andries Gous. And they were never able to recover with South Africa eventually able to round out an 18-run victory.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/sport/usa-south-africa-super-8-2024-t20-cricket-world-cup-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_sport_bryson-dechambeau-us-open-win-2024-spt-intl", "text": "American Bryson DeChambeau won his second US Open title on Sunday, edging Rory McIlroy in a nerve-shredding finale at Pinehurst No. 2 in Pinehurst, North Carolina. LIV Golf star DeChambeau carded a final round one-over 71 to finish one stroke ahead of his Northern Irish counterpart at six-under overall and add to his first major victory in 2020. It resigned world No. 3 McIlroy to yet another heartbreaking near-miss as his 10-year wait for a fifth major title continues. The 35-year-old played brilliantly to surge from three shots behind to two ahead of DeChambeau, only to miss two putts from inside four feet across the last two holes. Left needing to close with par to win, DeChambeau held his nerve to triumph and exorcise the demons of falling one stroke short of the PGA Championship to compatriot Xander Schauffele last month. With his victory falling on Father\u2019s Day, an emotional DeChambeau began his winner\u2019s speech by dedicating the trophy to his father Jon, who died in 2022. \u201cFirst off I want to say a Happy Father\u2019s Day to every father out there,\u201d DeChambeau said.\u201cThis one is for him.\u201d It makes the 30-year-old the second golfer after last year\u2019s PGA Championship winner Brooks Koepka to win a major after departing the PGA Tour for LIV Golf. Cameron Smith and Jon Rahm joined the Saudi-backed circuit after their victories at the 2022 Open Championship and 2023 Masters respectively. Once maligned by some fans, DeChambeau \u2013 whose personal YouTube channel continues to amass subscribers \u2013 has become a crowd-favorite at the majors this year and further consolidated that reputation at Pinehurst. The California-born golfer mixed thrilling play with regular fan interaction throughout, wooing fans one final time by delivering on his victor\u2019s speech promise to let them touch the trophy and ferrying it around the throngs gathered at the 18th green. \u201cI just can\u2019t thank you guys enough for all the support this week,\u201d he added to the crowd. \u201cYou guys have meant the world to me. You are the best fans in the world and I can\u2019t thank you enough.\u201d The joyous scenes served as a stark contrast to the agony undoubtedly felt by McIlroy, who declined to speak to media after his final round one-under 69. McIlroy has plugged away at ending his major drought with remarkable consistency since his last triumph at the 2014 Open Championship, finishing inside the top-10 on 20 of his 36 subsequent appearances at the four flagship events, including his last five in a row at the US Open. He has been a major runner-up three times before, his most recent to Wyndham Clark at last year\u2019s tournament, but the fourth has the potential to haunt him the most given the context. Three bogeys and a par across his last four holes, compounded by two horror close-range misses, resigned him to a closing 69. Even one stroke better would ultimately have been enough to force DeChambeau into a playoff. McIlroy had made his previous 496 putts from inside three feet before his miss for par at the 16th, according to the PGA Tour. The curtain falls on the 2024 men\u2019s major calendar with the 152nd Open Championship at Royal Troon in Scotland on July 18, where American Brian Harman will seek to defend the Claret Jug. Scheffler endures rare torrid week Scottie Scheffler\u2019s miserable week ended in another birdie-less round as the world No.1 toiled to a tied-41st finish at eight-over par overall, his worst major performance in two years. Five wins in his previous eight starts \u2013 including last week\u2019s Memorial Tournament \u2013 had seen Scheffler arrive at Pinehurst as the overwhelming favorite yet he struggled to cope with the course\u2019s firm and fast greens, the typically unflappable Texan\u2019s frustrations bubbling over as he narrowly scraped under the cut line Friday. A third round one-over 71 meant Scheffler had shot four consecutive rounds over par for the first time in a professional career spanning 120 PGA Tour events, and the unwanted streak extended to five as he signed off with a 72. April\u2019s Masters champion had gone 168 rounds with at least one birdie before his second round 74, and had not finished outside the top-25 at a major since missing the cut at the 2022 PGA Championship. Both streaks had extended through a tied-eighth finish at last month\u2019s PGA Championship, a result achieved despite his arrest and release from jail during the major. \u201cI couldn\u2019t hole anything. I could not see the break on these greens,\u201d Scheffler, who has since seen all charges against him dismissed, told reporters Sunday. \u201cThe greens this week kind of had my number. I felt like I hit a lot of really good putts that did weird things at the cup that I was not expecting them to do.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been on a good stretch of golf,\u201d he added. \u201cHad one tough event following a great event. I\u2019m not really going to look too much into it but focus more on my prep.\u201d Scheffler finished 12 shots behind his compatriots Tony Finau and Patrick Cantlay, who shared third place at four-under overall, one shot behind McIlroy. France\u2019s Matthieu Pavon finished a further stroke back. Unfamiliar territory A virtuoso third round 67 that was as entertaining as it was excellent had rocketed DeChambeau into the final 18 holes with a plush \u2013 yet unfamiliar \u2013 three shot cushion. The Californian had never before held the 54-hole lead at a major championship. Though he had ultimately cantered to victory at Winged Foot six years ago, he had trailed Matthew Wolff by two strokes ahead of the final round before tearing away from his compatriot down the stretch. DeChambeau said Saturday he was aiming to play \u201cboring golf\u201d to get over the line, and looked to be delivering on his plan as he made a steady \u2013 albeit unspectacular \u2013 start with six pars and a bogey through the opening seven holes. Yet that strategy, and his nerve, soon came under enormous scrutiny. Unlike Wolff four years ago, McIlroy was showing no signs of fading. Far from it \u2013 he was catching fire. The steely-eyed Northern Irishman was making a mockery of the firm and fast greens that had humbled so much of the field across the week. After two birdies from beyond 20 feet, McIlroy lasered in his fourth in a five-hole stretch at the 13th. With DeChambeau bogeying the 12th, McIlroy headed to the next tee box with a two stroke cushion. The picture had changed entirely in less than 20 minutes, yet it took the same amount of time for it to reset as DeChambeau capitalized on a bogey from his rival to draw level just two holes later. It set up a climax that would serve as the ultimate test of nerve and DeChambeau blinked first, a birdie opportunity turning into a bogey as his four-foot par putt lipped out of the 15th cup. Incredibly though, McIlroy would mirror the error from even closer range mere moments later to surrender his lead and set in motion a meltdown to rival his infamous collapse at the Masters in 2011. Yet the minor consolation of that spiral at Augusta National was that victory had all but vanished shortly after he made the turn. This time, the nightmare ran on till to the last two-and-a-half feet, as a simple conversion for par at the 18th green would have forced DeChambeau to birdie to avoid a playoff. There was a glimmer of hope as DeChambeau went from a hook into the native area to a bunker, but the American recovered superbly with a stunning 55-yard approach to within four feet of the cup. Watching anxiously on a clubhouse TV, McIlroy could only watch as DeChambeau safely avoided making the same mistake he did.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/sport/bryson-dechambeau-us-open-win-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_sport_willie-mays-analysis-spt-intl", "text": "When people ask me how good of a player Willie Mays was, I give them a perhaps odd answer. The San Francisco Giants basically gave Mays to the New York Mets for practically nothing in 1972, and a well past his prime 41-year-old Mays was the best overall hitter \u2013 as measured by his ability to get on base and hit for power \u2013 on that solid Mets squad. Of course, the more normal way to know how good Mays was is that he remains, statistically, the best player who played his entire career in the last century and is in the Hall of Fame. But if you truly want to know how great Mays was? You had to watch him play. I couldn\u2019t help thinking of my Father when I learned of Mays\u2019 passing last night on \u201cThe Source.\u201d I mentioned him almost immediately. You see, my Father watched Mays play when he came up as a rookie for the New York Giants in 1951. He considered Mays the best player he ever saw from the moment he laid eyes on him in that inaugural year. Mays supercharged that \u201851 Giants squad and helped them overcome a 13.5-game deficit in mid-August to win the NL pennant over their crosstown rivals, the Brooklyn Dodgers, thanks to the Shot Heard \u2018Round the World. It remains, in my opinion, the greatest comeback in baseball history. Mays won Rookie of the Year that season. It was three years later, however, when Mays became a baseball legend. After serving in the military for over a season, the man nicknamed the \u201cSay Hey Kid\u201d \u2013 who had a great song written about him playing on that name \u2013 dominated the National League. He led the league in batting average, slugging percentage (a measure of power), triples (one of the ultimate measures of speed and power) and on-base plus slugging (OBPS), which combines all of it into one metric. And yet, I don\u2019t think most remember Mays\u2019 1954 MVP season for his offensive exploits; people like my Father remember him for a play he made during Game 1 of the 1954 World Series. Let me set the scene: the game is tied 2-2 in the eighth inning. The Cleveland Indians have runners on first and second with no one out. Cleveland power hitter Vic Wertz is at the plate, and he hits a long fly ball into the truly cavernous center field at the Polo Grounds in New York. Mays, who roamed center field for over 20 seasons, went back more than 400 feet and made a difficult, over-the-shoulder catch seem easy. He then fired the ball back into the infield to ensure that no runs would score. The Giants would go on to win the game and sweep the series in four games. It was their swan song in New York, as they moved to the West Coast after the 1957 season. Mays never understood why people thought that catch was amazing. For him, it was relatively routine. What was unique about this catch, beyond being in the World Series, was that video cameras captured it in an era from which we don\u2019t have many recordings. That short splice of film is our version of getting to see Mays play. It\u2019s our rare glimpse into a man whose defensive prowess was far more than that one catch. Mays was the best defensive player at any position that entire season in the National League, according to advanced statistics. He is, by those same metrics, a top-five defensive outfielder of all time, and those statistics \u2013 given we don\u2019t have a lot of video from the era \u2013 don\u2019t even really take into account his obviously great arm. The fact that I\u2019m talking about the defense of a man who for a long period of time was third all-time in home runs \u2013 and remains sixth \u2013 tells you everything you need to know. Mays wasn\u2019t just defense, though he excelled at that. He wasn\u2019t just about hitting for power, though he excelled at that. He wasn\u2019t just hitting for average, though he excelled at that. He wasn\u2019t just about speed, even though he excelled at that and led the league in stolen bases four times. Mays was everything \u2013 and he was so for over 20 years. Mays was, as my friend and esteemed sports columnist Neil Paine calculated, the most complete ballplayer in history. Baseball fans talk about finding five-tool players \u2013 those who hit for power and average, have speed and defensive abilities in terms of range and arm \u2013 like a miner trying to find gold. Well, we found our gold in Mays. But again, Mays is more than just numbers. He was one of our last links to multiple eras of baseball history. Mays oversaw the expansion of baseball to the West Coast in 1958, when it had previously been played on the Major League level only east of the Mississippi River. He was the first superstar on the West Coast. Mays was also the last superstar with us who made his name playing in New York during the 1950s. It was baseball\u2019s golden era; a time when America came out of World War II with a booming economy and during which baseball continued to outrank football as America\u2019s favorite sport and pastime. And if Mays wasn\u2019t good enough, he actually added a few hits to his storied, record-book career a few weeks ago when Negro League statistics were integrated into the MLB record books. Mays was one of the last living stars who started his career in the Negro Leagues in 1948 for Birmingham Black Barons. I like to joke that Mays was so great that he was still compiling hits at the age of 93. Indeed, he remained a hit with anyone who saw him play. Long after his career was over, Mays \u2013 when he would come back to New York \u2013 lived down the street from us in the Bronx. My Father would see him on walks and knew he had to get his autograph. Mays gave my Dad that autograph, and he kept it in his office until he passed. Mays is a big reason why my Father was one of the few people who wore a New York Giants baseball cap throughout his later years. I bought at least three of them for my Dad because he had one on his head all the time and literally wore them out. It\u2019s a connection I try to carry on to this day whether it\u2019s by wearing a New York Giants baseball hat on television or by answering \u201cthe New York Giants\u201d when asked what baseball team I root for. Now, excuse me as I go try and find that Mays autograph to honor the greatest player anyone I know saw play.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/sport/willie-mays-analysis-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_sport_christian-eriksen-goal-denmark-euro-2024-cardiac-arrest-euro-2020-spt-intl", "text": "Christian Eriksen scored Denmark\u2019s opening goal at Euro 2024 against Slovenia - and it\u2019s one that will likely feel extra special. Just three years ago, Eriksen collapsed on the pitch after suffering cardiac arrest during Denmark\u2019s group match against Finland at Euro 2020, which was delayed by a year due to the Covid-19\u00a0pandemic. The Danish captain received life-saving treatment on the pitch, eventually being resuscitated and taken to hospital. Exactly 1,100 days after the incident, Eriksen produced a brilliant finish to give Denmark the lead against Slovenia, taking Jonas Wind\u2019s clever back-heel on his chest before volleying into the bottom corner. The image of Eriksen celebrating his goal \u2013 a huge grin plastered across his face \u2013 was in stark contrast to the distressing scenes at Euro 2020. That day, his Denmark teammates stood around Eriksen arm-in-arm as he received treatment, trying to shield him from the cameras and supporters in the stands. There was relief around the stadium - and around the world - when a conscious Eriksen waved to the crowd as he was being stretchered off the pitch. \u201cWell, what should I say? He was gone,\u201d Morten Boesen, Denmark\u2019s team doctor, said the following day. \u201cWe did cardiac resuscitation and it was cardiac arrest. How close were we? I don\u2019t know.\u201d After receiving life-saving treatment on the pitch, Eriksen was subsequently fitted with an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) device \u2013 a type of pacemaker intended to prevent fatal cardiac arrests by discharging a jolt to restore regular heart rhythm. Serie A club Inter Milan, whom Eriksen had been contracted to at the time of the incident, told him that he would be allowed to move abroad in order to continue his football career, with the midfielder unable to play in Italy unless the ICD device was removed. Eriksen started training with former club\u00a0Odense Boldklub\u00a0in Denmark, before moving to Brentford on a free transfer in January 2022 and then Manchester United, where he currently plays. Eriksen\u2019s brush with death has made the midfielder remarkably philosophical and reflective  about life and living. \u201cI\u2019ve learned that even after a bad time, there\u2019s always a time after where everything will be different,\u201d Eriksen told CNN Sport\u2019s Amanda Davies after receiving the Comeback of the Year award at the Laureus Sports Awards in Paris last yaer.  \u201cOne of the first quotes I heard was that even if you feel good, you\u2019re going to feel bad, you\u2019re going to feel good again. It\u2019s just going to go up and down \u2013 time is your best friend.\u201d Denmark was unable to build on Eriksen\u2019s goal and thanks to Slovenia defender Erik Jan\u017ea\u2019s deflected shot in the 77th minute, the Group C game ended in a 1-1 draw. Serbia vs. England In Group C\u2019s second game on Sunday, England earned an unconvincing 1-0 win over Serbia thanks to Jude Bellingham\u2019s first-half header. Serbia barely had a touch of the ball inside the opening 10 minutes, struggling to get into the game as England passed the ball between themselves with ease. England was similarly dominant in possession against Iceland in the final friendly before the start of Euro 2024, but an insipid performance ended with the visitor earning a famous victory at Wembley. But Gareth Southgate\u2019s side was playing with an obvious vigor in the early stages against Serbia, snapping into challenges and passing the ball around with purpose. It wasn\u2019t long before England took a deserved lead, as Bellingham timed his late run to perfection to get in front of his defender and head Bukayo Saka\u2019s deflected cross past Predrag Rajkovi\u0107 in the Serbia goal. Bellingham was evidently fired up by his goal. Soon after, the Real Madrid midfielder waved his arms towards the crowd to gee up the England fans after putting the ball out for a throw-in, before barging Filip Kosti\u0107 in the chest as he walked away \u2013 much to the Serbian winger\u2019s annoyance. England was given a warning \u2013 if it needed one \u2013 of just how quickly the game can change when an error from Trent Alexander-Arnold gifted Aleksandar Mitrovi\u0107 possession, but the Al Hilal striker flashed his effort a fraction wide of the post. That hairy moment aside, it was an extremely assured first half from England. Kyle Walker should have made it 2-0 when he was through on goal, but decided to cross the ball when perhaps shooting was the better option. The second half, however, was decidedly less comfortable for England. Serbia began to grow into the game and had England pinned back into its own penalty box for long periods, but a lack of any quality in attack meant clear cut chances were few and far between. Harry Kane had the best chance of the second half but his header was brilliantly tipped onto the crossbar by Rajkovi\u0107, who celebrated his save as though he had won Euro 2024 England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford had to be alert in the closing stages to turn Du\u0161an Vlahovi\u0107 vicious long-range strike over the bar, but that was the closest Serbia got to an equalizer. The Three Lions are rarely swashbuckling in tournament football but Southgate will have plenty to think about after that second-half performance before his team faces Denmark on Thursday. There had been security concerns ahead of the game. On Saturday, there were chants of \u201910 German bombers\u2019 \u2013 a reference to World War II \u2013 from some England supporters in D\u00fcsseldorf on Saturday, with journalist Matt Lawton posting a video that showed one fan holding an inflatable plane outside of a pub. There were also clashes between Serbia and England fans as they made their way to the stadium on Sunday. Gelsenkirchen police said in a statement that around 4,000 Serbian fans marched towards the Veltins-Arena in a \u201clargely peaceful\u201d manner, but had to be stopped \u201cseveral times along the way because pyrotechnics were set off.\u201d \u201cAt around 3:45 p.m., the police were informed of a confrontation between Serbian and English football fans in the area of Arminstrasse,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cRiot police officers separated the two fan camps. They took seven Serbian supporters into custody and filed a criminal complaint for grievous bodily harm. \u201cThere were no further incidents on the way to the arena. There is a lively atmosphere around the stadium. The police are on site and are keeping an eye on the situation.\u201d There were more positive chants from England fans in the Arena AufSchalke during Sunday\u2019s game, notably when they erupted into a rendition of The Beatles\u2019 \u201cHey Jude,\u201d celebrating the 20-year-old\u2019s goal, while after the final whistle was blown \u201cSweet Caroline\u201d \u2013\u00a0another fan anthem \u2013 echoed around the stadium.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/sport/christian-eriksen-goal-denmark-euro-2024-cardiac-arrest-euro-2020-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_sport_paris-olympics-seine-triathlon-bacteria-intl", "text": "A reference point for Parisians and tourists alike, the River Seine will be the crown jewel of the Olympics this summer, staging events such as the triathlon as well as the opening ceremony, which for the first time in Olympic history will not be taking place in a stadium. Starting at Pont Alexandre III Bridge, the individual triathlon races are set to begin with a 1.5-kilometer swim, followed by a 40K bike race \u2013 passing by the Le Grand Palais and Champs-Elys\u00e9es \u2013 before finishing with a 10K run through the heart of the city. A mixed team relay race involving four athletes \u2013 two men and two women \u2013 will also start at Pont Alexandre III Bridge with each team member completing a 300-meter swim, followed by a 5.8K bike ride and 1.8K run. If all goes to plan, it will be a historic moment, given that swimming in the Seine has been illegal for more than 100 years due to the river\u2019s pollution levels, though some swimming has been permitted recently as part of triathlon test events. But some are warning that there are still potential dangers lurking below the river\u2019s shimmery surface. Recent testing results shared with CNN by technology company Fluidion show that the Seine is still not safe for swimming as per the standards set by World Triathlon, due to high E. Coli bacteria levels in the water, potentially exposing athletes to serious health risks. Authorities have spent at least \u20ac1.4 billion ($1.55 billion) to clean up the Seine. Last month, a rainwater storage facility was opened that can hold 20 Olympic swimming pools worth of water to reduce pressure on the sewage network and lower the risk of wastewater being discharged into the Seine, according to a statement from Paris 2024. Meanwhile, triathlon teams around the world are preparing for the worst and hoping for the best. \u201cFor me, it will be very frustrating and very shaming for France, Paris and the Olympics if we can\u2019t do a triathlon,\u201d French-born triathlete Jeanne Lehair told CNN in a telephone interview. What does the latest testing show? The city of Paris is working with its own laboratory to monitor the Olympic Seine site, but technology company Fluidion, founded in Paris in 2012, has also been checking the water quality of the river several times a week at Pont Alexandre III Bridge. The Seine serves as Fluidion\u2019s primary research site, according to the company, hence why they routinely collect water samples for internal research efforts. CNN has not independently verified the organization\u2019s findings. Fluidion\u2019s testing has found that, on average, E. Coli levels in the Siene between early April\u00a0and late May were just under 3400 MPN/100mL. According to CNN\u2019s calculation, this is more than three times higher than the level needed for \u201cgood\u201d water quality, as per World Triathlon standards. \u201cWe have experienced a very rainy past couple of months, causing numerous combined sewer overflows in Paris and upstream,\u201d Dan Angelescu, CEO of Fluidion, told CNN on May 31 via email, adding that the impact on water quality is evident, with \u201cnoticeable bacterial spikes following storm events.\u201d Nearly all of France has seen 120 to 200% of normal rainfall over the past three months, with numerous episodes of flooding across portions of the country, especially the north, according to M\u00e9t\u00e9o France. The highest E. Coli levels recorded by Fluidion were 23590 MPN/100mL on May 2 and 13090 MPN/100mL on May 30, according to Angelescu. The May 2 result is more than 20 times higher than World Triathlon\u2019s \u201cgood quality\u201d level, according to CNN\u2019s calculation. More recently, following several days of dry and sunny weather, E. Coli levels on Monday 6 June were 2280 MPN/100mL, according to Angelescu, better than previous results but still above acceptable levels for swimming. If E. Coli levels remain this high, the swimming leg of the triathlon will have to be cancelled, according to World Triathlon competition rules, unless the organization\u2019s medical committee decides that the race can go ahead. Does Paris 2024 have a plan B? Earlier in June, World Triathlon told CNN in an email that the first contingency plan would be to delay the race by one day. But if poor water quality persisted, the triathlon would have to be downgraded to a duathlon with no swimming, the organization confirmed. Angelescu said that while E. Coli is not typically pathogenic itself, it can indicate the presence of other pathogens, which can cause skin rashes, diarrhea, serious gastrointestinal diseases and, in very rare cases, even death. However, Angelescu said that the water quality of the Seine is likely to improve significantly before July due to drier and sunnier summer conditions, which will reduce the frequency of sewage spills. \u201cIt is highly speculative and scientifically unsound to project any conclusions about water quality during the Games based on recent trends,\u201d he said. Angelescu said that \u201csignificant infrastructure projects\u201d by the city of Paris designed to improve water quality will have a \u201csubstantial\u201d impact. \u201cThese tanks are expected to become operational before the Games, potentially becoming a \u2026 Games changer,\u201d added Angelescu. \u201cWhen our instruments and data indicate that the water quality is good, we will be the first to dive in, headfirst!\u201d Angelescu\u2019s tone of optimism isn\u2019t universally shared. French charity Surfrider Foundation Europe warned in April that they were \u201cgenuinely concerned about the health of athletes\u201d after only one of the 14 samples collected by the organization indicated a satisfactory standard of water quality for swimming. Two months later, the charity told CNN that they have since taken five additional samples, with E. coli levels remaining \u201csystematically above the guide values.\u201d CNN has not independently verified the charity\u2019s findings. How has Paris 2024 responded to these findings? Paris 2024 said they still have \u201cgreat confidence\u201d in the city of Paris to improve water quality to the \u201cnecessary standard\u201d in time for the Games. \u201cGenerally, water quality in the Seine continues to improve every day,\u201d they said in a statement to CNN in early June. \u201cBy the time of the Games, bacteriological pollution in the Seine will have been reduced by 75% thanks to the range of actions undertaken by our partners.\u201d In a statement to CNN, the city of Paris said that recent grey and rainy conditions have had a \u201cmajor impact\u201d on the Seine\u2019s water quality. A lack of sunlight \u2013 which would normally help to kill bacteria \u2013 has also contributed to the poor quality, they said earlier this month. They added: \u201cIt is only when summer conditions (strong sunshine, high temperatures, prolonged absence of rain) become established that the Seine will gradually return to its \u2018summer\u2019 appearance, and that we will see a gradual and significant improvement in water quality.\u201d Following multiple days of sunny weather in the first week of June,\u00a0E. Coli\u00a0levels improved near Pont Alexandre III Bridge, according to official data from the city of Paris shared with CNN, but whether the good weather will last remains to be seen. No precipitation trend, higher or lower than average, has been\u00a0predicted\u00a0for areas around Paris for the summer. Since June 1,\u00a0E. Coli\u00a0levels declined from around 7000 UFC/100mL (equivalent units to MPN/100mL, according to World Triathlon) to just below 1000 UFC/100mL on June 9, according to official data. However, World Triathlon\u2019s\u00a0Competition Rules\u00a02024 say that these levels are still too high for swimming, unless the organization\u2019s medical committee decides that the race can go ahead. Disinfectant and probiotics The threat that E. Coli and other bacteria pose is nothing new to triathlon teams. Over the last decade, water quality issues have been increasingly encountered, according to Mike Cavendish, Director of Performance at British Triathlon, who outlined preventative measures British athletes will be taking to ensure their health during Paris 2024. \u201cDisinfectant sounds like a really basic thing but it\u2019s something we will be doing a lot of, making sure that athletes are clean, that their equipment is clean,\u201d Cavendish told CNN in a telephone interview. Probiotic yogurts can also help to improve gut health, Cavenish added. Phil Dunne, Triathlon Canada\u2019s High Performance Director, said in a statement to CNN that their athletes are being supported by \u201ca team of physicians and dietitians\u201d to reduce the risk of becoming sick due to \u201ccompromised\u201d water quality. Tim Harradine, CEO of AusTriathlon, said that triathletes are used to dealing with the \u201cchanging nature\u201d of waterways. \u201cSometimes they race in the rain, sometimes they race in the heat,\u201d Harradine told CNN in a telephone interview, adding that athlete health will always come first. Lehair, who recently changed her nationality in time to represent Luxembourg at Paris 2024, told CNN that she understands why precautions need to be taken, but didn\u2019t seem altogether convinced by the effectiveness of measures like probiotics. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be good for the body anyway, so maybe you can have a try but it\u2019s not 100% sure that you won\u2019t get sick if you take probiotics,\u201d she said. \u201cAt least maybe you are stressing a bit less on the day of the race.\u201d \u2018Better quality of water is good for everyone\u2019 Paris 2024 isn\u2019t the first sporting event to contend with water quality issues. In March, concerns were raised after E. coli bacteria was discovered in London\u2019s River Thames ahead of the historic Oxford and Cambridge boat race. Also, in 2016, drug-resistant superbugs from hospital sewage were found in Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Guanabara Bay. Lehair is pleased that the authorities are attempting to clean up the river, but just wishes it had happened sooner. \u201cThey should have done this much before, just for the quality of the water in general and for the people, for the city,\u201d she said. \u201cBetter quality of water is good for everyone.\u201d Cavendish said that if the authorities\u2019 clean-up efforts in Paris prove successful, other countries could be encouraged to follow suit. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIf they pull this off and it looks fantastic, and they get a swim for the Olympics and the Paralympics \u2026 it puts pressure on other governments around the world, including our own, to try and make sure that we get safe swimming,\u201d said Cavendish. Harradine echoed that sentiment: \u201cIt\u2019s a very visible race venue and what a great legacy it could leave if this works well for the city.\u201d And if the worst comes to the worst and the impact of rain on water quality does threaten the triathlon races Cavendish is confident that the right call will be made. \u201cThe eyes of the world are on this race so I think you can guarantee that they (Paris 2024 and World Triathlon) will be putting all the right people in the room to make the right decision,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_06_19_sport_albania-croatia-germany-hungary-scotland-switzerland-euro-2024-spt-intl", "text": "Germany star Jamal Musiala continued his brilliant form at Euro 2024, scoring in the host\u2019s 2-0 win against Hungary on Wednesday. The 21-year-old\u2019s well-taken strike in the 22nd minute also helped maintain his nation\u2019s unbeaten streak in Group A, as Germany qualified for the knockout stages of the competition with a game to spare. Ilkay G\u00fcndo\u011fan doubled his team\u2019s lead in the 67th minute, calmly finishing off a well-worked goal. Germany, though, was tested by Hungary at the Stuttgart Arena but the underdog was unable to take any of its chances in front of goal. Musiala now has two goals at the tournament, netting his first during Germany\u2019s 5-1 demolition of Scotland on Friday. Soccer\u2019s new star Born in Germany, Musiala moved to the United Kingdom with his family as a child and it was in London where he started his football education. Musiala quickly started playing for Chelsea\u2019s academy whilst also attending Whitgift \u2013 an independent school in south London that has a history of helping develop players that have gone on to become outstanding professionals, notably Callum Hudson-Odoi and former Nigeria international Victor Moses. Speaking to CNN Sport in 2021, Musiala\u2019s old school coach said the youngster\u2019s ability was clear to see from an early age. \u201cI think from the outset, Jamal was always marked out for greatness. Jamal just stood out, his goalscoring was phenomenal,\u201d Andrew Martin, Whitgift\u2019s director of soccer, said. Musiala then moved back to Germany in 2019, signing for Bayern Munich. At just 17, he became the club\u2019s youngest ever Champions League goalscorer and went on to cement his place in Germany\u2019s national team, despite previously playing for England\u2019s youth teams. Now considered one of the most exciting attacking midfielders in the world, Musiala has been a stand out performer at Euro 2024, a tournament in which Germany is starting to look very threatening. \u201cHe\u2019s going to lead Germany to glory one day,\u201d Darmstadt coach Torsten Lieberknecht said earlier this season, after Musiala dismantled his side in a 5-2 loss to Bayern Munich. Germany will hope to continue its unbeaten run when it faces Switzerland in its final Group A game on Sunday, but one eye will now be on the round of 16. Group A: Scotland and Switzerland draw Elsewhere in Group A, Scotland and Switzerland battled to a hard-fought 1-1 draw later on Wednesday. Manchester United midfielder Scott McTominay scored the opening goal for Scotland in the 13th minute, his shot taking a huge deflection off Fabian Schar on its way to the goal. Switzerland found the equalzier 13 minutes later as Xherdan Shaqiri punished Scotland for some sloppy passing, curing a long-range effort into the top corner after picking up on a loose ball. Both teams can still qualify for the knockout stages. Scotland will face Hungary and Switzerland plays Germany on Sunday. Group B: Albania rescues dramatic draw Albania scored a stoppage-time equalizer to rescue a 2-2 draw against Croatia on Wednesday, a result which keeps its Euro 2024 campaign alive. Klaus Gjasula\u2019s 95th-minute strike capped off a thrilling encounter inside Hamburg\u2019s Volksparkstadion stadium, as this year\u2019s European Championships continues to deliver dramatic action and plot twists. The No. 66 in FIFA\u2019s world rankings, Albania had taken a surprise lead in the first half through Qazim Laci, but Croatia equalized in the 74th minute thanks to Andrej Kramari\u0107\u2019s composed finish. Just two minutes later and Croatia took the lead with the most fortunate of goals. Albania\u2019s defenders did well to block a shot but the ball ricocheted off Klaus Gjasula who inadvertently scored the cruellest of own goals. Having lost its opening game against Italy, the defeat would have left Albania on the brink of elimination from the tournament, but there was one more twist to come. With the clock ticking down, Gjasula redeemed himself in the final moments, leveling the score with a calm finish which sparked jubilant scenes from Albania\u2019s traveling fans. Croatia, ranked 56 places higher than Albania, looked disappointed by the result at full-time but a draw was probably a fair result. Albania now sits third in Group B with one point, ahead of Croatia only on goal difference. Italy and Spain are set to play each other in the other group match on Thursday.

And now, as an incoming college freshman, he\u2019s listed at 7\u20199\u2019\u2019 \u2014 and poised to be the tallest college basketball player ever. Olivier Rioux, once the record holder as the tallest teenager in the world, is now listed on the University of Florida\u2019s men\u2019s basketball roster after committing to the Gators last fall. At the time, according to recruiting site 247sports, the Montreal native and three-star recruit was just 7\u20196\u201d. At 18, he may still be growing. Rioux\u2019s listed height tops former record bearer Paul Sturgess, who was 7\u20198\u201d and played for both Florida Tech and Mountain State from 2007 to 2011. And, if Rioux makes it to the NBA, he\u2019ll become the tallest NBA player ever, too. Rioux hasn\u2019t publicly commented on the record, but he has been open in the past about enjoying his tall stature.

Still, there are some downsides to his towering over the rest of society. He has some trouble finding clothes, he said, and has banged his head on a few door frames. Ouch. Rioux started playing basketball at the age of 5, and even then his height led opposing teams to question his age. In high school, his opponents didn\u2019t hold back during games, he said \u2014 sometimes challenging Rioux more because of his size.

{"id": "2022_07_25_sport_black-representation-swimming-equality-spt-intl", "text": "Omie Dale has fond memories of splashing in the sea as a child, of racing through water parks and swimming in backwaters and rivers.   \u201cThere\u2019s so much joy that can be had once you learn to swim, once you\u2019ve abandoned those fears and you can get in the water,\u201d the 25-year-old Dale, who is based in southeast London, tells CNN Sport.  Even though swimming is a joyful experience for Dale, the stark reality is that many Black communities in Britain and the US do not have safe access to swimming lessons and public pools due to historic racism and segregation \u2013 a problem that is especially alarming given that, as Dale says, it is \u201cthe only sport that can save your life.\u201d  A history of exclusion The lack of access afforded to Black communities in Britain is what motivated Dale to become a swimming teacher in September 2019.  \u201cI used to work in Kensington (in London) as a lifeguard and some of the richest people live in that borough, but also some of the poorest,\u201d she says. She saw there was a difference when private schools and independent schools would come in and all the kids were able to swim, yet hardly any children of the same age that Dale saw from state schools could swim 25 meters.  \u201cThere\u2019s a real class barrier in the sport of swimming,\u201d Dale adds.   She is a director of Swimunity, a collective offering free swimming lessons to women and children in North Kensington, West London. It was born in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster in 2017, when a residential block caught on fire, killing 72 people \u2013 and leaving many more without homes.   \u201cThere\u2019s like a lot of people who come to swim lessons \u2026 who have undergone some form of trauma, whether that be water-related trauma or trauma related to their everyday lives,\u201d Dale says.   \u201cMany people say it\u2019s like an escape from their daily lives or is, actually, the first time that they\u2019ve taken time for themselves.\u201d  While 77% of children from the most affluent families in England can swim 25 meters unaided, only 34% from the least affluent families can, according to a 2021 survey from Sport England, a non-departmental public body that fosters grassroots sports in England.  About 95% of Black adults and 80% of Black children in England do not regularly participate in swimming, according to Sport England\u2019s report, published in January 2020. Likewise, about 93% of Asian adults and 78% of Asian children, including those with Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi heritage, do not regularly participate in swimming, the same research found. This trend extends to the US, where nearly 64% of Black children have \u201clow\u201d or no ability to swim, compared with 40% of their White peers, according to 2017 data from the country\u2019s national governing body for the sport at a competitive level, USA Swimming.   The underrepresentation of Black people in the pool in the US can be traced back to the early 20th century.   Public swimming pools became popular in North America in the 1920s and 30s and were initially open to all. However, Northern politicians stipulated a \u201cWhites Only\u201d rule, referencing racist fears about Black men fraternizing with White women.   Even after legal racial segregation ended in the US in 1964, public pools continued to be hostile environments. As people of color began to use public pools, White swimmers retreated to the privacy of their own pools and private clubs, where expensive fees continue to be an economic barrier for Black families who cannot afford the cost.    Similar examples in Britain illustrate how racial and class inequalities lead to the systemic exclusion of Black people in pools. For example, more than 4.2 million people in the UK live in ethnically diverse communities where Covid-19 national lockdowns resulted in the closure or mothballing of pools, according to Swim England \u2013 England\u2019s national swimming governing body \u2013 and the Black Swimming Association (BSA), a UK-based charity that aims to encourage more African, Caribbean and Asian communities to take up swimming.  \u2018We cannot keep recovering bodies\u2019  Globally, drowning is the third leading cause of accidental injury-related death and at least 236,000 people die each year from drowning, according to 2019 data from the World Health Organization (WHO). Children are particularly affected, with drowning being one of the top five causes of death for those aged 1-14 years in 48 of 85 countries studied by the WHO.   And while natural disasters and irregular migration are notorious risk factors, so are lower socioeconomic status, lack of higher education and being a member of an ethnic minority, depending on the country, WHO research shows.  \u201cMost drowning incidents happen when people never intend to get into the water in the first place,\u201d says Dale, who was awarded Swim Teacher of the Year by Swim England in 2021.  In December 2019, three members of the same Black British family \u2013 a 53-year-old father and his two children \u2013 died in a swimming pool at a resort in Costa del Sol, Spain, Reuters reported. The father and his 16-year-old son had reportedly leapt into the water to try to save his nine-year-old daughter, who was drowning.   Danielle Obe is the co-founder and chair of the BSA. She told CNN Sport that the Costa del Sol deaths prompted her to establish the BSA in March 2020, alongside Olympic swimmer Alice Dearing, journalist Seren Jones and songwriter, rapper and producer Ed Accura.    \u201cThis was devastating because these families were actually acquainted to me and they were from my local community,\u201d Obe says. \u201c(At) that point, I called Alice and Seren, and I said, \u2018We\u2019ve been talking about doing something for our community. We\u2019ve got to do something. We\u2019ve got to do it now. We cannot keep recovering bodies.\u2019\u201d   \u201cIt\u2019s no longer just about that lack of representation,\u201d Obe adds.   \u201cIt\u2019s now about saving lives, vital water safety, education for all. Swimming is an intervention. Swimming is a life skill.\u201d  However, there is still a lack of data when it comes to drowning-related deaths by ethnicity in the UK, says Obe.  \u201cAt the moment, we don\u2019t know how much of a disparity there is between drowning and fatalities, aquatic fatalities for different communities in the UK because, up until now, drowning data isn\u2019t really captured by ethnicity, which is another point, another issue that the BSA is looking to tackle.\u201d \u2018People just don\u2019t think Black people should swim\u2019  Dearing, the first Black female swimmer to represent Britain at the Olympics when she competed at Tokyo 2020, \u201cimplores\u201d people to learn to swim.   \u201cI have been quite torn between the amazing achievement of being the first Black woman to represent GB in swimming but wanting to be my own person, my own athlete, who\u2019s known for being an athlete and not for her race and her sport combined together,\u201d she tells CNN Sport. \u201cI take the two of them just as they are \u2013 kind of like separate things. I\u2019m trying to be the best athlete and best role model that I can be to show people that they can do the sport, that the sport is for everybody.\u201d At the age of 24, Dearing was making history in Japan and became a beacon of hope for young people \u2013 especially Black girls \u2013 who wanted to break into the sport.   But her personal triumph also drew attention to the institutional access gap for people of color in swimming.    \u201cFortunately, for myself, I haven\u2019t come across any barriers at the level I\u2019m at currently,\u201d Dearing says.   \u201cBut I have faced barriers when I was younger and issues where people just don\u2019t think Black people should swim, or do swim, or think that we\u2019re better suited to other sports and so shouldn\u2019t even learn to swim or attempt swimming in the first place.\u201d  CNN reached out to the International Swimming Federation (FINA), Sport England and USA Swimming requesting a breakdown of Black and ethnic minority participation in swimming at grassroots and professional levels of the sport. However, they told CNN they were unable to provide such data.  FINA \u2013 the global governing body for swimming \u2013 told CNN it does not have a breakdown of the ethnicities of swimmers at a grassroots or elite level.   FINA said in 2021 it allocated $6.6 million towards development programs for distribution among all national federations and continental associations, while also pushing for diversity in the sport through its \u201cSwimming for All, Swimming for Life\u201d program.   \u201cFINA remains fully committed to non-discrimination,\u201d the organization said to CNN in a statement. \u201cFINA continues to work hard to ensure that the global aquatics community is a place where all athletes, coaches and administrators are treated equally. \u201cWork will continue to develop and grow with the support of members of the aquatics community as we strive to be at the forefront of this essential area,\u201d FINA added.    Sport England told CNN in a statement that it is \u201ccommitted to increasing investment in facilities and organisations across England to try to level up access to good quality sports and activities.\u201d \u201cBarriers to getting active persist and have even been exacerbated for some disadvantaged groups \u2013 like women, people with long-term health conditions, disabled people, people from ethnically diverse communities and lower socio-economic groups,\u201d the statement added.   Sport England said in May it announced further funding that brings its total investment in its 121 partners to more than \u00a3550 million ($670 million), which they\u2019ve selected \u201cdue to their unique position to tackle entrenched activity inequalities and influence positive change throughout the sector, their own networks and beyond.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s not all about the economic side of things. It is also about getting people to feel comfortable with putting their kids in swim lessons and in competitive swimming so that they can then go and do other aquatic-based sports,\u201d Joel Shinofield, the managing director of sport development at USA Swimming, told CNN during a phone call.  USA Swimming is a membership-serviced organization that has over 3,100 clubs and more than 400,000 members, according to the official website.   \u201cOur goal is to facilitate opportunities and make sure they\u2019re good ones. While our clubs are the ones that do that on the local level, the resources, guidance, support, financial investment that we provide can shift who those opportunities can be provided to and more broadly create access,\u201d he added.   Shinofield said that USA Swimming has established a 10-year initiative that will grant $1 million to develop learn-to-swim and competitive opportunities for communities served by Historical Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The program was announced in 2021, according to the USA Swimming official website.   Serving underrepresented communities  From representing their organization at the UK\u2019s first Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Summit For Sport in Birmingham, England earlier this year to facilitating swimming classes in Hackney \u2013 one of the most deprived boroughs in London \u2013 Obe hopes that the BSA will help bridge the barrier through community-level engagement.   \u201cThat community engagement really is to build trust, accountability and collaboration with disenfranchised communities and the sector,\u201d says Obe.  \u201cOnly in understanding these attitudes and understanding some of the barriers that preclude our communities from engaging in aquatics can we begin to drive change.\u201d  In August 2021, the BSA announced it would conduct a research program with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the University of Portsmouth, exploring the behaviors and barriers that prevent African, Caribbean and Asian communities from swimming.    Speaking about the program, Obe says: \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to inspire confidence with African, Caribbean and Asian communities, and the only way we\u2019re able to do that is to ensure that we understand where these communities are in the first place and understand why they don\u2019t engage in aquatics, why we don\u2019t see the representation pool side and why we don\u2019t even see the representation within some aquatic organizations.\u201d  Dale also volunteers with Mental Health Swims, a grassroots organization that facilitates swimming meet-ups for people struggling with their mental health. As part of her work for the organization, she coordinates swim events in south London to help swimmers access the mental health benefits of the sport. She also volunteers for Pride in Water, a network that aims to increase LGBTQ+ representation in swimming.   \u2018The future is bright\u2019  Dearing says that despite the racial and economic barriers to swimming for African, Caribbean and Asian communities, she\u2019s still optimistic about the changing landscape of the sport.  \u201cI really think if anything is going to change, it\u2019s going to be now, it\u2019s going to be over the next couple of years,\u201d she says. \u201cEach story is different, each person is different and has to be understood in their own way, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, that\u2019s just another challenge that we have to face and we\u2019re up for it.  \u201cIt\u2019s tough \u2013 it\u2019s not a quick fix, but the future is bright.  \u201cI like to feel that I\u2019m giving something back to swimming and, hopefully, giving something to the Black community to hopefully achieve, strive for and change the way that Black people are viewed in swimming and the way Black people view swimming.  \u201cIt\u2019s a double-edged sword; I absolutely love doing it. Sometimes, it\u2019s really frightening and daunting, but if I\u2019m trying to make the world a better place, then sometimes you got to step out and scare yourself.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/07/25/sport/black-representation-swimming-equality-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "sports"}}

In the letter to UEFA\u00a0General Secretary\u00a0Theodore Theodoridis\u00a0on Thursday, the assocation describes it as \u201cshameful\u00a0joint chanting by fans of both national teams, which was directed against the Serbian\u00a0nation as a whole.\u201d The chant, the\u00a0Serbian\u00a0association said, was \u201ckill, kill, kill the Serb.\u201d The General Secretary of the Football Association of Serbia, Jovan \u0160urbatovi\u0107, also threatened to pull the Serbia team out of the tournament, according\u00a0to Serbia state broadcaster Radio Television of Serbia (RTS/PTC)\u00a0in comments published on Wednesday evening. \u201cWhat\u00a0happened is scandalous and we will ask UEFA for sanctions, even if it means not continuing the competition,\u201d\u00a0\u0160urbatovi\u0107 said, according to RTS. On Thursday, UEFA said it had appointed an inspector \u201cto conduct an investigation regarding potential racist and/or discriminatory conduct by supporters\u201d during Croatia\u2019s game against Albania. Serbia played its second Group C match in Euro 2024 against Slovenia earlier on Thursday, drawing 1-1 to keep alive its chances of qualifying for Euro 2024\u2019s knockout stages.\u00a0Albania and Croatia drew 2-2 in their match Wednesday. Animosity between Croatian and Albanian fans towards Serbia stems from the 1990s and the Balkan conflicts and are generally seen as being ethnic and political grievances. The issues\u00a0include a\u00a0focus around the issue of Kosovo, a former\u00a0autonomous province of Serbia but has majority ethnic Albanians. In the letter posted online by the Football Association of Serbia it asked UEFA, the governing\u00a0body of European football, to \u201cpunish those responsible\u201d for their actions and reminded the organization \u201cthat this kind of rampage, hatred and racism represent everything that your organization is fighting against.\u201d The letter also details the exact time the chant was\u00a0reportedly\u00a0heard \u2013 the 58th\u00a0minute \u2013 and accused an\u00a0unnamed\u00a0Albanian player of using a megaphone after the game\u00a0of \u201cinflaming\u201d the crowd\u00a0using the same chant. The Croatian Football Federation told CNN that, as far as it was aware, its fans were not involved in any racist or discriminatory chants during the match against Albania, and said it was not mentioned in the UEFA delegate\u2019s report. CNN has contacted the Albanian soccer federation for comment on the Football Association of Serbia\u2019s\u00a0letter. On Thursday, UEFA also said it was also investigating the \u201calleged inappropriate behaviour\u201d of Albania\u2019s forward Mirlind Daku. It did not specify if this was the player Serbia referred to in its letter. Since the beginning of the tournament last week, the Serbian and Albanian soccer associations have each been fined by UEFA for fan incidents. UEFA said they have fined the Albanian Football Association\u00a0for four incidents at their opening match versus Italy \u2013 lighting\u00a0off fireworks, throwing objects, pitch invasion and \u201ctransmitting provocative messages not fit for a sports event.\u201d In total, Albania was fined\u00a037,375 euros (approximately $40,000)\u00a0for the incidents. Following Serbia\u2019s 1-0 loss to England on Sunday,\u00a0the Kosovar Football Association submitted a request to UEFA for a banner and chants\u00a0reportedly\u00a0sung by\u00a0Serbian\u00a0fans\u00a0at its match.\u00a0The statement called the chants \u201cchauvinistic and racist.\u201d UEFA has fined Serbia for fans\u00a0\u201ctransmitting a provocative message not fit for a sports event\u201d and throwing of objects. Both of which resulted in a\u00a0total 14,500 euro (approximately $15,500)\u00a0fine.

{"id": "2023_10_30_sport_enhanced-games-olympics-doping-spt-intl", "text": "The 2024 Olympics are fast approaching and as athletes gear up for one of the world\u2019s most prestigious sporting events, one entrepreneur has a different idea of what \u201cfaster, higher, stronger\u201d \u2013 the former motto of the Games \u2013 might represent. The Enhanced Games says it is an \u201calternative\u201d to what it calls the \u201ccorrupt Olympics Games.\u201d Athletes competing at the Enhanced Games will be free to use performance-enhancing drugs, they won\u2019t be tested and will be under no obligation to declare which substances they have taken in order to compete. That\u2019s quite a contrast to the Olympics\u2019 doping protocols. The International Testing Agency (ITA) will be responsible for looking after Paris 2024\u2019s anti-doping program. Six years ago, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which oversees the Olympics, delegated its entire clean sport program to the ITA. However, historically the Olympic Games have been dogged by a series of doping and kickback scandals. When approached for comment on the Enhanced Games and allegations of corruption, the IOC told CNN Sport that \u201cthe idea does not merit any comment.\u201d \u2018Danger to health, to sport\u2019 CNN Sport interviewed a number of experts in the field of doping for this story, who expressed concern that the Enhanced Games was an extremely dangerous proposition. Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, who exposed Russia\u2019s state-sponsored doping program \u2013 a massive, years-long effort which benefited more than 1,000 athletes between 2011 and 2015 \u2013 said that the Enhanced Games is a \u201cdanger to health, to sport.\u201d Whether the Enhanced Games will ever take place remains an open question, but the very idea is drawing considerable blowback from leading anti-doping officials and sporting organizations. The Enhanced Games is the brainchild of businessman Aron D\u2019Souza. He is also the founding editor of \u201cThe Journal Jurisprudence,\u201d a quarterly publication on legal philosophy, according to his website, which also describes him as an \u201cavid athlete.\u201d Recently, D\u2019Souza told CNN Sport he has \u201csigned term sheets with prominent venture capital firms\u201d in relation to the Enhanced Games and is \u201cwaiting on the lawyers to finish long-form drafting.\u201d He also said that a funding announcement is planned for early December. Although not legally binding, term sheets are a serious expression of intent by both sides, setting out the broad principles of an agreement. D\u2019Souza believes what he calls a \u201cscience-driven\u201d competition is the next step in the evolution of sport, suggesting that the absence of drug testing will level the playing field. According to a 2020 study from Raphael Faiss, Research Manager at the centre of Research and Expertise in anti-doping sciences at the University of Lausanne, data from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) suggests less than 2% of athletes dope. However, Faiss told CNN Sport the number of athletes taking performance-enhancing drugs is likely significantly higher; his research, based on two international major athletic events in 2011 and 2013, suggests the figure could be between 15 to 18%. Faiss and his team compared athletes\u2019 blood results collected by WADA-accredited labs to values from healthy adults, as well as doped and undoped athletes; the closer the values are to those of subjects to whom erythropoietin (EPO, which is used in blood doping) had been administered, the higher the chances that they\u2019re actually doping. This analysis, Faiss said, is not proof of doping, but is a \u201crobust way\u201d of analyzing the data, allowing scientists to make an estimate for doping prevalence, as well as targeting athletes most likely to be doping. In written comments to CNN Sport, WADA said: \u201cDetermining the level of [doping] prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed,\u201d explaining that, since 2017, a \u201cprevalence working group\u201d has been established to \u201cdetermine if strategies, reliable methods and tools can be developed to adequately assess the prevalence of doping in sports.\u201d WADA told CNN Sport that the group has delivered \u201cseveral recommendations and guidance to WADA but not the final ones yet.\u201d WADA has reservations about Faiss\u2019 study and pointed to the \u201ccomplexity of trying to measure [doping] prevalence,\u201d highlighting that reports have \u201cgreatly varying results.\u201d The anti-doping organization added: \u201cNo single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline.\u201d \u201cComparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system\u2019s testing figures isn\u2019t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence. \u201cIn any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries \u2013 it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others. \u201cThe Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures.\u201d Editor\u2019s note: You can find WADA\u2019s full statement at the bottom of this article.\u00a0 \u2018A dangerous clown show\u2019 Travis Tygart, the Chief Executive Officer at the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), told CNN Sport that the idea of an Enhanced Games is \u201cfarcical \u2026 likely illegal in many [US] states\u201d and \u201ca dangerous clown show, not real sport.\u201d Substances such as anabolic steroids \u2013 which help to build muscle mass by enabling athletes to train harder and recover quickly from strenuous workouts \u2013 are classified as a Schedule III drug by the US Drug Enforcement Administration. When asked whether anabolic steroids will be allowed at the games and whether athletes would be tested for illegal drugs such as cocaine, D\u2019Souza told CNN Sport that \u201cwe will not be drug testing at the games.\u201d He added: \u201cWe do not propose to regulate what athletes use.\u201d Anabolic steroids may be prescribed by a licensed physician for the treatment of certain conditions such as testosterone deficiency, but if used in the US without a prescription from a licensed physician, a first conviction could result in a one-year prison sentence and a $1,000 fine. But that isn\u2019t the only potential legal jeopardy the Enhanced Games faces, according to American lawyer Jim Walden, who represents Russian whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov. \u201cIf you look at the Enhanced Games website, it\u2019s almost as though they\u2019re advertising their disregard of the law,\u201d Walden told CNN Sport. \u201cThey wrap themselves up in what I will call the cloak of legitimacy by using phrases like body autonomy and coming out as an enhanced athlete. \u201cI hope they\u2019re thinking hard about how they\u2019re going to pull this off in the world in which the FBI has a specific unit that is called the Sports and Gaming Initiative that\u2019s focusing on these very issues.\u201d The Sports and Gaming Initiative was developed to \u201cprotect athletes and sporting institutions in the United States from criminal threats and influences,\u201d according to the government website. The initiative works in partnership with sports leagues and governing bodies, international law enforcement and independent watchdog groups to tackle crimes such as fraud, doping and match-fixing; criminal activities, it says, \u201cdegrade the integrity of sports and competition and erode public confidence in these cherished institutions.\u201d \u201cThe use of doping substances is not acceptable in modern sports,\u201d Rodchenkov said in his written comments to CNN. \u201cPromotion and advertising of banned substances is against sport rules and moral, letter and spirit. \u201cIt might bring an extreme harm to young generation[s] of athletes who mistakenly could believe in benefits of [the] Enhanced Games.\u201d Rodchenkov, the protagonist of the Oscar-winning Netflix documentary Icarus who is currently under FBI protection, also believes that the Enhanced Games\u2019 organizers \u201cmight get investigated [\u2026] under the Rodchenkov Act.\u201d The Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act, named after the whistleblower, allows the US to impose criminal sanctions on individuals involved in doping activities at international events. However, the Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act does not apply to sporting events that don\u2019t adopt the WADA code, which the Enhanced Games wouldn\u2019t do. Rodchenkov also added that WADA athletes could not have any affiliation or contact with so-called enhanced athletes, or they would risk being charged under Article 2.10 \u2013 \u201cProhibited Association by an Athlete or Other Person\u201d \u2013 of the World Anti-Doping Code. USADA\u2019s Tygart also told CNN Sport: \u201cNo one really wants our children growing up idolizing unbridled drug use in sport, even if some profiteers think otherwise.\u201d D\u2019Souza insists his motivation for founding the Enhanced Games isn\u2019t financial. If he had wanted to make more money, he says he\u2019d continue to be a \u201cquiet, mild-mannered venture capitalist.\u201d \u201cI do think fundamentally that consumers want this [the Enhanced Games] and athletes want this because if you go to the cinemas, no one\u2019s interested in histories in the past anymore,\u201d said D\u2019Souza. \u201cThey\u2019re interested in superheroes and technology in the future. And this is literally what we are bringing to a reality.\u201d \u2018The dirtiest Olympics in history\u2019 According to Pierre de Coubertin \u2013 the founder of the modern Olympics \u2013 \u201cfor every man, woman and child, it [sport] offers an opportunity for self-improvement.\u201d Except historically, many athletes competing in the Olympics have taken the idea of self-improvement too far, notably at London 2012, which Rodchenkov has previously called \u201cthe dirtiest Olympics in history.\u201d When the ITA concluded its re-analysis program for the London Games, it found 73 anti-doping rule violations, which led to the withdrawal of 31 medals and reallocation of 46 Olympic medals across the sports of athletics, weightlifting, wrestling and canoeing. Doping has been an issue at the Olympics throughout the event\u2019s history, and the 100-meter final at the 1988 Games has become one of the most infamous and controversial moments in sporting history. Six of the eight finalists \u2013 notably the winner, Ben Johnson \u2013 who lined up on that September day in Seoul 35 years ago would fail drug tests themselves or be implicated in drug use during their careers. Despite some athletes continuing to cheat, global antidoping efforts remain ever-present, according to the testers. Recent out-of-competition (OOC) testing data published by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) highlights positive results from steps being taken to keep \u201celite podiums and finals clean,\u201d according to the anti-doping organization. Data focused on OOC testing ahead of last year\u2019s World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon, shows how resources and testing are targeting those athletes most likely to win medals and make finals. Whilst only 39% of the athletes in Eugene had three or more OOC tests in the 10 months leading up the event, 81% of top-eight finishers had three or more OOC tests. Yet the cat and mouse game between testers and athletes using banned substances continues. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly about the question of timing and targeting the right athletes,\u201d said Faiss. Given that athletes have their blood values regularly monitored, it is \u201cgetting more difficult for athletes to use high doses [of drugs such as EPO], but they would still be using micro dosing.\u201d By taking EPO late at night and drinking enough water, the substance would not be detected in athletes the following morning, according to Faiss, though athletes suspected of blood doping could be tested in the middle of the night. \u201cAthletes are actually getting back to very simple ways of doping with steroids,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cEPO is quite simple to use, but still tricky to detect.\u201d Athletes \u201cuse the drugs that are actively working.\u201d When it comes to new substances such as Roxadustat \u2013 the drug that two-time grand slam champion Simona Halep has recently been given a four-year ban for taking, although she denies ever knowingly or intentionally taking any prohibited substance \u2013 Faiss said athletes \u201care likely to use substances with a very short half-life in [the] body that are mimicking processes of the oxygen carrying improvements through the EPO channels.\u201d Roxadustat has an elimination half-life of 10-16 hours, according to the National Institutes of Health. Athletes are \u201cseeking to find substances where the [half-life] time window is very short, to make sure that if they are not tested at the right moment, they won\u2019t be caught,\u201d said Faiss. \u2018Challenge for sporting competition\u2019 Michele Verroken, the founding director of consultancy group Sporting Integrity, believes an antidoping system is required that will \u201cgive a lot more credibility, a lot more immediacy to verifying results, if we\u2019re going to keep the hearts and minds of athletes.\u201d Verroken also questions what\u2019s stopping an athlete from cheating if they only get caught 10 years after the event, or not at all. Under the World Anti-Doping Code, there is a 10-year statute of limitations on samples taken from 2015 onwards. Verroken told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games is \u201csetting a really interesting challenge for sporting competition.\u201d Not unsurprisingly, many sporting bodies have condemned the event. The Australian Olympic Committee called it \u201cdangerous and irresponsible,\u201d saying that \u201cthe world needs better than this.\u201d UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) said it \u201cis extremely concerned by the concept of an Enhanced Games,\u201d adding that \u201cthere is no place in sport for performance enhancing drugs, nor the Enhanced Games.\u201d UKAD\u2019s Director of Operations, Hamish Coffey, told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games sets a \u201chugely dangerous precedent,\u201d expressing concern over the kind of messaging the event sends to the next generation of athletes. \u2018Very accomplished athletes\u2019 When CNN Sport spoke to D\u2019Souza shortly after the proposed event\u2019s announcement, he said that 368 athletes had enquired about the Enhanced Games and more had messaged via social media. The organization\u2019s Chief Athletes Officer and former Olympian Brett Fraser, who swam for the Cayman Islands at three Olympic Games, told CNN Sport that \u201cvery accomplished athletes\u201d at the level of Olympic finalists have reached out \u201cto understand more about how the first Games will take place and how they can become involved.\u201d Fraser added that Enhanced Games organizers \u201calready have an Olympic medallist\u201d for their athlete commission, though he didn\u2019t specify who that was. He also said there has been \u201ca lot of positive feedback and a lot of acceptance and excitement from younger generations.\u201d Nonetheless, none of the athletes appear prepared to speak publicly at this stage. For those who do want to compete, the Enhanced Games would be an annual event with five categories \u2013 track and field, swimming, weightlifting, gymnastics and martial arts. The huge cost of hosting an Olympic Games is no secret, with countries often striving to create bigger and better spectacles by blowing their budget. Tokyo 2021 had the largest Olympic sports program in history, with 33 sports competitions in 42 venues culminating in 339 medal events. The Covid-impacted Games were delivered with a final expenditure of $13 billion \u2013 almost double the $7.3 billion that was originally forecast. Meanwhile, keeping the IOC\u2019s philosophy of \u201clower-impact Games\u201d in mind, 95% of venues will be pre-existing facilities at the Paris 2024 Olympics. D\u2019Souza said the Enhanced Games will focus on fewer sports, reuse existing infrastructure and fund the event through the private sector to \u201cdeliver a high-impact yet cost-efficient games\u201d so profits can be shared with the athletes. He added that the Enhanced Games is looking for a seven-figure prize pool for any athlete potentially breaking Usain Bolt\u2019s 100-meter world record of 9.58 seconds. \u201cI\u2019ve had conversations with people who are top-10 sprinters in the world who are going to the next Olympics, and they said [\u2026] if there\u2019s a million-dollar prize to break the 100m world record, I\u2019ll be there,\u201d said D\u2019Souza. Universal basic income and mental health support to athletes will also be part of an \u201cenhanced athletes programme.\u201d When asked who would take responsibility if an athlete competing at the Enhanced Games were to suffer fatal consequences, D\u2019Souza told CNN Sport that \u201cour athletes at the games will be the most monitored athletes in history.\u201d He said: \u201cWe will focus on athlete safety by mandating athletes have pre-competition full-system clinical screenings including blood tests and EKGs.\u201d \u201cThis will ensure that athletes are healthy to complete and not at risk of major health complications.\u201d D\u2019Souza also said that athletes will sign waivers in order\u00a0to compete. As it stands, no venues are officially in place to host the event and D\u2019Souza admits its scale will be dependent on funding and media partnerships. \u201cWe\u2019re in commercial negotiations with venues and media partners at the moment,\u201d added D\u2019Souza, who said the first Enhanced Games will be at a university campus or a similar facility in the south of the US and that a number of trademarks have been filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. \u2018Undermine the very purpose of sport\u2019 Elite performance coach Trevor Painter, who has worked with a number of Olympic and international sprinters and middle-distance runners, said he would \u201cnever\u201d coach an athlete taking performance-enhancing drugs because it would go against his morals as a coach. \u201cHaving been involved with many athletes that have lost in many ways to the cheats, I won\u2019t be engaging with [the Enhanced Games],\u201d Painter told CNN Sport. If it goes ahead as planned in December 2024, D\u2019Souza insists that the Enhanced Games will unlock the potential of humanity. But according to John William Devine, Senior Lecturer in Ethics, Sport and Exercise Sciences at Swansea University in Wales, the Enhanced Games will make sporting competition more unfair than it already is and even \u201cundermine the very purpose of the sport in question.\u201d Devine told CNN Sport that \u201cperformance-enhancing drugs don\u2019t actually lead to better athletic performance. They obscure athletic performance.\u201d He added that, although the Enhanced Games may look very similar to the Olympics, the nature of the activity will be different, raising the question: \u201cTo what extent is drug-assisted performance reflective of the athletes\u2019 sporting excellence?\u201d WADA response in full: Determining the level of prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed. That is why we set up a\u00a0Working Group on Doping Prevalence\u00a0in 2017. Measuring doping prevalence is a difficult and complex process. Through its work, the group found a huge variance across the many prevalence studies that have been carried out, leading it to publish guidelines on how to improve the quality of measuring prevalence. WADA is currently developing a tool that Anti-Doping Organizations can use to evaluate the effectiveness of their programs. WADA is well aware of the [Faiss] study. Indeed, one of the contributors, Prof. Martial Saugy, is a member of the Working Group. This study is one of many that helps to inform the Group\u2019s work. It is a very narrow study. It looks at two events, in a single sport, held 10 and 12 years ago, using just one method of measurement (the Athlete Biological Passport (ABP)). As far as I am aware, there is no comparable data from more recent World Championships in the same sport. Given its limited scope, it is important that this study be analyzed within the wider context of other studies and not be taken in isolation. This study also highlights the complexity of trying to measure prevalence. It is the third published paper that sought to measure prevalence at the 2011 Athletics World Championships. Each reported greatly varying results. The fact is no single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline. Results will always come with caveats and margins of error and will be based on a variety of methods, including self-report questionnaires, analytical methods (like ABP and testing data) and other methods to give a more rounded estimate of what the most likely figure would be. Comparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system\u2019s testing figures isn\u2019t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence. In any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries \u2013 it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others. The Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/10/30/sport/enhanced-games-olympics-doping-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_sport_slovakia-ukraine-poland-austria-france-netherlands-euro-2024-spt-intl", "text": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 was an unused substitute in France\u2019s goalless draw against the Netherlands on Friday, after the striker broke his nose in his nation\u2019s opening game of Euro 2024. There had been fears the France captain would miss the Group D clash, but manager Didier Deschamps told reporters Thursday that his star man would be available. However, the decision was made to rest Mbapp\u00e9, who watched on as his teammates failed to find a breakthrough against the Oranje. In truth, Les Bleus almost lost the match. Xavi Simons thought he had scored the winner for the Netherlands in the second half, but the goal was controversially ruled out for an offside. Simons himself was clearly onside but teammate Denzel Dumfries was in an offside position and was adjudged by the video assistant referee (VAR) to have hindered France goalkeeper Mike Maignan. Without its star striker, France struggled to finish off its chances and continued to be wasteful in front of goal throughout the match \u2013 Adrien Rabiot and Antoine Griezmann were guilty of missing two notable opportunities. However, the draw is likely enough to secure France\u2019s progression into the knockout stages. Les Bleus will have the chance to win the group when they play Poland on Tuesday. The final group stage game will be another opportunity for Mbapp\u00e9 to make his return; the 25-year-old had trained earlier this week, donning a French-inspired tricolore mask. However, Mbapp\u00e9 is not allowed to wear the multicolored mask during a Euro 2024 match as UEFA\u2019s rules stipulate that \u201cmedical equipment worn on the field of play must be a single colour and free of team and manufacturer identification.\u201d Group E: Ukraine secures comeback win Ukraine, playing in its first major tournament since the war began in 2022, produced a stirring performance at Euro 2024 on Friday, securing a comeback 2-1 win against Slovakia in Group E. Goals from Mykola Shaparenko and Roman Yaremchuk rescued what would have been a devastating result for the Blue and Yellow \u2013 a loss would have put the nation on the brink of elimination from the tournament. Ukraine suffered a chastening defeat in its opening group game on Monday, producing a dour display in a 3-0 defeat against Romania. Its performance was far better against Slovakia, but the team was still second-best for much of the first half, falling behind in the 17th minute after Ivan Schranz\u2019s header. But Ukraine looked rejuvenated after the break and came out for the second half with a new sense of belief. Shaparenko kept his calm to finish off a well-worked move in the 54th minute, before Yaremchuk poked home the winner with 10 minutes left to go. Coming into the tournament, Ukraine\u2019s manager Serhiy Rebrov told CNN Sport that he wanted his team to lift the spirits of Ukrainians around the world during Euro 2024. In doing just that on Friday, Ukraine also reignited its hopes of progressing into the knockout stages of the competition \u2013 the squad now sits second in Group E with one group match still left to play against Belgium on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s very good emotions for our people of Ukraine who are really missing these emotions,\u201d Rebrov said in his post-match interview on Friday. \u201cMost important, today, we showed the spirit. In this kind of tournament, you can win, you can lose, but it\u2019s very important how you do it. \u201cWe deserve this win and I think today we really played with spirit.\u201d Group D: Poland out of Euro 2024 Earlier on Friday, Austria beat Poland 3-1 in Group D, a result which later meant the latter would exit Euro 2024. Gernot Trauner scored a brilliant header in the ninth minute to put the Burschen ahead, but Poland equalized before half-time through Krzysztof Pi\u0105tek. A draw would have left both teams facing an uphill challenge to reach the knockout stages of the tournament, so each squad went in search of a winner. It was Austria which showed most composure in front of goal and Christoph Baumgartner produced a clinical finish to hand his team the lead, before captain Marko Arnautovi\u0107 added a third from the penalty spot. France\u2019s draw against the Netherlands late on Friday meant Poland became the first team to exit the tournament.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/sport/slovakia-ukraine-poland-austria-france-netherlands-euro-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_sport_diede-de-groot-tennis-unstoppable-force-spt-intl", "text": "It\u2019s one thing to beat the best. It is, however, an entirely different proposition to be the best. To evolve from the hunter and become the hunted \u2013 and not just over the course of a week, month, or perhaps even years. Moreover, to do so over a prolonged period, set against the backdrop of ever-changing competitors, landscapes and the sands of time and physiology. Wheelchair\u00a0tennis player Diede de Groot, though, has been unequivocally the dominant constant in the face of those challenges. \u2018Diede the Great\u2019 \u201cI feel a very big target on my back which is what keeps me motivated,\u201d De Groot told CNN ahead of the French Open. \u201cI know all of these girls are working towards beating me which is fun but intense at the same time. \u201cThey\u2019re not playing with any pressure when they\u2019re playing against me and I have all the pressure because there\u2019s this massive streak that\u2019s following me everywhere. \u201cAt the same time, I really try to forget about all of that and just play tennis.\u201d In a world where we\u2019re inundated daily with statistics ranging from the intriguing to the inane, De Groot\u2019s numbers make for truly remarkable reading. She is the first tennis player \u2013 wheelchair or able-bodied \u2013 ever to win three successive calendar grand slams. She is the first women\u2019s wheelchair tennis player to achieve the Golden Slam \u2013 all four grand slams and a Paralympic gold medal \u2013 in 2021. De Groot is also unbeaten in grand slam tournaments since the 2021 Australian Open, currently boasting a winning streak that has surpassed 130 matches. Based on facts and figures alone, one would be hard pushed to begrudge the 27-year-old for possessing the bold \u2013 yet prophetic and linguistically apt \u2013 social media handle of @DiedetheGreat. \u201cI was too humble to say Diede the Great,\u201d she says smiling. \u201cMy own last name Groot was already taken, so I had to come up with something else and then the literal translation of Groot is great. So that\u2019s how it sort of came to be. \u201cDuring the year, maybe I don\u2019t think about it [records] enough \u2026 especially in tennis because it\u2019s just like a continuous streak of tournaments. It\u2019s difficult to really take time. \u201cBut when I\u2019m just at home sitting, thinking of the amazing things that I\u2019ve already done to this point, I\u2019m very proud of myself.\u201d Wall of Champions So what\u2019s the secret of the Dutch star\u2019s success? \u201cI don\u2019t think I have the biggest serve. I don\u2019t think I have the biggest forehand,\u201d De Groot reflected. \u201cI just think that I\u2019m very good at all of the levels \u2026 I\u2019m a complete player. \u201cI don\u2019t really have a weak point and that\u2019s very difficult for opponents to, to play against.\u201d De Groot\u2019s current grand slam singles tally stands at 21. Her latest victory at this year\u2019s Australian Open was not only a remarkable 13th in a row but it also drew her level alongside the great Esther Vergeer\u2019s grand slam tally. Vergeer\u2019s 21st and final major title came at Roland Garros in 2012. Whilst De Groot still has some way to go to encroach on her compatriots astonishing 470-match unbeaten winning streak, it\u2019s fitting then that she\u2019ll have the chance to become the most successful women\u2019s wheelchair tennis player of all time at this year\u2019s French Open. Victory in Paris would consolidate De Groot\u2019s position as third in the all-time list of overall grand slam champions across singles and doubles. The 27-year-old\u2019s current tally stands at 39. Vergeer finished her career with 42 titles, second only to Japan\u2019s recently retired Shingo Kunieda, the most decorated men\u2019s player in the history of wheelchair tennis, who amassed an astonishing 50 majors. Hotbed of talent Aside from her technical prowess, the foundations of De Groot\u2019s trophy-laden career \u2013 and for that matter her compatriot Vergeer\u2019s \u2013 can also be attributed to the Dutch tennis system. It\u2019s one which allows wheelchair tennis to integrate with able-bodied players, a strategy that has worked to stunning effect. \u201cI started wheelchair tennis when I was seven years old \u2026 I had a few operations done on my hip [and] the rehabilitation center advised me: \u2018Hey, would you like tennis?\u2019 I picked it up, and I loved it straight away,\u201d said De Groot, who was born with unequal leg length. \u201cTo have that feeling that I could play tennis just like all the other kids in the group \u2026 it was very special to have that. \u201cWe are fully integrated into the KNLTB [Royal Dutch Lawn Tennis Association] program. We are treated like athletes [and] being taken seriously really helps taking yourself seriously.\u201d The KNLT\u2019s National Tennis Centre, located in Amstelveen, boasts 14 outdoor and 14 indoor courts with accessibility for wheelchair tennis. \u201cTwenty years ago wheelchair tennis was one of the biggest Paralympic sports in the Netherlands,\u201d says De Groot. \u201cWe already were very lucky to have a very good number one gold medalist [Vergeer] and because we were such a small country, we could all see each other play. \u201cAnd just learning from previous generations \u2026 I could learn from the women that went before me. I could see it from up close and therefore mimic it or even try to do better.\u201d De Groot and Vergeer both herald from the historic Dutch city of Woerden, which has produced a conveyor belt of some of the greatest players from The Netherlands to have ever graced the sport. So is there something special in the Woerden waters. \u201cWe lived very close to each other which is actually quite special,\u201d De Groot says. \u201cAnother world number one \u2013 Jiske Griffioen \u2013 also comes from there. So, it\u2019s just a coincidence \u2026 but it\u2019s a funny coincidence!\u201d \u2018We are being noticed\u2019 Wheelchair tennis events are now gradually being incorporated into a growing number of ATP and WTA events. The prestigious Miami Open hosted an event for the very first time earlier this year and Wimbledon has announced it will double the size of the wheelchair draws for this summer\u2019s tournament. \u201cI would say that from history, Paralympics were always the moment that all eyes were on us,\u201d reflected De Groot. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have to share it with able-bodied athletes. \u201cBut then for another four years, we would sort of fall to the background again \u2026 now I really feel like these players are noticing us. They\u2019re recognizing us and interacting with us more and more. \u201cI saw Jannik Sinner play with our world No. 1 Alfie Hewitt [in Miami]. Novak \u2026 he\u2019s done some really good promotion with Dylan Alcott before so hopefully these moments will be more and more \u201cCountries are developing their programs and players are developing their games. It\u2019s a really fun time to be a wheelchair tennis player.\u201d Paris 2024 When it came to the Covid-impacted Tokyo Games, the Dutch star had an unprecedented weight of history of her shoulders. Dutch women have won every wheelchair tennis title \u2013 singles and doubles \u2013 since it became a medal event 32 years ago. De Groot stormed to singles and doubles gold without dropping a set in either competition. It remains one of the defining moments of her career. \u201cFor a long time, a lot of people ask me that without gold, your career wouldn\u2019t be complete. I never thought about it that way. \u201cWinning gold in Tokyo really felt like it was like a completion of so many years already that I\u2019ve been doing so well. So many things came from winning those medals that it definitely sparked something around me, which is very good.\u201d The Dutch phenom is on track to return to the clay courts of Roland Garros to defend her titles this summer at Paris 2024. It\u2019s a challenge she\u2019s relishing and with her imperious track record to date in the French capital \u2013 winning a total of nine grand slam titles \u2013 you\u2019d be a brave person to bet against her. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a different Paralympics,\u201d she says. \u201c[I] played in Rio. I was very new there. [I] Played in Tokyo. No one was allowed to come and watch and I had all the pressure there. And now I\u2019m a defending champion with everyone there. \u201cIt will mean everything [to defend the titles]. It\u2019s the goal that I\u2019m aiming at. \u201cI still have many tournaments before so my head is not yet there, but it will be and I\u2019m going to enjoy it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/sport/diede-de-groot-tennis-unstoppable-force-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_sport_willie-mays-negro-league-tribute-game", "text": "All eyes in American baseball turned to \ufeffBirmingham, Alabama\u2019s historic Rickwood Field Thursday night, where the stands shook with deafening applause and hoots of pride in honor of one of the best the game has ever seen. Three days after the legendary Willie Mays died at 93, Major League Baseball honored him at the oldest professional ballpark in America, where a teenaged Mays once roamed the outfield for the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro Leagues. Though the MLB planned Thursday\u2019s game between the San Francisco Giants and St. Louis Cardinals to be a tribute to the Negro Leagues and recognition of Mays\u2019s legacy, the Hall of Famer\u2019s death on Tuesday transformed the evening into an emotional \u2013 and overwhelmingly joyful \u2013 remembrance of the legend. \u201cWe all wanted to be like Willie,\u201d Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson said on the Fox broadcast. \u201cWhen one played against him, one got caught up in watching Willie. He was pure baseball, my all-time favorite. I loved the guy, I wanted to be like Willie.\u201d Just a day before his death, Mays said he wouldn\u2019t be able to attend the tribute game in his hometown and would instead watch the event on TV. But his son, Michael Mays, said his presence could be felt Thursday night. \u201cBirmingham, I\u2019ve been telling y\u2019all that if there\u2019s any way on earth my father could come down here, that he would. Well he\u2019s found another way,\u201d the son told the packed stadium Thursday. \u201cLet him hear you! He\u2019s listening.\u201d Chants of \u201cWillie! Willie!\u201d grew to a crescendo across the stands as Mays\u2019 son and the field of veteran players looked on. The swell of applause soon softened and heads bowed as Grammy-award-winning artist Jon Batiste led a preformance of \u201cLift Every Voice and Sing\u201d in tribute to Mays. Approximately 60 Negro League players were in attendance \u2013 marking the largest official gathering of the league\u2019s players in nearly 30 years, according to the MLB. A line of Negro League luminaries processed onto Rickwood Field before the game as \u201cWhen the Saints Go Marching In\u201d swelled through the stadium. Attendees included Bill Greason, Eugene Scruggs, Pedro Sierra and Henry Collins. Lively jazz performances led by Batiste throughout the event showcased the Negro League\u2019s storied relationship with jazz artists. Country artists Brittney Spencer and Willie Jones and blues singer C.S. Armstrong joined Batiste in several songs. The first pitch was thrown by 99-year-old Greason, who played with Mays on the Birmingham Barons and pitched for the St Louis Cardinals in 1954. The Cardinals went on to beat out the Giants 6-5 but much of the focus remained on Mays and the brilliant careers of the Neagro League players. \u201cTodays feels like it\u2019s a little bit bigger than baseball,\u201d Cardinals shortstop Masyn Winn told the Fox broadcast before the game. Greason, who served as a mentor to teenaged Mays, told Fox Sports reporter Ken Rosenthal that Negro League players took to the field despite racism and segregation. \u201cWe didn\u2019t allow segregation to stop us from playing, from using our talents and gifts for what we were there for. It was a tremendous blessing to have a gift from God to be recognized as such.\u201d Honoring a long, captivating career Though the Giants did not take home a win Thursday, their place on the field seemed especially fitting. It was with the Giants that Mays made his Major League debut in 1951 at the age of 20 after departing the Negro Leagues. His star quickly rose. He became Rookie of the Year and helped New York rally from a 13-game deficit to tie the Brooklyn Dodgers at the end of regular season. In 1958, baseball\u2019s landscape changed dramatically as the Giants moved west to San Francisco but Mays continued to deliver an outstanding level of play. He notched a career-high .347 batting average in his first season out west. Four years later, Mays\u2019 49 homers and 141 runs batted in (RBI) helped the Giants return to the World Series, where they lost a 7-game thriller to the New York Yankees. Mays was a five-tool player with the rare ability to hit for power and for average while also excelling at\u00a0running, throwing and fielding. In 23 major league seasons, mostly with the New York Giants and the San Francisco Giants, he finished with\u00a0660 career home runs\u00a0\u2013 then the second most behind legend Babe Ruth. Mays would play in 24 All-Star games before retiring in 1973 after two seasons with the New York Mets. The Giants have since retired his number, 24. \u201cThe overwhelming consensus is that Willie Mays is the greatest all-around player who has ever played,\u201d veteran sportscaster Bob Costas told CNN. \u201cAnd, as sad as it is, there\u2019s something poetic about the fact that he passes while much of the baseball world is gathered in Birmingham, Alabama, in Rickwood Field, for a game that was to be dedicated to Willie and still will be.\u201d San Francisco Mayor London Breed remembered Mays on Tuesday as \u201cthe best there ever was.\u201d \u201cHe was from a generation who faced segregation and racism, a generation that paved the way so that many of us could have the freedom to thrive,\u201d Breed said. CNN\u2019s Ray Sanchez, Wayne Sterling and Kevin Dotson contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/sport/willie-mays-negro-league-tribute-game/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "sports"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_sport_euro-2024-georgia-underdogs-coach-spt-intl", "text": "As Nika Kvekveskiri stepped up to the penalty spot, he had the expectations of a nation weighing heavily on his shoulders. Score and Georgia would qualify for Euro 2024; miss and it might be yet another story of heartbreak for this generation of fans to live through. As the midfielder started his run-up, assistant coach David Webb held his breath, tightly huddled together with the rest of the team. The entire nation watched as Kvekveskiri stuttered on his approach to the ball, before releasing a shot into the bottom left corner. \u201cYou could feel a pin drop in the stadium and then, when he put it in the bottom corner, it erupted,\u201d Georgia\u2019s assistant coach Webb tells CNN Sport, recalling the moment the nation qualified for Euro 2024 with a penalty shootout win against Greece \u2013 the first major tournament it has ever reached. \u201cStaff were crying. Players were crying. Fans bombarded the pitch. It was quite emotional.\u201d The winning spot-kick sparked jubilant scenes \ufeffinside Tbilisi\u2019s Boris Paichadze Dinamo Arena, as fans flooded onto the pitch and players celebrated in the dressing room. Webb smiles as he remembers those chaotic scenes of unbridled joy back in late March, laughing as he tries to recall which songs the players sang as they partied through the night. The excitement spread up and down the football-mad country and the anticipation has continued building ahead of the tournament\u2019s start in Germany on June 14. For Webb, it was a moment that he will never forget, and the \u201csurreal\u201d outcome has continued to provide memories that will last a lifetime \u2013 he\u2019s even in the process of getting an honorary Georgian passport. Helping Georgia qualify for Euro 2024 is the latest highlight in Webb\u2019s unique coaching career, a journey which has taken some unlikely twists and turns over the years. Watching football on a \u2018chess board\u2019 After realizing he wasn\u2019t quite good enough to forge a career as a top-flight player, Englishman Webb quickly made his name as a coach, impressing in a number of different roles \u2013 including youth coach and recruiter \u2013 at a host of professional English clubs. It was always the psychological side of the game that fascinated Webb most, an ability that enabled him to spot a player\u2019s potential where others could not. \u201cAnyone can pick the best players,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me, it was always about scratching under the surface a little bit. What makes [players] tick, what makes them develop.\u201d Webb is different from many other coaches in the world of football. He is softly spoken, unassuming and doesn\u2019t come with the usual bravado which is prevalent in a sport full of egos. Rather than looking purely at tactics and statistics \u2013 elements that are still important to his philosophy \u2013 he is more interested in fostering healthy relationships and creating environments for players to flourish. It\u2019s an approach rooted in his ability to empathize with people and something he credits to being slightly neurodiverse as a child. \u201cI had a sort of feeling and affiliation towards people and I always found football quite easy to watch,\u201d Webb says. \u201cI was watching games like a chess board, like a helicopter over the game. It was sort of a feeling and intuition with people. I kind of found I was getting a lot of this right over the years, especially when it comes to football and spotting talent.\u201d Webb decided to enhance this natural ability and obtained a postgraduate degree in sport psychology. Understanding the \u201chumanistic\u201d side of football, he says, is something that gives him an extra edge in his coaching career. Then, when a frustrating spell as manager of non-league club York City ended in disappointment in 2023, Webb got the chance to prove himself on the biggest stage. As chance would have it, Webb had briefly met former France international Willy Sagnol while on scouting duties in France in 2014. The pair hit it off and kept in contact over the years, with Sagnol impressed with the different way in which Webb sees the game. After Sagnol was appointed manager of the Georgian men\u2019s national team in 2021 and, after Webb found himself at a loose end, he was offered the chance to become one of the team\u2019s assistant coaches. Emotional Euro 2024 campaign It was an opportunity Webb couldn\u2019t turn down, a chance to work with an exciting generation who had their hearts set on qualification to Euro 2024. His remit was broad, tasked not only with helping to coach the players but also strengthening them mentally. He first set up one-to-one interviews with all the players to learn more about their personal journeys and to understand what they needed to maximize their potential. He says some players became emotional during these informal chats, thankful for the opportunity to speak about their lives in a sport where people are often treated as numbers, rather than humans. Webb then continued his work on the training field, looking for players who possessed character traits that would enable the team to do something it had never done before: reach a major tournament. Webb says he was surprised by what he saw in those early sessions, as he started to learn more about the culture of the country he was starting to represent. \u201cIt was just quite unique. All the players are the same, whether they\u2019re the biggest stars, they\u2019re all the same, the staff are all the same,\u201d he adds. \u201cThey\u2019re very humble, all of them, very passionate, very sensitive as well. Quite emotional but such pride for their country. I\u2019d never seen that before.\u201d After getting to know the players better, Webb continued to work on the mental aspect of their game, something which may have been a secret weapon in the penalty shootout win against Greece. In training before the play-off campaign, which saw the team beat Luxembourg in the semifinals before knocking out 2004 Euro champion Greece, Webb says the team specifically practiced the walk up to the penalty spot. The infamous few seconds in football can either make or break a player, and Webb believes the more you practice it, the easier it will be. Before the play-off games, Webb also delivered a presentation about focus to the entire squad, something which drew inspiration from elite athletes in other sports, as well as the national team\u2019s own journey. \u201cIt was good to deliver that,\u201d Webb says. \u201cYou could see the players\u2019 faces, a few tears were around. \u201cYou could feel that it was locked in, you know, that everything was calm, pure focus. Training was good. The players were ready.\u201d Now qualified for the tournament in Germany, Georgia is ready to continue surprising people when competition gets underway. The team boasts a selection of real talent, led by the likes of Napoli winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia. Despite being an underdog in the tournament, Webb is confident this team can compete in its group alongside Turkey, Portugal and Czech Republic. \u201cWe\u2019re not there just to be tourists,\u201d he says, leaning on similar comments made by Sagnol earlier in the year. \u201cWe want to go and compete and give our best. We think we\u2019ve got a fighting chance within the group to maybe progress to the next round. We\u2019re not going in there just to take part. \u201cWe looked at our squad, we looked at the other squads and we think, you know, we can be seriously competitive here.\u201d Georgia\u2019s first game will come against Turkey on June 18. On a personal note, though, Webb can scarcely believe the direction his life and career have taken after that chance encounter with Sagnol all those years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s quite surreal,\u201d Webb says, eyes full of excitement at the prospect of coaching Georgia at the pinnacle of European football.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/sport/euro-2024-georgia-underdogs-coach-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "sports"}}
