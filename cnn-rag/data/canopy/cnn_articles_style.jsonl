{"id": "2024_05_22_style_china-rihanna-fenty-beauty-promotion-intl-hnk", "text": "There\u2019s a reason why Rihanna is a billionaire. She\u2019s a business mogul in every sense: Aside from a prolific music career, she\u2019s launched successful brands including her cosmetics empire Fenty Beauty \u2013 worth an estimated $2.8 billion according to Forbes \u2013 and her lingerie label Savage X Fenty. Her latest move in China to promote makeup products is something of a masterclass in how to tap into its lucrative \u2013 mostly online \u2013 Gen Z market. On Tuesday night, the chart-topping singer attended a Fenty Beauty pop-up held at a Shanghai photography museum, \u201cservin\u2019 face\u201d according to brand\u2019s Instagram, and \u201cjianbing\u201d \u2013 a popular Chinese breakfast crepe that costs about a dollar. Dressed in a head-to-toe black ensemble, Rihanna cracked an egg, spread yolk, sprinkled scallions, brushed sauce and placed a crunchy cracker onto the savory street food favorite, made on a glittery food cart. Influential makeup bloggers invited to attend captured the spectacle and Chinese social media sprung to life. \u201cShe makes crepes but not her new album,\u201d joked one user on Douyin, China\u2019s TikTok, while another wrote on Weibo, \u201cShe\u2019s so good at it, it\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s her first time.\u201d Rihanna is already a beloved star in China, recently appearing on April\u2019s Vogue China cover. She has been viewed as appreciating Chinese culture, famously wearing a glorious golden yellow creation by master couturier Guo Pei to 2015\u2019s China-themed Met Gala. And the decision to serve up jianbing was a savvy move \u2013 one that embraced the star\u2019s moniker among Chinese fans and displayed knowledge of her audience. In 2011, Chinese fans dubbed her the \u201cQueen of Shandong,\u201d after her hit \u201cWe Found Love\u201d was phonetically translated to \u201cweifang de ai\u201d \u2013 meaning love of Weifang, a city in eastern China\u2019s Shandong province. Jianbing is believed to have originated from the same province more than 2,000 years ago and for many in China, the 36-year-old\u2019s turn at making the humble crepe was a full circle moment, with one viral comment on Weibo reading \u201cshe\u2019s certified her own Chinese nickname\u201d with the act. The jianbing buzz only added to the chatter online about the singer\u2019s appearance earlier in the day on Douyin, where she hosted three livestream sessions showcasing Fenty Beauty lip glosses, blushes and other products. Rihanna then became the number one trending topic on Weibo, with the hashtag #RihannasfirstlivestreaminChina viewed over 81 million times. Another hashtag, #RihannashowsupinShanghai was viewed over 75 million times. Besides being a video app, Douyin is a major platform for online shopping \u2013 with products and discounts displayed on-screen during livestreams and purchases just a swipe or a click away. In 2022, there were more than 460 million livestreaming e-commerce users in mainland China, according to the Academy of China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, a body affiliated with Beijing\u2019s commerce ministry. Other foreign luxury brands have already hosted their own livestream sessions, including Gucci, Dior and Louis Vuitton. China is now the world\u2019s second largest beauty market. Rihanna\u2019s appearance was part of the platform\u2019s wider \u201c618\u201d (or June 18) campaign, one of China\u2019s most important online shopping events after Singles Day in November, that sees widespread promotions starting nearly a month ahead. While Fenty Beauty products have been available in the country since 2019, the brand announced this March that it would be expanding its presence via Sephora stores on the mainland. In 2017, the brand launched with an unprecedented 40 shades of foundation and has since added more. Its outsized profitability has dramatically shifted the beauty landscape, with many companies now offering their own more diverse and inclusive range of cosmetics.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/style/china-rihanna-fenty-beauty-promotion-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_style_india-elections-purple-voter-ink-intl-hnk", "text": "India\u2019s massive, twice-a-decade exercise in democracy is once again leaving its mark on the country\u2019s people, in the form of purple-streaked index fingers. The Election Commission uses indelible ink, or \u201cvoter ink\u201d, to prevent fraud or duplicate votes. Once a voter arrives at the booth to cast their ballot and has their ID verified, the ink is painted across the top of their left index finger, leaving a stain that can take up to two weeks to wash off. It may be rudimentary, but the method has been so effective that it\u2019s been in place for more than seven decades. \u201cRight from the prime minister to the most common person, everybody flashes their (marked) finger,\u201d said K Mohammed Irfan, managing director of Mysore Varnish and Paints Limited (MVPL), the state-owned company that exclusively makes and distributes the liquid to polling booths across the nation. \u201cFrom celebrities to film stars\u2026 (it has become) a mark of democracy that I think is synonymous with elections,\u201d he told CNN in a video interview. More than 960 million people are eligible to vote in India\u2019s election, the world\u2019s biggest. And workers at the company\u2019s factory in Mysuru, a city in southwestern Karnataka state, have spent months preparing nearly 2.7 million ink\u00a0vials, its largest order to date. The orange containers were filled and carefully packed for distribution ahead of this year\u2019s elections, which are underway and end\u00a0June 1. Each vial contains enough liquid to mark approximately 700 voters. The key to the ink\u2019s literal staying power? A tightly guarded formula which has remained unchanged since 1951. \u201cIndelible ink serves no other purpose,\u201d said Irfan. \u201cWe only manufacture the required quantity.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0While Irfan says the company is \u201cbound to secrecy\u201d when it comes to the ink\u2019s exact composition, it does contain the chemical compound silver nitrate, which causes a purplish stain when it comes into contact with skin and is exposed to sunlight. One dab at a time When newly independent India held its first-ever general elections in 1951 and 1952, organizers turned to the idea of using indelible ink to mark voters, in efforts to ensure a fair ballot. \u201cIn a country where there was no systematic registration of births, or identity documents, and with millions of people on the move as refugees, the question of how to prevent impersonation and double voting was a source of great concern,\u201d said Ornit Shani, author of \u201cHow India Became Democratic: Citizenship and the Making of the Universal Franchise.\u201d Some officials thought the method would take too much time and complicate the voting process, according to Shani, but public opinion eventually won out. \u201cCombined with the practice that all voters, irrespective of their caste, class and religions would stand in the same line, (having to wait) for their turn to have their finger marked (before they) cast their vote, further contributed to making concrete and visible the core value of the equality of the vote,\u201d Shani said in an email to CNN. \u201cOne man, one woman, one vote.\u201d Lasting appeal MVPL was founded as a paint supplier in 1937 by the then maharaja or ruler of Mysore, Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV, and retains that side\u00a0of its business. According to Irfan, when the company isn\u2019t producing ink, it\u2019s supplying, among other products, paint for the public transport sector. The ink\u2019s appeal has spilled beyond India\u2019s borders too. The company now supplies indelible ink to more than 35 countries, including to Ghana beginning in the late 1970s. However, Ghana\u2019s election commission recently announced it would phase out the use of indelible ink, opting for biometric verification methods instead. But the use of the ink in India doesn\u2019t appear to be going away any time soon. For Mukulika Banerjee, an associate professor of anthropology at the London School of Economics, the practice of marking a body may not translate well in other cultures, but it works in India due to common\u00a0cultural practices. \u201cPeople routinely have their hands decorated with henna, or women have their feet decorated with different colors,\u201d said Banerjee in a phone interview. \u201cI would argue that the marking of the finger (semi-permanently) kind of fits into it in a way that it might not fit in other contexts.\u201d She also pointed to an unintentional effect of marking voters with ink: creating an environment of peer pressure. Banerjee was able to find instances of this during her research on democracy and elections in West Bengal. \u201cFirst thing on polling day people do is check out each other\u2019s fingers,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if your left index finger is not carrying the indelible mark, they\u2019ll look at you and the first thing they\u2019ll say is \u2018Why haven\u2019t you voted?\u2019 \u201cYou can make excuses, but by the fifth time in the day, if somebody asks you and it gets so annoying, it\u2019s actually easier to go and vote than to not vote.\u201d The peer pressure extends to movie stars and athletes, who are likely to post their ink-stained fingers to their millions of fans on social media. \u201cThese guys have begun to hold up (their fingers) and take selfies of having voted and say \u2018I\u2019ve voted, have you?\u2019 because they feel they have a civic duty to encourage others to vote as well,\u201d she added. \u201cSo it becomes aspirational; then you want to be like your hero and you want to be able to do the same thing.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/india-elections-purple-voter-ink-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}

Roberts, an actor who has become a mainstay of rom coms and campy horror \u2014 the latter, most recently with recurring roles in the anthology series \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d \u2014 bought the home, which she shares with her three-year-old son Rhodes, in 2022 and hired the design firm Pierce & Ward to overhaul its interiors. In the May issue of Architectural Digest, she reveals the results of that makeover. For Roberts, having a space that feels like home is a particular priority, she explained, as she moved often as a child. So when she saw the property listed as a rental on Instagram (it has been reported as a former residence of Minnie Driver), she inquired if she could purchase it instead. \u201cI think I lived in 10 houses by the time I was 15 \u2014 so for me now, having a son, I wanted a place that felt really ours.\u201d she told AD. \u201cI have a picture of the day we moved in\u2026 I just remember feeling like we are exactly where we need to be.\u201d The designers, Louisa Pierce and Emily Ward, with whom Roberts had previously worked, are known for down-to-earth spaces that mix bohemian, mid-century modern and rustic styles. Their clients have included Roberts\u2019 \u201cMadame Web\u201d co-star Dakota Johnson as well as Kate Hudson and Leonardo DiCaprio. \u201cWe want a house to look like it\u2019s been there for 50 years,\u201d Pierce told AD in the cover story. \u201cWe never want a home to look new.\u201d In that spirit, much of Roberts\u2019 furniture, art and decor is repurposed or reupholstered. In the living room, beneath a disco ball-like globe light, paperbacks are enclosed in living room cabinets while rarer books are openly displayed. Framed photographs of Debbie Harry and Joni Mitchell rest on wooden cabinets; elsewhere, one of Roberts\u2019 most treasured artworks \u2014 a Julian Wasser portrait of Joan Didion in front of a Corvette \u2014 hangs on the wall. Though many pieces are courtesy of design studios or antique finds, Pierce and Ward don\u2019t look down on more accessible commercial brands. Roberts recalled when she asked if her new kitchen island was custom-made, they laughed and said it was from Urban Outfitters. As for a room for Rhodes, who is starting his own book collection, Roberts opted for a soothing wallpaper scene of flying ducks on the ceiling, above a lush forest-themed upholstered bed. \u201cI remember as a kid, whatever\u2019s on your wall and your ceiling is seared into your brain for the rest of your life,\u201d Roberts explained. \u201cSo I wanted to make it extra cozy and fun, but not too overwhelming.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/16/style/emma-roberts-la-home-architectural-digest/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}

Sporting categories were twinned with time periods, and while dancers re-enacted the careful choreography of 1960s fencing or 1970s gymnastics, models strutted alongside in loosely corresponding looks. But a catwalk filled with leggings and track shorts, this was not. One of the most surprising ensembles came from Katy Perry, in an archival Noir Kei Ninomiya cut-out gown for the show\u2019s section on 1980s martial arts.

Perry wasn\u2019t the only A-lister flirting with a state of undress. Jared Leto, too, arrived at Vogue World in a transparent sleeveless tunic and a pair of black briefs.

Margot Friedl\u00e4nder, n\u00e9e Bendheim, was born in Berlin in 1921. According to a brief bio on the website of Berlin\u2019s Jewish Museum, Friedl\u00e4nder spent the early part of the war with her mother and younger brother Ralph after her parents separated. They had plans to flee the country but in 1943 her brother was arrested by the Gestapo. Their mother confronted the Gestapo, which led to her being deported to Auschwitz with her son, where they were both murdered. But before leaving, she left behind a message for her daughter that read: \u201cTry to make your life.\u201d Friedl\u00e4nder, then just 21 years old, went into hiding but was ultimately betrayed by \u201ccatchers\u201d and was sent to Theresienstadt camp in the then-Nazi occupied Czechoslovakia in 1944, according to the museum. In her interview with Vogue Germany, Friedl\u00e4nder said: \u201cI am grateful. Grateful that I made it. For being able to fulfill my mother\u2019s wish. That I have made my life.\u201d Vogue Germany said they\u2019d met with Friedl\u00e4nder four times this year and that the cover pictures were shot in April at the Botanical Garden in Berlin. Kerstin Weng, head of editorial content at the magazine, said that the theme of the issue was love, featuring their \u201cfavorite pieces, favorite people.\u201d The front of the collector\u2019s issue includes the word \u201clove\u201d written by Friedl\u00e4nder, as well as her signature. The multi-page piece, which includes numerous shots of Friedl\u00e4nder, covers a range of topics, from growing up in Nazi Germany to her commitment as a Holocaust survivor today. Weng said: \u201cThe most positive person I know is on this issue\u2019s cover: Margot Friedl\u00e4nder. To many she is known as a Holocaust survivor. But she not only survived the Nazis, she also overcame betrayal and loss. She would have all reason to be bitter, but remains open-minded and refuses to take sides. She stands up against forgetting and for humanity and togetherness. \u201cAt 102, she seeks to engage with the younger generation and proves that dialogue is still possible.\u201d \u2018Carry my story onward\u2019 Friedl\u00e4nder met her future husband, Adolf, while in the Nazi concentration camp, and married him soon after liberation. The pair emigrated to the US in 1946 and lived in New York for more than six decades. But in 2010, following her husband\u2019s death aged 88, Friedl\u00e4nder moved back to Berlin. Ever since, she has been campaigning as a Holocaust educator. Her tireless efforts have earnt her numerous awards, including the Federal Cross of Merit First Class. Friedl\u00e4nder told Vogue Germany that she was \u201cappalled\u201d by the growth of right-wing populism and the rise of antisemitic attacks. When addressing the issue of society becoming more polarized, she said: \u201cLook not toward what separates us. Look towards what bring us together. Be People. Be sensible.\u201d Grateful for the opportunity to pass on her message, she said: \u201cYou will carry my story onward. That this never comes to happen again.\u201d Although more than 100 years old, Friedl\u00e4nder is not Vogue\u2019s oldest cover model.

{"id": "2024_03_29_style_kim-kardashian-donald-judd-furniture-cec", "text": "Kim Kardashian\u2019s oft-divisive interior design aesthetic is under new scrutiny. The estate of minimalist contemporary artist Donald Judd filed a lawsuit against Kardashian this week, claiming the fashion and beauty mogul promoted \u201ccheap knockoffs\u201d of his furniture designs. The basis of the suit is a 2022 video Kardashian posted to YouTube, in which she gives a guided tour of the offices for her then-brand new makeup company, Skkn by Kim. (The video, which the suit alleged received some 3.7 million views, was seemingly made private following the lawsuit filing.) While touting her office\u2019s minimalist design, Kardashian specifically praises a sleek, large-scale wooden table with a set of matching chairs that are perfectly sized to slide beneath \u2014 creating a piece resembling less a dining table and more a brutalist sculpture. \u201cThese Donald Judd tables are really amazing and totally blend in with the seats,\u201d Kardashian says, moving a chair out to show the camera. An artist and sculptor, Judd was known for his minimalist designs emphasizing clean whole shapes and industrial materials. As they appear in the video, the table and its matching chairs in Kardashian\u2019s office resemble Judd\u2019s famous La Mansana Table and Chair 84 \u2014 pieces that have become iconic among furniture designers and collectors since they were first produced in 1982. The Judd Foundation still manufactures and sells these designs, though they come at a cost: the table is priced at $90,000, while the chairs retail for $9,000 each. But Kardashian\u2019s wares were not authentic pieces, the Judd Foundation wrote in the lawsuit filed Wednesday against both Kardashian and Clements Design, the interior design firm she worked with in designing the Skkn office space. (And even if they were, the foundation \u201ccategorically prohibits customers from using purchased Donald Judd furniture for marketing and promotional purposes,\u201d it says in its court filing.) The foundation is claiming trademark infringement, copyright infringement, unfair competition, false advertising and false endorsement of the knockoff items. \u201cConsumers who watched the video or read the media coverage were misled to believe Ms. Kardashian\u2019s tables and chairs were authentic Donald Judd pieces,\u201d the foundation states in the filing. It is seeking the profits it argues Kardashian and Clements Design made off the use of Judd\u2019s name. Clements Designs, according to the court filing, said it never claimed the tables and chairs were authentic Judd pieces, and directed the foundation to settle the issue with Kardashian. In a statement provided to CNN, the design firm said the pieces it produced for Kardashian\u2019s office had \u201cobvious key differences\u201d to Judd\u2019s designs. \u201cThe Judd Foundation\u2019s prior counsel acknowledged these differences and since then, we have not heard from them in over a year, and are now being blindsided with a lawsuit,\u201d Clements Design\u2019s statement read. \u201cEfforts were made to resolve this issue amicably at the time and the Judd Foundation was unwilling to settle on reasonable terms. These claims have absolutely no merit.\u201d To add further insult, Kardashian\u2019s knockoffs were also, the lawsuit claims, seemingly made from plywood \u2014 a material that the Judd Foundation does not authorize.\u201d \u201cThese poor-quality imitations masquerading as authentic Donald Judd tables and chairs harm the Donald Judd brand,\u201d the lawsuit argues. \u201cConsumers will see the cheap knockoffs\u2026 and erroneously associate (the) low-grade pieces with the Donald Judd brand,\u201d the lawsuit states. The foundation claimed it also offered to replace the counterfeit tables and chairs with authentic pieces at a discount if Kardashian issued a retraction and edited the video, the lawsuit claims. Representatives for Kardashian offered to promote the Judd Foundation in a social media post, which the foundation rejected, and also offered to issue a retraction in the video caption, but not remove the video, the lawsuit claims. Kardashian did not respond to requests for comment from CNN. Judd, who died in 1994, was very selective about who was allowed to manufacture and carry his designs, paying particularly close attention to the quality of materials used. Only a few galleries and stores \u2014 like the MoMA Design store and the Salon 94 gallery, both in New York \u2014 are authorized to sell his furniture.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/29/style/kim-kardashian-donald-judd-furniture-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}

The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through\u00a0the building \u2013 known locally as B\u00f8rsen \u2013\u00a0from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen\u00a0police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a \u201ccomplicated process.\u201d Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already \u201cconducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.\u201d \u201cBut of course, there is still a lot to do, especially as we have not yet had the opportunity to examine\u00a0B\u00f8rsen itself,\u201d Belling added. The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. \u201cMy first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be the same but it\u2019s iconic to\u00a0Copenhagen\u00a0and Denmark,\u201d teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters. Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, told the news agency that a firefighter gave him the top of the spire on Wednesday morning after it was recovered following its fall. \u201cIt gives me hope because we have decided to rebuild the stock exchange because it\u2019s part of European history as a trading continent,\u201d he said. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. It has been at the heart of Danish business since then; while it no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, it serves as the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday a \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d was on fire, calling the building \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt added that 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/17/style/copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}

When we all got home Elvis called some of us upstairs and was giving away some of his clothes he didn\u2019t think he would be wearing or wanted when he came back from the army. That night Elvis gave me these blue suede shoes size 10 1/2. I\u2019ve owned these all these years,\u201d the letter continues. The auction will go live on Friday. Bidding for the shoes, which are described as \u201can iconic lot of showbusiness memorabilia that simply transcends 20th\u00a0century popular culture,\u201d starts at \u00a355,000 (around $69,600).", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/style/elvis-actual-blue-suede-shoes-up-for-auction-intl-scli-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_style_martine-rose-brings-a-slice-of-london-to-milan-fashion-week", "text": "With flyers strewn across the floor, metal barriers covered in recycled plastic, and a sporadic assembly of plastic chairs arranged in dimly-lit arts space south of central Milan, British menswear designer Martine Rose eschewed the polish often associated with the Italian fashion capital, giving guests a taste of her native North London\u2019s gritty charm instead. \u201cI wanted it to be a bit of a mess,\u201d said Rose ahead of the show on Sunday that marked her debut on the Milan Fashion Week schedule after years presenting her label in London. \u201cI want people to go in into it and there be this beauty but not in a [instantly] recognizable [way].\u201d This subverted starting point is a longstanding signature of Rose\u2019s brand and one that has no doubt contributed to her being one of the most sought-after and influential designers of her generation. In addition to running her business \u2014 one that remained independent since its launch in 2007 until The Tomorrow Group invested in 2021 \u2014 she has consulted behind the scenes for prominent fashion houses including Balenciaga, been shortlisted for the prestigious LVMH Fashion Prize, among many others, and picked up the coveted Menswear Designer of The Year trophy at the 2023 Fashion Awards. For her Spring-Summer 2025 show, she continued to challenge traditional concepts of masculinity and classic codes of tailoring. Dedicated to \u201cexpressions of beauty spawned from the likes of disturbance, humour, and sex,\u201d according to show notes, the collection saw whipstitched T-shirts worn with tartan shorts and fishnet socks; a \u201cparty shirt\u201d featuring the headshots of Rose\u2019s studio team and their families; and tailoring taken out of proportion with nipped-in waists and broad-shouldered blazers worn with leather pants featuring front zips \u201cfor easy access.\u201d \u201cThere is a familiar subversion but I never intend for things to be shocking,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe things that I put on the on the catwalk I genuinely think are real proposals for men.\u201d Case in point, the sporty polo shirts and hot-pink cagoules that came perfectly tucked into pencil skirts. \u201cThere\u2019s something somehow more radical in a man wearing a pencil skirt and I\u2019m curious as to why, because there\u2019s nothing particularly radical about the sober length and we see Bermuda shorts and kilts of that length,\u201d said Rose. \u201cThese are the questions that I find really interesting, not about gender but about clothes. And the men look amazing in it.\u201d In a further twist, prosthetic noses were administered to every model, each of whom had been street cast in Milan. Rose does this for all her shows, reemphasising the importance of the \u201clocal hero,\u201d a phrase that appeared as logos on baseball caps and silk ties. Milan is something of a fitting host for Rose\u2019s brand with the two sharing a sense of intrigue on first impression. While Milan\u2019s austere architecture famously conceals its hidden gardens and a warm hospitality, the confronting setting and external attitude of Rose\u2019s catwalk shows are portals to a creative conversation that has community at its heart. As Rose notes of Milan, \u201cit reveals itself slowly\u201d. That Rose opted to show her collection in Milan this season (off the back of showing in Florence and Paris previously) as opposed to London, deals another blow to the British Fashion Council\u2019s (BFC) menswear schedule that was once a hotbed of emerging talent but has lost a number of key brands including JW Anderson, A-Cold-Wall and Wales Bonner, to other fashion weeks over the last six years. \u201cYou would think that I would come back and appreciate London more, but actually it makes me realise what London has lost and continues to lose,\u201d she said in reference to what she sees as a lack of investment in the industry. \u201cEvery other European city seems to take [creativity] seriously and that makes me sad. And then of course, layer on Brexit, and it\u2019s actually a disaster for all of the creative sector.\u201d Despite the direct value of the UK fashion industry to the UK economy standing at nearly \u00a321 billion (approximately $27 billion), according to the BFC, and fashion graduates taking top positions at international fashion houses for decades, Rose said, \u201cit\u2019s incredibly infuriating and depressing that it\u2019s not taken seriously. As soon as you get any particular type of sort of success and recognition, you have to move to Paris or Italy to get seen, the natural thing is to leave London and that\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d \u201cThere are [designers] doing really interesting stuff, it\u2019s just that they get no support from anywhere else to do it,\u201d she continued. \u201cRents are impossible, they get no subsidies\u2026it\u2019s off people\u2019s own bat, which is really hard to sustain.\u201d Following the rapturous reception at Sunday\u2019s show, it appears that London\u2019s loss is Milan\u2019s gain.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/style/martine-rose-brings-a-slice-of-london-to-milan-fashion-week/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2023_07_03_style_felipe-romero-beltran-dialect-spain-migration", "text": "Photographer Felipe Romero Beltr\u00e1n\u2019s depiction of a migrant facility in Spain oozes with the boredom and malaise of life in legal limbo. His young subjects are seen smoking cigarettes, lifting weights and trimming one another\u2019s hair. Other images show them hanging out in a grubby yard or lying around on mattresses. The photos were shot with the help of nine young Moroccans whom Beltr\u00e1n befriended in Seville, capital of the southern region of Andaluc\u00eda. Published in his new book \u201cDialect,\u201d the pictures were initially intended to be personal, not political. But they ultimately spoke to what Beltr\u00e1n called a \u201cKafka-esque\u201d system in which the men waited for years to learn whether their residency applications would be approved. \u201cAt the beginning, it was just about this group of guys,\u201d Beltr\u00e1n said on a video call from Madrid. \u201cBut of course, I realized that I was photographing these really specific political bodies, or political subjects in this bureaucracy.\u201d Last year, nearly 30,000 migrants arrived in Spain by sea, down from a record of over 58,000 in 2018, according to UNHCR data. Of these, most arrived in the Canary Islands or Andaluc\u00eda, a region separated from Morocco by the Strait of Gibraltar, a stretch of water just 13 kilometers (eight miles) at its narrowest. The nine men, who didn\u2019t previously know one another, were among those to arrive by boat during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic in search of a better life. Recounting his journey with an essay in \u201cDialect,\u201d one of Beltr\u00e1n\u2019s subjects, Youssef Elhafidi, recalls another terrified teen migrant being forced by smugglers to pilot their boat. \u201cHe did not want to drive, the fear was paralyzing him, they took out a knife and put it on his neck, threatening him to start the engines,\u201d Elhafidi wrote. \u201cThe boy started the machine between trembling and crying and we headed north.\u201d Killing time According to Beltr\u00e1n, his nine subjects were required to stay in Spain for three continuous years before applying for residency. Undocumented and without the right to work during this time, they were dependent on the state for food and housing. While living at the government-run facility, the men took Spanish lessons and joined workshops to help them adapt to life in Spain \u2014 some of which were run by Beltr\u00e1n. Overcoming an initial language barrier, the photographer began working with the group to produce images and videos. As well as candid portraits, the pictures focus on conditions at the facility, from peeling walls to basic food supplies. Many of the images were, however, staged. As Beltr\u00e1n looked for different ways to engage with his subjects, he asked them to re-enact moments from their respective migration journeys. In one, a subject lies motionless on blue gym mats, just as he had upon landing on Spain\u2019s coast. Another shows two of the men carrying a third on their shoulders to recreate the moment he fainted during a day-long walk to Seville from a small town to its south. The resulting book is thus part documentary and part performance, with Beltr\u00e1n toeing the line between mentor and collaborator, photographer and choreographer. More than just an artistic decision, staging photos directly responded to the tedium of the migrants\u2019 abundant free time. \u201cThere was an activity around taking the images \u2014 it was something during the day that (could get them) excited. And it was fun,\u201d Beltr\u00e1n recalled. \u201cEveryone was laughing, and they just make jokes each other during the sessions.\u201d Lost in translation When Beltr\u00e1n began delivering workshops at the facility in 2020, he was all too familiar with the system his subjects were trapped in. A few years earlier, he had relocated to Spain from his native Colombia, and \u2014 even as a college-educated Spanish speaker \u2014 also struggled to navigate the complex immigration processes. To illustrate the challenge facing his francophone subjects, his project included a video titled \u201cRecital\u201d in which they attempted to read the first four pages of the Spanish immigration law that would determine their futures. \u201cThey weren\u2019t understanding a word,\u201d he recalled, noting that, although lawyers were assigned to act on the men\u2019s behalf, the language barrier and dense legalese removed their agency. The opening pages of \u201cDialect\u201d \u2014 whose title alludes to these very linguistical challenges \u2014 are dedicated to stills from the video. Pictures of the men struggling to comprehend the legislation are overlaid with technical terminology (\u201cRight to effective judicial protection\u201d reads the text on one frame; another says, \u201cAuthorizations for the purpose of carrying out profit-making activities\u201d). \u201cThese legal procedures are really, really complicated, even for native speakers,\u201d said Beltr\u00e1n, who is now completing a PhD program in photography in Madrid. \u201cIt becomes almost like translation work \u2014 translating these laws and bureaucracies into (something understandable to) normal people like us.\u201d The result, he said, is an inevitable sense of helplessness. \u201cYou can\u2019t talk with anyone,\u201d Beltr\u00e1n added. \u201cYou can\u2019t ask, \u2018Who is the law?\u2019 or \u2018Who is the state?\u2019 You don\u2019t have anyone to approach. You don\u2019t have any tools to make a living\u2026 The system is built to avoid you, or to deny you access to (it).\u201d Describing the group as \u201cjust young people trying to figure out what to do with life,\u201d the photographer hopes his project can humanize migrants\u2019 experiences in a world increasingly desensitized to images of their suffering. Since Beltr\u00e1n completed his project, most of his subjects have completed their three-year wait and now formally reside in Spain, he says. He remains in touch with some \u2014 including Elhafidi, who he says works in a restaurant and has accompanied him at promotional events for the book\u2019s launch. In the conclusion of his essay, Elhafidi recalled how he felt when he secured his residency, writing: \u201cIt took me three years of searching and putting courage to life, until finally the moment came, after being cold, scared, hungry and the most difficult thing, my mother\u2019s tears\u2026 I got it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI got the papers. Now after getting it I have another look at life, I finally feel that I have the opportunity to be whoever I want to be.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re building their lives,\u201d Beltr\u00e1n said of those, including Elhafidi, who have secured residency. \u201cFortunately, they now can go back to Morocco to visit and see their families.\u201d \u201cDialect,\u201d published by Loose Joints, is available now.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/07/03/style/felipe-romero-beltran-dialect-spain-migration/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_06_02_style_tschabalala-self-artist-painting-black-bodies", "text": "Both a source of inspiration and a place to ground herself, Harlem holds a special meaning for the artist Tschabalala Self. \u201cIt definitely sculpted my personal worldview,\u00a0style and perspective,\u201d said Self of the Manhattan neighborhood, her hometown, famed for fostering generations of Black creatives, artists and intellectuals. \u201cIt\u2019s this world within the world of New York, the largest and most vibrant city in the world. I\u2019ve always been very proud to be from Harlem.\u201d This pride is most recently manifested in her latest exhibition, \u201cAround the Way,\u201d currently on show at the Espoo Museum of Modern Art, Finland. The show\u2019s title is a nod to Black American slang, referring \u201cto someone who\u2019s from our neighborhood,\u201d she told CNN. From referencing the brownstone brick-patterned architecture to real-life friends, family and local residents, the works on display serve as Self\u2019s homage \u2014 and tribute \u2014 to her Harlem. Self has become known in particular, perhaps, for featuring fuller figured Black women in her artworks, and incorporating sewn fabric and printmaking techniques. The Black female body is \u201cmy visual language, my visual aesthetic,\u201d she explained. \u201cThat\u2019s my muse.\u201d Her work has been shown at institutions including MoMA PS1 in New York City, LA\u2019s Hammer Museum, and London\u2019s Parasol unit \u2014 and on numerous occasions in Harlem-based galleries. As a multidisciplinary creative, she works across fields including sculpture, performance, fashion and more, and is also as editor-in-chief at arts and visual culture magazine Elephant. Yet she\u2019s most at home describing herself as a painter, and credits her training in printmaking as heavily influencing her practice. \u201cI personally think of painting as being more of a philosophy than a literal application of paint,\u201d she said of her work, which is rooted in how different colors relate to each other. This relationship can then be replicated through other mixed media, including fabrics. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to think about new and innovative ways to approach painting\u2026 I describe it more as assemblage because the fabric is so dimensional,\u201d she explained of the appliqu\u00e9 techniques in which she works with fabrics on stretched canvas. \u201cSimilar to how other painters have a palette, I have hundreds of bits and scraps of fabrics\u2026 It\u2019s basically an accumulation of all my different fragmented memories or impressions from individuals that I knew well, or that I just happened upon,\u201d she continued. \u201c\u201cThrough the formal aspects of my work, I\u2019m able to address my central conceptual concern that one\u2019s identity is really the sum of many parts. Some of these parts are inherent, but others are projected and collected.\u201d This sense of collecting and gathering is epitomized in a piece in the new show, titled \u201cAnthurium.\u201d The work blends sewn, painted and printed elements to create a scene of domesticity \u2014 a key focal point of Self\u2019s work previously explored in her \u201cHome Body\u201d series, which depicted scenes of intimacy and interiority. Self\u2019s own relationship with the concept of home has evolved in recent years. Now based in upstate New York, the process of leaving her childhood home prompted her to investigate the significance of domestic spaces, both real and imagined. \u201cI think that the home is an actual site, but it also occupies an emotional and psychological space in people\u2019s minds,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s symbolic of something other than what it really is in reality, and those are the kind of environments I like to explore in my artwork.\u201d When considering Self\u2019s body of work on display in \u201cAround the Way,\u201d and more broadly, it\u2019s also clear that the physical body embodies a further exploration of \u201chome\u201d as a place of belonging, of community and of self-care. Her figures are as at home in their physicality as they are  in the world. She describes her approach to rendering and depicting Black women in particular as \u201can instinct,\u201d but she says that she was able to articulate this further through researching the significance of the Rubenesque figure. \u201cIt was interesting to me that the women had this physical aesthetic that was speaking to their abundance and plentitude. They did not have any need,\u201d she said. In her own practice then, this sense of abundance shows up in the way Self\u2019s characters boldly claim space within the picture frame, with their power rooted in their identity, femininity and physicality. This conversation with the traditional western canon of painting is ongoing for Self, and influences other facets of her work. In March 2024, Self was awarded the prestigious public art commission for London\u2019s Fourth Plinth \u2014 her sculpture, \u201cLady in Blue,\u201d will sit atop one of the plinths in Trafalgar Square, a landmark and tourist destination in the city also renowned for its commitment to highlighting contemporary art, starting in 2026. The piece will be a bronze statue of a Black woman striding in movement forward, wearing a bright blue dress. That color was inspired by lapis lazuli and ultramarine, a rare pigment used with significance in the western art canon. \u201cA lot of classical paintings have used lapis lazuli to denote a sense of honor and prestige to a revered figure. I wanted to use this color\u2026 to bestow that same significance.\u201d \u201cEspecially being an American artist, I think it\u2019s a great honor and I feel a lot of trust from the people of London,\u201d Self said. In thinking about the concept for \u201cLady in Blue,\u201d Self considered the increased attention on monuments, particularly in recent years. Instead of uplifting or exalting individuals, her preferred approach is to look to symbolic representations of shared identities and societies instead. But the commission also represents much more than the sculpture\u2019s identity or physicality alone, added the artist. \u201cIt\u2019s about having a figure that can simultaneously speak to the future and the past, and I honestly feel like a Black female figure is the best figure to do that for a number of cultural and historical reasons. \u2018Lady in Blue\u2019 can be seen as an historical mother, but also as a representation of our collective future.\u201d Tschabalala Self: Around the Way is presented in collaboration with the Saastamoinen Foundation at EMMA\u2013Espoo Museum of Modern Art from 8 May 2024 - 5 May 2025 as part of the In Collection exhibition series.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/style/tschabalala-self-artist-painting-black-bodies/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}

{"id": "2024_05_03_style_steve-mccurry-shaolin-monks-photo-intl-hnk-snap", "text": "A young Shaolin monk runs horizontally across a wall, intense concentration, and perhaps a hint of astonishment, visible in his face. Four other trainees at a martial arts academy near the Shaolin Temple in China\u2019s Henan province lounge nonchalantly, seemingly unaware of the gravity-defying action taking place above their heads. Their bright orange robes and\u00a0Feiyue\u00a0sneakers stand in contrast to the earthen wall behind them. The blurred back of a man on the left side of the image highlights the sharp movement at its center. A monk stretching in the background demonstrates his dexterity in a split-like stance. \u201cThere\u2019s this high-level action,\u201d photographer Steve McCurry told CNN of the photo\u2019s composition in a video call from his home in Philadelphia. \u201cAnd these other boys are just hanging out.\u201d The\u00a0image\u00a0is featured in Magnum\u2019s\u00a0Square Print Sale, which ends May 5,\u00a0alongside other photographers\u2019 works.\u00a0He shot it back in 2004,\u00a0as part of a personal project, while traveling the world to document various forms of Buddhism. While he doesn\u2019t consider himself to be Buddhist, McCurry has long been interested in the religion and applies some of its\u00a0principles to his own life. The Shaolin Temple \u2013 which was founded in\u00a0AD 495\u00a0on the slopes of the sacred Mount Song \u2013\u00a0is said to be the home of Chan Buddhism. Although the religion emphasizes nonviolence, the temple\u2019s warrior monks initially practiced martial arts to defend themselves from\u00a0bandits. Over time, their rigorous physical training became inexorably linked with their quest to achieve enlightenment. Today, Shaolin kung fu is widely known, and the monks\u2019 feats in athleticism have been emulated in popular movies.\u00a0The 1982 movie \u201cThe Shaolin Temple,\u201d which launched Jet Li\u2019s career and was filmed on location, was one of the films that brought renewed interest in the monastery. By the time McCurry visited in 2004,\u00a0dozens of martial arts schools had sprung up on the road leading up to the temple. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible to watch them perform and train,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine that people can actually do that with their bodies.\u201d A career on the road McCurry started his career working at a local newspaper after graduating from Pennsylvania State University. He then started traveling abroad as a freelance photographer, shooting images of people in some of the world\u2019s most dangerous and remote places. His career took off in earnest after he snuck across the border from Pakistan into Afghanistan in 1979, right before the Soviet invasion.\u00a0He smuggled film out\u00a0by hiding it in his clothing,\u00a0providing the world some of the first photos of the conflict that left at least 500,000 Afghans dead and millions displaced. His 1984\u00a0\u201cAfghan girl\u201d\u00a0photograph \u2013 which captured the piercing green eyes of a 12-year-old refugee in Peshawar, Pakistan and was featured on National Geographic magazine\u2019s June 1985 cover \u2013 is one of the world\u2019s most famous photos. Over the course of his 50-year career, McCurry,\u00a0now 74,\u00a0has filled more than 20 passports, snapping animals and festivals, worshippers and fighters,\u00a0conflicts\u00a0and catastrophes\u00a0in destinations from Niger to India.\u00a0He captures the ancient against the modern, the curious amid the day-to-day and accentuates the familiarity of strangers. In 2016, McCurry came under fire when one of his photos in an exhibition was discovered to be digitally altered. He\u00a0said\u00a0it had happened in his studio while he was out traveling, but more images that appeared to be manipulated began surfacing, igniting a debate around the ethics of photojournalism. In response\u00a0to the allegations, the photographer told Time magazine\u00a0later that year that beyond the\u00a0brief stint at the local newspaper in Pennsylvania, he had never been employed by a newspaper, news magazine or news outlet.

The photographer was granted permission at one of the academies and spent a few days with the monks as they went about their daily routine, which included practicing acrobatics on repeat.\u00a0Some of the boys ate with McCurry at a noodle joint across the street, sharing their hopes to eventually land jobs in security services, performance troupes, as well as the entertainment industry.\u00a0\u201cThey were normal kids,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they were very, very dedicated and serious about this practice.\u201d He captured other photographs of monks\u2019 intense training regimes during his stay, including several hanging upside down by their feet, hands calmly pressed into a prayer pose.

{"id": "style_alopecia-in-art-history-wellness", "text": "At least 40% of women experience\u00a0hair loss or alopecia over their lifetimes. This could be alopecia areata (patchy hair loss), traction alopecia (strained hair loss) or another form. The different ways that women\u2019s hair loss has been depicted across art history demonstrates the many different ways it has been interpreted over the years. In 16th and 17th century Britain, for example, women\u2019s alopecia was sometimes interpreted as\u00a0retribution for sins, including adultery. Some historical art, however, depicts a more neutral, or even positive, attitude towards women\u2019s alopecia. In religious or mythical art, it was sometimes idealized as divine. \u201cMadonna and Child\u201d (pictured top), painted in the 15th century by Italian Renaissance artist Carlo Crivelli, shows Jesus and Mary embracing in a gold, stylized setting. The pair sit behind a religious altar surrounded by ripe fruit and adorned with halos. Madonna has a high forehead and her blonde hair recedes, particularly on her right temple. This association between alopecia and divinity is echoed in a work by another Renaissance Italian artist, Cosm\u00e8 Tura. His\u00a0\u201dMadonna and Mary Magdalene\u201d\u00a0(circa 1490) depicts both mother and child with prominent foreheads. A glazed terracotta piece created by the Italian sculptor Andrea della Robbia in 1475 features Prudence, a human embodiment of Christian morality, as a balding two-headed person. Baldness in women has been connected to the divine for various reasons. It took the emphasis off of personal appearance in favour of deeper, more spiritual, priorities. But intentional hair removal played a role too. For some religious people, such as Buddhist nuns and Haredi Jewish wives, a bald head is thought to be\u00a0purer\u00a0and shaving can represent a\u00a0regular, sacrificial ritual. Ancient depictions Artwork on the walls of the tomb of the ancient Egyptian pharaoh, Akhenaten who ruled from 1351 to 1334 B.C., depicts two of his daughters, naked, with bald heads. Head shaving as well as natural baldness was common among the ancient Egyptians, including women. In fact, ancient Egyptians had\u00a0distinct terms\u00a0for female and male alopecia. This attests to just how common baldness, head shaving and wig wearing were for both sexes in ancient Egypt. And it isn\u2019t just Egypt. Partial and full head shaving has historically been common among women across sub-Saharan Africa. As\u00a0one traveller observed\u00a0among the inhabitants of the 18th century Kingdom of Issini (modern-day Ghana): \u201cSome only shave one half of the head \u2026 Others leave broad patches here and there unshaved.\u201d Medieval and Renaissance alopecia The 15th century painting, \u201cPortrait of a Woman with a Man at a Casement,\u201d by the Italian artist, Fra Filippo Lippi, features an aristocratic profile of a woman facing a man. She has a prominent forehead and high hairline. The appearance of recessed frontal hairlines in Medieval and Renaissance Europe\u00a0may have been fashionable\u00a0and even considered a sign of intelligence, encouraging customs of forehead shaving and eyebrow plucking. The 16th century queen of England, Elizabeth I, was often painted in this way.\u00a0One undated oil portrait\u00a0of the British monarch depicts her in bejeweled robes, with a pearl emblazoned veil and a prominent forehead. The removal of female bodily hair at this time, including on the forehead, wasn\u2019t just a matter of fashion. It also arguably arose due to patriarchal ideas that women\u2019s body hair was\u00a0dirty and even dangerous to men. Modern alopecia Adverts\u00a0and\u00a0research\u00a0today tend to discuss hair loss exclusively through medical terms, as a kind of detrimental disease. A recent\u00a0BBC article\u00a0refers to people with alopecia areata as \u201cpatients\u201d and their experience of it as \u201cprofoundly challenging\u201d. This certainly reflects some experiences, but not those who interpret their hair loss more neutrally, or even with\u00a0pride. Pharmaceutical and cosmetic products are promoted as \u201cnecessary\u201d treatments. A newly licensed drug, litfulo or ritlecitinib, was\u00a0hailed\u00a0last month as the \u201cfirst treatment\u201d and \u201cmedicine\u201d for alopecia. But as many forms of alopecia are not delimiting and as the \u201ctreatments\u201d on offer have limited efficacy and potential safety issues, this should\u00a0not be the default response. For example, the\u00a0European Medicine Agency\u00a0notes that ritlecitinib results in 80% hair regrowth but only for 36% of people taking it. About 10% are at risk of diarrhea, acne and throat infections. Another study\u00a0noted that\u00a0similar alopecia drugs, that operate through immunosuppression, only seem to work if they are taken continuously, yet their long-term safety has not been established. Depictions of alopecia throughout art history are a reminder of the many complicated ways women\u2019s hair loss has been viewed. Sometimes weaponized as a way to shame women, sometimes venerated as a sign of the divine, the truth is that hair loss really indicates nothing about a woman\u2019s worth, morality or status. But historical depictions of women\u2019s alopecia and baldness provide hope. They show that alopecia has been conceptualized differently at different times. This means the current framing of alopecia as an inevitably disadvantaging disease in need of certain \u201ctreatments\u201d might be biased too. They suggest if our societal interpretation of alopecia improves (as something that shouldn\u2019t be stigmatized), then so too may the individual experience (as something that shouldn\u2019t be dreaded).", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/alopecia-in-art-history-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_04_29_style_dodecahedron-roman-object-mystery-scn-scli-intl", "text": "Amateur archaeologists in England have unearthed one of the largest Roman dodecahedrons ever found, but mystery surrounds what it was actually used for. The 12-sided object is one of just 33 known to exist in Roman Britain, and one of approximately 130 in the world. It is considered \u201cone of archaeology\u2019s great enigmas,\u201d according to the Norton Disney History and Archaeology Group, an amateur group based in the English region of Lincolnshire where it was found in June. Measuring about 8 centimeters (3 inches) across, the dodecahedron is hollow and covered with 12 holes of varying sizes. The 1,700-year-old object will be displayed at the Lincoln Museum from May 4 until early September. \u201cIt\u2019s a real pleasure to have the Norton Disney dodecahedron joining us\u2026 just a stone\u2019s throw from where it was found,\u201d Andrea Martin, exhibitions and interpretations manager at the museum, said in a Lincolnshire County Council press release. \u201cTo have the opening of the display coincide with the Lincoln Festival of History is a real coup.\u201d The release describes the dodecahedron as \u201cone of the largest examples\u201d discovered. However, experts still aren\u2019t sure exactly what the Romans used the dodecahedron for. \u201cIt is completely unique,\u201d said Richard Parker, secretary of the Norton Disney History and Archaeology Group, adding that no similar objects have ever been found. He said that, unlike other dodecahedra, this one is undamaged. \u201cOurs is absolutely in a fabulous condition. It\u2019s complete, undamaged, and it clearly was considered of great value by whoever made it and by those that used it,\u201d Parker said. \u201cSo there must have been a very important reason for it to be deposited in the ground in the way that it was.\u201d Parker told CNN there are no descriptions of the dodecahedron in Roman literature, and they have not been depicted pictorially in mosaics. There are also several features that make it difficult to discern what its intended purpose was. All of the dodecahedra are of different sizes, meaning they were not used for measurement, he said. Because it is undamaged with no signs of wear, it is unlikely to have been a tool, Parker added. Parker\u2019s group does have one working theory, however. \u201cMost likely they were some form of religious or ritual object,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Romans were a very superstitious lot, and generally required signs to allow them to make decisions in their daily lives.\u201d One indication supporting that idea is that the object was found near a small Roman mounted rider god figurine with \u201cstrong religious connections,\u201d Parker said. The artifact was discovered in 1989 by metal detectorists, and the figurine is \u201coften found on temple sites.\u201d The organization plans to return to the dig site later this year to conduct further excavations, which Parker hopes will help establish context on how the area was used. Parker said he is optimistic that the mystery will be solved because this dodecahedron was found in an archaeological excavation area, whereas \u201cmany of those that were found 200 or 300 years ago had no context to where they were found.\u201d \u201cIt is quite a complex story to tell that we\u2019re just starting to tease out,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/29/style/dodecahedron-roman-object-mystery-scn-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_style_lagos-fashion-lgbtq-inclusivity", "text": "Since its inception in 2011,\u00a0Lagos\u00a0Fashion Week has been a twice-yearly highlight of the African fashion calendar, a multi-day\u00a0showcase attracting the continent\u2019s top design\u00a0houses, big name sponsors, as well as an international audience. In a deeply religious and conservative Nigeria,\u00a0where\u00a0LGBTQ\u00a0people suffer extremely high\u00a0levels of homophobia, intolerance, and even violence,\u00a0Lagos\u00a0Fashion Week quickly established itself as an inclusive space for marginalized communities and unconventional brands to be seen and heard. For more than a decade, Nigerian label Orange Culture has staged catwalk shows featuring male models in skirts, makeup, or wearing ribbons down the runway as a way of provoking conversations about how fashion can be used to break down gender norms. Maxivive \u2014\u00a0which\u00a0describes\u00a0itself\u00a0as \u201ca\u00a0Lagos-based fashion organization founded\u2026 on ideas of nonconformity and the subversion of norms\u201d \u2014\u00a0has\u00a0also made waves showcasing graphic, gender-bending pieces addressing issues around sexuality and identity over consecutive seasons. Over the past few years however, members of the\u00a0LGBTQ community\u00a0in Nigeria say\u00a0Lagos\u00a0Fashion Week\u2019s inclusive stance has come under pressure amidst a growing culture of hostility towards non-binary and gay people in the country. In 2014, despite widespread international condemnation, Nigeria \u2014 Africa\u2019s most populous nation \u2014\u00a0adopted the SSMPA law (Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act)\u00a0which bans gay marriage, same-sex relationships and membership of gay rights groups with punishments including a prison term of up to 14 years for those convicted. Gay\u00a0rights\u00a0activists say these sentiments are filtering down into what was one of Nigeria\u2019s most open-minded industries: Fashion. Kayode Timileyin is the founder of Queercity Media and Production, one of the leading non- governmental\u00a0queer organizations in Nigeria as well as being the festival manager for\u00a0Lagos\u00a0Pride, a week-long celebration in June to commemorate Pride month in Nigeria. \u201cThere is a history of anti-queerness when it comes to fashion week in Nigeria,\u201d he told CNN. Activists point to the city\u2019s Spring-Summer 2022 showcase, featuring the late Fola Francis \u2014 the first-ever transgender person\u00a0to be cast by labels to model on the city\u2019s catwalk.\u00a0 Francis tragically drowned in December 2023. While her debut was hailed as a watershed moment in both African fashion and for the queer community at large (she walked twice, for labels Cute-Saint and Fruch\u00e9), it also sparked controversy. At the time, Francis said she faced a public backlash from some sections of Nigerian society\u00a0and pointed out that despite her boundary-breaking appearances, no images of her were posted on\u00a0Lagos\u00a0Fashion Week\u2019s social media accounts.\u00a0In\u00a0an interview with digital LGBTQ magazine Xtra\u00a0shortly after the event in November 2022, Francis said \u201cI heard the\u00a0Lagos Fashion Week\u2019s team decided not to post any of my pictures from the runway or include (them) in any press releases. Why am I not surprised?\u201d (The magazine said they approached\u00a0Lagos\u00a0Fashion Week at the time, who did not respond to their requests for comment.) After casting non-binary models to walk on its catwalk during the Spring-Summer 2023 shows, subversive fashion house Maxivive had its show cancelled by organizers just days before it was meant to go ahead. While brand founder Papa Oyeyemi told CNN he would prefer not to talk about the cancellation, discussion within the industry centered around the presentation having been deemed \u201ctoo gay\u201d by organizers. \u201cFor the presentation to get cancelled at the last minute was very disheartening,\u201d one non-binary model booked to walk for Maxivive told CNN (they wished to remain anonymous for their safety). \u201cQueer people exist in Nigeria and fashion is meant to be expressive, not restrictive.\u201d Tosin Ogundadegbe, a Lagos-based fashion stylist\u00a0known as \u201cThe Style Infidel\u201d on social\u00a0media said that the fashion industry in Nigeria still has a long way to go when it comes to\u00a0inclusivity. \u201cThe traditional fashion schedule suffers from (a lack of) inclusivity on the runway \u2014 we only see representation of marginalized communities at private shows.\u201d Finding the freedom to be who you are Indeed, amid what\u2019s perceived as a growing pressure for organizers to adhere to anti-gay laws and increasingly divisive politics around gender, sexuality and inclusivity in Nigeria, an increasing number of fashion labels have chosen to show \u201coff-schedule\u201d via \u201cunderground\u201d private presentations where they feel they can be more free to embody the ethos of their brands, rather than in the glare of\u00a0Lagos\u00a0Fashion Week. From labels such as\u00a0Tzar Studios,\u00a0a \u201cvisually provocative contemporary menswear brand\u2026 inspired by the ethos of the metrosexual man,\u201d to\u00a0ready-to-wear brand\u00a0Weiz Dhurm Franklyn, these\u00a0clandestine, \u201cinvite only\u201d shows are curated by designers who keep locations discreet and hand-pick trusted journalists, influencers, celebrities and fashion industry figures to sit in the audience. Udiahgebi, a fashion brand known for its androgynous pieces, has successfully hosted private shows in this way. The house\u00a0cast five non-binary models to walk in its first-ever runway show in 2022 to a positive reception, brand creative director Chiemerie Udiahgebi Ugwoke told CNN. \u201cThe feedback after my show was\u00a0alarmingly good,\u201d they wrote over email. \u201cI was not expecting positive reviews from the attendees because\u2026 I took gender-neutral clothes (featuring see-through fabrics, animal prints and cut-outs) and played with them in a way I felt was more likely to attract negative reviews\u00a0considering the society we live in.\u201d \u201cI see fashion as art, it is meant to start a conversation and also provoke thought,\u201d said Kayode Timileyin. \u201cHowever, over the years, (Lagos) Fashion Week continues to hush down and limit these conversations.\u201d While championing an inclusive future for the artists and fashion designers of Africa cannot solely be done behind closed doors; for now, many designers believe it is the only \u2014 and an essential \u2014 way to be able to freely express who they are.

{"id": "2024_04_19_style_wash-day-photos-black-hair-tomesha-faxio", "text": "\u201cI was having wash day with my kids, and I was looking at their hair,\u201d the photographer Tomesha Faxio, a mother of two daughters, explained to CNN in a video call of her new monograph. \u201cI was just sitting in that moment, and it just dawned on me. Like, oh, wait a minute \u2014 this is it. I knew I wanted to showcase our hair in its natural state. I wanted to show the inherent beauty of Black natural hair.\u201d For Black women and children, wash day is equal parts essential maintenance and self-renewal. In my natural-haired family, our weekly or bi-weekly wash day starts with the gathering of the first set of tools; a wide-toothed comb, two body towels \u2014 one that can stand to get wet during the wash, another to wrap hair in afterwards \u2014 as well as shampoo, conditioner and deep conditioner. Once the two washes and conditionings have been completed in the kitchen sink, we head to the playroom, where we finger detangle with a product. Depending on if they\u2019re getting braids or not, my husband or I will blow dry our child\u2019s hair on low heat or let it air dry. (We don\u2019t typically do both of our kids\u2019 hair on the same day.) The process takes maybe three hours, but as a whole hinges on the styling that comes after the wash. This can also take hours, making it feel like every bit of a day. In the series of portraits that make up \u201cWash Day,\u201d Faxio sat with 26 families and took photos as they went through their distinct routines. Though each family had their own methods \u2014 and hair stories, which are shared in texts accompanying Faxio\u2019s photos \u2014 the cyclical nature of washings and styling has made the\u00a0day something that is universally understood, and appreciated, across Black communities. In her approach, Faxio took a pointed interest in hair as it was, versus how it was to become. \u201cI think that there\u2019s been beautiful work done on our hair portraiture and work that\u2019s been done with the hair styled in all these beautiful, intricate ways,\u201d she explained. \u201cBut I hadn\u2019t, at that time, seen a ton of work where the hair was just as is, and that\u2019s what I wanted to capture.\u201d The natural hair movement, with its first wave coming during the Black Is Beautiful era of the 1970s and the second during the digital revolution, has done their part in easing tensions around kinky, unprocessed hair, but old habits die hard. We talk often, after all, about the obsession with hair being \u201cdone\u201d and the intra-communal shame that sometimes comes with natural hair. Even as the Crown Act, a bill meant to stop hair-based discrimination, reverberates country-wide, the predisposition with how Black hair will be perceived \u2018on the job\u2019 \u2014 shorthand for by White observers \u2014 has fed into racist viewpoints and judgments on the acceptability of certain hairstyles. Faxio is hoping her book can further help foster conversations and encourage people to love their hair as it is. \u201cSo many of us have learned to accept ourselves more fully, and, in turn, are able to teach our children to do the same. We are now more informed about why we grew up thinking our hair was ugly\u2026 we can see that that these views are steeped in racism,\u201d she writes in the introduction to \u201cWash Day.\u201d \u201cWhile our children will likely continue to contend with non-inclusive beauty standards, we are putting them in a better position to understand and eradicate them.\u201d Speaking with Faxio, and engaging with her photobook, reminds me of my own childhood wash days. I had a head full of black, thick hair. Keeping me calm during washings was a task; I was afraid of water and recoiled at the idea of each session, let alone the actual practice. One weekend \u2014 my wash days were always on weekends \u2014 my mother needed support. She trotted upstairs to a cousin\u2019s apartment, hoping the elders there would help soothe my fears and step in so she wouldn\u2019t have to do it alone. (She was tired of doing things alone.) There, Mom walked me to the sink, turned the warm water on and started lathering. My aunt and grandmother took turns. I nearly soaked a towel while trying to keep the water from touching my face, but through the fear, I felt cared for. \u201cCalm down. Brooklyn, what if you turn around so your head is facing upward? Right, like that.\u201d  Twenty-five years later, I have a daughter of my own. For us too,\u00a0wash day is a high energy sport \u2014 and it\u2019s also a bonding exercise that neither of us will forget. Therein lies the beauty of the experience. \u201cI learned so much from these moms,\u201d Faxio said. \u201cThe greatest thing for me is a renewed love for wash day and renewed sense of value in the process.\u201d Before she set out to write \u201cWash Day,\u201d she\u2019d try to push back her daughters\u2019 washes because she knew that when it was all said and done, her arms would be sore and she\u2019d want to just melt in bed. Now, though, she welcomes the experience. \u201cIt\u2019s work. But spending time with these moms and thinking about how we are able to pass on love of our hair \u2014 an inheritance of pride and joy in our hair, to our kids,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt just renewed my love for the process.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/19/style/wash-day-photos-black-hair-tomesha-faxio/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_style_new-miss-usa-crowned-hawaii-savannah-gankiewicz", "text": "Amid a dramatic two weeks of resignations and allegations made against the Miss USA organization, Miss Hawaii USA Savannah Gankiewicz \u2014 who had originally placed as the first runner-up at the 2023 Miss USA pageant \u2014 has stepped up to be crowned Miss USA. \u201cWhile this decision was not made lightly, I firmly believe that this opportunity was meant for me and I am ready to make a positive impact with this organization that I hold dear to my heart,\u201d said the 28-year-old, who was crowned by the governor of Hawaii Josh Green at a ceremony in Honolulu, Hawaii, on Wednesday. \u201cI am dedicated to taking action and making a difference. With my background as a certified mental health first aid responder and training in anti-bullying suicide prevention. I understand, the importance of prioritizing your well-being and advocating for those in need. I believe that the true change starts from within and I am determined to lead by example and empower the class of 2024 and beyond,\u201d she said, addressing a crowd in a hotel in Waikiki, a small aquarium in the background. Gankiewicz has taken over the title from Noelia Voigt, who suddenly gave up her crown earlier this month. Voigt cited her mental health as her reason for stepping down, but her resignation letter to the Miss Universe organization,\u00a0obtained\u00a0by CNN, accused CEO Laylah Rose, of \u201cactively building a culture of fear and control.\u201d Among her claims, she wrote that Miss USA management often failed to provide her with travel accommodations or an \u201ceffective handler,\u201d the latter leading to an instance where Voigt says she was sexually harassed during a Christmas parade in Sarasota, Florida, while alone with an unnamed person in a car. The Miss Universe organization and Rose, through Miss USA, did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Two days after Voigt\u2019s resignation, Miss Teen USA 2023 UmaSofia Srivastava relinquished her title as well, writing on Instagram that her values \u201cno longer fully align with the direction of the organization.\u201d In her first official appearance since the controversy, Rose did not address any of the allegations. She welcomed Gankiewicz to the Miss USA family telling her to \u201cembrace this moment of influence and let your words carry the power of positive change,\u201d and thanked her corporate partners and sponsors for their \u201cunwavering support.\u201d Rose said that this year\u2019s Miss Teen USA and Miss USA pageants would take place in Los Angeles and would broadcast on the CW network. The CW announced a multi-year agreement to air the two pageants in April, but in light of recent allegations, USA Today reported Monday that the network was \u201cevaluating\u201d its relationship with the Miss USA organization. The CW did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Tumult and turnover Currently, the Miss Teen USA role remains unfilled. The first runner-up from 2023, New York\u2019s Stephanie Skinner, declined to be crowned in a public statement on Instagram. On Tuesday, Voigt and Srivastava\u2019s mothers spoke out on \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d saying their daughters remained under strict non-disclosure agreements in their contracts and could not talk about their experiences. \u201cThe job of their dreams turned out to be a nightmare,\u201d Barbara Srivastava said. \u201cThe girls decided to step down and give (up) their dream of a lifetime \u2014 a crown, a national title. Why would two girls decide to give that up?\u201d During their reigning year, she added, their daughters were \u201cill-treated, abused, bullied and cornered,\u201d she added. Miss USA and Miss Universe Organization have not returned CNN\u2019s multiple requests for comment. Though many current Miss USA state titleholders expressed their public support on Instagram following Voigt\u2019s resignation, this week, the reigning Miss Colorado USA, Arianna Lemus, gave up her title completely. \u201cMy values were compromised.

Voigt\u2019s mother, Jackeline Voigt, said on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d that contestants should reconsider competing at all. \u201cLook at what happened to Noelia and UmaSofia,\u201d she said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s not the right time to participate.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/style/new-miss-usa-crowned-hawaii-savannah-gankiewicz/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_style_catherine-princess-wales-tatler-scli-intl", "text": "A new portrait of Catherine, Princess of Wales has stoked controversy online, with some royal fans criticizing the work for its portrayal of the future British Queen. The painting, by British-Zambian artist Hannah Uzor, features on the cover of the July issue of Tatler magazine. It aims to honor the \u201cstrength and dignity\u201d of the princess, according to a statement from the publication sent to CNN Thursday. It depicts Catherine during her appearance at the first state banquet of King Charles III\u2019s reign, and Uzor said she studied photographs of the princess in the process of creating the work. \u201cWhen you can\u2019t meet the sitter in person, you have to look at everything you can find and piece together the subtle human moments revealed in different photographs: do they have a particular way of standing or holding their head or hands? Do they have a recurrent gesture?,\u201d she said in the statement. Uzor also revealed that Kate\u2019s recent video announcing a cancer diagnosis informed the work. \u201cAll my portraits are made up of layers of a personality, constructed from everything I can find about them,\u201d she said in the statement. However, not everybody appreciated the portrayal of the princess. \u201cThis is dreadful - somehow, I\u2019m not sure the artist is a fan of the Princess - it looks like a bad GCSE project,\u201d reads one comment under a post from Tatler on X. \u201cThis looks nothing like the Princess of Wales. It\u2019s so awful, it\u2019s disrespectful,\u201d reads another. \u201cI agree with the sentiments of strength and dignity but the portrait lacks any resemblance to the Princess of Wales,\u201d said another. However, some did praise the work, with one calling the painting \u201cbeautiful.\u201d \u201cAm I the only person who likes this? It\u2019s art, not a photo,\u201d wrote another commenter. And it wasn\u2019t just social media users who reacted to the painting. Alastair Sooke, chief art critic at UK newspaper The Daily Telegraph, said in an article that the painting was \u201cintolerably bad\u201d and \u201cshows no flicker of resemblance to its subject.\u201d \u201cHas there been a flatter, more lifeless royal portrait in living memory?\u201d Sooke wrote. \u201cBeneath a Lego-like helmet of unmodulated, monotonously brown \u2018hair,\u2019 this Princess of Wales has as much charisma as a naff figurine atop a wedding cake.\u201d Kate Mansey, royal editor at The Times of London, was also non-plus. \u201cI\u2019m not quite sure what to say about this one, except, hmm\u2026\u201d she wrote on X. The backlash follows a similar discussion surrounding the first official portrait of King Charles III since his coronation, which was revealed earlier this month. The 8.5 by 6.5-foot painting by British artist Jonathan Yeo depicts the monarch wearing the uniform of the Welsh Guards, sword in hand, against a fiery red background that appears to almost swallow him whole, as a butterfly looks like it\u2019s about to land on his shoulder. While the King is reportedly happy with the portrait, others criticized the lurid red brushstrokes, with one person likening it to a \u201cposter for a horror film.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/style/catherine-princess-wales-tatler-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}

{"id": "2024_06_17_style_wheatfield-ny-montana-agnes-denes", "text": "Four decades after the artist Agnes Denes planted and harvested a two-acre wheat field in Lower Manhattan, using one of the last undeveloped plots of land in the economic capital to create an idyllic but ephemeral vista, the ecological artist \u2014 now aged 93 \u2014 has reimagined the project in Montana. \u201cWheatfield \u2013 An Inspiration\u201d marks the first time the Budapest-born, New York-based artist has planted a wheat field in the US since she spent that muggy summer in 1982 with a group of volunteers cleaning up a landfill in Battery Park City to make it tenable for rows of the golden crop to grow. It drew crowds and reporters \u2014 including CNN \u2014 and made for a striking view as the wheat flourished against the backdrop of the Twin Towers. Made as an act of rebellion, the beauty of the field was a call to reprioritize human values and incite change among world powers decades before the environmental crisis became a mainstream concern. (It has been restaged internationally, including in Milan in 2015, and at Art Basel in Switzerland this month, concurrently with the field in Montana.) Out west, Denes hopes to plant seeds of community with the help of the project\u2019s host,\u00a0Tinworks, an arts organization in the rapidly developing city of Bozeman. Wheat may not be out of place in Montana, a top-producing state of the crop in the country\u2019s agricultural heartland, but it is a reminder of the changing landscape as urban centers continue to sprawl outwards and food insecurity looms due to climate change. \u201cWheat is wonderful \u2014 it sustains humanity and is probably the most planted food next to rice. It\u2019s a good metaphor,\u201d Denes said in a video call with CNN. \u201cThe original \u2018Wheatfield\u2019 was a confrontation of people who run the world. I wanted leaders to rethink the use of land and the use of humanity,\u201d she added. \u201cThis \u2018Wheatfield\u2019 is a totally different idea \u2014 to bring people together.\u201d Denes and Tinworks are doing so in collaboration with Bozeman residents, students and small businesses. Last fall, around 50 volunteers cleaned up the site, a lot owned by Tinworks, and planted the winter wheat led by a local fifth-generation farmer, Kenny Van Dyke. They will tend the wheat by hand all summer until September, when students from Montana State University\u2019s plant sciences department, which is also a partner on the project, will harvest the crop. Wheat will also be sprouting all around the city in solidarity with the project, thanks to some 200 packets of seeds Tinworks distributed to community members. Come fall, local bakeries will use the resulting flour milled from the grain in their products, and will help keep regional food banks stocked, according to Tinworks director Jenny Moore.  \u201c(\u2018Wheatfield\u2019) is so timely, in terms of the issues that we\u2019re facing with climate change, agricultural developments, food sustainability, food insecurity, the value of land and the loss of agricultural land in Bozeman,\u201d Moore said in a call. \u201cUnderstanding the presence and role of wheat in Montana both historically and presently, it just seemed like such a fantastic opportunity to ask Agnes if she would reconsider the work in (this) context.\u201d Though the wheat has successfully sprouted, unseasonably warm weather in December and January meant only scant snow for the winter crop, whose survival typically relies on several inches of coverage. At the time of the call with Moore in February, the field\u2019s future seemed precarious. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019d wished the weather wasn\u2019t so much proving the point of what a crisis point we\u2019re in,\u201d she said. Through land and time Over her career, Denes has been a pioneering figure in ecological art, with concepts that strive to \u201cunite the human intellect with the majesty of nature,\u201d as she described in her collection of writings, \u201cThe Human Argument.\u201d Her work is a call to action and, often, a warning, but always in service of demonstrating how art can help improve humanity. The scale of her projects is often grand and complex. Take \u201cTree Mountain,\u201d which involved planting 11,000 trees in a spiral formation in a gravel pit near Ylojarvi, Finland, in the 1990s. Embodying her fascination with mathematics in nature, structure and beauty, the form is based on the spiral of sunflower seeds, which follow the golden ratio. Each tree belongs to the person who planted it, an assertion of our shared responsibility over the stewardship of Earth \u201cThey own it. The only thing is, they can\u2019t sell it \u2014 no money is ever involved, but they can leave it to their children and their children\u2019s children in perpetuity,\u201d Denes explained. \u201cSo it becomes a family. The forest becomes a family connected by a tree.\u201d Many of her ideas are in this vein, with projects meant to establish conversations not only globally, but through vast stretches of time. \u201cI\u2019m the most impractical person you ever want to meet,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it never comes into question of how difficult it\u2019s going to be\u2026 I know it\u2019s practical, because it\u2019s made for humanity.\u201d But though Denes has been extraordinarily prolific in her concepts and proposals \u2014 many of her some 200 ideas have been published in \u201cThe Human Argument\u201d \u2014 she has only realized a fraction of them in her lifetime. The majority only be experienced through writings, schematics and models. They include her plan to bury time capsules containing information about our current civilization in Antarctica\u2019s glaciers, to be carried out by the ocean in thousands of years\u2019 time, or an early idea to create a silent, flying aircraft to understand the movements and behaviors of migrating birds. \u201cPeople know me finally \u2014 (but) after working 60 years or 70 years, they know me on three or four projects. That\u2019s it,\u201d she said. \u201cCan you imagine if I could have realized 20 or 30?\u201d Sowing seeds for change As with \u201cWheatfield,\u201d seeds have often served as potent symbols for Denes. Her first noted work was a small, private performance in Sullivan County, New York, in 1968, which involved Denes planting rice seeds to signify life, chaining a series of trees together to represent decay, and burying a haiku to illustrate higher thinking \u2014 three concepts which exist in a triangularity, she asserted. Nine years later, she was invited to restage the performance at Artpark in Lewiston, where she planted a half-acre of rice on Niagara Gorge above the falls. More recently, she exhibited the verdant \u201cLiving Pyramid\u201d in Long Island, New York, in 2015; in Kassel, Germany, in 2017 for the international art show Documenta; and in Istanbul in 2022. Comprising rows of greenery that sloped upward into a vertiginous pyramid, the plants sprouted over the course of the exhibitions and were eventually given away to visitors. The artist has often returned to pyramids in her work as another vehicle for her ideas; a 17-foot model for her study of towering, luminescent \u201cCrystal Pyramid,\u201d meant to be a counterpart to Egypt\u2019s stone-made wonders of the world, was shown at her retrospective at The Shed in New York from 2019-2020. With \u201cWheatfield \u2013 An Inspiration,\u201d like with all her work, Denes strives for nuance and to engender change through visitors and participants who take something meaningful from the work. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of political art going on \u2014 useless, aggravating. I want to change people in the most subtle way possible,\u201d she explained. \u201cLet people sensitize themselves and believe in themselves \u2014 and that\u2019s political. But\u2026 it\u2019s not making people into enemies, or looking down on different people.\u201d Denes has left her mark in significant ways around the world, in messages buried deep in the earth and in the formations of forests architected as monuments to a more hopeful future. She is continuing the work even now, well into her nineties, looking for more of her projects to be approved\u00a0\u2014 including a 117-acre forest in a landfill in Queens, New York, that she hopes she can\u00a0bring to life,\u00a0rather than lose the site to building developers. All, she hopes, will outlive her in some way, through their physicality or ideology. \u201cI\u2019m planting ideas in the mind, as well as wheat,\u201d she said of \u201cWheatfield.\u201d \u201cMining into minds takes a long time,\u201d she added with a small laugh. \u201cI\u2019m a mind-miner.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/style/wheatfield-ny-montana-agnes-denes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "style_brutalist-plant-photos-c2e-spc", "text": "Austere. Stark. Cold. The common opinions about Brutalist architecture are a far cry from the way we often describe the natural world: lush, colorful, verdant. But a new photobook is exploring nature\u2019s relationship with Brutalist architecture \u2014 from a theater in Japan to a library in Canada \u2014 and finding beauty in the contrast. Called \u201cBrutalist Plants,\u201d the book is a \u201cmix of looking into the future but also looking back,\u201d said Olivia Broome, curator of the book and creator of the @brutalistplants Instagram community of more than 30,000 followers. Broome hopes the images will inspire people to look at the built environment differently \u2014 and see it as a place that can complement nature. \u201cEither we all exist in harmony with nature and concrete, or we all mess it up so badly that nature is going to overtake everything that we build,\u201d she said. Dystopia or utopia? Brutalism, sometimes referred to as \u201cNew Brutalism,\u201d is an architectural style typified by its imposing form, use of geometric shapes and clean lines, exposed concrete, and monochromatic color schemes. Its popularity peaked between the 1950s and \u201870s and it\u2019s commonly associated with the UK and Eastern Europe, but this international style has its roots in much earlier 20th-century structures from around the world, particularly those of Swiss architect Le Corbusier, whose work prioritized functionality and large, sculptural shapes. Born in the UK, Broome grew up in Geneva, Switzerland, which first sparked her interest in Brutalism. \u201cWhere I grew up, there were a lot of mountains and concrete,\u201d she said, adding that in Geneva there were a lot of buildings by Le Corbusier: \u201cLooking back, (Brutalist buildings) feel like a homely space for me.\u201d The \u201cBrutalist Plants\u201d platform started as a hobby: Broome shared images on Tumblr before she moved it to Instagram in 2018. The account reposts the work of photographers, with tags and credits, and as the community has grown into the tens of thousands, many photographers and content creators now submit work to her. Broome was attracted to the images because of the contrast of the cold concrete with the softness of nature, which has an ambiguous \u201cdystopian or utopian feel.\u201d \u201cA lot of them are quite modernist, which is a bit more like a utopia,\u201d said Broome. Some of the photos imagine \u201chow we could be living, with plants or balconies,\u201d and the inclusion of architectural renders and AI-generated scenes show hopeful visions of our stark urban world co-existing peacefully alongside nature. On the flip side, some of them have a darker feeling. \u201cThere are a few images in there where it\u2019s genuinely overgrown architectural spaces that no longer exist,\u201d she said, adding that many were submitted by urban explorers of abandoned buildings. People are notably absent from the photos; most of the images are only of architecture and nature, but in a few instances, Broome said humans have been removed from the images to focus the narrative on the built environment\u2019s relationship with nature, which Broome feels is muddled by human presence. \u201cNobody lives in the book, really. There are no human beings. It\u2019s just plants doing their thing,\u201d she added. Controversial structures Featuring 150 photos of buildings, artworks and sculptures, the book includes a mix of images shared on the Instagram account and unseen photos sourced elsewhere, said Broome. With 41 countries featured in the book, Broome is excited to show the huge spread and variety of Brutalist works, and the architectural style\u2019s influence on more recent structures and artworks. One of the \u201cmost contested images\u201d Broome shared with her audience on Instagram, which has also made the cut for the book, is of a sculpture by German artist Karsten Fo\u0308dinger. \u201cIt\u2019s this slab of concrete that sits slightly slanted, held up by pine trees in a row. It kind of looks like a table of concrete that\u2019s attached to these trees,\u201d explained Broome. Online, some people commented it was \u201cawful for the trees\u201d and an affront to nature, while others felt the unity of concrete and wood \u2014\u00a0commonly used in house building \u2014 reflected ideas of shelter and put an artistic twist on it. \u201cThere was a lot of debate back and forth,\u201d said Broome. A lot of the images hold special meaning for Broome: a photograph of a building in Geneva is \u201ctwo minute\u2019s walk\u201d from where her father lives, and some of the buildings photographed in Melbourne and Canberra in Australia are places she\u2019s visited with family and friends. Broome, who moved back to London to study design and journalism at university, now lives in the UK where there are many Brutalist buildings to provide inspiration \u2014\u00a0including the Barbican Theatre, where the book will be launched. She believes Brutalist structures should be preserved for the future \u2014 and the integration of nature shows their adaptability. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of Brutalist (architecture) that is endangered because people don\u2019t see the value,\u201d she said. \u201c(But) there are more architects, and some feature in the book, that are working to make brutalism more accessible and more beautiful, and really showcase what it can do for different spaces.\u201d Brutalist Plants, published by Hoxton Mini Press, is out on May 16, 2024", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/brutalist-plant-photos-c2e-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}

These images, part of the Art Gallery of Ontario\u2019s (AGO) permanent collection, are brought together in a new publication, \u201cCasa Susanna: The Story of the First Trans Network in the United States, 1959-1968,\u201d and offer valuable insight into the environment that Valenti and her wife Marie Tonell created. Purchased in 2004 at a New York City flea market by two art dealers and later acquired by the AGO in 2015, this particular selection of 340 Casa Susanna images are part of a much wider archive, including some currently in the personal collection of photographer Cindy Sherman. In recent years, the photographs have come to the attention of artists, scholars, activists and more interested in the intersections between queer identities, photography and the arts\u2014and more collections of photographs made by members of the community who visited Casa Susanna have been found and archived, such as the Louise Lawrence Transgender Archive. In the last decade, Casa Susanna has inspired a Broadway play, Harvey Fierstein\u2019s \u201cCasa Valentina\u201d; been referenced in the television series \u201cTransparent\u201d; and was the subject of an acclaimed documentary film released last year. The photobook includes contextual essays and a foreword by historian, writer and documentary filmmaker Susan Stryker, who recalls images circulating within her generation and community of trans women in the late 1980s and 1990s. \u201cThey were just ubiquitous in trans underground networks,\u201d Stryker said in an interview with CNN. \u201cI have to say, I\u2019ve been tickled in recent decades when people have discovered them and said, \u2018oh, there\u2019s a treasure trove of these things that we never knew existed.\u2019 It\u2019s like, \u2018who never knew they existed?\u2019\u201d Building community In January 1960, Los Angeles-based writer and editor Virginia Prince launched \u201cTransvestia,\u201d a magazine \u201cpublished by, for and about Transvestites for the purpose of providing a center about which people interested in the field may gather.\u201d This terminology was Prince\u2019s way of describing herself and her intended audience. Although preferred language for many in the trans community has changed since that time, Stryker noted that she is \u201cwary of stamping the past with the present,\u201d and that while different forms of gender expression can be seen in the photographs and some individuals within them may have identified as transgender, others may not have described themselves in that way. \u201cTransvestia\u201d was a subscription-only publication sent clandestinely through the mail until 1963, after which it was available at some newsstands and adult bookstores across America. Though its frequency declined over the years, the magazine remained in circulation until 1986. At the time of its inception, \u201ccross-dressing,\u201d as it was deemed, was criminalized across the US; Prince built up a network of peers by contacting people whose details she found reading arrest reports in newspapers. \u201cVirginia was the person who helped bring that community somewhere out of the deep underground,\u201d said Stryker. Through \u201cTransvestia,\u201d those with similar interests could see themselves reflected in the publication\u2019s pages, and could connect with each other by placing personal advertisements in the person-to-person column. Valenti had a regular column in \u201cTransvestia,\u201d called Susanna Says, and many of the photographs featured in the magazine were taken at Casa Susanna. Born in Chile in 1917, Valenti met her wife at a wig shop \u2014 popular with crossdressers \u2014 that Tonell ran in New York City. Casa Susanna was Tonell\u2019s property in the Catskills; those who frequented the home included Gloria, a millionaire from Michigan; Jessica, a Colombian heiress; and Felicity, an airline pilot and World War II veteran who was the sibling of photographer Lee Miller. \u201cI think it became an almost mythical place, that place we all seek in some way where you feel accepted and where you feel at home,\u201d said Sophie Hackett, the AGO\u2019s Curator of Photography and co-author of the new book. \u201cIt provided, even if only for a weekend, a sense of home and a sense of family for people who perhaps didn\u2019t feel that elsewhere in their lives. We can\u2019t underestimate the power of that, and the pictures are a testament to that.\u201d Finding home In Stryker\u2019s view, Valenti\u2019s role in cultivating the physical space was crucial, and the way she lived her daily life as a femme-presenting person was a model for others. \u201cYou see people who become mothers to their community and that\u2019s really the way I think of Susanna most deeply,\u201d said Stryker. \u201cShe was trans mother to her community and she provided a nurturing and supportive environment for people to get to a better place in their life. I see that as a very positive and giving way of being.\u201d Postwar American values emphasized a \u201csuburban nuclear family existence,\u201d with stereotypically traditional, rigid gender roles, said Hackett. That broader societal backdrop provides important context for the photographs\u2019 production, and the way that gender is explored and expressed by the individuals within them. \u201cSo many of the individuals are seeking to understand what this impulse was, which flew in the face of the way many of them were raised as men in the United States at the time,\u201d Hackett added. It too provides insight into the way the individuals at Casa Susanna both saw and wanted to see themselves. In many ways, this aesthetic echoed Virginia Prince\u2019s preference for the way those featured in \u201cTransvestia\u201d should look. In an October 1961 article, titled \u201cThe Art of Female Impersonation,\u201d Prince wrote a series of guidelines for manners and mannerisms, including ways of sitting, standing and smoking, that she felt emulated \u201cthe best in womanhood.\u201d \u201cWhat I see mostly when I look at those photos are people who are trying their best to embody a middle class respectability of womanhood,\u201d said Stryker. \u201cThey are not being freaky-deaky gender queers or flamboyant drag queens. They are showing they can be a \u2018respectable\u2019 person by showing how they embody very conventional and mostly white, middle class interpretations of what respectable womanhood looks like.\u201d The act of making these images was in itself a way of forming both a sense of self, and connecting with a broader community. In discoveries of other Casa Susanna photographs, multiple copies of the same image have been found. \u201cIt looks like these photos were traded like baseball cards; people in the community swapped them with each other,\u201d said Stryker. \u201cIt was just a really important way of making real a way that people felt about themselves and making it communal rather than subjective or in your head.\u201d Although Valenti expressed plans to turn Casa Susanna into a hotel, and to live full time as a woman, an accident Tonell suffered in 1967 meant that she had to work, and live, as her male identity in order to cover medical bills. Her regular column in \u201cTransvestia\u201d came to an end, the book\u2019s co-author Isabelle Bonnet wrote in an introductory text, and she stopped communicating with Prince.\u00a0 Casa Susanna was sold in 1972. From the early 1980s onwards, Valenti and Tonell lived separately, with Valenti living as a woman. Both died in 1996. In the current climate, with trans rights the subject of legal and political challenges across the country, the existence and celebration of these photographs matter. \u201cThe photographs show us that what we would now refer to as the trans community and all its various identities of course predates our current moment,\u201d said Hackett. \u201cThey are moving as expressions of a community and as a community finds itself. You see the kinship, and you see the joy, and that\u2019s one that\u2019s in strict contrast to the lives they led and the struggles they had personally, and the risks they ran by gathering.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/style/casa-susanna-trans-photo-archive/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_style_fumihiko-maki-architect-dies", "text": "Tokyo (AP) \u2014 Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for designs praised as smartly and artfully fusing the East with the West, has died. He was 95. Maki, who taught architecture and urban design at Harvard, died June 6, his office, Maki & Associates, said Wednesday. Japanese media reports attributed the cause of death to old age. The office declined to confirm the reports. The National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto is considered one of his classic designs, with floating forms of glass, metal and concrete. Its gray exterior appears simple at first glance but sets off patterns of reflected light on rough and polished marble. In the U.S., Maki\u2019s projects included the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and 4 World Trade Center in New York. He also did the Makuhari Messe exhibition hall in Chiba, Japan, and the Hillside Terrace Complex in Tokyo. Maki in the 1980s designed Tokyo\u2019s Spiral building, whose management mourned his death and thanked him for \u201cthe beautiful slopes and the rich space that envisioned an urban park.\u201d In 2013, Maki\u00a0complained about the then planned spaceship-like design\u00a0of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics stadium, slamming it as too expensive and clashing with its surroundings. He said he had the support 100 other people, including architects, in opposing the size of the proposed design by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. \u201cThe problems I see with the planned stadium all relate to the issue of scale,\u201d he said.That design was eventually ditched for a more modest-looking design by\u00a0Kengo Kuma\u00a0which used pieces of wood for a natural Japanese look. Born in Tokyo in 1928, Maki was educated at the University of Tokyo, the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Before opening his own design firm in 1965 in Tokyo, he worked in various offices including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, or SOM, based in Chicago, and Sert, Jackson & Associates in Cambridge, as well as the campus planning office of Washington University in St. Louis. A devoted educator, Maki, in addition to teaching at Washington University, Harvard and the University of Tokyo, lectured around the world. His essays were published in a collection called \u201cNurturing Dreams\u201d by MIT Press in 2008. In it, he explored the Japanese sense of space called \u201coku,\u201d which Maki described as \u201cthe core of this high-density space organized into multiple layers like an onion.\u201d Utilizing oku allowed the Japanese to deliver a feeling of depth even in a cramped area, according to this theory. \u201cIn the formation of urban space, certain stable concepts that have been sifted and committed to memory by the collective unconscious of the community work automatically,\u201d Maki wrote. \u201cOku, a spatial concept peculiar to Japan, is a good example, and I believe an understanding of this way of perceiving space is important in formulating ideas of what future cities should be like.\u201d Maki was the second Japanese to win the Pritzker, hailed as the Nobel Prize of architecture, after Kenzo Tange, his mentor. Maki, along with fellow Tange students\u00a0Arata Isozaki\u00a0and\u00a0Kisho Kurokawa, were the pillars of Japanese modernism. The Pritzker, in selecting Maki, praised him as part of a new wave of architects rebuilding postwar Japan. \u201cHe uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of every design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony. He uses detail to give his structures rhythm and scale,\u201d Bill Lacy, a member of the international panel of jurors that selected Maki, said at the time. Maki was honored with other awards, such as the Wolf Prize from Israel in 1988 and the Arnold Brunner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1999. In 2011, the American Institute of Architects honored Maki with its highest accolade, the AIA Gold Medal. Japanese media reports said a memorial service was planned.

{"id": "style_article_liu-heung-shing-coca-cola-snap-mic-intl-hnk", "text": "A young man stands grinning in Beijing\u2019s Forbidden City. It\u2019s the dead of winter, and one of his hands is buried deep into the pockets of his long overcoat to protect it from the chill. The other grasps the unmistakable contours of a glass Coca-Cola bottle. Today, Coke is the world\u2019s most famous soft drink and can be found just about anywhere. But back in 1981, when the image was shot by Pulitzer-Prize winning photographer Liu Heung Shing, it was only just getting into the hands of ordinary Chinese people. Liu, who was in his late 20s when he began working for Time magazine in Beijing, felt the country was on the cusp of a great cultural shift following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976.  \u201cThe changes (at first) were subtle, and unless you lived there, you wouldn\u2019t have noticed,\u201d he recalled during an interview at his home in Hong Kong.  He had earlier photographed people grieving for Mao along the banks of the Pearl River in Guangzhou. It was here that he was struck by how differently people carried themselves compared to what he had seen in late-1950s China, where he grew up during the disastrous Great Leap Forward campaign \u2014 a series of failed industrialization policies \u2014 before moving back to Hong Kong as a child. Under Mao, the country went on to suffer from widespread famine and poverty, and the tumultuous years of the Cultural Revolution. But in the aftermath of the Chinese leader\u2019s death, Liu said, \u201csuddenly, people\u2019s steps looked a little bit lighter, they dropped their shoulders and their faces looked more relaxed.\u201d It would prove to be a relatively liberal period in Chinese history \u2014 politically, economically and in terms of everyday life, which Liu captured in candid shots. One photo from the time showed a plastic surgeon and his client after a cosmetic procedure. Another depicted people gathering at a \u201cDemocracy Wall\u201d in Beijing, where they wrote now-unthinkable criticisms of the government. One of Liu\u2019s most iconic images was captured on his way into the Time bureau after he had the strange feeling that something was \u201cmissing.\u201d He turned his car around and, sure enough, a large portrait of Mao that had once hung prominently on a building had been freshly taken down. He quickly shot images of workers gathered around the depiction of the late Chairman, with some of their scaffolding visible in the frame. This was China \u201cmoving out of the shadow of Mao,\u201d he said. \u2018It tastes so-so\u2019 In December 1978, Coca-Cola became the first foreign enterprise permitted to enter the mainland Chinese market since the communist revolution. That same month, Beijing and Washington announced the normalization of Sino-American relations and Deng Xiaoping kick-started China\u2019s transformative economic reforms with his \u201cOpen Door\u201d policy. (Coca-Cola was first introduced to China in the 1920s but had been forced to leave in 1949, along with other foreign companies, by a government that regarded it as bourgeois). Liu had photographed the opening of a joint-venture bottling plant in Beijing, capturing Coke chairman Roberto Goizueta and Chinese trade officials drinking Coca Cola and holding bottles aloft to cries of \u201cganbei\u201d (cheers). He then thought to himself, \u201cNow where do I find a (regular) Chinese person enjoying this (drink)?\u201d He headed to the Forbidden City, with its heavy flow of tourists, and soon found a man named Zhang Wei purchasing a Coke from a small stand. \u201cI remember he made a comment when he drank this syrupy Coke: \u2018It tastes so-so\u2019\u201d said Liu, who ended up taking a few shots with one of the imperial palace\u2019s picturesque pavilions in the background.  The response to Coke itself may have been underwhelming, but the snap perfectly captured the curiosity and openness many Chinese people felt at the time. \u201cAs a photographer, I of course realized the significance. That this man, dressed in a ubiquitous PLA (People\u2019s Liberation Army) coat, was one of the very first people to taste it,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cBut I didn\u2019t realize it would become part of the Chinese collective memory.\u201d The image would be widely published and displayed in the following years, and he later became friends with Zhang. In 1983, it appeared in Liu\u2019s photography book \u201cChina after Mao,\u201d a collection of images taken between 1976 and 1982. More recently he included it in his book \u201cLiu Heung Shing: A Life in a Sea of Red.\u201d   The photographer would go on to document other periods and profound events in the country\u2019s modern history, including the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. And just like those pictures of young student activists calling for democracy, Liu\u2019s Coca-Cola photograph feels part of another era altogether. With its apparent embrace of the new and the foreign \u2014 ideas encapsulated in that most American of drinks \u2014 the image stands in stark contrast to today\u2019s China, where relations with the US are at an all-time low. Xi Jinping\u2019s nationalist agenda has generated increasingly xenophobic attitudes towards the West.   \u201cI realized that the story I did in the last quarter of the 20th century (would) continue to carry relevance into the 21st century,\u201d Liu said. \u201cEspecially with the story of China, I never doubt that these photographs are in the Chinese people\u2019s collective memory. \u201cEven though this memory keeps being re-edited\u2026 the good thing about a photograph, is you cannot re-edit it. It becomes an image seared in people\u2019s minds.\u201d Top image: A 1981 photograph of a man with a Coke bottle in Beijing\u2019s Forbidden City, shot by Liu Heung Shing.

{"id": "2024_05_11_style_miss-usa-pageant-organization-allegations", "text": "During their year of service, pageant queens are highly visible, making appearances at major events, advocating for important causes and speaking at public engagements, all in an official capacity. But following the shocking double resignation of Miss USA 2023 Noelia Voigt and Miss Teen USA 2023 UmaSofia Srivastava this week, just days apart, insiders are painting a picture of national titleholders kept absent from their usual duties, their organization in disarray, and key players who appear to be unable to voice their experiences \u2014 and concerns. The Miss USA organization, which runs both pageants, has come under fire amid accusations of mismanagement, a hostile work environment, and conditions that led, in particular, to Voigt\u2019s resignation on the grounds that her role was impacting her mental health. While Srivastava, 16, who represented New Jersey at Miss Teen USA, released a statement on Instagram saying that her personal values \u201cno longer fully align\u201d with those of the organization, Voigt, 24, who represented Utah at Miss USA, wrote a long but cryptic post, citing her mental health. Soon, however, it went viral for an apparent hidden message \u2014 the first letter of the first 11 sentences spelled out \u201cI am silenced.\u201d (Voigt has not subsequently addressed this speculation.) \u201cWe respect and support Noelia\u2019s decision to step down from her duties,\u201d the Miss USA pageant said in a statement following Voigt\u2019s announcement. \u201cThe well-being of our titleholders is a top priority, and we understand her need to prioritize herself at this time.\u201d The organization has not returned CNN\u2019s request for further comment. In response, a number of current state titleholders who competed alongside Voigt for Miss USA \u2014 including Miss North Carolina USA 2023 Jordyn Ashlee McKey, Miss Wisconsin USA 2023 Alexis Loomans and Miss New York USA, Rachelle di Stasio \u2014 shared social media messages in support of Voigt, asking the organization to \u201crelease Noelia from the confidentiality NDA clause of her contract, in perpetuity, so that she is free to speak on her experiences and time as Miss USA.\u201d Denise White, a PR representative for both Srivastava and Voigt \u2014 and the 1994 Miss Oregon USA \u2014 alleged that both winners are restricted by \u201cironclad\u201d non-disclosure agreements in their contracts. To date, neither Voigt or Srivastava has publicly revealed more about what led them to quit. But in a resignation letter provided to the Miss USA organization and obtained by CNN, Voigt outlined a number of concerns, ranging from frustrating managerial issues to more serious allegations. In it, she described a \u201ctoxic work environment\u201d that \u201cat best, is poor management and, at worst, is bullying and harassment.\u201d She accused the pageant\u2019s CEO, Laylah Rose, of \u201cslandering\u201d her character in conversations with people inside and outside of the organization, including calling Voigt \u201cmentally ill.\u201d Rose is an entrepreneur and CEO of the VIP Pageantry Network, who took over the brand in 2023. Voigt says Rose\u2019s communications to her were \u201ccold and unnecessarily aggressive,\u201d and that she never received a formal meeting about her responsibilities. Despite the lack of communication about her role, she was \u201cconstantly\u2026 threatened with disciplinary action, including taking away my salary,\u201d according to the document. The organization failed to arrange travel accommodations for Voigt on multiple occasions, she wrote, and did not provide her with an apartment and car for months, as had been outlined in her prize package. Nor did she have an \u201ceffective handler,\u201d she claimed, the latter leading to an instance where Voigt says she was sexually harassed during a Christmas parade event in Sarasota, Florida, while alone with an unnamed person in a car. According to Voigt\u2019s letter, Rose is \u201cactively building a culture of fear and control, the antithesis of women\u2019s empowerment, that is\u2026unsafe for future titleholders and employees.\u201d Nor, she wrote, can she publicly voice her concerns, saying she is \u201csilenced contractually from being able to speak up for myself.\u201d \u2018Things are falling apart\u2019 Voigt and Srivastava\u2019s respective resignations were not coordinated, according to White. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve witnessed and seen is harassment, a toxic work environment and bullying,\u201d White said in a telephone interview with CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s just not conducive to a women\u2019s organization that uplifts women and is supposed to promote using your voice. It\u2019s quite the opposite.\u201d Both pageant winners sought out support from management at Miss Universe, which owns the Miss USA organization, without success, she added. \u201cBoth young ladies were always trying to resolve any issues quietly behind the scenes,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe fact that Miss Universe Organization has not even responded to Noelia\u2019s resignation at this point is just stonewalling\u2026 No wonder things are falling apart. Because nobody knows what to do.\u201d The Miss Universe organization and Rose, through Miss USA, did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Voigt\u2019s pageant coach, Thom Brodeur, who has worked with Miss USA contestants since 1991 and began working with Voigt while she was preparing for Miss Utah, emphasized new and ominous territory for the organization under Rose. \u201cNo woman has ever resigned as Miss USA or as Miss Teen USA, and she\u2019s lost both of them in 48 hours,\u201d he said. Even before Voigt and Srivastava stepped down, there was turmoil in the organization, according to White, Brodeur and Miss USA\u2019s former social media director, Claudia Engelhardt, who also resigned in recent days. Engelhardt claimed on Instagram that she had worked without pay for two months after being hired, and that she had seen a \u201cdecline\u201d in Voigt\u2019s mental health, and witnessed \u201cdisrespect\u201d toward Srivastava and members of her family. And according to Engelhardt, they were far from the only members of the Miss USA organization to depart. When she began her role in January, she was part of an already small team of five employees. Now, she says, after multiple firings and resignations, the team is down to Rose and one other employee. Multiple sources said the turnover has been constant. \u201cThis is not a state pageant. This is not a local pageant. You need\u2026 a whole team,\u201d Engelhardt said in a phone call with CNN. Engelhardt said she believed she was applying for a freelance role, and was surprised to find she was being hired as staff. Still, she claimed, she received no employee contract, no onboarding and no guidance. There was no one else to help her manage the day-to-day social media needs of the national brand, she said, and often came up against what she framed as Rose\u2019s overbearing approach to their social accounts. \u201cShe would block Instagram accounts with people that she had personal discrepancies with. She would censor comments, and she would leave comments for the Miss USA page as if she was Noelia,\u201d Engelhardt claimed. White also alleged that Rose impersonated the two pageant winners on their official accounts. Weeks before Voigt resigned, she announced in a now-deleted Instagram post on her personal account that she \u201cno longer had access\u201d to her Miss USA pages. An uneasy path forward Engelhardt said she witnessed firsthand the impact of the role on Voigt, who she considers a friend as well as a former colleague. \u201c(I saw) how stressed out she would get when the owner would constantly bombard her with emails,\u201d she recalled. \u201cShe was constantly living in an anxious state.\u201d But despite the day-to-day stressors, Voigt alleged that she only made few public appearances. She said in her letter that, aside from a handful of press interviews in Los Angeles following her win and subsequent ones in Utah, the state she had represented at the Miss USA pageant, she had \u201cyet to make an appearance outside of Sarasota, Florida,\u201d where she was living. This was due to a \u201clack of communication\u201d that she found \u201cbaffling,\u201d she wrote. \u201cOur Miss USA, who should have been booked and busy (with) endless opportunities was sitting around doing nothing, and it\u2019s not because she didn\u2019t want to, but because of mismanagement,\u201d Engelhardt said. On May 9, the Miss USA pageant announced that Savannah Gankiewicz, Miss Hawaii USA 2023 and first-runner up to Voigt at the 2023 Miss USA pageant, would be taking over the national title and its responsibilities. She will be officially crowned on May 15. \u201cWe are proud to crown Savannah Miss USA 2023, A true representation of vision, intelligence, and compassion,\u201d Rose said in a statement. \u201cHer dedication to empowering women through self-love and confidence is inspiring, and we look forward to her impactful reign as Miss USA.\u201d \u201cI fully support and respect Noelia\u2019s decision to step down, and I stand in solidarity with mental health awareness,\u201d Gankiewicz\u00a0added. \u201cTo my fellow Miss USA sisters, I believe it\u2019s crucial for us to stand united for the future of the organization and the incoming class of 2024 and beyond.\u201d Though many have offered their public support for the two resigned pageant winners \u2014 including\u00a0Shanna Moakler, who oversaw Voigt\u2019s win in her role as the state director for the Miss Utah USA pageant, and Cindy Provost and Debbie Miller, who oversaw Srivastava\u2019s win in their role as state directors for the Miss New Jersey Teen USA pageant \u2014 Engelhardt and White both hope that others will step up to reveal more about what they see as a stifling culture, as well as potential legal ramifications, that are keeping the titleholders quiet. \u201cThey need somebody else to speak up for them,\u201d White said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/style/miss-usa-pageant-organization-allegations/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}

Shields, 59, speaks regularly about the confidence she has found as she has gotten older. \u201cI\u2019m so excited about this age and era of life because I\u2019m less complicated, less insecure, less egomaniacal, and I\u2019m focusing on that,\u201d she recently told Vogue. Chunky, with signature Swiss cheese holes and often in jarringly bright colors; since their debut in 2004, Crocs have divided opinion \u2014 and often been derided by fashion insiders and experts. But the clogs, made of a special resin called Croslite, are loved by comfort-seekers, and they do have a track record with celebrities too. Singer Justin Bieber paired an oversized Balenciaga suit with platform Crocs to the 2022 Grammys (his own clothing brand Drew House has collaborated with the label in the past), while record producer Questlove wore a shiny golden pair to the 2021 Oscars. Even as far back as 2015, actor Alan Cumming (pictured above) sported Crocs to the Emmys with his Vivienne Westwood ensemble. Founded in Boulder, Colorado by three friends in 2002, Crocs were an immediate success when they first hit the market. By 2007 the company was selling 50 million pairs a year. But the 2008 financial crisis and a saturated market saw the company go from $200 million in profit in 2007 to $200 million in losses the next year. In recent years, the company has teamed up with brands and celebrities to release special editions. There was a glow-in-the-dark collaboration with Puerto Rican musician Bad Bunny in 2020, which sold out soon after its release, a lime green crossover with Dreamwork\u2019s \u201cShrek\u201d in 2023 and a long-running partnership with Balenciaga that\u2019s yielded an assortment of Crocs boots, stilettos, and platforms. These efforts may be paying off: Crocs reported a record year of earnings in 2023, with total revenue reaching nearly $4 billion dollars. Will they become a red carpet mainstay? Probably not, but Shields\u2019 outfit did garner plenty of support from her fans on social media: \u201cYou\u2019re a trend setter and a very cool one at that!\u201d wrote one commenter below the actor\u2019s Instagram post showing off her Crocs. \u201cWe are utterly obsessed,\u201d said another.

{"id": "2024_04_20_style_park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli", "text": "Everyone knows the familiar shapes that make up New York\u2019s skyline. There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_style_last-safe-abortion-photos", "text": "Sixty years ago this month, a young woman died alone from a self-induced abortion she and her lover had conducted on a motel room floor in Norwich, Connecticut. Her name was Gerri Santoro. Santoro\u2019s death was one of many \u2014 all too many \u2014 which activists and healthcare workers sought to avoid by legalizing abortions and abortion care in the United States. But she became a particular symbol of this movement when a graphic police photograph of her dead body was printed in the feminist publication Ms. Magazine in April 1973, just a few months after the US Supreme Court\u2019s Roe v. Wade decision\u00a0legally protected\u00a0the medical procedure. Today, in the aftermath of that half-century-old ruling being overturned on June 24, 2022 \u2014 a decision which some people fear has triggered the resurgence of conditions,\u00a0and restrictions,\u00a0similar to those that contributed to Santoro\u2019s death \u2014 one artist is reinvigorating visual advocacy of abortion, aiming to change the cultural mindset toward it and those who provide the procedure. Carmen Winant\u2019s new photobook, \u201cThe Last Safe Abortion,\u201d also seeks to memorialize the labor, advocacy and community-building of abortion care providers and women\u2019s health care workers in the near-50-year period that the right to an abortion was legally protected\u00a0across the US. Though particularly salient at this time, Winant\u2019s book isn\u2019t a direct response to the Roe repeal, she told CNN. Rather, the idea had been percolating in her mind for some time, she explained, sparked by having to regularly circumnavigate \u201caggressive\u201d anti-abortion activists proselytizing on the campus of Ohio State University, where she\u2019s an associate professor in the art department. \u201cTheir (visual) strategy is really clear and specific and has been specific for the past three or four decades: blowing up these photographs of so-called aborted fetuses that are really gory and sensational, and using (them) as a confrontational device,\u201d Winant said. \u201cIt really ignited this line of inquiry \u2026 around photography and movement building and consciousness raising. \u201cWhere are our pictures? Where are the pictures of people who are pro-choice and invested in reproductive justice and health care work?\u201d Winant recalled thinking. \u201cWhy have we been so reticent or slow to utilize pictures in our movements?\u201d MYA Network, a national group of clinicians, activists and patients working to normalize abortion care, has also embraced this effort. One of MYA\u2019s initiatives is The Issue of Tissue, which depicts fetal tissues up to around nine weeks old, showing the reality of what early abortions look like, in contrast to the often misleading images long circulated by anti-abortion advocates. Winant is actually best known for her work on birth \u2014 particularly a 2018 Museum of Modern Art exhibit called \u201cMy Birth,\u201d which showed more than 2,000 found photographs \u2014 largely from the 1970s \u2014 drawing from birthing experiences, birth workers and feminist literature. \u201cI am moved by birth in its own right \u2014 as a mysterious and expansive phenomenological experience \u2014 but most of all I am interested in it as a channel through which to study feminist healthcare networks and the building of radical social movements,\u201d Winant wrote in her book. \u201cGiving women information (pictorial or otherwise) about their bodies is a tool of feminist world-building.\u201d \u201cThe Last Safe Abortion\u201d is a continuation of this theme, Winant says. The book demands that the labor and humanity of abortion care providers \u2014 often both invisible and vilified \u2014 be included and appreciated in social and political conversations about reproductive rights, which often also ignore birthing people and women\u2019s healthcare workers. \u201cIt was really important for me to politically put people back in the picture,\u201d Winant told CNN. A long fight for the right to choose Winant drew the collection of photos she curated for her book from more than a dozen institutional, organizational and personal archives, as well as her own, largely centered on the Midwest \u2014 a \u201cparticularly vulnerable area\u201d for reproductive rights, she said.\u00a0  The first photographs in the book are of the interiors of a clinic waiting room, putting viewers into the shoes of a hypothetical staffer or patient who has just walked in, Winant said. From here, the goings on are all too ordinary \u2014 and mundane: Clinic employees demonstrate procedures, replace batteries in clocks, hold workshops, sterilize equipment, check patients in for appointments and celebrate each other\u2019s birthdays. Notably, none show strife or confrontations with protestors, in contrast to the visual narratives that often surround abortion care. The clinics exist in their own context, as a place of safety and community. \u201cThat also felt political: to demonstrate that this work is quotidian and regular and unsensational,\u201d Winant said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much care and dignity \u2014 small steps that are put into making people feel safe. It\u2019s such a significant part of their job.\u201d To Winant, something as simple as answering phones represented a heroic act of solidarity \u2014 \u201cnetworking to save each other\u2019s lives,\u201d she said. The book\u2019s title reflects this mission. As Winant spoke with clinics and their staff in the wake of the Roe overturning, one refrain she consistently heard was the promise and determination to \u201cprovide the last safe abortion\u201d in their state. \u201c\u2018If we do the last legal abortion in Ohio, that is what we will do. We will stay open for as long as we possibly can,\u2019\u201d Winant recalled one staffer saying. \u201cWords as resolute as they are elegiac.\u201d Winant has never really been interested in art for art\u2019s sake, she told CNN, but rather in how it \u201ccirculates in the world and (its) power to impact people on a political level, but also on a deeper level, like something more cellular.\u201d Winant\u2019s work, as well as her own life, also rejects the notion that people who support or have abortions live on one side of the binary to which the debate over abortion rights is often reduced. \u201cThe right to be pregnant and give birth has everything to do with a right to be what feminists would call \u2018unpregnant,\u2019 and not to give birth,\u201d Winant said. \u201cAs someone who has had children, as someone who has had an abortion, that is the same struggle (when) it comes to choice \u2014 and not only our own choices, but the feminist health care networks that support those choices.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/style/last-safe-abortion-photos/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "style_article_reuben-wu-landscape-photography", "text": "The first time Reuben Wu saw the warm sandstone hues and vast, open skies of the American West, he was watching the landscapes pass him by from the window of a tour bus.  The British visual artist, now based in Chicago, has become known for his sublime imagery of remote landscapes using drone lighting, enhancing craggy peaks with halos, or writing glyphs in the sky like signals from a supernatural entity. But for a long time, art was just a passion project while he focused on a music career as one of the four members of the synth-pop band Ladytron. \u201c(Photography) started as an all-consuming hobby,\u201d he explained in a phone interview. But when Ladytron took a break in 2011 after five studio albums (they released a self-titled sixth album in 2019, and the seventh, \u201cTime\u2019s Arrow,\u201d this month), he began a new career from scratch. \u201cWhile the others did their own solo projects, making their own music and releasing their own albums, this was my solo project.\u201d Wu\u2019s imagery takes a classic photographer\u2019s combination \u2014 light and landscape \u2014 and marries the two in transformative ways. He often begins with dusky evening light or the ink-black shadows of night, then strategically illuminates portions of the scene with custom-built consumer drones. In one image, a bright horizontal line hangs over a glacier in the Peruvian Andes, revealing the brilliance of the ice against a dark sky. In a different motion piece, Wu simulated an electrical storm in Goblin Valley, Utah, but with perfectly straight strikes of light rather than the jagged bursts of lightning.  The artist\u2019s 2018 photo book \u201cLux Noctis\u201d is in the collections of the Guggenheim and Museum of Modern Art, in New York, and he has shot commercial work for Apple, Audi and Google as well as the DJ and music producer Zedd. Last summer, Wu revealed a colossal project for National Geographic: a cover story and timelapse multimedia piece about Stonehenge, which featured the enigmatic monument lit by his custom drones. In November, one of his NFTs, a 4K video loop titled \u201cAn Irresistible Force,\u201d outperformed its high estimate by over 25% during an auction at Sotheby\u2019s Hong Kong, selling at 441,000 HKD (about $56,500). \u201cI couldn\u2019t have dreamed of where I am now,\u201d Wu said. \u201cI just wanted to be able to make a living from doing art and from doing photography.\u201d  Alien inspiration Wu has always been drawn to wild, remote places where he could find solitude. His parents immigrated from Hong Kong to the UK before he was born, and he grew up an introverted child in Liverpool, he said, who didn\u2019t quite click with school. He was fascinated with science-fiction films that mix the alien with the everyday, such as Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind,\u201d which featured Wyoming\u2019s Devils Tower as a site for extraterrestrial contact. (Unfamiliar with American topography, he initially thought the butte, a national monument, was a fictional geological entity, he explained with a laugh).  The film\u2019s visuals of remote desert scenes mixed with eerie lights have been a formative inspiration in his own work. \u201c(It\u2019s) cemented into my brain, the idea of these seemingly impossible lights moving through the sky, kind of like search lights on very ordinary (American) landscapes,\u201d he said.  He embarked on his first cross-country photography trip across the US in 2013, around a decade after getting a taste on the road with Ladytron. The resulting series featured vivid depictions of the Grand Canyon and South Dakota Badlands, as well as a time-lapse image of Devils Tower at night among star trails.  Two years later, Wu discovered the effect that drone lighting could have on the natural world while working on an outdoor automotive shoot. \u201cI flew the drone up above some cliffs, and I was absolutely fascinated by the effect it had on the actual landscape,\u201d he explained. It made the cliffs glow, reaching areas that were otherwise impossible to light artificially.  Wu rigs lights on drones to suit his needs on any given shoot or project. The first iteration, he said, which he used when the technology was still nascent, was a \u201cmassive\u201d eight-rotor drone outfitted with homemade lights that only had about eight minutes of flight time. The next used a 3D-printed bracket with an LED hot light, but still only gave him an additional two minutes in the air. The tech he uses now gives him a bit more breathing room, with a half hour to fly out, capture images and return to him, but he\u2019s had to learn to work within the bounds of each set-up. \u201cI\u2019m a lot less anxious now, because I\u2019ve crashed a number of drones,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in the end, they\u2019re just tools.\u201d  Experimental series After developing series of still images such as \u201cLux Noctis\u201d and \u201cAeroglyphs,\u201d which experiment with ghostly lighting and geometric shapes in the skies, Wu found himself wanting to incorporate motion and sound into his work because of his own background in music. He began creating 15-second video loops from his images, showing light beams forming patterns or the moon arcing across the sky, to the beats of atmospheric electronic music that he produced. \u201cThese (works) were very much experimental and had no end goal \u2014 they were just things that I did for love out of love,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t license them, I couldn\u2019t print them\u2026 and so they were just there, stacking likes on my Instagram.\u201d But in January 2021, Wu found a way to make them a more substantial part of his career when he was introduced to NFT art. He minted his first \u201cnon-fungible token\u201d  on the marketplace Foundation two months later \u2014 an \u201caeroglyph\u201d of bright lines forming a rectangle above a beachside cliff. It sold for 30 ETH ($45,000), a portion of which he donated to the National Parks Conservation Association and the AAPI Community Fund. Later that year, the web3 arts organization Obscura commissioned him to produce a new set of images titled \u201cAeroglyph Variations,\u201d which took him into the New Mexico badlands for a 20-hour shoot that resulted in 55 images of the same setting, each with different lighting conditions and patterns. Wu has also experimented with presenting the work in different ways, from animations, to AR experiences, to projection mapping moving images onto physical prints. \u201cIt\u2019s very much a hybrid medium, and so I\u2019d like to expand that horizon even more, and think about the end goal for my work,\u201d he said. \u201cAm I creating a nice piece of art for people to look at and appreciate, or am I creating an experience for people to share?\u201d Wu is leaning towards the latter as he continues to experiment with the form his work takes, but no matter the medium, his vision of and approach to the natural world remains consistent. \u201cA lot of people always say that my work is otherworldly \u2014 that is the first word that people think of when they think about my work,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not trying to create an alien-looking image; I\u2019m trying to show that this is our planet. And there are so many new ways that are available to see it that can renew your perspective.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/article/reuben-wu-landscape-photography/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_style_franz-kafka-letter-writers-block-auction-intl-scli", "text": "A letter giving a rare insight into Franz Kafka\u2019s struggle with writer\u2019s block is going up for auction. Best-known for the 1915 novella \u201cThe Metamorphosis,\u201d the Prague-born Jewish writer struggled throughout his short life with anxiety, hopelessness and isolation \u2013 themes that came to define his work \u2013 but little has been known about his creative process. The one-page letter, which is expected to sell for \u00a370,000 to \u00a390,000 ($89,000 to $115,000) at Sotheby\u2019s in London, is dated to spring 1920, according to the auction house. This means it would have been written while Kafka was undergoing treatment for tuberculosis, with which he was diagnosed three years earlier. He took intermittent sick leave from his job with an insurance company and would often spend periods at sanatoriums. He retired in 1922 and died in a clinic near Vienna two years later. \u201cI haven\u2019t written anything for three years, what\u2019s published now are old things, I don\u2019t have any other work, not even started,\u201d Kafka lamented in the letter, written in German and addressed to his friend, the Austrian poet Albert Ehrenstein. Giving a reason for this literary dry spell, Kafka wrote: \u201cWhen worries have penetrated to a certain layer of inner existence, writing and complaining obviously cease, indeed my resistance was not too strong.\u201d The letter was written in response to Ehrenstein asking him to contribute to his magazine, Sotheby\u2019s said in a media statement issued Monday. Ehrenstein made the request after seeing a newly published work by Kafka \u2013 probably the 1919 short story collection \u201cEin Landarzt\u201d (\u201cA Country Doctor\u201d). \u201cThe life and works of Franz Kafka have long been a source of fascination throughout the world,\u201d Sotheby\u2019s Books & Manuscripts specialist Gabriel Heaton said in the release. \u201cThe letter reveals how writing made intense demands on him, and required deep reserves of inner strength, as he grappled with deep insecurity and worry about the futility of his work. We can also all be thankful that Kafka would continue to pick up his pen despite his crippling writer\u2019s block,\u201d he added. At the time the letter was written, Kafka had also begun an intense love affair with Czech journalist and writer Milena Jesensk\u00e1. So, despite his physical health continuing to decline, Kafka was given renewed confidence with Jesensk\u00e1\u2019s support and was able to begin his final literary endeavors, including \u201cA Hunger Artist\u201d and \u201cThe Castle,\u201d according to the release. Both these books were published posthumously, in 1924 and 1926, respectively \u2013 despite Kafka requesting that his unpublished manuscripts be destroyed upon his death. Though he was sought out by avant-garde publishers during his life, Kafka\u2019s greatest literary acclaim came posthumously. His works, all written in German, were rediscovered in Germany and Austria after 1945, and he began to have a huge influence on German literature that extended globally by the 1960s. They have been widely adapted for the cinema, TV and theater.

{"id": "style_article_sunil-gupta-india-gate-snap", "text": "To passersby, the sight of two men embracing besides New Delhi\u2019s India Gate in 1986 might have seemed unremarkable. In a city where public displays of platonic male affection are relatively commonplace, it was photographer Sunil Gupta who attracted more attention at the time. \u201cMen holding hands or lying in each other\u2019s laps is not an issue \u2014 it looks very romantic from (the outside), but they\u2019re usually just hanging out,\u201d he said in a video interview from the UK, before recalling: \u201cI was creating more interest than them, because I was standing there with a tripod and a camera, so everybody was focused on me.\u201d Onlookers may not have realized, but Gupta was creating a subtly subversive image in what he has described as the \u201crepressive atmosphere\u201d of 1980s India. At a time when homosexuality was more taboo in the country than it is today \u2014 and with consensual gay sex then criminalized as an \u201cunnatural offense\u201d \u2014 the photographer had found his subjects via the informal networks constituting Delhi\u2019s gay scene. The pair in question had chosen the war monument\u2019s gardens for their photo shoot due to its reputation as a cruising spot.  Having lived in New Delhi until his mid-teens, London-based Gupta knew this from personal experience. \u201cI passed that place on my way to school every day for 11 years,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just had to hop off the bus and get laid on your way home. It was very easy.\u201d The image forms part of the photographer\u2019s series \u201cExiles,\u201d which was first exhibited in the UK in 1987 but is this week showing at the India Art Fair in New Delhi. Primarily shot outdoors around India\u2019s capital, it captures gay men sat on benches or in public places popular among those looking for casual sexual partners, their faces often out of shot or turned away from the camera. Concerned about \u201couting\u201d his subjects, Gupta treated them as collaborators in what he called a \u201cconstructed documentary\u201d approach. After shooting his images and developing the film in London, he returned to Delhi with printed contact sheets to ensure the men were comfortable with the pictures he selected for his show. \u201cThere was quite a bit of horsing around in the pictures,\u201d he said of the India Gate shoot. \u201cAnd there were other photos that were (more suggestive)\u2026 So I picked a somewhat tamer one to put in the series.\u201d The other ethical challenge, he recalled, was communicating to the duo how the images would be used \u2014 and the art of photography itself. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t for publication, and the only way they saw pictures was in a magazine, so it took some explaining,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThen I tried to explain the process.\u201d Photography for many at the time, Gupta observed, was still \u201ca very mysterious thing that only a few people did in a darkroom.\u201d   For \u2018the canon\u2019  Now among India\u2019s most celebrated photographic artists, Gupta often addressed LGBTQ experiences in his explorations of race, immigration and identity. While studying in the US in the mid-1970s he produced a now-celebrated series of photos from New York\u2019s Christopher Street that captured the city\u2019s gay scene in the years between the Stonewall Riots and onset of the AIDS epidemic. Although \u201cExiles\u201d presented a rare portrait of gay life outside the West, Gupta\u2019s intended audience was always back in London. Homophobia was rife in 1980s Britain, and the photographer said he faced \u201ca lot of hostility\u201d at art school for making work relating to his sexuality. \u201cI couldn\u2019t make gay work, and I couldn\u2019t make gay work about India, especially,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was none in the library for reference. So, I thought, \u2018I\u2019m making it my mission to make some. Not for India, but for this canon \u2014 we need to have gay Indian guys in our library, in our art schools, over here.\u2019\u201d New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art has since acquired several of the pictures for its permanent collection, signifying the series\u2019 place in contemporary photography. But it was not an instant success. \u201cIt didn\u2019t have any impact when it was first shown,\u201d Gupta said of its debut.  \u201cI think it was too early.\u201d By the 1990s, however, interest in Gupta\u2019s work was growing, as art made by, and about, gay people of color became increasingly visible in the West. The fact that \u201cExiles\u201d is now showing in India, where he said it is positively received, is testament to changes on the subcontinent, too.  Although the country\u2019s LGBTQ communities still face significant social stigma, gay sex was decriminalized in 2018 and the arrival of apps like Grindr have been transformative, Gupta said. (\u201cThose sorts of chance meetings behind the bush are not happening \u2014 or maybe happening less,\u201d he added). This modern context and the power of hindsight have helped paint the photos in a new light. \u201cI think it has become historical enough that people are curious about what gay life was like before Grindr and the internet,\u201d Gupta said. \u201cPeople think it was all doom and gloom, and people jumping off buildings. They don\u2019t seem to appreciate that we also managed to have some kind of a life back then.\u201d This is a message reflected in the photographer\u2019s carefree India Gate shoot, which he recounts as a relaxed day of fun and abundant sunlight. \u201cIt just seemed very pleasurable. It was a nice day out, and I got to hang out with these guys who were having a good time and having a laugh.\u201d \u201cExiles\u201d is showing via Vadehra Art Gallery at India Art Fair, which runs February 9-12 in New Delhi, India.

{"id": "2024_06_05_style_how-the-super-rich-ship-their-cars", "text": "Ameerh Naran is relentlessly international. Born and raised in Zimbabwe to an Indian family of shoemakers, he once became Harare\u2019s first importer of sex toys. After going on to make millions in private aviation (his planes have been used by celebrities, politicians and on \u201cKeeping Up With The Kardashians\u201d), he now spends most of his time in Dubai and London \u2014 which can present logistical challenges for driving his fleet of cars. \u201cI have a rare Porsche Carrera GT that cost me \u00a31.5m ($1.9m) and I keep it at the airport in Dubai,\u201d says Naran, whose company, Vimana Private Jets, also has offices in Los Angeles and New York. \u201cIf I fly anywhere, Emirates will put it on the earliest flight to wherever I\u2019m going so my car meets me there.\u201d Naran, who\u2019s 38, is one of thousands of wealthy car owners who think little of buying plane tickets for their automobiles, taking advantage of specialist freight services for cars that many of the major airlines offer, particularly those based in the Middle East. An ecosystem of car transport specialists has evolved to work with the airlines and the family offices of the ultra-rich so that favored vehicles magically follow them around the globe. It\u2019s traditionally a busy time of year for these services as the richest residents of the Gulf states prepare to jet off to cooler climes for the summer after Ramadan. The last time Naran flew his Porsche from Dubai to London on Emirates, he says it cost \u00a328,000 ($36,000) \u2014 a little more than he could have paid after landing for a brand-new Golf at a West London Volkswagen dealership. But then serious car guys tend not to want to be seen in family hatchbacks. \u201cI also have jet clients who are very wealthy and less price sensitive than me and don\u2019t want to put their cars on commercial airlines, in which case they\u2019ll charter a cargo plane from us, which costs in the millions,\u201d Naran tells me from Cape Town where\u2019s he\u2019s just arrived for a wedding, without the need for a car. The ultra-wealthy will often take whole fleets of cars with them when they travel, loading vehicles, along with motorbikes and other toys, onto chartered cargo aircraft that follow their private jets. Covered trucks are used to complete journeys to clients\u2019 addresses or garages; owners baulk at the idea of random delivery drivers adding mileage to their beloved cars. Naran says his richest clients barely blink at such excesses; one recently chartered a cargo plane to be ready to fly straight away when his newly acquired Samsung TV wouldn\u2019t fit through the door of his own jet. Rare cars can be worth millions, but not always. \u201cI have one client who transports a Nissan Patrol 4x4\u201d Naran says. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that it\u2019s worth anything, but he likes it and it\u2019s costing him millions to fly it around with his Bugatti.\u201d Dan Hallworth started shipping cars about 15 years ago after cutting his teeth at his uncle\u2019s freight firm in Manchester, England, after finishing school. Back then he says most of the business was in the summer and tended to involve cars coming from the Middle East to London. Newspapers used to be full of reports of hypercars roaring around chichi parts of the British capital at the hands of Qatari princes who cared little for speed limits or the parking fines they collected outside luxury department store Harrods. Hallworth, who says he can send a car between Dubai and London for around \u00a310,000 ($13,000) on cheaper airlines, says the market has changed since then. Police and councils in London started to clampdown on the showiest drivers, and viral videos of watch muggings and other crimes have put many of his clients off London. \u201cNow they go skiing and everything like that and it\u2019s much more all-year-round,\u201d says Hallworth, whose company, Dan Car Logistics, now ships more than 100 vehicles a year by air and thousands more by road. His clients are still mostly based in the Middle East and include royal families. He recently transported a \u201chumongous\u201d Mercedes to Los Angeles for \u00a320,000 ($25,000) and a \u00a312m ($15.3m) bespoke Bugatti Chiron Hermes edition to Marbella, Spain, for a Qatari prince. If anything, he says, the flow of wheels has reversed; he\u2019s often transporting cars from London to Dubai for people travelling or doing business there. It\u2019s a trend the airlines are noticing too; Etihad Cargo tells me the greatest demand for its FlightValet car shipping service is now in the UK. More than half of the 139 shipments of 151 cars it flew in 2023 originated from Heathrow, mostly bound for Abu Dhabi and Dubai. December was the busiest month, and the biggest destinations for cars leaving the UAE were Frankfurt, Zurich and Chicago. Etihad will only deal with registered freight agents rather than individuals \u2014 cars are considered to be \u201cdangerous goods\u201d and the paperwork required for them to clear customs can be extensive. Hallworth, who\u2019s 33, says an annual insurance policy covers all his work, the cost of which he includes in his fees. Occasionally he politely declines new customers if things seem, well, a little off. \u201cWe always want the owner\u2019s ID, the registration documents of the cars and to get a feel of the customer,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be just, like, \u2018yeah I can do that\u2019, and the next minute you\u2019ve got a stolen car on a plane and some serious questions to answer.\u201d Like Naran, who is now developing his own hypercar (the Naran will be yours for north of \u00a32m or $2.6m), Hallworth has grown his business thanks to word-of-mouth marketing at the highest levels. This can occasionally present him with tricky requests. \u201cI\u2019ve been asked to transport horses and camels,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not really my bag, and I would never say yes to a job if I\u2019m not 100% sure the cargo is going to be alive when it arrives.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/style/how-the-super-rich-ship-their-cars/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_style_spinel-tourmaline-gemstones", "text": "In 2016, jeweler Olivia Young of Ouroboros sold a red spinel ring for \u00a36,000 ($7,700). Last year, the client\u2019s insurance company paid out \u00a330,000 ($38,400) to replace it. Experts say that this previously overlooked gemstone is rocketing in desirability and value, as collectors look beyond the so-called \u201cBig Four\u2019\u201d (diamonds, emeralds, rubies and sapphires) for more affordable, niche gemstones that may just be a shrewd investment. Found in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Tajikistan and some African countries, spinels come in a range of colors, from vivid blue, pink and red to dusky grey, green and purple. Until they were properly identified in the 18th century, red spinels were called rubies; the 170-carat Black Prince\u2019s Ruby at the front of the Imperial State Crown, part of the British Crown Jewels, is in fact a spinel. In 2015, the auction house Bonhams sold the 50.13-carat Hope Spinel for a world-record \u00a3962,500 ($1.22m) \u2014 over six times its estimate \u2014 helping to catapult the stone into public consciousness. \u201cHistorically, spinels have been regarded as less important and therefore more affordable, but they are becoming increasingly desirable,\u201d said Jennifer Tonkin, Bonhams co-head of jewelry, over email. She noted that \u201cfire-engine red\u201d and hot-pink spinels from Burma, as well as rose-pink examples from Tajikistan, are most sought after by connoisseurs. Rahul Kadakia, international head of jewelry at Christie\u2019s, agreed that pink and purple spinels \u201cshould continue to see market appreciation,\u201d and shared that fine examples sell for up to $25,000 per carat. \u201cThe escalating prices of the \u201cbig four\u201d gems have compelled buyers to explore unconventional alternatives,\u201d he said in an email, but explained that appreciation of spinels\u2019 rich colors is no new phenomenon. \u201cThey were, after all, one of the favorite gems of Mughal rulers.\u201d A matter of ethics London-based jeweler Lily Gabriella features spinels in myriad shades in her one-off collectors\u2019 edition designs. She has seen a \u201cnotable increase\u201d in their price, reflecting \u201cboth their aesthetic appeal and their rarity\u201d she said via email, adding that spinels are \u201coften sourced from small-scale operations, presenting fewer ethical concerns compared to other stones.\u201d Charles Abouchar, director of Abouchar SA, a Geneva-based dealer who exhibits at the trade show Gem Gen\u00e8ve, said that rising demand for colored gemstones has led to a shortage of quality specimens, driving up prices. \u201cAs rubies, sapphires, and emeralds have become very expensive and scarce, people have begun buying other gemstones that were previously more affordable, causing prices to rise significantly,\u201d he said over email. \u201cSpinels and Paraiba tourmalines have seen a steady increase in demand over the last decade.\u201d Originally discovered in the 1980s in a now-exhausted mine in the Brazilian state of Paraiba, this once-niche variety of tourmaline is distinctive for its electric turquoise color, the result of traces of copper. Experts posit that only one Paraiba tourmaline is mined for every 10,000 diamonds \u2014 and while similar hues are found in Madagascar, the scarcity of Brazilian stones has seen prices soar. At Bonhams, Tonkin said prices for top-quality Paraiba tourmalines reached $75,000 per carat in 2022, compared with $4,800 per carat in 2009. Roberto Boghossian, Managing Partner of the jewelry house Boghossian, added that the price of Paraiba tourmalines has doubled in the last three to five years, which he attributes to their \u201crarity, beauty and enduring appeal,\u201d describing their neon glow as \u201ca refreshing alternative to more traditional gemstones.\u201d Moti Ferder, founder of Lugano Diamonds, began working with Paraiba tourmalines over 20 years ago. \u201cThere is an undeniable attraction to them \u2014 they are very rare and absolutely mesmerizing,\u201d he said in an email. Ferder foresees continued growth in value as demand increases and supply diminishes, \u201cmaking it one of the market\u2019s most coveted and prized gemstones.\u201d So, what if you\u2019re already priced out of the market for a Paraiba? Olivia Young is buying as much tourmaline from Afghanistan as she can, because these newer deposits offer \u201cincredibly beautiful bi-chrome material that\u2019s blue-green in one direction and grass-green at 90 degrees,\u201d describing them as \u201cthe most exquisite and vibrant gemstones I have ever seen.\u201d Likewise, gemmologist and founder of Minka Jewels Lucy Crowther counts blue-green tourmalines as the connoisseur\u2019s choice, having personally discovered them in India 15 years ago. \u201cThese incredibly vibrant, clean gemstones really stirred something in me,\u201d she explained\u00a0in an email. Now, she sources top-quality examples for unconventional engagement rings and colorful cocktail rings. \u201cWith lab-grown diamonds becoming increasingly popular, colored stones are a great choice for those wanting to stand out and have something natural that is also unique.\u201d Crowther and Young are both determined to educate clients that there\u2019s more to life than the Big Four. \u201cI believe across the board, that tourmalines of top-quality material and significant sizes will sky-rocket,\u201d said Young. \u201cThere is a finite amount of the incredible material and it is exceptionally beautiful, so I can only see its popularity exploding.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/style/spinel-tourmaline-gemstones/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "style_article_moshe-safdie-architect-singapore", "text": "There are few buildings that have more drastically shaped a city\u2019s image than Marina Bay Sands. Just as the Eiffel Tower and Burj Khalifa define the skylines of Paris and Dubai, the soaring three-tower resort, joined across the top by a horizontal \u201cskypark\u201d and the world\u2019s most famous infinity pool, is an icon both in and of Singapore. In fact, the hotel-casino project is so successful that the man who designed it doesn\u2019t even stay there. \u201cIt\u2019s too noisy,\u201d said Israeli-Canadian architect Moshe Safdie. \u201cI\u2019m a swimmer and I can never get in the pool because there are so many people taking pictures.\u201d Now resuming his once-frequent trips to Singapore amid easing travel restrictions, Safdie prefers the nearby Ritz-Carlton, where we meet for afternoon tea. (\u201cI had a British mother,\u201d he explained, \u201cso I\u2019m a sucker for scones and tea.\u201d) At a top-floor table overlooking his best-known creation, he reflected on the sometimes-fraught task of designing contemporary landmarks. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t on my mind as much as it was on their minds,\u201d he clarified, recounting the call for design proposals issued by the city-state\u2019s government in the mid-2000s. \u201cThey didn\u2019t quite say the building should become the icon of Singapore, but they talked about it being iconic.  \u201cWhen we made the submission, I said, \u2018Some buildings have the magic to become memorable and associated with a place.\u2019 And I mentioned Sydney Opera House as the classic contemporary example. But, I said, \u2018It\u2019s a mystery what makes that happen.\u2019\u201d The trick, it transpired, was designing something striking yet simple. Constructing a 0.2-mile-long cantilevered roof terrace atop three skyscrapers required a feat of complex engineering but, at its most abstract, Marina Bay Sands can be sketched in four basic strokes. In Singapore Sign Language, the landmark is referenced by simply raising three fingers of one hand and resting another digit across the top. Visible for miles around, it appears on postcards and newscast backdrops. The structure also stars in the official Singapore Lego set, which the architect proudly displays at his office back in Somerville, Massachusetts.  \u201cThat kind of stuff, you can\u2019t quite plan for or design \u2013 it just happens,\u201d he said of the building\u2019s success. \u201cBut I\u2019m very happy about it. It changed our lives in terms of the work we get.\u201d  Safdie\u2019s eponymous firm is in high demand. In the years since Marina Bay Sands opened in 2010, he has realized almost 20 major projects. Among them are the serene Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas and a dual-tower residential complex in Colombo, Sri Lanka, that sees one high-rise lean dramatically against the other. The architect also bequeathed Singapore with another landmark in 2019: Jewel, a nature-themed entertainment and retail complex that attracts throngs of Instagrammers to Changi Airport each day thanks to its verdant indoor waterfall.  Safdie has said he considers seeing finished projects in use to be among an architect\u2019s greatest pleasures. He makes a point of visiting Jewel whenever he\u2019s in Singapore. \u201cI was concerned about how the plants were doing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I was relieved to see they\u2019re thriving.\u201d The architect is not in Singapore to indulge in past glories, however. In the days after our interview, he will inspect two new developments: a gardenesque office complex in the island\u2019s west and a pair of residential towers on the upmarket Orchard Road. The latter features multiple skybridges \u2013 a recurring theme in Safdie\u2019s work that was recently taken to new extremes in Chongqing, China, where he lay a gargantuan \u201chorizontal skyscraper\u201d (containing an infinity pool, restaurants and an indoor garden) atop four 820-foot-tall towers.   Then there is the small matter of Marina Bay Sands\u2019 second phase. The expansion plans feature, among other things, a fourth tower \u2013 though Safdie dismissed early suggestions that his iconic skypark might be extended to rest across its top. In any case, Singapore officials have expressed that he shouldn\u2019t, in his words, \u201cscrew around\u201d with an icon. Instead, the new tower will stand apart from the other three, forming \u201csort of an exclamation mark,\u201d he explained, motioning punctuative strokes: \u201cBoooom\u2026 boom.\u201d  Radical vision  At 84, Safdie shows little sign of slowing down. Other recent trips have taken him to Sao Paolo, Brazil, where his glass-roofed Albert Einstein Education and Research Center recently opened its doors, and to the Ecuadorian capital Quito, where his tree-covered Qorner Tower will do so later this year. Covid-19 eased the architect\u2019s unrelenting travel schedule, but he used the downtime to pen a memoir, \u201cIf Walls Could Speak: My Life in Architecture.\u201d He said he felt it was \u201ctime to document things.\u201d  Published this week, \u201cIf Walls Could Speak\u201d serves as a reminder that much of Safdie\u2019s six-decade career has been dedicated to humbler pursuits \u2013 museums, memorials and social housing that reimagined how people might live in densely populated cities.  Before Marina Bay Sands, his best-known project was his very first: Habitat 67, a radical 1960s housing development that saw hundreds of identical prefabricated concrete units stacked into clusters along Montreal\u2019s Saint Lawrence River. Safdie\u2019s dream that it would spark a wave of large-scale \u201cHabitats\u201d around the world proved overly optimistic. His attempts to repeat the feat in other cities, including New York, Toronto and Iran\u2019s capital Tehran, have often been thwarted. Projects of such size require land, funding and political will, and Safdie\u2019s book openly recounts times when all three were lacking. But the principles underpinning the experiment \u2013 that apartment dwellers should enjoy access to outdoor space, views in multiple directions and the opportunity to interact with nature and neighbors \u2013 defined his work thereafter. Born in 1938 in Haifa, then part of British-controlled Palestine, Safdie has credited much of this architectural ethos to his childhood. As a boy, he always lived in apartment buildings, first in a Bauhaus-style block on Haifa\u2019s Mount Carmel and then at his family\u2019s new home further up the hill. At the latter, he would enter via a bridge, while the famous Baha\u2019i Gardens \u201calmost functioned as my backyard,\u201d he writes in \u201cIf Walls Could Speak.\u201d One need not look far for the inspiration behind the skybridges and elevated urban gardens that have since characterized his oeuvre. Safdie moved to Canada with his parents aged 15. (In a neat turn of events, he departed Israel via Lod Airport, since renamed Ben Gurion Airport, where decades later he would design a terminal building.) It was in Montreal that Safdie decided to pursue architecture \u2013 and where he first grew his signature mustache. He attended the city\u2019s McGill University and wrote a college thesis, \u201cA Case for City Living,\u201d outlining his vision for a flexible housing \u201csystem\u201d that could be adapted to different contexts and climates. Those early ideas have long shaped Safdie\u2019s outlook. They would shape his fortunes, too. After showing his college drawings to the influential modernist Louis Kahn, he secured an apprenticeship at the architect\u2019s Philadelphia office. Soon after, he was offered the chance to put his ideas into practice at a scale unimaginable to most young graduates.  Montreal was due to host the 1967 World Fair, or Expo 67. Despite having never completed a building, the then 24-year-old Safdie was asked by the event\u2019s mastermind (and his thesis adviser), architect Sandy van Ginkel, to develop a master plan for the site. He was also tasked with building on his ideas, eventually proposing a village-sized development of some 1,200 prefabricated dwellings stacked 20 to 30 stories high. His meticulous placement of each factory-built module was calculated to maximize garden space, allow in sunlight and improve residents\u2019 views. Interconnected pedestrian walkways and bridges lifted the urban realm above ground.  Political and financial realities scaled back his design; the final Habitat 67 comprised just 154 apartments \u2013 made from 354 modules and stacked 12 stories high across three \u201cclusters.\u201d It was, nonetheless, a major statement. In a postwar world rethinking how to accommodate rapidly urbanizing populations, Safdie\u2019s system of repeated modular forms offered a bold new model for housing. Three of the 20th century\u2019s most important architects, I.M. Pei, Paul Rudolph and Philip Johnson, toured the project together prior to its opening. Only when Johnson told Safdie that he had \u201coutdone\u201d the classical Italian architect Giovanni Battista Piranesi did he realize the project \u201cwas a game changer,\u201d he recounted. Habitat 67 was not universally adored. A New Yorker cartoon, which Safdie also displays at his Boston office, poked \u201cgentle fun\u201d at the project by depicting a spade-wielding child stacking sand into similar formations. Various journalists and fellow architects were more barbed in their criticisms.  \u201cIt\u2019s strange that something so radical done by a young person gets so much crap thrown at it,\u201d Safdie mused. \u201cBut that\u2019s been true of my career.\u201d   \u2018For everyone a garden\u2019  To define Safdie\u2019s career by either his breakout success or the \u201cmegascale\u201d projects of recent years would be to ignore much else in between.  In the early 1970s, he opened an office in Jerusalem, a city whose urban fabric he has profoundly transformed. As well as designing major institutions like the Hebrew Union College and the Yad Vashem Holocaust History Museum, he oversaw a full-scale rebuild of the destroyed Jewish Quarter and planned an entirely new city, Modi\u2019in-Maccabim-Re\u2019ut, about 15 miles to its northwest. At one point, he even considered running for mayor of Jerusalem. He has also built widely in North America, where his output spans from the meditative (a nondenominational chapel at the Harvard Business School) to the mammoth (Terminal 1 of Toronto\u2019s Pearson Airport). A citizen of Israel, the US and Canada, Safdie may be best known in the latter for the National Gallery in Ottawa, a grand glass palace housing some of the country\u2019s most treasured art.  Despite earlier setbacks Safdie has, more recently, found fertile ground for his \u201cHabitats\u201d in Asia. In 2017, he completed the first phase of the sprawling Habitat Qinhuangdao \u2013 in the titular city, about 200 miles from Beijing \u2013 a series of 16-story \u201cmini blocks\u201d connected by garden bridges. Back in Singapore, Safdie\u2019s pixelated Sky Habitat tower saw him stretch his familiar stacked forms high above the ground to maximize floor space on a comparatively small plot. In both cases \u2013 and throughout Safdie\u2019s career \u2013 ideals articulated in the 1960s have been adapted to meet the realities of new sites and clients. Yet, the architect maintains that his approach to housing remains, fundamentally, the same. \u201cThe belief in apartments being rethought as houses, in having gardens for every apartment, in quality of life, in streets and communities and making buildings that belong to their culture \u2013 from the outset these were fundamental to my beliefs,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they haven\u2019t changed. If anything, they have reinforced themselves as years go by.\u201d \u201cI think, without bragging, there\u2019s been consistency,\u201d he added. \u201cIn fact, you could say I\u2019ve not been dynamic enough, but I\u2019ve been pretty consistent.\u201d  Idealism and compromise   There were other high-profile proposals that never came to fruition. Among the most divisive was the Columbus Center, a pair of heavy-set towers once set to loom over Manhattan\u2019s Central Park at Columbus Circle before plans were scrapped following 1987\u2019s Wall Street crash (and amid vociferous criticism from the likes of Henry Kissinger and Jacqueline Onassis).  But Safdie\u2019s legacy will not be measured only by what was, or wasn\u2019t, built. Many of the once-radical ideas he championed are now mainstream \u2013 something he can take an amount of credit for. For one, his fixation on plant life, a principle he dubbed \u201cfor everyone a garden\u201d in a 1974 book of the same name, is now widely shared by younger architects. Urban gardens and \u201cliving walls\u201d are now almost de rigueur for new large-scale developments.  Plants do not always thrive, though. In his memoir, Safdie distinguishes between \u201csignificant plant life\u201d and \u201csorry shrubs.\u201d So-called biophilic architecture may now be all the rage, but it can be undone by insufficient planning or maintenance, leaving occupants with dying trees and even bug infestations. As such, Safdie welcomes the trend while cautioning again token gestures. \u201cThe idea of green buildings is a battle cry \u2013 everyone is for it,\u201d he said. Making them work, however, is another matter altogether. \u201cThere\u2019s a cynicism about so many architects presenting buildings that are fairly conventional and then, in the renderings, everything is green and every balcony is oozing with trees. When you look (closer), you see there\u2019s no preparation for the earth, there\u2019s no depth \u2013 it\u2019s a fantasy.\u201d Prefabrication, championed by the architect since his college thesis, is also enjoying a renaissance. Just two miles away from Marina Bay Sands, for instance, a Singaporean design firm is overseeing two 630-foot-tall residential skyscrapers built from units constructed in a factory over the border in Malaysia.  \u201cFor a long time, people totally gave up on (prefabrication),\u201d Safdie said. \u201cBut now there is a real shortage of labor and skilled labor \u2013 not in China, because they\u2019ve got an extraordinary workforce, and not in India, but everywhere else in Southeast Asia, in Singapore, in the West. So, anything that is labor-saving is now up for grabs.\u201d Much else has changed since Safdie formed his architectural ideals. For one, he \u201cnever would have imagined\u201d how densely populated cities would become in the past 50 years. \u201cPrograms change, lifestyles change, priorities change and technologies change,\u201d the architect added.  But what about him? Has his outlook changed, too? \u201cMy daughter accused me of not being as idealistic as I was,\u201d the architect said. \u201cI disagree with her.\u201d Safdie is nonetheless aware that the lofty principles of his youth may not be shared by the casinos or corporate clients he often works for. Being an architect sometimes means serving \u201cregimes you\u2019re not in love with and business entities whose values are different to yours,\u201d he noted.  \u201cTake the dilemma I had with Marina Bay Sands,\u201d he said, motioning once more toward the window and our view of the complex from the Ritz-Carlton\u2019s lounge. \u201cOn the one hand, the idea of doing a building that could promote \u2018gaming\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s a nice word for it, but \u2018gambling\u2019 is the reality \u2013 is almost immoral if you go there and see poor people with limited means wasting their money.  \u201cBut, to me, that was 2% or 3% of the area of a project that\u2026 could show what the public realm could be in a city. And that took over from the issue that nagged me.  \u201cThat\u2019s compromise,\u201d he concluded. \u201cBut the basic value, the idealism of the end product, has not diminished.

{"id": "2024_05_27_style_on-becoming-a-guinea-fowl-cannes-rungano-nyoni-interview-spc", "text": "The final, searing shot of Rungano Nyoni\u2019s \u201cOn Becoming a Guinea Fowl\u201d is a convergence of everything that\u2019s come before. The film, about a sudden death and family secrets in Zambia, comes to a thundering conclusion in a shouting match that threatens to drown out all empathy. Trauma, misogyny and Kafkaesque logic combine in a toxic brew that\u2019s difficult to stomach, for us as well as its main character. For a film that has remained even-tempered in its study of family values \u00ad\u2013 and the groupthink family can foster \u2013 finally, its pulse quickens. You realize that rage, that had felt disquietingly absent before, was there all along. Nyoni\u2019s first movie \u201cI Am Not A Witch\u201d broke through at the Cannes Film Festival in 2017 and won her a BAFTA. The Zambian British filmmaker returned to the festival with another acerbic work, this time with heavyweight backing in the form of US distributor A24 (\u201cEverything Everywhere All At Once,\u201d \u201cThe Zone of Interest\u201d) and producer Element Pictures (\u201cPoor Things\u201d), winning the award for best director in the Un Certain Regard competition on May 24. Like her debut, a satire on the practice of witch camps, also set in Zambia, the country of Nyoni\u2019s birth, \u201cGuinea Fowl\u201d deals with injustice in tragicomic fashion. This time the writer-director\u2019s target is historic abuse, and what happens when the perpetrator can\u2019t or won\u2019t be held accountable. The idea came from a scrapped plotline for Nyoni\u2019s previous film, she told CNN, in an interview during the festival. She revived it through intensive research, interviewing survivors in Zambia for her Bemba and English-language screenplay. \u201cWhat I found quite remarkable was how casual people are about sexual abuse,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes everybody knows the perpetrator and sits at the (same) dinner table. How do you cope with that? How do you cope with somebody, that everybody knows they do that, and then ask them to pass the salt? It\u2019s bizarre to me. How do you not get up and just set everything on fire?\u201d That most people don\u2019t is the thread Nyoni wanted to pull at. \u201cThe difficulty of speaking up and the submissiveness you experience in that silence,\u201d she said, is \u201can ongoing subject\u201d in her filmmaking. Her sophomore feature concerns Shula (Susan Chardy), a middle-class Zambian who has recently returned from a life abroad. One night, on the way back from a fancy dress party, she discovers her uncle dead by the roadside. She reports this to her father only to be met with the first of a series of bizarre responses to the news. \u201cUncle Fred can\u2019t die. Just sprinkle some water on him,\u201d she\u2019s told. Her father is right, albeit for the wrong reasons: Uncle Fred has been living in Shula\u2019s head ever since he abused her as a child. She\u2019s not the only survivor in the family, we learn, nor was any of this much of a secret. Nevertheless, there\u2019s a funeral to be arranged, public displays of mourning to wail through, and a lot of history to be swept under the carpet. Spiking her drama with surreal images and poetic flourishes, Nyoni sends audiences through the looking glass, then pulls them back with pitch black humor, asking us to question whether what we\u2019re watching is all that absurd in the first place. \u201cYou don\u2019t even look traumatized,\u201d one affronted aunty tells Shula in the aftermath of Fred\u2019s discovery. Later at a gathering of mourners, another aunty instructs her to \u201ccry a bit.\u201d \u201cWhy are you so cold hearted?\u201d she adds, \u201cYou\u2019re embarrassing us.\u201d Nyoni sees her film as corrective to how abuse is often depicted. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you see in a lot of movies,\u201d she explains, \u201c(where) you say your secret, and everyone comes around you. From my experience \u2013 and from what I saw from other people \u2013 sometimes that doesn\u2019t happen. Then how do you live with that?\u201d \u201cGuinea Fowl\u201d zeroes in on a bitter irony: the same conspiracy of silence that is breaking apart individuals is also holding the family together. Deference and duty remain paramount, and to the mourners who descend on the family home to pay their respects, everyone appears outwardly functional. (That this is happening in a matriarchal society, where men are largely side-lined, makes it even more confounding.) \u201cI know quite well about keeping secrets,\u201d said the writer-director, cryptically. Of the film\u2019s family dynamics, \u201cI know this subject,\u201d she elaborated, \u201cbut this is definitely a fictionalized version of whatever it is I\u2019ve experienced.\u201d Faced with a family omerta and a dead perpetrator, there\u2019s nowhere for Shula to place her anger. \u201cYou can\u2019t question a corpse,\u201d her father says, imploring her to let bygones be bygones. It\u2019s taboo to speak ill of the dead. But as memories continue to hemorrhage through, her reaction to her abuser\u2019s death poses questions of his enablers. In her feature debut, Chardy rises to the challenge of playing Shula. \u201cI empathize with her a lot,\u201d said the actor. \u201cAs a person I have a lot to say, and to find this medium where you\u2019re trying to say something without saying something, it\u2019s a push and pull between feeling powerless and powerful at the same time.\u201d The writer-director also sees some of herself in her lead. \u201cI have this rage,\u201d Nyoni said. \u201cYou can see it, but maybe it\u2019s more subtle, it\u2019s somehow repressed.\u201d Screenwriting is \u201calways a reflection of what I\u2019m going through,\u201d she added, \u201cI try not to get in the way of that.\u201d Shula is not the only perspective the director was interested in, however. Nyoni increasingly folds in the narrative of Fred\u2019s young widow (played by Norah Mwansa) \u2013 a victim herself, further victimized by his death. \u201cThe widow I struggled with, so we found people who\u2019ve been in the same situation,\u201d Nyoni said. \u201cThey were very candid, and told me about their stories and were really open.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got worse stories to tell about what happens (than what appears in the film),\u201d she added. \u201cWidows end up being a scapegoat for a lot of people\u2019s frustrations.\u201d In its final act, \u201cGuinea Fowl\u201d shows how difficult it can be to truly break the cycle of abuse. Yet Nyoni\u2019s complicated portrait of family trauma is not without hope, thanks to Shula and a last gasp moment full of sound and fury, signifying everything. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s the most powerful shot in the film,\u201d said Chardy. \u201cIt\u2019s bigger than \u2018(Shula) finds strength;\u2019 she owns what happened to her and wants to take everybody else with her.\u201d Chardy hopes the film\u2019s sense of resolve will resonate. \u201cThere are a lot more women in the world who have gone through this, and you really don\u2019t know until you speak to someone,\u201d she added. \u201cI hope that (audiences) will be able to find some strength from the journey that Shula finds herself on.\u201d \u201cOn Becoming A Guinea Fowl\u201d premiered at the Cannes Film Festival and is coming soon to theaters in the US and UK.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/style/on-becoming-a-guinea-fowl-cannes-rungano-nyoni-interview-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_03_19_style_big-biba-london-1960s-store-history", "text": "\u201cMy God, it\u2019s dull,\u201d said interior designer Steven Thomas of the British retail landscape in 2024. As the creative force behind the look of the wildly popular 1970s London fashion store Big Biba, Thomas knows a thing or two about engineering excitement. Big Biba \u2014 a daring, 20,000 square foot destination by fashion illustrator Barbara Hulanicki and her former marketing executive husband, Stephen Fitz-Simon \u2014 was conceived with a level of detail usually reserved for high-end concept stores.\u00a0Opened in September 1973,\u00a0it was the\u00a0fourth and final outpost of the-then iconic brand.\u00a0The\u00a0seven-floor Art Deco emporium on London\u2019s fashionable Kensington High Street featured\u00a0a soup stand inspired by Andy Warhol, a roof garden featuring real flamingos and penguins, and a much-lauded celebrity hotspot the \u201cRainbow Room\u201d. \u201cBecause the Rainbow Room looked the way it did, it didn\u2019t take long for the glitterati to latch on; it was very much a place to be seen dining,\u201d recalled Thomas in an interview with CNN. Originally designed by architect Marcel Hennequet in 1933 and named after its multi-colored ceiling (the dining room was otherwise all white tablecloths and fake plants), it \u201cbecame a venue of choice,\u201d he suggested. \u201cDavid Bowie, Mick Jagger, Bryan Ferry all dropped in.\u201d \u201cFitz employed the son of a friend who had an extraordinary knack of picking people up, like Ian Dury and the Blockheads,\u201d continued Thomas, recalling the unofficial booker. \u201cHe got the New York Dolls to play when they came over, another coup. They did a vandalizing tour of the first floor, shoplifting all the women\u2019s clothes.\u201d These stories and more are all explored in \u201cWelcome to Big Biba,\u201d Thomas\u2019s gold-fronted monograph of the venture republished this month by ACC Art Books to celebrate the brand\u2019s 60th anniversary. \u201cThis book is a testament to creative freedom,\u201d writes the now 87-year-old Hulanicki in the foreword, reflecting on her legacy. \u201cYou can do it all as long as you learn to wear a suit. Of course, your secret will be that the suit is lined in gold lam\u00e9.\u201d Making fashion democratic The Biba story began in May 1964 when Hulanicki and Fitz-Simon began running \u201cBiba\u2019s Postal Boutique,\u201d a mail-order store selling limited runs of stock. Singer Annie Lennox described the venture as having led \u201cthe way for those of us living in provincial places where we felt we were dying of drabness.\u201d Inspired by decadent styles from bygone times \u2014 albeit with drastically shortened hemlines \u2014 in earthy or muted colors such as olive, rust and \u201cbruised purple,\u201d Biba\u2019s wares certainly struck a chord with young female shoppers, and the brand rode the wave of what Thomas described as \u201cthe first burst of teenage energy and finance availability.\u201d \u201cBiba made fashion democratic,\u201d explained Martin Pel, author of \u201cThe Biba Years 1963-1975\u201d and curator of a new exhibition at London\u2019s Fashion & Textile Museum, in an email. \u201cThis expression is often overused of designers in the 1960s, particularly Mary Quant. Quant\u2019s clothes whilst youthful, were expensive. Biba was inexpensive, well designed, good quality, and up-to-the-minute.\u201d By September 1964, Hulanicki and Fitz-Simon had opened their first brick and mortar store in a former drugstore, twice moving the business into bigger premises throughout the 60s. In 1966 the brand\u2019s second shop on Kensington Church Street \u2014 where Vogue editor Anna Wintour famously did a stint as a Saturday girl \u2014 was described by Vanity Fair magazine as \u201cthe most exotic shop in London.\u201d and in the early 1970s, a boutique launched in New York\u2019s Bergdorf Goodman department store. \u201cAn act of bravery\u201d Interior designer Thomas had already designed Hulanicki and Fitz-Simon\u2019s home and the third Biba store in 1968 before being approached about the landmark seven-level store. \u201cFitz offered me two floors (of Big Biba) but I wanted it all,\u201d he recalled of his initial involvement. \u201cA moment of complete lunacy, considering Tim (Whitmore, his creative partner) and I were ex-painting students working out of my bedroom. It was an extraordinary act of bravery on their part, giving us the contract, it wouldn\u2019t happen today.\u201d Stocking Big Biba\u2019s seven floors was equal parts intimidating and invigorating said Thomas, explaining that he and Whitmore worked closely with Hulanicki throughout. \u201cBiba was always a reflection of Barbara\u2019s life,\u201d he noted, \u201cso because Barbara had a kid, of course we had a kid\u2019s floor,\u201d with d\u00e9cor inspired by Disney World, a carousel ride and miniature cottage kids caf\u00e9 with toadstool seating. On Saturdays, an actor would visit and read stories and a cr\u00e8che \u2014 a revolutionary concept in fashion retail now, let alone 50 years ago \u2014 allowed parents freedom to explore the other floors. A maternity section and a space for 11-13 year old\u2019s were similarly modern for the time, likewise the introduction of communal changing rooms \u2014 although true to the spirit of the times, many clients reportedly changed in the middle of the store itself. Elsewhere menswear took over the third floor, complete with a \u201cmistress\u201d section for purchasing more sensual items with discretion. Biba-branded household items were upstairs. While each floor took on its own theme (maternity for example was fitted with comedic outsized furniture, inspired by Ken Russell\u2019s 1971 musical comedy \u201cThe Boyfriend\u201d), much of the store was furnished in Biba\u2019s distinctive black and gold colorway, with mirrored fixtures, ostrich feathers and leopard print features. While Wintour\u2019s shopgirl life was short-lived, Big Biba\u2019s staff were a vital component of the experience remembered Thomas. \u201cThey loved working there, it was their club,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if a (customer) bought a Biba poster and stuck it on her wall, she felt part of the club. It was the theater of retail really.\u201d It was an unmitigated success. When the store opened its legendary roof gardens in 1974, they were ushered in by a party described in the British press as \u201clike walking into a film set of rather jolly moral depravity.\u201d Shoppers from all over the country, and even internationally, convened at the store to buy into the zeitgeist. According to Hulanicki, during its two-year run, Big Biba was the number two tourist attraction in the British capital after the Tower of London, with Buckingham Palace being number three. But Biba\u2019s success was short-lived. In 1969, the independent company sold a majority of its shares to another British fashion retailer Dorothy Perkins which, in August 1973 (a month before Big Biba opened), was then bought by a property development company called British Land. The high cost of keeping the store open and the faltering British economy of the mid-70s meant the new owners closed the store\u2019s third and fourth floors in March 1975, and the rest of the store followed that September against the backdrop of a nationwide property slump. Six decades on however, Biba\u2019s legacy outlasts its footprint on the high street. Its low-cost yet well-made clothing is still coveted today, with heirloom designs sometimes retailing for hundreds of dollars. As Pel noted, \u201ctoday Biba clothes stand as a lesson to both consumers and retailers that inexpensive fashion does not have to be disposable.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/style/big-biba-london-1960s-store-history/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_style_new-chinese-style-gen-z-intl-hnk", "text": "What\u2019s old is new again. This time it\u2019s a centuries-old skirt design that\u2019s proving popular in China. The \u201cmamianqun\u201d or \u201chorse face skirt\u201d is being worn in cities like Shanghai, Beijing and Chengdu as young people in China are giving the attire a modern twist, with unconventional pairings and choice of fabrics. While once the sole purview of \u201chanfu\u201d enthusiasts (a renaissance of the ancient clothing traditionally worn by ethnic-majority Han Chinese before the Qing dynasty) and reserved for special occasions, the pleated often brocade skirts have become a part of everyday wear. The popularity of the skirt has been wrapped into a broader trend being dubbed \u201cxinzhongshi,\u201d or \u201cnew Chinese style\u201d \u2014 which merges all manner of contemporary design with traditional Chinese aesthetics, applied to everything from clothing to furniture. While the idea isn\u2019t new, and was once considered old-fashioned, the wide-ranging term is being used as a marketing tool on China\u2019s lucrative e-commerce platforms, with retailers quick to turn Gen Z\u2019s patriotic, and at times, nationalistic sentiments, for profit. On Chinese social media platforms Weibo and Xiaohongshu, searches for \u201cnew Chinese style\u201d and \u201cnew Chinese style outfits\u201d hashtags exceeded 100 million in early April, according to state news agency Xinhua. Besides fashion, the posts show everything from stuffed leather armchairs with the curves of traditional Chinese wood furniture to mobile phone wallpapers of landscape paintings. The state-backed China National Textile and Apparel Council estimates the market size of \u201cnew Chinese style\u201d clothing reached 1 billion yuan (nearly 138 million dollars) in 2023. On Xiaohongshu, a 33-year-old user, who goes by the handle Momo and didn\u2019t give her real name for privacy reasons, frequently gives tips on how to style Chinese clothing. In one post, she demonstrated how you can top an oversized pink sweatshirt with a black mamianqun, pairing it with a matching baseball cap and sneakers. \u201cMore and more young people are willing to use traditional culture as a new way to express their attitudes. That\u2019s a good thing and very cool,\u201d she told CNN in a text message. It\u2019s mostly young people following the trend, agrees Huang Weizhe, a 32-year-old designer and manager of local fashion brand Longfuji. On social media, Huang shares ways to dress in \u201cnew Chinese style,\u201d and in one post wears a loose silk shirt with jeans. \u201cThere is no set rule in the \u2018new Chinese style\u2019 (trend) that you must follow, so it is more inclusive. This is the style that young people like now,\u201d he told CNN over the phone. Riding the \u2018new\u2019 Chinese style wave Fashion designers like Samuel Gui Yang, whose collections have long taken inspiration from Chinese heritage, are seeing more interest from mainland China turn to their brands due to the \u201cnew Chinese style\u201d trend. But unlike the mamianqun, which is a literal nod to the past \u2013 and being mass produced \u2013 his 9-year-old brand has been about bridging the gap \u201cbetween Shanghai and London\u201d and drawing from the rich tapestry of what it means to be Chinese, in China and abroad. \u201cI think my wider audience (is) really a fan of\u2026the way we bring in this \u2018Chineseness\u2019 (the) heritage details in a more subtle way,\u201d he said in a phone interview. For Yang, the aesthetics and themes of Taiwanese filmmaker Ang Lee\u2019s 1994 movie \u201cEat Drink Man Woman\u201d represent his idea of what \u201cnew Chinese style\u201d should be. The film about the lives of a master chef and his three daughters navigating the tensions between modernity and traditions, personal freedom and family. Yang said, \u201csubtly reflects the lifestyle of Chinese people, especially the direct connection between a dinner table and interpersonal relationships.\u201d The film, he added, \u201cprovides us with a lot of inspiration for our design journey,\u201d and that he always draws from the \u201c80s and 90s Asian dressing style.\u201d There\u2019s the Lee denim jacket inspired by Hong Kong martial arts and film star Bruce Lee and the Ailing dress, named after Shanghai-born American novelist Eileen Chang. At Shanghai Fashion Week this March, he showcased a long-sleeved bias cut qipao with roll-up sleeves (pictured top), giving the classic silhouette a fresh update. For Ian Hylton, designer and decades-long China resident, \u201cnew Chinese style\u201d is a misnomer. His eponymous menswear label draws heavily on Chinese dress styles and design motifs \u2013 think elegant loose silk mandarin collar shirts, Tang puffer jackets and cashmere coats with button knots. \u201cI\u2019m kind of not a fan of this term \u2018new Chinese style,\u2019 because to me that\u2019s like saying new French clothes, new Italian clothes,\u201d Hylton told CNN over the phone. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing new. There\u2019s a new way to approach it, but it\u2019s somehow being treated like a trend, like short or long skirts. They\u2019re part of a culture, they\u2019re the fabric and makeup of a culture.\u201d Hylton\u2019s wife, Min Liu, launched her own Chinese-aesthetics inspired label Ms. Min in 2010, a reaction, he said, to the fact that most people in the country weren\u2019t wearing Chinese clothes. Hylton is the company\u2019s president. \u201cWhen I arrived in China\u2026there was not a billboard, there was not an advertisement, there was not an anything that featured a Chinese person,\u201d said Hylton, who moved to China in 2005 as the creative director of luxury fashion label Ports 1961. \u201cEverything was a foreign face\u2026everything that was foreign was good and everything that was local was disrespected.\u201d The tides he believes have turned in the last decade or so with young Chinese becoming more aware and confident of their place in the world, and embracing China\u2019s culture and history. Domestic fashion labels also saw a boost during the pandemic, as strict travel restrictions prevented mainland Chinese from buying luxury goods abroad. Meanwhile Momo, the Xiaohongshu user, said the popularity of \u201cnew Chinese style\u201d has been down to \u201cserious commercialization,\u201d which she doesn\u2019t necessarily buy into. Douyin, China\u2019s TikTok released a report in March showing a 841% increase in the sale of the mamianqun skirts that typically retail for around 200 yuan (roughly US$28), on its e-commerce platform compared to the year before. State broadcaster CCTV reported that Cao county in Shandong province, which it said accounts for around half of the country\u2019s mamianqun production, sold 550 million yuan (almost $76 million) worth of skirts in the first two months of the year, a surge attributed to the run-up of the Lunar New Year holiday. But some of the \u201cnew Chinese style\u201d products are \u201cshoddily made\u201d she said, though she thinks that their designs will improve with time. Regardless of trends, Momo said she will continue to teach her 33,000 followers how to wear traditional clothing as much as possible \u2013 out and about, to study and to work. \u201cWhenever we wear \u2018new Chinese style\u2019 or hanfu and mamianqun, it\u2019s a way we can invite more people, including those around the world, to understand (our) culture.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/style/new-chinese-style-gen-z-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_04_16_style_copenhagen-old-stock-exchange-fire-intl", "text": "A huge fire has engulfed Copenhagen\u2019s old stock exchange, one of the Danish capital\u2019s most famous landmarks, causing its spire to collapse as staff and citizens scrambled to rescue paintings and historic artefacts from the blaze. \u201cI cannot describe how upset I and my colleagues are,\u201d said a visibly moved Brian Mikkelsen, CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce, which owns and has offices in the 17th century building. \u201cIt is a huge disaster, because it is 400 years of cultural history that is in flames.\u201d Stunned commuters and onlookers watched as the raging fire could be seen swirling around the building\u2019s distinctive 56-meter spire - shaped as the tail of four entwined dragons - moments before it collapsed and fell into the street below. Some passersby even joined emergency services to run inside the burning building and help carry large Renaissance paintings and other objects away from the blaze. Among the paintings saved was Danish artist Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s 1895 work \u201cFrom the Copenhagen Stock Exchange,\u201d the Chamber of Commerce said. Denmark\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, called the fire \u201cour own Notre Dame moment,\u201d referring to the blaze that destroyed the roof and spire of the Paris cathedral, five years ago almost to the day. The fire began at around 8.30 a.m. local time (2.30 a.m. ET), a Copenhagen fire department chief told CNN, and by 11 a.m. nearly half of the building had been destroyed. The fire was still burning by late afternoon. The Chamber of Commerce said it is \u201cat a loss for words for how great a tragedy this is.\u201d It said it was \u201ca sad day for our country\u201d and that \u201cthe damage will unfortunately be very expensive.\u201d \u201cWe have tried to rescue a lot of historic paintings that were inside the building and the historic furniture,\u201d Jakob Vedsted Andersen, an executive director at the Greater Copenhagen fire and rescue service, told CNN. He said it was \u201cway too soon\u201d to speculate about the causes of the blaze. Copenhagen police have told people to avoid the area and there have been no reported injuries so far. People were in the building when the fire started but they were all evacuated, said a police spokesperson who added that military personnel were at the scene to support fire-fighting efforts. A \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d is on fire, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said, calling the building\u2019s cultural heritage \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d The B\u00f8rsen building has been at the heart of Danish business since the 17th century. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt said 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he added in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Emergency services were working to control the fire but it had spread to all floors through the elevator shaft. Frank Trier Mikkelsen, operations manager at the Greater Copenhagen fire department, said the fire is burning \u201cviolently\u201d inside the building, according to TV 2, a government-owned TV channel. Forty firefighters were inside the building, with valuables being rescued, TV 2 reported. Mikkelsen told the Danish broadcaster that the fire is of a type that emergency managers dread, explaining parts of the building\u2019s roof need to be removed to extinguish it. He added machines have been called in to remove some of the copper roof, as the water just bounces off it.

{"id": "2024_06_25_style_highlights-menswear-shows-paris-fashion-week", "text": "Paris may be readying itself for the Summer Olympics, but sporting events are not the only buzzy affairs taking place in the French capital. This past week, fashion designers converged in the city for Paris Fashion Week Spring-Summer 2025 menswear collections \u2014 but nothing was business as usual. Both the menswear shows and the couture shows (now in full swing) were moved up a week to avoid interfering with sport\u2019s most celebrated event, and simmering political tensions ahead of the country\u2019s surprise snap election, called by President Emmanuel Macron, have filled the streets with near daily protests in the past few weeks. In this climate, there was no shortage of political commentary on the menswear runways, but perhaps the loudest by the American designers showing in the city. At Rick Owens\u2019 grandiose show at the Palais de Tokyo, which featured a near-all white collection mixing biblical references and Art Deco, he sent out a diverse cast of models whom he called his \u201cWhite Satin Army of Love\u201d and urged solidarity with one another. \u201cExpressing our individuality is great but sometimes expressing our unity and reliance on each other is a good thing to remember too\u2026 especially in the face of the peak intolerance we are experiencing in the world right now,\u201d he wrote in the show notes. Rapper A$AP Rocky, too, made a statement for his Paris Fashion Week debut \u2014 a secret show for his label AWGE, which launched earlier this year. Calling the presentation \u201cAmerican Sabotage,\u201d it was hosted in Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s former home, the 18th-century mansion H\u00f4tel de Maisons, and attended, of course, by\u00a0Rihanna, as well as Pusha T, Casey Affleck, and designers Jonathan Anderson and Willy Chavarria. Guests were greeted with invitations bearing an antiwar sign and cakes resembling guns and cocaine bags, for an air of dystopia. On the runway, models marched with their heads covered by American eagle flags, wore slogans like \u201cDon\u2019t be Dumb\u201d and carried plastic bags filled with cash. In the show notes, the rapper declared that his label is \u201cmore than just a brand\u2014it\u2019s a movement.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re wrecking boundaries and making statements through every piece, reflecting the spirit and resilience of our communities. This is fashion with purpose, where art meets activism,\u201d he explained. For his fourth showing with Louis Vuitton, Pharrell also played up military symbols, combining camouflage and damier \u2014 the luxury house\u2019s signature checkerboard \u2014 into \u201cdamoflage.\u201d The show, hosted at UNESCO headquarters, featured cartography graphics and military berets, and pointed to travel, aviation, international diplomacy and a creative dialogue \u2014 notably through collaborating with the creative collective Air Afrique on graphics. And then there was KidSuper, another majestic show with giant marionette hands to which the models staggered out like puppets. Designer Colm Dillane wanted to \u201cexplore interconnectedness and the unseen forces shaping our world,\u201d he wrote in show notes, inviting the audience to \u201creflect on autonomy\u201d and the narratives we each construct for ourselves. Subcultures as craft Elsewhere on the runways, designers brought subculture styles to the fore. German magazine 032C showed something akin to techno couture, which bridged a party-to-office lifestyle. Minimalist and functional, clothes spanned neon orange workwear to faux vintage sportswear to chokers and XXL cargo pants, all reminiscent of Berlin\u2019s legendary nightlife style. Junya Watanabe, meanwhile, presented a mix of tartan and heavy metal with reworked ACDC, Skorpions and Black Sabbath t-shirts onto a tailored wardrobe; and Doublet mixed club-kid aesthetics with suiting and graffitied tops. Models carried gold and silver pom poms \u2014 some as props, others as clutches \u2014 adding an unexpected accessory to both casual and more formal looks. And of course there was queer fashion label Jeanne Friot, with feather-adorned denim pants and belt bandeau skirts for all genders, entirely crafted out of deadstock. The designer wants to offer a wider range of expressions for men. \u201cFor me, punk today means\u2026 doing things locally, responsibly\u2026 just as much as addressing gender norms,\u201d Friot explained in an interview following the show. Pretty boys Across the menswear shows, other designers joined Friot in redefining what menswear looks like. Storied luxury house Comme des Gar\u00e7ons played with bright fuchsia tailoring and skirt pants, blending former gender distinctions. The layered maximalist collection featured ruffles, giant lapels and tulle, evoking the elaborate and delicate court attire of France\u2019s former monarchy rather than functional fashion. Japanese brand Sacai, meanwhile,\u00a0brought experimental couture to everyday clothes with a collection that focused on the joy and freedom of discovery, offering up\u00a0skirts-shorts, layered suits and giant bouffant sleeves.\u00a0The label Taakk also offered romantic lines, sheer shirts, floral motifs and a sense of delicacy, with candy-coloured silk and satin, as well as coiled pin curls worn by models. Last but not least, Etudes Studio centered its work on what artists might need, quoting Andy Warhol and notably Jean-Michel Basquiat as an inspiration for his \u201claid-back, nonchalant\u201d sense of elegance, as the trio of designers \u2014 J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Egry, Aur\u00e9lien Arnet and Jos\u00e9 Lamali \u2014 described backstage. Dries bids goodbye Belgian designer Dries Van Noten presented his final \u2014 and 150th \u2014 collection, stepping down from his role as of his eponymous brand after 38 years. Shown on a runway made of silver foil, the shimmery, delicate pieces were not a \u201cbest-of\u201d or a retrospective, but a final collection that will no doubt sell. The show received a standing ovation as\u00a0Donna Summer\u2019s \u201cI Feel Love\u201d set the ebullient mood. A giant disco ball appeared at the end of the runway welcoming the guests to join the party \u2014 a celebration for Van Noten to take his final bow.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/style/highlights-menswear-shows-paris-fashion-week/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_style_milan-menswear-spring-summer-2025", "text": "There are few things more synonymous with Italy in spring and summer than its beaches. From the Adriatic to the Amalfi Coast, its colorful \u201clidos\u201d (private beach clubs) are one of the country\u2019s most iconic exports. The Italian contingent of the Milan Fashion Week schedule seemed set on paying homage to its sunny shores during a weekend of Spring-Summer 2025 shows where a reoccurring theme of backstage mood boards was Italy\u2019s beloved \u201cal mare\u201d (the sea). At MSGM, where designer Massimo Giorgetti celebrated his brand\u2019s 15th\u00a0anniversary, outfits riffed on beach-resort signatures with sun-dyed stripes, shiny swim shorts, and cutout motifs of crabs, mermaids and dolphins reminiscent of childhood toys lost in the sand. Giorgetti, originally from the beach city of Rimini \u2014 famed of its 15km stretch of umbrella-lined sands \u2014 instead used an image of his adopted seaside home, 300 miles away on the Ligurian coast\u00a0as the main motif in the collection, a place where, he said, he draws inspiration from the evocative \u201cpines, agaves, and the scent of salt and resin.\u201d Remembering the Grand Tour At Dolce & Gabbana, Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana naturally leaned into beaches frequented by the jet-set \u2014 the kind of people who arrive ashore by their yacht\u2019s tender \u2014 for its collection entitled \u201cItalian Beauty\u201d.\u00a0It was heavy on the raffia (seen on boxy jackets, shoes and satchels) and all-over coral embroidery that nodded to the twinkling keepsakes found in the \u2018goallerieas\u2019\u00a0\u00a0(jewelry stores) of Capri and Portofino that the Italians love to window-shop at sunset. \u201cSince the 19th century, the Grand Tour was a journey that had Italy as its destination, thus becoming one of the most iconic places to visit for summer holidays,\u201d relayed the designers\u00a0in show notes, adding that Italy\u2019s hotspots \u201cbecame places of pure aesthetics,\u201d a snapshot that they paid homage to with louche-cut silhouettes in luxe materials. Between the city and the beach At Gucci, where Sabato de Sarno revealed his sophomore menswear collection for the house, city-approved leather jackets and polo shirts mingled with icons of ocean culture. \u201cThis collection speaks of encounters \u2014 \u2018icontri\u2019 \u2014 between the city and the beach and among people who love life,\u201d said Napoli-born De Sarno. His sharp cuts were countered with a breezy sensibility reflected in repetitive dolphin and surfer prints that popped up on retro Cuban-collar shirts (the latter inspired by author William Finnegan\u2019s autobiography \u201cBarbarian Days, A Surfing Life\u201d). Elsewhere, toweling-style polo shirts in Neapolitan gelato shades were teamed with board shorts and rubber sea shoes \u2014 possibly de Sarno\u2019s first hype-item hit \u2014 which grounded the majority of looks. Despite what could have resulted in a presentation of derivative stereotypes, the Italians swerved gimmicks to deliver real clothes that have more to say than the popular but homogenized recent proliferation of \u201cquiet luxury\u201d collections. Against a divisive political and humanitarian backdrop, their homages to Italy\u2019s universally aspired-to dolce vita summers and throwbacks to what are now perceived as simpler times drew a collective optimism. Clothing that\u2019s both playful and useful Along similar lines, Prada looked to themes of youthful optimism, freedom and energy. For its collection, entitled \u201cCloser,\u201d the house looked to capture \u201cthe power of reality, in a world of the imaginary,\u201d\u00a0said the show notes, with closely cropped, deliberately creased shirting, off-kilter prismatic prints, and dropped-waist belts painted onto trousers in the style of tromp l\u2019oeil. Sweetly na\u00efve but at the same time reminding us that nothing is quite what meets the eye, it\u2019s easy to imagine this as a wardrobe that might find its way to the promenades of Rimini having been thrown in a hopeful ingenue\u2019s suitcase at the last minute for an invitation promising a good time. Miuccia Prada refuted it was a collection about escapism, \u201cactually, I propose something positive, I don\u2019t think we should escape from reality,\u201d she said backstage. Rather she and co-creative director Raf Simons wanted to create something \u201cplayful and useful\u201d chimed Simons. \u201cWe wanted to create clothes that have lived a life, that are alive in themselves,\u201d they relayed in the show notes. \u201cThere is a sense of spontaneity and optimism to these clothes \u2014 they reflect instinctive but deliberate choices, freedom.\u201d Celebrating a simple life The celebration of simple sensations and comfort in the familiar also popped up at JW Anderson, where designer Jonathan Anderson, who hails from Northern Ireland, sent summer knits depicting a child\u2019s drawing of quintessentially British \u201ctwo-up-two-down\u201d houses. At Moschino, where creative director Adrian Appiolaza debuted his first menswear collection, skirts came in postcard prints and blazers splashed with classic Italian tablescape scenes. \u201cEscaping the city, true individuals wear clothes that speak of the Italian countryside, of the wilds of\u00a0the jungle, and finally of a serenity \u2014 outer exploration, to find inner peace,\u201d said the brand. Fila+, headed up by Lev Tanju, staged a presentation that welcomed editors to a replica 1990s Italian home, with kids watching football in the living room, a nonna knitting a blanket in the Italian tricolor, and three men playing the card game Scopa around a kitchen table, all wearing tracksuits Tanju has reinvented from the 113-year-old Italian brand\u2019s illustrious archive. And at Fendi, Silvia Fendi based the collection on a picture of the Italian football manager wearing a Fendi suit that she found in the archive. A theme of reflective team spirit prevailed in sporty collegiate silhouettes featuring the Fendi crest comprising a squirrel, the Fendi stripe, and a Roman God. First used by previous creative director Karl Lagerfeld, it represents \u201cwho looks in two ways; one looks at the past and one looks at the future. And this is what Fendi is about, preserving techniques or but also experimenting,\u201d said Fendi backstage. Rooted in hopefulness\u00a0and experimentation, the Milan season was a collective celebration of dolce-vita.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/style/milan-menswear-spring-summer-2025/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}

Born to a Filipino mother and African American father, the 24-year-old\u2019s win was celebrated on social media as helping to \u201cshatter\u201d traditional beauty ideals long held in the country. \u201cChelsea\u2019s win challenges our ingrained preference for Eurocentric beauty (features) and lighter complexions in our nation,\u201d wrote one user in response to an Instagram post of the win on Miss Universe Philippines\u2019 official account. \u201cFilipino beauty standard shattered into pieces,\u201d read another. Representing Bulacan, a province to the north of Manila, Manalo beat out 52 other contestants from around the archipelago and overseas. The competition was held at the SM Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay. As the competition narrowed down to the top five finalists, Manalo was asked on stage how she would use her beauty and confidence to empower others. \u201cAs a woman of color, I have always faced challenges in my life. I was told that beauty has standards, actually,\u201d she said, adding that she was taught to \u201cbelieve in my mother, to always believe in yourself, uphold the vows that you have.\u201d \u201cBecause of these, I am already influencing a lot of women who are facing me right now,\u201d she said, gazing out to the packed arena. Manalo\u2019s win is part of a wider conversation about diversifying notions of beauty in the Philippines, a country where certain Western ideals have long persisted, shaped in part by the country\u2019s colonial past. Lighter-skinned actors and models typically star in major TV shows, movies and fashion campaigns and as common in other Asian countries, skin lightening treatments and products are pervasive. Manalo, who began modeling at 14, described her own insecurities growing up, in a YouTube video on Empire Philippines, which livestreamed the event. \u201cI grew up having insecurities as I was always bullied because of my skin and my hair type,\u201d she said, crediting her friends and family for helping her \u201crealize that I am beautiful in my own extraordinary way.\u201d Manalo will represent the Philippines in the Miss Universe pageant to be held in Mexico in September. She is vying to earn the fifth title for the country, following the footsteps of Gloria Diaz in 1969, Margie Moran in 1973, and Pia Wurtzbach in 2015 (after host Steve Harvey initially declared the wrong winner.) Catriona Gray was the last Filipino to win the title in 2018. Over 100 countries will be represented at Miss Universe 2024. This year will see the competition remove any upper age limit set for its contestants \u2014 previously, those competing were required to be between the age of 18 and 28. The Miss Universe organization has come under scrutiny in recent weeks, as the parent company of the Miss USA organization. Both Miss USA and Miss Teen USA resigned from their roles earlier this May, amid allegations of mismanagement, a toxic work environment, and conditions that impacted their mental health.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/style/chelsea-manalo-miss-universe-philippines-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_style_louis-vuitton-pietro-beccari-olympics", "text": "There are familiar sights synonymous with every Olympics and Paralympics \u2014 emotional athletes, jubilant crowds, stands filled with colorful flags. And at next month\u2019s upcoming Games, Louis Vuitton are hoping they too will become a hallmark of the same grand occasion. The luxury house\u2019s distinctive Damier checkerboard trunks will house the Olympic torch as it travels across France, and Vuitton has created medal cases for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Seven French athletes \u2014 from fencer Enzo Lefort and swimmer L\u00e9on Marchand to wheelchair tennis champion Pauline D\u00e9roul\u00e8de and para-cyclist Marie Patouillet \u2014 will also act as ambassadors for the brand. The Olympics, and the extraordinary journeys that athletes take to reach them, closely align with the values at the heart of the French luxury fashion house, its chairman and CEO Pietro Beccari told CNN in an interview at the brand\u2019s headquarters in Paris. \u201cWe talk about excellence, we spoke about quality, we spoke about being prepared for every challenge, and that is something that is very close to our heart,\u201d Beccari said, adding that Louis Vuitton is \u201cvery proud to be a French group\u201d and willing to support its home Olympics in the \u201cmost beautiful city in the world.\u201d As one would expect from a company who also designs the trophy trunks for such events as the soccer World Cup and the F1 Grand Prix de Monaco, these are no ordinary pieces of luggage. The interiors of both trunks are lined with matte black leather; one featuring circular \u201csockets\u201d in its base and lid to safely house and transport the Olympic torch, while the other contains enough drawers to store hundreds of medals. LVMH \u2013 the luxury conglomerate that owns Louis Vuitton \u2013 spent \u20ac150 million ($163 million) on its sponsorship deal with the Olympics, Vogue reported citing sources, though calculating the precise returns on this investment is \u201cdifficult,\u201d said Beccari.  \u201cWe believe this campaign is building values, building desirability,\u201d he said. \u201cQuantifying it is very difficult, not that we didn\u2019t try but it\u2019s very very difficult or impossible.\u201d The fashion house has long associated itself with sport, sponsoring nautical events like the Americas Cup, as well as launching a recent campaign centered around the friendship of tennis legends Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. \u201cWe are very close to sport,\u201d Beccari said, recalling the slogan \u201cVictory travels in Louis Vuitton,\u201d the fashion house used when one of its trunks housed the FIFA World Cup in 2010. \u201cI think it incarnates very well the DNA of Louis Vuitton, of what I was saying before, the challenges, the willingness to overcome yourself, to reach your destination and to be willing to go and discover more.\u201d This messaging underpinned a new campaign with Federer and Nadal sitting on a Louis Vuitton case on a snowy mountain in the Dolomites, discussing their rivalry, their biggest achievements and their sporting heroes. They\u2019re \u201ctwo beautiful young people that started from their little villages respectively in two different parts of Europe,\u201d Beccari said, \u201cand they became who they became so it\u2019s really part of this philosophy of excellence, of quality, of envy to surpass yourself over time again.\u201d While Louis Vuitton posted record profits last year and LVMH outperformed other luxury brands, the current economic environment with rising inflation leaving consumers with less disposable income poses challenges ahead, though Beccari downplayed such difficulties. \u201cIn terms of crisis, you always have to have the courage to see the opportunities and that\u2019s what we do,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there is a curve, and we like to do the curve with speed, so when the road will be straight again we\u2019ll have sufficient speed to be ahead of the others.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/style/louis-vuitton-pietro-beccari-olympics/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "style_yushi-li-the-smothering-dream-snap", "text": " A group of men lie at the foot of a sofa, their naked bodies peeking out through a carpet of rose petals. Some look toward the photograph\u2019s protagonist, an Asian woman in a lime green dress laying across the cushioned loveseat. Others gaze away, seemingly indifferent, as if caught in some sort of hazy spell. Despite Chinese photographer Yushi Li\u2019s gentle staging, her title for the photograph, \u201cThe Smothering Dream,\u201d suggests something more sinister is at play. Referencing Dutch painter Lawrence Alma-Tadema\u2019s 1888 work \u201cThe Roses of Heliogabalus,\u201d in which a Roman emperor watches on as unsuspecting banquet guests slowly suffocate in flowers, Li\u2019s modern take \u2014 shot on a set awash with pastel colors and delicate furniture \u2014 is equally deceptive at first glance. Li, is not only the photographer, but also the muse at the center of the image. \u201cI made this very pink and kitsch dream,\u201d she said, describing the London living room set in a phone interview. \u201cBut underneath it, there is, like, some kind of violence. It\u2019s a fantasy of love and eroticism\u2026 smothering these men I desire.\u201d Shot in 2022, \u201cThe Smothering Dream\u201d was recently on show at Photofairs Shanghai as part of a group exhibition called \u201cA Quiet Gaze.\u201d It was a fitting title to showcase the work of an artist for whom an examination of the male and female gazes has been a recurring theme. Li\u2019s wider portfolio of subversive images include softly-lit nude portraits of strangers she scouted through a dating app (a series titled \u201cMy Tinder Boys\u201d). Stripped of their clothes and therefore their character, she said, the men lounge around their homes doing banal tasks: one scoops out of a fresh watermelon, while another casually balances a plate of spaghetti over his private parts. The series is partly a response to erotic images objectifying women that are historically ubiquitous in art, advertisements and photography. Although a canon of male nudes does exist, it largely comprises images shot by gay male photographers. When Li began the series in 2017, she noticed a lack of images depicting naked men as objects of desire from a woman\u2019s perspective. After some mistook her work as being shot by a male photographer, she began inserting herself into the photos \u2014 fully clothed alongside naked counterparts, and often the only person looking directly at the camera. \u201cInstead of being a passive, \u2018looked-at\u2019 thing, I want to be the one who is in control, who is creating the story, who is expressing my fantasy,\u201d said Li. Her images have also pushed back against the longstanding fetishization of Asian women, often by Western men, something Li said she has experienced first-hand: \u201cI\u2019m a small person, and come across as quiet, so I kind of fit the stereotype.\u201d Li, who was born in China\u2019s Hunan province and now lives in the UK. She said she feels flattered when women reach out to her online to say they feel empowered by her photographs. \u201cAs a woman, especially as an Asian or Chinese woman, you (should be able to) feel that you can also express your erotic desire.\u201d Who\u2019s in power? Li has been fascinated with how the idea of the gaze has, today, become \u201cless binary.\u201d She has also been examining and playing with the way classical paintings depict power dynamics, portrayals of desire and representations of the body. She brings these ideas into \u201cPaintings, Dreams and Love,\u201d an ongoing project to which \u201cThe Smothering Dream\u201d belongs. (A second photo from the same shoot, entitled \u201cAfter the Dream,\u201d hints at what has just taken place, with satin cushions and wilted petals strewn about the scene). Other sources of inspiration include Swiss painter Henry Fuseli\u2019s 1781 \u201cThe Nightmare,\u201d showing an incubus crouching menacingly atop a sleeping woman, and \u201cThe Death of Actaeon,\u201d Renaissance painter Titian\u2019s 16th-century oil painting of the Romans\u2019 goddess of the hunt, Diana, transforming the Theban hero into a stag that is then killed by his own hounds. In Li\u2019s reinterpretations, she is in full control. In the former, she wears a tight, red turtleneck as she casually sits on an unsuspecting male figure, thwarting the idea of seduction. In the latter, she strikes a calm, calculated pose, pointing a bow and arrow at a naked man in a window. But control, Li says, is subjective in images where multiple gazes can co-exist. \u201cSome of these men (in the photographs) also look at me, and the viewer also looks at all of us,\u201d she said. The internet age, she added, has only further complicated matters. \u201cNow you can look at so many things like instantly, everywhere, or wherever, whenever you want\u2026 it\u2019s something very different, it\u2019s not (just) a physical thing, it\u2019s a digital thing. \u201cThere\u2019s also the gaze from the algorithm, and the gaze from the screen that reflects yourself when you look at it\u2026 the internet (means) we\u2019re subjected to the gaze more, in a way.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/yushi-li-the-smothering-dream-snap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_style_amiri-menswear-paris-fashion-week", "text": "Few cities have been so adamantly idealized, mythologized and captured on film and in photographs as Los Angeles and Paris. Inside the majestic\u00a0botanical garden\u00a0of \u201cJardin des Plantes\u201d\u00a0at the heart of Paris earlier this week, Mike Amiri, founder of\u00a0the\u00a0eponymous Californian label, brought these two worlds together in a cinematic show that brought Hollywood to the legendary \u201cRive Gauche\u201d of the\u00a0River\u00a0Seine. Accompanied by the tunes of\u00a0south London musician Yussef Dayes,\u00a0what emerged was\u00a0a collection about \u201cModern jazz, meaning both the music and and attitude\u201d\u00a0according to the show notes. Among influences,\u00a0the designer references Miles Davis\u00a0(who himself\u00a0had a special relationship with the City of Lights), as well as Duke Ellington and his Big Band\u00a0and\u00a0Dizzy Gillespie, all\u00a0of whom\u00a0fascinated him both for their stage presence and their off-stage life. These inspirations translated into\u00a0pieces in\u00a0faded, sun-washed teal, blue, gray and vintage-inspired knits. Formal tuxedos with d\u00e9grad\u00e9 beadings were fused with slouchier lines and flared pants as a nod to skate culture,\u00a0or\u00a0elevated with crystal-pinstripes. Like a golden thread running through the collection, models wore drum bags featuring a guitar pick as a lock, or music notes as brooches holding together a silk foulard. Interested both in craft and attitude,\u00a0Amiri, 47, sought\u00a0to be \u201coptimistic, not loud,\u201d as he put it\u00a0during a meeting a few days before the show. In the midst of model castings and fittings, he was calm and elegant, multi-tasking as his son Ryan, 13, came to join him in putting\u00a0the\u00a0final touches to the collection in a\u00a0temporary\u00a0studio set up near Paris\u2019s Avenue Montaigne. Amiri\u2019s two other children and wife were also in the city and present at the show. Since its launch in 2014, Amiri has looked to musicians as well as Americana\u00a0for a transcontinental discussion\u00a0of\u00a0luxury\u00a0\u2014\u00a0mixing thrifting with subcultures\u00a0such as\u00a0rock\u2019n\u2019roll, garage and skate. Having grown up in Hollywood to \u00e9migr\u00e9 Iranian parents, two blocks away from Hollywood Boulevard, Amiri was also deeply impacted by the stark cultural differences between LA neighborhoods such as Silver Lake, Venice Beach and the styles\u00a0that came with\u00a0that. Today, the designer has made a name for himself for the quality of his garments\u00a0and\u00a0his fluid, creative approach\u00a0that\u00a0walks a line between elegance and hype. The people he dresses all \u201cwant to have personality, but they don\u2019t want to look like they\u2019re faking young, it\u2019s a fine balance between looking modern and faking youth\u201d he said. Despite the recent announcement of South Korean musician Kim Sunwoo of K-pop band \u201cThe Boyz\u201d becoming a brand ambassador, many of Amiri\u2019s stars find\u00a0their\u00a0way to the independent\u00a0label organically, rather than by way of paid endorsements, the brand said. Perhaps because the world of celebrity is one Amiri is comfortable in, having been to\u00a0school with Angelina Jolie and Lenny Kravitz\u00a0\u2014\u00a0who he recently dressed (alongside\u00a0a diverse roster of celebrities such as like Ryan Gosling, Omar Sy, Lena Waithe and Barry Keoghan).\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s important not to chase everything, let it be organic,\u201d he said at the studio while examining final runway looks.\u00a0\u201cThe right people find you.\u201d In an age of hyper-visibility,\u00a0Amiri\u00a0appears\u00a0to be rethinking luxury\u00a0\u2014 or\u00a0\u201cmaking ordinary things extraordinary\u201d as he put it. This includes focusing on detail so fine it might not appear on camera, such as couture-level craftsmanship infused with DIY\u00a0techniques, twisting and reworking denim, leather and seemingly mundane textiles. To James Sleaford, editor-in-chief of men\u2019s fashion magazine ICON France, Amiri has fine-tuned chic, offering a fusion of American cool and technical know-how: \u201cPeople recognize a lot of what he does, the ripped jeans, but what you see when you look at the shows is pretty different, he is very cultured, and very into his tailoring\u201d he said. \u201cHe has brought\u00a0a real element of luxury to\u00a0American cool.\u201d Today, with a flagship boutique on Rodeo\u00a0Drive, the \u201cAmiri Prize,\u201d an award to \u201cencourage, nurture and showcase up-and-coming talent,\u201d a second retail space in Dubai and a pop-up store in Saint Tropez,\u00a0Amiri is\u00a0pursuing a worldwide dialogue.\u00a0\u201cIn a world where everything is shared and visible, there is definitely a blending of cultures\u00a0\u2014\u00a0not through geography, but the things people gravitate towards,\u201d he said. \u201cIf\u2026\u00a0people connect to your story, your aesthetic, maybe it\u2019s something about them they find in there,\u201d he continued.\u00a0\u201cSomething they want to bring out in themselves.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/style/amiri-menswear-paris-fashion-week/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_style_hot-rodent-men-celebrities", "text": "In the Chinese zodiac, 2024 is the year of the dragon. To the internet, it is the year of the rat. It began, seemingly, with a few innocuous social media posts comparing Mike Faist, co-star of the titillating tennis throuple film \u201cChallengers,\u201d to a dormouse. Soon, the complexity of the analogy snowballed to odd levels of specificity: He\u2019s a field mouse. No, he\u2019s a cartoon mouse. No, he\u2019s Despereaux (the dumbo-eared mouse from the 2008 animated film \u201cThe Tale of Despereaux\u201d). No, he\u2019s Stuart Little, if Stuart Little was hot. He was \u201clike if a sleepy cartoon mouse came to life and then got really into cross fit,\u201d wrote journalist Lucy Ford on X. And it wasn\u2019t long until fans on social media began examining the facial features of other male celebrities for similar signs of rodent likeness \u2014 Faist\u2019s \u201cChallengers\u201d co-star Josh O\u2019Connor, for example. Barry Keoghan. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. Jeremy Allen White. Glen Powell. This list goes on. From chinchillas to capybaras,\u00a0the rodent comparisons sped across social media like a runaway wheel of cheese, warping the image (and perhaps the confidence) of many popular, young white male celebrities in its path. On June 2, a Daily Mail article introduced this internet in-joke to the masses. \u201cHow \u2018hot rodent\u2019 men became Hollywood\u2019s sexiest heartthrobs: Gen Z fans are going wild for actors with unusual features including Barry Keoghan, Kieran Culkin and Jeremy Allen White,\u201d read the headline. The trend has since been covered by the New York Times, the Guardian, the London Times, NBC and the Today Show, among others. How do these men \u2014 heartthrobs of the moment, even \u2014 feel about being categorized as \u201chot rodents\u201d? Powell, who was first likened to a rodent back in 2023, has gamely praised the ingenuity of the chronically online. \u201cThis is why the internet\u2019s a great place,\u201d he told Jimmy Fallon last December. \u201cI really kind of own the capybara thing now. I am the capybara.\u201d Despite outreach, CNN did not receive a response from O\u2019Connor, Chalamet, Keoghan or White. (Faist\u2019s agent, meanwhile, confirmed that the actor does not use social media. A small mercy). But more broadly, the informal sampling of average Joes \u2014 or should that be average Jerrys? \u2014 CNN reached for comment largely didn\u2019t mind being dubbed ratty. Surveyed in a Whatsapp friend group, one 20-something admitted hearing the term would \u201churt,\u201d while another said he would be happy to embrace \u201chot rat summer.\u201d A third man polled shared\u00a0that despite an initial knee jerk reaction, he understood that \u201crodent men are very hot right now\u201d and so would probably be \u201cflattered.\u201d For some, the question goes beyond the hypothetical. One had already been called a \u201crat boy\u201d by his current girlfriend. \u201cShe\u2019s still with me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSo I\u2019ve taken it well.\u201d Similarly, Gustav, a 22-year-old X user, has also been compared to a mouse. (Stuart Little, to be precise \u2014 just like Faist.) \u201cI\u2019d say I mostly found the comment amusing,\u201d he told CNN via X. \u201cIt was clearly not meant as an insult and even though some people would take it as an insult, I mostly felt it was a way of saying that I was cute.\u201d While by no means exhaustive, these responses suggest men feel mostly fine with the \u201chot rodent\u201d trend. But if any male celebrity is struggling with the break-neck transition from traditional dreamboat to furry pin-up, perhaps the Chinese zodiac \u2014 which believes rats to be among the most intelligent, popular and charming animals of the 12-year cycle \u2014 can be some comfort, after all.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/style/hot-rodent-men-celebrities/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}

The painting depicts Jesus, Mary and Joseph resting on their way to Egypt after learning that Herod, King of Judea, wanted to kill the young Christ. Titian, whose real name was Tiziano Vecellio, made the work in the first decade of the 16th century, at the beginning of his career. Measuring just 18.25 inches by 24.75 inches (46.2 centimeters x 62.9 centimeters), the painting is tiny compared with some of the massive works for which Titian became known later in his life. The oil-on-canvas work has a remarkable history. After changing hands among various European aristocrats, the painting was looted by Napoleonic troops during the French occupation of Vienna in 1809 and taken to Paris. It was returned to Vienna in 1815 and again moved through private collections before ending up with John Alexander Thynne, 4th Marquess of Bath, in Wiltshire, England. In 1995, it was stolen from Longleat, the home of Thynne\u2019s descendants, and disappeared for seven years, before it was found at a bus stop in London by art detective Charles Hill. \u201cThis is a painting, then, that has been coveted by aristocrats, archdukes and emperors alike: prized for its vividly coloured scene of familial affection within the natural world,\u201d Christie\u2019s said in the statement. \u201cLike its subjects,\u00a0The Rest on the Flight into Egypt\u00a0has been on a long and eventful journey \u2014 a journey that\u2019s far from over.\u201d The painting will be offered as part of the Old Masters Part I auction at Christie\u2019s in London on July 2.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/style/titian-painting-auction-scli-intl-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}

And it\u2019s now been sold at auction for more than $700,000. \u201cOften mistakenly referred to as a door, the ornate structure was in reality part of the door frame just above the first-class lounge entrance,\u201d Heritage Auctions wrote in the auction notes. The prop\u2019s pivotal role in the \u201cbig scene, big goodbye\u201d moment, as the auction house had described it, features Rose floating on the floral-carved panel as Jack, having tried and failed to also rest atop, has succumbed to the cold.

The ornate balsa wood panel had previously been displayed at a Planet Hollywood in Orlando, Florida before being stored in their archives for some two decades, the auction house told CNN. It was sold alongside a roster of other props at the \u201cTreasures From Planet Hollywood\u201d auction, which included memorabilia items once displayed at Planet Hollywood locations worldwide and from its archives. These included pieces such as the whip from\u00a0\u201cIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\u201d and the ax from \u201cThe Shining.\u201d Across almost 1,600 lots in total, the five-day-long auction brought in $15.7 million, according\u00a0to a press release. But the \u201cTitanic\u201d flotsam took the prize for the highest-priced piece, far exceeding its starting price of $40,000 and selling for a grand total of $718,750 following a high-energy bidding war. Several other \u201cTitanic\u201d props were also put up for sale, including the pastel chiffon evening gown Rose wears in the movie on the night of the sinking and the ship\u2019s helm wheel, which sold for $118,750 and $200,000 respectively. A 2012 episode of the Discovery show \u201cMythBusters\u201d infamously found that two people could have survived long enough on the panel \u2014 which measures approximately eight feet (2.4 meters) long and just over three feet (1 meter) wide \u2014 if they added a life jacket for extra buoyancy. Remarking on the results, however, \u201cTitanic\u201d director James Cameron told the show\u2019s hosts, Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage, that Jack needed to die regardless. And in 2022, Cameron, alongside a hypothermia expert, tried to put an end to the debate once and for all with a\u00a0simulated test\u00a0to see if two people of the same body mass as Winslet and DiCaprio could have really stayed afloat on a piece of wood of the same size. Their final answer was no, it was not possible. There was no additional testing of these theories on the prop itself prior to its sale, as the auction house chooses to \u201chandle all items with great care when in transit and in storage,\u201d Heritage Auctions told CNN. But its new owner, who is choosing to remain anonymous, could well be planning a pool day, having been drawn in by the allure of the over two-decade-long mystery. \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is this massive interest in the films of the 1980s and 1990s,\u201d said Joe Maddalena, executive vice president of Heritage Auctions, in a statement. \u201cThere has been a generational shift to where these massive franchises of the 1980s and 1990s \u2014 the \u2018Home Alone\u2019s, the \u2018Indiana Jones\u2019 films, the \u2018Die Hard\u2019s \u2014 are now collectors\u2019 favorites\u2026 Collectors are finally rewarding these artifacts as what they are: cultural artifacts akin to the fine art of old.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/style/titanic-door-prop-auction-planet-hollywood/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_style_parties-monaco-grand-prix-f1", "text": "The Monaco Grand Prix gets underway this weekend in Monte Carlo with its heady combination of glamor and adrenaline, not only for the tens of thousands who descend on the pristine principality, but for the millions watching across the world. Even those who are typically indifferent to motorsports can find themselves enraptured, or at least intrigued, by the sheer spectacle of Formula One cars hurtling along the country\u2019s winding streets. It is also where you will find celebrities happily jostling their way through the crowds and cameras. \u201cIt is unlike anything I have ever been to, it is electric,\u201d exclaimed Spider-Man actor Tom Holland while walking last year\u2019s grid. And of course, there is plenty of wealth on display. Monaco is nicknamed \u201cthe billionaires\u2019 playground\u201d for good reason. Here, designer stores, supercars, multi-million-dollar yachts and astronomically priced restaurants are \u2018la norme\u2019, but during the three-day Grand Prix, the eye-watering ostentation increases three-fold. When demand is high and options are limited, it is all to play for among the world\u2019s wealthiest who are keen to revel in the race\u2019s iconic location and party \u2018til dawn. If they are not using their own superyacht as a base, they might book into a private villa on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur or check-in to Fairmont Hotel, H\u00f4tel Hermitage or H\u00f4tel de Paris in Monte Carlo itself. A pioneer of Grand Prix party culture Of course, it is not only about finding the finest suites to rest your head, but the premium spots for dining and clubbing, whether it is the top table at Cipriani, Sass Caf\u00e9 or Caf\u00e9 de Paris or the best booth at exclusive night spots such as Jimmy\u2019z or Amber Lounge. The latter has the distinction of being the go-to destination for the F1 fraternity, including Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen, while previous guests have included Justin Bieber, Kim Kardashian, Kylie Minogue and Prince Albert of Monaco. Established in 2003 by former racing driver Eddie Irvine\u2019s sister Sonia as a \u201cpost-race destination\u201d for drivers and VIP guests, Amber Lounge is regarded a pioneer of the Grand Prix party culture. Notably, it will be marking its 20-year milestone (there was a year off during Covid) as \u201cthe most exclusive party in the world\u201d with panache over the Monaco weekend with three nights of events costing just over \u20ac1.5m ($1.6m) to produce. There will be after parties at an Amber Lounge beach club on the terrace of Le Meridien Beach Plaza (the only hotel in Monte Carlo with its own private beach), as well as VIP viewing of the race from aboard a 108ft superyacht moored just feet from the circuit\u2019s famous Tabac corner. \u201cThe size of the yacht also means we are as close to the action as you can get, unlike the larger yachts that are pulled back (from the coast). It also feels more intimate and exclusive on board. We have a lot of repeat clients (typically from the US, UK and Middle East) who want to network and build relationships,\u201d said Lauren Green, Managing Director of Amber Lounge who oversees logistics of the three-day pop-up event in Monaco, as well as other F1 locations including Singapore, Las Vegas and Abu Dhabi. Unsurprisingly, a ticket to one of the most coveted trackside spots does not come cheap. A one-day VIP viewing package for the race itself on Sunday costs \u20ac3,500 ($3,800) per person \u2014 and the 65 available tickets sold out within two weeks of going on sale in May 2023. While the dress code is \u2018Riviera chic,\u2019 shoes, however expensive, must be discarded on embarking so as not to ruin the yacht\u2019s teak decking. Tickets include free-flowing beverages, including champagne, wine and signature cocktails, as well as food, a DJ and dancers before tenders return to shore at 6.30pm. \u2018The center of the universe for a weekend\u2019 At the club\u2019s after parties held over the race weekend, a small army of waiting staff serve ever-flowing drinks for a 1000 strong crowd on Saturday and Sunday nights. On arrival, guests ring a bell and a gloved hand appears through a flower wall proffering a glass of champagne. Attendees have paid anything from \u20ac600 ($650) for entry to the afterparty on Saturday (the F1 qualifying day) to \u20ac800 ($870) on the Sunday (race day) in the hope they can party alongside drivers, celebrities and guests of high net worth, away from the public gaze. For \u20ac40,000 ($43,400), partygoers can book what\u2019s known as a \u201cdiamond table package\u201d for 10 people \u2014 a prime table with unobstructed views of the stage and DJ booth (Fatman Scoop and Jax Jones are the acts for 2024), as well as cirqus-themed performances, and Methuselahs of champagne (6-liters) and premium vodka. Add an extra \u20ac10,000 ($10,800) on for a Salmanazar \u2014 a nine-liter bottle of champagne that requires a team of four to carry it to the table, or \u20ac20,000 ($21,600) for a 12-liter Balthazar-sized bottle. The top-tier tables also have their own \u201chosts,\u201d who act as a concierge; liaising with VIPs\u2019 assistants or drivers to ensure guests can be greeted and escorted along the black carpet without having to queue. Amber Lounge might be one of the most exclusive and expensive events taking place during the Monaco Grand Prix weekend, but Monte Carlo itself is a veritable party hub. It\u2019s common for champagne glasses and bottles to be cleared from the track from the previous night\u2019s revelry ahead of that day\u2019s qualifying or race sessions. \u201cThe C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur is one of the truly exceptional global destinations, and Monaco is at the heart of it. The scenery, the sophistication, and the opulence are unmatched,\u201d said Bruce Bundrant, Senior Vice President of Business Development for rEvolution, a global sports marketing agency who lived in Monaco for three years as Commercial Director for AS Monaco FC. \u201cAs a former resident, I can tell you there are two sides to the F1 Grand Prix arriving in Monaco. On one side, your town is now the center of the universe for a weekend where the top 1% of the 1% from all over the world arrive and engage in outrageous parties and events on yachts, at luxury hotels suites, and in hilltop mansions,\u201d Bundrant explained. \u201cOn the other, it\u2019s the hybrid of the arrival of a hurricane and New Year\u2019s Eve. A week out from the race, grocery store shelves are emptied as locals know it\u2019s impossible to move around the principality when the F1 circus is in town. During the Grand Prix, your quiet, regular neighborhood bar has a line around the corner, charges a $100 cover charge, and a drink that typically costs $20 will be $50. But it\u2019s a truly unforgettable weekend, with an unreplicable buzz and energy. Sure, it\u2019s expensive, but come the Monday, things are back to normal.\u201d As normal as it can ever be in a place as excessive as Monaco. As the jet set move onto their next port of call, and the racetrack is dismantled, so too is the Amber Lounge club as preparations continue for their next F1 event, which will be Singapore in September. \u201cThere is no rest at Amber Lounge,\u201d Green quipped. \u201cJust a lot of adrenaline. And a lot of coffee.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/style/parties-monaco-grand-prix-f1/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "style_worlds-largest-3d-printer-homes-maine-hnk-spc-intl", "text": "Dozens of 3D-printed homes have been built across the world \u2013 to house a family in the US state of Virginia or members of an impoverished community in rural Mexico. The world\u2019s largest 3D-printed neighborhood is currently under construction outside of Austin, Texas. The technology could be especially handy in a place like the US state of Maine, where approximately 80,000 new homes will be needed by 2030 to address a shortage, according to a report released last year by three state agencies. \u201cPeople can\u2019t find homes, they\u2019re very expensive. We also have an aging population \u2026 so there\u2019s less and less people who are electricians, plumbers, or builders,\u201d Habib Dagher, the executive director of the University of Maine\u2019s Advanced Structures and Composites Center (ASCC), told CNN via video call. He says he\u2019s got a solution. Last month, the ASCC unveiled what it says is the world\u2019s largest polymer 3D printer. Dagher hopes the-so-called \u201cFactory of the Future 1.0\u201d can help address the state\u2019s housing crisis \u2013 and revolutionize 3D-home-printing in the process. \u201cThe approach we\u2019ve taken is quite different from what you\u2019ve seen, and you\u2019ve been reading about for years,\u201d he says. A home every 48 hours In recent years, 3D-printing has been used to build everything from businesses to bridges to mosques. One non-profit is even working on printing schools in a war zone. Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, holds the Guinness World Record for the world\u2019s biggest 3D-printed structure and aims to have 25% of new buildings constructed with 3D printing technology by 2030. A great majority of current printing relies on concrete, with a robotic arm equipped with a nozzle layering wet concrete into the right shape. ASCC is flipping the script. Its giant printer, and its predecessor, which in 2019 was certified by Guinness World Records as the \u201clargest prototype polymer 3D printer,\u201d are the only printers building homes with wood residuals, says Dagher. The technology has already been tested. In late 2022, the university unveiled the \u201cBioHome3D,\u201d a 600-square-foot single-family unit which it says is the world\u2019s first 100% bio-based 3D-printed home, built from local wood fiber and bio-resin materials. \u201cWhen they\u2019re doing concrete, they\u2019re only printing the walls,\u201d says Dagher. He adds that the floor, roof and walls of the BioHome3D were all printed. Concrete homes also need to be built on site, he says. That can be problematic, especially during the snowy New England winter. \u201cWhen the weather goes bad for two weeks at a time, you can\u2019t print,\u201d he adds. By contrast, ASCC printed prefabricated modules at the university and bolted them together on site to create BioHome3D. The new printer can produce objects as large as 96 feet long by 32 feet wide by 18 feet\u202fhigh and can print up to 500 pounds per hour. Dagher says that the goal is to be able to print 1,000 pounds of material in an hour. At that rate, it could reproduce the BioHome3D in 48 hours, he says. If they can reach that target, their 3D-printed homes will be \u201cvery competitive with current housing construction costs,\u201d he adds. But it can be difficult to process wood materials at such a high speed. Even ASCC\u2019s record-breaking printers sometimes jam. While printing BioHome3D, for example, the printer stopped working due to a dust buildup. \u201cNobody\u2019s ever done this before with these kinds of materials,\u201d says Dagher. \u2018When can I have one?\u2019 The BioHome3D\u2019s warm wooden floors and walls give it the look of a sleek, modern Scandinavian-inspired log cabin. \u201cMany people feel concrete is a cold thing to look at and it\u2019s not necessarily where you want to live,\u201d says Dagher. The BioHome3D, however, is \u201cvery warm and inviting.\u201d It\u2019s also sustainable. When a home is no longer needed or wanted it can be ground up and used to print something else. ASCC is using wood residuals from Maine\u2019s sawmills in its research, and looking into scaling up production using these local byproducts. Thousands of people have toured the prototype on the university\u2019s Orono, Maine campus, and Dagher says it\u2019s a rare occurrence when a visitor doesn\u2019t ask, \u201c\u2019When can I have one?\u2019\u201d \u201cWe hear, \u2018You know, I\u2019m retiring, and I want to downsize. Can I put one of these up?\u2019\u201d Dagher says. There are some obstacles to overcome first. \u201cIt takes years for codes to change,\u201d says Dagher, referring to building codes that construction companies must meet. The printer won\u2019t displace traditional home construction, but in the future 3D printed homes are likely to comprise a larger share of the world\u2019s housing stock, he predicts. The ASCC is now doing work on how to incorporate conduits for wiring and plumbing \u201cexactly where an architect would want them\u201d into the printing process, he adds. The printer\u2019s next big project is a nine-home neighborhood for people experiencing homelessness. ASCC is partnering with a local NGO to design the structures, and printing is set to kick off in 2025.", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/worlds-largest-3d-printer-homes-maine-hnk-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_style_princess-diana-exhibition-london-intl-scli-gbr", "text": "Some of the most unforgettable photos of Princess Diana, such as her \u201crevenge dress\u201d that broke royal protocol and her handshake with an AIDS patient that changed the way the world treated those with the illness, have gone on display in a new exhibition in London. The exhibition, which is being held at Dockside Vaults just north of London\u2019s Tower Bridge and runs from May 25 to September 2, traces Diana\u2019s life as a humanitarian, a mother and a fashion icon. It displays a carefully curated selection of work by renowned royal photographer Anwar Hussein, 85, who started snapping Diana when she was 19. \u201cAt first, some told me \u2018you can\u2019t do pictures of royals,\u2019\u201d Anwar told CNN ahead of the exhibition\u2019s launch. \u201cI said, \u2018why not? I want a change.\u2019 I was doing rock and roll pictures - Bob Marley, Elton John, The Beatles. And then I got fed up with show business.\u201d Weaving through the vault\u2019s underground network of tunnels, CNN was given a tour of the exhibition by Anwar\u2019s two sons, Samir, 45, and Zak, 43. The pair have followed in their father\u2019s footsteps to become royal photographers in their own right, snapping viral photos of younger generations of the royal family. \u201cDiana did really buck the trend, especially for royals. She changed so much, and things that are now seen as normal, such as what Kate or Meghan wear, it was really Diana that changed all of that,\u201d said Samir, standing in front of a floor-to-ceiling print of the famed \u201crevenge dress\u201d photo, taken at a Vanity Fair party on the same day that Charles publicly admitted to adultery. \u201cA lot of people didn\u2019t think she was going to come out, and then she just came out looking like a million dollars and made a really big statement that, \u2018I\u2019m not going to hide away, I\u2019m still going to be my own person,\u2019\u201d Zak added. For Anwar, it\u2019s a very different photo that stands out to him. \u201cThis was Diana\u2019s favorite,\u201d he said, looking up at a photo of Diana cradling a young cancer patient during a trip to a hospital in Lahore, Pakistan, in 1996. \u201cThe boy was blind. He smelled of all these chemicals they had been using, but she didn\u2019t care and she cuddled him,\u201d Anwar said. \u201cLater on, he died and she was very sad about that. It shows her humanitarian side.\u201d Over the years, Anwar and his sons have taken hundreds of thousands of photos of the royal family. There is one word, however, which seems to encapsulate the images on display: legacy. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want (the exhibition) to be controversial. We wanted it to be a celebration of Diana\u2019s life and her legacy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had \u2018The Crown,\u2019 we\u2019ve had films about Diana, so it feels like there is a whole new generation experiencing it.\u201d And for Samir and Zak, their father\u2019s influence has also had a profound impact on their lives, something which is illustrated by two almost identical, yet eerily different, photos on display in another part of the exhibition. In the first photo, taken in 1992, Diana sits alone in front of the Taj Mahal in India, her red and purple suit, designed by Catherine Walker, is a pop of color against the softer backdrop of the ivory-white marble mausoleum. Anwar was told on the day of the Taj Mahal visit that Charles had other engagements, so Diana went without him, Zak says, recalling his father\u2019s recollections. \u201cShe ended up posing up in front of it, in front of this monument to love,\u201d he said. \u201cFairly soon afterwards, they announced their separation.\u201d Some 24 years later, Zak returned to the same spot to photograph Prince William and his wife, Catherine. \u201cThere was a lot of speculation. Would they recreate the picture of Diana there?\u201d Zak said. \u201cThey arrived and sat on the bench, but this time it\u2019s two people that are very much in love.\u201d In many ways, the exhibition is a love letter to two families: the Husseins behind the lens, multiple generations of royals in front of it. \u201c(Our father has) never done anything like this before,\u201d Samir said. \u201cHe\u2019s getting on now, he\u2019s a bit older and I think he really wanted to do a celebration of what he had done and a celebration of her as a person.\u201d In a statement, Anwar said: \u201cI am delighted that the images captured, as well as those of my sons, are coming home to London to recognize and memorialize such a remarkable woman and her sons.\u201d Tickets for the exhibition, which start at \u00a317 (about $22), include a 60-minute audio tour detailing the first-hand accounts behind each photograph.

{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it.

{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_style_my-america-diana-matar-police-shootings", "text": "In 2015 alone, 1,146 people died during or after interactions with law enforcement officials in the US. In 2016, the death toll was 1,093, per \u201cThe Counted,\u201d a special report and database from The Guardian. (In both years, the vast majority of deaths were classified as due to gunshot wounds, with a small number of fatalities after individuals were tased, struck by police vehicles or reported as a \u201cdeath in custody.\u201d) For the photographer Diana Matar, seeking to memorialize these deaths \u2014 and the liminal spaces they represent \u2014 proved overwhelming to consider as a project, even at a smaller scale. She narrowed her focus down to four states; California and Texas, because they had the highest number of such incidents across the country, and Oklahoma and New Mexico because they consistently had some of the highest rates per capita. \u201cI thought I could photograph (where) every encounter happened in two years in these four states, and it just became impossible,\u201d Matar told CNN. \u201cTimewise, financially, in every possible way.\u201d Still, over some three years of photography trips, Matar drove hundreds of miles across the four states, visiting more than 300 locations where people had died during (or following) an encounter with law enforcement officers in 2015 and 2016. 110 of these images are published now in the monograph \u201cMy America;\u201d quiet, monochromatic images of everyday sites like parking lots, rural roads and suburban sidewalks. Patches of grass at an empty roadside mark the place where 40-year-old Terence Crutcher was killed by a police officer in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 2016. In Addison, Texas, birds perching on telephone wires overlook the site where 16-year-old Jose Cruz was murdered by an off duty police officer that same year. (In 2018, the officer was sentenced to 10 years in prison, having been found guilty of murder and aggravated assault.) Two chairs on a sunny sidewalk in Los Angeles, California, indicate where 37-year-old Norma Guzman, 37, was shot and killed by police officers in 2015. Beside each image in the book are three brief lines of biographical information: the name of the deceased, their birth and death years, and the site\u2019s location. \u201cI was really adamant about how the photographs would be presented. I just wanted it to be a name,\u201d said Matar, who consulted family and victims\u2019 support groups. \u201cI didn\u2019t want the last thing to be thought of about these people was the way they died. These were people, with lives.\u201d \u201cThere are so many images, and so many images of violence that we kind of turn off,\u201d Matar added of today\u2019s era of social media and smartphones. \u201cI think we need space to digest, and I wanted to approach this in a way that was quite quiet. I wanted images that did not reinforce the violence. I wanted images that you can look at, and imagine this very banal place as the last place someone has been.\u201d An internationally acclaimed photographer and distinguished artist at Columbia University\u2019s Barnard College in New York City, Matar\u2019s relationship with documenting landscapes and violence is rooted in her own personal experiences. In 1990, her father-in-law was forcibly disappeared by the Gadhafi regime in Libya, and was never seen by his family again. \u201cI was familiar with this idea of the legacy of state-sponsored violence and what it does intimately to a family\u2026 but also really looking at it through photography and what these landscapes hold,\u201d Matar said. Matar was born in California but has lived abroad for nearly two decades. Her photographic practice has taken her to locations across Libya, North Africa, Italy and Ukraine looking at the intersections of landscape and memory, in particular examining spaces where people had been killed or forcibly interned. But before beginning her work on \u201cMy America,\u201d she had never turned her lens on the US. In 2014 and 2015, the police killings of Black men and boys including Eric Garner in New York City, 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Cleveland, Ohio and Walter Scott in Charleston, South Carolina, captured on camera and shared on social media, sparked national protests and a racial reckoning. Matar felt compelled to return to America. \u201cI had worked on issues around landscapes of violence and state violence for many years outside of my home country, and I wanted to start researching what was happening from that point of view (in the US).\u201d Using a range of sources \u2014 including victim databases, media coverage, district attorney documents and police reports \u2014 Matar made her work during six lengthy road trips. She would watch videos or local news coverage of what happened at the location right before photographing the site in question. \u201cThat really was very emotionally affecting,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery time I got out of the car, I was very aware I was not just taking a photograph of a landscape or of a building. I was photographing something that held the last moments of someone\u2019s life \u2014 unless they had been taken to hospital, it was the place where these deaths happened. It made me think about my country, and made me question so many things. \u201d Of all the sites Matar visited, she said only seven had a memorial of some kind, whether that was a mural, flowers, memorabilia or photos. In a way, though, the photographs and the information placed alongside them in \u201cMy America\u201d have a memorial-like quality of their own; Matar emphasizes this was a conscious decision in the book\u2019s design. \u201cI wanted a lot of white space in there, because I wanted the viewer to sit and think, and not just move on quickly,\u201d she said. While the biographical information next to each photograph is sparse, Matar researched and wrote a longer passage of text dedicated to each person\u2019s life, and death, which is included in the book\u2019s final pages. She describes her research of the wider issues relating to law-enforcement related deaths as \u201ceven more affecting\u201d than the process of making the photographs. This is exemplified in a series of pages in the middle of the book which outline key statistics related to such deaths, those impacted and factors involved \u2014 like that the number of people who die in encounters with police each year (around 1,000) has not changed in the nine years since Matar started researching the project in 2015. \u201cWhen you see all the things that go into why this is occurring \u2014 the lack of mental health beds, the lack of arms training, the racial injustice \u2014 there\u2019s so many things that come together in this particular challenge,\u201d Matar reflected. \u201cThis book is placing this type of violence in a continuum of a lot of violence in the history of the country.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have an illusion that this work is going to change anything, she continued. \u201cWhat I do think, though, is that pointing a camera at something, researching something, writing about something \u2014 all these things require great attention. And that attention is saying that this matters, this really matters.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/style/my-america-diana-matar-police-shootings/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_style_youthforia-black-foundation-shade", "text": "When cosmetic company Youthforia launched\u00a0its \u201cDate Night Skin Tint\u201d serum foundation\u00a0line in 15 shades last year, some beauty influencers and reviewers were critical\u00a0of the lack of options for darker skin tones. Golloria\u00a0George, a Texas-based beauty influencer with over 1.5 million followers on TikTok,\u00a0shared\u00a0why\u00a0she felt\u00a0the brand had missed the mark\u00a0\u2014 and an opportunity \u2014\u00a0in a TikTok video last September\u00a0that racked up more than 2.4 million views. In her series, \u201cThe Darkest Shade,\u201d George reviews the darkest shade in a brand\u2019s lineup to see if it could match her complexion. The darkest Youthforia shade,\u00a0she claimed,\u00a0was lighter than what was advertised online and didn\u2019t match her skin tone. It\u2019s a criticism many brands have faced over the years, as the beauty industry \u2014 which critics have long accused of\u00a0elevating Eurocentric beauty standards\u00a0\u2014 tries to expand its product lines for melanated skin tones. Youthforia\u00a0is a \u201cclean and sustainable makeup company\u201d that markets\u00a0itself as \u201cmakeup you can sleep in,\u201d according to its website. The company\u2019s founder, Fiona Co Chan, appeared on an episode of the TV series\u00a0\u201cShark Tank\u201d that aired in 2023\u00a0and\u00a0received a $400,000 investment from\u00a0billionaire Mark Cuban. In March, the beauty brand\u00a0added 10 new shades\u00a0to its \u201cDate Night\u201d collection, many for darker complexions. George told CNN she was still unsure if one of\u00a0the new products would be a match, so she again tried the brand\u2019s darkest shade \u2014 600 Deep Neutral \u2014 and was stunned by the result. \u201cWhich side of my face is the black face paint or the\u00a0Youthforia\u00a0foundation?\u201d\u00a0she asked in\u00a0a Tiktok\u00a0video posted April 30. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell. You know why? Tar in a bottle.\u201d That video now has over 24 million views. Youthforia did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Last year, Chan defended her brand in a post that has since been deleted.\u00a0Earlier this year,\u00a0days before the new products launched, Youthforia\u00a0posted a video\u00a0on TikTok where Chan says the brand had trouble finding models to match the darkest shades they offer. \u201cSo a month ago we held a casting call to just look for real people, real skin. We found matches for most of our shades except for our dark shades,\u201d she says in the video. In the days that followed, the brand posted\u00a0a series of view of videos showing Chan searching for models and ultimately testing the foundation on two young men who \u201cgraciously agreed to be our models\u201d in a mall. She applies the 600 foundation \u2014 the same one George used \u2014 to half of one model\u2019s face and remarks on how it appears to be a match. \u201cHis undertone was actually perfect,\u201d she says. Last week, Youthforia replied to a comment about the brand\u2019s darkest shade by resharing the video from March. While George acknowledges the shade may work for some customers, she\u00a0also\u00a0posted a separate video where she reviews the brand\u2019s second darkest shade, 590, which she notes \u201cleans very red on me.\u201d George told CNN she found the transition between the two darkest products offered by Youthforia to be \u201cshocking.\u201d \u201cIt was like we really just missed a whole range of undertones and depth and it\u2019s disrespectful,\u201d she said. And she\u00a0wasn\u2019t the only one remarking on the brand\u2019s attempt to provide products for darker skin tones, with other content creators calling out the brand and\u00a0even trying to mix shades together\u00a0to create lighter options. George told CNN\u00a0 the saga reminded her of not being\u00a0able to\u00a0find shades of makeup that matched her complexion when she was younger. \u201cIt was a big deal. It was really disheartening,\u201d she said. \u201cI really felt like there was something wrong with me, you know, and no one deserves to feel like that.\u201d Karen Chambers, chair of the diversity, equity & inclusion taskforce at Cosmetic Executive Women, said\u00a0Youthforia is not the only brand to face this sort of criticism from customers. The success of Rhianna\u2019s FENTY launch in 2017 saw many makeup brands working to expand their product offerings. But in 2020, influencers called for a boycott of Hourglass Cosmetics after the company released a\u00a0fan-favorite foundation\u00a0with a limited shade range. In 2018, Tarte\u2019s Shape Tape line also faced similar criticism, causing beauty influencer NikkieTutorials to\u00a0remove a video\u00a0about the product and call their shade range \u201can absolute mess.\u201d Chambers, who has\u00a0worked with brands such as\u00a0IMAN Cosmetics, Dark & Lovely and Posner\u00a0throughout her 28-year career, said\u00a0in the past five or so years brands have recognized the need for more conversations around diversity and inclusivity. \u201cWhether it\u2019s domestically or globally, demographics are changing and if a brand is not inclusive in what they offer, then they are just missing a huge opportunity as far as just accurately being there for their consumer base,\u201d\u00a0she said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve seen brands that have gotten (an) \u2018A\u2019 in their efforts to diversify and we\u2019ve seen brands that have gotten an \u2018F\u2019\u00a0and everywhere in between.\u201d In addition to research,\u00a0Chambers said, the\u00a0businesses\u00a0should incorporate diversity as a whole. \u201cCertainly as in this instance, in those laboratories, you\u2019ve got to have someone who understands that creating darker shades for brown skin is not as easy as adding black to an existing one that\u2019s created for light skin.\u201d It is unclear how Youthforia created its formulas for foundation shades. George said she now feels\u00a0it\u2019s important to call out brands and the industry as a whole when they\u00a0exclude darker complexions. \u201cIt kind of feels like a slap in the face. It kind of feels like you know, not only are we just not being seen, but we\u2019re also just like, not even being considered and it\u2019s just really horrible,\u201d George said. \u201cI feel like it just goes to show how rampant colorism is still in the beauty industry.\u201d \u201cThere are a lot of people in this world, and everyone deserves to be able to try makeup, play with makeup and, you know, just be included,\u201d she added. \u201cThe girls are here. We\u2019ve been here and you know everyone deserves a spot in this industry.\u201d Chambers said Youthforia\u00a0needs to rebuild trust with its audience \u2014 and that starts with making sure the audience feels included and important. Many of the brand\u2019s posts and advertisements on social media feature people of color. \u201cIt\u2019s also just good business,\u201d Chambers added. \u201cThere really is no\u00a0way to be in this industry and not take diversity seriously. I think any brand out here that really wants to continue to grow and evolve \u2026 It makes for a better company.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/youthforia-black-foundation-shade/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_style_paris-2024-olympic-village", "text": "When Paris last hosted the Summer Olympics 100 years ago, organizers were so keen to bring athletes under the same roof that they built the first-ever Olympic Village. It was spartan, made up of furnished wood huts, and it was razed shortly after. The competition is back in the City of Lights a century later, but French officials are doing something completely different this time around. As part of their effort to make Paris 2024 the \u201cmost responsible and sustainable games in history,\u201d they\u2019re building something that\u2019s meant to last. \u201cThis village was thought up as a neighborhood, a neighborhood that is going to have a life afterwards,\u201d said Georgina Grenon, the Paris 2024 director of sustainability. \u201cParis 2024 is renting it for a few months.\u201d Instead of rooming in apartments tailor-made for them, athletes in the Olympic Village this summer will be living in what will become someone else\u2019s home or workplace. Once the Paralympics have finished on September 8, the village \u2014 which contains 82 buildings \u2014 will be converted into office space for 6,000 workers and apartments to house another 6,000 people. The hope is that the project will provide a model to alleviate a housing crisis in the French capital, where rising interest rates, surging prices and a supply crunch have made it harder than ever to buy or rent a home. Demand for affordable housing is so intense that when a small 10 square meter (108 square feet) apartment in Paris\u2019 up-and-coming 10th arrondissement hit the rental market last year at a price of 610 euros ($614) per month, it attracted a staggering 765 applicants in less than a week. The site for the Olympic Village was chosen in the hopes it would revitalize some of the city\u2019s historically impoverished northern suburbs. The village lies at the juncture of three suburbs: Saint-Denis, a diverse, working-class neighborhood long associated with crime and insecurity; the rapidly gentrifying Saint-Ouen; and Ile-Saint-Denis, an island on the Seine River. Organizers say post-Olympics, 32% of the new homes in Saint-Denis and Saint-Ouen, and 48% of those in Ile-Saint-Denis built for the Games will be set aside for public housing. There\u2019s a risk, however, that current residents could be priced out. Similar pledges to build affordable housing in east London were made in advance of the 2012 Olympics, but those promises ended up largely falling flat. A BBC report in 2022 found that of the 9,000 homes built within the Olympic Park, less than 200 were offered at the cheapest levels of rent. \u2018It\u2019s a huge test lab\u2019 Like the Olympics themselves \u2014 which organizers say will run 100% on renewable energy \u2014 everything built for the village was done with sustainability in mind. To minimize the amount of construction, organizers temporarily or permanently retrofitted several existing structures on the site, including an old electric factory that\u2019s been turned into a \u201cresident center.\u201d They also rented existing movie studios in the area to be used as training facilities for athletes instead of building new training facilities which has been done at some other Games. The buildings that were erected were built with wood and recycled materials, employing processes that, according to Grenon, reduced the project\u2019s carbon footprint by 30% per square meter \u2014 more than French ecological regulations require. A third of all the rooftops are equipped with solar panels, while another third have gardens meant to bring down the temperature inside, Grenon said. And long, straight openings leading to the Seine were left in between the buildings to form wind tunnels carrying the fresh air near the river as far inland as possible. Temperatures this summer are expected to be warmer than normal, according to France\u2019s national weather service, and there is widespread concern heat could jeopardize athlete safety. But the structures themselves aren\u2019t the only thing that will be recycled. The village will house about 3,000 apartments containing a total of 14,250 beds made with recyclable materials similar to the ones used in Tokyo. The mattresses were manufactured with reused materials and their firmness can be adjusted by flipping them over. Stools were made with cardboard meaning they can be easily recycled after the Olympics. Across the village, organizers are running a handful of experiments to see if new green technologies and construction methods are viable in the real world. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge test lab,\u201d Grenon said. One sidewalk has been made with seashells. In theory, those shells are supposed to absorb rain. On hot days, the stored water should evaporate and help cool passers-by. The village\u2019s main drag features five experimental outdoor air filters. These giant, UFO-like towers are designed like vacuums to suck in the polluted air and filter out dangerous particles. The device can clean \u201c95% of the air of the particulate matter \u2014 all sizes,\u201d its creator, Jerome Giacomoni, told CNN. The five devices can clean the equivalent of the volume of 40 Olympic-sized swimming pools an hour with very little electricity consumption, Giacomoni said. Keeping cool The most scrutinized innovation will likely be the geothermal cooling system, as athletes in Paris could face the same level of sweltering heat and humidity that broiled Tokyo during the Summer Olympics there three years ago. \u201cClimate change should increasingly be viewed as an existential threat to sport,\u201d Sebastian Coe, the president of World Athletics, said in a report published last week (June 18) examining the heat risks associated with this summer\u2019s games. While the ground floor of some buildings in the Olympic Village are equipped with traditional air conditioning because they will be converted into shops after the Olympics, the athlete apartments will use geothermal cooling instead of air conditioning. This system takes water cooled to 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit) from wells as deep as 70 meters (230 feet) underground at a nearby geothermal plant and transports them to pipes under the floors of each apartment. That cold water should be able to cool the building by 6 to 10 degrees Celsius compared to the temperature outside, according to Laurent Michaud, the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Village director. While the system will be controlled at the building level, each apartment has a thermostat that allows them to lower or raise the temperature by 2 degrees Celsius in each unit. The system will also heat apartments in the winter. The human-caused climate crisis has made heat waves more frequent and intense, and they are starting earlier in the year in many parts of the world. Paris is particularly vulnerable \u2014 people in the French capital are more likely to die from extreme heat than any other city in Europe, a study that looked at more than 850 cities showed. As of 2022, just 19% of all households in Europe were equipped with air conditioning, according to the most recent figures from the International Energy Agency. But extreme heat across the world has driven up global demand for AC units, creating a climate Catch-22, as air conditioning systems use large amounts of energy, much of which still comes from fossil fuels that emit carbon dioxide and heats the planet. For delegations concerned about the system\u2019s efficacy during a heat wave, the village will offer them the option to rent individual air conditioning units. Asked about the lack of air conditioning in the Village by news agency Reuters in March, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said the village was \u201cdesigned to avoid the need for air conditioning, even in very, very high temperatures.\u201d \u201cWe are on the brink of a precipice. Everyone, including the athletes, must be aware of this,\u201d Hidalgo said. \u201cWe have to trust the scientists when they help us to construct buildings in a sober way that allows us to make do without air conditioning.\u201d CNN\u2019s Saskya Vandoorne and Derek Van Dam contributed to this report", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/style/paris-2024-olympic-village/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_style_francis-bacon-painting-recovered-intl-scli", "text": "Spanish police said on Thursday they had recovered a painting by the late Irish-born British figurative artist Francis Bacon, worth an estimated \u20ac5 million ($5.42 million), and one of five stolen from a Madrid home in 2015. The 1989 \u201cStudy for Portrait of Jos\u00e9 Capelo\u201d is the fourth painting to be recovered of the group, which is estimated to be worth a combined \u20ac25 million. In February, police arrested two people accused of the receipt of stolen artworks in the Spanish capital, leading them to ultimately discover the painting at a property in Madrid. Since the investigation began, 16 people believed to have masterminded and carried out the robbery have been arrested, police said in a statement. Three of the paintings were\u00a0recovered in 2017.

According to local media, the paintings were stolen from the apartment of Jos\u00e9 Capelo, Bacon\u2019s friend and former lover, although police would not confirm or deny that information. Dublin-born Bacon, who died in Madrid in 1992, was one of the most acclaimed artists of the 20th century, known for his disturbing vision of the human body.

The 3.3 million square-meter Al Khuwair Muscat Downtown and Waterfront development will include a residential complex, a marina, a cultural district, numerous canal walkways and a ministerial campus. Work is set to start at the end of this year and the area is expected to house more than 60,000 people when completed. ZHA\u2019s associate director, architect Paolo Zilli, told CNN he spent around a year finalizing the model he presented to Oman\u2019s Ministry of Housing and Urban Planning. Central to ZIlli\u2019s design was facilitating access to public transport. \u201cThe vision is actually to remove all the cars, to remove all the fences and to create a campus of the ministry with many functions that can attract families and a new generation,\u201d he said. ZHA says it will encourage pedestrians by providing shading and passive cooling, and incorporate infrastructure to improve cycling safety. The use of onsite solar power will be \u201cmaximized\u201d and native plant species will be conserved and restored. Oman\u2019s economy has long depended on oil, but it is now investing heavily in real-estate projects to drive more foreign investment, and ultimately boost non-oil revenues, part of the country\u2019s National Vision 2040 strategy. In Muscat, the population is projected to increase from 1.5 million to 2.7 million by that year. \u201cThere are a lot of changes,\u201d Dr. Khalfan bin Saeed bin Mubarak al-Shueili, Oman\u2019s Minister of Housing and Urban Planning, told CNN. \u201cWe [are] going to change the economy based on talent and capability skills and maybe also the digital sector. \u201cIn Muscat itself, we anticipate the requirement of another 300,000 homes. And if we are doing good, then \u2026 this probably could expand to 600,000 homes.\u201d UK-based Zaha Hadid Architects is named after its storied founder, who in 2004 became the first woman to win architecture\u2019s highest honor, the Pritzker Prize.

{"id": "2024_06_21_style_gen-z-bridal-fashion-trends-bof", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 Just an hour after getting engaged in Venice, Italy last year, Christyne de Quesada began scouring the internet for white dresses to wear to her many upcoming wedding-related events: An engagement party, a bachelorette weekend, a civil ceremony at a courthouse and a bigger celebration in Mexico City. But the Miami-based human resources manager had a hard time finding good quality, under $1,000 ensembles that reflected her personality. \u201cIt actually drove me a bit crazy,\u201d de Quesada said. \u201cI bought about seven things and returned all of them.\u201d Instead, she decided to look beyond classic bridal wear brands and retailers. She eventually settled on an ivory two-piece set by Shanghai-based label ShuShu Tong, which she bought from the e-tailer Ssense, for her civil ceremony, a Vera Wang gown she describes as \u201ctraditional and very princess-like\u201d for her Mexico City wedding ceremony and a bespoke ivory skirt and corset set by Florida-based bridal designer Gabriella Arango, complete with Gucci shoes, for the reception. Millennial and Gen-Z brides-to-be like de Quesada are no longer shopping for just a wedding dress, but an entire wardrobe for pre- and post-wedding events. That breadth is propelling the global bridal wear market, which is projected to grow at a rate of 3.5 percent annually and is expected to reach $83.5 billion by 2030, according to the Global Bridal Wear Market Industry report. But it\u2019s not companies like David\u2019s Bridal (which filed for bankruptcy and sold to Cion Investment Corp last year) that are benefitting. In order to find less cookie-cutter ensembles that are more reflective of their personal style, this new generation of brides are shopping outside the traditional bridal market. \u201cThe bridal industry is very much like an old boys club. They live by \u2018If it\u2019s not broken, don\u2019t fix it\u2019 and are very comfortable with the limited options that they\u2019ve given you,\u201d said Caroline Crawford Patterson, a bridal stylist and designer. \u201cWhat they don\u2019t realize is that the consumer is different and there\u2019s a big opportunity to shake things up.\u201d New opportunities in the bridal market After the industry was brought largely to a halt in 2020, weddings returned to pre-pandemic levels last year, with couples hosting over 2 million parties\u00a0, according to The Wedding Report. But the post-pandemic bridal wear landscape is remarkably different. Historically, brides have been limited to independent boutiques, department stores and chains like David\u2019s Bridal. Now, though, brides-to-be are open to wearing any white dress and are casting a wider net. It\u2019s an evolution of a space that was stagnant for a long time. \u201cSalons could get away with offering dresses that weren\u2019t chic or suited the fashion-forward bride or weren\u2019t size inclusive and the consumer, who is already spending a lot of money, just had to bear it,\u201d said Crawford Patterson, who got married in 2021. Anthropologie was one of the first non-bridal retailers to enter the space with the launch of its Bhldn line in 2011. (It\u2019s now called Anthropologie Weddings.) Today, Reformation, Abercrombie & Fitch and Revolve all offer wedding edits on their websites, as does The RealReal. Even fast fashion brands like ASOS, Forever 21, Lulus and Shein are increasing the number of bridal styles they carry. It\u2019s not just mass retail taking advantage. New York-based designer Jackson Wiederhoeft launched a made-to-order bridal segment in 2020 and now spends up to a year and a half developing wedding dresses for clients including initial appointments, fittings, alterations and advising. Despite the investment in time and resources, Wiederhoeft says the effort is \u201cworth it,\u201d as they get to develop an intimate relationship with consumers. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a dress for many people, it is the dress,\u201d said Wiederhoeft. For an emerging designer like Wiederhoeft, bridal is something of a safety net, serving as \u201ca floating line of credit\u201d for the rest of their business. With bridal, Wiederhoeft is able to collect 100 percent of the garment\u2019s cost upfront and directly from the client in order to pay for production, material and overhead costs. A Wiederhoeft wedding dress can cost between $3,000 and $25,000 for ready-to-wear bridal garments; pricing for custom dresses starts at $25,000. And unlike ready-to-wear, the brand\u2019s bridal segment is not subject to discounting. \u201cSome of the garments I made in my apartment four years ago are still in our showroom. I still use them as sale samples, and the styles are quite evergreen,\u201d they said. \u201cWhereas ready-to-wear has the shelf life of an avocado.\u201d What today\u2019s brides want \u2014 and don\u2019t As younger Millennials and Gen-Zers, the oldest of whom turn 27 this year, approach the altar, their ceremonies can differ greatly from previous generations, including their parents. (According to the US Census Bureau, the average American woman is 28.6 years old when they get married and the average American man is 30.5 years old.) Young people today are more likely to support same-sex and interracial marriage, enter into non-traditional relationships such as polyamory, and are more likely to forgo marriage entirely in favor of cohabiting with a partner long-term, according to research from Pew Research Center. \u201cSome of my clients are trying to push against the grain of conventional weddings and are focused on spending money on a house,\u201d said Hillary Taymour, founder and creative director of Collina Strada, who said her clients are looking to splurge on pieces that can be re-worn. Taymour said that today\u2019s brides believe \u201canything can be a wedding outfit.\u201d Her clients are opting for colorful designs and unconventional jewelry, including the brand\u2019s frog ring, which typically retails for $80, that couples have commissioned as engagement or wedding bands to mark the occasion. Catering to a broader spectrum of bridal wear can be beneficial even for a business with a historic focus in the sector, said Andrew Kwon, founder and creative director of his namesake label. He launched an eveningwear line alongside bridal in 2022. \u201cOne of the main challenges with bridal is the lack of repeat clients,\u201d said Kwon. \u201cTapping into eveningwear and colored dress has allowed me to bring in non-traditional brides, their bridesmaids and even their mothers into the fold.\u201d Retailers hoping to capture this new, forward-thinking bridal consumer are updating their assortment to reflect changing attitudes towards weddings. Last month, e-commerce retailer Ssense launched its second \u201canti-bridal\u201d capsule collection which featured unorthodox gowns, flower girl dresses and accessories. \u201cWe speak to an audience that\u2019s very open-minded and fluid,\u201d said Brigitte Chartrand, vice president of womenswear buying and the Everything Else segment at Ssense. \u201cThe products we commissioned didn\u2019t feel necessarily classic \u2026 it brings that differentiation of what bridal could be.\u201d This article was originally published by\u00a0The Business of Fashion, an editorial partner of CNN Style.
