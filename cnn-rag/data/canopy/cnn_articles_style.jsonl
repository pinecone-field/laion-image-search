{"id": "2024_05_15_style_priscilla-queen-of-the-desert-costumes", "text": "Sydney, 1994. A dimly-lit bar, wrapped in tinsel curtains and the fragmented, twirling light from a disco ball. Tick Belrose (played by Hugo Weaving) is on stage lip syncing as his drag persona Mitzi Del Bra; clad in a silver sequin dress with matching gloves and a bouffant blonde wig. This is the opening scene from \u201cThe Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert\u201d, which first screened at Cannes Film Festival 30 years ago this month. \u201cI made that dress for myself,\u201d Tim Chappel, one of the movie\u2019s costume designers, told CNN. \u201cThe weekend before, I\u2019d gone to the Miss Teen USA beauty pageant as Miss Silicon Valley, because (the dress) had joke plastic boobs inside. Stephan (Elliott, the film\u2019s writer and director) was really on my case because I wanted to do lots of obscure stuff (to costume the film\u00a0), and he wanted (the principal characters in drag) \u00a0to look like ladies. So I said we can make him look like a lady and take the piss at the same time, because the boobs are clearly from a party shop. And I\u2019d already made it, so it was cheap!\u201d In the film, Tick scoops up his freshly widowed friend Bernadette Bassenger (played by Terence Stamp) and flamboyant, fellow drag queen Adam Whitley/ Felicia Jollygoodfellow (actor Guy Pearce) and goes west \u2014 both musically and literally \u2014 for a road trip across the Outback in their affectionately-christened bus: Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. \u201cWe were just having a laugh!\u201d Chappel said, recalling the film\u2019s production. Sydney 30 years ago was at a unique point in time and culture; not yet tethered to the rest of the world via the internet, the somewhat isolated drag scene was able to cultivate its own sprawling visual language for storytelling and sexual politics, beyond the more recognizable female impersonation that Elliott might have initially pushed for. \u201cIt was my first opportunity to really express myself as a designer, and I wasn\u2019t going to let anybody stand in my way,\u201d Chappel said. \u201cI just really wanted to make (the film\u2019s wardrobe) unique and interesting.\u201d Serving looks, on a budget Film critic Susan Barber, despite calling out the problematic handling of female and non-white characters, dubbed \u201cPriscilla\u201d the \u201cdarling\u201d of the Cannes Film Festival after it premiered there in 1994. The film quickly drew attention for its costuming in particular, winning Chappel and fellow designer Lizzy Gardiner an Oscar in 1995. Among many iconic looks is the flip-flop (or \u2018thong,\u2019 if you\u2019re Australian) dress. It was made from shoes Chappel bought for $15 in Target using his mother\u2019s staff discount \u2014 \u201cwhich was good,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause that was about three quarters of our budget.\u201d Their mandated thriftiness meant that several costumes, \u201cmade with hot glue, chicken wire and duct tape\u201d, fell apart not long after the cameras stopped rolling. The flip-flop dress survived, though \u2014 that was made with cable ties, as well as duct tape. Two years passed between Chappel first joining the project and its (limited) funding being secured. The time allowed him to play with and re-do ideas, evolving initial plans into their extravagant final form. In one scene, for instance, Tick, Adam and Bernadette put on a fireside performance of Gloria Gaynor\u2019s \u201cI Will Survive\u201d for a group of First Nations people. Rather than mimic Gaynor\u2019s hairstyle directly, however, Chappel spent his elongated preparation time adding an increasing bouquet of flowers to the trio\u2019s headpieces, until eventually there was no hair left at all. \u201cI think that\u2019s definitely one of the most iconic looks,\u201d drag artist and costumer Philmah Bocks told CNN. Bocks has been designing costumes for 30 years, having broken into the drag scene around the same time \u201cPriscilla\u201d was hitting screens. \u201cThe thong dress is a very iconic piece too, because I think that\u2019s very (stereotypically) Australian. And of course the big finale look, with the emus on top of their heads. That\u2019s the beauty of \u2018Priscilla\u2019: they\u2019ve really captured a moment in Australian time and used Australian culture and flora and fauna to create these wonderful pieces.\u201d \u201cThe art of drag costuming is the ability to turn drab into fab,\u201d she continued. \u201c\u2019Priscilla\u2019 showed us a lot of that, because a lot of that type of design work was happening in and around Sydney in the early \u201890s. There was this sort of explosion of drag costuming that went beyond couture. Of course, queens were also on a budget. You couldn\u2019t always afford hundreds or even thousands of dollars to create the most beautiful pieces, but you could kind of get there with stuff we found in a dumpster! It\u2019s what you do with it that makes the difference\u2026 I\u2019ve been replicating (Chappel\u2019s) costumes for 30 years, so I\u2019ve got a lot to thank him for!\u201d Bocks is known for her foam, or \u2018Phoam\u2019, wigs, a look also popularized in \u201cPriscilla\u201d which she\u2019s made for London\u2019s hit musical \u201cPriscilla the Party!\u201d as well as for Katy Perry on an episode of \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d. These creations also follow the \u201cdrab to fab\u201d ethos: they\u2019re made from materials bought at the hardware store. \u201cI remember buying this product from the hardware store knowing full well that it was going on Katy Perry\u2019s head, and that made me laugh a little,\u201d Bocks said. \u201cOf course, by the time I\u2019d finished with it, it looked nothing like it had originally.\u201d Spirit of Ecstasy Perhaps more so than any other costume, the enduring image from \u201cPriscilla\u201d is Adam/ Felicia\u2019s opera performance atop the moving bus, decked out in hundreds of meters of flowing silver lam\u00e9. Its inspiration came from the Rolls Royce \u201cSpirit of Ecstasy\u201d bonnet ornament, though once again the final product went far beyond the script\u2019s guidance. Felicia\u2019s windswept aria comes after their bus is scrawled in homophobic graffiti \u2014 a reflection of the community\u2019s resilience against hate and disaster in real life. \u201cPriscilla\u201d received her standing ovation at Cannes seven months before Australia decriminalized homosexuality at federal level; three years before Tasmania would become the final state to pass similar legislation, and at a time when the AIDS crisis was still at large. Despite that, Chappel remembers the film as coming at a positive turning point: new HIV treatments were being trialed, replacing toxic doses of the AZT drug that had previously been offered. \u201cAll of a sudden there was hope. Out of the blue,\u201d he said. \u201c\u201cPriscilla\u201d, I think, captures that energy of everybody coming back to life.\u201d Stephan Elliott has recently announced that a sequel to \u201cPriscilla\u201d is in the works, with Chappel on board. The newest addition to the empire will join \u201cPriscilla\u2019s\u201d musical adaptation, which has toured the globe in Chappel\u2019s costumes since 2006. The film\u2019s legacy can also be seen in Australia\u2019s drag scene today and, since 2021, has been broadcast to new audiences via contestants on \u201cRupaul\u2019s Drag Race Down Under\u201d. \u201cIf I get run over by a bus tomorrow,\u201d Chappel said, \u201cthe last little thought that goes through my head \u2013 besides \u2018ouch\u2019 \u2013 is going to be \u2018I\u2019ve left an impression, that\u2019s cool\u2019.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/style/priscilla-queen-of-the-desert-costumes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_03_style_first-luxury-watch-buyer-guide", "text": "Navigating the world of \u201chaute horologie,\u201d the highest form of watchmaking, can be intimidating for a beginner. If you\u2019ve found yourself in the enviable position of shopping for your first luxury timepiece, you will likely have more questions than answers. From understanding the terminology, to knowing where to shop, the questions to ask yourself before you set foot in a store (or auction house) and how to avoid buying a fake, CNN Style has done the research and asked experts for their top tips. 1. Learn the lingo Just like buying a car, there are some technical terms prospective watch buyers can benefit from knowing. Here are a few: a. Parts of the watch  Crown: Small knob found on the side of the watch used to change the date and time. On a manual watch, the knob is used to wind it so the movement keeps going. Movement: The complex mechanisms that make the watch run.\u00a0 Bezel: The frame that holds in place the crystal protecting the watch face. Lug: The parts that connect the watch case to the bracelet (strap). Complication: A watch function beyond regular time-telling. Sometimes watches can have several added \u201ccomplications.\u201d For example, a chronograph has a stopwatch, while one with a perpetual calendar shows the month and day of the week, and a GMT tells the time across multiple time zones.\u00a0 Skeleton: A watch that showcases rather than covers up its inner workings. Tourbillon: An additional mechanism said to improve the accuracy of a watch. Most modern-day watches do not need a tourbillon to be highly accurate, but the complicated mechanism often pushes the price up.\u00a0 Quartz movement: Battery-powered watch. Automatic movement: A mechanical watch that does not need a battery to move, it relies on movement from the wearer to wind. b. Other useful terms Grey market: distribution or selling channels not officially authorized by the original manufacturer like forums, Instagram or Facebook marketplace. Reference: Model number that can tell you details about the watch; what it\u2019s made of, the design specifications etc.  Blue-chip brands: Well-known and reputable watchmaker brands like Patek Philippe, Cartier, Rolex and Vacheron Constantin with history and a track record of producing excellent timepieces. 2. Decide if you want a new or pre-owned watch Are you looking for the latest model from a trending brand, or are you interested in investing in a piece of history, or a timeless classic? If it\u2019s a new release, bear in mind these often come with a lot of fanfare \u2014 and a long waiting list \u2014 so you may find yourself lusting after a watch that simply can\u2019t be purchased within the timeframe you\u2019d like. Luxury watchmakers often require buyers to effectively \u201cprove\u201d their commitment to buying a popular model by requiring them to buy less coveted models before they can purchase the watch of their dreams \u2014 which can have waiting lists that can be months or years long, said the head of Sotheby Asia\u2019s watches department Joey Luk.Some, like independent watchmaker Charles Frodsham & Co. she adds, have a more than 10 year wait. \u201cDon\u2019t bother with it,\u201d said Hong Kong-based co-founder of The Horology Club Johnathan Chan, of the expectation for shoppers to buy watches they don\u2019t need to ultimately be able to get what they want. Given the time and money involved, he believes it makes more financial sense to pay a slight premium for a watch from a reputable second-hand dealer with clear provenance. If you are open to buying second hand, there\u2019s a thriving pre-owned luxury watch market out there, but be aware of the risks if you\u2019re not working with a trusted dealer who is able to certify the authenticity of the timepiece pre-sale. Think carefully about where you are shopping. An unknown, first-time seller on Facebook marketplace will likely warrant more scrutiny than a well-established dealer with a long list of previous customers who can vouch for them. Auction houses such as Christies and Sotheby\u2019s have in-house experts tasked with vetting the watches that they take in, and newer second-hand platforms such as Chrono 24 verify all the dealers on their site. This doesn\u2019t mean fakes don\u2019t make it onto the market, so you must do your research and \u2014 if possible \u2014 get the watch verified by the brand directly before completing the purchase. But if you\u2019d rather not take on any risk, going direct to a retailer may be your best bet. Away from the trending new models, there are of course plenty of good quality watches to be purchased direct from the maker. \u201cAt least you know there\u2019s someone to go to if anything goes wrong,\u201d said The Horology Club co-founder Helbert Tsang. 3. Buy a watch for the right reasons and consider what you need from it Don\u2019t get sucked into hype around a watch. This is a personal investment that you\u2019ll likely want to love wearing for a long time. Also, be careful if resale value is your main motivation. Tim Stracke, founder and chairman of leading watch resale platform Chrono24 said,\u201cI always (advise) don\u2019t first of all look at the financial returns,\u201d he said during an interview at the Watches and Wonders Fair in Geneva earlier this month. \u201cLook at the emotional return; what do you really like, what makes you smile every time you look at a piece?\u201d Sotheby\u2019s Luk agrees: \u201cAlways pick your favorite watch,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like the watch and you just bought that for investment, then it\u2019s going to be a waste, because it\u2019s going to sit in the safe forever.\u201d Ask yourself, what do I need the watch for? Is it something you\u2019ll wear to play tennis or to time your swim laps? In which case you may want a sturdy, waterproof, sports watch with a high degree of accuracy, said Luk. Maybe you\u2019re in the market for an elegant dress watch to wear to a wedding or you\u2019re looking for a mechanical masterpiece or a conversation-starter with a unique design. Are you shopping for an anniversary or birthday present for someone special? Perhaps select a model from a year that holds sentimental value. Luk also advises first-time buyers stick with established blue-chip brands that have a longstanding history. \u201cThey have a better reputation for quality and there is more info. on the market \u2013 it would be easier for beginners to do their research, check their historic prices and compare to the recent results,\u201d she told CNN via text message. These brands, she wrote are \u201cmore reliable and the prices are relatively stable,\u201d compared to lesser-known brands \u201cwhere there is limited info. online and it\u2019s difficult to monitor the price.\u201d 4. Try it on. Comfort is key Avoid buying anything you can\u2019t try on yourself. Just because a watch looks good in an advert or on a celebrity\u2019s wrist, it might not suit you. Watches can look very different in real life. Collector Carlos Pang, another co-founder of The Horology Club, found this with the Patek 3940. \u201cIt\u2019s a 36mm diameter watch, which for a lot of people might be a bit small, looking at the specs. But, once you try it on, the way the case is (designed), it\u2019s a bit fuller.\u201dAnd remember that you\u2019ll be wearing it for long stretches of the day, so comfort is essential. Consider the weight of the watch, and the material of the strap, for example. \u201cI definitely value wearability a lot,\u201d said Helbert Tsang. 5. Like a watch, but can\u2019t afford it? See if the designer made any others While on the lookout for a watch to wear to his wedding, Pang saw a six-figure Audemars Piguet watch. \u201cI really liked that watch\u2026 but at that time I didn\u2019t have much money,\u201d he said. Instead, he did his research and found the designer, in this case Gerald Genta, who had made watches for other brands that were more affordable. \u201cI went with the IWC Ingenieur in the end. I bought it secondhand and that\u2019s the watch I wore to my wedding. I still have that one today.\u201d 6. Take it slow Don\u2019t rush into the decision, in fact, it\u2019s sometimes best to shop without any real intention to buy, said Chan. \u201cGive yourself time to figure out and try different things, whether it\u2019s going to watch meets to check out watches, going to different stores, going to auction houses, but just experiencing more things so that you know yourself more and what you like.\u201d Watch enthusiast groups like The Horology Clubs organize meets where members bring timepieces from their collections to show and discuss. You can find the nearest one to you with a quick search on the internet and on social media. Chrono 24\u2019s Stracke adds:\u201cA watch purchase is often a purchase for life\u2026 don\u2019t mind taking the time even if it takes half a year, a year or even longer to find the piece you really want.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/03/style/first-luxury-watch-buyer-guide/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_style_new-miss-usa-crowned-hawaii-savannah-gankiewicz", "text": "Amid a dramatic two weeks of resignations and allegations made against the Miss USA organization, Miss Hawaii USA Savannah Gankiewicz \u2014 who had originally placed as the first runner-up at the 2023 Miss USA pageant \u2014 has stepped up to be crowned Miss USA. \u201cWhile this decision was not made lightly, I firmly believe that this opportunity was meant for me and I am ready to make a positive impact with this organization that I hold dear to my heart,\u201d said the 28-year-old, who was crowned by the governor of Hawaii Josh Green at a ceremony in Honolulu, Hawaii, on Wednesday. \u201cI am dedicated to taking action and making a difference. With my background as a certified mental health first aid responder and training in anti-bullying suicide prevention. I understand, the importance of prioritizing your well-being and advocating for those in need. I believe that the true change starts from within and I am determined to lead by example and empower the class of 2024 and beyond,\u201d she said, addressing a crowd in a hotel in Waikiki, a small aquarium in the background. Gankiewicz has taken over the title from Noelia Voigt, who suddenly gave up her crown earlier this month. Voigt cited her mental health as her reason for stepping down, but her resignation letter to the Miss Universe organization,\u00a0obtained\u00a0by CNN, accused CEO Laylah Rose, of \u201cactively building a culture of fear and control.\u201d Among her claims, she wrote that Miss USA management often failed to provide her with travel accommodations or an \u201ceffective handler,\u201d the latter leading to an instance where Voigt says she was sexually harassed during a Christmas parade in Sarasota, Florida, while alone with an unnamed person in a car. The Miss Universe organization and Rose, through Miss USA, did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Two days after Voigt\u2019s resignation, Miss Teen USA 2023 UmaSofia Srivastava relinquished her title as well, writing on Instagram that her values \u201cno longer fully align with the direction of the organization.\u201d In her first official appearance since the controversy, Rose did not address any of the allegations. She welcomed Gankiewicz to the Miss USA family telling her to \u201cembrace this moment of influence and let your words carry the power of positive change,\u201d and thanked her corporate partners and sponsors for their \u201cunwavering support.\u201d Rose said that this year\u2019s Miss Teen USA and Miss USA pageants would take place in Los Angeles and would broadcast on the CW network. The CW announced a multi-year agreement to air the two pageants in April, but in light of recent allegations, USA Today reported Monday that the network was \u201cevaluating\u201d its relationship with the Miss USA organization. The CW did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Tumult and turnover Currently, the Miss Teen USA role remains unfilled. The first runner-up from 2023, New York\u2019s Stephanie Skinner, declined to be crowned in a public statement on Instagram. On Tuesday, Voigt and Srivastava\u2019s mothers spoke out on \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d saying their daughters remained under strict non-disclosure agreements in their contracts and could not talk about their experiences. \u201cThe job of their dreams turned out to be a nightmare,\u201d Barbara Srivastava said. \u201cThe girls decided to step down and give (up) their dream of a lifetime \u2014 a crown, a national title. Why would two girls decide to give that up?\u201d During their reigning year, she added, their daughters were \u201cill-treated, abused, bullied and cornered,\u201d she added. Miss USA and Miss Universe Organization have not returned CNN\u2019s multiple requests for comment. Though many current Miss USA state titleholders expressed their public support on Instagram following Voigt\u2019s resignation, this week, the reigning Miss Colorado USA, Arianna Lemus, gave up her title completely. \u201cMy values were compromised. Silencing women is not the definition of pageantry,\u201d she told CNN on Wednesday. \u201cAs a collective, the 2023 (Miss USA) class came together in solidarity with Noelia, but that wasn\u2019t enough for me\u2026 and that\u2019s why I resigned.\u201d Gankiewicz will only hold the Miss USA title for a few months this summer, until a new contestant from the 2024 class of state titleholders takes the national crown in August at the next Miss USA pageant. On Instagram, she had acknowledged the limitations of her role, saying, \u201cWith the little time I have as Miss USA, it is my intention to bring attention and focus onto the rebuilding of Lahaina on my island of Maui. I also look forward to helping the 2024 delegates transition into a new era of Miss USA and supporting them on their own journeys towards the crown.\u201d Lemus, meanwhile, called on urgent action to protect 2024 titleholders and beyond from restrictive contracts. Voigt\u2019s mother, Jackeline Voigt, said on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d that contestants should reconsider competing at all. \u201cLook at what happened to Noelia and UmaSofia,\u201d she said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s not the right time to participate.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/style/new-miss-usa-crowned-hawaii-savannah-gankiewicz/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}

The brainchild of Lithuanian artist Benediktas Gylys, \u201cthe Portal\u201d was unveiled on Wednesday and allows people on either side of the Atlantic to interact with each other via a video link. New Yorkers can head to Flatiron South Public Plaza at Broadway, Fifth Avenue, and 23rd Street, next to the Flatiron Building, to see people on Dublin\u2019s O\u2019Connell Street on the 24/7 visual livestream, according to a Wednesday press release. The idea was \u201cconceived as a testament to the power of art to transcend physical barriers,\u201d reads the press release from Gylys and officials from New York City and Dublin. It will remain in place through fall this year, according to the release, with a number of cultural performances scheduled to take place in front of the installations in both cities. \u201cPortals are an invitation to meet people above borders and differences and to experience our world as it really is \u2014 united and one,\u201d said\u00a0Gylys in the statement. \u201cThe livestream provides a window between distant locations, allowing people to meet outside of their social circles and cultures, transcend geographical boundaries, and embrace the beauty of global interconnectedness.\u201d The lord mayor of Dublin, Daith\u00ed de R\u00f3iste, said he is aiming to make the Irish capital more inclusive. \u201cThe Portals project embodies this, bringing together technology, engineering and art to bring communities from across the world closer together and to allow people to meet and connect outside of their social circles and cultures,\u201d he said. The installations are the latest in a series of portals built by Gylys, with the first pair opening in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius and the Polish city of Lublin in 2021. The Dublin portal will also connect with other installations in Lithuania and Poland from July onwards, said de R\u00f3iste in the statement. This is not the first time that an artist has brought New Yorkers closer to people across the Atlantic. In 2008, British artist Paul St. George linked the city with London via his Telectroscope, which similarly allowed people in New York to communicate visually with those in the British capital. However, in this case the device responsible was a Telectroscope, a brass and wood device which measured an 11.2-meter-(37 feet) long by 3.3-meter-(11 feet) tall.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/style/art-installation-dublin-new-york-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_04_20_style_park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli", "text": "Everyone knows the familiar shapes that make up New York\u2019s skyline. There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}

The design was upcycled from vintage Chanel scarves by stylist Logan Horne, whose brand, J. Logan Home, specializes in refashioning heritage luxury accessories. His pieces, which retail at close to $3,000 each, have also been worn by the musicians Dua Lipa and 2 Chainz and are sold at stores including Farfetch, Kith and The Webster. They\u2019ve also caught the attention of the French luxury giant\u2019s legal department. In February, lawyers acting for Chanel sent Horne a cease and desist letter, demanding his label stop selling products bearing its logo and other brand signifiers. It\u2019s the latest in a flurry of cases that have turned upcycling into an emerging legal battle ground, pitting a practice that\u2019s been pitched as key to improving the industry\u2019s sustainability credentials against the established bounds of trademark protection. \u201cWe really have these two values that point in different directions,\u201d said Fashion Law Institute founder Susan Scafidi. \u201c(Upcycling) is absolutely risky, despite the fact that it is trending and ethical.\u201d Why is upcycling controversial? Chanel\u2019s objection to J. Logan Home\u2019s designs isn\u2019t exactly a bolt from the blue. Major luxury players have historically been wary of the secondary market, concerned it could damage their carefully controlled hold on brand distribution and image, cannibalize sales and encourage counterfeiting. It\u2019s a tension that has played out prominently over the last decade thanks to the rapid rise of online resale platforms. Though some brands have begun to tentatively embrace the space, others have remained cautious. Chanel, in particular, has pursued high-profile cases against re-commerce players it argues are using its brand without permission and selling fakes. (The brand scored a major win earlier this year, when a New York court awarded it $4 million in damages in its suit against the resale business What Goes Around Comes Around. A separate legal dispute with The RealReal is ongoing.) Smaller-scale upcycling has attracted less attention so far. But the practice has become more widespread, driven in part by demand for logo-heavy streetwear, greater access to vintage products and deadstock fabrics and a growing desire among young designers to operate sustainably. That\u2019s given rise to an increasing number of trademark and copyright infringement complaints targeting upcyclers from brands including Louis Vuitton and Levi\u2019s, as well as Chanel. In 2022, Louis Vuitton secured a $603,000 pay out and permanent injunction in a Texas case against a business selling refashioned Vuitton products. Last year, Levi\u2019s brought a complaint against French label Coperni, alleging it was using pocket stitching and fabric tabs confusingly similar to the famed denim label. The sale of such products, alongside items that had actually been upcycled from Levi\u2019s jeans without authorization, created additional risk of consumer confusion, the company argued. Both brands declined to comment when reached by Business of Fashion. Does upcycling infringe on brands\u2019 trademarks? The disputes reflect legitimate trademark and copyright concerns, but they also raise questions over how far these protections should stretch when they conflict with broader sustainability goals, according to legal experts. \u201cIt is a grey area within the law,\u201d said Scafidi. \u201cBrands absolutely have a legal leg to stand on. The question is how well-clad it is.\u201d In general terms, once a brand has sold an item, it becomes fair game to be resold or redistributed by third parties. But this principle, known as the first-sale doctrine or trademark exhaustion, may not apply if an item has been reworked or embellished, lawyers said. Upcyclers can take precautions, like avoiding the prominent use of logos, or providing consumers with clear disclosures that reworked products are not authorized or affiliated with the brands they reference (an approach J. Logan Home adopted). But these steps still may not be sufficient to counter arguments of copyright or trademark infringement, according to lawyers. And while the legal frameworks protecting companies\u2019 intellectual property are well established, whether the sustainability benefits of upcycling should be weighed against these hasn\u2019t really been tested. \u201cIf we want to move from a linear to a circular economy, we need to upcycle,\u201d said Irene Calboli, a professor of law at Texas A&M University. \u201cThe fact that intellectual property law gets in the way of those who want to upcycle or recycle is just wrong.\u201d Chanel said it is paying close attention to sustainability matters, pointing to its work with L\u2019Atelier des Mati\u00e8res, which recycles unsold items and deadstock from luxury and premium brands. \u201c(Upcycling is) a positive trend that we continue to explore, and we have always been conscious of the need to strike a balance between protecting the rights of our brand and the rights of others to create and trade freely,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cHowever, the use of elements stamped with the Chanel logo is sometimes simply an unauthorized misappropriation of our trademarks\u2026 in such cases, we take the action we deem appropriate to protect our rights.\u201d The wider legal crackdown hasn\u2019t only targeted brands making prominent use of logos either. Before she became a celebrated New York designer, Batsheva Hay worked as a copyright lawyer. So it was a shock when she found herself on the receiving end of a cease and desist letter from a large commercial brand over a short run of dresses made from deadstock fabric sourced from India. Though it bore no obvious logo, as it turned out, the print she used had been made for a bigger player who didn\u2019t want to see it reproduced elsewhere. \u201cI was really humiliated and horrified because I thought it was some cool vintage fruit print and it turned out to be some kind of junky commercial print,\u201d said Hay. Rather than take on the time and expense of fighting the case, she just took the remaining three dresses she hadn\u2019t yet sold off her site. What does this mean for the future of upcycling? Horne says he can\u2019t afford to fight Chanel, which has threatened to seek statutory damages of $2 million per mark, disgorgement of all profits and payment of its attorney\u2019s fees if he doesn\u2019t stop selling products carrying the company\u2019s branding, according to a copy of the letter reviewed by Business of Fashion. Instead, he said he\u2019s looking at to pivot his brand while continuing to find creative ways to address the industry\u2019s issues with waste and over-production. The dream would be an opportunity to officially collaborate with an established label on an upcycled collection. \u201cAs much as I believe in my mission\u2026 I\u2019m not trying to go bankrupt going to battle with Chanel,\u201d he said. Industry watchers say the current flurry of cases reflect a broader adjustment to emerging new models. Some big brands, like Prada, Gucci and indeed Levi\u2019s, have already dabbled with upcycling collections and programs of their own. Anna Foster, who runs the refashioned brand E.L.V. Denim, has partnered with companies including Gabriela Hearst and The Outnet to help upcycle excess inventory. These days, she says she\u2019s having about a conversation a week with brands interested in exploring collaboration, but the industry moves slowly. Meanwhile, politics may be moving at a faster speed, creating different challenges for brands. Both consumers and policy makers are increasingly aware of the huge levels of waste generated by the fashion industry, with new regulations that would make brands more responsible for dealing with old clothes and excess inventory in the pipeline in both Europe and the US. \u201cWe really are at an inflection point where we might have a result in court that is different from the result in the court of social media,\u201d said Scafidi. \u201cIt\u2019s that tension that really needs to be resolved.\u201d This article was originally published by\u00a0The Business of Fashion, an editorial partner of CNN Style.

{"id": "2024_03_29_style_kim-kardashian-donald-judd-furniture-cec", "text": "Kim Kardashian\u2019s oft-divisive interior design aesthetic is under new scrutiny. The estate of minimalist contemporary artist Donald Judd filed a lawsuit against Kardashian this week, claiming the fashion and beauty mogul promoted \u201ccheap knockoffs\u201d of his furniture designs. The basis of the suit is a 2022 video Kardashian posted to YouTube, in which she gives a guided tour of the offices for her then-brand new makeup company, Skkn by Kim. (The video, which the suit alleged received some 3.7 million views, was seemingly made private following the lawsuit filing.) While touting her office\u2019s minimalist design, Kardashian specifically praises a sleek, large-scale wooden table with a set of matching chairs that are perfectly sized to slide beneath \u2014 creating a piece resembling less a dining table and more a brutalist sculpture. \u201cThese Donald Judd tables are really amazing and totally blend in with the seats,\u201d Kardashian says, moving a chair out to show the camera. An artist and sculptor, Judd was known for his minimalist designs emphasizing clean whole shapes and industrial materials. As they appear in the video, the table and its matching chairs in Kardashian\u2019s office resemble Judd\u2019s famous La Mansana Table and Chair 84 \u2014 pieces that have become iconic among furniture designers and collectors since they were first produced in 1982. The Judd Foundation still manufactures and sells these designs, though they come at a cost: the table is priced at $90,000, while the chairs retail for $9,000 each. But Kardashian\u2019s wares were not authentic pieces, the Judd Foundation wrote in the lawsuit filed Wednesday against both Kardashian and Clements Design, the interior design firm she worked with in designing the Skkn office space. (And even if they were, the foundation \u201ccategorically prohibits customers from using purchased Donald Judd furniture for marketing and promotional purposes,\u201d it says in its court filing.) The foundation is claiming trademark infringement, copyright infringement, unfair competition, false advertising and false endorsement of the knockoff items. \u201cConsumers who watched the video or read the media coverage were misled to believe Ms. Kardashian\u2019s tables and chairs were authentic Donald Judd pieces,\u201d the foundation states in the filing. It is seeking the profits it argues Kardashian and Clements Design made off the use of Judd\u2019s name. Clements Designs, according to the court filing, said it never claimed the tables and chairs were authentic Judd pieces, and directed the foundation to settle the issue with Kardashian. In a statement provided to CNN, the design firm said the pieces it produced for Kardashian\u2019s office had \u201cobvious key differences\u201d to Judd\u2019s designs. \u201cThe Judd Foundation\u2019s prior counsel acknowledged these differences and since then, we have not heard from them in over a year, and are now being blindsided with a lawsuit,\u201d Clements Design\u2019s statement read. \u201cEfforts were made to resolve this issue amicably at the time and the Judd Foundation was unwilling to settle on reasonable terms. These claims have absolutely no merit.\u201d To add further insult, Kardashian\u2019s knockoffs were also, the lawsuit claims, seemingly made from plywood \u2014 a material that the Judd Foundation does not authorize.\u201d \u201cThese poor-quality imitations masquerading as authentic Donald Judd tables and chairs harm the Donald Judd brand,\u201d the lawsuit argues. \u201cConsumers will see the cheap knockoffs\u2026 and erroneously associate (the) low-grade pieces with the Donald Judd brand,\u201d the lawsuit states. The foundation claimed it also offered to replace the counterfeit tables and chairs with authentic pieces at a discount if Kardashian issued a retraction and edited the video, the lawsuit claims. Representatives for Kardashian offered to promote the Judd Foundation in a social media post, which the foundation rejected, and also offered to issue a retraction in the video caption, but not remove the video, the lawsuit claims. Kardashian did not respond to requests for comment from CNN. Judd, who died in 1994, was very selective about who was allowed to manufacture and carry his designs, paying particularly close attention to the quality of materials used. Only a few galleries and stores \u2014 like the MoMA Design store and the Salon 94 gallery, both in New York \u2014 are authorized to sell his furniture.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/29/style/kim-kardashian-donald-judd-furniture-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "style_article_moshe-safdie-architect-singapore", "text": "There are few buildings that have more drastically shaped a city\u2019s image than Marina Bay Sands. Just as the Eiffel Tower and Burj Khalifa define the skylines of Paris and Dubai, the soaring three-tower resort, joined across the top by a horizontal \u201cskypark\u201d and the world\u2019s most famous infinity pool, is an icon both in and of Singapore. In fact, the hotel-casino project is so successful that the man who designed it doesn\u2019t even stay there. \u201cIt\u2019s too noisy,\u201d said Israeli-Canadian architect Moshe Safdie. \u201cI\u2019m a swimmer and I can never get in the pool because there are so many people taking pictures.\u201d Now resuming his once-frequent trips to Singapore amid easing travel restrictions, Safdie prefers the nearby Ritz-Carlton, where we meet for afternoon tea. (\u201cI had a British mother,\u201d he explained, \u201cso I\u2019m a sucker for scones and tea.\u201d) At a top-floor table overlooking his best-known creation, he reflected on the sometimes-fraught task of designing contemporary landmarks. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t on my mind as much as it was on their minds,\u201d he clarified, recounting the call for design proposals issued by the city-state\u2019s government in the mid-2000s. \u201cThey didn\u2019t quite say the building should become the icon of Singapore, but they talked about it being iconic.  \u201cWhen we made the submission, I said, \u2018Some buildings have the magic to become memorable and associated with a place.\u2019 And I mentioned Sydney Opera House as the classic contemporary example. But, I said, \u2018It\u2019s a mystery what makes that happen.\u2019\u201d The trick, it transpired, was designing something striking yet simple. Constructing a 0.2-mile-long cantilevered roof terrace atop three skyscrapers required a feat of complex engineering but, at its most abstract, Marina Bay Sands can be sketched in four basic strokes. In Singapore Sign Language, the landmark is referenced by simply raising three fingers of one hand and resting another digit across the top. Visible for miles around, it appears on postcards and newscast backdrops. The structure also stars in the official Singapore Lego set, which the architect proudly displays at his office back in Somerville, Massachusetts.  \u201cThat kind of stuff, you can\u2019t quite plan for or design \u2013 it just happens,\u201d he said of the building\u2019s success. \u201cBut I\u2019m very happy about it. It changed our lives in terms of the work we get.\u201d  Safdie\u2019s eponymous firm is in high demand. In the years since Marina Bay Sands opened in 2010, he has realized almost 20 major projects. Among them are the serene Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas and a dual-tower residential complex in Colombo, Sri Lanka, that sees one high-rise lean dramatically against the other. The architect also bequeathed Singapore with another landmark in 2019: Jewel, a nature-themed entertainment and retail complex that attracts throngs of Instagrammers to Changi Airport each day thanks to its verdant indoor waterfall.  Safdie has said he considers seeing finished projects in use to be among an architect\u2019s greatest pleasures. He makes a point of visiting Jewel whenever he\u2019s in Singapore. \u201cI was concerned about how the plants were doing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I was relieved to see they\u2019re thriving.\u201d The architect is not in Singapore to indulge in past glories, however. In the days after our interview, he will inspect two new developments: a gardenesque office complex in the island\u2019s west and a pair of residential towers on the upmarket Orchard Road. The latter features multiple skybridges \u2013 a recurring theme in Safdie\u2019s work that was recently taken to new extremes in Chongqing, China, where he lay a gargantuan \u201chorizontal skyscraper\u201d (containing an infinity pool, restaurants and an indoor garden) atop four 820-foot-tall towers.   Then there is the small matter of Marina Bay Sands\u2019 second phase. The expansion plans feature, among other things, a fourth tower \u2013 though Safdie dismissed early suggestions that his iconic skypark might be extended to rest across its top. In any case, Singapore officials have expressed that he shouldn\u2019t, in his words, \u201cscrew around\u201d with an icon. Instead, the new tower will stand apart from the other three, forming \u201csort of an exclamation mark,\u201d he explained, motioning punctuative strokes: \u201cBoooom\u2026 boom.\u201d  Radical vision  At 84, Safdie shows little sign of slowing down. Other recent trips have taken him to Sao Paolo, Brazil, where his glass-roofed Albert Einstein Education and Research Center recently opened its doors, and to the Ecuadorian capital Quito, where his tree-covered Qorner Tower will do so later this year. Covid-19 eased the architect\u2019s unrelenting travel schedule, but he used the downtime to pen a memoir, \u201cIf Walls Could Speak: My Life in Architecture.\u201d He said he felt it was \u201ctime to document things.\u201d  Published this week, \u201cIf Walls Could Speak\u201d serves as a reminder that much of Safdie\u2019s six-decade career has been dedicated to humbler pursuits \u2013 museums, memorials and social housing that reimagined how people might live in densely populated cities.  Before Marina Bay Sands, his best-known project was his very first: Habitat 67, a radical 1960s housing development that saw hundreds of identical prefabricated concrete units stacked into clusters along Montreal\u2019s Saint Lawrence River. Safdie\u2019s dream that it would spark a wave of large-scale \u201cHabitats\u201d around the world proved overly optimistic. His attempts to repeat the feat in other cities, including New York, Toronto and Iran\u2019s capital Tehran, have often been thwarted. Projects of such size require land, funding and political will, and Safdie\u2019s book openly recounts times when all three were lacking. But the principles underpinning the experiment \u2013 that apartment dwellers should enjoy access to outdoor space, views in multiple directions and the opportunity to interact with nature and neighbors \u2013 defined his work thereafter. Born in 1938 in Haifa, then part of British-controlled Palestine, Safdie has credited much of this architectural ethos to his childhood. As a boy, he always lived in apartment buildings, first in a Bauhaus-style block on Haifa\u2019s Mount Carmel and then at his family\u2019s new home further up the hill. At the latter, he would enter via a bridge, while the famous Baha\u2019i Gardens \u201calmost functioned as my backyard,\u201d he writes in \u201cIf Walls Could Speak.\u201d One need not look far for the inspiration behind the skybridges and elevated urban gardens that have since characterized his oeuvre. Safdie moved to Canada with his parents aged 15. (In a neat turn of events, he departed Israel via Lod Airport, since renamed Ben Gurion Airport, where decades later he would design a terminal building.) It was in Montreal that Safdie decided to pursue architecture \u2013 and where he first grew his signature mustache. He attended the city\u2019s McGill University and wrote a college thesis, \u201cA Case for City Living,\u201d outlining his vision for a flexible housing \u201csystem\u201d that could be adapted to different contexts and climates. Those early ideas have long shaped Safdie\u2019s outlook. They would shape his fortunes, too. After showing his college drawings to the influential modernist Louis Kahn, he secured an apprenticeship at the architect\u2019s Philadelphia office. Soon after, he was offered the chance to put his ideas into practice at a scale unimaginable to most young graduates.  Montreal was due to host the 1967 World Fair, or Expo 67. Despite having never completed a building, the then 24-year-old Safdie was asked by the event\u2019s mastermind (and his thesis adviser), architect Sandy van Ginkel, to develop a master plan for the site. He was also tasked with building on his ideas, eventually proposing a village-sized development of some 1,200 prefabricated dwellings stacked 20 to 30 stories high. His meticulous placement of each factory-built module was calculated to maximize garden space, allow in sunlight and improve residents\u2019 views. Interconnected pedestrian walkways and bridges lifted the urban realm above ground.  Political and financial realities scaled back his design; the final Habitat 67 comprised just 154 apartments \u2013 made from 354 modules and stacked 12 stories high across three \u201cclusters.\u201d It was, nonetheless, a major statement. In a postwar world rethinking how to accommodate rapidly urbanizing populations, Safdie\u2019s system of repeated modular forms offered a bold new model for housing. Three of the 20th century\u2019s most important architects, I.M. Pei, Paul Rudolph and Philip Johnson, toured the project together prior to its opening. Only when Johnson told Safdie that he had \u201coutdone\u201d the classical Italian architect Giovanni Battista Piranesi did he realize the project \u201cwas a game changer,\u201d he recounted. Habitat 67 was not universally adored. A New Yorker cartoon, which Safdie also displays at his Boston office, poked \u201cgentle fun\u201d at the project by depicting a spade-wielding child stacking sand into similar formations. Various journalists and fellow architects were more barbed in their criticisms.  \u201cIt\u2019s strange that something so radical done by a young person gets so much crap thrown at it,\u201d Safdie mused. \u201cBut that\u2019s been true of my career.\u201d   \u2018For everyone a garden\u2019  To define Safdie\u2019s career by either his breakout success or the \u201cmegascale\u201d projects of recent years would be to ignore much else in between.  In the early 1970s, he opened an office in Jerusalem, a city whose urban fabric he has profoundly transformed. As well as designing major institutions like the Hebrew Union College and the Yad Vashem Holocaust History Museum, he oversaw a full-scale rebuild of the destroyed Jewish Quarter and planned an entirely new city, Modi\u2019in-Maccabim-Re\u2019ut, about 15 miles to its northwest. At one point, he even considered running for mayor of Jerusalem. He has also built widely in North America, where his output spans from the meditative (a nondenominational chapel at the Harvard Business School) to the mammoth (Terminal 1 of Toronto\u2019s Pearson Airport). A citizen of Israel, the US and Canada, Safdie may be best known in the latter for the National Gallery in Ottawa, a grand glass palace housing some of the country\u2019s most treasured art.  Despite earlier setbacks Safdie has, more recently, found fertile ground for his \u201cHabitats\u201d in Asia. In 2017, he completed the first phase of the sprawling Habitat Qinhuangdao \u2013 in the titular city, about 200 miles from Beijing \u2013 a series of 16-story \u201cmini blocks\u201d connected by garden bridges. Back in Singapore, Safdie\u2019s pixelated Sky Habitat tower saw him stretch his familiar stacked forms high above the ground to maximize floor space on a comparatively small plot. In both cases \u2013 and throughout Safdie\u2019s career \u2013 ideals articulated in the 1960s have been adapted to meet the realities of new sites and clients. Yet, the architect maintains that his approach to housing remains, fundamentally, the same. \u201cThe belief in apartments being rethought as houses, in having gardens for every apartment, in quality of life, in streets and communities and making buildings that belong to their culture \u2013 from the outset these were fundamental to my beliefs,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they haven\u2019t changed. If anything, they have reinforced themselves as years go by.\u201d \u201cI think, without bragging, there\u2019s been consistency,\u201d he added. \u201cIn fact, you could say I\u2019ve not been dynamic enough, but I\u2019ve been pretty consistent.\u201d  Idealism and compromise   There were other high-profile proposals that never came to fruition. Among the most divisive was the Columbus Center, a pair of heavy-set towers once set to loom over Manhattan\u2019s Central Park at Columbus Circle before plans were scrapped following 1987\u2019s Wall Street crash (and amid vociferous criticism from the likes of Henry Kissinger and Jacqueline Onassis).  But Safdie\u2019s legacy will not be measured only by what was, or wasn\u2019t, built. Many of the once-radical ideas he championed are now mainstream \u2013 something he can take an amount of credit for. For one, his fixation on plant life, a principle he dubbed \u201cfor everyone a garden\u201d in a 1974 book of the same name, is now widely shared by younger architects. Urban gardens and \u201cliving walls\u201d are now almost de rigueur for new large-scale developments.  Plants do not always thrive, though. In his memoir, Safdie distinguishes between \u201csignificant plant life\u201d and \u201csorry shrubs.\u201d So-called biophilic architecture may now be all the rage, but it can be undone by insufficient planning or maintenance, leaving occupants with dying trees and even bug infestations. As such, Safdie welcomes the trend while cautioning again token gestures. \u201cThe idea of green buildings is a battle cry \u2013 everyone is for it,\u201d he said. Making them work, however, is another matter altogether. \u201cThere\u2019s a cynicism about so many architects presenting buildings that are fairly conventional and then, in the renderings, everything is green and every balcony is oozing with trees. When you look (closer), you see there\u2019s no preparation for the earth, there\u2019s no depth \u2013 it\u2019s a fantasy.\u201d Prefabrication, championed by the architect since his college thesis, is also enjoying a renaissance. Just two miles away from Marina Bay Sands, for instance, a Singaporean design firm is overseeing two 630-foot-tall residential skyscrapers built from units constructed in a factory over the border in Malaysia.  \u201cFor a long time, people totally gave up on (prefabrication),\u201d Safdie said. \u201cBut now there is a real shortage of labor and skilled labor \u2013 not in China, because they\u2019ve got an extraordinary workforce, and not in India, but everywhere else in Southeast Asia, in Singapore, in the West. So, anything that is labor-saving is now up for grabs.\u201d Much else has changed since Safdie formed his architectural ideals. For one, he \u201cnever would have imagined\u201d how densely populated cities would become in the past 50 years. \u201cPrograms change, lifestyles change, priorities change and technologies change,\u201d the architect added.  But what about him? Has his outlook changed, too? \u201cMy daughter accused me of not being as idealistic as I was,\u201d the architect said. \u201cI disagree with her.\u201d Safdie is nonetheless aware that the lofty principles of his youth may not be shared by the casinos or corporate clients he often works for. Being an architect sometimes means serving \u201cregimes you\u2019re not in love with and business entities whose values are different to yours,\u201d he noted.  \u201cTake the dilemma I had with Marina Bay Sands,\u201d he said, motioning once more toward the window and our view of the complex from the Ritz-Carlton\u2019s lounge. \u201cOn the one hand, the idea of doing a building that could promote \u2018gaming\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s a nice word for it, but \u2018gambling\u2019 is the reality \u2013 is almost immoral if you go there and see poor people with limited means wasting their money.  \u201cBut, to me, that was 2% or 3% of the area of a project that\u2026 could show what the public realm could be in a city. And that took over from the issue that nagged me.  \u201cThat\u2019s compromise,\u201d he concluded. \u201cBut the basic value, the idealism of the end product, has not diminished. Without it, I don\u2019t know how you can be an architect.\u201d \u201cIf Walls Could Speak: My Life in Architecture,\u201d published by Grove Atlantic, is available now.", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/article/moshe-safdie-architect-singapore/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_03_27_style_titanic-door-prop-auction-planet-hollywood", "text": "It\u2019s one of the most iconic, and hotly-debated, props in cinematic history: The floating wood panel that spared Kate Winslet\u2019s \u201cTitanic\u201d character Rose DeWitt Bukater from icy North Atlantic waters after the titular ocean liner\u2019s sinking \u2014 but not Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s Jack Dawson. And it\u2019s now been sold at auction for more than $700,000. \u201cOften mistakenly referred to as a door, the ornate structure was in reality part of the door frame just above the first-class lounge entrance,\u201d Heritage Auctions wrote in the auction notes. The prop\u2019s pivotal role in the \u201cbig scene, big goodbye\u201d moment, as the auction house had described it, features Rose floating on the floral-carved panel as Jack, having tried and failed to also rest atop, has succumbed to the cold. As a rescue boat arrives, Rose is forced to pry her hand from his frozen grip \u2014 while uttering the famous line \u201cI\u2019ll never let go, I promise,\u201d through chattering teeth \u2014 as she swims to her rescuers. The ornate balsa wood panel had previously been displayed at a Planet Hollywood in Orlando, Florida before being stored in their archives for some two decades, the auction house told CNN. It was sold alongside a roster of other props at the \u201cTreasures From Planet Hollywood\u201d auction, which included memorabilia items once displayed at Planet Hollywood locations worldwide and from its archives. These included pieces such as the whip from\u00a0\u201cIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\u201d and the ax from \u201cThe Shining.\u201d Across almost 1,600 lots in total, the five-day-long auction brought in $15.7 million, according\u00a0to a press release. But the \u201cTitanic\u201d flotsam took the prize for the highest-priced piece, far exceeding its starting price of $40,000 and selling for a grand total of $718,750 following a high-energy bidding war. Several other \u201cTitanic\u201d props were also put up for sale, including the pastel chiffon evening gown Rose wears in the movie on the night of the sinking and the ship\u2019s helm wheel, which sold for $118,750 and $200,000 respectively. A 2012 episode of the Discovery show \u201cMythBusters\u201d infamously found that two people could have survived long enough on the panel \u2014 which measures approximately eight feet (2.4 meters) long and just over three feet (1 meter) wide \u2014 if they added a life jacket for extra buoyancy. Remarking on the results, however, \u201cTitanic\u201d director James Cameron told the show\u2019s hosts, Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage, that Jack needed to die regardless. And in 2022, Cameron, alongside a hypothermia expert, tried to put an end to the debate once and for all with a\u00a0simulated test\u00a0to see if two people of the same body mass as Winslet and DiCaprio could have really stayed afloat on a piece of wood of the same size. Their final answer was no, it was not possible. There was no additional testing of these theories on the prop itself prior to its sale, as the auction house chooses to \u201chandle all items with great care when in transit and in storage,\u201d Heritage Auctions told CNN. But its new owner, who is choosing to remain anonymous, could well be planning a pool day, having been drawn in by the allure of the over two-decade-long mystery. \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is this massive interest in the films of the 1980s and 1990s,\u201d said Joe Maddalena, executive vice president of Heritage Auctions, in a statement. \u201cThere has been a generational shift to where these massive franchises of the 1980s and 1990s \u2014 the \u2018Home Alone\u2019s, the \u2018Indiana Jones\u2019 films, the \u2018Die Hard\u2019s \u2014 are now collectors\u2019 favorites\u2026 Collectors are finally rewarding these artifacts as what they are: cultural artifacts akin to the fine art of old.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/style/titanic-door-prop-auction-planet-hollywood/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_04_17_style_copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl", "text": "Police launched an investigation Wednesday into the fire that tore through Copenhagen\u2019s famous stock exchange building, causing the collapse of its spire and damaging centuries-old artwork and architecture. The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through\u00a0the building \u2013 known locally as B\u00f8rsen \u2013\u00a0from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen\u00a0police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a \u201ccomplicated process.\u201d Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already \u201cconducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.\u201d \u201cBut of course, there is still a lot to do, especially as we have not yet had the opportunity to examine\u00a0B\u00f8rsen itself,\u201d Belling added. The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. \u201cMy first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be the same but it\u2019s iconic to\u00a0Copenhagen\u00a0and Denmark,\u201d teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters. Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, told the news agency that a firefighter gave him the top of the spire on Wednesday morning after it was recovered following its fall. \u201cIt gives me hope because we have decided to rebuild the stock exchange because it\u2019s part of European history as a trading continent,\u201d he said. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. It has been at the heart of Danish business since then; while it no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, it serves as the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday a \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d was on fire, calling the building \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt added that 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/17/style/copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}

On Saturday, stars gathered on the steps of The Music Center in Los Angeles for the Gold Gala \u2014 a celebration of Asian Pacific influential talent across entertainment, fashion, technology and more, hosted by the non-profit Gold House. And they were dressed to represent \u2014 many proudly embracing Asian designers and cultural heritage through their red carpet looks. Actor Karrueche Tran stunned in a striking red ao dai with a sheer overlay and headpiece by Vietnamese American fashion designer Thai Nguyen. \u201cI knew I had to represent my culture, half of who I am, in a major way,\u201d she wrote on Instagram. Tran has a Vietnamese mother and African American father. Taiwanese drag queen Nymphia Wind, who recently won \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race,\u201d told CNN that her ensemble by Singaporean designer Sheng Cheong \u2014 a dress and cape featuring a bold print of neon yellow and white \u201claser cut clouds\u201d \u2014 was intended to \u201creimagine what club kids would look like in the Forbidden City.\u201d Elsewhere, Bollywood filmmaker Karan Johar wore an ornately embroidered suit jacket by Rimple and Harpeet \u2014 an Indian fashion brand that specializes in handcrafted pieces inspired by ancient crafts and vintage textiles \u2014 and Indonesian singer Agnez Mo accessorized with golden hair pins and an elegant hand fan. \u201cAnything goes here and that\u2019s what is so celebratory,\u201d TV personality Jeannie Mai told CNN of the event, which is sometimes described as the \u201cAsian Pacific Met Gala.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the one place where you can really represent and be invited to do so.\u201d The glitzy affair honors the Gold House\u2019s annual A100 list \u2014 one hundred Asian Pacific leaders who have made a significant impact on culture and society. Author and TV host Padma Lakshmi, actor Lucy Liu and the cast and creator of Netflix\u2019s Emmy-award winning series \u201cBeef\u201d were among honorees. For actor and comedian Joel Kim Booster, the significance of a gala feting so many people in the AAPI community, was not lost. \u201cEvents like this are so exciting to me because when I was coming up, I think there was a lot of energy like, there\u2019s only going to be one of us in the room,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so rewarding to be in a space like this where we\u2019re all coming together and supporting each other. It\u2019s not something that I grew up imagining I\u2019d have for myself.\u201d There have been barriers across industries; in Hollywood, Asians have historically been underrepresented or stereotyped. But that has changed in recent years. A\u202fjoint study\u202fby Gold House and the USC Annenberg found the percentage of speaking Asian characters in top box-office films in the US rose from 3.4% in 2007 to 15.9% in 2022. The roles themselves are more complex. The age of streaming has also ushered in more opportunities for diverse and daring storytelling \u2014 on and off screen. FX\u2019s Shogun, for example, became an instant hit when it premiered in February. Not only does it feature a predominantly Asian cast who speak mostly in Japanese \u2014 behind the scenes, Japanese experts in everything from samurai dramas to a \u201cmaster of gesture,\u201d were brought in to ensure authenticity. \u201cI think what the industry has realized is that Asian creativity and Asian talent is a) different and b) lucrative. So that\u2019s been wonderful to see people take chances, and how we\u2019ve knocked it out of the park,\u201d Lakshmi told CNN. Many acknowledge there\u2019s more work to be done all around. \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting time to see the Asian diaspora coming together to really tell our own stories, in our time, in our space,\u201d said fashion designer and the gala\u2019s creative director Prabal Gurung. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see that visibility. There\u2019s a long way to go still, obviously we feel that way.

{"id": "style_greg-girard-kowloon-walled-city-snap", "text": "It was the summer of 1989. Hong Kong\u2019s humidity \u2013 already oppressive \u2013 was intensified\u00a0in the dark, maze-like alleyways of an unruly enclave known as Kowloon Walled City. Then the most densely populated place on Earth, its buildings were packed together so tightly that barely a slither of sky was visible from the ground. Searching for a moment of respite from the heat and chaos below, photographer Greg Girard found himself on the roof of one of the enclave\u2019s many illegally-built high-rises among a tangled thicket of television antennas. He wasn\u2019t alone. In the Walled City, the delineation of private and public spaces \u201cwasn\u2019t always so clear,\u201d Girard recalled in a video call, adding that the roof was an escape for many of its residents to relax, do laundry or watch planes land at Kai Tak International Airport. \u201cOnce you get up to the rooftop, everything sort of changes. The vista opens up, and it\u2019s cooler, there\u2019s a breeze.\u201d Navigating the narrow gaps between buildings with planks of wood, children would skip and play between the webs of laundry lines and satellites.\u00a0\u201cNo one seemed to think of it as a dangerous place, even though there were no guardrails or anything like that,\u201d said Girard. On that particular summer day, some children spotted Girard\u2019s camera and approached him. When he turned the lens on them, they began performing and pulling faces. He snapped several shots, describing the final one, which he eventually chose to publish, as the moment when they had \u201csettled into this face-off with me.\u201d In the photograph a young girl, barefoot and wearing a blue dress, stares into the camera. Her face is relaxed and her hands are wrapped around an antenna pole as if she\u2019s about to swing. In the backdrop, her friend strikes a defiant stance, hands on her hips, while another is in the throes of messing around, bent double in a playful squat. \u201cI thought (the image) captured the kids\u2019\u00a0indifference to the potential danger \u2026 of the rooftop, while at the same time sort of owning their territory and confronting me while goofing around,\u201d said Girard, adding: \u201cIt was just quite an average day up on (there).\u201d The playfulness of the children, juxtaposed with the jagged antennas and stark concrete of their surroundings, seem to epitomized the spirit of Kowloon Walled City, the photographer said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an ideal playground but that never seemed to bother anyone \u2014 which was, of course, very much the spirit of the Walled City: making the best of, and even enjoying life in, a situation most other people would be horrified by.\u201d A \u2018strange, vertical village\u2019 Girard first visited Kowloon Walled City in 1986 while on a shoot at the nearby airport. At that time, around 350 buildings, up to 14 stories high, were packed precariously into a space of 0.01 square miles. Most of the towers were built without proper foundations or regard for safety codes. \u201cThis strange, vertical village wasn\u2019t really supposed to exist,\u201d said Girard, explaining the Kowloon Walled City was the product of a historical and political quirk. Although the enclave was situated in the middle of Hong Kong, then a British colony, imperial officials refused to take legal responsibility for it. As such, the Walled City remained technically subject to Chinese rule, though this was never enforced. \u201cThat allowed it to become something you couldn\u2019t have dreamed up,\u201d Girard added. Existing in ambiguity for nearly a century, it had a reputation for illicit dealings and was infamous for its triads, drug dens, brothels and unlicensed dentistry. But by the time the Canadian photographer made his first visit to the \u201cthriving\u201d city in 1986, triad control had waned and these characterizations were, he said, \u201cvery out of date.\u201d \u201cIt might have been true at one time,\u201d he added. But his enduring memory of the place was the community that lived there. \u201cYou quickly realize that it\u2019s just a place where folks are trying to get by, like any other working-class part of Hong Kong.\u201d Girard was determined to demystify the so-called \u201cCity of Darkness,\u201d particularly after the colonial government announced plans in 1987 to demolish it. He spent four years documenting the Walled City with fellow photographer Ian Lambot, with the pair eventually publishing a book of their images in 1999. Early on, Girard decided to photograph the series in color and used portable lighting equipment \u2014 similar to the kind he used to capture celebrities and CEOs for glossy magazine portraits. \u201cThe only pictures you saw of the Walled City at the time tended to be in black and white, and they made the place look as bad as possible, in keeping with the reputation of the Walled City as a dangerous, squalid slum,\u201d said Girard. When it came to capturing people\u2019s day-to-day lives, and images of residents, shopkeepers and factory owners, the photographer wanted to use \u201ca more even-handed approach,\u201d he added. Girard documented, among much else, the blurred chaos of noodle and fish ball factories, a young child inspecting his grazed knee on the counter of his family\u2019s grocery store, and a barber curling a client\u2019s hair. While initial reactions to his presence were often frosty (\u201cthere was a palpable unwelcomeness to outsiders,\u201d he recalled), residents eventually allowed him into their cramped apartments. His guiding principle, Girard said, was \u201cto try to show it for what it really was, since rumor and myths were the only things that were known about the place.\u201d Imagined dystopias When the Walled City was razed, from 1993 to 1994, that was supposed to be the end of it. But in the decades since, the enclave has arguably garnered more interest than it ever did while standing. In 2014, Girard and Lambot published a \u201crevisited\u201d edition of their book that explored the city\u2019s legacy in popular culture \u2014 including as an inspiration for fictional dystopias in video games and films, such as \u201cCall of Duty: Black Ops\u201d and \u201cBatman Begins.\u201d \u201cThe Walled City was this jumping-off point for an imaginary city where the normal rules don\u2019t apply,\u201d said Girard. There has been renewed interest in architectural circles, too: The unregulated, organic construction that made Kowloon Walled City a \u201cdystopia\u201d to live in is now being examined as a source of innovation due to its resourceful use of limited space and cheap or second-hand materials, said Girard. \u201cThe limitations of that place certainly spurred a lot of creative responses, in building terms, to (the question of) what to do in a place that no one cares about, or pays attention to, except the residents,\u201d Girard added. The site of the Walled City has since been transformed into a public park, which opened in 1995. Quiet and uncrowded, it is in many ways the opposite of what it replaced, providing a much-needed reprieve from the clamor of a city desperately short on public space. Open-air chess pavilions and banyan-shaded ponds surround the old yamen building, a relic of the 19th-century Chinese garrison city that once stood on the site and the only structure to survive the demolition. Inside the building, Girard\u2019s famous rooftop photo is blown-up to fill an entire wall, accompanied by an audio track of children laughing and the roar of airplane engines. The memory of a vibrant community \u2014 immortalized by photographers like Girard \u2014 lingers. Ongoing interest in the Walled City is, Girard suggests, because of the spirit it encapsulates: the aptitude for survival even in the harshest of circumstances. \u201cIt still continues to fascinate,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s wonderful.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/greg-girard-kowloon-walled-city-snap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_07_style_best-dressed-men-met-gala-2024", "text": "At the Met Gala on Monday night, in and amongst the flower-covered gowns (Gigi Hadid, Jordan Roth), naked dresses (Emily Ratajkowski, JLo) and wet T-shirts (Doja Cat), a quiet champion was rising up through the ranks. The humble suit \u2014 often underestimated and overlooked \u2014 was this year reimagined ad infinitum. Nods to the event\u2019s dress code, JG Ballard\u2019s 1962 short story \u201cThe Garden of Time,\u201d came in all forms. For Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton and actor Nicholas Galitzine, who wore Burberry and Fendi respectively, embroidered flowers crept up jacket corners, discreetly sewn in matching thread. There were blooms-turned-bowties, as was the case with actors Jeremy Strong and Jonathan Bailey. Strong\u2019s custom, all-white Loro Piana suit featured a subtle, white flower underpinning his high-collar; while Bailey\u2019s hand-painted purple, white and gold peony (made from metal, \u201cfor someone who has extreme hay fever\u201d he told Vogue) was courtesy of Loewe. And there was a lot of Loewe. \u201cChallengers\u201d co-stars Mike Faist and Josh O\u2019Connor were both spotted in the label \u2014 which was the film\u2019s official outfitter and a part-sponsor of the Met Gala \u2014 wearing the brand\u2019s distinctive quirky charm well. Faist was fastened with a crochet turnip brooch, a wink not only to the event\u2019s horticultural theme but fashion\u2019s appetite for fresh veg in general; while O\u2019Connor paired his elongated tuxedo with a delightful pair of chintz clogs. Comedian Dan Levy\u2019s now-you-see-them, now-you-don\u2019t floral two-piece was another Loewe creation, as was \u201cFifty Shades\u201d actor Jamie Dornan\u2019s fuzzy take on the mourning suit. A throng of male guests also reminded us of the stem-winding, masculine power of flowers. Usher\u2019s dark and brooding ensemble, designed by Se\u00e1n McGirr for Alexander McQueen, included an enveloping cloak and dramatic bleeding rose (which Usher took full advantage of for the camera). Model Wisdom Kaye looked like a phoenix risen from the ashes in his romantic Robert Wun suit and overcoat, with protruding pleats and rose corsage singed to a crisp. Met Gala host, Bad Bunny, was one of the first to arrive onto the carpet in a custom Maison Margiela ensemble complete with shades, leather gloves and a blackened bouquet fashioned from the same fabric as his suit. Coleman Domingo similarly finished off his billowing Willy Chavarria suit with black-rimmed eyes and a drooping bunch of wistful white lilies. But florals were just one avenue of interpretation for Ballard\u2019s story. Set in an aristocrat\u2019s Palladian villa, a handful of attendees chose to hone in on the idea of court dressing. Barry Keoghan\u2019s antiquated, velvet Burberry suit \u2014 complete with a satin necktie and top hat \u2014 featured not one, but three watches: Two on the wrist and one in the pocket, the latter made in the 1930s. Jeff Goldblum and his stylist Andrew Vottero also took cue\u2019s directly from Ballard\u2019s protagonist, Count Axel. \u201c(Vottero) knew the story and devised this thing with Prada,\u201d Goldblum told Vogue host Emma Chamberlain. The actor arrived in what looked like an opulent opera outfit, holding white gloves in one hand, wearing a trailing white scarf, necktie, boxy overcoat and a dazzling constellation of Tiffany brooches. As always, a few stars miss \u2014 or dodge \u2014 the theme entirely, and menswear this year was no exception. Actor Taika Waititi made the case for a head-to-toe full leather suit, while Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne may have just debuted the first ever naked suit in a matching outfit with his wife. But one thing is for certain, after last night, tailoring will never be the same again.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/07/style/best-dressed-men-met-gala-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}

Roberts, an actor who has become a mainstay of rom coms and campy horror \u2014 the latter, most recently with recurring roles in the anthology series \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d \u2014 bought the home, which she shares with her three-year-old son Rhodes, in 2022 and hired the design firm Pierce & Ward to overhaul its interiors. In the May issue of Architectural Digest, she reveals the results of that makeover. For Roberts, having a space that feels like home is a particular priority, she explained, as she moved often as a child. So when she saw the property listed as a rental on Instagram (it has been reported as a former residence of Minnie Driver), she inquired if she could purchase it instead. \u201cI think I lived in 10 houses by the time I was 15 \u2014 so for me now, having a son, I wanted a place that felt really ours.\u201d she told AD. \u201cI have a picture of the day we moved in\u2026 I just remember feeling like we are exactly where we need to be.\u201d The designers, Louisa Pierce and Emily Ward, with whom Roberts had previously worked, are known for down-to-earth spaces that mix bohemian, mid-century modern and rustic styles. Their clients have included Roberts\u2019 \u201cMadame Web\u201d co-star Dakota Johnson as well as Kate Hudson and Leonardo DiCaprio. \u201cWe want a house to look like it\u2019s been there for 50 years,\u201d Pierce told AD in the cover story. \u201cWe never want a home to look new.\u201d In that spirit, much of Roberts\u2019 furniture, art and decor is repurposed or reupholstered. In the living room, beneath a disco ball-like globe light, paperbacks are enclosed in living room cabinets while rarer books are openly displayed. Framed photographs of Debbie Harry and Joni Mitchell rest on wooden cabinets; elsewhere, one of Roberts\u2019 most treasured artworks \u2014 a Julian Wasser portrait of Joan Didion in front of a Corvette \u2014 hangs on the wall. Though many pieces are courtesy of design studios or antique finds, Pierce and Ward don\u2019t look down on more accessible commercial brands. Roberts recalled when she asked if her new kitchen island was custom-made, they laughed and said it was from Urban Outfitters. As for a room for Rhodes, who is starting his own book collection, Roberts opted for a soothing wallpaper scene of flying ducks on the ceiling, above a lush forest-themed upholstered bed. \u201cI remember as a kid, whatever\u2019s on your wall and your ceiling is seared into your brain for the rest of your life,\u201d Roberts explained. \u201cSo I wanted to make it extra cozy and fun, but not too overwhelming.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/16/style/emma-roberts-la-home-architectural-digest/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_style_lotw-john-cleese-miu-miu", "text": "A black crewneck, mid-wash jeans, white blazer and a distressed denim Miu Miu cap. No, this isn\u2019t an off-duty look from Sydney Sweeney or Emma Chamberlain \u2014 it\u2019s the latest outfit worn by British comedian and octogenarian John Cleese. On Friday, Cleese \u2014 who is best known as a founding member of UK comedy troupe Monty Python, as well as the star and co-creator of British sitcom \u201cFawlty Towers\u201d \u2014 stepped out in the unseasonable London sunshine with a $550 appliqu\u00e9 denim logo cap from Miu Miu shielding his eyes. Of course, we have questions. In a mad dash to make a radio show appearance, did Cleese blindly reach for the nearest baseball hat? Was it simply left in the vestibule by his model-turned-comedian daughter, Camilla Cleese? Or is the senior a dedicated Miu Miu man? It wouldn\u2019t be the first time a comedian had a penchant for fashion. In the 1990s, Robin Williams was spotted on the red carpet in pieces from Jean Paul-Gaultier, Issey Miyake and Alexander McQueen. Miuccia Prada\u2019s second label, founded in 1992, has beat it\u2019s bigger sister Prada to the top spot on Lyst\u2019s Hottest Brand Index twice \u2014 a metric that measures the public\u2019s interest in luxury fashion houses. According to the platform, searches for Miu Miu this year have increased 57%, while the brand also reported significant growth in the first quarter of 2024 \u2014 with sales up a record 89%. Miu Miu informed CNN that the comedian is not an official brand ambassador, confirming that the hat is instead a rare instance of organic marketing. But perhaps he should be on the affiliate roster, because Cleese is a surprisingly fitting embodiment of the Miu Miu mantra. Originally billed as the spry, sometimes juvenile sibling to grown-up Prada, Miu Miu has not so much rebranded as redefined its vision of youth. \u201cI say to myself every single morning, \u2018I have to decide if I am a 15-year-old girl or a lady near death,\u2019\u201d Miuccia Prada said after the Fall-Winter 2024 show. The Italian label has succeeded in striking a balance between its Gen Z ambassadors (Emma Chamberlain, Ayo Edebiri, Emma Corrin, to name a few) and those above 50. In September, 63-year-old British actor Kristen Scott Thomas walked the runway for Miu Miu at Paris Fashion Week, along with 70-year-old Dr Qiu Huilan \u2014 who was promoted from loyal customer to catwalk model overnight after being invited to participate by the brand on Instagram. Instead of nailing itself to a literal interpretation, Miu Miu has cultivated an emphasis on youthful energy \u2014 of which Cleese oozes (somewhat literally, too, thanks to the \u00a317,000 cosmetic stem cell therapy treatment he has been receiving annually for the last 20 years). Speaking to host Chris Evans on Virgin Radio on Friday, the comedian recalled a recent meet-up with the other founding fathers of Monty Python, Michael Palin and Terry Gilliam. \u201cI said it was 18 feet of Python,\u201d he told Evans. \u201cAnd it was good to see them again. We\u2019re very silly. We\u2019re disgraceful for old people.

Some passersby even joined emergency services to run inside the burning building and help carry large Renaissance paintings and other objects away from the blaze. Among the paintings saved was Danish artist Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s 1895 work \u201cFrom the Copenhagen Stock Exchange,\u201d the Chamber of Commerce said. Denmark\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, called the fire \u201cour own Notre Dame moment,\u201d referring to the blaze that destroyed the roof and spire of the Paris cathedral, five years ago almost to the day. The fire began at around 8.30 a.m. local time (2.30 a.m. ET), a Copenhagen fire department chief told CNN, and by 11 a.m. nearly half of the building had been destroyed. The fire was still burning by late afternoon. The Chamber of Commerce said it is \u201cat a loss for words for how great a tragedy this is.\u201d It said it was \u201ca sad day for our country\u201d and that \u201cthe damage will unfortunately be very expensive.\u201d \u201cWe have tried to rescue a lot of historic paintings that were inside the building and the historic furniture,\u201d Jakob Vedsted Andersen, an executive director at the Greater Copenhagen fire and rescue service, told CNN. He said it was \u201cway too soon\u201d to speculate about the causes of the blaze. Copenhagen police have told people to avoid the area and there have been no reported injuries so far. People were in the building when the fire started but they were all evacuated, said a police spokesperson who added that military personnel were at the scene to support fire-fighting efforts. A \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d is on fire, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said, calling the building\u2019s cultural heritage \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d The B\u00f8rsen building has been at the heart of Danish business since the 17th century. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt said 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he added in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Emergency services were working to control the fire but it had spread to all floors through the elevator shaft. Frank Trier Mikkelsen, operations manager at the Greater Copenhagen fire department, said the fire is burning \u201cviolently\u201d inside the building, according to TV 2, a government-owned TV channel. Forty firefighters were inside the building, with valuables being rescued, TV 2 reported. Mikkelsen told the Danish broadcaster that the fire is of a type that emergency managers dread, explaining parts of the building\u2019s roof need to be removed to extinguish it. He added machines have been called in to remove some of the copper roof, as the water just bounces off it.

{"id": "2024_03_25_style_ukraine-3d-printed-school-warzone-dfi-hnk-spc-intl-hnk", "text": "With its soft gray lines and sleek, curving exterior, Project Hive looks less like a school and more like a wellness retreat or modern art museum. The structure\u2019s distinctive appearance, with a texture resembling a cocoon or the structure\u2019s namesake beehive, is down to the construction method used to build it: 3D printing. Standing less than 200 feet from School No.23 in Lviv, Ukraine, the walls of the 3,983-square-foot educational facility were printed in just 40 hours with a COBOD gantry printer, which follows digital blueprints to lay concrete like piping icing onto a cake. It\u2019s the first 3D-printed education center in Europe and the first building to be 3D-printed in a war zone, according to Jean-Christophe Bonis, founder of Team4UA, the non-profit responsible for the pilot project. \u201cI\u2019m not a builder; I don\u2019t want to be an architect or a developer\u2026 But through robotics and AI, through technology, we can accelerate the (building) process,\u201d Bonis told CNN in a video interview. Soon after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, places  like Lviv faced a huge problem: how to cope with tens of thousands of people fleeing to \u2014 and through \u2014 the city. In the Lviv region alone, there were 173,000 internally displaced people as of December last year, according to the latest figures from the United Nations\u2019 International Organization for Migration. Project Hive will provide the school with four extra classrooms to help it accommodate additional students displaced by the war, said Bonis. He hopes that, if successful, the project will enable \u201c3D printing to be one of the tools of local construction in Ukraine.\u201d Blackouts and bombings 3D-printed construction can be significantly faster and, some experts believe, more sustainable than traditional building methods. Team4UA collaborated with Ukrainian studio Balbek Bureau on the school\u2019s design, and architecture firm Ars Longa on the engineering. The single-story project broke ground in September 2022, and the entire project, from foundations to finishings, was originally expected to take just three months. But Russian air strikes and bombing across the country through October and November 2022 hit major civilian infrastructure, including the power grid, causing widespread blackouts in Lviv. With local communities turning to power generators, Project Hive was paused while electricity supply became unstable and conditions made it unsafe for the printer to be delivered. It wasn\u2019t until last summer that the situation stabilized in Lviv and the power supply was fully restored, finally allowing the printer to be delivered. Although it took less than two days, cumulatively, to print the building\u2019s concrete frame, Team4UA spread this across six weeks so it could deliver training and development sessions on site. After revising its opening date to January 2024, the project hit another roadblock: funding. Construction costs in Ukraine have risen sharply in the past year, and to complete the final finishing work, such as roofing, windows, doors and interior design, project organizers say they need to raise another $400,000. \u201cI\u2019m facing challenges on a daily basis,\u201d said Bonis. But he continues undeterred: \u201c(This) is also a way of taking technology to give back hope.\u201d A costly option As a relatively new technology, and with limited data on the resulting buildings\u2019 safety and stability, 3D-printed construction has predominately been used for one-off projects or research collaborations. Dutch architecture firm DUS has been experimenting with 3D-printed houses since 2015, and Texas-based construction firm ICON has 3D-printed entire communities in Austin, Texas and Nacajuca, Mexico. In 2020, the Dubai Future Foundation became the world\u2019s first 3D-printed commercial building, and in 2021, the world\u2019s first 3D-printed school was completed in Malawi, with the walls laid in just 18 hours. However, when it comes to large-scale construction, the technology is \u201cstill in its infancy,\u201d said Christian Lange, an associate architecture professor at Hong Kong University, where he oversees the Robotic Fabrication Lab. Lange is skeptical about the benefits of using 3D printing to build in regions with ongoing conflict or disruption. While technology has the potential to be cheaper than conventional building methods, the up-front costs of the printers can be extremely high, and their size can make them difficult and costly to move. According to Lange, there are cheaper, faster alternatives to 3D printing, such as prefabricated and modular buildings. Made using parts that are constructed in factories and quickly assembled on site, prefabs were popular in the early 20th century, when they were used to rebuild after World War II and provide cheap housing for displaced people. \u201cTemporary shelter doesn\u2019t need to be permanent shelter,\u201d said Lange in a phone interview. \u201cWhere 3D printing is really great is when you have special geometries and shapes, because you\u2019re totally free \u2014 the robot or the machine doesn\u2019t care if you build a straight wall or a curved wall.\u201d But in Ukraine, where many technicians, construction workers and industry experts are fighting on the front lines, automation may help counter labor shortages, said Olga Gavura, managing partner at 7CI Group, a contractor on Project Hive. \u201cThe fact this technology helps to build with a smaller number of specialists is a significant advantage,\u201d said Gavura, adding that just four experts were required for the construction phase of Project Hive. As Russian airstrikes continue to devastate the nation\u2019s infrastructure \u2014 2024 has already seen multiple attacks targeting cities, including Lviv, killing civilians and destroying homes \u2014 Gavura believes that, for the number of structures needing to be rebuilt, 3D printing will become essential. She believes pilots like Project Hive can not only test construction processes but will help train a generation of Ukrainian specialists who \u201ccan apply the technology, on their own, in future,\u201d she added. Reconstructing communities Team4UA is not the only organization to see the potential of 3D-printed construction in disaster and conflict zones. Arizona-based construction company Diamond Age is currently in discussion with Ukrainian officials about printing bomb shelters and military infrastructure, said the firm\u2019s CEO Jack Oslan. Diamond Age uses a patented 3D printing system that, it claims, insulates the buildings\u2019 walls. Oslan said his company\u2019s structures are 30% more energy efficient than those made from lumber frames and are strong enough to withstand a Category 5 hurricane or moderate earthquake. \u201cIt\u2019s this climate resiliency that gives us the perfect platform to transition into military and humanitarian applications,\u201d he said, adding that automation could help reduce casualities when building in war zones: \u201cThere (will) be fewer people in harm\u2019s way, which we think is important.\u201d Damage to Ukrainian infrastructure between Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion and September 2023 \u2014 including homes, schools, energy grids and transport networks \u2014 will cost an estimated $151.2 billion to replace, according to a\u00a0study by the Kyiv School of Economics. Researchers found that over 3,500 educational facilities were among the buildings damaged or destroyed, along with over 160,000 homes. Oslan sees huge opportunity for 3D printing to help begin rebuilding the nation. \u201cWe would expect that anything we deliver to Ukraine today to build military or humanitarian structures would ultimately transition into the building of homes, for the reconstruction of (the country\u2019s) communities,\u201d he added. \u2018A vision for this country\u2019 Back in Lviv, there\u2019s more excitement around Project Hive than one might expect for a primary school building, according to Bonis. \u201cWhen I\u2019m on the site, I have children coming to me with their parents and telling me in Ukrainian, \u2018I will be in this school, I\u2019m so excited, my school is unique in the country\u2019,\u201d he said. In an email to CNN, the head of Lviv City Council\u2019s education department, Andriy Zakaliuk, said the project offered \u201ca unique opportunity\u201d to custom-build an environment for young students. \u201cIt is symbolic that they will begin their new stage of life in a new, modern environment,\u201d said Zakaliuk. \u201cNow these children have the opportunity to see that, with the help of a 3D printer, you can build real buildings.\u201d While he awaits  yet another revised opening date for the new school building, Bonis is already planning two more ambitious 3D printing projects \u2014 a bridge in Kherson, and an eight-story building in the center of Kyiv. Team4UA hopes these pilot schemes can help it increase its speed and efficiency while cutting costs for future projects. Bonis is meanwhile establishing a private company that will purchase two 3D printers to offer \u201cprinting as a service\u201d in Ukraine, with profits helping to support Team4UA\u2019s humanitarian aid work. \u201cIt\u2019s not only a concept of printing a school \u2014 it\u2019s a vision for this country,\u201d said Bonis. \u201cThis war will be over sooner or later. At that moment, we need to get back to life, to build back and turn the page.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/25/style/ukraine-3d-printed-school-warzone-dfi-hnk-spc-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}

Granted, the pandemic-induced second hand luxury watch boom peaked back in March 2022, but the market is still going strong, and price levels remain higher than pre-Covid times. \u201cIn the grand scheme of things, prices are increasing \u2014 especially when you look at prices in the primary market,\u201d said Stracke, \u201cand the price level of the primary market is one of the key driving forces of the prices of the secondary market\u2026. We expect in the long term the secondary prices to remain stable \u2014 and go up again.\u201d Experts furthermore predict a return to stability for 2024, and millennials and Gen Z buyers are integral in keeping the momentum going. \u201c(They\u2019re) a crucial demographic for the growth and evolution of the pre-owned and vintage luxury watch industry,\u201d added Paul Altieri, founder & CEO of multi-brand online luxury marketplace Bob\u2019s Watches. The BCG study found that 54% of Gen Z and younger millennials\u00a0surveyed had upped their spending on high-end timepieces from 2021 to 2023, thanks to factors including increased accessibility of buying and selling, investment opportunities and the appeal of community, whether in-person or, of course, on social media platforms like TikTok. There\u2019s also a greater gender balance apparent among these consumers. \u201cMillennial and Gen Z women have been a big part of luxury growth (for pre-owned watches) over the last few years,\u201d added Ertl. \u201cGen Z women in particular are embracing luxury goods in a different way than other generations, and buying goods earlier at a younger age.\u201d Brands which have historically focused on men are adjusting their strategies.\u00a0In June 2023, Ginny Wright, chief executive of the Americas for Audemars Piguet, told Vogue Business: \u201cWe have a much better understanding of what women consider and how they purchase watches differently than their male counterparts. In the US, we are targeting female entrepreneurs and executives from Gen Z to Gen X.\u201d But how \u2014 and where \u2014 to gear up for the glittering, but possibly overwhelming world of luxury second hand watches? Ahead, insiders share their expert knowledge. How can you tell if a luxury pre-owned watch is the real deal? Whether you\u2019re dropping four digits on a Rolex Datejust or six-plus on an Audemars Piguet Royal Oak, you\u2019ll want to know you\u2019re buying genuine goods. \u201cThe first step is to find a trusted retailer, because there\u2019s a lot of options out there,\u201d said Bucherer\u2019s vice president of CPO, David Hong. The term \u201cCPO\u201d \u2014 industry shorthand for certified pre-owned \u2014 means that the brand itself has authenticated the watch as their own, thus also guaranteeing they will officially service it in the future. Bucherer introduced its CPO offerings in 2019, with a two-year guarantee and a trade-in program. The retailer has also officially partnered with Rolex, which launched its own certification program last year. \u201cWe have everything expertly restored,\u201d said Ertl. \u201cEverything goes through multiple steps of services.\u201d (Bucherer sources CPO stock through its in-house \u201cBuy and Trade\u201d program, plus \u201ca network of sources,\u201d Ertl added.) Other luxury brands with in-house pre-owned certification programs include Richard Mille, MB&F and FP Journe; Audemars Piguet has one in the works and Jaeger LeCoultre has unveiled a capsule of rare vintage gems, The Collectibles. (Depending on whom you ask, experts consider watches made 20 to 25 years ago to be \u201cvintage,\u201d and \u201cpre-owned\u201d to be more contemporary models.) Where can \u2014 and should \u2014 you buy a certified pre-owned watch? \u201cCPO is the safest way to do it,\u201d said Wallner of a vintage or pre-owned luxury watch purchase, suggesting the option in particular for first-timers seeking absolute reassurance. \u201cBut it\u2019s probably going to be more costly.\u201d To compare, a pre-owned Rolex Submariner 16610 circa 1991 from US-based Tourneau (acquired by Bucherer in 2018) is priced at $11,500, while Bob\u2019s Watches sells the model for $10,195. The latter Newport Beach-based retailer, which specializes in Rolex but is not an authorized dealer, has its own \u201cmulti-tiered\u201d authentication and restoration process, and collaborates with Swiss watch authentication service WatchCSA in lieu of the official watch brands. The BCG study also points to third party online marketplaces like Chrono24, WatchBox, and Watchfinder, which Richemont bought in 2018, as popular with Gen Z and millennial shoppers. But, \u201cyou\u2019re taking risks no matter what (for non-CPO purchases),\u201d said Wallner, who recently bought a Rolex Datejust from luxury consignment retailer Rebag \u2014 with a safeguard in mind. Clocking the site\u2019s 14-day return policy, she immediately took her purchase to the authorized Rolex dealer Watches of Switzerland. \u201cThey were like, \u2018Yeah, this is in great condition. It\u2019s authentic. Great work,\u2019\u201d she added. Otherwise, she stocks her vintage timepiece collection in large part through  Foundwell, a dealership in high-end vintage watches, jewelry and decor whose selections are carried at Bergdorf Goodman, Harrods and Club Monaco London locations.\u00a0Seasoned collectors often work directly with trusted dealers, found through recommendations and word-of-mouth. What fashion \u2014 and investment \u2014 trends should you consider ? \u201cThe most resounding piece of advice anybody in the watch industry will give is \u2018Buy what you love. Don\u2019t pay attention to the trends,\u2019\u201d said Wallner. It\u2019s important to find a piece that fits with your day-to-day routine: Could a Chopard 44mm Mille Miglia inhibit typing on your Airbook all day? How often would you really wear a dainty \u201860s-era gold diamond and sapphire framed Blancpain? Beyond that, consider how you want to power your watch, for example: A quartz battery-run timepiece or a self-winding or automatic mechanical movement?\u00a0(Rolex makes both.) Depending on your sense of style, you may prefer a larger size case \u2014 the part that holds the movement and dial \u2014 and decide between a stainless steel or leather strap. Bucherer\u2019s plush CPO lounge in New York welcomes people to peruse, converse with an expert and, no pun intended, take their time when it comes to making a purchase. \u201cThe idea is to fall in love with the watch,\u201d said Hong, a process which can take a few dates. Hong often encounters clients expressing sentimental motivations in their search for a pre-owned timepiece. \u201cWe get a lot of stories where people will walk in and talk about their past,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might be a watch as old as my grandfather or great grandfather.\u201d Just don\u2019t ask him about purchasing an \u201cinvestment watch,\u201d though \u2014 Hong holds a more sentimental attachment to timepiece collecting. \u201cLuxury watches of this caliber will go from one generation to the next to the next to the next,\u201d he explained. The BCG study does segment second-hand buyers into four categories, including the \u201cCollector/Investor,\u201d which is described as high income young millennials with a penchant for copping and flipping \u201cultra-luxury watches.\u201d They represent 44% of watch buyers and dominate 58% of the market by value. But Wallner agrees with Hong. \u201cDefinitely don\u2019t buy to flip,\u201d she said. \u201cSpeculation is a losing game.\u201d She may have a point: according to Bloomberg\u2019s Subdial Watch Index, only two Rolex models \u2014 \u201cPepsi\u201d GMT Master II and Lady-Datejust \u2014 increased in price last year. (\u201cRolex, in many cases, is seen as a harder currency that the Euro or the US Dollar in recent years,\u201d noted Chrono24\u2019s Stracke.) Plus, the practice just seems to go against connoisseur etiquette. \u201cPeople really frown upon that,\u201d said Wallner. Buying and quickly selling for a profit is discouraged by collectors and retailers alike for causing unbalanced supply and market volatility. (The practice can also result in banishment from official waitlists, and broader social shame in horology circles.)", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/24/style/luxury-pre-owned-watches/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_07_style_sylvester-stallone-watch-collection-auction-intl-scli", "text": "Shortly after Sylvester Stallone finished filming \u201cRocky,\u201d the movie that launched his Hollywood career, he saw Gregg Allman, from the Allman Brothers Band, who had fallen asleep and had left his arm hanging in the aisle with a distinctive gold watch on his wrist. That watch was the \u201cmost beautiful thing I\u2019d ever seen,\u201d Stallone said in a video released by Sotheby\u2019s, and sparked a decades-long love of watch collecting. And now, the Hollywood star is auctioning 11 watches from his personal collection at a Sotheby\u2019s sale in New York on June 5. Among the items is the rare Patek Philippe Grandmaster Chime, which is expected to fetch as much as $5 million, as well as watches he wore in some of his films. Only seven models of the Grandmaster Chime were ever made, given that it is the most complicated wristwatch ever manufactured by the famous luxury watchmakers. As such, Sotheby\u2019s dubbed it the \u201choly grail\u201d for watch collectors, appreciated for its extraordinarily intricate mechanisms that took 100,000 hours to develop, produce and assemble. It features 20 complications \u2013 functions that go beyond telling the time \u2013 such as five chiming mechanisms and a date repeater which audibly indicate both the date and time. \u201cThis is not easy to come by,\u201d Stallone said. \u201cI had to appeal to certain powers that be, write many letters to the board and eventually it was determined that I was going to be the owner of one of these magnificent pieces of art.\u201d Other memorabilia comes with the watch too, including a presentation box engraved with Stallone\u2019s name and an iPad and Airpods each complete with a Patek Phillipe case. Another Patek Philippe watch, this one from its Nautilus family, is expected to sell for up to $400,000. It features an olive-green dial, surrounded by 32 Wesselton baguette diamonds, in a stainless steel casing. Several other notable watchmakers are represented in the auction too, including models that Stallone wore while on camera. A Rolex watch released in 2016 to mark the 60th anniversary of a model that was the first to display both day and date separately could sell for $50,000. Meanwhile, a watch made by Audemars Piguet featuring a blue face inside a pink gold case is estimated to fetch up to $200,000. Also included in the auction are several Panerai watches, a brand that Stallone has long championed and worn on camera in the 1996 movie \u201cDaylight.\u201d A model exclusively made for him, with an engraving commemorating that on the back, is among the watches featured in this auction and is expected to sell for up to $60,000.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/07/style/sylvester-stallone-watch-collection-auction-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_04_27_style_rr-head-labs-denver-barbers-prison", "text": "\u201dThis is nerve-wracking,\u201d James Canody exclaimed \u2014 through an exhale \u2014 of his new job as an apprentice at the Denver-based business R&R Head Labs. When speaking with CNN, Canody had been working as an apprentice at the barbershop for 13 days. Fourteen days ago he had been released from prison, where he served 6 and a half years of an 18-year sentence. Canody is one of 650,000 people released from prison every year across the United States, according to the Department of Justice. That\u2019s a population of which nearly 75% are still unemployed a year after being released. According to the Brookings Institution, stable employment has been shown to reduce recidivism, but even for those who find a job, earning capacity is likely hindered: Based on a report released by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, formerly incarcerated people who do find employment after their release tend to earn just 53% of the median US worker\u2019s wage. Canody is one of eight employees \u2014 apprentices, barbers and managers \u2014 at R&R Head Labs, a barbershop which opened its doors in February exclusively employing formerly incarcerated and justice-impacted individuals. It aims to address the financial, logistical and emotional inequities associated with their reentry into society. Fresh starts and fresh cuts R&R Head Labs\u2019 model creates a pathway to employment by utilizing skills \u2014 and sometimes a barbering license \u2014 its employees gained while in prison. (Prison programs offering barber/cosmetology licenses are not federally mandated, rather determined state-by-state based on a variety of factors.) Barbering skills aren\u2019t a requirement to work at R&R Head Labs, however, as its paid apprentice program shepherds employees through training, the 2,000 hours of working as an apprentice and 300 hours of classroom or in-shop time required to get a barber license in Colorado. \u201cThis opportunity feels surreal and overwhelming,\u201d said Canody. \u201cBut that\u2019s a good thing. I am getting comfortable with being uncomfortable and see how barbering can help me change my life.\u201d R&R Head Labs is the brainchild of James Repenning,\u00a0a former president of the national barber chain Floyd\u2019s 99. After learning about prison barbering programs, he saw potential in combining his professional experience with a greater purpose. Together with an advisory council \u2014 a group which includes formerly incarcerated people turned advocates \u2014 Repenning has also implemented mentorship programs and community outreach in Denver. \u201cWe started by asking ourselves how we find barbers who have really committed to change and then asking, what do they need?\u201d Repenning explained in a Zoom interview with CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s about understanding how we support them in the work environment, because the pinnacle of what we want to do is give them hope and a path.\u201d Repenning and his team work with Colorado prisons to recruit individuals and get them into the apprenticeship program. According to Repenning, the support from the Colorado Department of Corrections has exceeded expectations, with parole officers facilitating barber tool starter sets and arranging job fairs. \u201cIt\u2019s important (for formerly incarcerated people) to make money \u2014 both because parole requires it and for basic survival,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe solution was to create apprenticeships, so someone can start working immediately and toward the hours they need to earn their barber license.\u201d Transformational opportunities In Denver specifically, R&R Head Labs recruitment and reentry efforts are steered by Charles Smith, a member of the company\u2019s advisory council. Smith served 24 years in prison; after his release, he became the director of advocacy and earned income strategies for CommunityWorks, a non-profit organization which provides job seekers with support service and job readiness instruction. Speaking about the main challenges formerly incarcerated individuals face, Smith lists housing and employment as the most crucial. \u201cEmployment is going to sustain you,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe idle mind is the devil\u2019s workshop. You start doing things, you start drifting. Employment keeps you stable and focused.\u201d \u201cThe model would be to have someone like Charles in every state we go to,\u201d added Repenning. \u201cMany of the people we talk to are people he served with, so there\u2019s a great deal of trust there.\u201d Smith aims to connect with inmates around 90 days before their release date, to start mentoring and prepping them to make their acclimation to life outside of prison easier and more tolerable. Understanding the \u201cpolitics of what happens in prison\u201d is something Smith considers a crucial aspect of his work, and one he believes offers an advantage in approaching and vetting prospective barbers. Several of the seven full-time and part-time barbers currently working at the first location are people Smith knew while serving his own sentence \u2014 including James Canody. \u201cPeople in prison are a forgotten population,\u201d said Smith. \u201cIt is a huge help to people coming out of prison to see and feel that someone finally believes in you. It makes you want to be better.\u201d In\u00a0keeping with its overarching ethos, even R&R\u2019s physical space was designed to best accommodate formerly incarcerated people. With guidance from the\u00a0advisory board, the space was specifically designed to minimize triggers for its employees,\u00a0down to its color palette and barber chair positioning. \u201cEverything by design has to do with connectedness,\u201d explained Repenning. \u201cA lot of barber shops are stainless steel\u2026 ours needs to be super welcoming and warm.\u201d Repenning and his team learned which colors and palettes to stay away from: Certain shades of orange, red, green and blue (which could serve as a reminder of jumpsuit colors) were out; brighter colors, embodying outdoor themes of woodlands and greenery were chosen instead to soften the environment and make it feel uplifting, energetic and approachable. Barber chairs are positioned so that no barber\u2019s back is to the door, another potential vulnerability for an employee who had previously served prison time. \u201cPrison can be a very dangerous place,\u201d said Repenning. \u201c\u2018Watching your back\u2019 takes on extra significance, thus our barbers tend to want to know who\u2019s behind them and who\u2019s walking into the space.\u201d A round bar where people are invited to sit and wait for their appointment was designed specifically to facilitate conversation and community. A barber\u2019s compensation includes floor earnings and commission comparable to other barbershops \u2014 but less commonly, barbers at R&R Head Labs are able to set (and raise) their own prices. Employees also receive health insurance and vacation pay. R&R Head Labs is looking to open an additional shop in Denver later this year, with future expansion into the Boston, Chicago, and New York markets planned.  In its first months of business, the R&R Head Labs location has attracted a diverse crowd, Repenning told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing every race, hair type, gender, income level and age. It\u2019s been a predictably slow start because our barbers typically don\u2019t come with a \u2018book\u2019 (of pre existing clients) as they would if they were transferring from another barbershop.\u00a0However, we are attracting 10+ new customers per day.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like bringing the \u2018hood and Beverly Hills together,\u201d added Smith. \u201cAnd creating this amazing beautiful space. A safe space.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/27/style/rr-head-labs-denver-barbers-prison/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "style_article_liu-heung-shing-coca-cola-snap-mic-intl-hnk", "text": "A young man stands grinning in Beijing\u2019s Forbidden City. It\u2019s the dead of winter, and one of his hands is buried deep into the pockets of his long overcoat to protect it from the chill. The other grasps the unmistakable contours of a glass Coca-Cola bottle. Today, Coke is the world\u2019s most famous soft drink and can be found just about anywhere. But back in 1981, when the image was shot by Pulitzer-Prize winning photographer Liu Heung Shing, it was only just getting into the hands of ordinary Chinese people. Liu, who was in his late 20s when he began working for Time magazine in Beijing, felt the country was on the cusp of a great cultural shift following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976.  \u201cThe changes (at first) were subtle, and unless you lived there, you wouldn\u2019t have noticed,\u201d he recalled during an interview at his home in Hong Kong.  He had earlier photographed people grieving for Mao along the banks of the Pearl River in Guangzhou. It was here that he was struck by how differently people carried themselves compared to what he had seen in late-1950s China, where he grew up during the disastrous Great Leap Forward campaign \u2014 a series of failed industrialization policies \u2014 before moving back to Hong Kong as a child. Under Mao, the country went on to suffer from widespread famine and poverty, and the tumultuous years of the Cultural Revolution. But in the aftermath of the Chinese leader\u2019s death, Liu said, \u201csuddenly, people\u2019s steps looked a little bit lighter, they dropped their shoulders and their faces looked more relaxed.\u201d It would prove to be a relatively liberal period in Chinese history \u2014 politically, economically and in terms of everyday life, which Liu captured in candid shots. One photo from the time showed a plastic surgeon and his client after a cosmetic procedure. Another depicted people gathering at a \u201cDemocracy Wall\u201d in Beijing, where they wrote now-unthinkable criticisms of the government. One of Liu\u2019s most iconic images was captured on his way into the Time bureau after he had the strange feeling that something was \u201cmissing.\u201d He turned his car around and, sure enough, a large portrait of Mao that had once hung prominently on a building had been freshly taken down. He quickly shot images of workers gathered around the depiction of the late Chairman, with some of their scaffolding visible in the frame. This was China \u201cmoving out of the shadow of Mao,\u201d he said. \u2018It tastes so-so\u2019 In December 1978, Coca-Cola became the first foreign enterprise permitted to enter the mainland Chinese market since the communist revolution. That same month, Beijing and Washington announced the normalization of Sino-American relations and Deng Xiaoping kick-started China\u2019s transformative economic reforms with his \u201cOpen Door\u201d policy. (Coca-Cola was first introduced to China in the 1920s but had been forced to leave in 1949, along with other foreign companies, by a government that regarded it as bourgeois). Liu had photographed the opening of a joint-venture bottling plant in Beijing, capturing Coke chairman Roberto Goizueta and Chinese trade officials drinking Coca Cola and holding bottles aloft to cries of \u201cganbei\u201d (cheers). He then thought to himself, \u201cNow where do I find a (regular) Chinese person enjoying this (drink)?\u201d He headed to the Forbidden City, with its heavy flow of tourists, and soon found a man named Zhang Wei purchasing a Coke from a small stand. \u201cI remember he made a comment when he drank this syrupy Coke: \u2018It tastes so-so\u2019\u201d said Liu, who ended up taking a few shots with one of the imperial palace\u2019s picturesque pavilions in the background.  The response to Coke itself may have been underwhelming, but the snap perfectly captured the curiosity and openness many Chinese people felt at the time. \u201cAs a photographer, I of course realized the significance. That this man, dressed in a ubiquitous PLA (People\u2019s Liberation Army) coat, was one of the very first people to taste it,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cBut I didn\u2019t realize it would become part of the Chinese collective memory.\u201d The image would be widely published and displayed in the following years, and he later became friends with Zhang. In 1983, it appeared in Liu\u2019s photography book \u201cChina after Mao,\u201d a collection of images taken between 1976 and 1982. More recently he included it in his book \u201cLiu Heung Shing: A Life in a Sea of Red.\u201d   The photographer would go on to document other periods and profound events in the country\u2019s modern history, including the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. And just like those pictures of young student activists calling for democracy, Liu\u2019s Coca-Cola photograph feels part of another era altogether. With its apparent embrace of the new and the foreign \u2014 ideas encapsulated in that most American of drinks \u2014 the image stands in stark contrast to today\u2019s China, where relations with the US are at an all-time low. Xi Jinping\u2019s nationalist agenda has generated increasingly xenophobic attitudes towards the West.   \u201cI realized that the story I did in the last quarter of the 20th century (would) continue to carry relevance into the 21st century,\u201d Liu said. \u201cEspecially with the story of China, I never doubt that these photographs are in the Chinese people\u2019s collective memory. \u201cEven though this memory keeps being re-edited\u2026 the good thing about a photograph, is you cannot re-edit it. It becomes an image seared in people\u2019s minds.\u201d Top image: A 1981 photograph of a man with a Coke bottle in Beijing\u2019s Forbidden City, shot by Liu Heung Shing.

{"id": "2024_05_09_style_elle-fanning-met-gala-balmain-lotw", "text": "To some, arriving at an important event naked is the stuff of nightmares. For others, it\u2019s a meticulously planned reality. For Elle Fanning, who showed up to Monday night\u2019s Met Gala in a completely transparent Balmain gown, it was the latter. Radiant, gleaming and gossamer, the actor looked like she was one false step away from shattering. According to Balmain, the frock\u2019s organza fabric was hand-covered with four layers of resin to achieve a glass effect. The resulting garment conjured images of the precious \u201ccrystalline flowers\u201d used to reverse the clock in JG Ballard\u2019s 1962 short story, \u201cThe Garden of Time\u201d (this year\u2019s Met Gala theme). But Fanning wasn\u2019t the only celebrity embracing a full-frontal look. Emily Ratajkowski, Kim Kardashian, Doja Cat, Phoebe Dyvenor, Greta Lee and even Eddie Redmayne all wore sheer outfits onto the red carpet, often with nothing but strategically placed embroidery or crystal embellishing to protect their modesty. Behold: The naked dress (or in Redmayne\u2019s case, naked suit). Designs that hint, some more subtly than others, at the wearer\u2019s nudity have become a mainstay on celebrity red carpets and runways. Doja Cat and Miley Cyrus both donned barely-there nude gowns at the Grammy Awards in February; while at the Oscars in March Jennifer Lawrence, Vanessa Hudgens, Florence Pugh, Kendall Jenner, Ice Spice, Charli XCX, Charlize Theron and Iris Law reminded us of the many varieties of a naked dress \u2014 from transparent lace to crystal netting. On the Spring-Summer 2024 catwalks, too, see-through skirts were spotted at almost every show, from Prada to Erdem, Acne Studios to Dior. But this preoccupation with sartorial teasing is not new. In 1962, Hollywood actor Carroll Baker was photographed in one of the first ever naked dresses \u2014 also designed by Balmain. Baker\u2019s breasts were covered (for the most part) with two embellished pasties sewn onto a sheer torso panel, while embroidered beads and sequins trimmed the sleeves, the neckline and covered the entire skirt. It was a custom look, created specifically for Baker by Pierre Balmain at his atelier in Paris. \u201c(Baker) particularly likes muslin dresses with sparkles placed at the critical points,\u201d wrote ELLE magazine in 1964. \u201cShe already has seven. Balmain just designed the 8th one.\u201d Today\u2019s abundance of nude gowns can sometimes make the red carpet look more like a Spencer Tunick photograph. But in the early days of these peek-a-boo garments, wearers still managed to ruffle a few feathers. Particularly in Baker\u2019s case, when she arrived one October evening at the Plaza cinema in London for the premiere of her latest film \u201cThe Carpetbaggers\u201d (1964). Her sheer Balmain dress turned heads \u2014 and generated headlines. \u201cCarroll goes to the show \u2014 almost topless,\u201d wrote British tabloid the Daily Mirror. \u201cIt\u2019s about as near as you can get to a topless dress without actually being topless.\u201d Balmain\u2019s \u201ctransparent\u201d dresses, as he called them, were some of the first high-fashion naked dresses to garner widespread attention (Yves Saint Laurent didn\u2019t create his first full-sheer look until 1966). In the 1960s, women\u2019s fashion in America and Europe was changing at a rapid pace thanks, in part, to the sexual liberation movement and the gradual introduction of the contraceptive pill. Mary Quant devised the scandalous mini skirt, while Edie Sedgwick rejected bottoms altogether \u2014 favoring instead an underwear and tights combo that is still referenced today. Although, Baker\u2019s barely-there dress may have been more than just a sign of the times. In 1964 \u2014 just a few months before her \u201ctopless\u201d moment at London\u2019s Plaza cinema \u2014 the New York Times called Baker \u201cthe most controversial female star in Hollywood,\u201d namely for her perceived comfort with on-screen nudity. Nudity was strictly censored in US films by the Production Code Administration, an independent body which relied on distributors to help enforce standards. After the Paramount Decrees in 1948 \u2014 a landmark ruling that forced companies such as Paramount, Fox, MGM and Warner Brothers to divest from theaters \u2014 cinemas were suddenly liberated from the thumb of powerful studios. By the 1960s, a nudity violation raised by the Production Code Administration meant a lot less than it did 20 years ago, as cinemas had the final decision on whether to run the film or not. Baker, according to the New York Times, had become \u201ca major target of heated arguments about nudity in American films.\u201d The actor responded nonchalantly and almost prophetically, \u201cI believe that in the next 10 years nudity will be accepted in movies\u2026 I do not think movie nudity will injure the national character.\u201d So while the press and wider world fizzed at Baker\u2019s on-screen state of undress, she decided to do one better, and give them a glimpse of the real thing. While Fanning\u2019s look was markedly less controversial than Baker\u2019s, it proved that even after six decades, the naked dress is still as relevant as ever.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/style/elle-fanning-met-gala-balmain-lotw/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "style_article_sunil-gupta-india-gate-snap", "text": "To passersby, the sight of two men embracing besides New Delhi\u2019s India Gate in 1986 might have seemed unremarkable. In a city where public displays of platonic male affection are relatively commonplace, it was photographer Sunil Gupta who attracted more attention at the time. \u201cMen holding hands or lying in each other\u2019s laps is not an issue \u2014 it looks very romantic from (the outside), but they\u2019re usually just hanging out,\u201d he said in a video interview from the UK, before recalling: \u201cI was creating more interest than them, because I was standing there with a tripod and a camera, so everybody was focused on me.\u201d Onlookers may not have realized, but Gupta was creating a subtly subversive image in what he has described as the \u201crepressive atmosphere\u201d of 1980s India. At a time when homosexuality was more taboo in the country than it is today \u2014 and with consensual gay sex then criminalized as an \u201cunnatural offense\u201d \u2014 the photographer had found his subjects via the informal networks constituting Delhi\u2019s gay scene. The pair in question had chosen the war monument\u2019s gardens for their photo shoot due to its reputation as a cruising spot.  Having lived in New Delhi until his mid-teens, London-based Gupta knew this from personal experience. \u201cI passed that place on my way to school every day for 11 years,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just had to hop off the bus and get laid on your way home. It was very easy.\u201d The image forms part of the photographer\u2019s series \u201cExiles,\u201d which was first exhibited in the UK in 1987 but is this week showing at the India Art Fair in New Delhi. Primarily shot outdoors around India\u2019s capital, it captures gay men sat on benches or in public places popular among those looking for casual sexual partners, their faces often out of shot or turned away from the camera. Concerned about \u201couting\u201d his subjects, Gupta treated them as collaborators in what he called a \u201cconstructed documentary\u201d approach. After shooting his images and developing the film in London, he returned to Delhi with printed contact sheets to ensure the men were comfortable with the pictures he selected for his show. \u201cThere was quite a bit of horsing around in the pictures,\u201d he said of the India Gate shoot. \u201cAnd there were other photos that were (more suggestive)\u2026 So I picked a somewhat tamer one to put in the series.\u201d The other ethical challenge, he recalled, was communicating to the duo how the images would be used \u2014 and the art of photography itself. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t for publication, and the only way they saw pictures was in a magazine, so it took some explaining,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThen I tried to explain the process.\u201d Photography for many at the time, Gupta observed, was still \u201ca very mysterious thing that only a few people did in a darkroom.\u201d   For \u2018the canon\u2019  Now among India\u2019s most celebrated photographic artists, Gupta often addressed LGBTQ experiences in his explorations of race, immigration and identity. While studying in the US in the mid-1970s he produced a now-celebrated series of photos from New York\u2019s Christopher Street that captured the city\u2019s gay scene in the years between the Stonewall Riots and onset of the AIDS epidemic. Although \u201cExiles\u201d presented a rare portrait of gay life outside the West, Gupta\u2019s intended audience was always back in London. Homophobia was rife in 1980s Britain, and the photographer said he faced \u201ca lot of hostility\u201d at art school for making work relating to his sexuality. \u201cI couldn\u2019t make gay work, and I couldn\u2019t make gay work about India, especially,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was none in the library for reference. So, I thought, \u2018I\u2019m making it my mission to make some. Not for India, but for this canon \u2014 we need to have gay Indian guys in our library, in our art schools, over here.\u2019\u201d New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art has since acquired several of the pictures for its permanent collection, signifying the series\u2019 place in contemporary photography. But it was not an instant success. \u201cIt didn\u2019t have any impact when it was first shown,\u201d Gupta said of its debut.  \u201cI think it was too early.\u201d By the 1990s, however, interest in Gupta\u2019s work was growing, as art made by, and about, gay people of color became increasingly visible in the West. The fact that \u201cExiles\u201d is now showing in India, where he said it is positively received, is testament to changes on the subcontinent, too.  Although the country\u2019s LGBTQ communities still face significant social stigma, gay sex was decriminalized in 2018 and the arrival of apps like Grindr have been transformative, Gupta said. (\u201cThose sorts of chance meetings behind the bush are not happening \u2014 or maybe happening less,\u201d he added). This modern context and the power of hindsight have helped paint the photos in a new light. \u201cI think it has become historical enough that people are curious about what gay life was like before Grindr and the internet,\u201d Gupta said. \u201cPeople think it was all doom and gloom, and people jumping off buildings. They don\u2019t seem to appreciate that we also managed to have some kind of a life back then.\u201d This is a message reflected in the photographer\u2019s carefree India Gate shoot, which he recounts as a relaxed day of fun and abundant sunlight. \u201cIt just seemed very pleasurable. It was a nice day out, and I got to hang out with these guys who were having a good time and having a laugh.\u201d \u201cExiles\u201d is showing via Vadehra Art Gallery at India Art Fair, which runs February 9-12 in New Delhi, India.

{"id": "2023_07_03_style_felipe-romero-beltran-dialect-spain-migration", "text": "Photographer Felipe Romero Beltr\u00e1n\u2019s depiction of a migrant facility in Spain oozes with the boredom and malaise of life in legal limbo. His young subjects are seen smoking cigarettes, lifting weights and trimming one another\u2019s hair. Other images show them hanging out in a grubby yard or lying around on mattresses. The photos were shot with the help of nine young Moroccans whom Beltr\u00e1n befriended in Seville, capital of the southern region of Andaluc\u00eda. Published in his new book \u201cDialect,\u201d the pictures were initially intended to be personal, not political. But they ultimately spoke to what Beltr\u00e1n called a \u201cKafka-esque\u201d system in which the men waited for years to learn whether their residency applications would be approved. \u201cAt the beginning, it was just about this group of guys,\u201d Beltr\u00e1n said on a video call from Madrid. \u201cBut of course, I realized that I was photographing these really specific political bodies, or political subjects in this bureaucracy.\u201d Last year, nearly 30,000 migrants arrived in Spain by sea, down from a record of over 58,000 in 2018, according to UNHCR data. Of these, most arrived in the Canary Islands or Andaluc\u00eda, a region separated from Morocco by the Strait of Gibraltar, a stretch of water just 13 kilometers (eight miles) at its narrowest. The nine men, who didn\u2019t previously know one another, were among those to arrive by boat during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic in search of a better life. Recounting his journey with an essay in \u201cDialect,\u201d one of Beltr\u00e1n\u2019s subjects, Youssef Elhafidi, recalls another terrified teen migrant being forced by smugglers to pilot their boat. \u201cHe did not want to drive, the fear was paralyzing him, they took out a knife and put it on his neck, threatening him to start the engines,\u201d Elhafidi wrote. \u201cThe boy started the machine between trembling and crying and we headed north.\u201d Killing time According to Beltr\u00e1n, his nine subjects were required to stay in Spain for three continuous years before applying for residency. Undocumented and without the right to work during this time, they were dependent on the state for food and housing. While living at the government-run facility, the men took Spanish lessons and joined workshops to help them adapt to life in Spain \u2014 some of which were run by Beltr\u00e1n. Overcoming an initial language barrier, the photographer began working with the group to produce images and videos. As well as candid portraits, the pictures focus on conditions at the facility, from peeling walls to basic food supplies. Many of the images were, however, staged. As Beltr\u00e1n looked for different ways to engage with his subjects, he asked them to re-enact moments from their respective migration journeys. In one, a subject lies motionless on blue gym mats, just as he had upon landing on Spain\u2019s coast. Another shows two of the men carrying a third on their shoulders to recreate the moment he fainted during a day-long walk to Seville from a small town to its south. The resulting book is thus part documentary and part performance, with Beltr\u00e1n toeing the line between mentor and collaborator, photographer and choreographer. More than just an artistic decision, staging photos directly responded to the tedium of the migrants\u2019 abundant free time. \u201cThere was an activity around taking the images \u2014 it was something during the day that (could get them) excited. And it was fun,\u201d Beltr\u00e1n recalled. \u201cEveryone was laughing, and they just make jokes each other during the sessions.\u201d Lost in translation When Beltr\u00e1n began delivering workshops at the facility in 2020, he was all too familiar with the system his subjects were trapped in. A few years earlier, he had relocated to Spain from his native Colombia, and \u2014 even as a college-educated Spanish speaker \u2014 also struggled to navigate the complex immigration processes. To illustrate the challenge facing his francophone subjects, his project included a video titled \u201cRecital\u201d in which they attempted to read the first four pages of the Spanish immigration law that would determine their futures. \u201cThey weren\u2019t understanding a word,\u201d he recalled, noting that, although lawyers were assigned to act on the men\u2019s behalf, the language barrier and dense legalese removed their agency. The opening pages of \u201cDialect\u201d \u2014 whose title alludes to these very linguistical challenges \u2014 are dedicated to stills from the video. Pictures of the men struggling to comprehend the legislation are overlaid with technical terminology (\u201cRight to effective judicial protection\u201d reads the text on one frame; another says, \u201cAuthorizations for the purpose of carrying out profit-making activities\u201d). \u201cThese legal procedures are really, really complicated, even for native speakers,\u201d said Beltr\u00e1n, who is now completing a PhD program in photography in Madrid. \u201cIt becomes almost like translation work \u2014 translating these laws and bureaucracies into (something understandable to) normal people like us.\u201d The result, he said, is an inevitable sense of helplessness. \u201cYou can\u2019t talk with anyone,\u201d Beltr\u00e1n added. \u201cYou can\u2019t ask, \u2018Who is the law?\u2019 or \u2018Who is the state?\u2019 You don\u2019t have anyone to approach. You don\u2019t have any tools to make a living\u2026 The system is built to avoid you, or to deny you access to (it).\u201d Describing the group as \u201cjust young people trying to figure out what to do with life,\u201d the photographer hopes his project can humanize migrants\u2019 experiences in a world increasingly desensitized to images of their suffering. Since Beltr\u00e1n completed his project, most of his subjects have completed their three-year wait and now formally reside in Spain, he says. He remains in touch with some \u2014 including Elhafidi, who he says works in a restaurant and has accompanied him at promotional events for the book\u2019s launch. In the conclusion of his essay, Elhafidi recalled how he felt when he secured his residency, writing: \u201cIt took me three years of searching and putting courage to life, until finally the moment came, after being cold, scared, hungry and the most difficult thing, my mother\u2019s tears\u2026 I got it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI got the papers. Now after getting it I have another look at life, I finally feel that I have the opportunity to be whoever I want to be.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re building their lives,\u201d Beltr\u00e1n said of those, including Elhafidi, who have secured residency. \u201cFortunately, they now can go back to Morocco to visit and see their families.\u201d \u201cDialect,\u201d published by Loose Joints, is available now.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/07/03/style/felipe-romero-beltran-dialect-spain-migration/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_style_kate-medley-photography-gas-stations-american-south", "text": "Two decades ago, when the photojournalist Kate Medley was in graduate school in Oxford, Mississippi, she would often frequent a local gas station with an off-menu offering: Tupperware containers full of home-cooked Indian food, made by the owners, for whomever knew to ask. Though it would be years before she began a long-term series on the gas stations and roadside stops of the American South, Medley\u2019s pit stops intrigued her; she grew to recognize the spaces as vital foodways in both urban and rural areas. Though many provide simple goods and services \u2014 like coffee, hot dogs or an oversized bathroom key \u2014 others offer diverse, unexpected offerings: crawfish etouff\u00e9e, tamales, Cajun-style b\u00e1nh m\u00ec, all-you-can-eat barbecue, or even an entire country ham to purchase along with your cigarettes. Often overlooked because of their perceived liminal nature, these quick stops can be lifelines for the communities they serve, Medley pointed out, as well as opportunities for people to strive for the so-called American Dream. (In 2013, the Fiscal Policy Institute reported that 61% of all fueling stations in the US are independently owned by immigrants.) \u201cIncreasingly, as I traveled, I felt like there was this big gap in scholarship that did not take seriously the role that these spaces play,\u201d Medley explained in a phone call. \u201cAnd I found it super compelling \u2014 the people who work there, the food that they\u2019re cooking and the community they\u2019re creating. I see as integral to who we are as Southerners and what this region has to offer.\u201d Now, \u201cThank You Please Come Again\u201d is both a photo book of 200 images, published late last year, and the subject of Medley\u2019s first museum exhibition at the Mississippi Museum of Art in Jackson, where she grew up. Scouting across the South For a decade, Medley took the images while on the road, at first on the side when she was on assignment, then as her main focus as the project progressed. She visited around 150 gas stations and quick stops in total, finding the unique curation of each space compelling. \u201cThere\u2019s this sort of mystery of these spaces,\u201d she said. \u201cAs you approach them, you open that little glass door and hear the bell jingle. What will be inside? What will it smell like? Who will be there? What\u2019s on the menu that day?\u201d These hidden gems include Saint Louis Saveurs in Greensboro, North Carolina, an outpost for Senegalese food in the back of a Circle K that serves up jollof rice and the grilled lamb dish dibi. The modest restaurant used to be a Dunkin Donuts, Medley noted \u2014 the door handle was still a \u201cD\u201d when she photographed the space. Then there\u2019s the Hammond, Louisana-based Icebox \u2014 a Punjabi dhaba, or gas station-adjacent foodery, that stripped out its convenience-store goods in favor of a full Indian buffet. The owners positioned Icebox at the intersection of two interstates in order to serve long-haul truckers, Medley learned after speaking with them \u2014 particularly those recruited from India, she explained. \u201cThey have found tremendous success,\u201d she said. \u201cBut actually, when I was there, they were telling me that their new business plan is to rip out the dhaba and return that to a convenience store. They\u2019re going to move the dhaba to a standalone restaurant building, because they decided that rich people will never eat in a gas station.\u201d Changing landscapes For every success story, there are businesses struggling \u2014 a lot of them, Medley noted, particularly in rural areas where the population has declined. In one station in Elaine, Arkansas, she said, the gas pumps have been discontinued and the grocery shelves are bare; a local farmer bought the space purely to offer hot food options to local farmworkers hot food each day, who bring in consistent revenue. \u201cThe closest gas is 30 miles away,\u201d Amanda Simonson, the general manager, told Medley when she walked in, according to Medley\u2019s book. \u201cBut I can offer you smothered pork chops.\u201d In Banner, Mississippi, the owner of Pop\u2019s gas station explained to Medley just how important his business was to nearby residents, pointing out a local customer who was there for the lunch plate. \u201cSince his wife died last year, he eats at Pop\u2019s for breakfast, lunch, and dinner,\u201d the owner, Jeff Poynor, told her. One of the advantages of these small businesses is their adaptability, Medley argued. Though not all have been able to stay in business over the years, she\u2019s found that many others have transformed. Gone are the Slim Jims and Red Bulls \u2014 instead you might find a little nightclub, or a ham-curing enterprise that ships out around the country. (She\u2019s seen both.) \u201cI feel optimistic that they\u2019re continuing to pop up,\u201d she said of the stores. \u201cI don\u2019t think these places are going away\u2026 What that\u2019ll look like, in 50 years with electric vehicles or self-driving cars or whatever\u2019s next \u2014 I\u2019m not sure.\u201d \u201cBut I feel confident it will be something,\u201d she added, \u201cthat these buildings will persist, and that entrepreneurs will persist in finding a way to make them work.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/style/kate-medley-photography-gas-stations-american-south/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_04_09_style_otzi-iceman-tattoos-study-scn", "text": "Found high in the Tyrolean Alps in 1991, \u00d6tzi the Iceman had dark skin and eyes and was likely bald. His remarkably well-preserved remains, frozen beneath ice for about 5,300 years, revealed 61 tattoos inked all over his body. How and why \u00d6tzi, perhaps the world\u2019s most studied corpse, got the body art has long been a source of fascination. Initial analysis suggested the tattoos were incised with a blade and then impregnated with black pigment. Now, the latest research strongly suggests a single-point puncture tool, tipped with carbon pigment, could have been behind the markings. \u201cOne of the threads we identified is that a lot of the work that was done on his tattoos initially was done by scholars who were excellent scholars but they were not themselves tattooed and didn\u2019t have personal experience with the tattooing process,\u201d said Aaron Deter-Wolf, lead author of the new study. \u201cOver the years, I\u2019ve had numerous conversations with professional tattooists and when you get talking about it and looking at the pictures, they say, oh, no, oh, no, those absolutely are not cut into the skin \u2026 but that hadn\u2019t been shown in a scientifically sound setting,\u201d explained Deter-Wolf, a prehistoric archaeologist at the Tennessee Division of Archaeology who has a tattoo similar to one of \u00d6tzi\u2019s on his wrist. The study, published in the European Journal of Archaeology on March 13, reviewed existing literature on \u00d6tzi\u2019s tattoos and drew on present-day experiments replicating ancient tattooing techniques. \u201cMost of them were on the lower legs and ankles. One on the left wrist and there\u2019s a set of them on the lower back around the cervical spine,\u201d Deter-Wolf said. \u201cThey\u2019re lines that are in some cases crossed but more often parallel to one another. They range from two (lines) to five or six of them.\u201d Scientists have analyzed nearly every part of \u00d6tzi and his belongings, painting an intimate picture of life in the late fourth millennium BC. And now, the new study provides a better understanding of how the oldest known tattoos in human history were created, though questions still remain about the meaning behind the body art. A scientific celebrity Originally, researchers believed \u00d6tzi froze to death, but a 2001 X-ray revealed an arrowhead in his shoulder, which would have been fatal. The iceman also had a head injury, possibly sustained at the same time, and his right hand shows a defensive wound. The mystery over \u00d6tzi\u2019s violent death, who he was and how he ended up on a mountain pass has sparked interest far beyond the field of archaeology. Each year, thousands visit his mummified remains, which are on display at the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Bolzano, Italy. The existing body of science on \u00d6tzi is astonishingly comprehensive. Stomach contents yielded information on his last meal and where he came from, study of his DNA has revealed his ancestry and appearance, his weapons showed he was right-handed, and his clothes gave a rare look at what ancient people actually wore. In a February 2016 study, Deter-Wolf compiled a database of dozens of examples of ancient tattoos, including body art found on Egyptian, Chinese and Incan mummified remains, that pinpointed \u00d6tzi\u2019s body art as the oldest known examples of tattooing. The feat was possible thanks to nondestructive digital imaging technology and collaborations between archaeologists and tattoo artists. \u201cOnce we all put our heads together, we come up with a lot better and more informed hypothesis about how these things work,\u201d he said. The 2016 study suggests that tattoos are a long-standing and widespread cultural practice, with different means of permanently inserting pigments beneath the skin. The techniques include hand poking or tapping with the use of a single-point tool that may or may not have a handle; incision; and subdermal tattooing, or skin stitching, using a needle to thread an ink-soaked filament or sinew. Deter-Wolf and his colleagues also experimented with different traditional techniques in a September 2022 study. Using eight tools fashioned from animal bone, obsidian, copper and boar tusk, along with a modern steel needle, New Zealand-based traditional tattoo artist and study coauthor Danny Riday inked tattoos on his leg. The tattoos on \u00d6tzi \u2019s body have rounded edges consistent with a hand-poked tattoo, most likely made with a bone or copper, Deter-Wolf said. In contrast, incision tattooing creates edges that are pointed because of the way the lines are cut into the skin. \u201cThere\u2019s a variation within the line because you\u2019re putting in all of these individual punctures so closely to each other and how much they overlap results in kind of a stippling effect when you look at it under high enough magnification.\u201d A bone awl \u00d6tzi carried in his tool kit was a potential candidate but has yet to be studied in detail to confirm whether microscopic wear marks are consistent with a tattooing function. However, Deter-Wolf thinks it\u2019s unlikely. \u201cIt\u2019s strongly evocative in (the) context (of a) woodsman\u2019s kit rather than a tattooing kit.\u201d The new knowledge about how \u00d6tzi\u2019s tattoos were likely made was \u201cparticularly exciting\u201d because the puncture method used showed a continuity with present-day tattoo techniques, said Dr. Matt Lodder, a senior lecturer of art history and theory, and director of American studies at the University of Essex in the UK. \u201cThe real magic of \u00d6tzi\u2019s story to modern eyes is how familiar it feels \u2014 anyone who has been tattooed, particularly if you\u2019ve been tattooed with hand tools, can relate to the sensations he would have felt whilst being tattooed, the process he went through to heal his tattoos,\u201d said Lodder, who is also the author of \u201cPainted People: Humanity in 21 Tattoos.\u201d He was not involved in the study. \u201cThat we can empathise so strongly with a man who lived five millennia ago is a remarkably powerful link to our shared human past.\u201d Unresolved mystery of \u00d6tzi\u2019s tattoos Why did \u00d6tzi have so many tattoos? One explanation put forth in the scientific literature is that they were an ancient healing technique, a bit similar to an early form of acupuncture, rather than body art. Many of the tattoos could have been an ancient way to treat joint pain in his lower back, knees, hip and wrists. \u201cWe don\u2019t disagree with the idea that they could have been therapeutic. I think all of it\u2019s on the table. Just because something has given us a therapeutic treatment doesn\u2019t mean that it doesn\u2019t have culturally symbolic value,\u201d Deter-Wolf said.

{"id": "2024_03_18_style_japan-shigeichi-negishi-karaoke-inventor-death-intl-hnk", "text": "Shigeichi Negishi, the entrepreneur who invented the world\u2019s first karaoke machine, has died aged 100. Negishi, whose 1967 \u201cSparko Box\u201d prototype is among several devices credited with ushering in Japan\u2019s karaoke craze, died from natural causes in January. His death, which was made public last week, was confirmed to CNN by Shiro Kataoka, managing director of the All-Japan Karaoke Industrialist Association. Born in 1923, Negishi founded and ran a company\u00a0that assembled car stereos for automobile manufacturers in northern Tokyo. A regular listener to a singalong radio show\u00a0broadcast in Japan at the time, he hooked a\u00a0spare tape deck up to a microphone and mixing circuit so he could hear himself singing over music. \u201cWhen I asked the factory engineer, he said, \u2018It\u2019s easy,\u2019\u201d Negishi recalled in an account published by the All-Japan Karaoke Industrialist Association, an industry body for Japan\u2019s karaoke operators.\u00a0\u201cSo, I attached a microphone input terminal to the car stereo and created something like the prototype of a jukebox.\u201d According to author Matt Alt, whose interview with Negishi features in his 2020 book \u201cPure Invention: How Japan Made the Modern World,\u201d the inventor first tested the device with an instrumental tape of Yoshio Kodama\u2019s 1930s song \u201cMujo no Yume.\u201d \u201cIt works!\u201d he told Alt, recalling the moment he heard his voice\u00a0coming through the speakers alongside the music. \u201cThat\u2019s all I was thinking. Most of all, it was fun. I knew right away I\u2019d discovered something new.\u201d Marketing the device as a Sparko Box, he sold them alongside lyrics cards and reportedly produced and installed around 8,000 around Japan, mainly at bars and restaurants. By the time Negishi stopped selling the products in the 1970s, several rival machines had been invented and taken to market. \u201cAt that time, it was not customary to sing in stores, so it may have been inevitable that (the Sparko Boxes were) sold as background music,\u201d reads Negishi\u2019s entry on the\u00a0All-Japan Karaoke Industrialist Association\u2019s website.\u00a0\u201cNow that I think about it, it\u2019s a bit of a shame.\u201d The industry body does not credit a single person with inventing karaoke (which literally translates as \u201cempty orchestra\u201d), but instead recognizes several people who independently created machines in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Perhaps the best known of them is musician and businessman Daisuke Inoue, whose\u00a08 Juke machine \u2014 invented in 1971, and also based on a car stereo \u2014 is credited with helping commercialize karaoke. But Inoue, like Negishi, did not patent his invention, and electronics manufacturers soon began producing and marketing their own versions. By the 1980s, \u201ckaraoke boxes\u201d (known elsewhere as KTVs) had swept Japan, with private rooms overtaking bars and restaurants as the main venues for Japan\u2019s amateur singers. Subsequent developments, including the introduction of video karaoke and networked karaoke systems, helped the phenomenon spread across Asia and the world in the following decades. Today, Japan is home to more than 8,000 dedicated karaoke box venues, while 131,500 bars are equipped with karaoke machines \u2014 a market worth\u00a0a combined 387.9 billion yen ($2.6 billion) in 2022,\u00a0according to estimates from the All-Japan Karaoke Industrialist Association.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/18/style/japan-shigeichi-negishi-karaoke-inventor-death-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_04_29_style_dodecahedron-roman-object-mystery-scn-scli-intl", "text": "Amateur archaeologists in England have unearthed one of the largest Roman dodecahedrons ever found, but mystery surrounds what it was actually used for. The 12-sided object is one of just 33 known to exist in Roman Britain, and one of approximately 130 in the world. It is considered \u201cone of archaeology\u2019s great enigmas,\u201d according to the Norton Disney History and Archaeology Group, an amateur group based in the English region of Lincolnshire where it was found in June. Measuring about 8 centimeters (3 inches) across, the dodecahedron is hollow and covered with 12 holes of varying sizes. The 1,700-year-old object will be displayed at the Lincoln Museum from May 4 until early September. \u201cIt\u2019s a real pleasure to have the Norton Disney dodecahedron joining us\u2026 just a stone\u2019s throw from where it was found,\u201d Andrea Martin, exhibitions and interpretations manager at the museum, said in a Lincolnshire County Council press release. \u201cTo have the opening of the display coincide with the Lincoln Festival of History is a real coup.\u201d The release describes the dodecahedron as \u201cone of the largest examples\u201d discovered. However, experts still aren\u2019t sure exactly what the Romans used the dodecahedron for. \u201cIt is completely unique,\u201d said Richard Parker, secretary of the Norton Disney History and Archaeology Group, adding that no similar objects have ever been found. He said that, unlike other dodecahedra, this one is undamaged. \u201cOurs is absolutely in a fabulous condition. It\u2019s complete, undamaged, and it clearly was considered of great value by whoever made it and by those that used it,\u201d Parker said. \u201cSo there must have been a very important reason for it to be deposited in the ground in the way that it was.\u201d Parker told CNN there are no descriptions of the dodecahedron in Roman literature, and they have not been depicted pictorially in mosaics. There are also several features that make it difficult to discern what its intended purpose was. All of the dodecahedra are of different sizes, meaning they were not used for measurement, he said. Because it is undamaged with no signs of wear, it is unlikely to have been a tool, Parker added. Parker\u2019s group does have one working theory, however. \u201cMost likely they were some form of religious or ritual object,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Romans were a very superstitious lot, and generally required signs to allow them to make decisions in their daily lives.\u201d One indication supporting that idea is that the object was found near a small Roman mounted rider god figurine with \u201cstrong religious connections,\u201d Parker said. The artifact was discovered in 1989 by metal detectorists, and the figurine is \u201coften found on temple sites.\u201d The organization plans to return to the dig site later this year to conduct further excavations, which Parker hopes will help establish context on how the area was used. Parker said he is optimistic that the mystery will be solved because this dodecahedron was found in an archaeological excavation area, whereas \u201cmany of those that were found 200 or 300 years ago had no context to where they were found.\u201d \u201cIt is quite a complex story to tell that we\u2019re just starting to tease out,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/29/style/dodecahedron-roman-object-mystery-scn-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}

Dressed as a yellow water lily\u00a0she twirled, sashayed and even did the splits in front of outgoing president Tsai Ing-wen, all while lip-syncing to Lady Gaga\u2019s \u201cMarry the Night\u201d and Taiwanese singer Huang Fei\u2019s \u201cChase, Chase, Chase.\u201d \u201cThis is probably the first presidential office in the world to host a drag show,\u201d Nymphia told Tsai after her performance and thanked Tsai for her service. \u201cThank you for your contributions to this country, so that I could grow up to be like this today,\u201d Nymphia added with tears in her eyes. \u201cThank you for your eight years of dedication, becoming our Taiwan mother.\u201d Taiwan is a vibrant democracy of 24 million people that Beijing\u2019s ruling Communist Party claims as its territory \u2013 despite never having controlled it. But it is not recognized as an independent country by most governments in the world and has lost a string of diplomatic allies to Beijing in recent years. Tsai and her ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) have championed LGBTQ+ rights, making it a more liberal bastion in conservative Asia.\u00a0The self-ruled island is one of the most progressive societies for sexual minorities.\u00a0In a first for the region, Taiwan legalized same-sex marriage in 2019.\u00a0Across the strait, China has been fast moving the opposite direction under Chinese leader Xi Jinping,\u00a0with crackdowns\u00a0on LGBTQ groups and content. Taipei, Taiwan\u2019s capital, hosts East Asia\u2019s largest Pride march every October. Last year, Vice President Lai Ching-te, who will take office on Monday as Taiwan\u2019s next president, became the most senior government leader ever to attend the celebration. Reactions to the spectacle on social media were largely positive. \u201cThank you for allowing us to be at the forefront so that we can proudly show the world how free we are,\u201d said one\u00a0user commenting on Nymphia\u2019s performance on Tsai\u2019s official Facebook account, which concluded with her singing to popstar Jolin Tsai\u2019s gender equality hit \u201cWomxnly\u201d and joined by five of her fellow drag queens. \u201cI wanted to cry at the end; Taiwan has come such a long way from a time where we were called feminine, to having same sex marriage legalized and drag queens performing at the presidential palace today,\u201d wrote another. Not everyone was fan. One user wrote, \u201cI don\u2019t know what drag queens are, but I don\u2019t want my kids to be like this.\u201d While on China\u2019s Weibo, some took issue of the performance taking place in front of the bust of Sun Yat Sen, who is often called the father of modern China and whose legacy is claimed by the governments of both China and Taiwan. Nymphia, the alter-ego of Taiwanese American dressmaker Leo Tsao, was the first East Asian to win \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race,\u201d and she made it a point during her time on the show to raise awareness and appreciation of her cultural background. On the show\u2019s finale she wore a dramatic outfit inspired by bubble tea, one of Taiwan\u2019s biggest cultural exports, and many of her outfits referenced Asian heritage. Nymphia is a well-established artist on Taiwan\u2019s thriving drag scene, known for over-the-top outfits that she creates herself. She has performed in Taiwanese temples and undertook a photoshoot at wet markets dressed as bananas in various stages of ripeness. The tropical fruit is a common motif in Nymphia\u2019s creations that\u2019s become a trademark of sorts. It\u2019s a cheeky reclamation of the sometimes derogatory term used to describe Asians growing up in the West, being yellow on the outside but white on the inside. As she accepted her crown and sceptre on \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d she said: \u201cTo those who feel like they don\u2019t belong, just remember to live fearlessly and have courage to live your truth \u2013 and Taiwan this is for you!\u201d Tsai told Nymphia after her performance: \u201cI want to thank you for demonstrating your fearless beauty, standing up and breaking down barriers,\u201d adding that her story \u201cwill bring courage to many young people in Taiwan, so they stay fearless and stay true to their hearts.\u201d Additional reporting by Reuters.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/style/drag-queen-nymphia-wind-taiwan-president-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}

In an Instagram post Wednesday, Miss Teen USA UmaSofia Srivastava said her \u201cpersonal values no longer fully align with the direction of the organization.\u201d \u201cAfter months of grappling with this decision, I have made the choice to resign from the title of Miss Teen USA 2023,\u201d wrote Srivastava in a statement on her personal account. The high school teen from New Jersey won the pageant back in September and had expressed her pride at being the first Mexican-Indian American to hold the role. \u201cI look forward to the rest of the year as I finish 11th grade as part of the National Honor Society and start the college application process, knowing that my academic career has been defined by my hard work, and my hard work alone,\u201d she added.

Srivastava and the Miss Universe and Miss USA organizations did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Her resignation comes on the heels of another queen relinquishing her title earlier this week.  On Monday, Noelia Voigt stepped down from her Miss USA title, citing her mental health. When she took the crown in November, Voigt, who is Venezuelan American and from Utah, said she would work to connect with diverse communities across the United States. \u201cDeep down I know that this is just the beginning of a new chapter for me, and my hope is that I continue to inspire others to remain steadfast, prioritize your mental health, advocate for yourself and others by using your voice, and never be afraid of what the future holds, even if it feels uncertain,\u201d she posted on Instagram. \u201cNever compromise your physical and mental well-being. Our health is our wealth,\u201d she wrote.

{"id": "2024_05_14_style_alice-munro-dies-92-author-obituary", "text": "Alice Munro, the Nobel Literature Prize winner best known for her mastery of short stories and depictions of womanhood in rural settings, has died in Ontario, Canada, at the age of 92. The news was confirmed to CNN \u201cwith great sadness\u201d by a spokesperson at her publisher, Penguin Random House. Born in 1931 in Wingham, Ontario, Munro grew up on what she described as the \u201ccollapsing enterprise of a fox and mink farm, just beyond the most disreputable part of town\u201d in a 1994 interview with \u201cThe Paris Review.\u201d Amid familial struggles, Munro found an escape in reading as a child. Her early enthusiasm for renowned writers such as Emily Bront\u00eb, Charles Dickens, and Lucy Maud Montgomery, among others, reflected an appreciation for literature beyond her age. \u201cBooks seem to me to be magic, and I wanted to be part of the magic.\u201d she told The Guardian of her childhood reading habits. \u201cBooks were so important to me. They were far more important than life.\u201d As the valedictorian of her high school\u2019s graduating class of 1949, Munro received a two-year scholarship to attend the University of Western Ontario, where she majored in journalism before switching to English. Despite the scholarship initially being a lifeline for Munro, perpetual financial struggles forced her to work as a tobacco picker, a library clerk and even to sell her own blood while studying. After the conclusion of her scholarship, and before her graduation, she married fellow student James Munro and moved with him to Vancouver, where the couple had three children in relatively quick succession (their middle child, Catherine, died shortly after her birth due to kidney complications), and then to Victoria in 1963, where they opened a bookstore. There, Munro wholly immersed herself in literature, namely writers such as Eudora Welty, Flannery O\u2019Connor, and Carson McCullers, whose work Munro told \u201cThe Paris Review\u201d validated her desire to write about rural people in small towns. In addition, she was able to overcome a crippling writer\u2019s block that had plagued her in her twenties \u2014\u202fand had resulted in more abandoned work than finished writing. But it was maternity that led to Munro\u2019s mastery of short stories, not only because familial relationships and domestic lives served as a focal point in many of her works, but also because in her attempt to reconcile her maternal responsibilities with her desire to write, Munro could only set aside short periods of time during her day to craft stories, to the point where she would jot down ideas and drafts during her children\u2019s naps. Munro\u2019s mainstream breakthrough came in 1968 with the publication of her debut short story collection, \u201cDance of the Happy Shades.\u201d A collection of 15 of her earliest stories, the book received critical acclaim and won Canada\u2019s prestigious Governor General\u2019s Award for Fiction in the same year. It largely sets the tone for Munro\u2019s prose; semi-autobiographical in nature and exploring the universality of the human urge for self-discovery, love, and independence, through the mundanity of everyday life in small, rural communities. \u201cWhat you\u2019re getting in a small town is social attitude sort of distilled so you could look at them,\u201d Munro told Canadian broadcaster CBC in 1990. \u201cThe small town is like a stage for human lives.\u201d Throughout her writing career, Munro published 14 short story collections, and was a regular contributor in literary magazines such as \u201cThe New Yorker\u201d and \u201cTamarack Review.\u201d In several of her later collections, such as \u201cThe Moons of Jupiter\u201d and \u201cThe Progress of Love,\u201d Munro experimented with the traditional architecture of short stories and incorporated nonlinear narrative structures. She was also known for constantly editing and revising her stories, even after publication. Several of her short stories were adapted to film, including the 1983 Oscar-winning short \u201cBoys and Girls\u201d and the 2006 Oscar-nominated film \u201cAway from Her.\u201d In 2009, Munro revealed she had been treated for cancer and had undergone coronary bypass surgery. Three years later, she published her final collection of short stories, \u201cDear Life,\u201d which, although a drearier portrayal of small-town lives, served as a literary closure to her semi-autobiographical depictions of womanhood in rural towns. Munro\u2019s mastery of short stories and literature has been lauded by many of her contemporaries. Literary critic James Wood hailed Munro as \u201cour Chekhov,\u201d drawing similarities to the renowned Russian short story writer, while her compatriot and fellow writer Margaret Atwood elevated her to \u201cinternational literary sainthood.\u201d In 2013, Munro was selected as Nobel Laureate in Literature for her body of work spanning seven decades. The Nobel Committee described Munro as a \u201cmaster of the contemporary short story,\u201d whose writing captured \u201cthe feeling of just being a human being.\u201d \u201cI want my stories to move people,\u201d Munro said in her Nobel Lecture in absentia, \u201ceverything the story tells moves the (reader) in such a way that you feel you are a different person when you finish.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/style/alice-munro-dies-92-author-obituary/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "style_article_reuben-wu-landscape-photography", "text": "The first time Reuben Wu saw the warm sandstone hues and vast, open skies of the American West, he was watching the landscapes pass him by from the window of a tour bus.  The British visual artist, now based in Chicago, has become known for his sublime imagery of remote landscapes using drone lighting, enhancing craggy peaks with halos, or writing glyphs in the sky like signals from a supernatural entity. But for a long time, art was just a passion project while he focused on a music career as one of the four members of the synth-pop band Ladytron. \u201c(Photography) started as an all-consuming hobby,\u201d he explained in a phone interview. But when Ladytron took a break in 2011 after five studio albums (they released a self-titled sixth album in 2019, and the seventh, \u201cTime\u2019s Arrow,\u201d this month), he began a new career from scratch. \u201cWhile the others did their own solo projects, making their own music and releasing their own albums, this was my solo project.\u201d Wu\u2019s imagery takes a classic photographer\u2019s combination \u2014 light and landscape \u2014 and marries the two in transformative ways. He often begins with dusky evening light or the ink-black shadows of night, then strategically illuminates portions of the scene with custom-built consumer drones. In one image, a bright horizontal line hangs over a glacier in the Peruvian Andes, revealing the brilliance of the ice against a dark sky. In a different motion piece, Wu simulated an electrical storm in Goblin Valley, Utah, but with perfectly straight strikes of light rather than the jagged bursts of lightning.  The artist\u2019s 2018 photo book \u201cLux Noctis\u201d is in the collections of the Guggenheim and Museum of Modern Art, in New York, and he has shot commercial work for Apple, Audi and Google as well as the DJ and music producer Zedd. Last summer, Wu revealed a colossal project for National Geographic: a cover story and timelapse multimedia piece about Stonehenge, which featured the enigmatic monument lit by his custom drones. In November, one of his NFTs, a 4K video loop titled \u201cAn Irresistible Force,\u201d outperformed its high estimate by over 25% during an auction at Sotheby\u2019s Hong Kong, selling at 441,000 HKD (about $56,500). \u201cI couldn\u2019t have dreamed of where I am now,\u201d Wu said. \u201cI just wanted to be able to make a living from doing art and from doing photography.\u201d  Alien inspiration Wu has always been drawn to wild, remote places where he could find solitude. His parents immigrated from Hong Kong to the UK before he was born, and he grew up an introverted child in Liverpool, he said, who didn\u2019t quite click with school. He was fascinated with science-fiction films that mix the alien with the everyday, such as Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind,\u201d which featured Wyoming\u2019s Devils Tower as a site for extraterrestrial contact. (Unfamiliar with American topography, he initially thought the butte, a national monument, was a fictional geological entity, he explained with a laugh).  The film\u2019s visuals of remote desert scenes mixed with eerie lights have been a formative inspiration in his own work. \u201c(It\u2019s) cemented into my brain, the idea of these seemingly impossible lights moving through the sky, kind of like search lights on very ordinary (American) landscapes,\u201d he said.  He embarked on his first cross-country photography trip across the US in 2013, around a decade after getting a taste on the road with Ladytron. The resulting series featured vivid depictions of the Grand Canyon and South Dakota Badlands, as well as a time-lapse image of Devils Tower at night among star trails.  Two years later, Wu discovered the effect that drone lighting could have on the natural world while working on an outdoor automotive shoot. \u201cI flew the drone up above some cliffs, and I was absolutely fascinated by the effect it had on the actual landscape,\u201d he explained. It made the cliffs glow, reaching areas that were otherwise impossible to light artificially.  Wu rigs lights on drones to suit his needs on any given shoot or project. The first iteration, he said, which he used when the technology was still nascent, was a \u201cmassive\u201d eight-rotor drone outfitted with homemade lights that only had about eight minutes of flight time. The next used a 3D-printed bracket with an LED hot light, but still only gave him an additional two minutes in the air. The tech he uses now gives him a bit more breathing room, with a half hour to fly out, capture images and return to him, but he\u2019s had to learn to work within the bounds of each set-up. \u201cI\u2019m a lot less anxious now, because I\u2019ve crashed a number of drones,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in the end, they\u2019re just tools.\u201d  Experimental series After developing series of still images such as \u201cLux Noctis\u201d and \u201cAeroglyphs,\u201d which experiment with ghostly lighting and geometric shapes in the skies, Wu found himself wanting to incorporate motion and sound into his work because of his own background in music. He began creating 15-second video loops from his images, showing light beams forming patterns or the moon arcing across the sky, to the beats of atmospheric electronic music that he produced. \u201cThese (works) were very much experimental and had no end goal \u2014 they were just things that I did for love out of love,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t license them, I couldn\u2019t print them\u2026 and so they were just there, stacking likes on my Instagram.\u201d But in January 2021, Wu found a way to make them a more substantial part of his career when he was introduced to NFT art. He minted his first \u201cnon-fungible token\u201d  on the marketplace Foundation two months later \u2014 an \u201caeroglyph\u201d of bright lines forming a rectangle above a beachside cliff. It sold for 30 ETH ($45,000), a portion of which he donated to the National Parks Conservation Association and the AAPI Community Fund. Later that year, the web3 arts organization Obscura commissioned him to produce a new set of images titled \u201cAeroglyph Variations,\u201d which took him into the New Mexico badlands for a 20-hour shoot that resulted in 55 images of the same setting, each with different lighting conditions and patterns. Wu has also experimented with presenting the work in different ways, from animations, to AR experiences, to projection mapping moving images onto physical prints. \u201cIt\u2019s very much a hybrid medium, and so I\u2019d like to expand that horizon even more, and think about the end goal for my work,\u201d he said. \u201cAm I creating a nice piece of art for people to look at and appreciate, or am I creating an experience for people to share?\u201d Wu is leaning towards the latter as he continues to experiment with the form his work takes, but no matter the medium, his vision of and approach to the natural world remains consistent. \u201cA lot of people always say that my work is otherworldly \u2014 that is the first word that people think of when they think about my work,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not trying to create an alien-looking image; I\u2019m trying to show that this is our planet. And there are so many new ways that are available to see it that can renew your perspective.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/article/reuben-wu-landscape-photography/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}

The post featured images of her wearing a sequined evening gown, glamorous tiara and sash embroidered with \u201cMiss Universe Saudi Arabia.\u201d Al-Qahtani\u2019s announcement was widely-shared on social media and in news reports; it remains on her social media profiles despite the Miss Universe pageant now challenging its veracity.

{"id": "2024_05_07_style_vintage-red-carpet-fashion", "text": "It\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly when old became the new \u2014 well \u2014 new. But today, as more and more celebrities choose to wear vintage, the all-important stretch of red carpet has started to look more like a museum hallway. At the Grammy\u2019s in February, Miley Cyrus, Laverne Cox and Olivia Rodrigo each arrived in vintage Bob Mackie, Comme des Garcons and Versace respectively. \u201cBig stars in old clothes was the trend of the night,\u201d wrote the New York Times\u2019 fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman. March\u2019s Oscars ceremony was another hotbed of second-hand dressing. Cardi B stepped out at the Vanity Fair after party in a black embellished lace Versace gown from Spring-Summer 2003, while Margot Robbie and Jennifer Lawrence wore Mugler and Givenchy\u00a0\u2014 both from 1996. That\u2019s before taking into account the moments outside of 2024\u00a0 \u2014 Cardi B, again, in Mugler\u2019s 1996 \u201cVenus\u201d shell dress at the 2019 Grammys, or Kim Kardashian in 2022, ascending the Met steps in Marilyn Monroe\u2019s museum-exhibited \u201cHappy Birthday, Mr. President,\u201d gown. More recently, at Monday\u2019s Met Gala, Emily Ratajkowski stepped out onto \u201cThe Garden of Time\u201d themed carpet in a haute couture Versace naked dress from 2001. Part way through the evening, Zendaya made a quick change into a black taffeta Givenchy gown from the same year she was born. But it was Kendall Jenner who made the loudest statement of the night, as she became the first person to wear her vintage 1999 Givenchy look in the public, according to the brand. \u2018The future of fashion\u2019 In reality, A-listers have been digging into the archives of fashion houses for more than two decades. In 2001, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger arrived at the Oscars in a canary yellow 1950s Jean Dess\u00e8s gown. Just behind her was Julia Roberts, minutes away from accepting her Academy Award for \u201cErin Brockovich,\u201d wearing a black velvet Valentino dress with dynamic white piping from 1992. But even industry insiders believe the current appetite for archival looks represents a shift in the fashion ecosystem. \u201cAt the (2024) Oscars, I think we probably saw more people wear archival vintage than ever before.\u201d said Erin Walsh, celebrity stylist to a roster of clients including Anne Hathaway, Selena Gomez and Sarah Jessica Parker, in a video interview with CNN. \u201cIt became the future (of fashion) instantly this year.\u201d One label in particular has been at the forefront of the archival movement. Mugler \u2014 the luxury French fashion house responsible for dressing Zendaya in a 30 kilogram full metal robot suit from 1995. The look, devised for the London premiere of \u201cDune: Part Two,\u201d transcended fashion, making headlines across the internet. According to WWD, the stunt generated a $152 million media impact value for the brand, and was the result of a year\u2019s worth of planning. \u201cEvery year we get countless requests to wear the (Fall-Winter 1997 haute couture) Chimera dress or the robot suit,\u201d Adrian Corsin, managing director of Mugler, told CNN over video call. (The Chimera dress is widely regarded as one of the most expensive couture creations ever made.) \u201cBut it\u2019s really about finding the right moment for us. That was finally the right moment.\u201d Once Mugler agreed to the request made by Zendaya\u2019s stylist and longtime collaborator Law Roach, the logistical talk could begin. What would she wear underneath? The original flesh-toned bodysuit had disappeared over the decades, so they would need a new one to shield Zendaya from the armor\u2019s perspex port holes. How would she get to the venue? The suit doesn\u2019t accommodate bending. Would she be able to walk in the garment? It was initially designed by Jean-Jacques Urcun for a short catwalk strut, while Zendaya needed to climb stairs. But above all else, would she even fit? \u201cThat was the main question,\u201d said Marion Bourd\u00e9e, Mugler\u2019s head of archives. Alterations beyond a slight extension of the legs were off the table, it would either work or it wouldn\u2019t. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t been worn for years and years, and Zendaya\u2019s proportions were quite different from the original model. But at the first fitting we were all quite moved, because it fit like a glove.\u201d Inside the archive Before the look was given a second lease of life, it had spent years in Mugler\u2019s archives \u2014 a secret place somewhere in the center of France that houses more than 6,000 priceless pieces. \u201cIt\u2019s very hidden, you wouldn\u2019t imagine from the outside that it\u2019s there,\u201d said Bourd\u00e9e. \u201cNobody has access to that place. Just Adrian and me.\u201d There, the suit was preserved in a custom box; the inside molded to the shape of each segment like a gun case. \u201cIt floats there basically, in this coffin box,\u201d said Corsin. Although interest in vintage fashion is rising amongst celebrity clients, not everyone is qualified to physically handle these pieces. \u201cUnfortunately there\u2019s some misconception around what a fashion archivist really is,\u201d said Julie Ann Clauss, owner of The Wardrobe\u00a0\u2014 a private LA-based storage service used by brands and individuals alike \u2014 in a video call. \u201cA lot of people use the term really broadly. I have a museum studies degree, and all professional archivists do.\u201d Clauss, who also works as an archivist for Tom Ford, said she was required to take college-level chemistry, as well as learn a second language, before qualifying in her role. \u201cYou need to understand the things that will go wrong if fabrics are stored improperly, or glass beads for example. There are so many different things that happen just as a natural result of chemical reactions between the piece and the environment, or the way it\u2019s handled.\u201d Archival storage spaces, like the one that stowed the 1995 Mugler robot suit, are more than just big closets filled with racks of clothes, too. Clauss\u2019 museum standard facility in LA preserves collections for a range of clients \u2014 from Calvin Klein, Marc Jacobs and Carolina Herrera to musicians and actors. \u201cIt\u2019s very clean, usually very white,\u201d she said. \u201cDust attracts pests. Moths don\u2019t eat garments, they eat protein and that\u2019s what they\u2019re going for on your sweater\u2026 It\u2019s the pieces of your hair, proteinaceous things.\u201d From the temperature down to the humidity, everything is painstakingly controlled to suspend the process of deterioration. Even the light must be filtered. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the lights on, unnecessarily,\u201d said Clauss. \u201cOtherwise you\u2019ll get what\u2019s known as light fugivity\u2026 where exposure causes fibers to weaken and eventually shatter and rip.\u201d Fashion\u2019s rat race But if these one-of-a-kind pieces are so fragile, and the method of their conservation so exact, how do celebrities even get their hands on them? \u201cI don\u2019t loan out,\u201d said Clauss. \u201cBut I get calls from stylists all the time that are under the impression I do. It\u2019s up to my individual clients. I redirect (the request) to the brand\u2019s press team who will make the decision.\u201d Who gets to borrow directly from brands is often a hierarchical question. \u201cRequests have increased a lot,\u201d said Bourd\u00e9e back at Mugler. \u201cSince Cardi, and even more after Kylie. But we want the loans of archives to remain exceptional.\u201d Jenner, who has been loaned three vintage looks by the label, sent a team to scout around the Brooklyn Museum\u2019s 2022 exhibition \u201cThierry Mugler: Couturissime\u201d before it was even finished to select her outfit options for opening night. \u201cWe allowed her stylists to come to the museum while we were still installing the looks on the mannequins, and they chose pieces that they would want to try on Kylie,\u201d Bourd\u00e9e said. But not everyone finds this level of access impressive. In 2022, when Kim Kardashian borrowed Marilyn Monroe\u2019s 1962 gown from Ripley\u2019s Believe It Or Not!, many on social media claimed the dress had been ruined \u2014 spurred on by photos of missing crystals and loose threads. (A few months later, Ripley\u2019s issued a statement insisting the garment did not suffer any damage and was received in that condition when won in a 2016 auction.) The International Council of Museums agreed that in the interest of preservation, historic pieces \u201cshould not be worn by anybody, public or private figures.\u201d Mugler, however, believes the risk is worth the reward. \u201cIf it\u2019s always stuffed away in boxes, people won\u2019t get to enjoy it,\u201d said Corsin. \u201cAnd even in exhibitions, pieces can be damaged,\u201d added Bourd\u00e9e. \u201cPeople fall into the displays.\u201d There are other options, too, says Erin Walsh, for those who are not able to leisurely browse museum-grade archives. \u201cPeople make it sound so mysterious to get great vintage,\u201d she said. \u201cVintage is wildly accessible. I\u2019ve been using (stores) like Shrimpton Couture, New York Vintage or Decades since I started my career 15 years ago.\u201d And while it\u2019s tempting to think the recent uptick in vintage was purely a renewed appreciation of fashion history, Walsh suspects there is a more practical answer for why the desire for older garments has skyrocketed. \u201cThere weren\u2019t enough samples (of current designer pieces),\u201d she said. \u201cIt seems like everybody\u2019s in a rat race to finish something very quickly, or there\u2019s not enough that can be made.\u201d Between awards season and fashion week preparation, Walsh believes designers are buckling under the increasing pace of the industry. \u201cThis need for pulling archive pieces, it really just highlights what\u2019s happening in the fashion marketplace. There\u2019s too many (events) for people to go to. We\u2019re being put into a situation where I don\u2019t think anybody can keep up with it. We\u2019re having to go with a different solution, there\u2019s no other way to keep up with demand.\u201d According to The Hollywood Reporter, fashion showrooms were reportedly \u201cwiped clean\u201d in January, following a backlog in press tours, premieres and events caused by the SAG-AFTRA strike last autumn. \u201cNobody was doing anything, then suddenly all the awards were at the same time. Anybody who was on the award circuit or who works in fashion didn\u2019t have one weekend off in three months,\u201d said Walsh. But whether it was born out of necessity or not, the cultural kudos an exclusive archival pull can bestow is powerful \u2014 for both the brand and the wearer. At the Met Gala, Kendall Jenner\u2019s vintage Givenchy gown made instant headlines across the internet. \u201cIt\u2019s such a special moment,\u201d she told Vogue on the night. \u201cI feel extremely honored that they\u2019re allowing me to wear it.\u201d And the more precious the garment, the more prestigious the outfit. Is there anything Mugler would never consider loaning, even for Zendaya or the Jenners? \u201cNever say never,\u201d Corsin said. \u201cEven the Chimera, one of the most coveted pieces in fashion history of the 20th century. All I can say for the moment is it hasn\u2019t been loaned out.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/07/style/vintage-red-carpet-fashion/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_style_india-elections-purple-voter-ink-intl-hnk", "text": "India\u2019s massive, twice-a-decade exercise in democracy is once again leaving its mark on the country\u2019s people, in the form of purple-streaked index fingers. The Election Commission uses indelible ink, or \u201cvoter ink\u201d, to prevent fraud or duplicate votes. Once a voter arrives at the booth to cast their ballot and has their ID verified, the ink is painted across the top of their left index finger, leaving a stain that can take up to two weeks to wash off. It may be rudimentary, but the method has been so effective that it\u2019s been in place for more than seven decades. \u201cRight from the prime minister to the most common person, everybody flashes their (marked) finger,\u201d said K Mohammed Irfan, managing director of Mysore Varnish and Paints Limited (MVPL), the state-owned company that exclusively makes and distributes the liquid to polling booths across the nation. \u201cFrom celebrities to film stars\u2026 (it has become) a mark of democracy that I think is synonymous with elections,\u201d he told CNN in a video interview. More than 960 million people are eligible to vote in India\u2019s election, the world\u2019s biggest. And workers at the company\u2019s factory in Mysuru, a city in southwestern Karnataka state, have spent months preparing nearly 2.7 million ink\u00a0vials, its largest order to date. The orange containers were filled and carefully packed for distribution ahead of this year\u2019s elections, which are underway and end\u00a0June 1. Each vial contains enough liquid to mark approximately 700 voters. The key to the ink\u2019s literal staying power? A tightly guarded formula which has remained unchanged since 1951. \u201cIndelible ink serves no other purpose,\u201d said Irfan. \u201cWe only manufacture the required quantity.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0While Irfan says the company is \u201cbound to secrecy\u201d when it comes to the ink\u2019s exact composition, it does contain the chemical compound silver nitrate, which causes a purplish stain when it comes into contact with skin and is exposed to sunlight. One dab at a time When newly independent India held its first-ever general elections in 1951 and 1952, organizers turned to the idea of using indelible ink to mark voters, in efforts to ensure a fair ballot. \u201cIn a country where there was no systematic registration of births, or identity documents, and with millions of people on the move as refugees, the question of how to prevent impersonation and double voting was a source of great concern,\u201d said Ornit Shani, author of \u201cHow India Became Democratic: Citizenship and the Making of the Universal Franchise.\u201d Some officials thought the method would take too much time and complicate the voting process, according to Shani, but public opinion eventually won out. \u201cCombined with the practice that all voters, irrespective of their caste, class and religions would stand in the same line, (having to wait) for their turn to have their finger marked (before they) cast their vote, further contributed to making concrete and visible the core value of the equality of the vote,\u201d Shani said in an email to CNN. \u201cOne man, one woman, one vote.\u201d Lasting appeal MVPL was founded as a paint supplier in 1937 by the then maharaja or ruler of Mysore, Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV, and retains that side\u00a0of its business. According to Irfan, when the company isn\u2019t producing ink, it\u2019s supplying, among other products, paint for the public transport sector. The ink\u2019s appeal has spilled beyond India\u2019s borders too. The company now supplies indelible ink to more than 35 countries, including to Ghana beginning in the late 1970s. However, Ghana\u2019s election commission recently announced it would phase out the use of indelible ink, opting for biometric verification methods instead. But the use of the ink in India doesn\u2019t appear to be going away any time soon. For Mukulika Banerjee, an associate professor of anthropology at the London School of Economics, the practice of marking a body may not translate well in other cultures, but it works in India due to common\u00a0cultural practices. \u201cPeople routinely have their hands decorated with henna, or women have their feet decorated with different colors,\u201d said Banerjee in a phone interview. \u201cI would argue that the marking of the finger (semi-permanently) kind of fits into it in a way that it might not fit in other contexts.\u201d She also pointed to an unintentional effect of marking voters with ink: creating an environment of peer pressure. Banerjee was able to find instances of this during her research on democracy and elections in West Bengal. \u201cFirst thing on polling day people do is check out each other\u2019s fingers,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if your left index finger is not carrying the indelible mark, they\u2019ll look at you and the first thing they\u2019ll say is \u2018Why haven\u2019t you voted?\u2019 \u201cYou can make excuses, but by the fifth time in the day, if somebody asks you and it gets so annoying, it\u2019s actually easier to go and vote than to not vote.\u201d The peer pressure extends to movie stars and athletes, who are likely to post their ink-stained fingers to their millions of fans on social media. \u201cThese guys have begun to hold up (their fingers) and take selfies of having voted and say \u2018I\u2019ve voted, have you?\u2019 because they feel they have a civic duty to encourage others to vote as well,\u201d she added. \u201cSo it becomes aspirational; then you want to be like your hero and you want to be able to do the same thing.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/india-elections-purple-voter-ink-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_style_vandals-target-oldest-chinese-dragon-in-australian-intl-hnk", "text": "Australian police are seeking two people for allegedly vandalizing a century-old Chinese parade dragon and other valuable artefacts at a museum in a small town known for its historic links to China. The vandalism took place last week at the Golden Dragon Museum in Bendigo, about 100 miles northwest of Melbourne, according to the police and head of the museum. Victoria Police said a man and a woman are suspected of damaging AUD$100,000 ($66,900) worth of art and historical items, before making off in a silver Toyota Prado on May 5. \u201cInvestigators believe the duo used a liquid to cause damage to multiple statues and paintings,\u201d police said, adding that the suspects were with two children at the time. Among the artefacts attacked was Loong \u2013 described by the museum as the \u201coldest complete imperial processional dragon in the world.\u201d \u201cLoong\u201d is a sacred mythical creature in Chinese culture \u2013 usually translated as dragon in English \u2013 and is often the protagonist in festivities and rituals. Dragon dances have been documented at ceremonial events since the Han Dynasty (202 BCE to 220 CE) and often involve teams of dancers manipulating a giant dragon puppet through the streets. Bendigo, currently a city of some 100,000 people, has had Chinese residents for more than a century. Chinese immigrants first arrived mostly from southern China in the mid-1800s during the Victorian goldrush and at one point made up 20 percent of the town\u2019s residents. Miners and merchants brought their customs and culture with them to a place they once called \u201cDai Gum San\u201d - or \u201cBig Gold Mountain,\u201d according to Bendigo Tourism. To this day, a large dragon parade is held every Easter to raise money for a local hospital. The Golden Dragon Museum was opened in 1991 \u201cto document, interpret and preserve the Chinese heritage in Australia\u201d according to the museum\u2019s website. Loong, which dates back 1901, was routinely paraded through the streets of Victoria until the 1970s when it was retired. Hugo Leschen, Chief Executive Officer of the museum, told CNN that they found oily liquid running down Loong\u2019s nose. Its successor Sun Loong, which took over to parade around the Bendigo until it was also retired in 2019, was also damaged, Leschen said, citing stains on the second dragon\u2019s tongue. Other parts of the museum were also targeted. Security camera footage aired on CNN affiliate Nine News showed a woman clad in a white sweater and grey beanie splashing liquid at a Buddhist altar. A man stood next to her in the clip. Stains were also found on at least 35 paintings and several statues of Chinese deities in the temple as well as a garden next door managed by the museum, Leschen said. \u201cWith these further attacks it is now evident that this was no random act of mindless vandalism but rather a planned and sustained malicious attack across various heritage, cultural and religious sites for reasons unknown,\u201d he said. The Chinese Community Council of Australia condemned the vandalism in a statement. While police have yet to comment on the motivation, the group is concerned the act \u201cmay have been racially motivated.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/style/vandals-target-oldest-chinese-dragon-in-australian-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}

And while many artists long to share their work with the world, there\u2019s no guarantee that the audience will understand it, or even like it. That certainly seems to be the case with a painting by indigenous artist Vincent Namatjira, which includes a portrait of Australia\u2019s richest person, mining magnate Gina Rinehart. Rinehart has reportedly called for the National Gallery of Australia (NGA) to remove her portrait, one of 21 individual works that make up a single piece in Namatjira\u2019s exhibition \u201cAustralia in Colour,\u201d from display. The exhibition has been running at the gallery in the Australian capital, Canberra, since March. Other subjects in the piece include the late Queen Elizabeth II, American musician Jimi Hendrix, Australian Aboriginal rights activist Vincent Lingiari and the former Prime Minister of Australia Scott Morrison. Australian media has reported that Rinehart approached the NGA\u2019s director and chair to request the painting\u2019s removal. The NGA said in a statement to CNN Thursday that it \u201cwelcomes the public having a dialogue on our collection and displays.\u201d \u201cSince 1973, when the National Gallery acquired Jackson Pollocks\u2019 Blue Poles, there has been a dynamic discussion on the artistic merits of works in the national collection, and/or on display at the Gallery,\u201d the NGA statement continued. \u201cWe present works of art to the Australian public to inspire people to explore, experience and learn about art.\u201d Namatjira said in a statement that he paints \u201cpeople who are wealthy, powerful, or significant \u2013 people who have had an influence on this country, and on me personally, whether directly or indirectly, whether for good or for bad.\u201d \u201cI paint the world as I see it,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t have to like my paintings, but I hope they take the time to look and think, \u2018why has this Aboriginal bloke painted these powerful people? What is he trying to say?\u2019\u201d \u201cSome people might not like it, other people might find it funny but I hope people look beneath the surface and see the serious side too,\u201d Namatjira added. Rinehart is the executive chairman of Hancock Prospecting, a privately owned mining company that was founded by her father, Lang Hancock. CNN has reached out to Hancock Prospecting for comment but did not receive a response. Rinehart has an estimated net worth of $30.2 billion USD, according to Forbes. She \u201cremained unshakable\u201d at the top of Forbes\u2019 Australia\u2019s 50 Richest list for 2024, the outlet reported in February.

The 3.3 million square-meter Al Khuwair Muscat Downtown and Waterfront development will include a residential complex, a marina, a cultural district, numerous canal walkways and a ministerial campus. Work is set to start at the end of this year and the area is expected to house more than 60,000 people when completed. ZHA\u2019s associate director, architect Paolo Zilli, told CNN he spent around a year finalizing the model he presented to Oman\u2019s Ministry of Housing and Urban Planning. Central to ZIlli\u2019s design was facilitating access to public transport. \u201cThe vision is actually to remove all the cars, to remove all the fences and to create a campus of the ministry with many functions that can attract families and a new generation,\u201d he said. ZHA says it will encourage pedestrians by providing shading and passive cooling, and incorporate infrastructure to improve cycling safety. The use of onsite solar power will be \u201cmaximized\u201d and native plant species will be conserved and restored. Oman\u2019s economy has long depended on oil, but it is now investing heavily in real-estate projects to drive more foreign investment, and ultimately boost non-oil revenues, part of the country\u2019s National Vision 2040 strategy. In Muscat, the population is projected to increase from 1.5 million to 2.7 million by that year. \u201cThere are a lot of changes,\u201d Dr. Khalfan bin Saeed bin Mubarak al-Shueili, Oman\u2019s Minister of Housing and Urban Planning, told CNN. \u201cWe [are] going to change the economy based on talent and capability skills and maybe also the digital sector. \u201cIn Muscat itself, we anticipate the requirement of another 300,000 homes.

These are just three of the models who have graced the cover of Sports Illustrated\u2019s famous \u2014 and at times controversial \u2014 \u201cSwimsuit Edition.\u201d Now, to celebrate the special issue\u2019s 60th year in print, the magazine has unveiled seven new covers featuring 27 women and reuniting past cover models for a \u201cLegends\u201d photo shoot. Kate Upton, Chrissy Teigen, plus-size model Hunter McGrady, and CBS News host Gayle King all posed for their own solo covers.

{"id": "2024_05_11_style_miss-usa-pageant-organization-allegations", "text": "During their year of service, pageant queens are highly visible, making appearances at major events, advocating for important causes and speaking at public engagements, all in an official capacity. But following the shocking double resignation of Miss USA 2023 Noelia Voigt and Miss Teen USA 2023 UmaSofia Srivastava this week, just days apart, insiders are painting a picture of national titleholders kept absent from their usual duties, their organization in disarray, and key players who appear to be unable to voice their experiences \u2014 and concerns. The Miss USA organization, which runs both pageants, has come under fire amid accusations of mismanagement, a hostile work environment, and conditions that led, in particular, to Voigt\u2019s resignation on the grounds that her role was impacting her mental health. While Srivastava, 16, who represented New Jersey at Miss Teen USA, released a statement on Instagram saying that her personal values \u201cno longer fully align\u201d with those of the organization, Voigt, 24, who represented Utah at Miss USA, wrote a long but cryptic post, citing her mental health. Soon, however, it went viral for an apparent hidden message \u2014 the first letter of the first 11 sentences spelled out \u201cI am silenced.\u201d (Voigt has not subsequently addressed this speculation.) \u201cWe respect and support Noelia\u2019s decision to step down from her duties,\u201d the Miss USA pageant said in a statement following Voigt\u2019s announcement. \u201cThe well-being of our titleholders is a top priority, and we understand her need to prioritize herself at this time.\u201d The organization has not returned CNN\u2019s request for further comment. In response, a number of current state titleholders who competed alongside Voigt for Miss USA \u2014 including Miss North Carolina USA 2023 Jordyn Ashlee McKey, Miss Wisconsin USA 2023 Alexis Loomans and Miss New York USA, Rachelle di Stasio \u2014 shared social media messages in support of Voigt, asking the organization to \u201crelease Noelia from the confidentiality NDA clause of her contract, in perpetuity, so that she is free to speak on her experiences and time as Miss USA.\u201d Denise White, a PR representative for both Srivastava and Voigt \u2014 and the 1994 Miss Oregon USA \u2014 alleged that both winners are restricted by \u201cironclad\u201d non-disclosure agreements in their contracts. To date, neither Voigt or Srivastava has publicly revealed more about what led them to quit. But in a resignation letter provided to the Miss USA organization and obtained by CNN, Voigt outlined a number of concerns, ranging from frustrating managerial issues to more serious allegations. In it, she described a \u201ctoxic work environment\u201d that \u201cat best, is poor management and, at worst, is bullying and harassment.\u201d She accused the pageant\u2019s CEO, Laylah Rose, of \u201cslandering\u201d her character in conversations with people inside and outside of the organization, including calling Voigt \u201cmentally ill.\u201d Rose is an entrepreneur and CEO of the VIP Pageantry Network, who took over the brand in 2023. Voigt says Rose\u2019s communications to her were \u201ccold and unnecessarily aggressive,\u201d and that she never received a formal meeting about her responsibilities. Despite the lack of communication about her role, she was \u201cconstantly\u2026 threatened with disciplinary action, including taking away my salary,\u201d according to the document. The organization failed to arrange travel accommodations for Voigt on multiple occasions, she wrote, and did not provide her with an apartment and car for months, as had been outlined in her prize package. Nor did she have an \u201ceffective handler,\u201d she claimed, the latter leading to an instance where Voigt says she was sexually harassed during a Christmas parade event in Sarasota, Florida, while alone with an unnamed person in a car. According to Voigt\u2019s letter, Rose is \u201cactively building a culture of fear and control, the antithesis of women\u2019s empowerment, that is\u2026unsafe for future titleholders and employees.\u201d Nor, she wrote, can she publicly voice her concerns, saying she is \u201csilenced contractually from being able to speak up for myself.\u201d \u2018Things are falling apart\u2019 Voigt and Srivastava\u2019s respective resignations were not coordinated, according to White. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve witnessed and seen is harassment, a toxic work environment and bullying,\u201d White said in a telephone interview with CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s just not conducive to a women\u2019s organization that uplifts women and is supposed to promote using your voice. It\u2019s quite the opposite.\u201d Both pageant winners sought out support from management at Miss Universe, which owns the Miss USA organization, without success, she added. \u201cBoth young ladies were always trying to resolve any issues quietly behind the scenes,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe fact that Miss Universe Organization has not even responded to Noelia\u2019s resignation at this point is just stonewalling\u2026 No wonder things are falling apart. Because nobody knows what to do.\u201d The Miss Universe organization and Rose, through Miss USA, did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Voigt\u2019s pageant coach, Thom Brodeur, who has worked with Miss USA contestants since 1991 and began working with Voigt while she was preparing for Miss Utah, emphasized new and ominous territory for the organization under Rose. \u201cNo woman has ever resigned as Miss USA or as Miss Teen USA, and she\u2019s lost both of them in 48 hours,\u201d he said. Even before Voigt and Srivastava stepped down, there was turmoil in the organization, according to White, Brodeur and Miss USA\u2019s former social media director, Claudia Engelhardt, who also resigned in recent days. Engelhardt claimed on Instagram that she had worked without pay for two months after being hired, and that she had seen a \u201cdecline\u201d in Voigt\u2019s mental health, and witnessed \u201cdisrespect\u201d toward Srivastava and members of her family. And according to Engelhardt, they were far from the only members of the Miss USA organization to depart. When she began her role in January, she was part of an already small team of five employees. Now, she says, after multiple firings and resignations, the team is down to Rose and one other employee. Multiple sources said the turnover has been constant. \u201cThis is not a state pageant. This is not a local pageant. You need\u2026 a whole team,\u201d Engelhardt said in a phone call with CNN. Engelhardt said she believed she was applying for a freelance role, and was surprised to find she was being hired as staff. Still, she claimed, she received no employee contract, no onboarding and no guidance. There was no one else to help her manage the day-to-day social media needs of the national brand, she said, and often came up against what she framed as Rose\u2019s overbearing approach to their social accounts. \u201cShe would block Instagram accounts with people that she had personal discrepancies with. She would censor comments, and she would leave comments for the Miss USA page as if she was Noelia,\u201d Engelhardt claimed. White also alleged that Rose impersonated the two pageant winners on their official accounts. Weeks before Voigt resigned, she announced in a now-deleted Instagram post on her personal account that she \u201cno longer had access\u201d to her Miss USA pages. An uneasy path forward Engelhardt said she witnessed firsthand the impact of the role on Voigt, who she considers a friend as well as a former colleague. \u201c(I saw) how stressed out she would get when the owner would constantly bombard her with emails,\u201d she recalled. \u201cShe was constantly living in an anxious state.\u201d But despite the day-to-day stressors, Voigt alleged that she only made few public appearances. She said in her letter that, aside from a handful of press interviews in Los Angeles following her win and subsequent ones in Utah, the state she had represented at the Miss USA pageant, she had \u201cyet to make an appearance outside of Sarasota, Florida,\u201d where she was living. This was due to a \u201clack of communication\u201d that she found \u201cbaffling,\u201d she wrote. \u201cOur Miss USA, who should have been booked and busy (with) endless opportunities was sitting around doing nothing, and it\u2019s not because she didn\u2019t want to, but because of mismanagement,\u201d Engelhardt said. On May 9, the Miss USA pageant announced that Savannah Gankiewicz, Miss Hawaii USA 2023 and first-runner up to Voigt at the 2023 Miss USA pageant, would be taking over the national title and its responsibilities. She will be officially crowned on May 15. \u201cWe are proud to crown Savannah Miss USA 2023, A true representation of vision, intelligence, and compassion,\u201d Rose said in a statement. \u201cHer dedication to empowering women through self-love and confidence is inspiring, and we look forward to her impactful reign as Miss USA.\u201d \u201cI fully support and respect Noelia\u2019s decision to step down, and I stand in solidarity with mental health awareness,\u201d Gankiewicz\u00a0added. \u201cTo my fellow Miss USA sisters, I believe it\u2019s crucial for us to stand united for the future of the organization and the incoming class of 2024 and beyond.\u201d Though many have offered their public support for the two resigned pageant winners \u2014 including\u00a0Shanna Moakler, who oversaw Voigt\u2019s win in her role as the state director for the Miss Utah USA pageant, and Cindy Provost and Debbie Miller, who oversaw Srivastava\u2019s win in their role as state directors for the Miss New Jersey Teen USA pageant \u2014 Engelhardt and White both hope that others will step up to reveal more about what they see as a stifling culture, as well as potential legal ramifications, that are keeping the titleholders quiet. \u201cThey need somebody else to speak up for them,\u201d White said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/style/miss-usa-pageant-organization-allegations/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "style_alopecia-in-art-history-wellness", "text": "At least 40% of women experience\u00a0hair loss or alopecia over their lifetimes. This could be alopecia areata (patchy hair loss), traction alopecia (strained hair loss) or another form. The different ways that women\u2019s hair loss has been depicted across art history demonstrates the many different ways it has been interpreted over the years. In 16th and 17th century Britain, for example, women\u2019s alopecia was sometimes interpreted as\u00a0retribution for sins, including adultery. Some historical art, however, depicts a more neutral, or even positive, attitude towards women\u2019s alopecia. In religious or mythical art, it was sometimes idealized as divine. \u201cMadonna and Child\u201d (pictured top), painted in the 15th century by Italian Renaissance artist Carlo Crivelli, shows Jesus and Mary embracing in a gold, stylized setting. The pair sit behind a religious altar surrounded by ripe fruit and adorned with halos. Madonna has a high forehead and her blonde hair recedes, particularly on her right temple. This association between alopecia and divinity is echoed in a work by another Renaissance Italian artist, Cosm\u00e8 Tura. His\u00a0\u201dMadonna and Mary Magdalene\u201d\u00a0(circa 1490) depicts both mother and child with prominent foreheads. A glazed terracotta piece created by the Italian sculptor Andrea della Robbia in 1475 features Prudence, a human embodiment of Christian morality, as a balding two-headed person. Baldness in women has been connected to the divine for various reasons. It took the emphasis off of personal appearance in favour of deeper, more spiritual, priorities. But intentional hair removal played a role too. For some religious people, such as Buddhist nuns and Haredi Jewish wives, a bald head is thought to be\u00a0purer\u00a0and shaving can represent a\u00a0regular, sacrificial ritual. Ancient depictions Artwork on the walls of the tomb of the ancient Egyptian pharaoh, Akhenaten who ruled from 1351 to 1334 B.C., depicts two of his daughters, naked, with bald heads. Head shaving as well as natural baldness was common among the ancient Egyptians, including women. In fact, ancient Egyptians had\u00a0distinct terms\u00a0for female and male alopecia. This attests to just how common baldness, head shaving and wig wearing were for both sexes in ancient Egypt. And it isn\u2019t just Egypt. Partial and full head shaving has historically been common among women across sub-Saharan Africa. As\u00a0one traveller observed\u00a0among the inhabitants of the 18th century Kingdom of Issini (modern-day Ghana): \u201cSome only shave one half of the head \u2026 Others leave broad patches here and there unshaved.\u201d Medieval and Renaissance alopecia The 15th century painting, \u201cPortrait of a Woman with a Man at a Casement,\u201d by the Italian artist, Fra Filippo Lippi, features an aristocratic profile of a woman facing a man. She has a prominent forehead and high hairline. The appearance of recessed frontal hairlines in Medieval and Renaissance Europe\u00a0may have been fashionable\u00a0and even considered a sign of intelligence, encouraging customs of forehead shaving and eyebrow plucking. The 16th century queen of England, Elizabeth I, was often painted in this way.\u00a0One undated oil portrait\u00a0of the British monarch depicts her in bejeweled robes, with a pearl emblazoned veil and a prominent forehead. The removal of female bodily hair at this time, including on the forehead, wasn\u2019t just a matter of fashion. It also arguably arose due to patriarchal ideas that women\u2019s body hair was\u00a0dirty and even dangerous to men. Modern alopecia Adverts\u00a0and\u00a0research\u00a0today tend to discuss hair loss exclusively through medical terms, as a kind of detrimental disease. A recent\u00a0BBC article\u00a0refers to people with alopecia areata as \u201cpatients\u201d and their experience of it as \u201cprofoundly challenging\u201d. This certainly reflects some experiences, but not those who interpret their hair loss more neutrally, or even with\u00a0pride. Pharmaceutical and cosmetic products are promoted as \u201cnecessary\u201d treatments. A newly licensed drug, litfulo or ritlecitinib, was\u00a0hailed\u00a0last month as the \u201cfirst treatment\u201d and \u201cmedicine\u201d for alopecia. But as many forms of alopecia are not delimiting and as the \u201ctreatments\u201d on offer have limited efficacy and potential safety issues, this should\u00a0not be the default response. For example, the\u00a0European Medicine Agency\u00a0notes that ritlecitinib results in 80% hair regrowth but only for 36% of people taking it. About 10% are at risk of diarrhea, acne and throat infections. Another study\u00a0noted that\u00a0similar alopecia drugs, that operate through immunosuppression, only seem to work if they are taken continuously, yet their long-term safety has not been established. Depictions of alopecia throughout art history are a reminder of the many complicated ways women\u2019s hair loss has been viewed. Sometimes weaponized as a way to shame women, sometimes venerated as a sign of the divine, the truth is that hair loss really indicates nothing about a woman\u2019s worth, morality or status. But historical depictions of women\u2019s alopecia and baldness provide hope. They show that alopecia has been conceptualized differently at different times. This means the current framing of alopecia as an inevitably disadvantaging disease in need of certain \u201ctreatments\u201d might be biased too. They suggest if our societal interpretation of alopecia improves (as something that shouldn\u2019t be stigmatized), then so too may the individual experience (as something that shouldn\u2019t be dreaded).", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/alopecia-in-art-history-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "style_yushi-li-the-smothering-dream-snap", "text": " A group of men lie at the foot of a sofa, their naked bodies peeking out through a carpet of rose petals. Some look toward the photograph\u2019s protagonist, an Asian woman in a lime green dress laying across the cushioned loveseat. Others gaze away, seemingly indifferent, as if caught in some sort of hazy spell. Despite Chinese photographer Yushi Li\u2019s gentle staging, her title for the photograph, \u201cThe Smothering Dream,\u201d suggests something more sinister is at play. Referencing Dutch painter Lawrence Alma-Tadema\u2019s 1888 work \u201cThe Roses of Heliogabalus,\u201d in which a Roman emperor watches on as unsuspecting banquet guests slowly suffocate in flowers, Li\u2019s modern take \u2014 shot on a set awash with pastel colors and delicate furniture \u2014 is equally deceptive at first glance. Li, is not only the photographer, but also the muse at the center of the image. \u201cI made this very pink and kitsch dream,\u201d she said, describing the London living room set in a phone interview. \u201cBut underneath it, there is, like, some kind of violence. It\u2019s a fantasy of love and eroticism\u2026 smothering these men I desire.\u201d Shot in 2022, \u201cThe Smothering Dream\u201d was recently on show at Photofairs Shanghai as part of a group exhibition called \u201cA Quiet Gaze.\u201d It was a fitting title to showcase the work of an artist for whom an examination of the male and female gazes has been a recurring theme. Li\u2019s wider portfolio of subversive images include softly-lit nude portraits of strangers she scouted through a dating app (a series titled \u201cMy Tinder Boys\u201d). Stripped of their clothes and therefore their character, she said, the men lounge around their homes doing banal tasks: one scoops out of a fresh watermelon, while another casually balances a plate of spaghetti over his private parts. The series is partly a response to erotic images objectifying women that are historically ubiquitous in art, advertisements and photography. Although a canon of male nudes does exist, it largely comprises images shot by gay male photographers. When Li began the series in 2017, she noticed a lack of images depicting naked men as objects of desire from a woman\u2019s perspective. After some mistook her work as being shot by a male photographer, she began inserting herself into the photos \u2014 fully clothed alongside naked counterparts, and often the only person looking directly at the camera. \u201cInstead of being a passive, \u2018looked-at\u2019 thing, I want to be the one who is in control, who is creating the story, who is expressing my fantasy,\u201d said Li. Her images have also pushed back against the longstanding fetishization of Asian women, often by Western men, something Li said she has experienced first-hand: \u201cI\u2019m a small person, and come across as quiet, so I kind of fit the stereotype.\u201d Li, who was born in China\u2019s Hunan province and now lives in the UK. She said she feels flattered when women reach out to her online to say they feel empowered by her photographs. \u201cAs a woman, especially as an Asian or Chinese woman, you (should be able to) feel that you can also express your erotic desire.\u201d Who\u2019s in power? Li has been fascinated with how the idea of the gaze has, today, become \u201cless binary.\u201d She has also been examining and playing with the way classical paintings depict power dynamics, portrayals of desire and representations of the body. She brings these ideas into \u201cPaintings, Dreams and Love,\u201d an ongoing project to which \u201cThe Smothering Dream\u201d belongs. (A second photo from the same shoot, entitled \u201cAfter the Dream,\u201d hints at what has just taken place, with satin cushions and wilted petals strewn about the scene). Other sources of inspiration include Swiss painter Henry Fuseli\u2019s 1781 \u201cThe Nightmare,\u201d showing an incubus crouching menacingly atop a sleeping woman, and \u201cThe Death of Actaeon,\u201d Renaissance painter Titian\u2019s 16th-century oil painting of the Romans\u2019 goddess of the hunt, Diana, transforming the Theban hero into a stag that is then killed by his own hounds. In Li\u2019s reinterpretations, she is in full control. In the former, she wears a tight, red turtleneck as she casually sits on an unsuspecting male figure, thwarting the idea of seduction. In the latter, she strikes a calm, calculated pose, pointing a bow and arrow at a naked man in a window. But control, Li says, is subjective in images where multiple gazes can co-exist. \u201cSome of these men (in the photographs) also look at me, and the viewer also looks at all of us,\u201d she said. The internet age, she added, has only further complicated matters. \u201cNow you can look at so many things like instantly, everywhere, or wherever, whenever you want\u2026 it\u2019s something very different, it\u2019s not (just) a physical thing, it\u2019s a digital thing. \u201cThere\u2019s also the gaze from the algorithm, and the gaze from the screen that reflects yourself when you look at it\u2026 the internet (means) we\u2019re subjected to the gaze more, in a way.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/yushi-li-the-smothering-dream-snap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_style_queen-camilla-no-fur-gbr-scli-intl", "text": "Buckingham Palace has written to an animal rights group to confirm that Queen Camilla will no longer buy clothes that include animal pelts. The letter sent to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), and seen by CNN, said that: \u201cHer Majesty will not procure any new fur garments.\u201d It is unclear, however, what the Queen\u2019s position is with regard to fur items in her existing wardrobe. The move follows a similar stand taken by her late mother-in-law, Queen Elizabeth II, who ruled out buying new fur products back in 2019. The palace\u2019s correspondence was in response to a letter sent by PETA to the Queen in April. In it, Elisa Allen, vice president of the organization\u2019s UK programs and operations, detailed the cruel practices which, it says, are employed in the fur industry, as well its impact on the environment.

{"id": "2024_05_17_style_unseen-photos-royal-family-gbr-scli-intl", "text": "As Queen for 70 years, Elizabeth II was probably one of the most photographed women in history. Yet almost two years after her death, new pictures of Britain\u2019s longest-reigning monarch have emerged for an exhibition opening at Buckingham Palace this week. Among the most striking is a touching image from 1964 of four royal mothers and their babies - including the Queen and her youngest son, Prince Edward. Alongside them are the Queen\u2019s sister, Princess Margaret, plus Princess Alexandra and the Duchess of Kent, all holding their newborn babies. The never-before-seen image was taken by Princess Margaret\u2019s then-husband, photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones - or Lord Snowdon as he was known as then - as a personal thanks for the royal obstetrician who delivered the four babies within two months of that year. Shown alongside it is a handwritten letter from Princess Margaret to her sister in which she asks \u201cDarling Lilibet\u201d to sign a print \u201cas a souvenir of an extraordinary two months of delivery.\u201d \u201cRoyal Portraits: A Century of Photography,\u201d which opened in The King\u2019s Gallery of the palace on Friday, has more than 150 items from the Royal Collection and Royal Archives, which chart the evolution of royal portrait photography since the 1920s. Also on show for the first time are several wartime images taken by Cecil Beaton, who captured the royal family on camera over six decades. Among them is one of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth inspecting bomb damage at the palace in 1940, while another shows them with their two daughters - Elizabeth and Margaret - around the King\u2019s desk at the Royal Lodge in Windsor. Beaton was the official photographer for Elizabeth\u2019s coronation in 1953. The exhibition features a contact sheet of proofs of the coronation sitting, alongside a note from Martin Charteris, the Queen\u2019s assistant private secretary, recommending to Prince Philip which images should be sent to the royal family and maids of honor. The picture that was subsequently chosen and sent to the Queen Mother can also be seen, signed by both the Queen, her husband and Beaton. In a week where many headlines were made about the new official painting of the King, the exhibition offers an altogether different view of Charles. It features a black and white shot of Charles, then a young prince, alongside his sister, Princess Anne, in 1956. There are numerous official photographs taken to mark royal birthdays, including a portrait by Beaton of Princess Margaret for her 25th birthday - together with her dog Pippin.  Separately, she and her sister, the Queen, can be seen laughing and talking in a contact sheet of images shot by Norman Parkinson on the occasion of their mother\u2019s 80th birthday. Another highlight is the earliest surviving color print of a member of the royal family. Taken in 1935 by pioneering female photographer Madame Yevonde, it shows Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester - sister-in-law to King George VI and Edward VIII - on her wedding day. The exhibition, which runs until October, charts the innovations in portraiture, featuring Andy Warhol\u2019s 1985 image of the Queen sprinkled with diamond dust and Rankin\u2019s 2001 photograph of the smiling monarch, superimposed against the union flag. Meanwhile, Paolo Roversi\u2019s memorable 40th birthday portrait of the Princess of Wales, shows Catherine bearing a striking resemblance to Alexandra, Princess of Wales, by Franz Xaver Winterhalter in 1864. Curator Alessandro Nasini said in a press release: \u201cThe Royal Collection holds some of the most enduring photographs ever taken of the Royal Family, captured by the most celebrated portrait photographers of the past hundred years \u2013 from Dorothy Wilding and Cecil Beaton to Annie Leibovitz, David Bailey, and Rankin. \u201cAlongside these beautiful vintage prints, which cannot be on permanent display for conservation reasons, we are excited to share archival correspondence and never-before-seen proofs that will give visitors a behind-the-scenes insight into the process of creating such unforgettable royal portraits.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/style/unseen-photos-royal-family-gbr-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_04_19_style_wash-day-photos-black-hair-tomesha-faxio", "text": "\u201cI was having wash day with my kids, and I was looking at their hair,\u201d the photographer Tomesha Faxio, a mother of two daughters, explained to CNN in a video call of her new monograph. \u201cI was just sitting in that moment, and it just dawned on me. Like, oh, wait a minute \u2014 this is it. I knew I wanted to showcase our hair in its natural state. I wanted to show the inherent beauty of Black natural hair.\u201d For Black women and children, wash day is equal parts essential maintenance and self-renewal. In my natural-haired family, our weekly or bi-weekly wash day starts with the gathering of the first set of tools; a wide-toothed comb, two body towels \u2014 one that can stand to get wet during the wash, another to wrap hair in afterwards \u2014 as well as shampoo, conditioner and deep conditioner. Once the two washes and conditionings have been completed in the kitchen sink, we head to the playroom, where we finger detangle with a product. Depending on if they\u2019re getting braids or not, my husband or I will blow dry our child\u2019s hair on low heat or let it air dry. (We don\u2019t typically do both of our kids\u2019 hair on the same day.) The process takes maybe three hours, but as a whole hinges on the styling that comes after the wash. This can also take hours, making it feel like every bit of a day. In the series of portraits that make up \u201cWash Day,\u201d Faxio sat with 26 families and took photos as they went through their distinct routines. Though each family had their own methods \u2014 and hair stories, which are shared in texts accompanying Faxio\u2019s photos \u2014 the cyclical nature of washings and styling has made the\u00a0day something that is universally understood, and appreciated, across Black communities. In her approach, Faxio took a pointed interest in hair as it was, versus how it was to become. \u201cI think that there\u2019s been beautiful work done on our hair portraiture and work that\u2019s been done with the hair styled in all these beautiful, intricate ways,\u201d she explained. \u201cBut I hadn\u2019t, at that time, seen a ton of work where the hair was just as is, and that\u2019s what I wanted to capture.\u201d The natural hair movement, with its first wave coming during the Black Is Beautiful era of the 1970s and the second during the digital revolution, has done their part in easing tensions around kinky, unprocessed hair, but old habits die hard. We talk often, after all, about the obsession with hair being \u201cdone\u201d and the intra-communal shame that sometimes comes with natural hair. Even as the Crown Act, a bill meant to stop hair-based discrimination, reverberates country-wide, the predisposition with how Black hair will be perceived \u2018on the job\u2019 \u2014 shorthand for by White observers \u2014 has fed into racist viewpoints and judgments on the acceptability of certain hairstyles. Faxio is hoping her book can further help foster conversations and encourage people to love their hair as it is. \u201cSo many of us have learned to accept ourselves more fully, and, in turn, are able to teach our children to do the same. We are now more informed about why we grew up thinking our hair was ugly\u2026 we can see that that these views are steeped in racism,\u201d she writes in the introduction to \u201cWash Day.\u201d \u201cWhile our children will likely continue to contend with non-inclusive beauty standards, we are putting them in a better position to understand and eradicate them.\u201d Speaking with Faxio, and engaging with her photobook, reminds me of my own childhood wash days. I had a head full of black, thick hair. Keeping me calm during washings was a task; I was afraid of water and recoiled at the idea of each session, let alone the actual practice. One weekend \u2014 my wash days were always on weekends \u2014 my mother needed support. She trotted upstairs to a cousin\u2019s apartment, hoping the elders there would help soothe my fears and step in so she wouldn\u2019t have to do it alone. (She was tired of doing things alone.) There, Mom walked me to the sink, turned the warm water on and started lathering. My aunt and grandmother took turns. I nearly soaked a towel while trying to keep the water from touching my face, but through the fear, I felt cared for. \u201cCalm down. Brooklyn, what if you turn around so your head is facing upward? Right, like that.\u201d  Twenty-five years later, I have a daughter of my own. For us too,\u00a0wash day is a high energy sport \u2014 and it\u2019s also a bonding exercise that neither of us will forget. Therein lies the beauty of the experience. \u201cI learned so much from these moms,\u201d Faxio said. \u201cThe greatest thing for me is a renewed love for wash day and renewed sense of value in the process.\u201d Before she set out to write \u201cWash Day,\u201d she\u2019d try to push back her daughters\u2019 washes because she knew that when it was all said and done, her arms would be sore and she\u2019d want to just melt in bed. Now, though, she welcomes the experience. \u201cIt\u2019s work. But spending time with these moms and thinking about how we are able to pass on love of our hair \u2014 an inheritance of pride and joy in our hair, to our kids,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt just renewed my love for the process.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/19/style/wash-day-photos-black-hair-tomesha-faxio/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}

Lear paid what was a record-breaking price for a Hockney work when he acquired the painting in 1978, according to the auction house, but nowadays the artist\u2019s most valuable pieces sell for tens of millions rather than tens of thousands. The painting, created in 1967, is acrylic on canvas and features a number of sprinklers spraying a green lawn, with a gray building and a fence in the background. It is the top lot in a collection which also features Ed Ruscha\u2019s painting \u201cTruth,\u201d as well as works by Willem de Kooning, Robert Rauschenberg and Ellsworth Kelly.

The girls decided to step down and give (up) their dream of a lifetime \u2014 a crown, a national title. Why would two girls decide to give that up?\u201d It is the first time the mothers have spoken publicly about the ordeal, which roiled the pageant world last week. It marked the first time a titleholder in Miss USA or Miss Teen USA had resigned, and both happened in quick succession. On Instagram, UmaSofia Srivastava said her values \u201cno longer aligned\u201d with those of the organization, while Noelia Voigt cited her mental health, though her long, cryptic statement seemed to spell out \u201cI am silenced\u201d in the first 11 sentences. Speaking on Good Morning America, Jackeline declined to answer whether the supposed secret message was intentional. But responding to whether she feels as if her daughter was silenced, she said \u201cShe is, and she would be the rest of her life if this NDA is not (lifted).\u201d Voigt\u2019s resignation letter to Miss USA, obtained and published by CNN on Saturday, revealed a range of allegations against Miss USA CEO Laylah Rose, including a \u201ctoxic work environment\u201d rife with \u201cbullying.\u201d According to the letter, Rose is \u201cactively building a culture of fear and control, the antithesis of women\u2019s empowerment, that is\u2026unsafe for future titleholders and employees,\u201d Voigt wrote. Among the issues, Voigt claimed that Rose failed to provide her with appropriate travel accommodations or an \u201ceffective handler,\u201d leading to an incident where she was left alone in a car with a stranger at a parade in Sarasota, Florida, where an unnamed man sexually harassed her, she wrote. Her mother, who was with her in Sarasota, saw her just after the alleged incident occurred, she said in the interview. \u201cI saw Noelia so stressed out, and I said, \u2018What happened?\u2019 and she said, \u2018Mom, get in the car,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cHe told Noelia, \u2018Are you into old men with money?\u2019 and made Noelia very, very uncomfortable.\u201d Rose did not apologize, according to Jackeline. In her resignation letter, Voigt said that Rose told her that the organization \u201ccannot prevent people saying things to you at public appearances\u201d and that it is \u201cunfortunately, part of the role.\u201d Barbara Srivastava said that during their reigning year, the titleholders were \u201cill-treated, abused, bullied and cornered.\u201d Jackeline called for the Miss Universe Organization, which owns Miss USA, to \u201cspeak to us or apologize.\u201d The parent organization, owned by JKN Global Group, has been silent over the past week. The Miss USA and Miss Universe Organization did not immediately return a request for comment, and did not respond to CNN\u2019s earlier requests for comments on Friday.

The timepiece sold for ten times its expected auction price of between \u00a3100,000 and \u00a3150,000. Its high selling point has set a \u201cnew world record for Titanic memorabilia,\u201d Andrew Aldridge, the managing director of auction house Henry Aldridge and Son, told CNN on Sunday. Astor was one of around 1,500 people who died when the Titanic sank on April 15, 1912 after hitting an iceberg. His pregnant wife, Madeleine, survived. The watch was among a number of notable items on offer at Henry Aldridge and Son in Wiltshire, England, on Saturday, including the valise that held the violin famously played by the band leader as the ship sank, and a pocketbook that documents the Titanic\u2019s scheduled voyages. The valise was sold for \u00a3360,000, while the violin itself was sold for \u00a31.1 million (nearly $1.7 million at the time) via the same auction house in 2013. It was, until Astor\u2019s pocket watch claimed the title, the highest-selling item from the Titanic. \u201cThese prices for these unique pieces of history reflect not only their importance but also the ongoing interest into the Titanic story and the memory of her passengers and crew,\u201d Aldridge told CNN. The watch was among the personal effects found with Astor\u2019s body after the Titanic sank, according to the auction house. He also had gold cufflinks, a diamond ring, money and a pocketbook on him, among other items. After the recovery of Astor\u2019s body, those possessions were sent to his son, Vincent Astor, who completely restored the watch so that it worked. In 1935, Vincent gave the watch as a christening gift to the infant son of William Dobbyn IV, John Jacob Astor\u2019s executive secretary, according to the auction house.

{"id": "2024_04_04_style_taipei-101-earthquake-design-intl-hnk", "text": "The deadly 7.4 magnitude earthquake that hit Taiwan on Wednesday and left at least 9 people dead, also damaged 770 buildings, according to the latest estimates from the island\u2019s National Fire Agency (NFA). In the capital Taipei, just 80 miles away from the epicenter, buildings also shook violently during what was Taiwan\u2019s strongest earthquake in 25 years. But in a triumph of modern engineering, the soaring Taipei 101, once the world\u2019s tallest skyscraper, emerged from the island\u2019s latest seismic event undamaged. Footage from the quake appears to show the 1,667-foot-tall tower slightly swaying, its structural flexibility helping to counter the powerful motion of the quake. This movement perfectly demonstrated how the skyscraper\u2019s single most important defense against earthquakes is the very material it is constructed from: reinforced concrete. Combining concrete\u2019s compressive strength with steel\u2019s tensile strength, the material makes the building flexible enough to sway, yet rigid enough to resist high winds and the typhoons that frequently hit Taiwan. (The principle that buildings can endure seismic forces by moving with them, rather than against them, has underpinned traditional architecture in earthquake-prone East Asian countries for centuries, from Japanese pagodas to Chinese palaces.) High within the tower,\u00a0however, another technological innovation helps protect the 101-story skyscraper \u2014 a huge orb-like device known as a tuned mass damper. Giant counterweight Suspended from 92 thick cables between the 87th and 92nd floors, the golden steel sphere can move about 5 feet in any direction. As a result, it acts like a pendulum that counteracts (or \u201cdampens\u201d) swaying motions. \u201cIt\u2019s essentially a very large counterweight,\u201d explained Stefan Al, author of \u201cSupertall: How the World\u2019s Tallest Buildings Are Reshaping Our Cities and Our Lives,\u201d in a phone interview. \u201cIn the case of Taipei 101, it\u2019s 660 tons. That seems really heavy, but if you compare it to the overall weight of the building, it\u2019s just a fraction. \u201cWhen a building starts to shake, (the tuned mass damper) will move in the opposite direction. In the case of Taipei 101, it\u2019s suspended\u2026 so it will lag behind as the tower sways and will absorb the kinetic energy by moving in the opposite direction,\u201d Al said, explaining that hydraulic cylinders between the ball and the building convert this energy into heat, which is then dispersed. Tuned mass dampers are used in skyscrapers around the world, including the \u201csuper-skinny\u201d Steinway Tower in New York and Dubai\u2019s sail-shaped Burj al-Arab, which has 11 of them. The device crucially protects against the violent motion caused by \u201charmonic vibration,\u201d which can cause structural failure during an earthquake, Al said. \u201c(That\u2019s) when buildings start to vibrate at their own resonance,\u201d he said, comparing the phenomenon to a tuning fork. \u201cThis can lead to a collapse, (as the building) will start shaking faster and faster and faster.\u201d Tuned mass dampers, which are also known as harmonic absorbers, are \u201ctuned\u201d to resonate at the same frequency as the building \u2014 but with wavelengths starting earlier or later, helping to dissipate the potentially catastrophic energy. The stability they provide can also reduce the uncomfortable \u2014 or even nauseating \u2014 effect swaying can have on a building\u2019s occupants in high winds. Structural support Designed by Taiwanese firm C.Y. Lee & Partners, Taipei 101 was the world\u2019s tallest building from 2004 until 2007, when it was surpassed by the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. An observation deck overlooking its groundbreaking tuned mass damper is now a popular visitor attraction, especially when it moves during strong winds. The giant sphere is not, however, the only design feature helping stabilize the tower, which stands close to a major fault line. For one, the skyscraper sits on exceptionally deep foundations \u2014 namely 380 reinforced concrete and steel piles drilled down into the bedrock below. Above them, the building\u2019s core is connected to a series of \u201cmega-columns,\u201d located around its perimeter, via enormous steel outrigger trusses. The high-rise complies with strict anti-seismic building codes that are as stringent as one might expect on an island located along the \u201cPacific Ring of Fire,\u201d which runs around the edge of the Pacific Ocean and causes massive seismic and volcanic activity from Indonesia to Chile. But while the design also underwent extensive digital modeling and \u201cshake table\u201d testing (in which scale models are tested on a device that replicates the movement of an earthquake), how a building like Taipei 101 would react to a stronger or closer seismic event remains, to an extent, theoretical. \u201cEven though we have computer simulations, there\u2019s still something about the physical that that we cannot really get from digital simulations,\u201d said Al, adding: \u201cDespite our technological advances, we are still testing (designs) in wind tunnels and shaker tables.\u201d This article has been updated to reflect the latest estimates on the number of buildings damaged.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/04/style/taipei-101-earthquake-design-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_style_la-chimera-alice-rohrwacher-isabella-rossellini-interview", "text": "In Alice Rohrwacher\u2019s latest movie, the gently hypnotic \u201cLa Chimera,\u201d a rakish Josh O\u2019Connor navigates the Italian countryside with a dowsing rod in hand, searching for ancient treasure. O\u2019Connor\u2019s character, Arthur, is one of the whispered about \u201ctombaroli\u201d \u2013 grave robbers \u2013 who in the 1980s scoured the hills of what was once Etruria, a civilization from the 7th to the 3rd Century BC. There\u2019s little glory to the pursuit; there\u2019s not even much money to be made grubbing along the bottom of a top-heavy black market in artifacts. But it seems it\u2019s all he\u2019s good for. In other aspects of his life Arthur cuts a shabby, aimless figure. However, with this rod comes purpose and direction, each step bringing him closer to his quarry. Is it an unseen power moving the stick, or blind chance? The outcome is the same, but for Rohrwacher the more mysterious answer is the one that enchants her. In an interview with CNN, when asked why she chose O\u2019Connor for the part, the Italian director said he was \u201cbrought to me by destiny.\u201d In fact, she also has a funny story involving the actor and Rohrwacher\u2019s parents (more of which later), but for a director whose work swirls with fable-like magic, the comment is on brand. Rohrwacher was born in Tuscany and still lives in the same region where the tombaroli have long plied their illicit trade. She studied ancient literature, Greek and Latin at college, and her fourth feature was a chance to marry filmmaking with \u201ca passion that I\u2019ve always had.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a deep connection between archaeology and cinema \u2014 or at least in my way of making cinema, and my desire to be an archaeologist to some extent,\u201d Rohrwacher said. \u201cI feel that sometimes mankind, as far as White men go, behave as if they were the only thing that exists, without a past and without a future,\u201d she explained. \u201cMy job is very close to what an archaeologist does: giving meaning to things that happened in the past.\u201d In the 1980s grave robbing and antique trafficking was rife. As with her previous films, \u201cHeavenly Body,\u201d \u201cThe Wonders\u201d and \u201cHappy As Lazzaro,\u201d Rohrwacher combined local non-actors and established talent to form her merry band of tombaroli, who have little respect for the past, desecrating tombs and passing along their finds to a mysterious broker. We meet O\u2019Connor\u2019s Arthur as he returns from a prison stretch for doing just this. Though he has the gift of finding tombs, Arthur is conflicted about the business. He\u2019s in debt so he has no choice but to continue, but he\u2019s also drawn to these places because of their spiritual aura. For this strange foreigner is mourning the death of a lover; an Orpheus in search of his Eurydice among the realm of the dead. Isabella Rossellini plays the late woman\u2019s mother Flora, who has a soft spot for Arthur, who might be the last link to her daughter. \u201cI asked Alice, \u2018Is this film about death?\u2019\u201d recalled Rossellini, in an interview from her home in New York State. \u201cShe said to me, \u2018It\u2019s not about death, it\u2019s about the beyond.\u2019 And there is a difference. The beyond is a presence that we might still feel.\u201d One senses Rossellini believes this deeply. The actress, model and daughter of director Roberto Rossellini and actress Ingrid Bergman was something of a casting coup for Rohrwacher \u2013 the biggest name yet to feature in one of her films. O\u2019Connor, the ascending star of \u201cThe Crown\u201d and \u201cChallengers,\u201d had to work a little harder to find his way to the project. The British actor had watched 2018\u2019s \u201cHappy as Lazzaro\u201d and decided to write her a letter. \u201cBut he couldn\u2019t find my address,\u201d she said. \u201cSo he sent a number of letters to all kinds of random addresses and one of them reached my parents\u2019 house.\u201d \u201cI had imagined this film with a much older protagonist,\u201d the writer-director shared, but the letter was \u201cbeautiful.\u201d The two met and she decided the 33-year-old \u201chad such an old soul. I realized that he could tell the story of this character, who\u2019s a little scruffy, but a romantic hero, and also somewhat ridiculous.\u201d Arthur\u2019s crumpled linen suit and puppylike demeanor is the acceptable face of and Virgil-like guide into a murky world where the sacred is despoiled, and discovery and loss go hand in hand. In one scene, the tombaroli open an ornate, untouched tomb. The frescoes, vivid for thousands of years, fade before our eyes; their majesty obliterated by a waft of outside air. Even before one of the robbers delivers a horrifying coup de grace to a statue, Rohrwacher condemns them for their intrusion. In real life, the tombaroli operated quite brazenly for much of the 20th Century, even giving interviews to press. The turn of the century saw new laws restricting the illegal movement of Italian antiquities internationally, and in recent years substantial hauls of Etruscan artifacts have been returned. Today Italy has a robust taskforce for protecting and retrieving stolen cultural heritage at home and abroad, including the \u201cBlue Helmets for Culture,\u201d a collaboration between the Carabinieri and UNESCO. But there\u2019s a lot of damage to undo. Countless objects have passed from robbers to middlemen to international private collectors without ever receiving academic scrutiny. \u201cThe Etruscans were a very mysterious civilization,\u201d said Rossellini. \u201cMaybe there was a matriarchy \u2026 We don\u2019t know, because we never deciphered their writing.\u201d With each act of vandalism, such mysteries become harder to solve. Rohrwacher urges the audience to learn more, including a reading list in her film\u2019s end credits (\u201cone movie, interesting though it might be, is limiting,\u201d she said). Nevertheless, there\u2019s a paradox to Rohrwacher\u2019s work. She despairs that the past was put up for sale, at the cost of us better understanding it. Yet an air of mystery is integral to the story she is telling. To approach \u201cLa Chimera\u201d with dense history and sharp facts threatens to tear at its ethereal qualities \u2014 a hallmark of Rohrwacher\u2019s filmmaking. Broadly speaking, her signature style contains a subtle marriage of past and present \u2013 one that didn\u2019t go unnoticed by Rossellini. \u201cI see my father\u2019s influence, or (Federico) Fellini or (Pier Paolo) Pasolini,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me it was a moving moment to work with a young auteur who knew so much about cinema and was so moved by my father\u2019s work.\u201d \u201cHer father was such a maestro for me,\u201d said Rohrwacher of the director behind \u201cPaisan\u201d (1946) and \u201cRome, Open City\u201d (1945), on whose neorealist shoulders she stands, while offering a dose of magic and playfulness the late Italian master did not. \u201cI am fully aware of the importance of that heritage,\u201d she added. \u201cMy memory, my gaze \u2014 my outlook \u2014 was shaped not just by my real experiences, but also by the outlook or gaze that other filmmakers have provided me about reality. It\u2019s as if they trained my eye muscles and they\u2019ve transformed my experience of the world.\u201d \u201cAlice talks about the presence in Italy of this past that never really dies. There is always the pressure of this history,\u201d said Rossellini. \u201cYou live your present and your future, but the past, it shapes you.\u201d However, the past is a slippery thing, as Arthur\u2019s journey so vividly portrays. We stand atop its many layers, but sometimes we find ourselves buried by it. Even if, like \u201cLa Chimera\u2019s\u201d tombaroli, we fail to see its true value, it\u2019s always there. \u201cThe past is not dead,\u201d argued Rossellini. Through Rohrwacher\u2019s eyes, it\u2019s not even past. \u201cLa Chimera\u201d is released in UK cinemas on May 10 and is available to stream in the US.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/style/la-chimera-alice-rohrwacher-isabella-rossellini-interview/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "style_mmakgabo-helen-sebidi-lost-artworks-the-walking-house-south-africa-sweden-spc", "text": "It was a phone call that changed everything. \u201cWe have some good news.\u201d Mmakgabo Helen Sebidi had been waiting to hear those words for more than 30 years. It was May 2023, and the celebrated South African artist, by then 80 years old, could barely believe it. \u201cYour works in Sweden have been found.\u201d Sebidi let out a scream. \u201cMy babies, my babies,\u201d she said into the phone. She was referring to her artworks. Mysteriously lost in 1991, they were coming home at last. Origins of an artist Sebidi was born in 1943 near Hammanskraal, South Africa, north of Pretoria. Her mother had moved to Johannesburg to work as a domestic worker, leaving her daughter in the care of Sebidi\u2019s grandmother, whose traditional painting style would become a major influence on her future. \u201cShe taught me how to do it,\u201d Sebidi recently told CNN, adding she would sometimes surprise her grandmother with a piece she\u2019d done on her own. Sebidi left school after grade eight to take a job as a domestic worker while also learning dressmaking. Any money she made, she sent home to support her grandmother. It was not until 1970, in her late twenties, that Sebidi would take her first official art classes, learning painting and sculpting. Her instructor was John Koenakeefe Mohl, one of South Africa\u2019s pioneering Black professional artists and teachers. Under the umbrella of the Johannesburg Art Foundation, an organization aimed at supporting\u00a0 practicing artists who were not able to go to university, Sebidi would display her works under a tree, once a month, together with other artists in what was called \u201cArt in the park.\u201d \u201cPeople would go and look at mainly terrible stuff but very, very occasionally \u2013 almost never \u2013 an extraordinary artist would emerge,\u201d said Mark Read, chairman of the Everard Read Group of Galleries, which now represents Sebidi. \u201cHelen is the grand luminary figure who emerged from the Johannesburg Art Foundation.\u201d Her talent was evident from the beginning, Read recalled. \u201cThere was never any guiding needed with Helen Sebidi,\u201d he added. \u201cThe opposite was always the case. She now and then thought that we needed guiding, which is probably entirely correct.\u201d Against the backdrop of apartheid policies in South Africa throughout the 1970s, Sebidi continued to refine her craft and find her voice, often depicting traditional imagery from a time before colonialism would grip the continent. An invitation in 1985 to showcase her work at the Federated Union of Black Artists (FUBA) sparked widespread attention for her work. It was her first solo exhibition and a first for a Black female artist. It was a moment that would change the trajectory of her career. Four years later, Sebidi received a Fulbright Scholarship to travel to the US and continue her art at the prestigious Millary Colony for the Arts in New York state. \u201cMy child became my work\u201d Yet it was an opportunity in Sweden in 1991 that would result in a most unexpected turn of events. As part of a program designed to introduce the world to rising South African artists \u2013 who would in turn have an opportunity to meet and establish contacts with Swedish artists \u2013 Sebidi accepted an invitation to the Swedish city of Nyk\u00f6ping to exhibit a series of paintings. Her trip would involve a one month residency where she would share South African knowledge with students at Nyk\u00f6ping Folk High School \u2013 just as South Africa was on the brink of democracy. \u201cIt was a very vibrant time for the visual arts in South Africa,\u201d said Kim Berman, a professor of visual arts at the University of Johannesburg. \u201cPeople were really excited about imaging what a new democracy looked like; corporates and organizations wanted to buy young artists\u2019 work, put it on their wall, and take down the kind of impressionist European posters.\u201d Two years before her Nyk\u00f6ping trip, Sebidi was involved in a serious car accident where she almost lost her life. During the incident, she says she received instruction in the form of a vision with a woman\u2019s voice to paint the body of work that would become the collection she\u2019d exhibit in Sweden. \u201cI was dead in that car accident,\u201d Sebidi recalled. \u201cThe women, the voices came from deep green, very deep green and the road I wanted to go to my mother, was black, black, black, and the other side was this strong, beautiful forest.\u201d Sebedi worked tirelessly to produce work that would tell the story of her lived experience, and that of Black South Africans. Compelled by her grandmother\u2019s voice and that of her ancestors, she called the collection \u201cNtlo E Etsamayang (The Walking House).\u201d  Although Sebidi never had children of her own, her art filled her life. \u201cMy child became my work,\u201d she said. A devastating mystery unfolds The paintings were all made over the course of about a year, where she couldn\u2019t sleep. Sebidi was haunted by visions and continued to work, her ancestors speaking to her saying, \u201cyour work is not done, get back to your work,\u201d said Gabriel Baard, the curator of Sebidi\u2019s most recent exhibition in Johannesburg. \u201cBefore this kind of period between 1990 and 1991, (Sebidi) was working quite monochromatically. She worked in etchings and liner cuts, occasionally silk screens,\u201d he added. Contrary to her usual technique, these new paintings exposed \u201ca reflection on her emotional state at the time. They are frantic, and fast and you can see the hand movement throughout every single drawing; an expression and an outlet to deal with her trauma,\u201d Baard described. With her artworks unframed and wrapped in rolls, Sebidi traveled to Sweden in 1991. As another artist was currently exhibiting, the curator at the school behind the project\u00a0assured her to leave them in his care, and he\u2019d call when it was her turn. That call never came. After a year went by without any communication, Sebidi requested her work be returned. But she was told that it had gone missing \u2013 believed to have been stolen. Over the years, she exchanged numerous letters with the organizers, but it was all in vain. She says the pain of losing her \u201cchildren\u201d pushed her to \u201cwork harder and harder.\u201d She became a figurehead representing Black women as a mentor in South African arts. \u201cThere were textbooks written about her \u2013 she was included in the curricula for many of the schools,\u201d Berman said. Her other works were exhibited all over the world, including the Smithsonian in the US. In 2004, she was awarded the Order of Ikhamanga by former South African President Thabo Mbeki \u2013 among the country\u2019s highest honors, given to those considered \u201ca national treasure.\u201d But all the attention and accolades in the world still could not bring her missing paintings back home. The homecoming In May 2023, while cleaning out a cupboard in the attic of Nyk\u00f6ping Folk High School in Sweden, caretaker Jesper Osterberg discovered a large paper roll with Sebidi\u2019s name, and a marker that indicated it had traveled from Johannesburg to Stockholm, on Swiss Air Freight. It was the majority of Sebidi\u2019s missing \u201cNtlo E Etsamayang (The Walking House)\u201d collection, 32 years after it was lost. Baard traveled to the south of Sweden to collect the 28 found pieces and deliver them back to Sebidi. His first encounter with them was very emotional, he said, seeing this body of work that had been missing for over three decades. \u201cI saw the faces actually at the top of the triptych kind of peering out to me,\u201d Baard described. \u201cIt was transcendental and spiritual as I watched the work come to life.\u201d With great excitement and anticipation, Sebidi rallied her whole community, family and friends to welcome the pieces back home. As she unrolled her work for the first time in 32 years, onlookers gasped in amazement. \u201cThe work was truly timeless,\u201d said Read. \u201cLooking at it, one couldn\u2019t say with any degree of surety what era it was from; inevitably that will mean that in the future it\u2019ll also be just as fresh.\u201d A new generation On April 6, \u201cNtlo E Etsamayang (The Walking House)\u201d went on display to the public for the first time at the University of Johannesburg Art Gallery, in partnership with Everard Read Gallery and the Swedish Embassy in Pretoria. The paintings illustrate tumultuous groups of figures sometimes tumbling upon each other like a continuous dance. The colors feature shades of orange and deep reds, with thick paint on handmade paper that was sometimes torn and stuck on top of each other, adding texture and character. Though there are still four small oil paintings missing, Sebidi is content with having her \u201cchildren\u201d back home and accessible for a new generation. She says she believes that her work \u201cwas hidden by those ancestors wanting the current generation to prepare ourself for the bigger voice, bigger energy.\u201d Reflective of the \u201cNtlo E Etsamayang (The Walking House)\u201d shaped by her grandmother, Sebidi hopes her work will influence the university to teach its students about indigenous knowledge. \u201cAfrican knowledge systems need to be created and have to be launched and have to be in free places,\u201d Sebidi said. \u201cWe need those freedoms.\u201d Mmakgabo Helen Sebidi\u2019s exhibition is on display at the University of Johannesburg Art Gallery until May 17, 2024.", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/mmakgabo-helen-sebidi-lost-artworks-the-walking-house-south-africa-sweden-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_03_19_style_big-biba-london-1960s-store-history", "text": "\u201cMy God, it\u2019s dull,\u201d said interior designer Steven Thomas of the British retail landscape in 2024. As the creative force behind the look of the wildly popular 1970s London fashion store Big Biba, Thomas knows a thing or two about engineering excitement. Big Biba \u2014 a daring, 20,000 square foot destination by fashion illustrator Barbara Hulanicki and her former marketing executive husband, Stephen Fitz-Simon \u2014 was conceived with a level of detail usually reserved for high-end concept stores.\u00a0Opened in September 1973,\u00a0it was the\u00a0fourth and final outpost of the-then iconic brand.\u00a0The\u00a0seven-floor Art Deco emporium on London\u2019s fashionable Kensington High Street featured\u00a0a soup stand inspired by Andy Warhol, a roof garden featuring real flamingos and penguins, and a much-lauded celebrity hotspot the \u201cRainbow Room\u201d. \u201cBecause the Rainbow Room looked the way it did, it didn\u2019t take long for the glitterati to latch on; it was very much a place to be seen dining,\u201d recalled Thomas in an interview with CNN. Originally designed by architect Marcel Hennequet in 1933 and named after its multi-colored ceiling (the dining room was otherwise all white tablecloths and fake plants), it \u201cbecame a venue of choice,\u201d he suggested. \u201cDavid Bowie, Mick Jagger, Bryan Ferry all dropped in.\u201d \u201cFitz employed the son of a friend who had an extraordinary knack of picking people up, like Ian Dury and the Blockheads,\u201d continued Thomas, recalling the unofficial booker. \u201cHe got the New York Dolls to play when they came over, another coup. They did a vandalizing tour of the first floor, shoplifting all the women\u2019s clothes.\u201d These stories and more are all explored in \u201cWelcome to Big Biba,\u201d Thomas\u2019s gold-fronted monograph of the venture republished this month by ACC Art Books to celebrate the brand\u2019s 60th anniversary. \u201cThis book is a testament to creative freedom,\u201d writes the now 87-year-old Hulanicki in the foreword, reflecting on her legacy. \u201cYou can do it all as long as you learn to wear a suit. Of course, your secret will be that the suit is lined in gold lam\u00e9.\u201d Making fashion democratic The Biba story began in May 1964 when Hulanicki and Fitz-Simon began running \u201cBiba\u2019s Postal Boutique,\u201d a mail-order store selling limited runs of stock. Singer Annie Lennox described the venture as having led \u201cthe way for those of us living in provincial places where we felt we were dying of drabness.\u201d Inspired by decadent styles from bygone times \u2014 albeit with drastically shortened hemlines \u2014 in earthy or muted colors such as olive, rust and \u201cbruised purple,\u201d Biba\u2019s wares certainly struck a chord with young female shoppers, and the brand rode the wave of what Thomas described as \u201cthe first burst of teenage energy and finance availability.\u201d \u201cBiba made fashion democratic,\u201d explained Martin Pel, author of \u201cThe Biba Years 1963-1975\u201d and curator of a new exhibition at London\u2019s Fashion & Textile Museum, in an email. \u201cThis expression is often overused of designers in the 1960s, particularly Mary Quant. Quant\u2019s clothes whilst youthful, were expensive. Biba was inexpensive, well designed, good quality, and up-to-the-minute.\u201d By September 1964, Hulanicki and Fitz-Simon had opened their first brick and mortar store in a former drugstore, twice moving the business into bigger premises throughout the 60s. In 1966 the brand\u2019s second shop on Kensington Church Street \u2014 where Vogue editor Anna Wintour famously did a stint as a Saturday girl \u2014 was described by Vanity Fair magazine as \u201cthe most exotic shop in London.\u201d and in the early 1970s, a boutique launched in New York\u2019s Bergdorf Goodman department store. \u201cAn act of bravery\u201d Interior designer Thomas had already designed Hulanicki and Fitz-Simon\u2019s home and the third Biba store in 1968 before being approached about the landmark seven-level store. \u201cFitz offered me two floors (of Big Biba) but I wanted it all,\u201d he recalled of his initial involvement. \u201cA moment of complete lunacy, considering Tim (Whitmore, his creative partner) and I were ex-painting students working out of my bedroom. It was an extraordinary act of bravery on their part, giving us the contract, it wouldn\u2019t happen today.\u201d Stocking Big Biba\u2019s seven floors was equal parts intimidating and invigorating said Thomas, explaining that he and Whitmore worked closely with Hulanicki throughout. \u201cBiba was always a reflection of Barbara\u2019s life,\u201d he noted, \u201cso because Barbara had a kid, of course we had a kid\u2019s floor,\u201d with d\u00e9cor inspired by Disney World, a carousel ride and miniature cottage kids caf\u00e9 with toadstool seating. On Saturdays, an actor would visit and read stories and a cr\u00e8che \u2014 a revolutionary concept in fashion retail now, let alone 50 years ago \u2014 allowed parents freedom to explore the other floors. A maternity section and a space for 11-13 year old\u2019s were similarly modern for the time, likewise the introduction of communal changing rooms \u2014 although true to the spirit of the times, many clients reportedly changed in the middle of the store itself. Elsewhere menswear took over the third floor, complete with a \u201cmistress\u201d section for purchasing more sensual items with discretion. Biba-branded household items were upstairs. While each floor took on its own theme (maternity for example was fitted with comedic outsized furniture, inspired by Ken Russell\u2019s 1971 musical comedy \u201cThe Boyfriend\u201d), much of the store was furnished in Biba\u2019s distinctive black and gold colorway, with mirrored fixtures, ostrich feathers and leopard print features. While Wintour\u2019s shopgirl life was short-lived, Big Biba\u2019s staff were a vital component of the experience remembered Thomas. \u201cThey loved working there, it was their club,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if a (customer) bought a Biba poster and stuck it on her wall, she felt part of the club. It was the theater of retail really.\u201d It was an unmitigated success. When the store opened its legendary roof gardens in 1974, they were ushered in by a party described in the British press as \u201clike walking into a film set of rather jolly moral depravity.\u201d Shoppers from all over the country, and even internationally, convened at the store to buy into the zeitgeist. According to Hulanicki, during its two-year run, Big Biba was the number two tourist attraction in the British capital after the Tower of London, with Buckingham Palace being number three. But Biba\u2019s success was short-lived. In 1969, the independent company sold a majority of its shares to another British fashion retailer Dorothy Perkins which, in August 1973 (a month before Big Biba opened), was then bought by a property development company called British Land. The high cost of keeping the store open and the faltering British economy of the mid-70s meant the new owners closed the store\u2019s third and fourth floors in March 1975, and the rest of the store followed that September against the backdrop of a nationwide property slump. Six decades on however, Biba\u2019s legacy outlasts its footprint on the high street. Its low-cost yet well-made clothing is still coveted today, with heirloom designs sometimes retailing for hundreds of dollars. As Pel noted, \u201ctoday Biba clothes stand as a lesson to both consumers and retailers that inexpensive fashion does not have to be disposable.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/style/big-biba-london-1960s-store-history/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_style_platon-photographer-portraits", "text": "Vladimir Putin, Muammar Gaddafi, Mark Zuckerberg. Presidents and Hollywood stars; political dissidents, abuse survivors and immigrants. One thing unites them all: a slightly scuffed, white wooden box. \u201cMore world leaders have sat on that box than any chair in history,\u201d the photographer Platon, owner of that very box, told CNN in an interview conducted over Zoom. For some world leaders, the scarcity of his set \u2014 sitting on the box in front of a plain black or white sheet of paper \u2014 can be intimidating, stripping them of their usual grandeur. For others it\u2019s liberating, allowing the human to shine through the professional storyteller. For the subjects of Platon\u2019s new book \u201cThe Defenders,\u201d the box became an opportunity. \u201cThere\u2019s a statement that\u2019s quite common in the human rights community,\u201d Platon said. \u201c\u2018Giving a voice to the voiceless\u2019. I have learned through my experiences that it\u2019s not right to say that. They have beautiful, powerful, strong voices; the issue is that those voices have been ignored.\u201d Through his work, he explained his mission is to help amplify people\u2019s stories, tuning into their humanity as though they were \u201can old-fashioned radio\u201d. Unseating power Born in Greece in 1968, Platon Antoniou moved to the UK aged eight and completed his studies in photography at the Royal College of Art, before leaving London for a career in New York. There, he worked on George magazine with John Kennedy Jr. and as a staff photographer at the New Yorker magazine. \u201cThe Defenders\u201d takes a different tack to Platon\u2019s earlier work. As a young photographer, he confessed he was dazzled by the world of politicians and celebrities he was working with, walking the corridors of the Kremlin and Downing Street and \u201chaving a chat about life\u201d in George Clooney\u2019s garden. Turning his lens to the powerless, by contrast, has upturned his ideas of power altogether. \u201cHaving photographed all these world leaders, often the people I meet in the trenches of the human rights movement are proper leaders,\u201d he said. \u201cThey transform their adversity into compassion for others. And that\u2019s something I very rarely see on that level in the political sphere. So I called them \u2014 I call the book \u2014 \u201cThe Defenders,\u201d because it\u2019s a superhero title. These are ordinary people who do extraordinary things, and I do think of them as superheroes. Changing the narrative is very important for me.\u201d Among \u201cThe Defenders\u201d are Burmese and Egyptian dissidents, the imprisoned Russian punk band Pussy Riot, and survivors of sexual violence at Dr. Denis Mukwege\u2019s Panzi Hospital in Congo. One of the girls that Platon photographed there was Esther Faraja. She appeared in an episode of Netflix\u2019s \u201cAbstract: The Art of Design,\u201d profiling Platon, although he said the details of the trauma she suffered were \u201ctoo harsh to put in the film.\u201d \u201cAs I was taking the picture, she wasn\u2019t crying,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI\u2019m a privileged, middle-aged white man, and I\u2019m a mess. I said to her, \u2018how is it that I\u2019m crying, and you\u2019re not crying? And yet, you\u2019re the one that has suffered?\u2019 And she said: \u2018the reason I don\u2019t cry in your picture is because I don\u2019t want to make you feel sad. I don\u2019t want anyone to feel sad when they look at a picture of me. My mommy and daddy brought me into this world to bring joy to the world. And I will keep my promise\u2019.\u201d Platon is as awestruck now as he was standing in front of her. \u201cNow that is a leader,\u201d he said. \u201cI made a promise to her that I will deliver her message of compassion and strength, combined, to as many people as I can.\u201d \u201cThe Defenders\u201d is an attempt to tell dozens of stories like hers, each captured in one 500th of a second. \u201cTime is a very interesting concept; it doesn\u2019t really ever exist,\u201d Platon mused. \u201cYou try to freeze a moment that helps us understand the past and will still be relevant in the future. And yet, it was a moment in the present. And it was such a tiny fragment of a moment that if you blinked, you wouldn\u2019t even have seen it.\u201d Two political giants offer obvious examples of time\u2019s bizarre effect. Vladimir Putin, photographed by Platon for Time\u2019s Person of the Year in 2007, initially liked the image that Platon produced. He appears powerful. In the time since its publication, however, the same image has been taken, edited, and circulated by political dissidents to mock Putin and belittle his power. \u201cI heard in the last two years that anyone who\u2019s caught circulating my picture in connection with human rights issues will go to jail,\u201d Platon said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s the same picture. And Putin likes it.\u201d Bill Clinton, on a December 2000 cover of Esquire courtesy of Platon, has also been changed with age. \u201cAt the time, that picture represented insane levels of charisma,\u201d Platon recalled. \u201cHe was great with people \u2014 everyone says there\u2019s no one more charismatic than Bill Clinton. We look at it through a different lens now, but it\u2019s the same picture. When I get it right, that same picture works for everybody.\u201d It doesn\u2019t work for Hillary Clinton, though. \u201cHillary refuses to sit for me,\u201d Platon noted. \u201cShe\u2019s one of the only politicians who\u2019s ever said no. And that\u2019s interesting. The \u2018no\u2019 now is actually as interesting as the \u2018yes\u2019.\u201d Great responsibility Distilling broad, complicated, emotional human stories into one fleeting moment is a tribulation of all photography, including that of world leaders, but it was particularly difficult when it came to the sensitive topics broached in \u201cThe Defenders\u201d. \u201cMany of (the people photographed) risk their lives and their security telling me these stories,\u201d Platon said. \u201cI cannot be reckless. I cannot be \u2014 I must not be \u2014 a thrill-seeker.\u201d Exerting due diligence and handling sensitive subjects thoughtfully is something that Platon admits is a luxury of time; he is able to spend months on a project, producing the most considered and provoking images he can. Increasingly, however, a lot of the photography flooding social media is taken hastily, captured on phones and shared without so much as a pause for breath. In \u201cThe Defenders,\u201d Platon remembers the Burmese politician Aung San Suu Kyi coming out of house arrest and being bewildered by the sea of smartphones pointed at her. \u201cNow everyone\u2019s a photographer, and everyone\u2019s a filmmaker,\u201d Platon observed. \u201cIn many ways, that\u2019s fantastic. People are holding the powers that be accountable in a new way. The danger is that there\u2019s so much information that we\u2019re constantly distracted. It\u2019s very difficult to get that moment of reflection and pause, and to stand back and think for yourself. As you\u2019re even doing that, your phone is dinging and clicking and beeping \u2014 it\u2019s constant noise.\u201d In standing back, Platon was able to join the dots between the movements he was documenting; they weren\u2019t isolated struggles, he realized, but connected ones. \u201cObviously each geopolitical situation is inherently different, but they are all fighting for very basic human principles,\u201d he said. \u201cI photographed LGBTQ+ defenders in Burma and in Russia. That\u2019s two very, very different countries, with the same cause.\u201d In capturing and amplifying the stories of \u201cThe Defenders,\u201d Platon hopes to inspire and instruct other people, just as he was inspired and instructed. \u201cIt\u2019s really a handbook to the new generation to say: roll up your sleeves, get involved. Society needs a new generation of activists who will think differently. They will have a different path to navigate, but the principles remain timeless and the same. It\u2019s the principles that unite us all. The way we fight, the tools we fight with, the strategies \u2014 we have to change those, because times change. But the principles stay the same.\u201d \u201cThe Defenders\u201d, published by MW Editions, is available now.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/style/platon-photographer-portraits/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_04_19_style_michael-schumacher-watch-collection-auction-intl-scli", "text": "Eight of Formula One legend Michael Schumacher\u2019s luxury and personalized watches are going up for auction \u2013 and they could sell for more than $4.8 million in total. The rare timepieces will be exhibited in New York from May 3 to May 5, the weekend of the Miami Grand Prix, ahead of the auction in Geneva, Switzerland, on May 13, according to auction house Christie\u2019s. Schumacher\u2019s family holds an array of watches collected by the champion driver over the years and, \u201cmore recently, they decided to part ways with specific watches of the collection, where they believed watch collectors would be able to appreciate the true value of the pieces,\u201d Christie\u2019s head of watches Remi Guillemin told CNN Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re really just extremely happy to have these watches and to have been able to collaborate with the family,\u201d he added. The collection will form part of Christie\u2019s traditional rare watches auction, consisting of vintage and modern pieces of high-caliber watchmaking from brands such as Audemars Piguet, F.P. Journe and Rolex. Standout pieces include Schumacher\u2019s platinum F.P. Journe Vagabondage 1, which holds almost half the estimated value of the entire collection, with an expected sale price of up to $2.2 million. Meanwhile, a Rolex stainless steel Paul Newman Daytona watch is expected to sell for up to $440,000 and Schumacher\u2019s Audemars Piguet Royal Oak watch is expected to sell for up to $280,000. The Rolex watch was named after the Daytona International Speedway in Florida, according to Guillemin, who described the timepiece as \u201cone of the most iconic watches that Rolex ever made.\u201d The white gold Royal Oak chronograph was commissioned as a personalized gift for the seven-time F1 World Championship winner from his early mentor and former Ferrari CEO Jean Todt, according to the auction house. Presented to Schumacher at Christmas 2003, its features celebrate the six Championship victories he had achieved by that time, Christie\u2019s said. The 30-minute register dial is surrounded by six stars, and there are depictions of Ferrari\u2019s famous prancing horse emblem and Schumacher\u2019s red racing helmet. \u201cIt\u2019s a unique watch,\u201d said Guillemin. \u201cWhen you see the watch from afar, you just know that it\u2019s something special and that it speaks to Michael Schumacher.\u201d The platinum Vagabondage 1 watch was also a gift from Todt, but for the following Christmas. So, while it has similar features, its striking red dial hosts symbols that represent the seventh Championship Schumacher won for himself and Ferrari. A prototype of the watch was sold in 2003 to benefit the Paris Brain Institute (ICM) Foundation, of which Schumacher and Todt are founding members, according to the auction house. \u201cThese watches (are) for people who are following Formula One, who have followed, like I have, Michael Schumacher when he was racing. It\u2019s just a true piece of memorabilia and history \u2013 and, on top of that, these two watches are important for watchmaking,\u201d Guillemin added. Schumacher sustained a brain injury after suffering severe head trauma during a skiing accident in 2013. He has not appeared in public since, but his wife Corinna said in a 2021 Netflix documentary, \u201cWe live together at home. We do therapy. We do everything we can to make Michael better and to make sure he\u2019s comfortable.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/19/style/michael-schumacher-watch-collection-auction-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_style_mona-lisa-setting-italian-town-claim", "text": "Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s Mona Lisa \u2014 one of the most famous paintings in the world \u2014 is shrouded in mystery; from questions around the figures identity, to her puzzling, enigmatic expression. Now, at least one of the artwork\u2019s secrets has been revealed, according to a geologist based in Italy. Ann Pizzorusso, who is both a geologist and an art historian specializing in Leonardo and the Renaissance era, believes she has deduced the location of the Mona Lisa using her geological expertise. Three decades ago, Pizzorusso visited the town of Lecco on the southeastern shore of Lake Como in Italy \u2014 where she believes the painting is set \u2014\u00a0to retrace Leonardo\u2019s steps, armed with diary entries and drawings from the artist. \u201cIn his notebook he mentions being in Lecco,\u201d she told CNN in a phone interview. \u201cHe was working as an engineer.\u201d According to Pizzorusso, the project Leonardo was working on was canceled, but his geological field sketches remained (one red chalk drawing of a mountain range near Lecco belongs to the Royal Collection at Windsor, London). While Pizzorusso is not the first to have theorized on the location of the Mona Lisa (in 2011, an art historian attributed the painting\u2019s scenery to a small town called Bobbio, while another to Arezzo) she believes she is the first geologist. Previous calculations have concentrated on the arched bridge over the Mona Lisa\u2019s right shoulder. However, Pizzorusso insists more can be gleaned from the unique rock formation in the horizon. \u201cBridges are fungible,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you look in the background, you\u2019ll see pinnacles. It\u2019s a type of erosion that happens in limestone that has fractures in it and breaks off in blocks, almost like a sawtooth pattern\u2026 We can show limestone exists in (Lecco). When you look at the Mona Lisa, there\u2019s a series of mountains in the background that have this sawtooth pattern.\u201d Similarly, the body of water behind Mona Lisa is geologically specific, believed by Pizzorusso to be Lake Como \u2014 a subalpine glacial lake dating back around 10,000 years. \u201cIf you look behind her you have the elongated glacial lakes that have a particular form like fingers,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause when the glacier moved it scoured out certain pieces of land.\u201d Despite her confidence, Pizzorusso kept her inkling quiet for 30 years, telling only other Leonardo scholars in casual conversation. She returned to Lecco this week, still assured that \u201ceverything added up,\u201d and will now present her findings at a geology conference in the town. While the pairing of earth science and art history may seem disparate, Pizzorusso argues the interdisciplinary approach can enrich the viewing experience of Leonardo\u2019s work. \u201cBotticelli, even Michelangelo did terrible backgrounds because they felt the figures were more important,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cIf the background is painted right, it gives you more of an appreciation for nature.\u201d Though Pizzorusso admits she is surprised at the widespread interest. \u201cMaybe (Leonardo) was trying to channel me for the environmental movement or something,\u201d she joked. \u201cIt\u2019s a testament to how much people love this painting.\u201d But the discovery may only lead to more mystery. If the location is Lecco, as Pizzorusso suggests, more questions remain as to why the renowned painter chose that particular spot, for this particular portrait. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who (Mona Lisa) is, some believe she was a rich Tuscan merchant\u2019s wife,\u201d she said, referring to a popular historical theory that proposes the figure was based on Italian noblewoman Lisa Gherardini. \u201cWhy did he put her in this wild, untamed environment? This is not Tuscany. What was he trying to tell us by putting this serene, enigmatic lady in this rugged, alpine environment?\u201d Said Pizzorusso. \u201cI\u2019m really intrigued as to what his message was to us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/style/mona-lisa-setting-italian-town-claim/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_04_19_style_china-luxury-watches", "text": "When the luxury Watches and Wonders fair closed its doors in Geneva earlier this week, it had hosted an estimated 49,000 luxury watch enthusiasts and collectors from around the world, all eager to be inspired by the best new designs and complications. According to a report by the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry (FHS), mainland China and Hong Kong combined spent over 5 billion Swiss francs (5.49 billion) on watches in 2023, meaning luxury consumers in greater China are the biggest clients when it comes to the 26.7 billion franc (29.3 billion) watch exports business. But one region\u2019s visitors stood out among the crowd \u2014 40% of this year\u2019s attendees hailed from Asia according to the event\u2019s CEO Matthieu Humair, with a significant portion coming from China. Watching your wealth It\u2019s not surprising. Despite economic challenges looming large \u2014 including prolonged downturns in both the housing and stock market \u2014 China\u2019s fascination with luxury watches remains undiminished. In fact, luxury watches are seen by many affluent Chinese as a compelling alternative investment avenue during times of financial uncertainty, when diversifying away from \u201ctraditional\u201d investment\ufeffs such as real estate or stocks is seen as prudent. Certainly at this year\u2019s fair, well-dressed, well-accessorized Chinese customers appeared unfazed by economic uncertainties. Mostly invited by brands, these high-spending VIP guests often pay millions for timepieces or jewelry, either at home in China or during overseas travels. Accordingly, Chinese brand ambassadors were also front and center at this year\u2019s fair, with appearances by actors such as Jackson Yee at Jaeger Le-Coultre, Zhu Yilong at Chopard and Wang Yang at IWC. Other personalities including actor and singer Xiao Zhan conducted livestream sessions that\u00a0enthusiasts could tune into. David Sadigh is CEO of Digital Luxury Group, a digital marketing agency in Europe and China whose clients include Patek Philippe and Van Cleef & Arpels. After more than 20 years working in the region, he believes China\u2019s economic slowdown is just a temporary phase. \u201cThe higher-end price point brands are not concerned (by the downturn),\u201d Sadigh told CNN during an interview at the fair in Geneva. \u201cThe situation may be slightly (more) challenging for mid-level luxury brands (whose clients\u2019 disposable incomes are potentially more at the whim of market forces). But I\u2019m confident that in the long run, China will be the biggest market for luxury watches.\u201d Many executives of the 54 watchmaking brands that CNN spoke to at Watches and Wonders echoed this sentiment, expressing confidence in China\u2019s ongoing passion for luxury timepieces and underscoring the resilience of this market segment amid the broader economic headwinds. Sales at Hublot, a prominent luxury watch brand in the LVMH stable, have this year rebounded to pre-pandemic levels, although growth rates have slowed compared to the peak of post-pandemic \u201crevenge spending\u201d (a phenomenon whereby customers rush to spend more than they usually would on something after being deprived of the ability to do so)\u00a0in 2022. Despite commanding price tags sometimes into the millions of yuan, the brand continues to attract discerning consumers, with US and China as its biggest clients. \u201cIt\u2019s understandable that people wait and see how to spend their money when the market is down,\u201d said Hublot CEO Ricardo Guadalupe. \u201cFor the Chinese consumers, once they consume, they will come back, because they appreciate luxury watches from the bottom of their heart.\u201d Indeed, despite being a relatively new market for watchmakers, wealthy Chinese customers are already regarded as discerning clients alongside buyers from more mature markets like Europe and the US, who have long appreciated the artistry, elegance, and craftsmanship in haute horology. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen in Asia \u2014 China in particular \u2014 average consumers are younger, around 35 (and) have an eye for unusual designs,\u201d said Guadalupe. Carson Chan, a timepiece expert whose previous titles include General Manager of Richard Mille Asia, Bonhams\u2019 Head of Watches and Chief Advisor of Fondation de la Haute Horlogerie (FHH), is also a collector. \u201cIn Asia, where collecting large items like cars can be challenging, watches offer a compact alternative for collectors,\u201d Chan told CNN in an email interview from his home in Hong Kong. \u201cThe strong learning culture and understanding of mechanisms in Asia further support a sophisticated market, evidenced by the rise of independent brands across the region,\u201d he added. Raphael Young, who also lives in Hong Kong and works in financial services in the IT industry, has just returned from the fair in Geneva. \u201cAs a watch collector, the five main criteria I look deeply into (are) value, craftsmanship, history, innovation and the people behind the timepieces and the brand,\u201d he told CNN via a phone interview and added; \u201cThere is a lot of learning, researching, meetings and almost scholarly pursuits involved in cultivating my collecting hobby.\u201d Timeless designs A. Lange & S\u00f6hne, a smaller independent watchmaker producing just 5,000 pieces globally, maintains a distinctive niche in the market. The brand\u2019s CEO Wilhelm Schmid also remained unperturbed by China\u2019s economic conditions. \u201cA. Lange\u2019s customers are real collectors; it\u2019s very niche. Though our price is not low, there are groups of clients whose finances are not affected by the market fluctuations, who just appreciate the best timepieces,\u201d he told CNN in an interview at the event. The house\u2019s new Datograph Perpetual Tourbillon Honeygold Lumen, for example, integrates a flyback chronograph, a jumping minute counter, perpetual calendar with outsized date and a tourbillon with a stop-seconds mechanism. Some watchmakers appear to be courting Chinese buyers through unique design flourishes and Chan has observed that smaller case sizes are trending. Eleven years in the making, Vacheron Constantin\u2019s record breaking one-piece-only giant pocket watch\u00a0The Berkley has been designed to celebrate cultural fusion by combining traditional Chinese lunar calendar functions with Western horological complexities \u2014 for example a perpetual calendar, minute repeater, and tourbillon. \u201cThe Berkley features the first Chinese perpetual calendar which, given the particularities of the complex and irregular cycle\u2026 is a feat of horological genius,\u201d said Young. \u201cChina has the longest continuous history of any country in the world (with) 3,500 years of written history, and it is only now we have a mechanical timepiece for the Chinese perpetual calendar. As a Chinese, I would find it useful and would be very interested in having such a complication.\u201d Meanwhile, renowned Swiss watchmaker Roger Dubuis created another novelty in celebration of the new Year of the Dragon, on display in Geneva earlier this week. Limited to eight pieces, it is expected to appeal to Chinese collectors and enthusiasts. Among some of the most popular luxury fashion brands in China \u2014 which also include Dior, Louis Vuitton and Gucci \u2014 Chanel and Hermes have joined the traditional watchmakers at the fair, expanding beyond fashion watches into the universe of high watchmaking. Herm\u00e8s unveiled the Arceau Duc Attel\u00e9 watch, featuring a sapphire dome top and new minute repeater; and Chanel debuted a 55-piece limited edition Mademoiselle J12 Couture watch featuring a dial adorned with the silhouette of Mademoiselle Chanel in a black and white suit, finished with 46 baguette-cut diamonds. Unlike volatile financial markets, watches offer tangible value combined with emotional attachment. Collectors appreciate the craftsmanship, rarity, and heritage associated with luxury timepieces, which can hold or increase in value over time. \u201cIn a world where everything is so connected, there\u2019s nothing more beautiful than a wristwatch powered by mechanical movement. It\u2019s timeless, a piece of art, something to pass down to generations.\u201d explained Humair. \u201cWe\u2019re very excited to see younger generations in Asia, especially China, show a lot of interest in watchmaking.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/19/style/china-luxury-watches/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_style_king-charles-first-portrait-since-coronation-unveiled", "text": " Buckingham Palace revealed the first official portrait of King Charles III since his coronation on Tuesday, and it\u2019s proving to be divisive with its lurid red brushstrokes. The 8.5 by 6.5-foot painting is by British artist Jonathan Yeo, who has painted high-profile subjects throughout his career including former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, actor Nicole Kidman and education activist Malala Yousafzai. Yeo, who began the project while Charles was still Prince of Wales, depicts the monarch wearing the uniform of the Welsh Guards, sword in hand, against a fiery red background that appears to almost swallow him whole, as a butterfly looks like it\u2019s about to land on his shoulder. \u201cMuch like the butterfly I\u2019ve painted hovering over his shoulder, this portrait has evolved as the subject\u2019s role in our public life has transformed,\u201d said Yeo in a statement released by Buckingham Palace. \u201cI do my best to capture the life experiences etched into any individual sitter\u2019s face. In this case, my aim was also to make reference to the traditions of royal portraiture but in a way that reflects a 21st century monarchy and, above all else, to communicate the subject\u2019s deep humanity.\u201d Yeo had four sittings with the King, and also worked from drawings and photographs according to the palace. The work was commissioned to celebrate the 50th\u00a0anniversary of Charles\u2019 membership in The Drapers\u2019 Company, which funds education initiatives among other philanthropic efforts, and will be exhibited to the public from\u00a0May 16 to June 14 at the Philip Mould Gallery in London. It will later hang at Drapers\u2019 Hall from the end of August alongside other royal portraits. The King and Queen are reportedly happy with the portrait \u2014 Yeo\u00a0told\u00a0the BBC Camilla said: \u201cYes you\u2019ve got him,\u201d after seeing the result, while the monarch was \u201cmildly surprised by the strong color, but otherwise he seemed to be smiling approvingly\u201d \u2014 and there was no shortage of commentary on social media. Commenting under a post of the portrait on the royal family\u2019s Instagram account, one user wrote: \u201cwith the uniform and that color it looks like (the) visual representation of the massacre cause by colonizers,\u201d and one said: \u201cI would have loved this if this was any other color than red. He really captured the essence of him in the face, but the harshness of the red doesn\u2019t match the softness of his expression.\u201d Another post read: \u201cLooks like he\u2019s going straight to hell.\u201d Art historian\u00a0Richard Morris\u00a0said on X, \u201cI really like the portrait\u2026 before photography, to have a great painter capture your real appearance you accepted the revelation of your flaws and your mortality. It\u2019s what Yeo captures here.\u201d While the celebrated artist works mainly in oils, he has dabbled in another medium: collage. In 2007, after a commission to paint former US President George W. Bush fell through, he decided to make an \u201cironic homage,\u201d according to his website, by collaging cutouts from hardcore pornographic magazines to create a portrait of the then US president, a satire on \u201cthe assumed moral superiority of the extreme right in American politics.\u201d It was the first in a wider series depicting public figures \u201cunderstood to have traded on their sexual morality,\u201d including Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sarah Palin, Silvio Berlusconi and British conservative activist Mary Whitehouse. As for the portrait of the K\ufeffing, Yeo said\u00a0on his website\u00a0that the vivid colors of the glazes are \u201cnot only resonating with the royal heritage found in many historical portraits but also injecting a dynamic, contemporary jolt into the genre with its uniformly powerful hue \u2014\u00a0\u00a0providing a modern contrast to more traditional depictions.\u201d He added the butterfly symbolized beauty and nature while highlighting the king\u2019s passion for the environment. Yeo\u2019s paintings are included in the permanent collection of London\u2019s National Portrait Gallery. The King is an artist himself, and a collection of his watercolors went on show in London in 2022. He has previously described painting as \u201cone of the most relaxing and therapeutic exercises I know,\u201d adding that it \u201crefreshes parts of the soul which other activities can\u2019t reach.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/style/king-charles-first-portrait-since-coronation-unveiled/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}

The villa in Grove would have been \u201ccentral for this area of Oxfordshire,\u201d Francesca Giarelli, project officer for Red River Archaeology Group and the site\u2019s director, told CNN on Thursday. She described a building that likely had multiple levels. The structure, which stretched across 1,000 square meters (10,800 square feet) on just the ground floor, was probably visible for miles, Giarelli added. Hundreds of coins, plus rings, brooches, mosaic tesserae and painted plaster with floral motifs have been uncovered during the year-long excavation, allowing archaeologists to pinpoint a long period of Roman activity at the site from the 1st or 2nd century into the late 4th or early 5th century. Archaeologists also discovered an aisled building, a bigger and more impressive hall-like structure built after the villa once the family that owned it became richer over time, Giarelli said. In Roman times, villas were not simply residential dwellings but more like \u201csmall administrative centers,\u201d Giarelli explained, often with responsibilities for maintaining roads, planning the crops surrounding it and acting as a \u201csafe space\u201d to store food products during unstable times. Even in the late Roman period, this particular villa continued to show signs of human activity. A horse-headed buckle, dated to 350-450 AD, suggests the presence of late Roman elites or someone who still wished to be associated with that period, though such buckles can also be associated with early Anglo-Saxon burials, archaeologists said in a statement to CNN. Excavating the site, described as \u201cremarkable\u201d in a press statement, began before the housing developers Barratt and David Wilson Homes started their building work and after two evaluation trenches had been dug. The trenches revealed a \u201chigh potential for archaeological presence,\u201d Giarelli said, prompting an archaeological investigation, which began two months before the building work and is still ongoing. The site still holds some mysteries to unravel in the continuing excavations.  Archaeologists haven\u2019t yet found \u201cwhere all the people ended up,\u201d Giarelli said, though they believe there is a burial somewhere on the site, and there have been some artifacts, such as the lead scrolls, that point toward a sanctuary present, but still hidden underground.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/28/style/roman-villa-development-oxfordshire-intl-scli-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "style"}}
