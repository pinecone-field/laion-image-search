The complex was decorated with painted plaster, mosaics and there was a collection of tiny, tightly-coiled lead scrolls suggesting some sort of ritual or pilgrimage might have taken place there, according to a press release. The villa in Grove would have been \u201ccentral for this area of Oxfordshire,\u201d Francesca Giarelli, project officer for Red River Archaeology Group and the site\u2019s director, told CNN on Thursday. She described a building that likely had multiple levels. The structure, which stretched across 1,000 square meters (10,800 square feet) on just the ground floor, was probably visible for miles, Giarelli added. Hundreds of coins, plus rings, brooches, mosaic tesserae and painted plaster with floral motifs have been uncovered during the year-long excavation, allowing archaeologists to pinpoint a long period of Roman activity at the site from the 1st or 2nd century into the late 4th or early 5th century. Archaeologists also discovered an aisled building, a bigger and more impressive hall-like structure built after the villa once the family that owned it became richer over time, Giarelli said. In Roman times, villas were not simply residential dwellings but more like \u201csmall administrative centers,\u201d Giarelli explained, often with responsibilities for maintaining roads, planning the crops surrounding it and acting as a \u201csafe space\u201d to store food products during unstable times. Even in the late Roman period, this particular villa continued to show signs of human activity. A horse-headed buckle, dated to 350-450 AD, suggests the presence of late Roman elites or someone who still wished to be associated with that period, though such buckles can also be associated with early Anglo-Saxon burials, archaeologists said in a statement to CNN. Excavating the site, described as \u201cremarkable\u201d in a press statement, began before the housing developers Barratt and David Wilson Homes started their building work and after two evaluation trenches had been dug. The trenches revealed a \u201chigh potential for archaeological presence,\u201d Giarelli said, prompting an archaeological investigation, which began two months before the building work and is still ongoing. The site still holds some mysteries to unravel in the continuing excavations.  Archaeologists haven\u2019t yet found \u201cwhere all the people ended up,\u201d Giarelli said, though they believe there is a burial somewhere on the site, and there have been some artifacts, such as the lead scrolls, that point toward a sanctuary present, but still hidden underground.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/28/style/roman-villa-development-oxfordshire-intl-scli-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_03_18_style_japan-shigeichi-negishi-karaoke-inventor-death-intl-hnk", "text": "Shigeichi Negishi, the entrepreneur who invented the world\u2019s first karaoke machine, has died aged 100. Negishi, whose 1967 \u201cSparko Box\u201d prototype is among several devices credited with ushering in Japan\u2019s karaoke craze, died from natural causes in January. His death, which was made public last week, was confirmed to CNN by Shiro Kataoka, managing director of the All-Japan Karaoke Industrialist Association. Born in 1923, Negishi founded and ran a company\u00a0that assembled car stereos for automobile manufacturers in northern Tokyo. A regular listener to a singalong radio show\u00a0broadcast in Japan at the time, he hooked a\u00a0spare tape deck up to a microphone and mixing circuit so he could hear himself singing over music. \u201cWhen I asked the factory engineer, he said, \u2018It\u2019s easy,\u2019\u201d Negishi recalled in an account published by the All-Japan Karaoke Industrialist Association, an industry body for Japan\u2019s karaoke operators.\u00a0\u201cSo, I attached a microphone input terminal to the car stereo and created something like the prototype of a jukebox.\u201d According to author Matt Alt, whose interview with Negishi features in his 2020 book \u201cPure Invention: How Japan Made the Modern World,\u201d the inventor first tested the device with an instrumental tape of Yoshio Kodama\u2019s 1930s song \u201cMujo no Yume.\u201d \u201cIt works!\u201d he told Alt, recalling the moment he heard his voice\u00a0coming through the speakers alongside the music. \u201cThat\u2019s all I was thinking. Most of all, it was fun. I knew right away I\u2019d discovered something new.\u201d Marketing the device as a Sparko Box, he sold them alongside lyrics cards and reportedly produced and installed around 8,000 around Japan, mainly at bars and restaurants. By the time Negishi stopped selling the products in the 1970s, several rival machines had been invented and taken to market. \u201cAt that time, it was not customary to sing in stores, so it may have been inevitable that (the Sparko Boxes were) sold as background music,\u201d reads Negishi\u2019s entry on the\u00a0All-Japan Karaoke Industrialist Association\u2019s website.\u00a0\u201cNow that I think about it, it\u2019s a bit of a shame.\u201d The industry body does not credit a single person with inventing karaoke (which literally translates as \u201cempty orchestra\u201d), but instead recognizes several people who independently created machines in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Perhaps the best known of them is musician and businessman Daisuke Inoue, whose\u00a08 Juke machine \u2014 invented in 1971, and also based on a car stereo \u2014 is credited with helping commercialize karaoke. But Inoue, like Negishi, did not patent his invention, and electronics manufacturers soon began producing and marketing their own versions. By the 1980s, \u201ckaraoke boxes\u201d (known elsewhere as KTVs) had swept Japan, with private rooms overtaking bars and restaurants as the main venues for Japan\u2019s amateur singers. Subsequent developments, including the introduction of video karaoke and networked karaoke systems, helped the phenomenon spread across Asia and the world in the following decades. Today, Japan is home to more than 8,000 dedicated karaoke box venues, while 131,500 bars are equipped with karaoke machines \u2014 a market worth\u00a0a combined 387.9 billion yen ($2.6 billion) in 2022,\u00a0according to estimates from the All-Japan Karaoke Industrialist Association.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/18/style/japan-shigeichi-negishi-karaoke-inventor-death-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}

But it is not recognized as an independent country by most governments in the world and has lost a string of diplomatic allies to Beijing in recent years. Tsai and her ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) have championed LGBTQ+ rights, making it a more liberal bastion in conservative Asia.\u00a0The self-ruled island is one of the most progressive societies for sexual minorities.\u00a0In a first for the region, Taiwan legalized same-sex marriage in 2019.\u00a0Across the strait, China has been fast moving the opposite direction under Chinese leader Xi Jinping,\u00a0with crackdowns\u00a0on LGBTQ groups and content. Taipei, Taiwan\u2019s capital, hosts East Asia\u2019s largest Pride march every October. Last year, Vice President Lai Ching-te, who will take office on Monday as Taiwan\u2019s next president, became the most senior government leader ever to attend the celebration. Reactions to the spectacle on social media were largely positive. \u201cThank you for allowing us to be at the forefront so that we can proudly show the world how free we are,\u201d said one\u00a0user commenting on Nymphia\u2019s performance on Tsai\u2019s official Facebook account, which concluded with her singing to popstar Jolin Tsai\u2019s gender equality hit \u201cWomxnly\u201d and joined by five of her fellow drag queens. \u201cI wanted to cry at the end; Taiwan has come such a long way from a time where we were called feminine, to having same sex marriage legalized and drag queens performing at the presidential palace today,\u201d wrote another. Not everyone was fan. One user wrote, \u201cI don\u2019t know what drag queens are, but I don\u2019t want my kids to be like this.\u201d While on China\u2019s Weibo, some took issue of the performance taking place in front of the bust of Sun Yat Sen, who is often called the father of modern China and whose legacy is claimed by the governments of both China and Taiwan. Nymphia, the alter-ego of Taiwanese American dressmaker Leo Tsao, was the first East Asian to win \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race,\u201d and she made it a point during her time on the show to raise awareness and appreciation of her cultural background. On the show\u2019s finale she wore a dramatic outfit inspired by bubble tea, one of Taiwan\u2019s biggest cultural exports, and many of her outfits referenced Asian heritage. Nymphia is a well-established artist on Taiwan\u2019s thriving drag scene, known for over-the-top outfits that she creates herself. She has performed in Taiwanese temples and undertook a photoshoot at wet markets dressed as bananas in various stages of ripeness. The tropical fruit is a common motif in Nymphia\u2019s creations that\u2019s become a trademark of sorts. It\u2019s a cheeky reclamation of the sometimes derogatory term used to describe Asians growing up in the West, being yellow on the outside but white on the inside. As she accepted her crown and sceptre on \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d she said: \u201cTo those who feel like they don\u2019t belong, just remember to live fearlessly and have courage to live your truth \u2013 and Taiwan this is for you!\u201d Tsai told Nymphia after her performance: \u201cI want to thank you for demonstrating your fearless beauty, standing up and breaking down barriers,\u201d adding that her story \u201cwill bring courage to many young people in Taiwan, so they stay fearless and stay true to their hearts.\u201d Additional reporting by Reuters.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/style/drag-queen-nymphia-wind-taiwan-president-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_03_29_style_kim-kardashian-donald-judd-furniture-cec", "text": "Kim Kardashian\u2019s oft-divisive interior design aesthetic is under new scrutiny. The estate of minimalist contemporary artist Donald Judd filed a lawsuit against Kardashian this week, claiming the fashion and beauty mogul promoted \u201ccheap knockoffs\u201d of his furniture designs. The basis of the suit is a 2022 video Kardashian posted to YouTube, in which she gives a guided tour of the offices for her then-brand new makeup company, Skkn by Kim. (The video, which the suit alleged received some 3.7 million views, was seemingly made private following the lawsuit filing.) While touting her office\u2019s minimalist design, Kardashian specifically praises a sleek, large-scale wooden table with a set of matching chairs that are perfectly sized to slide beneath \u2014 creating a piece resembling less a dining table and more a brutalist sculpture. \u201cThese Donald Judd tables are really amazing and totally blend in with the seats,\u201d Kardashian says, moving a chair out to show the camera. An artist and sculptor, Judd was known for his minimalist designs emphasizing clean whole shapes and industrial materials. As they appear in the video, the table and its matching chairs in Kardashian\u2019s office resemble Judd\u2019s famous La Mansana Table and Chair 84 \u2014 pieces that have become iconic among furniture designers and collectors since they were first produced in 1982. The Judd Foundation still manufactures and sells these designs, though they come at a cost: the table is priced at $90,000, while the chairs retail for $9,000 each. But Kardashian\u2019s wares were not authentic pieces, the Judd Foundation wrote in the lawsuit filed Wednesday against both Kardashian and Clements Design, the interior design firm she worked with in designing the Skkn office space. (And even if they were, the foundation \u201ccategorically prohibits customers from using purchased Donald Judd furniture for marketing and promotional purposes,\u201d it says in its court filing.) The foundation is claiming trademark infringement, copyright infringement, unfair competition, false advertising and false endorsement of the knockoff items. \u201cConsumers who watched the video or read the media coverage were misled to believe Ms. Kardashian\u2019s tables and chairs were authentic Donald Judd pieces,\u201d the foundation states in the filing. It is seeking the profits it argues Kardashian and Clements Design made off the use of Judd\u2019s name. Clements Designs, according to the court filing, said it never claimed the tables and chairs were authentic Judd pieces, and directed the foundation to settle the issue with Kardashian. In a statement provided to CNN, the design firm said the pieces it produced for Kardashian\u2019s office had \u201cobvious key differences\u201d to Judd\u2019s designs. \u201cThe Judd Foundation\u2019s prior counsel acknowledged these differences and since then, we have not heard from them in over a year, and are now being blindsided with a lawsuit,\u201d Clements Design\u2019s statement read. \u201cEfforts were made to resolve this issue amicably at the time and the Judd Foundation was unwilling to settle on reasonable terms. These claims have absolutely no merit.\u201d To add further insult, Kardashian\u2019s knockoffs were also, the lawsuit claims, seemingly made from plywood \u2014 a material that the Judd Foundation does not authorize.\u201d \u201cThese poor-quality imitations masquerading as authentic Donald Judd tables and chairs harm the Donald Judd brand,\u201d the lawsuit argues. \u201cConsumers will see the cheap knockoffs\u2026 and erroneously associate (the) low-grade pieces with the Donald Judd brand,\u201d the lawsuit states. The foundation claimed it also offered to replace the counterfeit tables and chairs with authentic pieces at a discount if Kardashian issued a retraction and edited the video, the lawsuit claims. Representatives for Kardashian offered to promote the Judd Foundation in a social media post, which the foundation rejected, and also offered to issue a retraction in the video caption, but not remove the video, the lawsuit claims. Kardashian did not respond to requests for comment from CNN. Judd, who died in 1994, was very selective about who was allowed to manufacture and carry his designs, paying particularly close attention to the quality of materials used. Only a few galleries and stores \u2014 like the MoMA Design store and the Salon 94 gallery, both in New York \u2014 are authorized to sell his furniture.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/29/style/kim-kardashian-donald-judd-furniture-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}

That watch was the \u201cmost beautiful thing I\u2019d ever seen,\u201d Stallone said in a video released by Sotheby\u2019s, and sparked a decades-long love of watch collecting. And now, the Hollywood star is auctioning 11 watches from his personal collection at a Sotheby\u2019s sale in New York on June 5. Among the items is the rare Patek Philippe Grandmaster Chime, which is expected to fetch as much as $5 million, as well as watches he wore in some of his films. Only seven models of the Grandmaster Chime were ever made, given that it is the most complicated wristwatch ever manufactured by the famous luxury watchmakers. As such, Sotheby\u2019s dubbed it the \u201choly grail\u201d for watch collectors, appreciated for its extraordinarily intricate mechanisms that took 100,000 hours to develop, produce and assemble. It features 20 complications \u2013 functions that go beyond telling the time \u2013 such as five chiming mechanisms and a date repeater which audibly indicate both the date and time. \u201cThis is not easy to come by,\u201d Stallone said. \u201cI had to appeal to certain powers that be, write many letters to the board and eventually it was determined that I was going to be the owner of one of these magnificent pieces of art.\u201d Other memorabilia comes with the watch too, including a presentation box engraved with Stallone\u2019s name and an iPad and Airpods each complete with a Patek Phillipe case. Another Patek Philippe watch, this one from its Nautilus family, is expected to sell for up to $400,000. It features an olive-green dial, surrounded by 32 Wesselton baguette diamonds, in a stainless steel casing. Several other notable watchmakers are represented in the auction too, including models that Stallone wore while on camera. A Rolex watch released in 2016 to mark the 60th anniversary of a model that was the first to display both day and date separately could sell for $50,000. Meanwhile, a watch made by Audemars Piguet featuring a blue face inside a pink gold case is estimated to fetch up to $200,000. Also included in the auction are several Panerai watches, a brand that Stallone has long championed and worn on camera in the 1996 movie \u201cDaylight.\u201d A model exclusively made for him, with an engraving commemorating that on the back, is among the watches featured in this auction and is expected to sell for up to $60,000.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/07/style/sylvester-stallone-watch-collection-auction-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}

The letter sent to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), and seen by CNN, said that: \u201cHer Majesty will not procure any new fur garments.\u201d It is unclear, however, what the Queen\u2019s position is with regard to fur items in her existing wardrobe. The move follows a similar stand taken by her late mother-in-law, Queen Elizabeth II, who ruled out buying new fur products back in 2019. The palace\u2019s correspondence was in response to a letter sent by PETA to the Queen in April.

Roberts, an actor who has become a mainstay of rom coms and campy horror \u2014 the latter, most recently with recurring roles in the anthology series \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d \u2014 bought the home, which she shares with her three-year-old son Rhodes, in 2022 and hired the design firm Pierce & Ward to overhaul its interiors. In the May issue of Architectural Digest, she reveals the results of that makeover. For Roberts, having a space that feels like home is a particular priority, she explained, as she moved often as a child. So when she saw the property listed as a rental on Instagram (it has been reported as a former residence of Minnie Driver), she inquired if she could purchase it instead. \u201cI think I lived in 10 houses by the time I was 15 \u2014 so for me now, having a son, I wanted a place that felt really ours.\u201d she told AD. \u201cI have a picture of the day we moved in\u2026 I just remember feeling like we are exactly where we need to be.\u201d The designers, Louisa Pierce and Emily Ward, with whom Roberts had previously worked, are known for down-to-earth spaces that mix bohemian, mid-century modern and rustic styles. Their clients have included Roberts\u2019 \u201cMadame Web\u201d co-star Dakota Johnson as well as Kate Hudson and Leonardo DiCaprio. \u201cWe want a house to look like it\u2019s been there for 50 years,\u201d Pierce told AD in the cover story. \u201cWe never want a home to look new.\u201d In that spirit, much of Roberts\u2019 furniture, art and decor is repurposed or reupholstered. In the living room, beneath a disco ball-like globe light, paperbacks are enclosed in living room cabinets while rarer books are openly displayed. Framed photographs of Debbie Harry and Joni Mitchell rest on wooden cabinets; elsewhere, one of Roberts\u2019 most treasured artworks \u2014 a Julian Wasser portrait of Joan Didion in front of a Corvette \u2014 hangs on the wall. Though many pieces are courtesy of design studios or antique finds, Pierce and Ward don\u2019t look down on more accessible commercial brands. Roberts recalled when she asked if her new kitchen island was custom-made, they laughed and said it was from Urban Outfitters. As for a room for Rhodes, who is starting his own book collection, Roberts opted for a soothing wallpaper scene of flying ducks on the ceiling, above a lush forest-themed upholstered bed. \u201cI remember as a kid, whatever\u2019s on your wall and your ceiling is seared into your brain for the rest of your life,\u201d Roberts explained. \u201cSo I wanted to make it extra cozy and fun, but not too overwhelming.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/16/style/emma-roberts-la-home-architectural-digest/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "style_yushi-li-the-smothering-dream-snap", "text": " A group of men lie at the foot of a sofa, their naked bodies peeking out through a carpet of rose petals. Some look toward the photograph\u2019s protagonist, an Asian woman in a lime green dress laying across the cushioned loveseat. Others gaze away, seemingly indifferent, as if caught in some sort of hazy spell. Despite Chinese photographer Yushi Li\u2019s gentle staging, her title for the photograph, \u201cThe Smothering Dream,\u201d suggests something more sinister is at play. Referencing Dutch painter Lawrence Alma-Tadema\u2019s 1888 work \u201cThe Roses of Heliogabalus,\u201d in which a Roman emperor watches on as unsuspecting banquet guests slowly suffocate in flowers, Li\u2019s modern take \u2014 shot on a set awash with pastel colors and delicate furniture \u2014 is equally deceptive at first glance. Li, is not only the photographer, but also the muse at the center of the image. \u201cI made this very pink and kitsch dream,\u201d she said, describing the London living room set in a phone interview. \u201cBut underneath it, there is, like, some kind of violence. It\u2019s a fantasy of love and eroticism\u2026 smothering these men I desire.\u201d Shot in 2022, \u201cThe Smothering Dream\u201d was recently on show at Photofairs Shanghai as part of a group exhibition called \u201cA Quiet Gaze.\u201d It was a fitting title to showcase the work of an artist for whom an examination of the male and female gazes has been a recurring theme. Li\u2019s wider portfolio of subversive images include softly-lit nude portraits of strangers she scouted through a dating app (a series titled \u201cMy Tinder Boys\u201d). Stripped of their clothes and therefore their character, she said, the men lounge around their homes doing banal tasks: one scoops out of a fresh watermelon, while another casually balances a plate of spaghetti over his private parts. The series is partly a response to erotic images objectifying women that are historically ubiquitous in art, advertisements and photography. Although a canon of male nudes does exist, it largely comprises images shot by gay male photographers. When Li began the series in 2017, she noticed a lack of images depicting naked men as objects of desire from a woman\u2019s perspective. After some mistook her work as being shot by a male photographer, she began inserting herself into the photos \u2014 fully clothed alongside naked counterparts, and often the only person looking directly at the camera. \u201cInstead of being a passive, \u2018looked-at\u2019 thing, I want to be the one who is in control, who is creating the story, who is expressing my fantasy,\u201d said Li. Her images have also pushed back against the longstanding fetishization of Asian women, often by Western men, something Li said she has experienced first-hand: \u201cI\u2019m a small person, and come across as quiet, so I kind of fit the stereotype.\u201d Li, who was born in China\u2019s Hunan province and now lives in the UK. She said she feels flattered when women reach out to her online to say they feel empowered by her photographs. \u201cAs a woman, especially as an Asian or Chinese woman, you (should be able to) feel that you can also express your erotic desire.\u201d Who\u2019s in power? Li has been fascinated with how the idea of the gaze has, today, become \u201cless binary.\u201d She has also been examining and playing with the way classical paintings depict power dynamics, portrayals of desire and representations of the body. She brings these ideas into \u201cPaintings, Dreams and Love,\u201d an ongoing project to which \u201cThe Smothering Dream\u201d belongs. (A second photo from the same shoot, entitled \u201cAfter the Dream,\u201d hints at what has just taken place, with satin cushions and wilted petals strewn about the scene). Other sources of inspiration include Swiss painter Henry Fuseli\u2019s 1781 \u201cThe Nightmare,\u201d showing an incubus crouching menacingly atop a sleeping woman, and \u201cThe Death of Actaeon,\u201d Renaissance painter Titian\u2019s 16th-century oil painting of the Romans\u2019 goddess of the hunt, Diana, transforming the Theban hero into a stag that is then killed by his own hounds. In Li\u2019s reinterpretations, she is in full control. In the former, she wears a tight, red turtleneck as she casually sits on an unsuspecting male figure, thwarting the idea of seduction.

{"id": "2024_05_20_style_kehinde-wiley-joseph-awuah-darko-sexual-assault-accusations", "text": "Kehinde Wiley, the American artist best known for painting former US President Barack Obama\u2019s official portrait, has denied accusations of sexual assault. In an Instagram post shared Sunday, British-Ghanaian artist and curator Joseph Awuah-Darko alleged Wiley sexually assaulted him twice in 2021. Awuah-Darko said the first incident occurred on June 9, 2021, at a dinner held at the Noldor Artist Residency in Ghana, to celebrate Wiley\u2019s work. Awuah-Darko is the founder and chairman of the Accra-based program. In the post, he claimed he was \u201cinappropriately groped\u201d by Wiley, in front of another guest, and that the action was \u201cunwelcome and unprovoked.\u201d He then described a second incident that day as \u201cmuch more severe and violent,\u201d without elaborating further. (In a subsequent interview with the New York Times, he claimed that \u201ca sexual encounter began consensually, but that it then moved to a bedroom, where\u2026 Mr. Wiley forced himself on him after Mr. Awuah-Darko had said he did not want to go further.\u201d) The assaults \u201calmost destroyed me,\u201d Awuah-Darko wrote in the post, adding he hoped that others would feel empowered to come forward. Shortly after the post was published, Wiley denied the allegations, writing on his own Instagram that, \u201cSomeone I had a brief, consensual relationship with almost three years ago is now making a false accusation about our time together. These claims are not true and are an affront to all victims of sexual abuse.\u201d \u201cI have no idea why he has decided to target me in this way \u2014 particularly when there is a litany of evidence showing his claims are false \u2014 but I hope he gets the help he needs for whatever he is going through,\u201d Wiley continued. \u201cI kindly ask for privacy as I work to clear my name. Representatives for Wiley provided CNN with a copy of a cease and desist letter they say was sent to Awuah-Darko demanding he immediately remove what they describe as \u201ccategorically false and defamatory,\u201d Instagram posts. The letter frames Awuah-Darko\u2019s claims as \u201cmalicious\u201d and intended to \u201cruin (Wiley\u2019s) reputation for\u2026 financial gain and attention.\u201d CNN was also shown copies of messages between Awuah-Darko and Wiley which representatives for Wiley assert were sent in the months following the alleged assault. In some, Awuah-Darko appears to be making arrangements to attend a birthday party for Wiley in Nigeria; in another he asks if he could visit Wiley at his home in upstate New York. (It appears Wiley failed to respond to this message.) Awuah-Darko and his legal representative did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s requests for further comment on his allegations, as well as Wiley\u2019s response, however, in his Sunday statement on Instagram, he said he \u201cdid not immediately confront the reality of my abuse as such,\u201d and that it took\u00a0\u201cseveral months to reconcile with what had actually happened.\u201d \u201cI am aware I\u2019m not the perfect sexual assault victim,\u201d Awuah-Darko told the New York Times, \u201cbut this is what happened to me.\u201d In an earlier Instagram video posted in March, Awuah-Darko had claimed he was \u201csexually assaulted by someone who outranks me in privilege, power\u2026\u201d and that he was aiming to raise $200,000 for legal fees. Awuah-Darko said Monday that he planned on taking legal action in a post on his Instagram stories. Awuah-Darko\u2019s legal representative did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s requests for further comment. In Sunday\u2019s Instagram post, he wrote that reporting the assault in Ghana \u201cwould have been problematic at best \u2014 dangerous at worst,\u201d given the country\u2019s broader attitudes towards LGBTQ people. In February, Ghana\u2019s parliament passed a controversial bill that criminalizes LGBTQ relationships and those who support LGBTQ rights. Wiley rose to international fame in 2017, when he was chosen to paint Obama\u2019s official portrait for the Smithsonian\u2019s National Portrait Gallery. The result was a vibrant depiction of the 44th president against a backdrop of green foliage and symbolic flowers. Before that, the Yale University-trained painter had already built a career in portraiture and sculpture, depicting Black people posed in the style of Old Master paintings to bold, ornate effect.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/style/kehinde-wiley-joseph-awuah-darko-sexual-assault-accusations/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}

The girls decided to step down and give (up) their dream of a lifetime \u2014 a crown, a national title. Why would two girls decide to give that up?\u201d It is the first time the mothers have spoken publicly about the ordeal, which roiled the pageant world last week. It marked the first time a titleholder in Miss USA or Miss Teen USA had resigned, and both happened in quick succession. On Instagram, UmaSofia Srivastava said her values \u201cno longer aligned\u201d with those of the organization, while Noelia Voigt cited her mental health, though her long, cryptic statement seemed to spell out \u201cI am silenced\u201d in the first 11 sentences. Speaking on Good Morning America, Jackeline declined to answer whether the supposed secret message was intentional. But responding to whether she feels as if her daughter was silenced, she said \u201cShe is, and she would be the rest of her life if this NDA is not (lifted).\u201d Voigt\u2019s resignation letter to Miss USA, obtained and published by CNN on Saturday, revealed a range of allegations against Miss USA CEO Laylah Rose, including a \u201ctoxic work environment\u201d rife with \u201cbullying.\u201d According to the letter, Rose is \u201cactively building a culture of fear and control, the antithesis of women\u2019s empowerment, that is\u2026unsafe for future titleholders and employees,\u201d Voigt wrote. Among the issues, Voigt claimed that Rose failed to provide her with appropriate travel accommodations or an \u201ceffective handler,\u201d leading to an incident where she was left alone in a car with a stranger at a parade in Sarasota, Florida, where an unnamed man sexually harassed her, she wrote. Her mother, who was with her in Sarasota, saw her just after the alleged incident occurred, she said in the interview. \u201cI saw Noelia so stressed out, and I said, \u2018What happened?\u2019 and she said, \u2018Mom, get in the car,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cHe told Noelia, \u2018Are you into old men with money?\u2019 and made Noelia very, very uncomfortable.\u201d Rose did not apologize, according to Jackeline. In her resignation letter, Voigt said that Rose told her that the organization \u201ccannot prevent people saying things to you at public appearances\u201d and that it is \u201cunfortunately, part of the role.\u201d Barbara Srivastava said that during their reigning year, the titleholders were \u201cill-treated, abused, bullied and cornered.\u201d Jackeline called for the Miss Universe Organization, which owns Miss USA, to \u201cspeak to us or apologize.\u201d The parent organization, owned by JKN Global Group, has been silent over the past week. The Miss USA and Miss Universe Organization did not immediately return a request for comment, and did not respond to CNN\u2019s earlier requests for comments on Friday. For now, the mothers are warning prospective pageant contestants about getting involved with Miss USA. On Wednesday, the runner-up for Miss USA, Savannah Gankiewicz from Hawaii, will step up and take the title in a ceremony. But Miss Teen USA remains open, as the runner-up from 2023, New York\u2019s Stephanie Skinner, declined to be crowned in a public statement on Instagram. CNN has contacted the second runner-up, Miss Pennsylvania Teen Maggie Ross, on whether she will take the title, but no announcement has been made. \u201cLook at what happened to Noelia and UmaSofia.

{"id": "2024_05_22_style_china-rihanna-fenty-beauty-promotion-intl-hnk", "text": "There\u2019s a reason why Rihanna is a billionaire. She\u2019s a business mogul in every sense: Aside from a prolific music career, she\u2019s launched successful brands including her cosmetics empire Fenty Beauty \u2013 worth an estimated $2.8 billion according to Forbes \u2013 and her lingerie label Savage X Fenty. Her latest move in China to promote makeup products is something of a masterclass in how to tap into its lucrative \u2013 mostly online \u2013 Gen Z market. On Tuesday night, the chart-topping singer attended a Fenty Beauty pop-up held at a Shanghai photography museum, \u201cservin\u2019 face\u201d according to brand\u2019s Instagram, and \u201cjianbing\u201d \u2013 a popular Chinese breakfast crepe that costs about a dollar. Dressed in a head-to-toe black ensemble, Rihanna cracked an egg, spread yolk, sprinkled scallions, brushed sauce and placed a crunchy cracker onto the savory street food favorite, made on a glittery food cart. Influential makeup bloggers invited to attend captured the spectacle and Chinese social media sprung to life. \u201cShe makes crepes but not her new album,\u201d joked one user on Douyin, China\u2019s TikTok, while another wrote on Weibo, \u201cShe\u2019s so good at it, it\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s her first time.\u201d Rihanna is already a beloved star in China, recently appearing on April\u2019s Vogue China cover. She has been viewed as appreciating Chinese culture, famously wearing a glorious golden yellow creation by master couturier Guo Pei to 2015\u2019s China-themed Met Gala. And the decision to serve up jianbing was a savvy move \u2013 one that embraced the star\u2019s moniker among Chinese fans and displayed knowledge of her audience. In 2011, Chinese fans dubbed her the \u201cQueen of Shandong,\u201d after her hit \u201cWe Found Love\u201d was phonetically translated to \u201cweifang de ai\u201d \u2013 meaning love of Weifang, a city in eastern China\u2019s Shandong province. Jianbing is believed to have originated from the same province more than 2,000 years ago and for many in China, the 36-year-old\u2019s turn at making the humble crepe was a full circle moment, with one viral comment on Weibo reading \u201cshe\u2019s certified her own Chinese nickname\u201d with the act. The jianbing buzz only added to the chatter online about the singer\u2019s appearance earlier in the day on Douyin, where she hosted three livestream sessions showcasing Fenty Beauty lip glosses, blushes and other products. Rihanna then became the number one trending topic on Weibo, with the hashtag #RihannasfirstlivestreaminChina viewed over 81 million times. Another hashtag, #RihannashowsupinShanghai was viewed over 75 million times. Besides being a video app, Douyin is a major platform for online shopping \u2013 with products and discounts displayed on-screen during livestreams and purchases just a swipe or a click away. In 2022, there were more than 460 million livestreaming e-commerce users in mainland China, according to the Academy of China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, a body affiliated with Beijing\u2019s commerce ministry. Other foreign luxury brands have already hosted their own livestream sessions, including Gucci, Dior and Louis Vuitton. China is now the world\u2019s second largest beauty market. Rihanna\u2019s appearance was part of the platform\u2019s wider \u201c618\u201d (or June 18) campaign, one of China\u2019s most important online shopping events after Singles Day in November, that sees widespread promotions starting nearly a month ahead. While Fenty Beauty products have been available in the country since 2019, the brand announced this March that it would be expanding its presence via Sephora stores on the mainland. In 2017, the brand launched with an unprecedented 40 shades of foundation and has since added more. Its outsized profitability has dramatically shifted the beauty landscape, with many companies now offering their own more diverse and inclusive range of cosmetics.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/style/china-rihanna-fenty-beauty-promotion-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_19_style_isabella-gardner-heist-facts", "text": "Most art galleries and museums are famous for the art they contain. London\u2019s National Gallery has Van Gogh\u2019s \u201cSunflowers\u201d; \u201cThe Starry Night\u201d meanwhile, is held at The Museum of Modern Art in New York, in good company alongside Salvador Dal\u00ec\u2019s melting clocks, Andy Warhol\u2019s soup cans and Frida Kahlo\u2019s self-portrait. The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, however, is now more famous for the artwork that is not there, or at least, that is no longer there. On March 18 1990 the museum fell prey to history\u2019s biggest art heist. Thirteen works of art estimated to be worth over half a billion dollars \u2014 including three Rembrandts and a Vermeer \u2014 were stolen in the middle of the night, while the two security guards sat in the basement bound in duct tape. A new episode of CNN\u2019s \u201cHow It Really Happened\u201d airing Sunday 19 May at 9P ET/ PT features an interview with one of those guards: Rick Abath, who gave his only TV interview to CNN in 2013, and who died in February 2024 aged 57. The robbery is a treasure trove of surprising facts and unexpected plot twists. Here are five things that make the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, and its famous theft, so interesting. The woman behind the building Isabella Stewart Gardner, the museum\u2019s founder and namesake, is a fascinating character. The daughter and eventual widow of two successful businessmen, Gardner was a philanthropist and art collector who built the museum to house her stash. \u201cWhen she opened the museum in 1903 she mandated that it be free of charge, to gain the appreciation and the attendance of all of Boston,\u201d Stephan Kurkjian, author of \u201cMaster Thieves: The Boston Gangsters Who Pulled Off the World\u2019s Greatest Art Heist\u201d, told CNN in the programme. \u201cHer museum, at that point in time, was the largest collection of art by a private individual in America.\u201d Gardner also had links to the fledgling campaign for women\u2019s political rights. The museum displays the photographs and letters of her friend Julia Ward Howe, an organizer of two US suffrage societies, and a print of Ethel Smyth, a composer and close friend of the English Suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst. Gardner met Smyth through their mutual friend, the painter John Singer Sargent, whose portrait of Gardener raised eyebrows for the low-cut neckline he gave her. Gardner seemed to enjoy flirting with scandal and gossip: she once arrived at a Boston Symphony Orchestra performance in a hat band emblazoned with the name of her favorite baseball team, Red Sox, and an illustration in a January 1897 edition of the Boston Globe showed her apparently taking one of Boston Zoo\u2019s lions for a walk. Somewhat ironically, when the Mona Lisa was stolen in 1911, Gardner told her museum guards that, if they saw anyone trying to rob them, they should shoot to kill. The art not taken The thieves\u2019 loot is estimated to be worth over half a billion dollars. However, they left the building\u2019s most expensive artifact: \u201cThe Rape of Europa\u201d by Titian, which Gardner bought from a London art gallery in 1896, then a record price for an old master painting. Why commit history\u2019s greatest art heist and leave without the priciest piece in the museum? Well, size may have played a role. The largest artwork taken was Rembrandt\u2019s \u201cChrist in the Storm on the Sea of Galilee,\u201d famous for being Rembrandt\u2019s only seascape and measures roughly 5x4 feet. \u201cThe Rape of Europa,\u201d meanwhile, is larger, at nearly 6x7 feet. The Napoleon factor Around 2005, the investigation into the stolen artworks took a detour to the French island of Corsica in the Meditteranean Sea. Two Frenchmen with alleged ties to the Corsican mob were trying to sell two paintings: a Rembrandt and a Vermeer. Former FBI Special Agent Bob Wittman was involved in a sting to try and buy them \u2014 but the operation eventually fell apart when the men were arrested for selling art taken from the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in Nice instead. Why would \u201cCorsican mobsters,\u201d as CNN correspondent Randi Kaye described them in the programme, be interested in robbing a Boston art museum? The answer could lie in the Bronze Eagle Finial, the 10-inch ornament stolen from the top of a Napoleonic flag during the heist. \u201cIt was sort of an odd choice for the thieves to take (the Finial),\u201d Kaye said, \u201cbut it turns out that Corsica is essentially the homeland of Napoleon.\u201d The French emperor was born on the island in 1769, and a national museum is now housed in his former family home. \u201cIt is a very compelling notion,\u201d Kelly Horan, Deputy Editor of the Boston Globe, said in the programme, \u201cthat a Corsican band of gangsters might have tried to steal back their flag and pull off the entire rest of the heist in the process.\u201d A rock\u2019n\u2019roll suspect March 18 1990 was not the first time a Rembrandt had been stolen from a Boston museum. In 1975, career criminal and art thief Myles Connor walked into Boston\u2019s Museum of Fine Arts, and walked out with a Rembrandt tucked into his oversized coat pocket. He was the FBI\u2019s first suspect in the Gardner case, however the walls of federal prison \u2014 where he was incarcerated on drugs charges \u2014 gave him a pretty solid alibi. When he wasn\u2019t lifting famous artworks from their displays, Connor was a musician. It was through gigging that he met Al Dotoli, who worked with stars including Frank Sinatra and Liza Minelli. In 1976 Connor was jailed for a separate art theft committed in Maine. Hoping to use his stolen Rembrandt to leverage a lesser sentence, he needed Dotoli \u2014 who was on tour with Dionne Warwick \u2014 to turn the painting in to the authorities on his behalf. An invisible thief? One of the stolen artworks, \u00c9douard Manet\u2019s \u201cChez Tortoni,\u201d was taken from the museum\u2019s Blue Room on the first floor. The painting stands out for two reasons, the first being its frame. The thieves left almost all of the frames behind, cutting some out of the front. \u201cTo even leave remnants of the painting(s) behind was savage,\u201d Horan said. \u201cIn my mind, it\u2019s sort of like slashing someone\u2019s throat.\u201d The \u201cChez Tortoni\u201d frame was unusual for where it was left, though: not in the room it was stolen from, but in the chair of the security office downstairs. Even more remarkable, not a single motion detector was set off in the Blue Room. Bar investigating the possibility of ghost robbers, investigators wondered if this pointed to the plot being an inside job. \u201cAt the FBI we found that about 89% of museum institutional heists are inside jobs,\u201d Wittman said. \u201cThat\u2019s how these things get stolen.\u201d How It Really Happened\u2019s \u201cGardner Art Heist: Stealing Beauty\u201d premieres on CNN Sunday 19 May, at 9pm ET/PT.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/style/isabella-gardner-heist-facts/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}

{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_11_style_miss-usa-pageant-organization-allegations", "text": "During their year of service, pageant queens are highly visible, making appearances at major events, advocating for important causes and speaking at public engagements, all in an official capacity. But following the shocking double resignation of Miss USA 2023 Noelia Voigt and Miss Teen USA 2023 UmaSofia Srivastava this week, just days apart, insiders are painting a picture of national titleholders kept absent from their usual duties, their organization in disarray, and key players who appear to be unable to voice their experiences \u2014 and concerns. The Miss USA organization, which runs both pageants, has come under fire amid accusations of mismanagement, a hostile work environment, and conditions that led, in particular, to Voigt\u2019s resignation on the grounds that her role was impacting her mental health. While Srivastava, 16, who represented New Jersey at Miss Teen USA, released a statement on Instagram saying that her personal values \u201cno longer fully align\u201d with those of the organization, Voigt, 24, who represented Utah at Miss USA, wrote a long but cryptic post, citing her mental health. Soon, however, it went viral for an apparent hidden message \u2014 the first letter of the first 11 sentences spelled out \u201cI am silenced.\u201d (Voigt has not subsequently addressed this speculation.) \u201cWe respect and support Noelia\u2019s decision to step down from her duties,\u201d the Miss USA pageant said in a statement following Voigt\u2019s announcement. \u201cThe well-being of our titleholders is a top priority, and we understand her need to prioritize herself at this time.\u201d The organization has not returned CNN\u2019s request for further comment. In response, a number of current state titleholders who competed alongside Voigt for Miss USA \u2014 including Miss North Carolina USA 2023 Jordyn Ashlee McKey, Miss Wisconsin USA 2023 Alexis Loomans and Miss New York USA, Rachelle di Stasio \u2014 shared social media messages in support of Voigt, asking the organization to \u201crelease Noelia from the confidentiality NDA clause of her contract, in perpetuity, so that she is free to speak on her experiences and time as Miss USA.\u201d Denise White, a PR representative for both Srivastava and Voigt \u2014 and the 1994 Miss Oregon USA \u2014 alleged that both winners are restricted by \u201cironclad\u201d non-disclosure agreements in their contracts. To date, neither Voigt or Srivastava has publicly revealed more about what led them to quit. But in a resignation letter provided to the Miss USA organization and obtained by CNN, Voigt outlined a number of concerns, ranging from frustrating managerial issues to more serious allegations. In it, she described a \u201ctoxic work environment\u201d that \u201cat best, is poor management and, at worst, is bullying and harassment.\u201d She accused the pageant\u2019s CEO, Laylah Rose, of \u201cslandering\u201d her character in conversations with people inside and outside of the organization, including calling Voigt \u201cmentally ill.\u201d Rose is an entrepreneur and CEO of the VIP Pageantry Network, who took over the brand in 2023. Voigt says Rose\u2019s communications to her were \u201ccold and unnecessarily aggressive,\u201d and that she never received a formal meeting about her responsibilities. Despite the lack of communication about her role, she was \u201cconstantly\u2026 threatened with disciplinary action, including taking away my salary,\u201d according to the document. The organization failed to arrange travel accommodations for Voigt on multiple occasions, she wrote, and did not provide her with an apartment and car for months, as had been outlined in her prize package. Nor did she have an \u201ceffective handler,\u201d she claimed, the latter leading to an instance where Voigt says she was sexually harassed during a Christmas parade event in Sarasota, Florida, while alone with an unnamed person in a car. According to Voigt\u2019s letter, Rose is \u201cactively building a culture of fear and control, the antithesis of women\u2019s empowerment, that is\u2026unsafe for future titleholders and employees.\u201d Nor, she wrote, can she publicly voice her concerns, saying she is \u201csilenced contractually from being able to speak up for myself.\u201d \u2018Things are falling apart\u2019 Voigt and Srivastava\u2019s respective resignations were not coordinated, according to White. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve witnessed and seen is harassment, a toxic work environment and bullying,\u201d White said in a telephone interview with CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s just not conducive to a women\u2019s organization that uplifts women and is supposed to promote using your voice. It\u2019s quite the opposite.\u201d Both pageant winners sought out support from management at Miss Universe, which owns the Miss USA organization, without success, she added. \u201cBoth young ladies were always trying to resolve any issues quietly behind the scenes,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe fact that Miss Universe Organization has not even responded to Noelia\u2019s resignation at this point is just stonewalling\u2026 No wonder things are falling apart. Because nobody knows what to do.\u201d The Miss Universe organization and Rose, through Miss USA, did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Voigt\u2019s pageant coach, Thom Brodeur, who has worked with Miss USA contestants since 1991 and began working with Voigt while she was preparing for Miss Utah, emphasized new and ominous territory for the organization under Rose. \u201cNo woman has ever resigned as Miss USA or as Miss Teen USA, and she\u2019s lost both of them in 48 hours,\u201d he said. Even before Voigt and Srivastava stepped down, there was turmoil in the organization, according to White, Brodeur and Miss USA\u2019s former social media director, Claudia Engelhardt, who also resigned in recent days. Engelhardt claimed on Instagram that she had worked without pay for two months after being hired, and that she had seen a \u201cdecline\u201d in Voigt\u2019s mental health, and witnessed \u201cdisrespect\u201d toward Srivastava and members of her family. And according to Engelhardt, they were far from the only members of the Miss USA organization to depart. When she began her role in January, she was part of an already small team of five employees. Now, she says, after multiple firings and resignations, the team is down to Rose and one other employee. Multiple sources said the turnover has been constant. \u201cThis is not a state pageant. This is not a local pageant. You need\u2026 a whole team,\u201d Engelhardt said in a phone call with CNN. Engelhardt said she believed she was applying for a freelance role, and was surprised to find she was being hired as staff. Still, she claimed, she received no employee contract, no onboarding and no guidance. There was no one else to help her manage the day-to-day social media needs of the national brand, she said, and often came up against what she framed as Rose\u2019s overbearing approach to their social accounts. \u201cShe would block Instagram accounts with people that she had personal discrepancies with. She would censor comments, and she would leave comments for the Miss USA page as if she was Noelia,\u201d Engelhardt claimed. White also alleged that Rose impersonated the two pageant winners on their official accounts. Weeks before Voigt resigned, she announced in a now-deleted Instagram post on her personal account that she \u201cno longer had access\u201d to her Miss USA pages. An uneasy path forward Engelhardt said she witnessed firsthand the impact of the role on Voigt, who she considers a friend as well as a former colleague. \u201c(I saw) how stressed out she would get when the owner would constantly bombard her with emails,\u201d she recalled. \u201cShe was constantly living in an anxious state.\u201d But despite the day-to-day stressors, Voigt alleged that she only made few public appearances. She said in her letter that, aside from a handful of press interviews in Los Angeles following her win and subsequent ones in Utah, the state she had represented at the Miss USA pageant, she had \u201cyet to make an appearance outside of Sarasota, Florida,\u201d where she was living. This was due to a \u201clack of communication\u201d that she found \u201cbaffling,\u201d she wrote. \u201cOur Miss USA, who should have been booked and busy (with) endless opportunities was sitting around doing nothing, and it\u2019s not because she didn\u2019t want to, but because of mismanagement,\u201d Engelhardt said. On May 9, the Miss USA pageant announced that Savannah Gankiewicz, Miss Hawaii USA 2023 and first-runner up to Voigt at the 2023 Miss USA pageant, would be taking over the national title and its responsibilities. She will be officially crowned on May 15. \u201cWe are proud to crown Savannah Miss USA 2023, A true representation of vision, intelligence, and compassion,\u201d Rose said in a statement. \u201cHer dedication to empowering women through self-love and confidence is inspiring, and we look forward to her impactful reign as Miss USA.\u201d \u201cI fully support and respect Noelia\u2019s decision to step down, and I stand in solidarity with mental health awareness,\u201d Gankiewicz\u00a0added. \u201cTo my fellow Miss USA sisters, I believe it\u2019s crucial for us to stand united for the future of the organization and the incoming class of 2024 and beyond.\u201d Though many have offered their public support for the two resigned pageant winners \u2014 including\u00a0Shanna Moakler, who oversaw Voigt\u2019s win in her role as the state director for the Miss Utah USA pageant, and Cindy Provost and Debbie Miller, who oversaw Srivastava\u2019s win in their role as state directors for the Miss New Jersey Teen USA pageant \u2014 Engelhardt and White both hope that others will step up to reveal more about what they see as a stifling culture, as well as potential legal ramifications, that are keeping the titleholders quiet. \u201cThey need somebody else to speak up for them,\u201d White said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/style/miss-usa-pageant-organization-allegations/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}

Big Biba \u2014 a daring, 20,000 square foot destination by fashion illustrator Barbara Hulanicki and her former marketing executive husband, Stephen Fitz-Simon \u2014 was conceived with a level of detail usually reserved for high-end concept stores.\u00a0Opened in September 1973,\u00a0it was the\u00a0fourth and final outpost of the-then iconic brand.\u00a0The\u00a0seven-floor Art Deco emporium on London\u2019s fashionable Kensington High Street featured\u00a0a soup stand inspired by Andy Warhol, a roof garden featuring real flamingos and penguins, and a much-lauded celebrity hotspot the \u201cRainbow Room\u201d. \u201cBecause the Rainbow Room looked the way it did, it didn\u2019t take long for the glitterati to latch on; it was very much a place to be seen dining,\u201d recalled Thomas in an interview with CNN. Originally designed by architect Marcel Hennequet in 1933 and named after its multi-colored ceiling (the dining room was otherwise all white tablecloths and fake plants), it \u201cbecame a venue of choice,\u201d he suggested. \u201cDavid Bowie, Mick Jagger, Bryan Ferry all dropped in.\u201d \u201cFitz employed the son of a friend who had an extraordinary knack of picking people up, like Ian Dury and the Blockheads,\u201d continued Thomas, recalling the unofficial booker. \u201cHe got the New York Dolls to play when they came over, another coup. They did a vandalizing tour of the first floor, shoplifting all the women\u2019s clothes.\u201d These stories and more are all explored in \u201cWelcome to Big Biba,\u201d Thomas\u2019s gold-fronted monograph of the venture republished this month by ACC Art Books to celebrate the brand\u2019s 60th anniversary. \u201cThis book is a testament to creative freedom,\u201d writes the now 87-year-old Hulanicki in the foreword, reflecting on her legacy. \u201cYou can do it all as long as you learn to wear a suit.

Singer Annie Lennox described the venture as having led \u201cthe way for those of us living in provincial places where we felt we were dying of drabness.\u201d Inspired by decadent styles from bygone times \u2014 albeit with drastically shortened hemlines \u2014 in earthy or muted colors such as olive, rust and \u201cbruised purple,\u201d Biba\u2019s wares certainly struck a chord with young female shoppers, and the brand rode the wave of what Thomas described as \u201cthe first burst of teenage energy and finance availability.\u201d \u201cBiba made fashion democratic,\u201d explained Martin Pel, author of \u201cThe Biba Years 1963-1975\u201d and curator of a new exhibition at London\u2019s Fashion & Textile Museum, in an email. \u201cThis expression is often overused of designers in the 1960s, particularly Mary Quant. Quant\u2019s clothes whilst youthful, were expensive. Biba was inexpensive, well designed, good quality, and up-to-the-minute.\u201d By September 1964, Hulanicki and Fitz-Simon had opened their first brick and mortar store in a former drugstore, twice moving the business into bigger premises throughout the 60s. In 1966 the brand\u2019s second shop on Kensington Church Street \u2014 where Vogue editor Anna Wintour famously did a stint as a Saturday girl \u2014 was described by Vanity Fair magazine as \u201cthe most exotic shop in London.\u201d and in the early 1970s, a boutique launched in New York\u2019s Bergdorf Goodman department store. \u201cAn act of bravery\u201d Interior designer Thomas had already designed Hulanicki and Fitz-Simon\u2019s home and the third Biba store in 1968 before being approached about the landmark seven-level store. \u201cFitz offered me two floors (of Big Biba) but I wanted it all,\u201d he recalled of his initial involvement. \u201cA moment of complete lunacy, considering Tim (Whitmore, his creative partner) and I were ex-painting students working out of my bedroom. It was an extraordinary act of bravery on their part, giving us the contract, it wouldn\u2019t happen today.\u201d Stocking Big Biba\u2019s seven floors was equal parts intimidating and invigorating said Thomas, explaining that he and Whitmore worked closely with Hulanicki throughout. \u201cBiba was always a reflection of Barbara\u2019s life,\u201d he noted, \u201cso because Barbara had a kid, of course we had a kid\u2019s floor,\u201d with d\u00e9cor inspired by Disney World, a carousel ride and miniature cottage kids caf\u00e9 with toadstool seating. On Saturdays, an actor would visit and read stories and a cr\u00e8che \u2014 a revolutionary concept in fashion retail now, let alone 50 years ago \u2014 allowed parents freedom to explore the other floors. A maternity section and a space for 11-13 year old\u2019s were similarly modern for the time, likewise the introduction of communal changing rooms \u2014 although true to the spirit of the times, many clients reportedly changed in the middle of the store itself. Elsewhere menswear took over the third floor, complete with a \u201cmistress\u201d section for purchasing more sensual items with discretion. Biba-branded household items were upstairs. While each floor took on its own theme (maternity for example was fitted with comedic outsized furniture, inspired by Ken Russell\u2019s 1971 musical comedy \u201cThe Boyfriend\u201d), much of the store was furnished in Biba\u2019s distinctive black and gold colorway, with mirrored fixtures, ostrich feathers and leopard print features. While Wintour\u2019s shopgirl life was short-lived, Big Biba\u2019s staff were a vital component of the experience remembered Thomas. \u201cThey loved working there, it was their club,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if a (customer) bought a Biba poster and stuck it on her wall, she felt part of the club. It was the theater of retail really.\u201d It was an unmitigated success. When the store opened its legendary roof gardens in 1974, they were ushered in by a party described in the British press as \u201clike walking into a film set of rather jolly moral depravity.\u201d Shoppers from all over the country, and even internationally, convened at the store to buy into the zeitgeist. According to Hulanicki, during its two-year run, Big Biba was the number two tourist attraction in the British capital after the Tower of London, with Buckingham Palace being number three. But Biba\u2019s success was short-lived. In 1969, the independent company sold a majority of its shares to another British fashion retailer Dorothy Perkins which, in August 1973 (a month before Big Biba opened), was then bought by a property development company called British Land. The high cost of keeping the store open and the faltering British economy of the mid-70s meant the new owners closed the store\u2019s third and fourth floors in March 1975, and the rest of the store followed that September against the backdrop of a nationwide property slump. Six decades on however, Biba\u2019s legacy outlasts its footprint on the high street. Its low-cost yet well-made clothing is still coveted today, with heirloom designs sometimes retailing for hundreds of dollars. As Pel noted, \u201ctoday Biba clothes stand as a lesson to both consumers and retailers that inexpensive fashion does not have to be disposable.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/style/big-biba-london-1960s-store-history/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}

The huia was last officially spotted in the early 20th century and its feathers have previously sold for up to $8,400 NZD (about $5,100), according to Webb\u2019s Auction House. The huia bird feather, which was expected to sell for up to $3,000 NZD ($1,830), smashed the estimate on Monday to become the world\u2019s most expensive feather ever sold, Webb\u2019s Auction House said. \u201cThis rare huia feather is a beautiful example of Aotearoa\u2019s natural history and reminds us of the fragility of our ecosystem,\u201d\u00a0Leah Morris, head of decorative arts at the Auckland-based auction house, said in a statement. \u2018Lethal popularity\u2019 A member of the wattle-bird family, the huia was prized by many people - ultimately proving fatal for the species. For Maori, the bird\u2019s feathers were a mark of high status and the distinctive, white-tipped plumage were used for ceremonial headdresses. Only those of chiefly rank were permitted to wear huia feathers in their hair or whole skins in their ears, \ufeffaccording to the Museum of New Zealand. The feathers were often traded for other valuable goods or given as gifts to demonstrate friendship and respect, the auction house said. European New Zealanders also came to see the huia as a symbol of prestige. They used the animal\u2019s feathers for fashion accessories and stuffed huia were mounted as decoration in wealthy homes, according to the museum. The museum explains that Maori\u00a0and European\u00a0hunters killed the bird in \u201cgreat numbers\u201d during the 19th century, selling the skin to collectors and fashion merchants. The huia\u2019s \u201clethal popularity\u201d reportedly grew even more when the\u00a0Duke and Duchess of York were photographed\u00a0wearing feathers in their hats during a trip to New Zealand in 1901. \u201cPeople kind of had a frenzy and decided that everyone wanted a huia feather,\u201d said Morris of the event. Attempts made by scientists in the early 1900s to conserve the remaining huia failed. A government plan to ship the birds to offshore islands resulted in those who collected the birds to sell them as dead specimens, according to the museum, adding It was more \u201cprofitable\u201d than keeping them alive. The auction house said that all prospective buyers were required to provide a permit from New Zealand\u2019s Ministry for Culture and Heritage in advance of Monday\u2019s sale. As an object of national importance, the feather could only be purchased by registered collectors and cannot leave the country without permission from the ministry.

{"id": "2024_05_13_style_upcycled-clothes-fashion-brands-lawsuits", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 A little over a year ago, NFL player Travis Kelce stepped out in a flamboyant silk shirt emblazoned with two barrel-chest-sized pink flamingos and trimmed across the bottom with a giant Chanel logo. The design was upcycled from vintage Chanel scarves by stylist Logan Horne, whose brand, J. Logan Home, specializes in refashioning heritage luxury accessories. His pieces, which retail at close to $3,000 each, have also been worn by the musicians Dua Lipa and 2 Chainz and are sold at stores including Farfetch, Kith and The Webster. They\u2019ve also caught the attention of the French luxury giant\u2019s legal department. In February, lawyers acting for Chanel sent Horne a cease and desist letter, demanding his label stop selling products bearing its logo and other brand signifiers. It\u2019s the latest in a flurry of cases that have turned upcycling into an emerging legal battle ground, pitting a practice that\u2019s been pitched as key to improving the industry\u2019s sustainability credentials against the established bounds of trademark protection. \u201cWe really have these two values that point in different directions,\u201d said Fashion Law Institute founder Susan Scafidi. \u201c(Upcycling) is absolutely risky, despite the fact that it is trending and ethical.\u201d Why is upcycling controversial? Chanel\u2019s objection to J. Logan Home\u2019s designs isn\u2019t exactly a bolt from the blue. Major luxury players have historically been wary of the secondary market, concerned it could damage their carefully controlled hold on brand distribution and image, cannibalize sales and encourage counterfeiting. It\u2019s a tension that has played out prominently over the last decade thanks to the rapid rise of online resale platforms. Though some brands have begun to tentatively embrace the space, others have remained cautious. Chanel, in particular, has pursued high-profile cases against re-commerce players it argues are using its brand without permission and selling fakes. (The brand scored a major win earlier this year, when a New York court awarded it $4 million in damages in its suit against the resale business What Goes Around Comes Around. A separate legal dispute with The RealReal is ongoing.) Smaller-scale upcycling has attracted less attention so far. But the practice has become more widespread, driven in part by demand for logo-heavy streetwear, greater access to vintage products and deadstock fabrics and a growing desire among young designers to operate sustainably. That\u2019s given rise to an increasing number of trademark and copyright infringement complaints targeting upcyclers from brands including Louis Vuitton and Levi\u2019s, as well as Chanel. In 2022, Louis Vuitton secured a $603,000 pay out and permanent injunction in a Texas case against a business selling refashioned Vuitton products. Last year, Levi\u2019s brought a complaint against French label Coperni, alleging it was using pocket stitching and fabric tabs confusingly similar to the famed denim label. The sale of such products, alongside items that had actually been upcycled from Levi\u2019s jeans without authorization, created additional risk of consumer confusion, the company argued. Both brands declined to comment when reached by Business of Fashion. Does upcycling infringe on brands\u2019 trademarks? The disputes reflect legitimate trademark and copyright concerns, but they also raise questions over how far these protections should stretch when they conflict with broader sustainability goals, according to legal experts. \u201cIt is a grey area within the law,\u201d said Scafidi. \u201cBrands absolutely have a legal leg to stand on. The question is how well-clad it is.\u201d In general terms, once a brand has sold an item, it becomes fair game to be resold or redistributed by third parties. But this principle, known as the first-sale doctrine or trademark exhaustion, may not apply if an item has been reworked or embellished, lawyers said. Upcyclers can take precautions, like avoiding the prominent use of logos, or providing consumers with clear disclosures that reworked products are not authorized or affiliated with the brands they reference (an approach J. Logan Home adopted). But these steps still may not be sufficient to counter arguments of copyright or trademark infringement, according to lawyers. And while the legal frameworks protecting companies\u2019 intellectual property are well established, whether the sustainability benefits of upcycling should be weighed against these hasn\u2019t really been tested. \u201cIf we want to move from a linear to a circular economy, we need to upcycle,\u201d said Irene Calboli, a professor of law at Texas A&M University. \u201cThe fact that intellectual property law gets in the way of those who want to upcycle or recycle is just wrong.\u201d Chanel said it is paying close attention to sustainability matters, pointing to its work with L\u2019Atelier des Mati\u00e8res, which recycles unsold items and deadstock from luxury and premium brands. \u201c(Upcycling is) a positive trend that we continue to explore, and we have always been conscious of the need to strike a balance between protecting the rights of our brand and the rights of others to create and trade freely,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cHowever, the use of elements stamped with the Chanel logo is sometimes simply an unauthorized misappropriation of our trademarks\u2026 in such cases, we take the action we deem appropriate to protect our rights.\u201d The wider legal crackdown hasn\u2019t only targeted brands making prominent use of logos either. Before she became a celebrated New York designer, Batsheva Hay worked as a copyright lawyer. So it was a shock when she found herself on the receiving end of a cease and desist letter from a large commercial brand over a short run of dresses made from deadstock fabric sourced from India. Though it bore no obvious logo, as it turned out, the print she used had been made for a bigger player who didn\u2019t want to see it reproduced elsewhere. \u201cI was really humiliated and horrified because I thought it was some cool vintage fruit print and it turned out to be some kind of junky commercial print,\u201d said Hay. Rather than take on the time and expense of fighting the case, she just took the remaining three dresses she hadn\u2019t yet sold off her site. What does this mean for the future of upcycling? Horne says he can\u2019t afford to fight Chanel, which has threatened to seek statutory damages of $2 million per mark, disgorgement of all profits and payment of its attorney\u2019s fees if he doesn\u2019t stop selling products carrying the company\u2019s branding, according to a copy of the letter reviewed by Business of Fashion. Instead, he said he\u2019s looking at to pivot his brand while continuing to find creative ways to address the industry\u2019s issues with waste and over-production. The dream would be an opportunity to officially collaborate with an established label on an upcycled collection. \u201cAs much as I believe in my mission\u2026 I\u2019m not trying to go bankrupt going to battle with Chanel,\u201d he said. Industry watchers say the current flurry of cases reflect a broader adjustment to emerging new models. Some big brands, like Prada, Gucci and indeed Levi\u2019s, have already dabbled with upcycling collections and programs of their own. Anna Foster, who runs the refashioned brand E.L.V. Denim, has partnered with companies including Gabriela Hearst and The Outnet to help upcycle excess inventory. These days, she says she\u2019s having about a conversation a week with brands interested in exploring collaboration, but the industry moves slowly. Meanwhile, politics may be moving at a faster speed, creating different challenges for brands. Both consumers and policy makers are increasingly aware of the huge levels of waste generated by the fashion industry, with new regulations that would make brands more responsible for dealing with old clothes and excess inventory in the pipeline in both Europe and the US. \u201cWe really are at an inflection point where we might have a result in court that is different from the result in the court of social media,\u201d said Scafidi. \u201cIt\u2019s that tension that really needs to be resolved.\u201d This article was originally published by\u00a0The Business of Fashion, an editorial partner of CNN Style.

{"id": "2024_05_15_style_priscilla-queen-of-the-desert-costumes", "text": "Sydney, 1994. A dimly-lit bar, wrapped in tinsel curtains and the fragmented, twirling light from a disco ball. Tick Belrose (played by Hugo Weaving) is on stage lip syncing as his drag persona Mitzi Del Bra; clad in a silver sequin dress with matching gloves and a bouffant blonde wig. This is the opening scene from \u201cThe Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert\u201d, which first screened at Cannes Film Festival 30 years ago this month. \u201cI made that dress for myself,\u201d Tim Chappel, one of the movie\u2019s costume designers, told CNN. \u201cThe weekend before, I\u2019d gone to the Miss Teen USA beauty pageant as Miss Silicon Valley, because (the dress) had joke plastic boobs inside. Stephan (Elliott, the film\u2019s writer and director) was really on my case because I wanted to do lots of obscure stuff (to costume the film\u00a0), and he wanted (the principal characters in drag) \u00a0to look like ladies. So I said we can make him look like a lady and take the piss at the same time, because the boobs are clearly from a party shop. And I\u2019d already made it, so it was cheap!\u201d In the film, Tick scoops up his freshly widowed friend Bernadette Bassenger (played by Terence Stamp) and flamboyant, fellow drag queen Adam Whitley/ Felicia Jollygoodfellow (actor Guy Pearce) and goes west \u2014 both musically and literally \u2014 for a road trip across the Outback in their affectionately-christened bus: Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. \u201cWe were just having a laugh!\u201d Chappel said, recalling the film\u2019s production. Sydney 30 years ago was at a unique point in time and culture; not yet tethered to the rest of the world via the internet, the somewhat isolated drag scene was able to cultivate its own sprawling visual language for storytelling and sexual politics, beyond the more recognizable female impersonation that Elliott might have initially pushed for. \u201cIt was my first opportunity to really express myself as a designer, and I wasn\u2019t going to let anybody stand in my way,\u201d Chappel said. \u201cI just really wanted to make (the film\u2019s wardrobe) unique and interesting.\u201d Serving looks, on a budget Film critic Susan Barber, despite calling out the problematic handling of female and non-white characters, dubbed \u201cPriscilla\u201d the \u201cdarling\u201d of the Cannes Film Festival after it premiered there in 1994. The film quickly drew attention for its costuming in particular, winning Chappel and fellow designer Lizzy Gardiner an Oscar in 1995. Among many iconic looks is the flip-flop (or \u2018thong,\u2019 if you\u2019re Australian) dress. It was made from shoes Chappel bought for $15 in Target using his mother\u2019s staff discount \u2014 \u201cwhich was good,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause that was about three quarters of our budget.\u201d Their mandated thriftiness meant that several costumes, \u201cmade with hot glue, chicken wire and duct tape\u201d, fell apart not long after the cameras stopped rolling. The flip-flop dress survived, though \u2014 that was made with cable ties, as well as duct tape. Two years passed between Chappel first joining the project and its (limited) funding being secured. The time allowed him to play with and re-do ideas, evolving initial plans into their extravagant final form. In one scene, for instance, Tick, Adam and Bernadette put on a fireside performance of Gloria Gaynor\u2019s \u201cI Will Survive\u201d for a group of First Nations people. Rather than mimic Gaynor\u2019s hairstyle directly, however, Chappel spent his elongated preparation time adding an increasing bouquet of flowers to the trio\u2019s headpieces, until eventually there was no hair left at all. \u201cI think that\u2019s definitely one of the most iconic looks,\u201d drag artist and costumer Philmah Bocks told CNN. Bocks has been designing costumes for 30 years, having broken into the drag scene around the same time \u201cPriscilla\u201d was hitting screens. \u201cThe thong dress is a very iconic piece too, because I think that\u2019s very (stereotypically) Australian. And of course the big finale look, with the emus on top of their heads. That\u2019s the beauty of \u2018Priscilla\u2019: they\u2019ve really captured a moment in Australian time and used Australian culture and flora and fauna to create these wonderful pieces.\u201d \u201cThe art of drag costuming is the ability to turn drab into fab,\u201d she continued. \u201c\u2019Priscilla\u2019 showed us a lot of that, because a lot of that type of design work was happening in and around Sydney in the early \u201890s. There was this sort of explosion of drag costuming that went beyond couture. Of course, queens were also on a budget. You couldn\u2019t always afford hundreds or even thousands of dollars to create the most beautiful pieces, but you could kind of get there with stuff we found in a dumpster! It\u2019s what you do with it that makes the difference\u2026 I\u2019ve been replicating (Chappel\u2019s) costumes for 30 years, so I\u2019ve got a lot to thank him for!\u201d Bocks is known for her foam, or \u2018Phoam\u2019, wigs, a look also popularized in \u201cPriscilla\u201d which she\u2019s made for London\u2019s hit musical \u201cPriscilla the Party!\u201d as well as for Katy Perry on an episode of \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d. These creations also follow the \u201cdrab to fab\u201d ethos: they\u2019re made from materials bought at the hardware store. \u201cI remember buying this product from the hardware store knowing full well that it was going on Katy Perry\u2019s head, and that made me laugh a little,\u201d Bocks said. \u201cOf course, by the time I\u2019d finished with it, it looked nothing like it had originally.\u201d Spirit of Ecstasy Perhaps more so than any other costume, the enduring image from \u201cPriscilla\u201d is Adam/ Felicia\u2019s opera performance atop the moving bus, decked out in hundreds of meters of flowing silver lam\u00e9. Its inspiration came from the Rolls Royce \u201cSpirit of Ecstasy\u201d bonnet ornament, though once again the final product went far beyond the script\u2019s guidance. Felicia\u2019s windswept aria comes after their bus is scrawled in homophobic graffiti \u2014 a reflection of the community\u2019s resilience against hate and disaster in real life. \u201cPriscilla\u201d received her standing ovation at Cannes seven months before Australia decriminalized homosexuality at federal level; three years before Tasmania would become the final state to pass similar legislation, and at a time when the AIDS crisis was still at large. Despite that, Chappel remembers the film as coming at a positive turning point: new HIV treatments were being trialed, replacing toxic doses of the AZT drug that had previously been offered. \u201cAll of a sudden there was hope. Out of the blue,\u201d he said. \u201c\u201cPriscilla\u201d, I think, captures that energy of everybody coming back to life.\u201d Stephan Elliott has recently announced that a sequel to \u201cPriscilla\u201d is in the works, with Chappel on board. The newest addition to the empire will join \u201cPriscilla\u2019s\u201d musical adaptation, which has toured the globe in Chappel\u2019s costumes since 2006. The film\u2019s legacy can also be seen in Australia\u2019s drag scene today and, since 2021, has been broadcast to new audiences via contestants on \u201cRupaul\u2019s Drag Race Down Under\u201d. \u201cIf I get run over by a bus tomorrow,\u201d Chappel said, \u201cthe last little thought that goes through my head \u2013 besides \u2018ouch\u2019 \u2013 is going to be \u2018I\u2019ve left an impression, that\u2019s cool\u2019.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/style/priscilla-queen-of-the-desert-costumes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}

And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_04_04_style_taipei-101-earthquake-design-intl-hnk", "text": "The deadly 7.4 magnitude earthquake that hit Taiwan on Wednesday and left at least 9 people dead, also damaged 770 buildings, according to the latest estimates from the island\u2019s National Fire Agency (NFA). In the capital Taipei, just 80 miles away from the epicenter, buildings also shook violently during what was Taiwan\u2019s strongest earthquake in 25 years. But in a triumph of modern engineering, the soaring Taipei 101, once the world\u2019s tallest skyscraper, emerged from the island\u2019s latest seismic event undamaged. Footage from the quake appears to show the 1,667-foot-tall tower slightly swaying, its structural flexibility helping to counter the powerful motion of the quake. This movement perfectly demonstrated how the skyscraper\u2019s single most important defense against earthquakes is the very material it is constructed from: reinforced concrete. Combining concrete\u2019s compressive strength with steel\u2019s tensile strength, the material makes the building flexible enough to sway, yet rigid enough to resist high winds and the typhoons that frequently hit Taiwan. (The principle that buildings can endure seismic forces by moving with them, rather than against them, has underpinned traditional architecture in earthquake-prone East Asian countries for centuries, from Japanese pagodas to Chinese palaces.) High within the tower,\u00a0however, another technological innovation helps protect the 101-story skyscraper \u2014 a huge orb-like device known as a tuned mass damper. Giant counterweight Suspended from 92 thick cables between the 87th and 92nd floors, the golden steel sphere can move about 5 feet in any direction. As a result, it acts like a pendulum that counteracts (or \u201cdampens\u201d) swaying motions. \u201cIt\u2019s essentially a very large counterweight,\u201d explained Stefan Al, author of \u201cSupertall: How the World\u2019s Tallest Buildings Are Reshaping Our Cities and Our Lives,\u201d in a phone interview. \u201cIn the case of Taipei 101, it\u2019s 660 tons. That seems really heavy, but if you compare it to the overall weight of the building, it\u2019s just a fraction. \u201cWhen a building starts to shake, (the tuned mass damper) will move in the opposite direction. In the case of Taipei 101, it\u2019s suspended\u2026 so it will lag behind as the tower sways and will absorb the kinetic energy by moving in the opposite direction,\u201d Al said, explaining that hydraulic cylinders between the ball and the building convert this energy into heat, which is then dispersed. Tuned mass dampers are used in skyscrapers around the world, including the \u201csuper-skinny\u201d Steinway Tower in New York and Dubai\u2019s sail-shaped Burj al-Arab, which has 11 of them. The device crucially protects against the violent motion caused by \u201charmonic vibration,\u201d which can cause structural failure during an earthquake, Al said. \u201c(That\u2019s) when buildings start to vibrate at their own resonance,\u201d he said, comparing the phenomenon to a tuning fork. \u201cThis can lead to a collapse, (as the building) will start shaking faster and faster and faster.\u201d Tuned mass dampers, which are also known as harmonic absorbers, are \u201ctuned\u201d to resonate at the same frequency as the building \u2014 but with wavelengths starting earlier or later, helping to dissipate the potentially catastrophic energy. The stability they provide can also reduce the uncomfortable \u2014 or even nauseating \u2014 effect swaying can have on a building\u2019s occupants in high winds. Structural support Designed by Taiwanese firm C.Y. Lee & Partners, Taipei 101 was the world\u2019s tallest building from 2004 until 2007, when it was surpassed by the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. An observation deck overlooking its groundbreaking tuned mass damper is now a popular visitor attraction, especially when it moves during strong winds. The giant sphere is not, however, the only design feature helping stabilize the tower, which stands close to a major fault line. For one, the skyscraper sits on exceptionally deep foundations \u2014 namely 380 reinforced concrete and steel piles drilled down into the bedrock below. Above them, the building\u2019s core is connected to a series of \u201cmega-columns,\u201d located around its perimeter, via enormous steel outrigger trusses. The high-rise complies with strict anti-seismic building codes that are as stringent as one might expect on an island located along the \u201cPacific Ring of Fire,\u201d which runs around the edge of the Pacific Ocean and causes massive seismic and volcanic activity from Indonesia to Chile. But while the design also underwent extensive digital modeling and \u201cshake table\u201d testing (in which scale models are tested on a device that replicates the movement of an earthquake), how a building like Taipei 101 would react to a stronger or closer seismic event remains, to an extent, theoretical. \u201cEven though we have computer simulations, there\u2019s still something about the physical that that we cannot really get from digital simulations,\u201d said Al, adding: \u201cDespite our technological advances, we are still testing (designs) in wind tunnels and shaker tables.\u201d This article has been updated to reflect the latest estimates on the number of buildings damaged.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/04/style/taipei-101-earthquake-design-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_style_bmw-art-car-julie-mehretu", "text": "Over the past 50 years, artists including Andy Warhol, Jeff Koons, Jenny Holzer and Robert Rauschenberg have been chosen by the luxury car company to use a BMW as their canvas, each adorning one of the famous BMW Art Cars in their signature style. Ethiopian American artist Julie Mehretu, known for her work in abstract painting, was chosen last year to create the company\u2019s newest \u2018Art Car.\u2019 Her artwork, painted on a BMW M Hybrid V8, was recently unveiled at the Pompidou Center in Paris and will be on the track at the 24 Hours of Le Mans race next month. The BMW M Hybrid V8, a plug-in hybrid, is a track-only racing car created to compete in the international endurance racing circuit. Designed and engineered in collaboration with the Italian race car manufacturer Dallara, it\u2019s low and wide with an enormous rear wing and a large vertical rudder. For the commission, which marks the 20th BMW Art Car, Mehretu chose to adapt one of her most famous works: The painting \u201cEverywhen,\u201d which is now in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. The painting \u2014 and the car \u2014 are covered in broad washes color cut through with broad black streaks and lines. \u201cIn the studio where I had the model of the BMW M Hybrid V8 I was just sitting in front of the painting and I thought: What would happen if this car seemed to go through that painting and becomes affected by it,\u201d Mehretu said in a statement. \u201cThe idea was to make a remix, a mash-up of the painting. I kept seeing that painting kind of dripping into the car.\u201d The first BMW Art Car was painted in 1975 by the American sculptor Alexander Calder after French racing driver Herv\u00e9 Poulain\u00a0brought the idea to BMW. Poulain drove the Calder-painted BMW 3.0 CSL at Le Mans that year. In 1977, Roy Lichtenstein covered a BMW 320 Group 5 in the graphic stripes and dots he was renowned for; Warhol painted a BMW M1 in 1979 with textured, pastel brushstrokes. The first woman to take on a BMW Art Car was South African artist Esther Mahlangu, who in 1991 painted a 525i sedan. In 1996, Holzer covered a BMW Le Mans race car in the words \u201cProtect Me From What I Want,\u201d among other provocative phrases. Mehretu\u2019s practice frequently draws inspiration from architecture and busy urban settings, featuring intricate juxtapositions of lines and shapes \u2014 inspired by technical drawings and building plans \u2014 and, sometimes, splashes of color or deep darkness. Her work has also addressed themes such as migration, colonialization and globalization. Critics often highlight the sense of humanity apparent in her innovative, abstract works. There\u2019s movement and complex emotion. Mehretu is best known for large-scale pieces, like an eighty-foot-long mural she created for the lobby of the Goldman Sachs building in Manhattan. It\u2019s busy and bright with colored shapes overlaying dark straight lines; the red, yellow, blue and green forms appear to be actively shooting out across the huge wall. Other works, like \u201cMogama (A Painting in 4 Parts),\u201d are grayer and more pensive but retain a soft, rippling sense of motion. She is represented by the Marian Goodman Gallery, which describes her body of work on its website as \u201ca dynamic visual articulation of contemporary experience, a depiction of social behavior and the psychogeography of space.\u201d \u201cMehretu\u2019s practice in painting, drawing and printmaking equally assert the role of art to provoke thought and reflection, and express the contemporary condition of the individual and society,\u201d the gallery added. Mehretu was born in 1970 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia to an Ethiopian father and an American mother. Seven years later, the family moved to the United States to escape a brutal civil war then-raging in the country. In 1997, she earned a Masters of Fine Arts from the Rhode Island School of Design; she is currently based in New York. She has received widespread acclaim for her work, and prestigious awards including a MacArthur Fellowship in 2005 and, in 2015, a US Department of State Medal of Arts Award. She was unanimously selected for this project by a jury of prominent gallery and museum directors. Madeleine Grynsztejn, Pritzker Director at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago and a member of that jury, described Mehretu as the \u201cperfect artist\u201d to take on the BMW Art Car in a statement released last June announcing her selection. \u201cFor years, Julie has painted speed and for a long time worked very successfully at scale,\u201d Grynsztejn said. \u201cTo merge her work with the shape and form of a speeding vehicle is really an alignment of perfection.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/style/bmw-art-car-julie-mehretu/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "style_article_reuben-wu-landscape-photography", "text": "The first time Reuben Wu saw the warm sandstone hues and vast, open skies of the American West, he was watching the landscapes pass him by from the window of a tour bus.  The British visual artist, now based in Chicago, has become known for his sublime imagery of remote landscapes using drone lighting, enhancing craggy peaks with halos, or writing glyphs in the sky like signals from a supernatural entity. But for a long time, art was just a passion project while he focused on a music career as one of the four members of the synth-pop band Ladytron. \u201c(Photography) started as an all-consuming hobby,\u201d he explained in a phone interview. But when Ladytron took a break in 2011 after five studio albums (they released a self-titled sixth album in 2019, and the seventh, \u201cTime\u2019s Arrow,\u201d this month), he began a new career from scratch. \u201cWhile the others did their own solo projects, making their own music and releasing their own albums, this was my solo project.\u201d Wu\u2019s imagery takes a classic photographer\u2019s combination \u2014 light and landscape \u2014 and marries the two in transformative ways. He often begins with dusky evening light or the ink-black shadows of night, then strategically illuminates portions of the scene with custom-built consumer drones. In one image, a bright horizontal line hangs over a glacier in the Peruvian Andes, revealing the brilliance of the ice against a dark sky. In a different motion piece, Wu simulated an electrical storm in Goblin Valley, Utah, but with perfectly straight strikes of light rather than the jagged bursts of lightning.  The artist\u2019s 2018 photo book \u201cLux Noctis\u201d is in the collections of the Guggenheim and Museum of Modern Art, in New York, and he has shot commercial work for Apple, Audi and Google as well as the DJ and music producer Zedd. Last summer, Wu revealed a colossal project for National Geographic: a cover story and timelapse multimedia piece about Stonehenge, which featured the enigmatic monument lit by his custom drones. In November, one of his NFTs, a 4K video loop titled \u201cAn Irresistible Force,\u201d outperformed its high estimate by over 25% during an auction at Sotheby\u2019s Hong Kong, selling at 441,000 HKD (about $56,500). \u201cI couldn\u2019t have dreamed of where I am now,\u201d Wu said. \u201cI just wanted to be able to make a living from doing art and from doing photography.\u201d  Alien inspiration Wu has always been drawn to wild, remote places where he could find solitude. His parents immigrated from Hong Kong to the UK before he was born, and he grew up an introverted child in Liverpool, he said, who didn\u2019t quite click with school. He was fascinated with science-fiction films that mix the alien with the everyday, such as Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind,\u201d which featured Wyoming\u2019s Devils Tower as a site for extraterrestrial contact. (Unfamiliar with American topography, he initially thought the butte, a national monument, was a fictional geological entity, he explained with a laugh).  The film\u2019s visuals of remote desert scenes mixed with eerie lights have been a formative inspiration in his own work. \u201c(It\u2019s) cemented into my brain, the idea of these seemingly impossible lights moving through the sky, kind of like search lights on very ordinary (American) landscapes,\u201d he said.  He embarked on his first cross-country photography trip across the US in 2013, around a decade after getting a taste on the road with Ladytron. The resulting series featured vivid depictions of the Grand Canyon and South Dakota Badlands, as well as a time-lapse image of Devils Tower at night among star trails.  Two years later, Wu discovered the effect that drone lighting could have on the natural world while working on an outdoor automotive shoot. \u201cI flew the drone up above some cliffs, and I was absolutely fascinated by the effect it had on the actual landscape,\u201d he explained. It made the cliffs glow, reaching areas that were otherwise impossible to light artificially.  Wu rigs lights on drones to suit his needs on any given shoot or project. The first iteration, he said, which he used when the technology was still nascent, was a \u201cmassive\u201d eight-rotor drone outfitted with homemade lights that only had about eight minutes of flight time. The next used a 3D-printed bracket with an LED hot light, but still only gave him an additional two minutes in the air. The tech he uses now gives him a bit more breathing room, with a half hour to fly out, capture images and return to him, but he\u2019s had to learn to work within the bounds of each set-up. \u201cI\u2019m a lot less anxious now, because I\u2019ve crashed a number of drones,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in the end, they\u2019re just tools.\u201d  Experimental series After developing series of still images such as \u201cLux Noctis\u201d and \u201cAeroglyphs,\u201d which experiment with ghostly lighting and geometric shapes in the skies, Wu found himself wanting to incorporate motion and sound into his work because of his own background in music. He began creating 15-second video loops from his images, showing light beams forming patterns or the moon arcing across the sky, to the beats of atmospheric electronic music that he produced. \u201cThese (works) were very much experimental and had no end goal \u2014 they were just things that I did for love out of love,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t license them, I couldn\u2019t print them\u2026 and so they were just there, stacking likes on my Instagram.\u201d But in January 2021, Wu found a way to make them a more substantial part of his career when he was introduced to NFT art. He minted his first \u201cnon-fungible token\u201d  on the marketplace Foundation two months later \u2014 an \u201caeroglyph\u201d of bright lines forming a rectangle above a beachside cliff. It sold for 30 ETH ($45,000), a portion of which he donated to the National Parks Conservation Association and the AAPI Community Fund. Later that year, the web3 arts organization Obscura commissioned him to produce a new set of images titled \u201cAeroglyph Variations,\u201d which took him into the New Mexico badlands for a 20-hour shoot that resulted in 55 images of the same setting, each with different lighting conditions and patterns. Wu has also experimented with presenting the work in different ways, from animations, to AR experiences, to projection mapping moving images onto physical prints. \u201cIt\u2019s very much a hybrid medium, and so I\u2019d like to expand that horizon even more, and think about the end goal for my work,\u201d he said. \u201cAm I creating a nice piece of art for people to look at and appreciate, or am I creating an experience for people to share?\u201d Wu is leaning towards the latter as he continues to experiment with the form his work takes, but no matter the medium, his vision of and approach to the natural world remains consistent. \u201cA lot of people always say that my work is otherworldly \u2014 that is the first word that people think of when they think about my work,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not trying to create an alien-looking image; I\u2019m trying to show that this is our planet. And there are so many new ways that are available to see it that can renew your perspective.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/article/reuben-wu-landscape-photography/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}

Alejandra Rodriguez made headlines across the world in April when she was crowned Miss Buenos Aires, becoming the first sexagenarian to win a contest organized by the Miss Universe franchise. While she was unable to repeat that triumph on Saturday to become Miss Argentina and earn the right to represent her country in the Miss Universe pageant, she did win the \u201cbest face\u201d category and celebrated her breakthrough as marking the beginnings of a shift in how beauty is perceived. \u201cThis is the first step of a change that is coming,\u201d Rodriguez, an attorney and journalist by profession, told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol after the contest. \u201cI hope this (my participating) marks a before and after. I think exterior beauty is always the main focus, I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s wrong to select a beautiful woman, but maybe the concept of beauty needs to expand,\u201d she said. Rodriguez\u2019s participation was only made possible after the Miss Universe organization changed its rules related to age. Until 2023, contestants had to be between the ages of 18 and 28 as of January 1 of the year in which they competed. As of 2024, there is no upper age limit. \u201cIt was a change that is positive, I think it is little by little, like all changes,\u201d she said, adding she was thankful to have \u201cthe opportunity to be the first.\u201d Ending the age limit was just one of a series of rule changes the pageant introduced in 2023 in an effort to modernize. For the first time in its more than 70-year history, the franchise also greenlit the participation of women who are married or divorced, and who have given birth or are pregnant. \u201cThere was also a 40-year-old woman who participated, another who is 37. It\u2019s like the limits are already expanding,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cThere were women who are mothers, things that were unthinkable before in Miss Universe.\u201d Rodriguez said that even though she fell short of the honor of representing her country, stereotypes related to beauty, age, shape and weight were slowly changing.

{"id": "2024_05_17_style_india-elections-bollywood-modi-bjp-influence-intl-hnk-dst", "text": "For nearly a century, Bollywood has held a mirror to Indian society, the plotlines of the world\u2019s most prolific movie industry reflecting the changing tides of a vast, developing nation. India\u2019s multibillion-dollar movie industry produces around 1,500 to 2,000 films per year in over 20 languages \u2013 more than any other country. And most of these are Hindi films, meaning Bollywood holds an outsized influence on the country\u2019s culture, identity and economy. And while the industry is perhaps most famous for its lavish musical productions, many films also tackle the political, religious and social issues of any given era. But where Hindi cinema once reflected certain secular, democratic values championed by India\u2019s founding fathers, many critics say the industry has veered toward the right over the past decade \u2013 coinciding with the populist rule of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Alarmed liberals and some industry insiders point to a string of recent blockbusters that they say perpetuate anti-Muslim stereotypes and sideline opposition views. While they only represent a fraction of movies produced each year, they receive outsized publicity and sometimes government support \u2013 and critics worry they serve as propaganda tools for the BJP as it aims to win a third straight term in ongoing nationwide elections. Observers and insiders say the change is profound \u2013 as if Hollywood was increasingly pandering to the Republican party\u2019s most right-wing sensibilities. These types of films swap the common romantic heartthrob archetype with heroes that champion Modi\u2019s Hindu-first policies, and villains are almost always Muslims who threaten the country\u2019s majority-Hindu population. Even movies without a religious lean are being used to amplify the BJP\u2019s domestic policies, critics say. \u201cThere are a lot of these releases coming out now,\u201d said award-winning director Raja Sen in a video interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not the kind of thing that you should be allowed to do in an election year.\u201d With voting underway in the world\u2019s most populous nation, a significant portion of its more than 200 million Muslims have voiced fear over Modi\u2019s widely expected victory. They cite sweeping BJP changes to legislation that human rights groups say unfairly target followers of the minority faith, along with a rise in anti-Islamic rhetoric. While films echoing the ruling party\u2019s views are not produced or directly funded by the BJP, many of them are publicly endorsed by the government \u2013 some by Modi directly. Though divisive, the prime minister enjoys enormous support across the country thanks to his economic wins, overseas diplomacy and brand of Hindu nationalist populism. Modi\u2019s seal of approval can therefore boost a movie\u2019s audience and bring commercial success, experts say, all while pushing anti-Muslim narratives into the mainstream and deepening India\u2019s religious divide. \u201cI have seen firsthand this tidal change in popular Hindi cinema, of films not just toeing the government line, but also just becoming \u2026 more and more vile,\u201d said Tanul Thakur, a film critic and journalist based in Mumbai, the home of Bollywood, in a phone interview. \u201cThe degree to which we are seeing the infusion of politics in popular Hindi cinema, coupled with \u2026 this very blatant disregard for India\u2019s religious minorities, and any kind of multiplicity of narratives \u2026 has been very disconcerting.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Ministry of Culture, the BJP, and the regulatory Central Board of Film Certification for comment on the claims made by critics in this story. A BJP national spokesperson has previously told CNN the\u00a0party is not prejudiced against Muslims, and the community has benefited from Modi\u2019s leadership, saying: \u201cIndia\u2019s constitution protects the Indian democracy.\u201d Changing climates Every expert who spoke with CNN agreed that the production of pro-government and anti-Muslim movies has accelerated during Modi\u2019s time in office. They pointed to a number of recent releases that pushed that agenda \u2013 including this year\u2019s \u201cSwatantrya Veer Savarkar,\u201d a biopic of a leading figure in India\u2019s Hindu-nationalist movement, and the upcoming \u201cJNU,\u201d which critics worry will demonize the titular university known for left-wing student activism. Two of the most famous examples are \u201cThe Kashmir Files\u201d of 2022 and \u201cThe Kerala Story\u201d of 2023, which were both criticized for vilifying Muslims, perpetuating negative stereotypes, worsening religious tensions and distorting historical facts. Both were also massive box office successes \u2013 \u201cThe Kashmir Files\u201d raked in over $30 million on a $3 million budget \u2013 in part because they received enthusiastic government praise. While the BJP didn\u2019t fund the productions, prominent party politicians, including Modi, publicly endorsed the two movies, and some BJP-ruled states waived tax on tickets for both. Other states gave police officers and government workers time off to watch \u201cThe Kashmir Files.\u201d \u201cThe Kashmir Files\u201d was based on the mass exodus of Kashmiri Pandits \u2013 members of Hinduism\u2019s highest caste, the Brahmin, or \u201cpriestly class\u201d \u2013 from the restive region as they fled violent Islamist militants in the 1990s. It was well received in many quarters with praise for the actors\u2019 performances, especially from some Kashmiri Hindus who claimed the film shed a light on a neglected period of their history. Its director, Vivek Agnihotri, has repeatedly rejected criticism of the movie, telling CNN in 2022: \u201cThe film is only against terrorism. I have not criticized Muslims.\u201d Sudipto Sen, director of \u201cThe Kerala Story,\u201d has similarly denied that his film propagated Islamophobia, telling local media \u201cIt has nothing to do with any religion.\u201d Then there\u2019s the recently released \u201cArticle 370,\u201d also endorsed by Modi, named after the Indian government\u2019s controversial 2019 decision to remove the special autonomy of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state, Jammu and Kashmir.\u00a0Some media and rights groups slammed the government\u2019s heavy-handed crackdown at the time, while critics of the film argued it distorted the facts and drove a government narrative that the move was essential. Critics say these types of movies stretch back years during Modi\u2019s tenure \u2013 with a similar spate of pro-government films that sprung up around the 2019 election season, including a glowing biopic of the prime minister himself which was ultimately held for release until after polls closed, due to concerns it would serve as political propaganda. Though nationalist movies rarely attract direct political backing, support from the government may also take the form of what is and is not shown in theaters. The country\u2019s strict national censor board can pull movies from cinemas or ban them from release, with reasons ranging from religious objections to accusations that plots are \u201cobscene\u201d or \u201cimmoral.\u201d The impact of Bollywood\u2019s transformation has been profound \u2013 with far-right Hindu nationalists attacking movies that offend their sensibilities, such as those critical of the government or depicting Hindu-Muslim unity. Experts say it has forced filmmakers to self-censor and streaming platforms to fall in line \u2013 with several high-profile instances in recent years of India\u2019s entertainment industry facing pressure campaigns from religious groups. They include Netflix\u2019s 2020 show \u201cA Suitable Boy,\u201d which depicts a young Hindu woman being kissed by a Muslim man at a Hindu temple, and Amazon\u2019s 2021 series \u201cTandav,\u201d which included depictions of some Hindu deities. Another example is this year\u2019s release of Netflix\u2019s \u201cAnnapoorani: the Goddess of Food,\u201d which follows a high-caste Hindu woman cooking and eating meat as she trains to become a chef. In all three instances, the filmmakers faced backlash from far-right Hindu nationalists and politicians who called for boycotts and filed police complaints against the streaming platforms and production companies. Netflix later removed \u201cAnnapoorani\u201d from its platform, saying it had been pulled \u201cat the request of the licensor.\u201d \u2018Growing intolerance\u2019 Objections to movie storylines on religious grounds date back as far as the colonial era, says Debashree Mukherjee, an associate professor at Columbia University\u2019s department of Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African studies. But what\u2019s happening now is different because it\u2019s not just individuals taking offense \u2013 rather, \u201cthe forces that are actually in power and in the demographic majority are crying wolf in order to completely silence any minority voices,\u201d she said in an email interview. Thakur and Sen both lamented the self-censorship that has ensued, saying there may be countless filmmakers and artists concerned about these issues who feel unable to speak out \u2013 which can come at a hefty cost. Movies are expensive to make, meaning there\u2019s little incentive for filmmakers to produce controversial movies that could be pulled from streaming platforms or censored by authorities \u2013 especially for independent creators without much funding, says Darab Farooqui, a screenwriter based in Jaipur and Mumbai. Under Indian law, insulting \u201creligious feelings\u201d is punishable by up to three years in prison and/or a fine. And, Farooqui says, there\u2019s the personal toll of being targeted by the far-right. \u201cThere are going to be articles in right-wing publications, there are going to be character assassinations,\u201d he told CNN in a phone interview. \u201cImagine your son or your daughter is now in college, and she\u2019s being told by her friends, \u2018What is wrong with your father, your father has turned anti-national\u2019 \u2026 you don\u2019t want to put your kids through that.\u201d Even Bollywood\u2019s biggest names aren\u2019t spared. Muslim superstar Aamir Khan was dropped from two brand ambassadorships, including the government\u2019s own tourism body, after speaking out about \u201cgrowing intolerance\u201d in 2015, according to local media reports. Now, within India\u2019s arts and film community, \u201ceven those people who used to talk a lot very openly \u2026 a lot of them have gone quiet now,\u201d Farooqui says. CNN reached out to several people from the film industry for this story, some of whom declined to be interviewed due to sensitivities around the topic. A more progressive time Bollywood wasn\u2019t always this way. Many of its prominent early filmmakers were influenced by the country gaining independence from British rule in 1947 and the bloody partition that ensued \u2013 sending Muslims to the newly formed nation of Pakistan, while Hindus and Sikhs fled to India. The traumas of Partition and religious violence, as well as the secular values enshrined in India\u2019s constitution and championed by its first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, shone in early Bollywood movies \u2013 with a \u201cnew round of Hindu-Muslim brotherhood films\u201d in the 1950s, says Mukherjee, the associate professor at Columbia University. In that era, she adds, Bollywood was \u201ca very mixed scene with a cacophony of voices,\u201d including renowned directors like Yash Chopra. His films often depicted romantic and familial relationships between Hindus and Muslims, making \u201cdeeper comments against social and religious prejudice.\u201d That\u2019s not to say all early Bollywood films preached harmony; over the decades, there were patriotic films about India-Pakistan conflicts that cast Muslims or Pakistan as the villain, often reflecting Delhi\u2019s foreign policy stance at various times. Raja Sen, the director, argues the 9/11 attacks in the United States and the ensuing wave of Islamophobia in the West also seeped into Hindi films. It encouraged some Bollywood filmmakers to \u201c(lean) into the caricature of the Muslim villain,\u201d he says. The shift we\u2019re seeing now is a far cry from earlier decades when governments offered tax waivers for \u201csafe films that would tackle, say, the evils of caste system,\u201d says Thakur, the journalist, referring to India\u2019s 2,000-year-old social hierarchy imposed on people by birth that still exists in many aspects of life, despite being officially abolished in 1950. The films that used to receive government support \u201cspoke largely for the nation, films that spoke about something that we could all be unified about,\u201d Thakur adds. Avenues for dissent India\u2019s shift to the right has had a widespread impact on the creative arts, according to Sen. He points to drama schools clamping down on what students can watch or produce, and the detention of comedians for allegedly hurting religious sentiment. Journalists have also voiced alarm over the decline of press freedoms under Modi\u2019s government. \u201cOver the last three or four years, we started seeing \u2026 a crackdown in a lot of creative output,\u201d Sen says. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had a lot of arbitrary (censorship), but I think now is where it started really getting after specific examples (of), \u2018You will not be anti-government.\u2019\u201d With avenues for dissent shrinking within Bollywood, independent filmmakers are now looking instead to regional Indian cinema, filmed in local languages away from the industry\u2019s traditional center of Mumbai. These films are growing fast; outside Bollywood, earnings from the South Indian media and entertainment industry have nearly doubled year on year, according to a 2023 report by the Confederation of Indian Industry. And these regional sectors offer space for bolder stories, especially in states not ruled by the BJP. Tamil and Malayalam cinema \u2013 mainly based in the southern states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, neither of which is governed by the BJP \u2013 both \u201cdo a fairly good job\u201d of allowing plural, critical voices, says Farooqui. And it\u2019s \u201cbecause they have political protection \u2013 they have their governments there,\u201d he says. \u201cYou cannot have great art without political protection.\u201d But the prospect of another five-year term for Modi and the BJP has filled some filmmakers with pessimism about Bollywood\u2019s near-term future. \u201cSomething\u2019s definitely got to give,\u201d Sen says. \u201cI think we are at a point where, over the next couple of years, if this government does return this year, then the oppressiveness on creativity is going to just increase.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/style/india-elections-bollywood-modi-bjp-influence-intl-hnk-dst/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_style_and-just-like-that-carrie-bradshaw-fashion-lotw", "text": "Carrie Bradshaw, the lead character played by Sarah Jessica Parker in the 1998-2004 TV series \u201cSex and the City,\u201d has always been more of a fashion daredevil than a fashion darling. From the time she wore a floating belt fastened across her bare midriff (season 4 episode 15) to the cowboy hat, python-print bandeau and striped sarong (season 2, episode 17), Parker\u2019s on-screen persona has never shied away from making a bold style statement. Bradshaw\u2019s sartorial abandon has long been part of her quirky allure. The Instagram account, @everyoutfitonsatc, has provided a diligent digital archive of the character\u2019s best looks for its 746,000 followers. Many of the early SATC outfits documented are met with pure adoration by a throng of Carrie apologists ready to jump to her defense in the comments, even for the more visually challenging ensembles. \u201cThis is one of my favorite Carrie looks! Something only she could\u2019ve pulled off,\u201d wrote one fan under an image of Bradshaw in a clashing neon pink and green Betsy Johnson tulle dress \u2014 complete with abstract printed leggings. \u201cShe\u2019d look fabulous wearing anything.\u201d But since the launch of the series reboot \u201cAnd Just Like That\u2026\u201d in 2021, Bradshaw\u2019s wacky wardrobe has drawn more criticism than kudos. (HBO and Max, which airs \u201cAnd Just Like That\u2026,\u201d are also owned by CNN\u2019s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.) As filming for the show\u2019s third season continues around New York City, Bradshaw has so far been spotted in ensembles including wearing a sheer, rose-stuffed frock from the Irish designer Simone Rocha (pictured above), as well as a vintage color-blocked Ossie Clark dress and an oversize floppy Maryam Keyhani gingham sun hat. These looks have seemingly fallen flat with some viewers of the show. \u201cDefinitely too much,\u201d read one critique under @everyoutfitonsatc\u2019s post of Jessica Parker in the latter look. \u201cThis was not Carrie\u2019s style\u2026 This is trash,\u201d read another. (Commentary surrounding the Simone Rocha-designed look was somewhat kinder, however, with dedicated followers of Bradshaw\u2019s fashions showing appreciation for the nod to the character\u2019s love of florals \u2014 and a visible bra. So was the response to the first new look Jessica Parker was spotted in while filming in recent weeks: A pair of prissy vintage pastel separates from YSL and Ralph Lauren respectively.) The departure of Patricia Field, longtime stylist on \u201cSex and the City,\u201d has given some sartorially-minded viewers of \u201cAnd Just Like That\u2026\u201d a scapegoat for their grumblings. But Field plowed her own absurdist furrow when curating her characters\u2019 wardrobes (and beyond). \u201cFollowing fashion trends? It\u2019s a waste,\u201d she told The Guardian in February. \u201cTo me, fashion is a cousin of art. And like art, originality is what counts. When it starts to feel intimidating, it\u2019s time to change.\u201d It\u2019s an instinct that the show\u2019s current stylists, Molly Rogers and Danny Santiago, have honored with Bradshaw\u2019s melting pot of patterns and silhouettes \u2014 but one that has gone under appreciated. So has Bradshaw\u2019s style really changed, or have we? Are audiences less tolerant towards an off-beat dresser in her late 50s, when compared to one in her 30s? It seems like a ripe topic for the character\u2019s newspaper column, and one Jessica Parker has thoughts on too. \u201cThere\u2019s so much misogynist chatter in response to us that would never. Happen. About. A. Man,\u201d the actor told Vogue in 2021. \u201cEspecially on social media. Everyone has something to say.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/style/and-just-like-that-carrie-bradshaw-fashion-lotw/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_07_style_vintage-red-carpet-fashion", "text": "It\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly when old became the new \u2014 well \u2014 new. But today, as more and more celebrities choose to wear vintage, the all-important stretch of red carpet has started to look more like a museum hallway. At the Grammy\u2019s in February, Miley Cyrus, Laverne Cox and Olivia Rodrigo each arrived in vintage Bob Mackie, Comme des Garcons and Versace respectively. \u201cBig stars in old clothes was the trend of the night,\u201d wrote the New York Times\u2019 fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman. March\u2019s Oscars ceremony was another hotbed of second-hand dressing. Cardi B stepped out at the Vanity Fair after party in a black embellished lace Versace gown from Spring-Summer 2003, while Margot Robbie and Jennifer Lawrence wore Mugler and Givenchy\u00a0\u2014 both from 1996. That\u2019s before taking into account the moments outside of 2024\u00a0 \u2014 Cardi B, again, in Mugler\u2019s 1996 \u201cVenus\u201d shell dress at the 2019 Grammys, or Kim Kardashian in 2022, ascending the Met steps in Marilyn Monroe\u2019s museum-exhibited \u201cHappy Birthday, Mr. President,\u201d gown. More recently, at Monday\u2019s Met Gala, Emily Ratajkowski stepped out onto \u201cThe Garden of Time\u201d themed carpet in a haute couture Versace naked dress from 2001. Part way through the evening, Zendaya made a quick change into a black taffeta Givenchy gown from the same year she was born. But it was Kendall Jenner who made the loudest statement of the night, as she became the first person to wear her vintage 1999 Givenchy look in the public, according to the brand. \u2018The future of fashion\u2019 In reality, A-listers have been digging into the archives of fashion houses for more than two decades. In 2001, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger arrived at the Oscars in a canary yellow 1950s Jean Dess\u00e8s gown. Just behind her was Julia Roberts, minutes away from accepting her Academy Award for \u201cErin Brockovich,\u201d wearing a black velvet Valentino dress with dynamic white piping from 1992. But even industry insiders believe the current appetite for archival looks represents a shift in the fashion ecosystem. \u201cAt the (2024) Oscars, I think we probably saw more people wear archival vintage than ever before.\u201d said Erin Walsh, celebrity stylist to a roster of clients including Anne Hathaway, Selena Gomez and Sarah Jessica Parker, in a video interview with CNN. \u201cIt became the future (of fashion) instantly this year.\u201d One label in particular has been at the forefront of the archival movement. Mugler \u2014 the luxury French fashion house responsible for dressing Zendaya in a 30 kilogram full metal robot suit from 1995. The look, devised for the London premiere of \u201cDune: Part Two,\u201d transcended fashion, making headlines across the internet. According to WWD, the stunt generated a $152 million media impact value for the brand, and was the result of a year\u2019s worth of planning. \u201cEvery year we get countless requests to wear the (Fall-Winter 1997 haute couture) Chimera dress or the robot suit,\u201d Adrian Corsin, managing director of Mugler, told CNN over video call. (The Chimera dress is widely regarded as one of the most expensive couture creations ever made.) \u201cBut it\u2019s really about finding the right moment for us. That was finally the right moment.\u201d Once Mugler agreed to the request made by Zendaya\u2019s stylist and longtime collaborator Law Roach, the logistical talk could begin. What would she wear underneath? The original flesh-toned bodysuit had disappeared over the decades, so they would need a new one to shield Zendaya from the armor\u2019s perspex port holes. How would she get to the venue? The suit doesn\u2019t accommodate bending. Would she be able to walk in the garment? It was initially designed by Jean-Jacques Urcun for a short catwalk strut, while Zendaya needed to climb stairs. But above all else, would she even fit? \u201cThat was the main question,\u201d said Marion Bourd\u00e9e, Mugler\u2019s head of archives. Alterations beyond a slight extension of the legs were off the table, it would either work or it wouldn\u2019t. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t been worn for years and years, and Zendaya\u2019s proportions were quite different from the original model. But at the first fitting we were all quite moved, because it fit like a glove.\u201d Inside the archive Before the look was given a second lease of life, it had spent years in Mugler\u2019s archives \u2014 a secret place somewhere in the center of France that houses more than 6,000 priceless pieces. \u201cIt\u2019s very hidden, you wouldn\u2019t imagine from the outside that it\u2019s there,\u201d said Bourd\u00e9e. \u201cNobody has access to that place. Just Adrian and me.\u201d There, the suit was preserved in a custom box; the inside molded to the shape of each segment like a gun case. \u201cIt floats there basically, in this coffin box,\u201d said Corsin. Although interest in vintage fashion is rising amongst celebrity clients, not everyone is qualified to physically handle these pieces. \u201cUnfortunately there\u2019s some misconception around what a fashion archivist really is,\u201d said Julie Ann Clauss, owner of The Wardrobe\u00a0\u2014 a private LA-based storage service used by brands and individuals alike \u2014 in a video call. \u201cA lot of people use the term really broadly. I have a museum studies degree, and all professional archivists do.\u201d Clauss, who also works as an archivist for Tom Ford, said she was required to take college-level chemistry, as well as learn a second language, before qualifying in her role. \u201cYou need to understand the things that will go wrong if fabrics are stored improperly, or glass beads for example. There are so many different things that happen just as a natural result of chemical reactions between the piece and the environment, or the way it\u2019s handled.\u201d Archival storage spaces, like the one that stowed the 1995 Mugler robot suit, are more than just big closets filled with racks of clothes, too. Clauss\u2019 museum standard facility in LA preserves collections for a range of clients \u2014 from Calvin Klein, Marc Jacobs and Carolina Herrera to musicians and actors. \u201cIt\u2019s very clean, usually very white,\u201d she said. \u201cDust attracts pests. Moths don\u2019t eat garments, they eat protein and that\u2019s what they\u2019re going for on your sweater\u2026 It\u2019s the pieces of your hair, proteinaceous things.\u201d From the temperature down to the humidity, everything is painstakingly controlled to suspend the process of deterioration. Even the light must be filtered. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the lights on, unnecessarily,\u201d said Clauss. \u201cOtherwise you\u2019ll get what\u2019s known as light fugivity\u2026 where exposure causes fibers to weaken and eventually shatter and rip.\u201d Fashion\u2019s rat race But if these one-of-a-kind pieces are so fragile, and the method of their conservation so exact, how do celebrities even get their hands on them? \u201cI don\u2019t loan out,\u201d said Clauss. \u201cBut I get calls from stylists all the time that are under the impression I do. It\u2019s up to my individual clients. I redirect (the request) to the brand\u2019s press team who will make the decision.\u201d Who gets to borrow directly from brands is often a hierarchical question. \u201cRequests have increased a lot,\u201d said Bourd\u00e9e back at Mugler. \u201cSince Cardi, and even more after Kylie. But we want the loans of archives to remain exceptional.\u201d Jenner, who has been loaned three vintage looks by the label, sent a team to scout around the Brooklyn Museum\u2019s 2022 exhibition \u201cThierry Mugler: Couturissime\u201d before it was even finished to select her outfit options for opening night. \u201cWe allowed her stylists to come to the museum while we were still installing the looks on the mannequins, and they chose pieces that they would want to try on Kylie,\u201d Bourd\u00e9e said. But not everyone finds this level of access impressive. In 2022, when Kim Kardashian borrowed Marilyn Monroe\u2019s 1962 gown from Ripley\u2019s Believe It Or Not!, many on social media claimed the dress had been ruined \u2014 spurred on by photos of missing crystals and loose threads. (A few months later, Ripley\u2019s issued a statement insisting the garment did not suffer any damage and was received in that condition when won in a 2016 auction.) The International Council of Museums agreed that in the interest of preservation, historic pieces \u201cshould not be worn by anybody, public or private figures.\u201d Mugler, however, believes the risk is worth the reward. \u201cIf it\u2019s always stuffed away in boxes, people won\u2019t get to enjoy it,\u201d said Corsin. \u201cAnd even in exhibitions, pieces can be damaged,\u201d added Bourd\u00e9e. \u201cPeople fall into the displays.\u201d There are other options, too, says Erin Walsh, for those who are not able to leisurely browse museum-grade archives. \u201cPeople make it sound so mysterious to get great vintage,\u201d she said. \u201cVintage is wildly accessible. I\u2019ve been using (stores) like Shrimpton Couture, New York Vintage or Decades since I started my career 15 years ago.\u201d And while it\u2019s tempting to think the recent uptick in vintage was purely a renewed appreciation of fashion history, Walsh suspects there is a more practical answer for why the desire for older garments has skyrocketed. \u201cThere weren\u2019t enough samples (of current designer pieces),\u201d she said. \u201cIt seems like everybody\u2019s in a rat race to finish something very quickly, or there\u2019s not enough that can be made.\u201d Between awards season and fashion week preparation, Walsh believes designers are buckling under the increasing pace of the industry. \u201cThis need for pulling archive pieces, it really just highlights what\u2019s happening in the fashion marketplace. There\u2019s too many (events) for people to go to. We\u2019re being put into a situation where I don\u2019t think anybody can keep up with it. We\u2019re having to go with a different solution, there\u2019s no other way to keep up with demand.\u201d According to The Hollywood Reporter, fashion showrooms were reportedly \u201cwiped clean\u201d in January, following a backlog in press tours, premieres and events caused by the SAG-AFTRA strike last autumn. \u201cNobody was doing anything, then suddenly all the awards were at the same time. Anybody who was on the award circuit or who works in fashion didn\u2019t have one weekend off in three months,\u201d said Walsh. But whether it was born out of necessity or not, the cultural kudos an exclusive archival pull can bestow is powerful \u2014 for both the brand and the wearer. At the Met Gala, Kendall Jenner\u2019s vintage Givenchy gown made instant headlines across the internet. \u201cIt\u2019s such a special moment,\u201d she told Vogue on the night. \u201cI feel extremely honored that they\u2019re allowing me to wear it.\u201d And the more precious the garment, the more prestigious the outfit. Is there anything Mugler would never consider loaning, even for Zendaya or the Jenners? \u201cNever say never,\u201d Corsin said. \u201cEven the Chimera, one of the most coveted pieces in fashion history of the 20th century. All I can say for the moment is it hasn\u2019t been loaned out.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/07/style/vintage-red-carpet-fashion/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_style_gina-rinehart-namatjira-portrait-australia-intl-scli", "text": "Art is subjective. And while many artists long to share their work with the world, there\u2019s no guarantee that the audience will understand it, or even like it. That certainly seems to be the case with a painting by indigenous artist Vincent Namatjira, which includes a portrait of Australia\u2019s richest person, mining magnate Gina Rinehart. Rinehart has reportedly called for the National Gallery of Australia (NGA) to remove her portrait, one of 21 individual works that make up a single piece in Namatjira\u2019s exhibition \u201cAustralia in Colour,\u201d from display. The exhibition has been running at the gallery in the Australian capital, Canberra, since March. Other subjects in the piece include the late Queen Elizabeth II, American musician Jimi Hendrix, Australian Aboriginal rights activist Vincent Lingiari and the former Prime Minister of Australia Scott Morrison. Australian media has reported that Rinehart approached the NGA\u2019s director and chair to request the painting\u2019s removal. The NGA said in a statement to CNN Thursday that it \u201cwelcomes the public having a dialogue on our collection and displays.\u201d \u201cSince 1973, when the National Gallery acquired Jackson Pollocks\u2019 Blue Poles, there has been a dynamic discussion on the artistic merits of works in the national collection, and/or on display at the Gallery,\u201d the NGA statement continued. \u201cWe present works of art to the Australian public to inspire people to explore, experience and learn about art.\u201d Namatjira said in a statement that he paints \u201cpeople who are wealthy, powerful, or significant \u2013 people who have had an influence on this country, and on me personally, whether directly or indirectly, whether for good or for bad.\u201d \u201cI paint the world as I see it,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t have to like my paintings, but I hope they take the time to look and think, \u2018why has this Aboriginal bloke painted these powerful people? What is he trying to say?\u2019\u201d \u201cSome people might not like it, other people might find it funny but I hope people look beneath the surface and see the serious side too,\u201d Namatjira added. Rinehart is the executive chairman of Hancock Prospecting, a privately owned mining company that was founded by her father, Lang Hancock. CNN has reached out to Hancock Prospecting for comment but did not receive a response. Rinehart has an estimated net worth of $30.2 billion USD, according to Forbes. She \u201cremained unshakable\u201d at the top of Forbes\u2019 Australia\u2019s 50 Richest list for 2024, the outlet reported in February. Australia\u2019s National Association for the Visual Arts (NAVA) has spoken out to support Namatjira, CNN\u2019s affiliate 9News has reported. \u201cWhile Rinehart has the right to express her opinions about the work, she does not have the authority to pressure the gallery into withdrawing the painting simply because she dislikes it,\u201d NAVA\u2019s executive director Penelope Benton said, according to 9News. NAVA offered its \u201cunwavering support\u201d to National Gallery of Australia, 9News reported, stating that it was concerned that Rinehart\u2019s demand to remove the portrait \u201csets a dangerous precedent for censorship and the stifling of creative expression.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/style/gina-rinehart-namatjira-portrait-australia-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_style_catherine-princess-wales-tatler-scli-intl", "text": "A new portrait of Catherine, Princess of Wales has stoked controversy online, with some royal fans criticizing the work for its portrayal of the future British Queen. The painting, by British-Zambian artist Hannah Uzor, features on the cover of the July issue of Tatler magazine. It aims to honor the \u201cstrength and dignity\u201d of the princess, according to a statement from the publication sent to CNN Thursday. It depicts Catherine during her appearance at the first state banquet of King Charles III\u2019s reign, and Uzor said she studied photographs of the princess in the process of creating the work. \u201cWhen you can\u2019t meet the sitter in person, you have to look at everything you can find and piece together the subtle human moments revealed in different photographs: do they have a particular way of standing or holding their head or hands? Do they have a recurrent gesture?,\u201d she said in the statement. Uzor also revealed that Kate\u2019s recent video announcing a cancer diagnosis informed the work. \u201cAll my portraits are made up of layers of a personality, constructed from everything I can find about them,\u201d she said in the statement. However, not everybody appreciated the portrayal of the princess. \u201cThis is dreadful - somehow, I\u2019m not sure the artist is a fan of the Princess - it looks like a bad GCSE project,\u201d reads one comment under a post from Tatler on X. \u201cThis looks nothing like the Princess of Wales. It\u2019s so awful, it\u2019s disrespectful,\u201d reads another. \u201cI agree with the sentiments of strength and dignity but the portrait lacks any resemblance to the Princess of Wales,\u201d said another. However, some did praise the work, with one calling the painting \u201cbeautiful.\u201d \u201cAm I the only person who likes this? It\u2019s art, not a photo,\u201d wrote another commenter. And it wasn\u2019t just social media users who reacted to the painting. Alastair Sooke, chief art critic at UK newspaper The Daily Telegraph, said in an article that the painting was \u201cintolerably bad\u201d and \u201cshows no flicker of resemblance to its subject.\u201d \u201cHas there been a flatter, more lifeless royal portrait in living memory?\u201d Sooke wrote. \u201cBeneath a Lego-like helmet of unmodulated, monotonously brown \u2018hair,\u2019 this Princess of Wales has as much charisma as a naff figurine atop a wedding cake.\u201d Kate Mansey, royal editor at The Times of London, was also non-plus. \u201cI\u2019m not quite sure what to say about this one, except, hmm\u2026\u201d she wrote on X. The backlash follows a similar discussion surrounding the first official portrait of King Charles III since his coronation, which was revealed earlier this month. The 8.5 by 6.5-foot painting by British artist Jonathan Yeo depicts the monarch wearing the uniform of the Welsh Guards, sword in hand, against a fiery red background that appears to almost swallow him whole, as a butterfly looks like it\u2019s about to land on his shoulder. While the King is reportedly happy with the portrait, others criticized the lurid red brushstrokes, with one person likening it to a \u201cposter for a horror film.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/style/catherine-princess-wales-tatler-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_03_27_style_titanic-door-prop-auction-planet-hollywood", "text": "It\u2019s one of the most iconic, and hotly-debated, props in cinematic history: The floating wood panel that spared Kate Winslet\u2019s \u201cTitanic\u201d character Rose DeWitt Bukater from icy North Atlantic waters after the titular ocean liner\u2019s sinking \u2014 but not Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s Jack Dawson. And it\u2019s now been sold at auction for more than $700,000. \u201cOften mistakenly referred to as a door, the ornate structure was in reality part of the door frame just above the first-class lounge entrance,\u201d Heritage Auctions wrote in the auction notes. The prop\u2019s pivotal role in the \u201cbig scene, big goodbye\u201d moment, as the auction house had described it, features Rose floating on the floral-carved panel as Jack, having tried and failed to also rest atop, has succumbed to the cold. As a rescue boat arrives, Rose is forced to pry her hand from his frozen grip \u2014 while uttering the famous line \u201cI\u2019ll never let go, I promise,\u201d through chattering teeth \u2014 as she swims to her rescuers. The ornate balsa wood panel had previously been displayed at a Planet Hollywood in Orlando, Florida before being stored in their archives for some two decades, the auction house told CNN. It was sold alongside a roster of other props at the \u201cTreasures From Planet Hollywood\u201d auction, which included memorabilia items once displayed at Planet Hollywood locations worldwide and from its archives. These included pieces such as the whip from\u00a0\u201cIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\u201d and the ax from \u201cThe Shining.\u201d Across almost 1,600 lots in total, the five-day-long auction brought in $15.7 million, according\u00a0to a press release. But the \u201cTitanic\u201d flotsam took the prize for the highest-priced piece, far exceeding its starting price of $40,000 and selling for a grand total of $718,750 following a high-energy bidding war. Several other \u201cTitanic\u201d props were also put up for sale, including the pastel chiffon evening gown Rose wears in the movie on the night of the sinking and the ship\u2019s helm wheel, which sold for $118,750 and $200,000 respectively. A 2012 episode of the Discovery show \u201cMythBusters\u201d infamously found that two people could have survived long enough on the panel \u2014 which measures approximately eight feet (2.4 meters) long and just over three feet (1 meter) wide \u2014 if they added a life jacket for extra buoyancy. Remarking on the results, however, \u201cTitanic\u201d director James Cameron told the show\u2019s hosts, Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage, that Jack needed to die regardless. And in 2022, Cameron, alongside a hypothermia expert, tried to put an end to the debate once and for all with a\u00a0simulated test\u00a0to see if two people of the same body mass as Winslet and DiCaprio could have really stayed afloat on a piece of wood of the same size. Their final answer was no, it was not possible. There was no additional testing of these theories on the prop itself prior to its sale, as the auction house chooses to \u201chandle all items with great care when in transit and in storage,\u201d Heritage Auctions told CNN. But its new owner, who is choosing to remain anonymous, could well be planning a pool day, having been drawn in by the allure of the over two-decade-long mystery. \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is this massive interest in the films of the 1980s and 1990s,\u201d said Joe Maddalena, executive vice president of Heritage Auctions, in a statement. \u201cThere has been a generational shift to where these massive franchises of the 1980s and 1990s \u2014 the \u2018Home Alone\u2019s, the \u2018Indiana Jones\u2019 films, the \u2018Die Hard\u2019s \u2014 are now collectors\u2019 favorites\u2026 Collectors are finally rewarding these artifacts as what they are: cultural artifacts akin to the fine art of old.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/style/titanic-door-prop-auction-planet-hollywood/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_04_29_style_dodecahedron-roman-object-mystery-scn-scli-intl", "text": "Amateur archaeologists in England have unearthed one of the largest Roman dodecahedrons ever found, but mystery surrounds what it was actually used for. The 12-sided object is one of just 33 known to exist in Roman Britain, and one of approximately 130 in the world. It is considered \u201cone of archaeology\u2019s great enigmas,\u201d according to the Norton Disney History and Archaeology Group, an amateur group based in the English region of Lincolnshire where it was found in June. Measuring about 8 centimeters (3 inches) across, the dodecahedron is hollow and covered with 12 holes of varying sizes. The 1,700-year-old object will be displayed at the Lincoln Museum from May 4 until early September. \u201cIt\u2019s a real pleasure to have the Norton Disney dodecahedron joining us\u2026 just a stone\u2019s throw from where it was found,\u201d Andrea Martin, exhibitions and interpretations manager at the museum, said in a Lincolnshire County Council press release. \u201cTo have the opening of the display coincide with the Lincoln Festival of History is a real coup.\u201d The release describes the dodecahedron as \u201cone of the largest examples\u201d discovered. However, experts still aren\u2019t sure exactly what the Romans used the dodecahedron for. \u201cIt is completely unique,\u201d said Richard Parker, secretary of the Norton Disney History and Archaeology Group, adding that no similar objects have ever been found. He said that, unlike other dodecahedra, this one is undamaged. \u201cOurs is absolutely in a fabulous condition. It\u2019s complete, undamaged, and it clearly was considered of great value by whoever made it and by those that used it,\u201d Parker said. \u201cSo there must have been a very important reason for it to be deposited in the ground in the way that it was.\u201d Parker told CNN there are no descriptions of the dodecahedron in Roman literature, and they have not been depicted pictorially in mosaics. There are also several features that make it difficult to discern what its intended purpose was. All of the dodecahedra are of different sizes, meaning they were not used for measurement, he said. Because it is undamaged with no signs of wear, it is unlikely to have been a tool, Parker added. Parker\u2019s group does have one working theory, however. \u201cMost likely they were some form of religious or ritual object,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Romans were a very superstitious lot, and generally required signs to allow them to make decisions in their daily lives.\u201d One indication supporting that idea is that the object was found near a small Roman mounted rider god figurine with \u201cstrong religious connections,\u201d Parker said. The artifact was discovered in 1989 by metal detectorists, and the figurine is \u201coften found on temple sites.\u201d The organization plans to return to the dig site later this year to conduct further excavations, which Parker hopes will help establish context on how the area was used. Parker said he is optimistic that the mystery will be solved because this dodecahedron was found in an archaeological excavation area, whereas \u201cmany of those that were found 200 or 300 years ago had no context to where they were found.\u201d \u201cIt is quite a complex story to tell that we\u2019re just starting to tease out,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/29/style/dodecahedron-roman-object-mystery-scn-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}

Born to a Filipino mother and African American father, the 24-year-old\u2019s win was celebrated on social media as helping to \u201cshatter\u201d traditional beauty ideals long held in the country. \u201cChelsea\u2019s win challenges our ingrained preference for Eurocentric beauty (features) and lighter complexions in our nation,\u201d wrote one user in response to an Instagram post of the win on Miss Universe Philippines\u2019 official account. \u201cFilipino beauty standard shattered into pieces,\u201d read another. Representing Bulacan, a province to the north of Manila, Manalo beat out 52 other contestants from around the archipelago and overseas. The competition was held at the SM Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay. As the competition narrowed down to the top five finalists, Manalo was asked on stage how she would use her beauty and confidence to empower others. \u201cAs a woman of color, I have always faced challenges in my life. I was told that beauty has standards, actually,\u201d she said, adding that she was taught to \u201cbelieve in my mother, to always believe in yourself, uphold the vows that you have.\u201d \u201cBecause of these, I am already influencing a lot of women who are facing me right now,\u201d she said, gazing out to the packed arena. Manalo\u2019s win is part of a wider conversation about diversifying notions of beauty in the Philippines, a country where certain Western ideals have long persisted, shaped in part by the country\u2019s colonial past. Lighter-skinned actors and models typically star in major TV shows, movies and fashion campaigns and as common in other Asian countries, skin lightening treatments and products are pervasive. Manalo, who began modeling at 14, described her own insecurities growing up, in a YouTube video on Empire Philippines, which livestreamed the event. \u201cI grew up having insecurities as I was always bullied because of my skin and my hair type,\u201d she said, crediting her friends and family for helping her \u201crealize that I am beautiful in my own extraordinary way.\u201d Manalo will represent the Philippines in the Miss Universe pageant to be held in Mexico in September. She is vying to earn the fifth title for the country, following the footsteps of Gloria Diaz in 1969, Margie Moran in 1973, and Pia Wurtzbach in 2015 (after host Steve Harvey initially declared the wrong winner.) Catriona Gray was the last Filipino to win the title in 2018. Over 100 countries will be represented at Miss Universe 2024. This year will see the competition remove any upper age limit set for its contestants \u2014 previously, those competing were required to be between the age of 18 and 28.

{"id": "2024_05_16_style_vandals-target-oldest-chinese-dragon-in-australian-intl-hnk", "text": "Australian police are seeking two people for allegedly vandalizing a century-old Chinese parade dragon and other valuable artefacts at a museum in a small town known for its historic links to China. The vandalism took place last week at the Golden Dragon Museum in Bendigo, about 100 miles northwest of Melbourne, according to the police and head of the museum. Victoria Police said a man and a woman are suspected of damaging AUD$100,000 ($66,900) worth of art and historical items, before making off in a silver Toyota Prado on May 5. \u201cInvestigators believe the duo used a liquid to cause damage to multiple statues and paintings,\u201d police said, adding that the suspects were with two children at the time. Among the artefacts attacked was Loong \u2013 described by the museum as the \u201coldest complete imperial processional dragon in the world.\u201d \u201cLoong\u201d is a sacred mythical creature in Chinese culture \u2013 usually translated as dragon in English \u2013 and is often the protagonist in festivities and rituals. Dragon dances have been documented at ceremonial events since the Han Dynasty (202 BCE to 220 CE) and often involve teams of dancers manipulating a giant dragon puppet through the streets. Bendigo, currently a city of some 100,000 people, has had Chinese residents for more than a century. Chinese immigrants first arrived mostly from southern China in the mid-1800s during the Victorian goldrush and at one point made up 20 percent of the town\u2019s residents. Miners and merchants brought their customs and culture with them to a place they once called \u201cDai Gum San\u201d - or \u201cBig Gold Mountain,\u201d according to Bendigo Tourism. To this day, a large dragon parade is held every Easter to raise money for a local hospital. The Golden Dragon Museum was opened in 1991 \u201cto document, interpret and preserve the Chinese heritage in Australia\u201d according to the museum\u2019s website. Loong, which dates back 1901, was routinely paraded through the streets of Victoria until the 1970s when it was retired. Hugo Leschen, Chief Executive Officer of the museum, told CNN that they found oily liquid running down Loong\u2019s nose. Its successor Sun Loong, which took over to parade around the Bendigo until it was also retired in 2019, was also damaged, Leschen said, citing stains on the second dragon\u2019s tongue. Other parts of the museum were also targeted. Security camera footage aired on CNN affiliate Nine News showed a woman clad in a white sweater and grey beanie splashing liquid at a Buddhist altar. A man stood next to her in the clip. Stains were also found on at least 35 paintings and several statues of Chinese deities in the temple as well as a garden next door managed by the museum, Leschen said. \u201cWith these further attacks it is now evident that this was no random act of mindless vandalism but rather a planned and sustained malicious attack across various heritage, cultural and religious sites for reasons unknown,\u201d he said. The Chinese Community Council of Australia condemned the vandalism in a statement. While police have yet to comment on the motivation, the group is concerned the act \u201cmay have been racially motivated.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/style/vandals-target-oldest-chinese-dragon-in-australian-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_03_style_first-luxury-watch-buyer-guide", "text": "Navigating the world of \u201chaute horologie,\u201d the highest form of watchmaking, can be intimidating for a beginner. If you\u2019ve found yourself in the enviable position of shopping for your first luxury timepiece, you will likely have more questions than answers. From understanding the terminology, to knowing where to shop, the questions to ask yourself before you set foot in a store (or auction house) and how to avoid buying a fake, CNN Style has done the research and asked experts for their top tips. 1. Learn the lingo Just like buying a car, there are some technical terms prospective watch buyers can benefit from knowing. Here are a few: a. Parts of the watch  Crown: Small knob found on the side of the watch used to change the date and time. On a manual watch, the knob is used to wind it so the movement keeps going. Movement: The complex mechanisms that make the watch run.\u00a0 Bezel: The frame that holds in place the crystal protecting the watch face. Lug: The parts that connect the watch case to the bracelet (strap). Complication: A watch function beyond regular time-telling. Sometimes watches can have several added \u201ccomplications.\u201d For example, a chronograph has a stopwatch, while one with a perpetual calendar shows the month and day of the week, and a GMT tells the time across multiple time zones.\u00a0 Skeleton: A watch that showcases rather than covers up its inner workings. Tourbillon: An additional mechanism said to improve the accuracy of a watch. Most modern-day watches do not need a tourbillon to be highly accurate, but the complicated mechanism often pushes the price up.\u00a0 Quartz movement: Battery-powered watch. Automatic movement: A mechanical watch that does not need a battery to move, it relies on movement from the wearer to wind. b. Other useful terms Grey market: distribution or selling channels not officially authorized by the original manufacturer like forums, Instagram or Facebook marketplace. Reference: Model number that can tell you details about the watch; what it\u2019s made of, the design specifications etc.  Blue-chip brands: Well-known and reputable watchmaker brands like Patek Philippe, Cartier, Rolex and Vacheron Constantin with history and a track record of producing excellent timepieces. 2. Decide if you want a new or pre-owned watch Are you looking for the latest model from a trending brand, or are you interested in investing in a piece of history, or a timeless classic? If it\u2019s a new release, bear in mind these often come with a lot of fanfare \u2014 and a long waiting list \u2014 so you may find yourself lusting after a watch that simply can\u2019t be purchased within the timeframe you\u2019d like. Luxury watchmakers often require buyers to effectively \u201cprove\u201d their commitment to buying a popular model by requiring them to buy less coveted models before they can purchase the watch of their dreams \u2014 which can have waiting lists that can be months or years long, said the head of Sotheby Asia\u2019s watches department Joey Luk.Some, like independent watchmaker Charles Frodsham & Co. she adds, have a more than 10 year wait. \u201cDon\u2019t bother with it,\u201d said Hong Kong-based co-founder of The Horology Club Johnathan Chan, of the expectation for shoppers to buy watches they don\u2019t need to ultimately be able to get what they want. Given the time and money involved, he believes it makes more financial sense to pay a slight premium for a watch from a reputable second-hand dealer with clear provenance. If you are open to buying second hand, there\u2019s a thriving pre-owned luxury watch market out there, but be aware of the risks if you\u2019re not working with a trusted dealer who is able to certify the authenticity of the timepiece pre-sale. Think carefully about where you are shopping. An unknown, first-time seller on Facebook marketplace will likely warrant more scrutiny than a well-established dealer with a long list of previous customers who can vouch for them. Auction houses such as Christies and Sotheby\u2019s have in-house experts tasked with vetting the watches that they take in, and newer second-hand platforms such as Chrono 24 verify all the dealers on their site. This doesn\u2019t mean fakes don\u2019t make it onto the market, so you must do your research and \u2014 if possible \u2014 get the watch verified by the brand directly before completing the purchase. But if you\u2019d rather not take on any risk, going direct to a retailer may be your best bet. Away from the trending new models, there are of course plenty of good quality watches to be purchased direct from the maker. \u201cAt least you know there\u2019s someone to go to if anything goes wrong,\u201d said The Horology Club co-founder Helbert Tsang. 3. Buy a watch for the right reasons and consider what you need from it Don\u2019t get sucked into hype around a watch. This is a personal investment that you\u2019ll likely want to love wearing for a long time. Also, be careful if resale value is your main motivation. Tim Stracke, founder and chairman of leading watch resale platform Chrono24 said,\u201cI always (advise) don\u2019t first of all look at the financial returns,\u201d he said during an interview at the Watches and Wonders Fair in Geneva earlier this month. \u201cLook at the emotional return; what do you really like, what makes you smile every time you look at a piece?\u201d Sotheby\u2019s Luk agrees: \u201cAlways pick your favorite watch,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like the watch and you just bought that for investment, then it\u2019s going to be a waste, because it\u2019s going to sit in the safe forever.\u201d Ask yourself, what do I need the watch for? Is it something you\u2019ll wear to play tennis or to time your swim laps? In which case you may want a sturdy, waterproof, sports watch with a high degree of accuracy, said Luk. Maybe you\u2019re in the market for an elegant dress watch to wear to a wedding or you\u2019re looking for a mechanical masterpiece or a conversation-starter with a unique design. Are you shopping for an anniversary or birthday present for someone special? Perhaps select a model from a year that holds sentimental value. Luk also advises first-time buyers stick with established blue-chip brands that have a longstanding history. \u201cThey have a better reputation for quality and there is more info. on the market \u2013 it would be easier for beginners to do their research, check their historic prices and compare to the recent results,\u201d she told CNN via text message. These brands, she wrote are \u201cmore reliable and the prices are relatively stable,\u201d compared to lesser-known brands \u201cwhere there is limited info. online and it\u2019s difficult to monitor the price.\u201d 4. Try it on. Comfort is key Avoid buying anything you can\u2019t try on yourself. Just because a watch looks good in an advert or on a celebrity\u2019s wrist, it might not suit you. Watches can look very different in real life. Collector Carlos Pang, another co-founder of The Horology Club, found this with the Patek 3940. \u201cIt\u2019s a 36mm diameter watch, which for a lot of people might be a bit small, looking at the specs. But, once you try it on, the way the case is (designed), it\u2019s a bit fuller.\u201dAnd remember that you\u2019ll be wearing it for long stretches of the day, so comfort is essential. Consider the weight of the watch, and the material of the strap, for example. \u201cI definitely value wearability a lot,\u201d said Helbert Tsang. 5. Like a watch, but can\u2019t afford it? See if the designer made any others While on the lookout for a watch to wear to his wedding, Pang saw a six-figure Audemars Piguet watch. \u201cI really liked that watch\u2026 but at that time I didn\u2019t have much money,\u201d he said. Instead, he did his research and found the designer, in this case Gerald Genta, who had made watches for other brands that were more affordable. \u201cI went with the IWC Ingenieur in the end. I bought it secondhand and that\u2019s the watch I wore to my wedding. I still have that one today.\u201d 6.

{"id": "style_article_liu-heung-shing-coca-cola-snap-mic-intl-hnk", "text": "A young man stands grinning in Beijing\u2019s Forbidden City. It\u2019s the dead of winter, and one of his hands is buried deep into the pockets of his long overcoat to protect it from the chill. The other grasps the unmistakable contours of a glass Coca-Cola bottle. Today, Coke is the world\u2019s most famous soft drink and can be found just about anywhere. But back in 1981, when the image was shot by Pulitzer-Prize winning photographer Liu Heung Shing, it was only just getting into the hands of ordinary Chinese people. Liu, who was in his late 20s when he began working for Time magazine in Beijing, felt the country was on the cusp of a great cultural shift following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976.  \u201cThe changes (at first) were subtle, and unless you lived there, you wouldn\u2019t have noticed,\u201d he recalled during an interview at his home in Hong Kong.  He had earlier photographed people grieving for Mao along the banks of the Pearl River in Guangzhou. It was here that he was struck by how differently people carried themselves compared to what he had seen in late-1950s China, where he grew up during the disastrous Great Leap Forward campaign \u2014 a series of failed industrialization policies \u2014 before moving back to Hong Kong as a child. Under Mao, the country went on to suffer from widespread famine and poverty, and the tumultuous years of the Cultural Revolution. But in the aftermath of the Chinese leader\u2019s death, Liu said, \u201csuddenly, people\u2019s steps looked a little bit lighter, they dropped their shoulders and their faces looked more relaxed.\u201d It would prove to be a relatively liberal period in Chinese history \u2014 politically, economically and in terms of everyday life, which Liu captured in candid shots. One photo from the time showed a plastic surgeon and his client after a cosmetic procedure. Another depicted people gathering at a \u201cDemocracy Wall\u201d in Beijing, where they wrote now-unthinkable criticisms of the government. One of Liu\u2019s most iconic images was captured on his way into the Time bureau after he had the strange feeling that something was \u201cmissing.\u201d He turned his car around and, sure enough, a large portrait of Mao that had once hung prominently on a building had been freshly taken down. He quickly shot images of workers gathered around the depiction of the late Chairman, with some of their scaffolding visible in the frame. This was China \u201cmoving out of the shadow of Mao,\u201d he said. \u2018It tastes so-so\u2019 In December 1978, Coca-Cola became the first foreign enterprise permitted to enter the mainland Chinese market since the communist revolution. That same month, Beijing and Washington announced the normalization of Sino-American relations and Deng Xiaoping kick-started China\u2019s transformative economic reforms with his \u201cOpen Door\u201d policy. (Coca-Cola was first introduced to China in the 1920s but had been forced to leave in 1949, along with other foreign companies, by a government that regarded it as bourgeois). Liu had photographed the opening of a joint-venture bottling plant in Beijing, capturing Coke chairman Roberto Goizueta and Chinese trade officials drinking Coca Cola and holding bottles aloft to cries of \u201cganbei\u201d (cheers). He then thought to himself, \u201cNow where do I find a (regular) Chinese person enjoying this (drink)?\u201d He headed to the Forbidden City, with its heavy flow of tourists, and soon found a man named Zhang Wei purchasing a Coke from a small stand. \u201cI remember he made a comment when he drank this syrupy Coke: \u2018It tastes so-so\u2019\u201d said Liu, who ended up taking a few shots with one of the imperial palace\u2019s picturesque pavilions in the background.  The response to Coke itself may have been underwhelming, but the snap perfectly captured the curiosity and openness many Chinese people felt at the time. \u201cAs a photographer, I of course realized the significance. That this man, dressed in a ubiquitous PLA (People\u2019s Liberation Army) coat, was one of the very first people to taste it,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cBut I didn\u2019t realize it would become part of the Chinese collective memory.\u201d The image would be widely published and displayed in the following years, and he later became friends with Zhang. In 1983, it appeared in Liu\u2019s photography book \u201cChina after Mao,\u201d a collection of images taken between 1976 and 1982. More recently he included it in his book \u201cLiu Heung Shing: A Life in a Sea of Red.\u201d   The photographer would go on to document other periods and profound events in the country\u2019s modern history, including the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. And just like those pictures of young student activists calling for democracy, Liu\u2019s Coca-Cola photograph feels part of another era altogether. With its apparent embrace of the new and the foreign \u2014 ideas encapsulated in that most American of drinks \u2014 the image stands in stark contrast to today\u2019s China, where relations with the US are at an all-time low. Xi Jinping\u2019s nationalist agenda has generated increasingly xenophobic attitudes towards the West.   \u201cI realized that the story I did in the last quarter of the 20th century (would) continue to carry relevance into the 21st century,\u201d Liu said. \u201cEspecially with the story of China, I never doubt that these photographs are in the Chinese people\u2019s collective memory. \u201cEven though this memory keeps being re-edited\u2026 the good thing about a photograph, is you cannot re-edit it. It becomes an image seared in people\u2019s minds.\u201d Top image: A 1981 photograph of a man with a Coke bottle in Beijing\u2019s Forbidden City, shot by Liu Heung Shing.

{"id": "2024_05_24_style_parties-monaco-grand-prix-f1", "text": "The Monaco Grand Prix gets underway this weekend in Monte Carlo with its heady combination of glamor and adrenaline, not only for the tens of thousands who descend on the pristine principality, but for the millions watching across the world. Even those who are typically indifferent to motorsports can find themselves enraptured, or at least intrigued, by the sheer spectacle of Formula One cars hurtling along the country\u2019s winding streets. It is also where you will find celebrities happily jostling their way through the crowds and cameras. \u201cIt is unlike anything I have ever been to, it is electric,\u201d exclaimed Spider-Man actor Tom Holland while walking last year\u2019s grid. And of course, there is plenty of wealth on display. Monaco is nicknamed \u201cthe billionaires\u2019 playground\u201d for good reason. Here, designer stores, supercars, multi-million-dollar yachts and astronomically priced restaurants are \u2018la norme\u2019, but during the three-day Grand Prix, the eye-watering ostentation increases three-fold. When demand is high and options are limited, it is all to play for among the world\u2019s wealthiest who are keen to revel in the race\u2019s iconic location and party \u2018til dawn. If they are not using their own superyacht as a base, they might book into a private villa on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur or check-in to Fairmont Hotel, H\u00f4tel Hermitage or H\u00f4tel de Paris in Monte Carlo itself. A pioneer of Grand Prix party culture Of course, it is not only about finding the finest suites to rest your head, but the premium spots for dining and clubbing, whether it is the top table at Cipriani, Sass Caf\u00e9 or Caf\u00e9 de Paris or the best booth at exclusive night spots such as Jimmy\u2019z or Amber Lounge. The latter has the distinction of being the go-to destination for the F1 fraternity, including Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen, while previous guests have included Justin Bieber, Kim Kardashian, Kylie Minogue and Prince Albert of Monaco. Established in 2003 by former racing driver Eddie Irvine\u2019s sister Sonia as a \u201cpost-race destination\u201d for drivers and VIP guests, Amber Lounge is regarded a pioneer of the Grand Prix party culture. Notably, it will be marking its 20-year milestone (there was a year off during Covid) as \u201cthe most exclusive party in the world\u201d with panache over the Monaco weekend with three nights of events costing just over \u20ac1.5m ($1.6m) to produce. There will be after parties at an Amber Lounge beach club on the terrace of Le Meridien Beach Plaza (the only hotel in Monte Carlo with its own private beach), as well as VIP viewing of the race from aboard a 108ft superyacht moored just feet from the circuit\u2019s famous Tabac corner. \u201cThe size of the yacht also means we are as close to the action as you can get, unlike the larger yachts that are pulled back (from the coast). It also feels more intimate and exclusive on board. We have a lot of repeat clients (typically from the US, UK and Middle East) who want to network and build relationships,\u201d said Lauren Green, Managing Director of Amber Lounge who oversees logistics of the three-day pop-up event in Monaco, as well as other F1 locations including Singapore, Las Vegas and Abu Dhabi. Unsurprisingly, a ticket to one of the most coveted trackside spots does not come cheap. A one-day VIP viewing package for the race itself on Sunday costs \u20ac3,500 ($3,800) per person \u2014 and the 65 available tickets sold out within two weeks of going on sale in May 2023. While the dress code is \u2018Riviera chic,\u2019 shoes, however expensive, must be discarded on embarking so as not to ruin the yacht\u2019s teak decking. Tickets include free-flowing beverages, including champagne, wine and signature cocktails, as well as food, a DJ and dancers before tenders return to shore at 6.30pm. \u2018The center of the universe for a weekend\u2019 At the club\u2019s after parties held over the race weekend, a small army of waiting staff serve ever-flowing drinks for a 1000 strong crowd on Saturday and Sunday nights. On arrival, guests ring a bell and a gloved hand appears through a flower wall proffering a glass of champagne. Attendees have paid anything from \u20ac600 ($650) for entry to the afterparty on Saturday (the F1 qualifying day) to \u20ac800 ($870) on the Sunday (race day) in the hope they can party alongside drivers, celebrities and guests of high net worth, away from the public gaze. For \u20ac40,000 ($43,400), partygoers can book what\u2019s known as a \u201cdiamond table package\u201d for 10 people \u2014 a prime table with unobstructed views of the stage and DJ booth (Fatman Scoop and Jax Jones are the acts for 2024), as well as cirqus-themed performances, and Methuselahs of champagne (6-liters) and premium vodka. Add an extra \u20ac10,000 ($10,800) on for a Salmanazar \u2014 a nine-liter bottle of champagne that requires a team of four to carry it to the table, or \u20ac20,000 ($21,600) for a 12-liter Balthazar-sized bottle. The top-tier tables also have their own \u201chosts,\u201d who act as a concierge; liaising with VIPs\u2019 assistants or drivers to ensure guests can be greeted and escorted along the black carpet without having to queue. Amber Lounge might be one of the most exclusive and expensive events taking place during the Monaco Grand Prix weekend, but Monte Carlo itself is a veritable party hub. It\u2019s common for champagne glasses and bottles to be cleared from the track from the previous night\u2019s revelry ahead of that day\u2019s qualifying or race sessions. \u201cThe C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur is one of the truly exceptional global destinations, and Monaco is at the heart of it. The scenery, the sophistication, and the opulence are unmatched,\u201d said Bruce Bundrant, Senior Vice President of Business Development for rEvolution, a global sports marketing agency who lived in Monaco for three years as Commercial Director for AS Monaco FC. \u201cAs a former resident, I can tell you there are two sides to the F1 Grand Prix arriving in Monaco. On one side, your town is now the center of the universe for a weekend where the top 1% of the 1% from all over the world arrive and engage in outrageous parties and events on yachts, at luxury hotels suites, and in hilltop mansions,\u201d Bundrant explained. \u201cOn the other, it\u2019s the hybrid of the arrival of a hurricane and New Year\u2019s Eve. A week out from the race, grocery store shelves are emptied as locals know it\u2019s impossible to move around the principality when the F1 circus is in town. During the Grand Prix, your quiet, regular neighborhood bar has a line around the corner, charges a $100 cover charge, and a drink that typically costs $20 will be $50. But it\u2019s a truly unforgettable weekend, with an unreplicable buzz and energy. Sure, it\u2019s expensive, but come the Monday, things are back to normal.\u201d As normal as it can ever be in a place as excessive as Monaco. As the jet set move onto their next port of call, and the racetrack is dismantled, so too is the Amber Lounge club as preparations continue for their next F1 event, which will be Singapore in September. \u201cThere is no rest at Amber Lounge,\u201d Green quipped. \u201cJust a lot of adrenaline. And a lot of coffee.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/style/parties-monaco-grand-prix-f1/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_style_mona-lisa-setting-italian-town-claim", "text": "Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s Mona Lisa \u2014 one of the most famous paintings in the world \u2014 is shrouded in mystery; from questions around the figures identity, to her puzzling, enigmatic expression. Now, at least one of the artwork\u2019s secrets has been revealed, according to a geologist based in Italy. Ann Pizzorusso, who is both a geologist and an art historian specializing in Leonardo and the Renaissance era, believes she has deduced the location of the Mona Lisa using her geological expertise. Three decades ago, Pizzorusso visited the town of Lecco on the southeastern shore of Lake Como in Italy \u2014 where she believes the painting is set \u2014\u00a0to retrace Leonardo\u2019s steps, armed with diary entries and drawings from the artist. \u201cIn his notebook he mentions being in Lecco,\u201d she told CNN in a phone interview. \u201cHe was working as an engineer.\u201d According to Pizzorusso, the project Leonardo was working on was canceled, but his geological field sketches remained (one red chalk drawing of a mountain range near Lecco belongs to the Royal Collection at Windsor, London). While Pizzorusso is not the first to have theorized on the location of the Mona Lisa (in 2011, an art historian attributed the painting\u2019s scenery to a small town called Bobbio, while another to Arezzo) she believes she is the first geologist. Previous calculations have concentrated on the arched bridge over the Mona Lisa\u2019s right shoulder. However, Pizzorusso insists more can be gleaned from the unique rock formation in the horizon. \u201cBridges are fungible,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you look in the background, you\u2019ll see pinnacles. It\u2019s a type of erosion that happens in limestone that has fractures in it and breaks off in blocks, almost like a sawtooth pattern\u2026 We can show limestone exists in (Lecco). When you look at the Mona Lisa, there\u2019s a series of mountains in the background that have this sawtooth pattern.\u201d Similarly, the body of water behind Mona Lisa is geologically specific, believed by Pizzorusso to be Lake Como \u2014 a subalpine glacial lake dating back around 10,000 years. \u201cIf you look behind her you have the elongated glacial lakes that have a particular form like fingers,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause when the glacier moved it scoured out certain pieces of land.\u201d Despite her confidence, Pizzorusso kept her inkling quiet for 30 years, telling only other Leonardo scholars in casual conversation. She returned to Lecco this week, still assured that \u201ceverything added up,\u201d and will now present her findings at a geology conference in the town. While the pairing of earth science and art history may seem disparate, Pizzorusso argues the interdisciplinary approach can enrich the viewing experience of Leonardo\u2019s work. \u201cBotticelli, even Michelangelo did terrible backgrounds because they felt the figures were more important,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cIf the background is painted right, it gives you more of an appreciation for nature.\u201d Though Pizzorusso admits she is surprised at the widespread interest. \u201cMaybe (Leonardo) was trying to channel me for the environmental movement or something,\u201d she joked. \u201cIt\u2019s a testament to how much people love this painting.\u201d But the discovery may only lead to more mystery. If the location is Lecco, as Pizzorusso suggests, more questions remain as to why the renowned painter chose that particular spot, for this particular portrait. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who (Mona Lisa) is, some believe she was a rich Tuscan merchant\u2019s wife,\u201d she said, referring to a popular historical theory that proposes the figure was based on Italian noblewoman Lisa Gherardini. \u201cWhy did he put her in this wild, untamed environment? This is not Tuscany. What was he trying to tell us by putting this serene, enigmatic lady in this rugged, alpine environment?\u201d Said Pizzorusso. \u201cI\u2019m really intrigued as to what his message was to us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/style/mona-lisa-setting-italian-town-claim/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_style_new-miss-usa-crowned-hawaii-savannah-gankiewicz", "text": "Amid a dramatic two weeks of resignations and allegations made against the Miss USA organization, Miss Hawaii USA Savannah Gankiewicz \u2014 who had originally placed as the first runner-up at the 2023 Miss USA pageant \u2014 has stepped up to be crowned Miss USA. \u201cWhile this decision was not made lightly, I firmly believe that this opportunity was meant for me and I am ready to make a positive impact with this organization that I hold dear to my heart,\u201d said the 28-year-old, who was crowned by the governor of Hawaii Josh Green at a ceremony in Honolulu, Hawaii, on Wednesday. \u201cI am dedicated to taking action and making a difference. With my background as a certified mental health first aid responder and training in anti-bullying suicide prevention. I understand, the importance of prioritizing your well-being and advocating for those in need. I believe that the true change starts from within and I am determined to lead by example and empower the class of 2024 and beyond,\u201d she said, addressing a crowd in a hotel in Waikiki, a small aquarium in the background. Gankiewicz has taken over the title from Noelia Voigt, who suddenly gave up her crown earlier this month. Voigt cited her mental health as her reason for stepping down, but her resignation letter to the Miss Universe organization,\u00a0obtained\u00a0by CNN, accused CEO Laylah Rose, of \u201cactively building a culture of fear and control.\u201d Among her claims, she wrote that Miss USA management often failed to provide her with travel accommodations or an \u201ceffective handler,\u201d the latter leading to an instance where Voigt says she was sexually harassed during a Christmas parade in Sarasota, Florida, while alone with an unnamed person in a car. The Miss Universe organization and Rose, through Miss USA, did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Two days after Voigt\u2019s resignation, Miss Teen USA 2023 UmaSofia Srivastava relinquished her title as well, writing on Instagram that her values \u201cno longer fully align with the direction of the organization.\u201d In her first official appearance since the controversy, Rose did not address any of the allegations. She welcomed Gankiewicz to the Miss USA family telling her to \u201cembrace this moment of influence and let your words carry the power of positive change,\u201d and thanked her corporate partners and sponsors for their \u201cunwavering support.\u201d Rose said that this year\u2019s Miss Teen USA and Miss USA pageants would take place in Los Angeles and would broadcast on the CW network. The CW announced a multi-year agreement to air the two pageants in April, but in light of recent allegations, USA Today reported Monday that the network was \u201cevaluating\u201d its relationship with the Miss USA organization. The CW did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Tumult and turnover Currently, the Miss Teen USA role remains unfilled. The first runner-up from 2023, New York\u2019s Stephanie Skinner, declined to be crowned in a public statement on Instagram. On Tuesday, Voigt and Srivastava\u2019s mothers spoke out on \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d saying their daughters remained under strict non-disclosure agreements in their contracts and could not talk about their experiences. \u201cThe job of their dreams turned out to be a nightmare,\u201d Barbara Srivastava said. \u201cThe girls decided to step down and give (up) their dream of a lifetime \u2014 a crown, a national title. Why would two girls decide to give that up?\u201d During their reigning year, she added, their daughters were \u201cill-treated, abused, bullied and cornered,\u201d she added. Miss USA and Miss Universe Organization have not returned CNN\u2019s multiple requests for comment. Though many current Miss USA state titleholders expressed their public support on Instagram following Voigt\u2019s resignation, this week, the reigning Miss Colorado USA, Arianna Lemus, gave up her title completely. \u201cMy values were compromised. Silencing women is not the definition of pageantry,\u201d she told CNN on Wednesday. \u201cAs a collective, the 2023 (Miss USA) class came together in solidarity with Noelia, but that wasn\u2019t enough for me\u2026 and that\u2019s why I resigned.\u201d Gankiewicz will only hold the Miss USA title for a few months this summer, until a new contestant from the 2024 class of state titleholders takes the national crown in August at the next Miss USA pageant. On Instagram, she had acknowledged the limitations of her role, saying, \u201cWith the little time I have as Miss USA, it is my intention to bring attention and focus onto the rebuilding of Lahaina on my island of Maui. I also look forward to helping the 2024 delegates transition into a new era of Miss USA and supporting them on their own journeys towards the crown.\u201d Lemus, meanwhile, called on urgent action to protect 2024 titleholders and beyond from restrictive contracts. Voigt\u2019s mother, Jackeline Voigt, said on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d that contestants should reconsider competing at all. \u201cLook at what happened to Noelia and UmaSofia,\u201d she said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s not the right time to participate.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/style/new-miss-usa-crowned-hawaii-savannah-gankiewicz/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}

The supermodel, whose father is Palestinian-American real-estate developer Mohamed Hadid, drew praise from some on social media after she was pictured walking on the promenade in a dress by design duo Michael and Hushi. \u201cOur Palestinian princess,\u201d\u00a0wrote one user on X.\u00a0\u201cLoving this homage to her Palestinian roots,\u201d praised a separate user on Instagram, while another comment read, \u201cThis is fashion with purpose.\u201d The supermodel later reposted a picture of the dress with the caption \u201cFree Palestine forever\u201d in her stories on Instagram, where she is frequently vocal about violence against Palestinians and the ongoing war in Gaza. In October last year, she wrote in a statement posted to Instagram: \u201cMy heart is bleeding with pain from the trauma I am seeing unfold, as well as the generational trauma of my Palestinian blood,\u201d referencing those killed by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. And on May 15, Hadid marked Nakba Day (commemorating the time in 1948 when an estimated 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes)\u00a0with a post\u00a0sharing her family\u2019s history as Nakba survivors and pleading for an end to the war in Gaza. \u201cPlease look into the eyes of the Palestinians suffering,\u201d she wrote. The keffiyeh scarf, on which Hadid\u2019s dress is based, is worn across the Middle East. But in recent decades, it\u00a0has come to be identified as a symbol of Palestinian identity and resistance. Hadid\u2019s dress is from the archives of\u00a0Michael and Hushi, a New York-based brand founded by Michael Sears and Hushidar Mortezaie. The dress retailed for $900 in September 2001 and was featured in magazines including Women\u2019s Wear Daily and Wallpaper, according to an Instagram post by Mortezaie.  Some on social media were quick to point out that Hadid\u2019s dress was not technically a Palestinian\u00a0keffiyeh, with the colors more closely resembling those used in Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Mortezaie, one of the original designers, explained the intentions behind the dress. \u201cThis dress was made 23 years ago and everyone from the region was grouped as one big Other. There was no Google. Only what could be put together with little resources. Hopefully we can all learn to stand in unity and love against genocide,\u201d\u00a0he wrote on Instagram.

His young subjects are seen smoking cigarettes, lifting weights and trimming one another\u2019s hair. Other images show them hanging out in a grubby yard or lying around on mattresses. The photos were shot with the help of nine young Moroccans whom Beltr\u00e1n befriended in Seville, capital of the southern region of Andaluc\u00eda. Published in his new book \u201cDialect,\u201d the pictures were initially intended to be personal, not political. But they ultimately spoke to what Beltr\u00e1n called a \u201cKafka-esque\u201d system in which the men waited for years to learn whether their residency applications would be approved. \u201cAt the beginning, it was just about this group of guys,\u201d Beltr\u00e1n said on a video call from Madrid. \u201cBut of course, I realized that I was photographing these really specific political bodies, or political subjects in this bureaucracy.\u201d Last year, nearly 30,000 migrants arrived in Spain by sea, down from a record of over 58,000 in 2018, according to UNHCR data. Of these, most arrived in the Canary Islands or Andaluc\u00eda, a region separated from Morocco by the Strait of Gibraltar, a stretch of water just 13 kilometers (eight miles) at its narrowest. The nine men, who didn\u2019t previously know one another, were among those to arrive by boat during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic in search of a better life. Recounting his journey with an essay in \u201cDialect,\u201d one of Beltr\u00e1n\u2019s subjects, Youssef Elhafidi, recalls another terrified teen migrant being forced by smugglers to pilot their boat. \u201cHe did not want to drive, the fear was paralyzing him, they took out a knife and put it on his neck, threatening him to start the engines,\u201d Elhafidi wrote. \u201cThe boy started the machine between trembling and crying and we headed north.\u201d Killing time According to Beltr\u00e1n, his nine subjects were required to stay in Spain for three continuous years before applying for residency. Undocumented and without the right to work during this time, they were dependent on the state for food and housing. While living at the government-run facility, the men took Spanish lessons and joined workshops to help them adapt to life in Spain \u2014 some of which were run by Beltr\u00e1n. Overcoming an initial language barrier, the photographer began working with the group to produce images and videos. As well as candid portraits, the pictures focus on conditions at the facility, from peeling walls to basic food supplies. Many of the images were, however, staged. As Beltr\u00e1n looked for different ways to engage with his subjects, he asked them to re-enact moments from their respective migration journeys. In one, a subject lies motionless on blue gym mats, just as he had upon landing on Spain\u2019s coast. Another shows two of the men carrying a third on their shoulders to recreate the moment he fainted during a day-long walk to Seville from a small town to its south. The resulting book is thus part documentary and part performance, with Beltr\u00e1n toeing the line between mentor and collaborator, photographer and choreographer. More than just an artistic decision, staging photos directly responded to the tedium of the migrants\u2019 abundant free time. \u201cThere was an activity around taking the images \u2014 it was something during the day that (could get them) excited. And it was fun,\u201d Beltr\u00e1n recalled. \u201cEveryone was laughing, and they just make jokes each other during the sessions.\u201d Lost in translation When Beltr\u00e1n began delivering workshops at the facility in 2020, he was all too familiar with the system his subjects were trapped in. A few years earlier, he had relocated to Spain from his native Colombia, and \u2014 even as a college-educated Spanish speaker \u2014 also struggled to navigate the complex immigration processes. To illustrate the challenge facing his francophone subjects, his project included a video titled \u201cRecital\u201d in which they attempted to read the first four pages of the Spanish immigration law that would determine their futures. \u201cThey weren\u2019t understanding a word,\u201d he recalled, noting that, although lawyers were assigned to act on the men\u2019s behalf, the language barrier and dense legalese removed their agency. The opening pages of \u201cDialect\u201d \u2014 whose title alludes to these very linguistical challenges \u2014 are dedicated to stills from the video. Pictures of the men struggling to comprehend the legislation are overlaid with technical terminology (\u201cRight to effective judicial protection\u201d reads the text on one frame; another says, \u201cAuthorizations for the purpose of carrying out profit-making activities\u201d). \u201cThese legal procedures are really, really complicated, even for native speakers,\u201d said Beltr\u00e1n, who is now completing a PhD program in photography in Madrid. \u201cIt becomes almost like translation work \u2014 translating these laws and bureaucracies into (something understandable to) normal people like us.\u201d The result, he said, is an inevitable sense of helplessness. \u201cYou can\u2019t talk with anyone,\u201d Beltr\u00e1n added. \u201cYou can\u2019t ask, \u2018Who is the law?\u2019 or \u2018Who is the state?\u2019 You don\u2019t have anyone to approach. You don\u2019t have any tools to make a living\u2026 The system is built to avoid you, or to deny you access to (it).\u201d Describing the group as \u201cjust young people trying to figure out what to do with life,\u201d the photographer hopes his project can humanize migrants\u2019 experiences in a world increasingly desensitized to images of their suffering. Since Beltr\u00e1n completed his project, most of his subjects have completed their three-year wait and now formally reside in Spain, he says. He remains in touch with some \u2014 including Elhafidi, who he says works in a restaurant and has accompanied him at promotional events for the book\u2019s launch. In the conclusion of his essay, Elhafidi recalled how he felt when he secured his residency, writing: \u201cIt took me three years of searching and putting courage to life, until finally the moment came, after being cold, scared, hungry and the most difficult thing, my mother\u2019s tears\u2026 I got it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI got the papers. Now after getting it I have another look at life, I finally feel that I have the opportunity to be whoever I want to be.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re building their lives,\u201d Beltr\u00e1n said of those, including Elhafidi, who have secured residency. \u201cFortunately, they now can go back to Morocco to visit and see their families.\u201d \u201cDialect,\u201d published by Loose Joints, is available now.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/07/03/style/felipe-romero-beltran-dialect-spain-migration/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}

{"id": "style_article_moshe-safdie-architect-singapore", "text": "There are few buildings that have more drastically shaped a city\u2019s image than Marina Bay Sands. Just as the Eiffel Tower and Burj Khalifa define the skylines of Paris and Dubai, the soaring three-tower resort, joined across the top by a horizontal \u201cskypark\u201d and the world\u2019s most famous infinity pool, is an icon both in and of Singapore. In fact, the hotel-casino project is so successful that the man who designed it doesn\u2019t even stay there. \u201cIt\u2019s too noisy,\u201d said Israeli-Canadian architect Moshe Safdie. \u201cI\u2019m a swimmer and I can never get in the pool because there are so many people taking pictures.\u201d Now resuming his once-frequent trips to Singapore amid easing travel restrictions, Safdie prefers the nearby Ritz-Carlton, where we meet for afternoon tea. (\u201cI had a British mother,\u201d he explained, \u201cso I\u2019m a sucker for scones and tea.\u201d) At a top-floor table overlooking his best-known creation, he reflected on the sometimes-fraught task of designing contemporary landmarks. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t on my mind as much as it was on their minds,\u201d he clarified, recounting the call for design proposals issued by the city-state\u2019s government in the mid-2000s. \u201cThey didn\u2019t quite say the building should become the icon of Singapore, but they talked about it being iconic.  \u201cWhen we made the submission, I said, \u2018Some buildings have the magic to become memorable and associated with a place.\u2019 And I mentioned Sydney Opera House as the classic contemporary example. But, I said, \u2018It\u2019s a mystery what makes that happen.\u2019\u201d The trick, it transpired, was designing something striking yet simple. Constructing a 0.2-mile-long cantilevered roof terrace atop three skyscrapers required a feat of complex engineering but, at its most abstract, Marina Bay Sands can be sketched in four basic strokes. In Singapore Sign Language, the landmark is referenced by simply raising three fingers of one hand and resting another digit across the top. Visible for miles around, it appears on postcards and newscast backdrops. The structure also stars in the official Singapore Lego set, which the architect proudly displays at his office back in Somerville, Massachusetts.  \u201cThat kind of stuff, you can\u2019t quite plan for or design \u2013 it just happens,\u201d he said of the building\u2019s success. \u201cBut I\u2019m very happy about it. It changed our lives in terms of the work we get.\u201d  Safdie\u2019s eponymous firm is in high demand. In the years since Marina Bay Sands opened in 2010, he has realized almost 20 major projects. Among them are the serene Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas and a dual-tower residential complex in Colombo, Sri Lanka, that sees one high-rise lean dramatically against the other. The architect also bequeathed Singapore with another landmark in 2019: Jewel, a nature-themed entertainment and retail complex that attracts throngs of Instagrammers to Changi Airport each day thanks to its verdant indoor waterfall.  Safdie has said he considers seeing finished projects in use to be among an architect\u2019s greatest pleasures. He makes a point of visiting Jewel whenever he\u2019s in Singapore. \u201cI was concerned about how the plants were doing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I was relieved to see they\u2019re thriving.\u201d The architect is not in Singapore to indulge in past glories, however. In the days after our interview, he will inspect two new developments: a gardenesque office complex in the island\u2019s west and a pair of residential towers on the upmarket Orchard Road. The latter features multiple skybridges \u2013 a recurring theme in Safdie\u2019s work that was recently taken to new extremes in Chongqing, China, where he lay a gargantuan \u201chorizontal skyscraper\u201d (containing an infinity pool, restaurants and an indoor garden) atop four 820-foot-tall towers.   Then there is the small matter of Marina Bay Sands\u2019 second phase. The expansion plans feature, among other things, a fourth tower \u2013 though Safdie dismissed early suggestions that his iconic skypark might be extended to rest across its top. In any case, Singapore officials have expressed that he shouldn\u2019t, in his words, \u201cscrew around\u201d with an icon. Instead, the new tower will stand apart from the other three, forming \u201csort of an exclamation mark,\u201d he explained, motioning punctuative strokes: \u201cBoooom\u2026 boom.\u201d  Radical vision  At 84, Safdie shows little sign of slowing down. Other recent trips have taken him to Sao Paolo, Brazil, where his glass-roofed Albert Einstein Education and Research Center recently opened its doors, and to the Ecuadorian capital Quito, where his tree-covered Qorner Tower will do so later this year. Covid-19 eased the architect\u2019s unrelenting travel schedule, but he used the downtime to pen a memoir, \u201cIf Walls Could Speak: My Life in Architecture.\u201d He said he felt it was \u201ctime to document things.\u201d  Published this week, \u201cIf Walls Could Speak\u201d serves as a reminder that much of Safdie\u2019s six-decade career has been dedicated to humbler pursuits \u2013 museums, memorials and social housing that reimagined how people might live in densely populated cities.  Before Marina Bay Sands, his best-known project was his very first: Habitat 67, a radical 1960s housing development that saw hundreds of identical prefabricated concrete units stacked into clusters along Montreal\u2019s Saint Lawrence River. Safdie\u2019s dream that it would spark a wave of large-scale \u201cHabitats\u201d around the world proved overly optimistic. His attempts to repeat the feat in other cities, including New York, Toronto and Iran\u2019s capital Tehran, have often been thwarted. Projects of such size require land, funding and political will, and Safdie\u2019s book openly recounts times when all three were lacking. But the principles underpinning the experiment \u2013 that apartment dwellers should enjoy access to outdoor space, views in multiple directions and the opportunity to interact with nature and neighbors \u2013 defined his work thereafter. Born in 1938 in Haifa, then part of British-controlled Palestine, Safdie has credited much of this architectural ethos to his childhood. As a boy, he always lived in apartment buildings, first in a Bauhaus-style block on Haifa\u2019s Mount Carmel and then at his family\u2019s new home further up the hill. At the latter, he would enter via a bridge, while the famous Baha\u2019i Gardens \u201calmost functioned as my backyard,\u201d he writes in \u201cIf Walls Could Speak.\u201d One need not look far for the inspiration behind the skybridges and elevated urban gardens that have since characterized his oeuvre. Safdie moved to Canada with his parents aged 15. (In a neat turn of events, he departed Israel via Lod Airport, since renamed Ben Gurion Airport, where decades later he would design a terminal building.) It was in Montreal that Safdie decided to pursue architecture \u2013 and where he first grew his signature mustache. He attended the city\u2019s McGill University and wrote a college thesis, \u201cA Case for City Living,\u201d outlining his vision for a flexible housing \u201csystem\u201d that could be adapted to different contexts and climates. Those early ideas have long shaped Safdie\u2019s outlook. They would shape his fortunes, too. After showing his college drawings to the influential modernist Louis Kahn, he secured an apprenticeship at the architect\u2019s Philadelphia office. Soon after, he was offered the chance to put his ideas into practice at a scale unimaginable to most young graduates.  Montreal was due to host the 1967 World Fair, or Expo 67. Despite having never completed a building, the then 24-year-old Safdie was asked by the event\u2019s mastermind (and his thesis adviser), architect Sandy van Ginkel, to develop a master plan for the site. He was also tasked with building on his ideas, eventually proposing a village-sized development of some 1,200 prefabricated dwellings stacked 20 to 30 stories high. His meticulous placement of each factory-built module was calculated to maximize garden space, allow in sunlight and improve residents\u2019 views. Interconnected pedestrian walkways and bridges lifted the urban realm above ground.  Political and financial realities scaled back his design; the final Habitat 67 comprised just 154 apartments \u2013 made from 354 modules and stacked 12 stories high across three \u201cclusters.\u201d It was, nonetheless, a major statement. In a postwar world rethinking how to accommodate rapidly urbanizing populations, Safdie\u2019s system of repeated modular forms offered a bold new model for housing. Three of the 20th century\u2019s most important architects, I.M. Pei, Paul Rudolph and Philip Johnson, toured the project together prior to its opening. Only when Johnson told Safdie that he had \u201coutdone\u201d the classical Italian architect Giovanni Battista Piranesi did he realize the project \u201cwas a game changer,\u201d he recounted. Habitat 67 was not universally adored. A New Yorker cartoon, which Safdie also displays at his Boston office, poked \u201cgentle fun\u201d at the project by depicting a spade-wielding child stacking sand into similar formations. Various journalists and fellow architects were more barbed in their criticisms.  \u201cIt\u2019s strange that something so radical done by a young person gets so much crap thrown at it,\u201d Safdie mused. \u201cBut that\u2019s been true of my career.\u201d   \u2018For everyone a garden\u2019  To define Safdie\u2019s career by either his breakout success or the \u201cmegascale\u201d projects of recent years would be to ignore much else in between.  In the early 1970s, he opened an office in Jerusalem, a city whose urban fabric he has profoundly transformed. As well as designing major institutions like the Hebrew Union College and the Yad Vashem Holocaust History Museum, he oversaw a full-scale rebuild of the destroyed Jewish Quarter and planned an entirely new city, Modi\u2019in-Maccabim-Re\u2019ut, about 15 miles to its northwest. At one point, he even considered running for mayor of Jerusalem. He has also built widely in North America, where his output spans from the meditative (a nondenominational chapel at the Harvard Business School) to the mammoth (Terminal 1 of Toronto\u2019s Pearson Airport). A citizen of Israel, the US and Canada, Safdie may be best known in the latter for the National Gallery in Ottawa, a grand glass palace housing some of the country\u2019s most treasured art.  Despite earlier setbacks Safdie has, more recently, found fertile ground for his \u201cHabitats\u201d in Asia. In 2017, he completed the first phase of the sprawling Habitat Qinhuangdao \u2013 in the titular city, about 200 miles from Beijing \u2013 a series of 16-story \u201cmini blocks\u201d connected by garden bridges. Back in Singapore, Safdie\u2019s pixelated Sky Habitat tower saw him stretch his familiar stacked forms high above the ground to maximize floor space on a comparatively small plot. In both cases \u2013 and throughout Safdie\u2019s career \u2013 ideals articulated in the 1960s have been adapted to meet the realities of new sites and clients. Yet, the architect maintains that his approach to housing remains, fundamentally, the same. \u201cThe belief in apartments being rethought as houses, in having gardens for every apartment, in quality of life, in streets and communities and making buildings that belong to their culture \u2013 from the outset these were fundamental to my beliefs,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they haven\u2019t changed. If anything, they have reinforced themselves as years go by.\u201d \u201cI think, without bragging, there\u2019s been consistency,\u201d he added. \u201cIn fact, you could say I\u2019ve not been dynamic enough, but I\u2019ve been pretty consistent.\u201d  Idealism and compromise   There were other high-profile proposals that never came to fruition. Among the most divisive was the Columbus Center, a pair of heavy-set towers once set to loom over Manhattan\u2019s Central Park at Columbus Circle before plans were scrapped following 1987\u2019s Wall Street crash (and amid vociferous criticism from the likes of Henry Kissinger and Jacqueline Onassis).  But Safdie\u2019s legacy will not be measured only by what was, or wasn\u2019t, built. Many of the once-radical ideas he championed are now mainstream \u2013 something he can take an amount of credit for. For one, his fixation on plant life, a principle he dubbed \u201cfor everyone a garden\u201d in a 1974 book of the same name, is now widely shared by younger architects. Urban gardens and \u201cliving walls\u201d are now almost de rigueur for new large-scale developments.  Plants do not always thrive, though. In his memoir, Safdie distinguishes between \u201csignificant plant life\u201d and \u201csorry shrubs.\u201d So-called biophilic architecture may now be all the rage, but it can be undone by insufficient planning or maintenance, leaving occupants with dying trees and even bug infestations. As such, Safdie welcomes the trend while cautioning again token gestures. \u201cThe idea of green buildings is a battle cry \u2013 everyone is for it,\u201d he said. Making them work, however, is another matter altogether. \u201cThere\u2019s a cynicism about so many architects presenting buildings that are fairly conventional and then, in the renderings, everything is green and every balcony is oozing with trees. When you look (closer), you see there\u2019s no preparation for the earth, there\u2019s no depth \u2013 it\u2019s a fantasy.\u201d Prefabrication, championed by the architect since his college thesis, is also enjoying a renaissance. Just two miles away from Marina Bay Sands, for instance, a Singaporean design firm is overseeing two 630-foot-tall residential skyscrapers built from units constructed in a factory over the border in Malaysia.  \u201cFor a long time, people totally gave up on (prefabrication),\u201d Safdie said. \u201cBut now there is a real shortage of labor and skilled labor \u2013 not in China, because they\u2019ve got an extraordinary workforce, and not in India, but everywhere else in Southeast Asia, in Singapore, in the West. So, anything that is labor-saving is now up for grabs.\u201d Much else has changed since Safdie formed his architectural ideals. For one, he \u201cnever would have imagined\u201d how densely populated cities would become in the past 50 years. \u201cPrograms change, lifestyles change, priorities change and technologies change,\u201d the architect added.  But what about him? Has his outlook changed, too? \u201cMy daughter accused me of not being as idealistic as I was,\u201d the architect said. \u201cI disagree with her.\u201d Safdie is nonetheless aware that the lofty principles of his youth may not be shared by the casinos or corporate clients he often works for. Being an architect sometimes means serving \u201cregimes you\u2019re not in love with and business entities whose values are different to yours,\u201d he noted.  \u201cTake the dilemma I had with Marina Bay Sands,\u201d he said, motioning once more toward the window and our view of the complex from the Ritz-Carlton\u2019s lounge. \u201cOn the one hand, the idea of doing a building that could promote \u2018gaming\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s a nice word for it, but \u2018gambling\u2019 is the reality \u2013 is almost immoral if you go there and see poor people with limited means wasting their money.  \u201cBut, to me, that was 2% or 3% of the area of a project that\u2026 could show what the public realm could be in a city. And that took over from the issue that nagged me.  \u201cThat\u2019s compromise,\u201d he concluded. \u201cBut the basic value, the idealism of the end product, has not diminished. Without it, I don\u2019t know how you can be an architect.\u201d \u201cIf Walls Could Speak: My Life in Architecture,\u201d published by Grove Atlantic, is available now.", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/article/moshe-safdie-architect-singapore/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_style_india-elections-purple-voter-ink-intl-hnk", "text": "India\u2019s massive, twice-a-decade exercise in democracy is once again leaving its mark on the country\u2019s people, in the form of purple-streaked index fingers. The Election Commission uses indelible ink, or \u201cvoter ink\u201d, to prevent fraud or duplicate votes. Once a voter arrives at the booth to cast their ballot and has their ID verified, the ink is painted across the top of their left index finger, leaving a stain that can take up to two weeks to wash off. It may be rudimentary, but the method has been so effective that it\u2019s been in place for more than seven decades. \u201cRight from the prime minister to the most common person, everybody flashes their (marked) finger,\u201d said K Mohammed Irfan, managing director of Mysore Varnish and Paints Limited (MVPL), the state-owned company that exclusively makes and distributes the liquid to polling booths across the nation. \u201cFrom celebrities to film stars\u2026 (it has become) a mark of democracy that I think is synonymous with elections,\u201d he told CNN in a video interview. More than 960 million people are eligible to vote in India\u2019s election, the world\u2019s biggest. And workers at the company\u2019s factory in Mysuru, a city in southwestern Karnataka state, have spent months preparing nearly 2.7 million ink\u00a0vials, its largest order to date. The orange containers were filled and carefully packed for distribution ahead of this year\u2019s elections, which are underway and end\u00a0June 1. Each vial contains enough liquid to mark approximately 700 voters. The key to the ink\u2019s literal staying power? A tightly guarded formula which has remained unchanged since 1951. \u201cIndelible ink serves no other purpose,\u201d said Irfan. \u201cWe only manufacture the required quantity.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0While Irfan says the company is \u201cbound to secrecy\u201d when it comes to the ink\u2019s exact composition, it does contain the chemical compound silver nitrate, which causes a purplish stain when it comes into contact with skin and is exposed to sunlight. One dab at a time When newly independent India held its first-ever general elections in 1951 and 1952, organizers turned to the idea of using indelible ink to mark voters, in efforts to ensure a fair ballot. \u201cIn a country where there was no systematic registration of births, or identity documents, and with millions of people on the move as refugees, the question of how to prevent impersonation and double voting was a source of great concern,\u201d said Ornit Shani, author of \u201cHow India Became Democratic: Citizenship and the Making of the Universal Franchise.\u201d Some officials thought the method would take too much time and complicate the voting process, according to Shani, but public opinion eventually won out. \u201cCombined with the practice that all voters, irrespective of their caste, class and religions would stand in the same line, (having to wait) for their turn to have their finger marked (before they) cast their vote, further contributed to making concrete and visible the core value of the equality of the vote,\u201d Shani said in an email to CNN. \u201cOne man, one woman, one vote.\u201d Lasting appeal MVPL was founded as a paint supplier in 1937 by the then maharaja or ruler of Mysore, Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV, and retains that side\u00a0of its business. According to Irfan, when the company isn\u2019t producing ink, it\u2019s supplying, among other products, paint for the public transport sector. The ink\u2019s appeal has spilled beyond India\u2019s borders too. The company now supplies indelible ink to more than 35 countries, including to Ghana beginning in the late 1970s. However, Ghana\u2019s election commission recently announced it would phase out the use of indelible ink, opting for biometric verification methods instead. But the use of the ink in India doesn\u2019t appear to be going away any time soon. For Mukulika Banerjee, an associate professor of anthropology at the London School of Economics, the practice of marking a body may not translate well in other cultures, but it works in India due to common\u00a0cultural practices. \u201cPeople routinely have their hands decorated with henna, or women have their feet decorated with different colors,\u201d said Banerjee in a phone interview. \u201cI would argue that the marking of the finger (semi-permanently) kind of fits into it in a way that it might not fit in other contexts.\u201d She also pointed to an unintentional effect of marking voters with ink: creating an environment of peer pressure. Banerjee was able to find instances of this during her research on democracy and elections in West Bengal. \u201cFirst thing on polling day people do is check out each other\u2019s fingers,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if your left index finger is not carrying the indelible mark, they\u2019ll look at you and the first thing they\u2019ll say is \u2018Why haven\u2019t you voted?\u2019 \u201cYou can make excuses, but by the fifth time in the day, if somebody asks you and it gets so annoying, it\u2019s actually easier to go and vote than to not vote.\u201d The peer pressure extends to movie stars and athletes, who are likely to post their ink-stained fingers to their millions of fans on social media. \u201cThese guys have begun to hold up (their fingers) and take selfies of having voted and say \u2018I\u2019ve voted, have you?\u2019 because they feel they have a civic duty to encourage others to vote as well,\u201d she added. \u201cSo it becomes aspirational; then you want to be like your hero and you want to be able to do the same thing.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/india-elections-purple-voter-ink-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_style_elle-fanning-met-gala-balmain-lotw", "text": "To some, arriving at an important event naked is the stuff of nightmares. For others, it\u2019s a meticulously planned reality. For Elle Fanning, who showed up to Monday night\u2019s Met Gala in a completely transparent Balmain gown, it was the latter. Radiant, gleaming and gossamer, the actor looked like she was one false step away from shattering. According to Balmain, the frock\u2019s organza fabric was hand-covered with four layers of resin to achieve a glass effect. The resulting garment conjured images of the precious \u201ccrystalline flowers\u201d used to reverse the clock in JG Ballard\u2019s 1962 short story, \u201cThe Garden of Time\u201d (this year\u2019s Met Gala theme). But Fanning wasn\u2019t the only celebrity embracing a full-frontal look. Emily Ratajkowski, Kim Kardashian, Doja Cat, Phoebe Dyvenor, Greta Lee and even Eddie Redmayne all wore sheer outfits onto the red carpet, often with nothing but strategically placed embroidery or crystal embellishing to protect their modesty. Behold: The naked dress (or in Redmayne\u2019s case, naked suit). Designs that hint, some more subtly than others, at the wearer\u2019s nudity have become a mainstay on celebrity red carpets and runways. Doja Cat and Miley Cyrus both donned barely-there nude gowns at the Grammy Awards in February; while at the Oscars in March Jennifer Lawrence, Vanessa Hudgens, Florence Pugh, Kendall Jenner, Ice Spice, Charli XCX, Charlize Theron and Iris Law reminded us of the many varieties of a naked dress \u2014 from transparent lace to crystal netting. On the Spring-Summer 2024 catwalks, too, see-through skirts were spotted at almost every show, from Prada to Erdem, Acne Studios to Dior. But this preoccupation with sartorial teasing is not new. In 1962, Hollywood actor Carroll Baker was photographed in one of the first ever naked dresses \u2014 also designed by Balmain. Baker\u2019s breasts were covered (for the most part) with two embellished pasties sewn onto a sheer torso panel, while embroidered beads and sequins trimmed the sleeves, the neckline and covered the entire skirt. It was a custom look, created specifically for Baker by Pierre Balmain at his atelier in Paris. \u201c(Baker) particularly likes muslin dresses with sparkles placed at the critical points,\u201d wrote ELLE magazine in 1964. \u201cShe already has seven. Balmain just designed the 8th one.\u201d Today\u2019s abundance of nude gowns can sometimes make the red carpet look more like a Spencer Tunick photograph. But in the early days of these peek-a-boo garments, wearers still managed to ruffle a few feathers. Particularly in Baker\u2019s case, when she arrived one October evening at the Plaza cinema in London for the premiere of her latest film \u201cThe Carpetbaggers\u201d (1964). Her sheer Balmain dress turned heads \u2014 and generated headlines. \u201cCarroll goes to the show \u2014 almost topless,\u201d wrote British tabloid the Daily Mirror. \u201cIt\u2019s about as near as you can get to a topless dress without actually being topless.\u201d Balmain\u2019s \u201ctransparent\u201d dresses, as he called them, were some of the first high-fashion naked dresses to garner widespread attention (Yves Saint Laurent didn\u2019t create his first full-sheer look until 1966). In the 1960s, women\u2019s fashion in America and Europe was changing at a rapid pace thanks, in part, to the sexual liberation movement and the gradual introduction of the contraceptive pill. Mary Quant devised the scandalous mini skirt, while Edie Sedgwick rejected bottoms altogether \u2014 favoring instead an underwear and tights combo that is still referenced today. Although, Baker\u2019s barely-there dress may have been more than just a sign of the times. In 1964 \u2014 just a few months before her \u201ctopless\u201d moment at London\u2019s Plaza cinema \u2014 the New York Times called Baker \u201cthe most controversial female star in Hollywood,\u201d namely for her perceived comfort with on-screen nudity. Nudity was strictly censored in US films by the Production Code Administration, an independent body which relied on distributors to help enforce standards. After the Paramount Decrees in 1948 \u2014 a landmark ruling that forced companies such as Paramount, Fox, MGM and Warner Brothers to divest from theaters \u2014 cinemas were suddenly liberated from the thumb of powerful studios. By the 1960s, a nudity violation raised by the Production Code Administration meant a lot less than it did 20 years ago, as cinemas had the final decision on whether to run the film or not. Baker, according to the New York Times, had become \u201ca major target of heated arguments about nudity in American films.\u201d The actor responded nonchalantly and almost prophetically, \u201cI believe that in the next 10 years nudity will be accepted in movies\u2026 I do not think movie nudity will injure the national character.\u201d So while the press and wider world fizzed at Baker\u2019s on-screen state of undress, she decided to do one better, and give them a glimpse of the real thing. While Fanning\u2019s look was markedly less controversial than Baker\u2019s, it proved that even after six decades, the naked dress is still as relevant as ever.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/style/elle-fanning-met-gala-balmain-lotw/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_style_hank-willis-thomas-loverules-advert-culture", "text": "In Seattle\u2019s Henry Art Gallery,\u00a0an open, oval room is covered wall-to-wall in women, the visuals spanning a full century from 1915 to 2015. The artist Hank Willis Thomas is pointing to one of the images: of two well-dressed, neatly coiffed men standing atop a cliff. Below them, a woman is hanging from the peak with a rope. \u201cAnyone want to guess what this is an ad for?\u201d he asks a group previewing his latest show, \u201cLOVERULES,\u201d on the afternoon of its opening day. \u201cSweaters?\u201d someone posits. Somehow, they\u2019re correct. The piece is from Thomas\u2019 largest body of work, \u201cUnbranded: A Century of White Women.\u201d The 2015 series \u2014 one of many resurfaced for the \u201cLOVERULES\u201d\u00a0exhibit \u2014 features 101 print adverts (one ad per year), from which Thomas has removed the relevant logos and copy, inviting the viewer to reckon with historical records of femininity and its commodification. The aforementioned image \u2014 for Drummond Sweaters \u2014 was initially printed in a 1959 issue of \u201cEsquire\u201d magazine. A chorus of scoffs echo throughout the gallery room as Thomas reads its original text: \u201cMen are better than women! Indoors, women are useful \u2014 even pleasant. On a mountain they are something of a drag.\u201d \u201cLOVERULES\u201d threads together Thomas\u2019 most significant practices and themes, particularly the impact of corporate branding, the construction of gender and race, and the evolution of power struggles across movements for liberation. \u201cWhat does it mean to look at an object that was made to have a three to six month shelf life 40 years later?\u201d Thomas asked, speaking about the show with CNN. For those in the gallery room, it means discomfort or even disgust when considering an image of a woman with mascara running down her eyes and what looks like a black eye, for example, or another stripped of her clothing surrounded by a group of men. (The former came from a 1963 ad for Tareyton cigarettes, appearing to make light of domestic abuse in its call for \u201caggressive loyalty\u201d from customers; the latter, in its troubling depiction of what a viewer could all too easily interpret as men preparing to sexually assault a woman, is for pants.) Throughout the \u201cUnbranded\u201d series, the viewer is confronted with the values embedded in the ethos of advertising \u2014 namely, capitalism and the ways in which those who fuel it will tokenize groups and ideas for profit. \u201cWhat is expected of us is very much informed by advertising, which typically has a specific agenda,\u201d Thomas told CNN. (In other words, buying into the inferiority of women helped sell those sweaters or cigarettes.) Over the last 20 plus years, Thomas has made a name for himself responding to culturally ingrained narratives of race, gender, class and their intersections in the United States through various mediums \u2014 from photo to fabric. Whether he\u2019s mirroring a three-point stanced football player with an enslaved person picking cotton in \u201cThe Cotton Bowl,\u201d or mimicking a maze made out of prison uniforms and American flag fabric in \u201cJustice,\u201d Thomas\u2019 work successfully identifies patterns of oppression and asks us to consider how we participate in these systems. In the complementary series, \u201cUnbranded: Reflections in Black by Corporate America,\u201d Thomas explores ways in which brands invest in or give attention to certain (and often marginalized) communities when it becomes financially convenient \u2014 in this case, the corporate appropriation of Black culture. \u201cSomewhere around the late \u201960s, I believe as a result of heightened visibility through the Civil Rights movement, corporations started to pay attention,\u201d Thomas explained of the series that assesses ads from 1968 to 2008 (and was intentionally capped when Barack Obama was elected).\u00a0Before then, he continued, \u201cpeople of color weren\u2019t seen as a worthwhile demographic to market to, or to represent.\u201d Both \u201cUnbranded\u201d series assess advertisements as a channel for understanding the place (and power) of racism and sexism throughout American history. Thomas\u2019 visual reflections of popular culture\u2019s past demand an analysis of how corporations commodify belief systems for their own gain \u2014 and, in many cases, walk back or even denounce those same beliefs should their profit stumble. (Any focus on queer life ends after a Pride campaign, say, or the celebration of Black stories stops after February sales \u2014 in other words, investment in the bottom line will always supersede investment in people or movements.) To Thomas, these tactics have become even more deceptive as ads have evolved beyond still frames. \u201cWith influencers and product placement, (this messaging) is a lot more subtle, more insidious,\u201d he argued. \u201cWe\u2019re consuming advertising information without even necessarily knowing it.\u201d Even in instances when many of us are well aware of the manipulative tactics employed by brands, that doesn\u2019t always stop us from buying in. In his series \u201cB\u00aeanded,\u201d part of which is also included in \u201cLOVERULES,\u201d Thomas merges brand logos with altered photos or backdrops to examine how we are beholden to corporations: an Amex that reads \u201cThe Afro-American Express,\u201d its central photo of enslaved people crowded on a ship. Close by is an image of a chest covered in scars in the shape of Nike\u2019s logo, speaking to, as Thomas shared, \u201chow slaves were branded as a kind of ownership, and (how) today we brand ourselves.\u201d Also featured are two of his works reconfiguring the classic Absolut bottle silhouette, one of which resembles the Door of No Return, the symbolic gateway found in S\u00e9negal\u2019s Gor\u00e9e Island, known as the largest warehouse of enslaved Africans before they were forced onto ships abroad. Reimagined as artworks, these advertisements are what Thomas deems \u201cmessages to the future\u201d and epitomize the more platformed desires and tropes of their time. It begs the question, what of today\u2019s visual messages that we have accepted as normal should, in 40 years time, be interrogated and chastised?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/style/hank-willis-thomas-loverules-advert-culture/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "style_greg-girard-kowloon-walled-city-snap", "text": "It was the summer of 1989. Hong Kong\u2019s humidity \u2013 already oppressive \u2013 was intensified\u00a0in the dark, maze-like alleyways of an unruly enclave known as Kowloon Walled City. Then the most densely populated place on Earth, its buildings were packed together so tightly that barely a slither of sky was visible from the ground. Searching for a moment of respite from the heat and chaos below, photographer Greg Girard found himself on the roof of one of the enclave\u2019s many illegally-built high-rises among a tangled thicket of television antennas. He wasn\u2019t alone. In the Walled City, the delineation of private and public spaces \u201cwasn\u2019t always so clear,\u201d Girard recalled in a video call, adding that the roof was an escape for many of its residents to relax, do laundry or watch planes land at Kai Tak International Airport. \u201cOnce you get up to the rooftop, everything sort of changes. The vista opens up, and it\u2019s cooler, there\u2019s a breeze.\u201d Navigating the narrow gaps between buildings with planks of wood, children would skip and play between the webs of laundry lines and satellites.\u00a0\u201cNo one seemed to think of it as a dangerous place, even though there were no guardrails or anything like that,\u201d said Girard. On that particular summer day, some children spotted Girard\u2019s camera and approached him. When he turned the lens on them, they began performing and pulling faces. He snapped several shots, describing the final one, which he eventually chose to publish, as the moment when they had \u201csettled into this face-off with me.\u201d In the photograph a young girl, barefoot and wearing a blue dress, stares into the camera. Her face is relaxed and her hands are wrapped around an antenna pole as if she\u2019s about to swing. In the backdrop, her friend strikes a defiant stance, hands on her hips, while another is in the throes of messing around, bent double in a playful squat. \u201cI thought (the image) captured the kids\u2019\u00a0indifference to the potential danger \u2026 of the rooftop, while at the same time sort of owning their territory and confronting me while goofing around,\u201d said Girard, adding: \u201cIt was just quite an average day up on (there).\u201d The playfulness of the children, juxtaposed with the jagged antennas and stark concrete of their surroundings, seem to epitomized the spirit of Kowloon Walled City, the photographer said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an ideal playground but that never seemed to bother anyone \u2014 which was, of course, very much the spirit of the Walled City: making the best of, and even enjoying life in, a situation most other people would be horrified by.\u201d A \u2018strange, vertical village\u2019 Girard first visited Kowloon Walled City in 1986 while on a shoot at the nearby airport. At that time, around 350 buildings, up to 14 stories high, were packed precariously into a space of 0.01 square miles. Most of the towers were built without proper foundations or regard for safety codes. \u201cThis strange, vertical village wasn\u2019t really supposed to exist,\u201d said Girard, explaining the Kowloon Walled City was the product of a historical and political quirk. Although the enclave was situated in the middle of Hong Kong, then a British colony, imperial officials refused to take legal responsibility for it. As such, the Walled City remained technically subject to Chinese rule, though this was never enforced. \u201cThat allowed it to become something you couldn\u2019t have dreamed up,\u201d Girard added. Existing in ambiguity for nearly a century, it had a reputation for illicit dealings and was infamous for its triads, drug dens, brothels and unlicensed dentistry. But by the time the Canadian photographer made his first visit to the \u201cthriving\u201d city in 1986, triad control had waned and these characterizations were, he said, \u201cvery out of date.\u201d \u201cIt might have been true at one time,\u201d he added. But his enduring memory of the place was the community that lived there. \u201cYou quickly realize that it\u2019s just a place where folks are trying to get by, like any other working-class part of Hong Kong.\u201d Girard was determined to demystify the so-called \u201cCity of Darkness,\u201d particularly after the colonial government announced plans in 1987 to demolish it. He spent four years documenting the Walled City with fellow photographer Ian Lambot, with the pair eventually publishing a book of their images in 1999. Early on, Girard decided to photograph the series in color and used portable lighting equipment \u2014 similar to the kind he used to capture celebrities and CEOs for glossy magazine portraits. \u201cThe only pictures you saw of the Walled City at the time tended to be in black and white, and they made the place look as bad as possible, in keeping with the reputation of the Walled City as a dangerous, squalid slum,\u201d said Girard. When it came to capturing people\u2019s day-to-day lives, and images of residents, shopkeepers and factory owners, the photographer wanted to use \u201ca more even-handed approach,\u201d he added. Girard documented, among much else, the blurred chaos of noodle and fish ball factories, a young child inspecting his grazed knee on the counter of his family\u2019s grocery store, and a barber curling a client\u2019s hair. While initial reactions to his presence were often frosty (\u201cthere was a palpable unwelcomeness to outsiders,\u201d he recalled), residents eventually allowed him into their cramped apartments. His guiding principle, Girard said, was \u201cto try to show it for what it really was, since rumor and myths were the only things that were known about the place.\u201d Imagined dystopias When the Walled City was razed, from 1993 to 1994, that was supposed to be the end of it. But in the decades since, the enclave has arguably garnered more interest than it ever did while standing. In 2014, Girard and Lambot published a \u201crevisited\u201d edition of their book that explored the city\u2019s legacy in popular culture \u2014 including as an inspiration for fictional dystopias in video games and films, such as \u201cCall of Duty: Black Ops\u201d and \u201cBatman Begins.\u201d \u201cThe Walled City was this jumping-off point for an imaginary city where the normal rules don\u2019t apply,\u201d said Girard. There has been renewed interest in architectural circles, too: The unregulated, organic construction that made Kowloon Walled City a \u201cdystopia\u201d to live in is now being examined as a source of innovation due to its resourceful use of limited space and cheap or second-hand materials, said Girard. \u201cThe limitations of that place certainly spurred a lot of creative responses, in building terms, to (the question of) what to do in a place that no one cares about, or pays attention to, except the residents,\u201d Girard added. The site of the Walled City has since been transformed into a public park, which opened in 1995. Quiet and uncrowded, it is in many ways the opposite of what it replaced, providing a much-needed reprieve from the clamor of a city desperately short on public space. Open-air chess pavilions and banyan-shaded ponds surround the old yamen building, a relic of the 19th-century Chinese garrison city that once stood on the site and the only structure to survive the demolition. Inside the building, Girard\u2019s famous rooftop photo is blown-up to fill an entire wall, accompanied by an audio track of children laughing and the roar of airplane engines. The memory of a vibrant community \u2014 immortalized by photographers like Girard \u2014 lingers. Ongoing interest in the Walled City is, Girard suggests, because of the spirit it encapsulates: the aptitude for survival even in the harshest of circumstances. \u201cIt still continues to fascinate,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s wonderful.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/greg-girard-kowloon-walled-city-snap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM.

{"id": "2024_04_17_style_copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl", "text": "Police launched an investigation Wednesday into the fire that tore through Copenhagen\u2019s famous stock exchange building, causing the collapse of its spire and damaging centuries-old artwork and architecture. The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through\u00a0the building \u2013 known locally as B\u00f8rsen \u2013\u00a0from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen\u00a0police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a \u201ccomplicated process.\u201d Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already \u201cconducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.\u201d \u201cBut of course, there is still a lot to do, especially as we have not yet had the opportunity to examine\u00a0B\u00f8rsen itself,\u201d Belling added. The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. \u201cMy first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be the same but it\u2019s iconic to\u00a0Copenhagen\u00a0and Denmark,\u201d teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters. Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, told the news agency that a firefighter gave him the top of the spire on Wednesday morning after it was recovered following its fall. \u201cIt gives me hope because we have decided to rebuild the stock exchange because it\u2019s part of European history as a trading continent,\u201d he said. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. It has been at the heart of Danish business since then; while it no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, it serves as the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday a \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d was on fire, calling the building \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt added that 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/17/style/copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}

The 3.3 million square-meter Al Khuwair Muscat Downtown and Waterfront development will include a residential complex, a marina, a cultural district, numerous canal walkways and a ministerial campus. Work is set to start at the end of this year and the area is expected to house more than 60,000 people when completed. ZHA\u2019s associate director, architect Paolo Zilli, told CNN he spent around a year finalizing the model he presented to Oman\u2019s Ministry of Housing and Urban Planning. Central to ZIlli\u2019s design was facilitating access to public transport. \u201cThe vision is actually to remove all the cars, to remove all the fences and to create a campus of the ministry with many functions that can attract families and a new generation,\u201d he said.

{"id": "style_brutalist-plant-photos-c2e-spc", "text": "Austere. Stark. Cold. The common opinions about Brutalist architecture are a far cry from the way we often describe the natural world: lush, colorful, verdant. But a new photobook is exploring nature\u2019s relationship with Brutalist architecture \u2014 from a theater in Japan to a library in Canada \u2014 and finding beauty in the contrast. Called \u201cBrutalist Plants,\u201d the book is a \u201cmix of looking into the future but also looking back,\u201d said Olivia Broome, curator of the book and creator of the @brutalistplants Instagram community of more than 30,000 followers. Broome hopes the images will inspire people to look at the built environment differently \u2014 and see it as a place that can complement nature. \u201cEither we all exist in harmony with nature and concrete, or we all mess it up so badly that nature is going to overtake everything that we build,\u201d she said. Dystopia or utopia? Brutalism, sometimes referred to as \u201cNew Brutalism,\u201d is an architectural style typified by its imposing form, use of geometric shapes and clean lines, exposed concrete, and monochromatic color schemes. Its popularity peaked between the 1950s and \u201870s and it\u2019s commonly associated with the UK and Eastern Europe, but this international style has its roots in much earlier 20th-century structures from around the world, particularly those of Swiss architect Le Corbusier, whose work prioritized functionality and large, sculptural shapes. Born in the UK, Broome grew up in Geneva, Switzerland, which first sparked her interest in Brutalism. \u201cWhere I grew up, there were a lot of mountains and concrete,\u201d she said, adding that in Geneva there were a lot of buildings by Le Corbusier: \u201cLooking back, (Brutalist buildings) feel like a homely space for me.\u201d The \u201cBrutalist Plants\u201d platform started as a hobby: Broome shared images on Tumblr before she moved it to Instagram in 2018. The account reposts the work of photographers, with tags and credits, and as the community has grown into the tens of thousands, many photographers and content creators now submit work to her. Broome was attracted to the images because of the contrast of the cold concrete with the softness of nature, which has an ambiguous \u201cdystopian or utopian feel.\u201d \u201cA lot of them are quite modernist, which is a bit more like a utopia,\u201d said Broome. Some of the photos imagine \u201chow we could be living, with plants or balconies,\u201d and the inclusion of architectural renders and AI-generated scenes show hopeful visions of our stark urban world co-existing peacefully alongside nature. On the flip side, some of them have a darker feeling. \u201cThere are a few images in there where it\u2019s genuinely overgrown architectural spaces that no longer exist,\u201d she said, adding that many were submitted by urban explorers of abandoned buildings. People are notably absent from the photos; most of the images are only of architecture and nature, but in a few instances, Broome said humans have been removed from the images to focus the narrative on the built environment\u2019s relationship with nature, which Broome feels is muddled by human presence. \u201cNobody lives in the book, really. There are no human beings. It\u2019s just plants doing their thing,\u201d she added. Controversial structures Featuring 150 photos of buildings, artworks and sculptures, the book includes a mix of images shared on the Instagram account and unseen photos sourced elsewhere, said Broome. With 41 countries featured in the book, Broome is excited to show the huge spread and variety of Brutalist works, and the architectural style\u2019s influence on more recent structures and artworks. One of the \u201cmost contested images\u201d Broome shared with her audience on Instagram, which has also made the cut for the book, is of a sculpture by German artist Karsten Fo\u0308dinger. \u201cIt\u2019s this slab of concrete that sits slightly slanted, held up by pine trees in a row. It kind of looks like a table of concrete that\u2019s attached to these trees,\u201d explained Broome. Online, some people commented it was \u201cawful for the trees\u201d and an affront to nature, while others felt the unity of concrete and wood \u2014\u00a0commonly used in house building \u2014 reflected ideas of shelter and put an artistic twist on it. \u201cThere was a lot of debate back and forth,\u201d said Broome. A lot of the images hold special meaning for Broome: a photograph of a building in Geneva is \u201ctwo minute\u2019s walk\u201d from where her father lives, and some of the buildings photographed in Melbourne and Canberra in Australia are places she\u2019s visited with family and friends. Broome, who moved back to London to study design and journalism at university, now lives in the UK where there are many Brutalist buildings to provide inspiration \u2014\u00a0including the Barbican Theatre, where the book will be launched. She believes Brutalist structures should be preserved for the future \u2014 and the integration of nature shows their adaptability. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of Brutalist (architecture) that is endangered because people don\u2019t see the value,\u201d she said. \u201c(But) there are more architects, and some feature in the book, that are working to make brutalism more accessible and more beautiful, and really showcase what it can do for different spaces.\u201d Brutalist Plants, published by Hoxton Mini Press, is out on May 16, 2024", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/brutalist-plant-photos-c2e-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}

In an Instagram post Wednesday, Miss Teen USA UmaSofia Srivastava said her \u201cpersonal values no longer fully align with the direction of the organization.\u201d \u201cAfter months of grappling with this decision, I have made the choice to resign from the title of Miss Teen USA 2023,\u201d wrote Srivastava in a statement on her personal account. The high school teen from New Jersey won the pageant back in September and had expressed her pride at being the first Mexican-Indian American to hold the role. \u201cI look forward to the rest of the year as I finish 11th grade as part of the National Honor Society and start the college application process, knowing that my academic career has been defined by my hard work, and my hard work alone,\u201d she added. She said she would continue her advocacy for education and acceptance alongside work with the Lotus Petal and Bridge of Books foundations. The pageant responded with an Instagram post, writing that it respected Srivastava\u2019s decision, considered the well-being of titleholders \u201ca top priority,\u201d and that a successor would be named soon. Srivastava and the Miss Universe and Miss USA organizations did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Her resignation comes on the heels of another queen relinquishing her title earlier this week.  On Monday, Noelia Voigt stepped down from her Miss USA title, citing her mental health. When she took the crown in November, Voigt, who is Venezuelan American and from Utah, said she would work to connect with diverse communities across the United States. \u201cDeep down I know that this is just the beginning of a new chapter for me, and my hope is that I continue to inspire others to remain steadfast, prioritize your mental health, advocate for yourself and others by using your voice, and never be afraid of what the future holds, even if it feels uncertain,\u201d she posted on Instagram. \u201cNever compromise your physical and mental well-being. Our health is our wealth,\u201d she wrote. Her post drew speculation from fans that Voigt was sending a hidden message about a non-disclosure agreement, with the first letter of the first 11 sentences of her statement spelling out \u201cI am silenced.\u201d A spokesperson for the Miss USA Organization told CNN in a statement on Monday that they supported Voigt\u2019s decision to step down from her duties and that \u201cthe well-being of our titleholders is a top priority, and we understand her need to prioritize herself at this time.\u201d The organization added they are reviewing plans for the \u201ctransition of responsibilities to a successor\u201d and that they will announce the new Miss USA soon. The resignations, along with the organization\u2019s social media director Claudia Michelle also stepping down last week, have raised questions among fans around the culture of beauty pageants and whether aspects are in need of an overhaul. Michelle has been more candid about alleged problems at the organization. In an Instagram post she wrote she disavows \u201cworkplace toxicity and bullying of any kind.\u201d Miss Universe and Miss USA did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Some of Voigt\u2019s fellow Miss USA contestants shared a post claiming that \u201cthe majority\u201d of the 2023 class supported her decision to leave and asked the Miss USA Organization to release Voigt from her NDA clause \u201cso that she is free to speak on her experiences.\u201d  ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/style/umasofia-srivastava-miss-teen-usa-resignation-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "style_article_sunil-gupta-india-gate-snap", "text": "To passersby, the sight of two men embracing besides New Delhi\u2019s India Gate in 1986 might have seemed unremarkable. In a city where public displays of platonic male affection are relatively commonplace, it was photographer Sunil Gupta who attracted more attention at the time. \u201cMen holding hands or lying in each other\u2019s laps is not an issue \u2014 it looks very romantic from (the outside), but they\u2019re usually just hanging out,\u201d he said in a video interview from the UK, before recalling: \u201cI was creating more interest than them, because I was standing there with a tripod and a camera, so everybody was focused on me.\u201d Onlookers may not have realized, but Gupta was creating a subtly subversive image in what he has described as the \u201crepressive atmosphere\u201d of 1980s India. At a time when homosexuality was more taboo in the country than it is today \u2014 and with consensual gay sex then criminalized as an \u201cunnatural offense\u201d \u2014 the photographer had found his subjects via the informal networks constituting Delhi\u2019s gay scene. The pair in question had chosen the war monument\u2019s gardens for their photo shoot due to its reputation as a cruising spot.  Having lived in New Delhi until his mid-teens, London-based Gupta knew this from personal experience. \u201cI passed that place on my way to school every day for 11 years,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just had to hop off the bus and get laid on your way home. It was very easy.\u201d The image forms part of the photographer\u2019s series \u201cExiles,\u201d which was first exhibited in the UK in 1987 but is this week showing at the India Art Fair in New Delhi. Primarily shot outdoors around India\u2019s capital, it captures gay men sat on benches or in public places popular among those looking for casual sexual partners, their faces often out of shot or turned away from the camera. Concerned about \u201couting\u201d his subjects, Gupta treated them as collaborators in what he called a \u201cconstructed documentary\u201d approach. After shooting his images and developing the film in London, he returned to Delhi with printed contact sheets to ensure the men were comfortable with the pictures he selected for his show. \u201cThere was quite a bit of horsing around in the pictures,\u201d he said of the India Gate shoot. \u201cAnd there were other photos that were (more suggestive)\u2026 So I picked a somewhat tamer one to put in the series.\u201d The other ethical challenge, he recalled, was communicating to the duo how the images would be used \u2014 and the art of photography itself. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t for publication, and the only way they saw pictures was in a magazine, so it took some explaining,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThen I tried to explain the process.\u201d Photography for many at the time, Gupta observed, was still \u201ca very mysterious thing that only a few people did in a darkroom.\u201d   For \u2018the canon\u2019  Now among India\u2019s most celebrated photographic artists, Gupta often addressed LGBTQ experiences in his explorations of race, immigration and identity. While studying in the US in the mid-1970s he produced a now-celebrated series of photos from New York\u2019s Christopher Street that captured the city\u2019s gay scene in the years between the Stonewall Riots and onset of the AIDS epidemic. Although \u201cExiles\u201d presented a rare portrait of gay life outside the West, Gupta\u2019s intended audience was always back in London. Homophobia was rife in 1980s Britain, and the photographer said he faced \u201ca lot of hostility\u201d at art school for making work relating to his sexuality. \u201cI couldn\u2019t make gay work, and I couldn\u2019t make gay work about India, especially,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was none in the library for reference. So, I thought, \u2018I\u2019m making it my mission to make some. Not for India, but for this canon \u2014 we need to have gay Indian guys in our library, in our art schools, over here.\u2019\u201d New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art has since acquired several of the pictures for its permanent collection, signifying the series\u2019 place in contemporary photography. But it was not an instant success. \u201cIt didn\u2019t have any impact when it was first shown,\u201d Gupta said of its debut.  \u201cI think it was too early.\u201d By the 1990s, however, interest in Gupta\u2019s work was growing, as art made by, and about, gay people of color became increasingly visible in the West. The fact that \u201cExiles\u201d is now showing in India, where he said it is positively received, is testament to changes on the subcontinent, too.  Although the country\u2019s LGBTQ communities still face significant social stigma, gay sex was decriminalized in 2018 and the arrival of apps like Grindr have been transformative, Gupta said. (\u201cThose sorts of chance meetings behind the bush are not happening \u2014 or maybe happening less,\u201d he added). This modern context and the power of hindsight have helped paint the photos in a new light. \u201cI think it has become historical enough that people are curious about what gay life was like before Grindr and the internet,\u201d Gupta said. \u201cPeople think it was all doom and gloom, and people jumping off buildings. They don\u2019t seem to appreciate that we also managed to have some kind of a life back then.\u201d This is a message reflected in the photographer\u2019s carefree India Gate shoot, which he recounts as a relaxed day of fun and abundant sunlight. \u201cIt just seemed very pleasurable. It was a nice day out, and I got to hang out with these guys who were having a good time and having a laugh.\u201d \u201cExiles\u201d is showing via Vadehra Art Gallery at India Art Fair, which runs February 9-12 in New Delhi, India. A book of outtakes from the series, published by Aperture, is available now.", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/article/sunil-gupta-india-gate-snap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}

Yet almost two years after her death, new pictures of Britain\u2019s longest-reigning monarch have emerged for an exhibition opening at Buckingham Palace this week. Among the most striking is a touching image from 1964 of four royal mothers and their babies - including the Queen and her youngest son, Prince Edward. Alongside them are the Queen\u2019s sister, Princess Margaret, plus Princess Alexandra and the Duchess of Kent, all holding their newborn babies. The never-before-seen image was taken by Princess Margaret\u2019s then-husband, photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones - or Lord Snowdon as he was known as then - as a personal thanks for the royal obstetrician who delivered the four babies within two months of that year. Shown alongside it is a handwritten letter from Princess Margaret to her sister in which she asks \u201cDarling Lilibet\u201d to sign a print \u201cas a souvenir of an extraordinary two months of delivery.\u201d \u201cRoyal Portraits: A Century of Photography,\u201d which opened in The King\u2019s Gallery of the palace on Friday, has more than 150 items from the Royal Collection and Royal Archives, which chart the evolution of royal portrait photography since the 1920s. Also on show for the first time are several wartime images taken by Cecil Beaton, who captured the royal family on camera over six decades. Among them is one of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth inspecting bomb damage at the palace in 1940, while another shows them with their two daughters - Elizabeth and Margaret - around the King\u2019s desk at the Royal Lodge in Windsor. Beaton was the official photographer for Elizabeth\u2019s coronation in 1953. The exhibition features a contact sheet of proofs of the coronation sitting, alongside a note from Martin Charteris, the Queen\u2019s assistant private secretary, recommending to Prince Philip which images should be sent to the royal family and maids of honor. The picture that was subsequently chosen and sent to the Queen Mother can also be seen, signed by both the Queen, her husband and Beaton. In a week where many headlines were made about the new official painting of the King, the exhibition offers an altogether different view of Charles. It features a black and white shot of Charles, then a young prince, alongside his sister, Princess Anne, in 1956. There are numerous official photographs taken to mark royal birthdays, including a portrait by Beaton of Princess Margaret for her 25th birthday - together with her dog Pippin.  Separately, she and her sister, the Queen, can be seen laughing and talking in a contact sheet of images shot by Norman Parkinson on the occasion of their mother\u2019s 80th birthday. Another highlight is the earliest surviving color print of a member of the royal family. Taken in 1935 by pioneering female photographer Madame Yevonde, it shows Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester - sister-in-law to King George VI and Edward VIII - on her wedding day. The exhibition, which runs until October, charts the innovations in portraiture, featuring Andy Warhol\u2019s 1985 image of the Queen sprinkled with diamond dust and Rankin\u2019s 2001 photograph of the smiling monarch, superimposed against the union flag. Meanwhile, Paolo Roversi\u2019s memorable 40th birthday portrait of the Princess of Wales, shows Catherine bearing a striking resemblance to Alexandra, Princess of Wales, by Franz Xaver Winterhalter in 1864. Curator Alessandro Nasini said in a press release: \u201cThe Royal Collection holds some of the most enduring photographs ever taken of the Royal Family, captured by the most celebrated portrait photographers of the past hundred years \u2013 from Dorothy Wilding and Cecil Beaton to Annie Leibovitz, David Bailey, and Rankin. \u201cAlongside these beautiful vintage prints, which cannot be on permanent display for conservation reasons, we are excited to share archival correspondence and never-before-seen proofs that will give visitors a behind-the-scenes insight into the process of creating such unforgettable royal portraits.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/style/unseen-photos-royal-family-gbr-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_style_tim-hetherington-photography-snap", "text": "At an outpost in Afghanistan\u2019s eastern Korengal Valley, in the midst of a heightened American military campaign against the Taliban, two soldiers appear to be fighting \u2014 each other. It\u2019s a play fight and the young man on the bottom has his comrade in a headlock, forcing a kiss on the cheek. The photograph, taken in 2008 by the late British photographer Tim Hetherington, is from a time when nearly a fifth of all combat in Afghanistan was taking place in the six-mile valley. In the long stretches of boredom that would arise when the enemy was nowhere to be found, the men had to find other things to do at their remote outpost. \u201cThese guys are tough, aggressive guys and when there wasn\u2019t any combat, they turned their aggression on each other \u2014 in a fraternal way,\u201d explained Sebastian Junger, a writer and journalist who first brought Hetherington to Afghanistan on an assignment for Vanity Fair magazine in 2007. Both Hetherington and Junger became \u201cenamoured with the opportunity to show the intimacy of a platoon in combat,\u201d Junger said in an interview via telephone. The pair went on to co-direct what would become the Oscar-nominated documentary \u201cRestrepo\u201d filmed over the course of the same platoon\u2019s deployment. Bobby, the soldier on the bottom of this image, is remembered by Junger as \u201cincredibly funny, extremely smart.\u201d On top is Cortez, \u201can incredibly sweet kid,\u201d said Junger, adding that he was \u201csort of the pretty boy in the platoon.\u201d The photograph is currently on display at London\u2019s Imperial War Museum (IWM), accompanied by an excerpt from Hetherington\u2019s journal written that same year: \u201cIn the end it has little to do with the war, and a lot to do with being men\u2026 Or in the case here, becoming men.\u201d The works form part of an exhibition called \u201cStoryteller: Photography by Tim Hetherington,\u201d which opened on the 13th anniversary of the photographer\u2019s death (he was killed by shrapnel while filming and photographing the Libyan Civil War in April 2011). Junger agrees with his friend\u2019s sentiment. \u201cOne of the things that place is very good at is turning children into men. And I think that\u2019s always been true of war.\u201d Young men in conflict \u201cThe experience of war was the only opportunity that men had in a society to express unconditional love for each other,\u201d is a quote that Hetherington often repeated, according to his friends. He first learned it from another friend, photographer James Brabazon while the pair waited with Liberian rebel forces who were going to attack the capital Monrovia, during the Liberian Civil War in 2003. It was Hetherington\u2019s first experience of combat. Brabazon first heard the saying from his grandfather, a British soldier who served in World War II. \u201cHe just clearly, really took it to heart,\u201d said Brabazon in a video interview with CNN. \u201cTim was really interested in the dynamics of young men\u2026 He was really interested in how young men related to one another, how they represented one another to each other, where those representations came from, how they were amplified and how they were perpetuated \u2014 particularly in conflict.\u201d In a remote outpost where society was \u201cstripped away,\u201d these bonds captured Hetherington\u2019s attention more than the war itself. \u201cI became much more interested in the inter-relationships between the soldiers and my own relationship to the soldiers than I was in the fighting,\u201d reads a quote from Hetherington in the exhibition.\u00a0\u201cMy examination of young men and violence, or of young men\u2026 It\u2019s as much a journey about my own identity as it is about those young soldiers,\u201d he wrote. Following his year in the Korengal, Hetherington published \u201cInfidel,\u201d a photography book of stills taken during his deployment with bits of commentary from himself and the US soldiers he was embedded with. One contributor is Cortez, one of the subjects of the photo, who wrote: \u201cI told them time and time again that if a grenade went off, I would actually throw myself on the grenade\u2026 Because I actually love my brothers. I mean, it is a brotherhood\u2026 I think any of them would do it for me also.\u201d \u2018It\u2019s very important that this work happened\u2019 The IWM, which holds the entire archive of Hetherington\u2019s work, worked with researchers and different communities to find out how they engaged with conflict photography. Greg Brockett, who curated the exhibition, was especially interested in how refugee communities would respond to Hetherington\u2019s work. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to say how people are going to respond\u2026 Because a lot of them have experienced war and conflict directly,\u201d he told CNN over a video interview.\u00a0\u201cWhat struck me was there was generally an overwhelming sense of people who felt it\u2019s very important that this work happened, and people were able to see the realities they experience.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m less interested in people taking away knowledge of Tim, I\u2019m more interested in people taking inspiration away from Tim,\u201d said Stephen Mayes, executive director of the Tim Hetherington Trust, who also spoke to CNN via video call. Hetherington was distinguished from other conflict photographers by his approach, which involved spending prolonged periods of time with his subjects. He often used film cameras and would speak to his subjects while photographing them. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t interested in photography in and of itself, for its own sake. He was interested in how that would allow him to access the lives of others,\u201d said Brabazon. \u2018It took a little bit from his soul\u2019 In this process, Hetherington worried about how photography could be extractive. \u201cHe wanted the process to be consensual and also to leave something in the community,\u201d added Brabazon, recounting a series of street photographs Hetherington took in Liberia where he would take photographs of people, keeping one Polaroid for himself and giving another to the subject. \u201cI think that was really important, because it allowed people to have agency in the work that was being created\u2026 It\u2019s about extending the courtesy of participation in the creation of the work to the subject themselves.\u201d Hetherington\u2019s friends reflect on the tragedy of his death in Libya, believing he was killed in his prime as a photographer \u2014 not only because of the images he produced, but because of his reflections on what it meant to capture conflict. Mayes mentions the old adage that making a picture takes a little piece of the subject\u2019s soul. \u201cTim thought, definitely, in his mind, he\u2019d sold his soul to the devil in a way, because he saw that in making every picture he made, it took a little bit from his soul.\u201d \u201cWhat did Tim want the effect of his work to be? That is a question which I don\u2019t think we will every really know the answer to, because he died in the process of working that out himself,\u201d Brabazon explained. In his final diary entry on April 19, 2011, Hetherington wrote about attending the funeral of a rebel fighter who was killed by a mortar. He wrote of the young men he met there: \u201cThey are grimily happy that we are here to help them. They feel that now the whole world can see.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/style/tim-hetherington-photography-snap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_04_27_style_rr-head-labs-denver-barbers-prison", "text": "\u201dThis is nerve-wracking,\u201d James Canody exclaimed \u2014 through an exhale \u2014 of his new job as an apprentice at the Denver-based business R&R Head Labs. When speaking with CNN, Canody had been working as an apprentice at the barbershop for 13 days. Fourteen days ago he had been released from prison, where he served 6 and a half years of an 18-year sentence. Canody is one of 650,000 people released from prison every year across the United States, according to the Department of Justice. That\u2019s a population of which nearly 75% are still unemployed a year after being released. According to the Brookings Institution, stable employment has been shown to reduce recidivism, but even for those who find a job, earning capacity is likely hindered: Based on a report released by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, formerly incarcerated people who do find employment after their release tend to earn just 53% of the median US worker\u2019s wage. Canody is one of eight employees \u2014 apprentices, barbers and managers \u2014 at R&R Head Labs, a barbershop which opened its doors in February exclusively employing formerly incarcerated and justice-impacted individuals. It aims to address the financial, logistical and emotional inequities associated with their reentry into society. Fresh starts and fresh cuts R&R Head Labs\u2019 model creates a pathway to employment by utilizing skills \u2014 and sometimes a barbering license \u2014 its employees gained while in prison. (Prison programs offering barber/cosmetology licenses are not federally mandated, rather determined state-by-state based on a variety of factors.) Barbering skills aren\u2019t a requirement to work at R&R Head Labs, however, as its paid apprentice program shepherds employees through training, the 2,000 hours of working as an apprentice and 300 hours of classroom or in-shop time required to get a barber license in Colorado. \u201cThis opportunity feels surreal and overwhelming,\u201d said Canody. \u201cBut that\u2019s a good thing. I am getting comfortable with being uncomfortable and see how barbering can help me change my life.\u201d R&R Head Labs is the brainchild of James Repenning,\u00a0a former president of the national barber chain Floyd\u2019s 99. After learning about prison barbering programs, he saw potential in combining his professional experience with a greater purpose. Together with an advisory council \u2014 a group which includes formerly incarcerated people turned advocates \u2014 Repenning has also implemented mentorship programs and community outreach in Denver. \u201cWe started by asking ourselves how we find barbers who have really committed to change and then asking, what do they need?\u201d Repenning explained in a Zoom interview with CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s about understanding how we support them in the work environment, because the pinnacle of what we want to do is give them hope and a path.\u201d Repenning and his team work with Colorado prisons to recruit individuals and get them into the apprenticeship program. According to Repenning, the support from the Colorado Department of Corrections has exceeded expectations, with parole officers facilitating barber tool starter sets and arranging job fairs. \u201cIt\u2019s important (for formerly incarcerated people) to make money \u2014 both because parole requires it and for basic survival,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe solution was to create apprenticeships, so someone can start working immediately and toward the hours they need to earn their barber license.\u201d Transformational opportunities In Denver specifically, R&R Head Labs recruitment and reentry efforts are steered by Charles Smith, a member of the company\u2019s advisory council. Smith served 24 years in prison; after his release, he became the director of advocacy and earned income strategies for CommunityWorks, a non-profit organization which provides job seekers with support service and job readiness instruction. Speaking about the main challenges formerly incarcerated individuals face, Smith lists housing and employment as the most crucial. \u201cEmployment is going to sustain you,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe idle mind is the devil\u2019s workshop. You start doing things, you start drifting. Employment keeps you stable and focused.\u201d \u201cThe model would be to have someone like Charles in every state we go to,\u201d added Repenning. \u201cMany of the people we talk to are people he served with, so there\u2019s a great deal of trust there.\u201d Smith aims to connect with inmates around 90 days before their release date, to start mentoring and prepping them to make their acclimation to life outside of prison easier and more tolerable. Understanding the \u201cpolitics of what happens in prison\u201d is something Smith considers a crucial aspect of his work, and one he believes offers an advantage in approaching and vetting prospective barbers. Several of the seven full-time and part-time barbers currently working at the first location are people Smith knew while serving his own sentence \u2014 including James Canody. \u201cPeople in prison are a forgotten population,\u201d said Smith. \u201cIt is a huge help to people coming out of prison to see and feel that someone finally believes in you. It makes you want to be better.\u201d In\u00a0keeping with its overarching ethos, even R&R\u2019s physical space was designed to best accommodate formerly incarcerated people. With guidance from the\u00a0advisory board, the space was specifically designed to minimize triggers for its employees,\u00a0down to its color palette and barber chair positioning. \u201cEverything by design has to do with connectedness,\u201d explained Repenning. \u201cA lot of barber shops are stainless steel\u2026 ours needs to be super welcoming and warm.\u201d Repenning and his team learned which colors and palettes to stay away from: Certain shades of orange, red, green and blue (which could serve as a reminder of jumpsuit colors) were out; brighter colors, embodying outdoor themes of woodlands and greenery were chosen instead to soften the environment and make it feel uplifting, energetic and approachable. Barber chairs are positioned so that no barber\u2019s back is to the door, another potential vulnerability for an employee who had previously served prison time. \u201cPrison can be a very dangerous place,\u201d said Repenning. \u201c\u2018Watching your back\u2019 takes on extra significance, thus our barbers tend to want to know who\u2019s behind them and who\u2019s walking into the space.\u201d A round bar where people are invited to sit and wait for their appointment was designed specifically to facilitate conversation and community. A barber\u2019s compensation includes floor earnings and commission comparable to other barbershops \u2014 but less commonly, barbers at R&R Head Labs are able to set (and raise) their own prices. Employees also receive health insurance and vacation pay. R&R Head Labs is looking to open an additional shop in Denver later this year, with future expansion into the Boston, Chicago, and New York markets planned.  In its first months of business, the R&R Head Labs location has attracted a diverse crowd, Repenning told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing every race, hair type, gender, income level and age. It\u2019s been a predictably slow start because our barbers typically don\u2019t come with a \u2018book\u2019 (of pre existing clients) as they would if they were transferring from another barbershop.\u00a0However, we are attracting 10+ new customers per day.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like bringing the \u2018hood and Beverly Hills together,\u201d added Smith. \u201cAnd creating this amazing beautiful space. A safe space.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/27/style/rr-head-labs-denver-barbers-prison/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}

No, this isn\u2019t an off-duty look from Sydney Sweeney or Emma Chamberlain \u2014 it\u2019s the latest outfit worn by British comedian and octogenarian John Cleese. On Friday, Cleese \u2014 who is best known as a founding member of UK comedy troupe Monty Python, as well as the star and co-creator of British sitcom \u201cFawlty Towers\u201d \u2014 stepped out in the unseasonable London sunshine with a $550 appliqu\u00e9 denim logo cap from Miu Miu shielding his eyes. Of course, we have questions. In a mad dash to make a radio show appearance, did Cleese blindly reach for the nearest baseball hat? Was it simply left in the vestibule by his model-turned-comedian daughter, Camilla Cleese? Or is the senior a dedicated Miu Miu man? It wouldn\u2019t be the first time a comedian had a penchant for fashion. In the 1990s, Robin Williams was spotted on the red carpet in pieces from Jean Paul-Gaultier, Issey Miyake and Alexander McQueen. Miuccia Prada\u2019s second label, founded in 1992, has beat it\u2019s bigger sister Prada to the top spot on Lyst\u2019s Hottest Brand Index twice \u2014 a metric that measures the public\u2019s interest in luxury fashion houses. According to the platform, searches for Miu Miu this year have increased 57%, while the brand also reported significant growth in the first quarter of 2024 \u2014 with sales up a record 89%. Miu Miu informed CNN that the comedian is not an official brand ambassador, confirming that the hat is instead a rare instance of organic marketing. But perhaps he should be on the affiliate roster, because Cleese is a surprisingly fitting embodiment of the Miu Miu mantra. Originally billed as the spry, sometimes juvenile sibling to grown-up Prada, Miu Miu has not so much rebranded as redefined its vision of youth. \u201cI say to myself every single morning, \u2018I have to decide if I am a 15-year-old girl or a lady near death,\u2019\u201d Miuccia Prada said after the Fall-Winter 2024 show. The Italian label has succeeded in striking a balance between its Gen Z ambassadors (Emma Chamberlain, Ayo Edebiri, Emma Corrin, to name a few) and those above 50. In September, 63-year-old British actor Kristen Scott Thomas walked the runway for Miu Miu at Paris Fashion Week, along with 70-year-old Dr Qiu Huilan \u2014 who was promoted from loyal customer to catwalk model overnight after being invited to participate by the brand on Instagram. Instead of nailing itself to a literal interpretation, Miu Miu has cultivated an emphasis on youthful energy \u2014 of which Cleese oozes (somewhat literally, too, thanks to the \u00a317,000 cosmetic stem cell therapy treatment he has been receiving annually for the last 20 years). Speaking to host Chris Evans on Virgin Radio on Friday, the comedian recalled a recent meet-up with the other founding fathers of Monty Python, Michael Palin and Terry Gilliam. \u201cI said it was 18 feet of Python,\u201d he told Evans. \u201cAnd it was good to see them again. We\u2019re very silly. We\u2019re disgraceful for old people.

These are just three of the models who have graced the cover of Sports Illustrated\u2019s famous \u2014 and at times controversial \u2014 \u201cSwimsuit Edition.\u201d Now, to celebrate the special issue\u2019s 60th year in print, the magazine has unveiled seven new covers featuring 27 women and reuniting past cover models for a \u201cLegends\u201d photo shoot. Kate Upton, Chrissy Teigen, plus-size model Hunter McGrady, and CBS News host Gayle King all posed for their own solo covers. (This marks the fourth time Upton has appeared on the magazine\u2019s cover, and the second time for Teigen.) The remaining three \u201cLegends\u201d covers feature alumni including Chanel Iman, Maye Musk, Megan Rapinoe and Winnie Harlow, among others, as well as snowboarder (and gold medal-winning Paralympian) Brenna Huckaby, the first amputee model to appear in the \u201cSwimsuit Edition\u201d and Halima Aden, the first hijabi model. In a news release, Sports Illustrated editor-in-chief MJ Day said that the \u201cSwimsuit Edition\u201d has \u201ctranscended its origins.\u201d What \u201cbegan as a mere diversion in the winter months when the sports calendar was relatively empty\u201d is now \u201ca global symbol of empowerment, diversity and positivity.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve done our best to honor women of all shapes, sizes, ages and backgrounds,\u201d said Day. \u201cWe\u2019ve strived to reshape societal norms and redefine the standards of beauty. This year\u2019s issue does just that.\u201d Sports Illustrated debuted its first-ever \u201cSwimsuit Edition\u201d started in 1963, with a young German model named Babette March on the cover, pictured frolicking on a beach in Mexico in a white bikini. Since then, the yearly special issue has become a mainstay. It has at times attracted criticism because of its focus on women\u2019s bodies. Over the past few years, the magazine has included a more diverse range of fashion models in its pages, including trans models Leyna Bloom and Valentina Sampaio (as well as the trans singer Kim Petras), older models like Musk, and plus-size models like Ashley Graham and McGrady. The magazine has also expanded its portfolio of cover stars to feature musicians, athletes and celebrities like Beyonc\u00e9, Kim Kardashian, Naomi Osaka and Megan Thee Stallion. \u201cWith each passing year, we have challenged ourselves to push boundaries and redefine what it means to be Sports Illustrated Swimsuit,\u201d said Day in the news release. \u201cWhile this year\u2019s issue is a tribute to the recent past, it\u2019s also a reminder of the work we must continue to do. We must remind women to challenge the status quo, to celebrate strength and confidence, and to inspire those around us to embrace their uniqueness and pursue their passions fearlessly.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/style/sports-illustrated-swimsuit-issue-anniversary-covers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_04_16_style_copenhagen-old-stock-exchange-fire-intl", "text": "A huge fire has engulfed Copenhagen\u2019s old stock exchange, one of the Danish capital\u2019s most famous landmarks, causing its spire to collapse as staff and citizens scrambled to rescue paintings and historic artefacts from the blaze. \u201cI cannot describe how upset I and my colleagues are,\u201d said a visibly moved Brian Mikkelsen, CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce, which owns and has offices in the 17th century building. \u201cIt is a huge disaster, because it is 400 years of cultural history that is in flames.\u201d Stunned commuters and onlookers watched as the raging fire could be seen swirling around the building\u2019s distinctive 56-meter spire - shaped as the tail of four entwined dragons - moments before it collapsed and fell into the street below. Some passersby even joined emergency services to run inside the burning building and help carry large Renaissance paintings and other objects away from the blaze. Among the paintings saved was Danish artist Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s 1895 work \u201cFrom the Copenhagen Stock Exchange,\u201d the Chamber of Commerce said. Denmark\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, called the fire \u201cour own Notre Dame moment,\u201d referring to the blaze that destroyed the roof and spire of the Paris cathedral, five years ago almost to the day. The fire began at around 8.30 a.m. local time (2.30 a.m. ET), a Copenhagen fire department chief told CNN, and by 11 a.m. nearly half of the building had been destroyed. The fire was still burning by late afternoon. The Chamber of Commerce said it is \u201cat a loss for words for how great a tragedy this is.\u201d It said it was \u201ca sad day for our country\u201d and that \u201cthe damage will unfortunately be very expensive.\u201d \u201cWe have tried to rescue a lot of historic paintings that were inside the building and the historic furniture,\u201d Jakob Vedsted Andersen, an executive director at the Greater Copenhagen fire and rescue service, told CNN. He said it was \u201cway too soon\u201d to speculate about the causes of the blaze. Copenhagen police have told people to avoid the area and there have been no reported injuries so far. People were in the building when the fire started but they were all evacuated, said a police spokesperson who added that military personnel were at the scene to support fire-fighting efforts. A \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d is on fire, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said, calling the building\u2019s cultural heritage \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d The B\u00f8rsen building has been at the heart of Danish business since the 17th century. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt said 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he added in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Emergency services were working to control the fire but it had spread to all floors through the elevator shaft. Frank Trier Mikkelsen, operations manager at the Greater Copenhagen fire department, said the fire is burning \u201cviolently\u201d inside the building, according to TV 2, a government-owned TV channel. Forty firefighters were inside the building, with valuables being rescued, TV 2 reported. Mikkelsen told the Danish broadcaster that the fire is of a type that emergency managers dread, explaining parts of the building\u2019s roof need to be removed to extinguish it. He added machines have been called in to remove some of the copper roof, as the water just bounces off it.
