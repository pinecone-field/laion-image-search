When speaking with CNN, Canody had been working as an apprentice at the barbershop for 13 days. Fourteen days ago he had been released from prison, where he served 6 and a half years of an 18-year sentence. Canody is one of 650,000 people released from prison every year across the United States, according to the Department of Justice. That\u2019s a population of which nearly 75% are still unemployed a year after being released. According to the Brookings Institution, stable employment has been shown to reduce recidivism, but even for those who find a job, earning capacity is likely hindered: Based on a report released by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, formerly incarcerated people who do find employment after their release tend to earn just 53% of the median US worker\u2019s wage. Canody is one of eight employees \u2014 apprentices, barbers and managers \u2014 at R&R Head Labs, a barbershop which opened its doors in February exclusively employing formerly incarcerated and justice-impacted individuals. It aims to address the financial, logistical and emotional inequities associated with their reentry into society. Fresh starts and fresh cuts R&R Head Labs\u2019 model creates a pathway to employment by utilizing skills \u2014 and sometimes a barbering license \u2014 its employees gained while in prison. (Prison programs offering barber/cosmetology licenses are not federally mandated, rather determined state-by-state based on a variety of factors.) Barbering skills aren\u2019t a requirement to work at R&R Head Labs, however, as its paid apprentice program shepherds employees through training, the 2,000 hours of working as an apprentice and 300 hours of classroom or in-shop time required to get a barber license in Colorado. \u201cThis opportunity feels surreal and overwhelming,\u201d said Canody. \u201cBut that\u2019s a good thing. I am getting comfortable with being uncomfortable and see how barbering can help me change my life.\u201d R&R Head Labs is the brainchild of James Repenning,\u00a0a former president of the national barber chain Floyd\u2019s 99. After learning about prison barbering programs, he saw potential in combining his professional experience with a greater purpose. Together with an advisory council \u2014 a group which includes formerly incarcerated people turned advocates \u2014 Repenning has also implemented mentorship programs and community outreach in Denver. \u201cWe started by asking ourselves how we find barbers who have really committed to change and then asking, what do they need?\u201d Repenning explained in a Zoom interview with CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s about understanding how we support them in the work environment, because the pinnacle of what we want to do is give them hope and a path.\u201d Repenning and his team work with Colorado prisons to recruit individuals and get them into the apprenticeship program. According to Repenning, the support from the Colorado Department of Corrections has exceeded expectations, with parole officers facilitating barber tool starter sets and arranging job fairs. \u201cIt\u2019s important (for formerly incarcerated people) to make money \u2014 both because parole requires it and for basic survival,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe solution was to create apprenticeships, so someone can start working immediately and toward the hours they need to earn their barber license.\u201d Transformational opportunities In Denver specifically, R&R Head Labs recruitment and reentry efforts are steered by Charles Smith, a member of the company\u2019s advisory council. Smith served 24 years in prison; after his release, he became the director of advocacy and earned income strategies for CommunityWorks, a non-profit organization which provides job seekers with support service and job readiness instruction. Speaking about the main challenges formerly incarcerated individuals face, Smith lists housing and employment as the most crucial. \u201cEmployment is going to sustain you,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe idle mind is the devil\u2019s workshop. You start doing things, you start drifting. Employment keeps you stable and focused.\u201d \u201cThe model would be to have someone like Charles in every state we go to,\u201d added Repenning. \u201cMany of the people we talk to are people he served with, so there\u2019s a great deal of trust there.\u201d Smith aims to connect with inmates around 90 days before their release date, to start mentoring and prepping them to make their acclimation to life outside of prison easier and more tolerable. Understanding the \u201cpolitics of what happens in prison\u201d is something Smith considers a crucial aspect of his work, and one he believes offers an advantage in approaching and vetting prospective barbers. Several of the seven full-time and part-time barbers currently working at the first location are people Smith knew while serving his own sentence \u2014 including James Canody. \u201cPeople in prison are a forgotten population,\u201d said Smith. \u201cIt is a huge help to people coming out of prison to see and feel that someone finally believes in you. It makes you want to be better.\u201d In\u00a0keeping with its overarching ethos, even R&R\u2019s physical space was designed to best accommodate formerly incarcerated people. With guidance from the\u00a0advisory board, the space was specifically designed to minimize triggers for its employees,\u00a0down to its color palette and barber chair positioning. \u201cEverything by design has to do with connectedness,\u201d explained Repenning. \u201cA lot of barber shops are stainless steel\u2026 ours needs to be super welcoming and warm.\u201d Repenning and his team learned which colors and palettes to stay away from: Certain shades of orange, red, green and blue (which could serve as a reminder of jumpsuit colors) were out; brighter colors, embodying outdoor themes of woodlands and greenery were chosen instead to soften the environment and make it feel uplifting, energetic and approachable. Barber chairs are positioned so that no barber\u2019s back is to the door, another potential vulnerability for an employee who had previously served prison time. \u201cPrison can be a very dangerous place,\u201d said Repenning. \u201c\u2018Watching your back\u2019 takes on extra significance, thus our barbers tend to want to know who\u2019s behind them and who\u2019s walking into the space.\u201d A round bar where people are invited to sit and wait for their appointment was designed specifically to facilitate conversation and community. A barber\u2019s compensation includes floor earnings and commission comparable to other barbershops \u2014 but less commonly, barbers at R&R Head Labs are able to set (and raise) their own prices. Employees also receive health insurance and vacation pay. R&R Head Labs is looking to open an additional shop in Denver later this year, with future expansion into the Boston, Chicago, and New York markets planned.  In its first months of business, the R&R Head Labs location has attracted a diverse crowd, Repenning told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing every race, hair type, gender, income level and age. It\u2019s been a predictably slow start because our barbers typically don\u2019t come with a \u2018book\u2019 (of pre existing clients) as they would if they were transferring from another barbershop.\u00a0However, we are attracting 10+ new customers per day.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like bringing the \u2018hood and Beverly Hills together,\u201d added Smith. \u201cAnd creating this amazing beautiful space. A safe space.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/27/style/rr-head-labs-denver-barbers-prison/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_style_la-chimera-alice-rohrwacher-isabella-rossellini-interview", "text": "In Alice Rohrwacher\u2019s latest movie, the gently hypnotic \u201cLa Chimera,\u201d a rakish Josh O\u2019Connor navigates the Italian countryside with a dowsing rod in hand, searching for ancient treasure. O\u2019Connor\u2019s character, Arthur, is one of the whispered about \u201ctombaroli\u201d \u2013 grave robbers \u2013 who in the 1980s scoured the hills of what was once Etruria, a civilization from the 7th to the 3rd Century BC. There\u2019s little glory to the pursuit; there\u2019s not even much money to be made grubbing along the bottom of a top-heavy black market in artifacts. But it seems it\u2019s all he\u2019s good for. In other aspects of his life Arthur cuts a shabby, aimless figure. However, with this rod comes purpose and direction, each step bringing him closer to his quarry. Is it an unseen power moving the stick, or blind chance? The outcome is the same, but for Rohrwacher the more mysterious answer is the one that enchants her. In an interview with CNN, when asked why she chose O\u2019Connor for the part, the Italian director said he was \u201cbrought to me by destiny.\u201d In fact, she also has a funny story involving the actor and Rohrwacher\u2019s parents (more of which later), but for a director whose work swirls with fable-like magic, the comment is on brand. Rohrwacher was born in Tuscany and still lives in the same region where the tombaroli have long plied their illicit trade. She studied ancient literature, Greek and Latin at college, and her fourth feature was a chance to marry filmmaking with \u201ca passion that I\u2019ve always had.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a deep connection between archaeology and cinema \u2014 or at least in my way of making cinema, and my desire to be an archaeologist to some extent,\u201d Rohrwacher said. \u201cI feel that sometimes mankind, as far as White men go, behave as if they were the only thing that exists, without a past and without a future,\u201d she explained. \u201cMy job is very close to what an archaeologist does: giving meaning to things that happened in the past.\u201d In the 1980s grave robbing and antique trafficking was rife. As with her previous films, \u201cHeavenly Body,\u201d \u201cThe Wonders\u201d and \u201cHappy As Lazzaro,\u201d Rohrwacher combined local non-actors and established talent to form her merry band of tombaroli, who have little respect for the past, desecrating tombs and passing along their finds to a mysterious broker. We meet O\u2019Connor\u2019s Arthur as he returns from a prison stretch for doing just this. Though he has the gift of finding tombs, Arthur is conflicted about the business. He\u2019s in debt so he has no choice but to continue, but he\u2019s also drawn to these places because of their spiritual aura. For this strange foreigner is mourning the death of a lover; an Orpheus in search of his Eurydice among the realm of the dead. Isabella Rossellini plays the late woman\u2019s mother Flora, who has a soft spot for Arthur, who might be the last link to her daughter. \u201cI asked Alice, \u2018Is this film about death?\u2019\u201d recalled Rossellini, in an interview from her home in New York State. \u201cShe said to me, \u2018It\u2019s not about death, it\u2019s about the beyond.\u2019 And there is a difference. The beyond is a presence that we might still feel.\u201d One senses Rossellini believes this deeply. The actress, model and daughter of director Roberto Rossellini and actress Ingrid Bergman was something of a casting coup for Rohrwacher \u2013 the biggest name yet to feature in one of her films. O\u2019Connor, the ascending star of \u201cThe Crown\u201d and \u201cChallengers,\u201d had to work a little harder to find his way to the project. The British actor had watched 2018\u2019s \u201cHappy as Lazzaro\u201d and decided to write her a letter. \u201cBut he couldn\u2019t find my address,\u201d she said. \u201cSo he sent a number of letters to all kinds of random addresses and one of them reached my parents\u2019 house.\u201d \u201cI had imagined this film with a much older protagonist,\u201d the writer-director shared, but the letter was \u201cbeautiful.\u201d The two met and she decided the 33-year-old \u201chad such an old soul. I realized that he could tell the story of this character, who\u2019s a little scruffy, but a romantic hero, and also somewhat ridiculous.\u201d Arthur\u2019s crumpled linen suit and puppylike demeanor is the acceptable face of and Virgil-like guide into a murky world where the sacred is despoiled, and discovery and loss go hand in hand. In one scene, the tombaroli open an ornate, untouched tomb. The frescoes, vivid for thousands of years, fade before our eyes; their majesty obliterated by a waft of outside air. Even before one of the robbers delivers a horrifying coup de grace to a statue, Rohrwacher condemns them for their intrusion. In real life, the tombaroli operated quite brazenly for much of the 20th Century, even giving interviews to press. The turn of the century saw new laws restricting the illegal movement of Italian antiquities internationally, and in recent years substantial hauls of Etruscan artifacts have been returned. Today Italy has a robust taskforce for protecting and retrieving stolen cultural heritage at home and abroad, including the \u201cBlue Helmets for Culture,\u201d a collaboration between the Carabinieri and UNESCO. But there\u2019s a lot of damage to undo. Countless objects have passed from robbers to middlemen to international private collectors without ever receiving academic scrutiny. \u201cThe Etruscans were a very mysterious civilization,\u201d said Rossellini. \u201cMaybe there was a matriarchy \u2026 We don\u2019t know, because we never deciphered their writing.\u201d With each act of vandalism, such mysteries become harder to solve. Rohrwacher urges the audience to learn more, including a reading list in her film\u2019s end credits (\u201cone movie, interesting though it might be, is limiting,\u201d she said). Nevertheless, there\u2019s a paradox to Rohrwacher\u2019s work. She despairs that the past was put up for sale, at the cost of us better understanding it. Yet an air of mystery is integral to the story she is telling. To approach \u201cLa Chimera\u201d with dense history and sharp facts threatens to tear at its ethereal qualities \u2014 a hallmark of Rohrwacher\u2019s filmmaking. Broadly speaking, her signature style contains a subtle marriage of past and present \u2013 one that didn\u2019t go unnoticed by Rossellini. \u201cI see my father\u2019s influence, or (Federico) Fellini or (Pier Paolo) Pasolini,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me it was a moving moment to work with a young auteur who knew so much about cinema and was so moved by my father\u2019s work.\u201d \u201cHer father was such a maestro for me,\u201d said Rohrwacher of the director behind \u201cPaisan\u201d (1946) and \u201cRome, Open City\u201d (1945), on whose neorealist shoulders she stands, while offering a dose of magic and playfulness the late Italian master did not. \u201cI am fully aware of the importance of that heritage,\u201d she added. \u201cMy memory, my gaze \u2014 my outlook \u2014 was shaped not just by my real experiences, but also by the outlook or gaze that other filmmakers have provided me about reality. It\u2019s as if they trained my eye muscles and they\u2019ve transformed my experience of the world.\u201d \u201cAlice talks about the presence in Italy of this past that never really dies. There is always the pressure of this history,\u201d said Rossellini. \u201cYou live your present and your future, but the past, it shapes you.\u201d However, the past is a slippery thing, as Arthur\u2019s journey so vividly portrays. We stand atop its many layers, but sometimes we find ourselves buried by it. Even if, like \u201cLa Chimera\u2019s\u201d tombaroli, we fail to see its true value, it\u2019s always there. \u201cThe past is not dead,\u201d argued Rossellini. Through Rohrwacher\u2019s eyes, it\u2019s not even past. \u201cLa Chimera\u201d is released in UK cinemas on May 10 and is available to stream in the US.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/style/la-chimera-alice-rohrwacher-isabella-rossellini-interview/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}

The British Library announced on X that its Treasures Gallery, where the Magna Carta is displayed, was temporarily closed on Friday morning. The library\u2019s press office posted to X that \u201can incident occurred at the British Library on Friday 10 May where two individuals attacked the toughened glass case containing the Magna Carta in the Library\u2019s Treasures Gallery.\u201d \u201cThe Library\u2019s Security team intervened to prevent further damage to the case, which was minimal,\u201d the press office continued, adding that police were notified and that the Magna Carta \u201cremains undamaged.\u201d London\u2019s Metropolitan Police told CNN that it has arrested \u201ctwo people on suspicion of criminal damage, both of which are currently in custody.\u201d The Magna Carta (Great Charter) is often regarded as the earliest declaration of human rights, credited with enshrining the rights of man in English law.

The first sign of Meghan\u2019s new business venture came in March, when she returned to Instagram after deactivating her personal account in 2018. Meghan rebranded the account American Riviera Orchard, and the bio confirms the account is run by her. So far details of the business have been sparse, with the nine Instagram posts simply forming a montage of the brand\u2019s logo. The American Riviera Orchard website is similarly mysterious, featuring just a landing page. However, a search of the public trademark database yielded information on a brand that matched that of Meghan\u2019s new company. That company, according to the records, offers retail items such as jams and preserves, butters, tablewares, cutlery, tablecloths, cookbooks and digital recipe offerings. The trademark records show the owner of the mark is an LLC that cites the same address where the office of Richard Genow, who is an attorney for the duchess, is located. In addition to the brand, Meghan continues to work with husband Prince Harry as part of Archewell Productions, which has two new nonfiction series in production at Netflix, the streaming giant confirmed to CNN earlier this month.

The timepiece sold for ten times its expected auction price of between \u00a3100,000 and \u00a3150,000. Its high selling point has set a \u201cnew world record for Titanic memorabilia,\u201d Andrew Aldridge, the managing director of auction house Henry Aldridge and Son, told CNN on Sunday. Astor was one of around 1,500 people who died when the Titanic sank on April 15, 1912 after hitting an iceberg. His pregnant wife, Madeleine, survived. The watch was among a number of notable items on offer at Henry Aldridge and Son in Wiltshire, England, on Saturday, including the valise that held the violin famously played by the band leader as the ship sank, and a pocketbook that documents the Titanic\u2019s scheduled voyages. The valise was sold for \u00a3360,000, while the violin itself was sold for \u00a31.1 million (nearly $1.7 million at the time) via the same auction house in 2013. It was, until Astor\u2019s pocket watch claimed the title, the highest-selling item from the Titanic. \u201cThese prices for these unique pieces of history reflect not only their importance but also the ongoing interest into the Titanic story and the memory of her passengers and crew,\u201d Aldridge told CNN. The watch was among the personal effects found with Astor\u2019s body after the Titanic sank, according to the auction house. He also had gold cufflinks, a diamond ring, money and a pocketbook on him, among other items. After the recovery of Astor\u2019s body, those possessions were sent to his son, Vincent Astor, who completely restored the watch so that it worked. In 1935, Vincent gave the watch as a christening gift to the infant son of William Dobbyn IV, John Jacob Astor\u2019s executive secretary, according to the auction house. Aldridge told CNN that the Dobbyn family kept the item until the late 1990s, when it went to auction. An unnamed collector in the United States bought the watch at that time.

{"id": "style_article_moshe-safdie-architect-singapore", "text": "There are few buildings that have more drastically shaped a city\u2019s image than Marina Bay Sands. Just as the Eiffel Tower and Burj Khalifa define the skylines of Paris and Dubai, the soaring three-tower resort, joined across the top by a horizontal \u201cskypark\u201d and the world\u2019s most famous infinity pool, is an icon both in and of Singapore. In fact, the hotel-casino project is so successful that the man who designed it doesn\u2019t even stay there. \u201cIt\u2019s too noisy,\u201d said Israeli-Canadian architect Moshe Safdie. \u201cI\u2019m a swimmer and I can never get in the pool because there are so many people taking pictures.\u201d Now resuming his once-frequent trips to Singapore amid easing travel restrictions, Safdie prefers the nearby Ritz-Carlton, where we meet for afternoon tea. (\u201cI had a British mother,\u201d he explained, \u201cso I\u2019m a sucker for scones and tea.\u201d) At a top-floor table overlooking his best-known creation, he reflected on the sometimes-fraught task of designing contemporary landmarks. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t on my mind as much as it was on their minds,\u201d he clarified, recounting the call for design proposals issued by the city-state\u2019s government in the mid-2000s. \u201cThey didn\u2019t quite say the building should become the icon of Singapore, but they talked about it being iconic.  \u201cWhen we made the submission, I said, \u2018Some buildings have the magic to become memorable and associated with a place.\u2019 And I mentioned Sydney Opera House as the classic contemporary example. But, I said, \u2018It\u2019s a mystery what makes that happen.\u2019\u201d The trick, it transpired, was designing something striking yet simple. Constructing a 0.2-mile-long cantilevered roof terrace atop three skyscrapers required a feat of complex engineering but, at its most abstract, Marina Bay Sands can be sketched in four basic strokes. In Singapore Sign Language, the landmark is referenced by simply raising three fingers of one hand and resting another digit across the top. Visible for miles around, it appears on postcards and newscast backdrops. The structure also stars in the official Singapore Lego set, which the architect proudly displays at his office back in Somerville, Massachusetts.  \u201cThat kind of stuff, you can\u2019t quite plan for or design \u2013 it just happens,\u201d he said of the building\u2019s success. \u201cBut I\u2019m very happy about it. It changed our lives in terms of the work we get.\u201d  Safdie\u2019s eponymous firm is in high demand. In the years since Marina Bay Sands opened in 2010, he has realized almost 20 major projects. Among them are the serene Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas and a dual-tower residential complex in Colombo, Sri Lanka, that sees one high-rise lean dramatically against the other. The architect also bequeathed Singapore with another landmark in 2019: Jewel, a nature-themed entertainment and retail complex that attracts throngs of Instagrammers to Changi Airport each day thanks to its verdant indoor waterfall.  Safdie has said he considers seeing finished projects in use to be among an architect\u2019s greatest pleasures. He makes a point of visiting Jewel whenever he\u2019s in Singapore. \u201cI was concerned about how the plants were doing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I was relieved to see they\u2019re thriving.\u201d The architect is not in Singapore to indulge in past glories, however. In the days after our interview, he will inspect two new developments: a gardenesque office complex in the island\u2019s west and a pair of residential towers on the upmarket Orchard Road. The latter features multiple skybridges \u2013 a recurring theme in Safdie\u2019s work that was recently taken to new extremes in Chongqing, China, where he lay a gargantuan \u201chorizontal skyscraper\u201d (containing an infinity pool, restaurants and an indoor garden) atop four 820-foot-tall towers.   Then there is the small matter of Marina Bay Sands\u2019 second phase. The expansion plans feature, among other things, a fourth tower \u2013 though Safdie dismissed early suggestions that his iconic skypark might be extended to rest across its top. In any case, Singapore officials have expressed that he shouldn\u2019t, in his words, \u201cscrew around\u201d with an icon. Instead, the new tower will stand apart from the other three, forming \u201csort of an exclamation mark,\u201d he explained, motioning punctuative strokes: \u201cBoooom\u2026 boom.\u201d  Radical vision  At 84, Safdie shows little sign of slowing down. Other recent trips have taken him to Sao Paolo, Brazil, where his glass-roofed Albert Einstein Education and Research Center recently opened its doors, and to the Ecuadorian capital Quito, where his tree-covered Qorner Tower will do so later this year. Covid-19 eased the architect\u2019s unrelenting travel schedule, but he used the downtime to pen a memoir, \u201cIf Walls Could Speak: My Life in Architecture.\u201d He said he felt it was \u201ctime to document things.\u201d  Published this week, \u201cIf Walls Could Speak\u201d serves as a reminder that much of Safdie\u2019s six-decade career has been dedicated to humbler pursuits \u2013 museums, memorials and social housing that reimagined how people might live in densely populated cities.  Before Marina Bay Sands, his best-known project was his very first: Habitat 67, a radical 1960s housing development that saw hundreds of identical prefabricated concrete units stacked into clusters along Montreal\u2019s Saint Lawrence River. Safdie\u2019s dream that it would spark a wave of large-scale \u201cHabitats\u201d around the world proved overly optimistic. His attempts to repeat the feat in other cities, including New York, Toronto and Iran\u2019s capital Tehran, have often been thwarted. Projects of such size require land, funding and political will, and Safdie\u2019s book openly recounts times when all three were lacking. But the principles underpinning the experiment \u2013 that apartment dwellers should enjoy access to outdoor space, views in multiple directions and the opportunity to interact with nature and neighbors \u2013 defined his work thereafter. Born in 1938 in Haifa, then part of British-controlled Palestine, Safdie has credited much of this architectural ethos to his childhood. As a boy, he always lived in apartment buildings, first in a Bauhaus-style block on Haifa\u2019s Mount Carmel and then at his family\u2019s new home further up the hill. At the latter, he would enter via a bridge, while the famous Baha\u2019i Gardens \u201calmost functioned as my backyard,\u201d he writes in \u201cIf Walls Could Speak.\u201d One need not look far for the inspiration behind the skybridges and elevated urban gardens that have since characterized his oeuvre. Safdie moved to Canada with his parents aged 15. (In a neat turn of events, he departed Israel via Lod Airport, since renamed Ben Gurion Airport, where decades later he would design a terminal building.) It was in Montreal that Safdie decided to pursue architecture \u2013 and where he first grew his signature mustache. He attended the city\u2019s McGill University and wrote a college thesis, \u201cA Case for City Living,\u201d outlining his vision for a flexible housing \u201csystem\u201d that could be adapted to different contexts and climates. Those early ideas have long shaped Safdie\u2019s outlook. They would shape his fortunes, too. After showing his college drawings to the influential modernist Louis Kahn, he secured an apprenticeship at the architect\u2019s Philadelphia office. Soon after, he was offered the chance to put his ideas into practice at a scale unimaginable to most young graduates.  Montreal was due to host the 1967 World Fair, or Expo 67. Despite having never completed a building, the then 24-year-old Safdie was asked by the event\u2019s mastermind (and his thesis adviser), architect Sandy van Ginkel, to develop a master plan for the site. He was also tasked with building on his ideas, eventually proposing a village-sized development of some 1,200 prefabricated dwellings stacked 20 to 30 stories high. His meticulous placement of each factory-built module was calculated to maximize garden space, allow in sunlight and improve residents\u2019 views. Interconnected pedestrian walkways and bridges lifted the urban realm above ground.  Political and financial realities scaled back his design; the final Habitat 67 comprised just 154 apartments \u2013 made from 354 modules and stacked 12 stories high across three \u201cclusters.\u201d It was, nonetheless, a major statement. In a postwar world rethinking how to accommodate rapidly urbanizing populations, Safdie\u2019s system of repeated modular forms offered a bold new model for housing. Three of the 20th century\u2019s most important architects, I.M. Pei, Paul Rudolph and Philip Johnson, toured the project together prior to its opening. Only when Johnson told Safdie that he had \u201coutdone\u201d the classical Italian architect Giovanni Battista Piranesi did he realize the project \u201cwas a game changer,\u201d he recounted. Habitat 67 was not universally adored. A New Yorker cartoon, which Safdie also displays at his Boston office, poked \u201cgentle fun\u201d at the project by depicting a spade-wielding child stacking sand into similar formations. Various journalists and fellow architects were more barbed in their criticisms.  \u201cIt\u2019s strange that something so radical done by a young person gets so much crap thrown at it,\u201d Safdie mused. \u201cBut that\u2019s been true of my career.\u201d   \u2018For everyone a garden\u2019  To define Safdie\u2019s career by either his breakout success or the \u201cmegascale\u201d projects of recent years would be to ignore much else in between.  In the early 1970s, he opened an office in Jerusalem, a city whose urban fabric he has profoundly transformed. As well as designing major institutions like the Hebrew Union College and the Yad Vashem Holocaust History Museum, he oversaw a full-scale rebuild of the destroyed Jewish Quarter and planned an entirely new city, Modi\u2019in-Maccabim-Re\u2019ut, about 15 miles to its northwest. At one point, he even considered running for mayor of Jerusalem. He has also built widely in North America, where his output spans from the meditative (a nondenominational chapel at the Harvard Business School) to the mammoth (Terminal 1 of Toronto\u2019s Pearson Airport). A citizen of Israel, the US and Canada, Safdie may be best known in the latter for the National Gallery in Ottawa, a grand glass palace housing some of the country\u2019s most treasured art.  Despite earlier setbacks Safdie has, more recently, found fertile ground for his \u201cHabitats\u201d in Asia. In 2017, he completed the first phase of the sprawling Habitat Qinhuangdao \u2013 in the titular city, about 200 miles from Beijing \u2013 a series of 16-story \u201cmini blocks\u201d connected by garden bridges. Back in Singapore, Safdie\u2019s pixelated Sky Habitat tower saw him stretch his familiar stacked forms high above the ground to maximize floor space on a comparatively small plot. In both cases \u2013 and throughout Safdie\u2019s career \u2013 ideals articulated in the 1960s have been adapted to meet the realities of new sites and clients. Yet, the architect maintains that his approach to housing remains, fundamentally, the same. \u201cThe belief in apartments being rethought as houses, in having gardens for every apartment, in quality of life, in streets and communities and making buildings that belong to their culture \u2013 from the outset these were fundamental to my beliefs,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they haven\u2019t changed. If anything, they have reinforced themselves as years go by.\u201d \u201cI think, without bragging, there\u2019s been consistency,\u201d he added. \u201cIn fact, you could say I\u2019ve not been dynamic enough, but I\u2019ve been pretty consistent.\u201d  Idealism and compromise   There were other high-profile proposals that never came to fruition. Among the most divisive was the Columbus Center, a pair of heavy-set towers once set to loom over Manhattan\u2019s Central Park at Columbus Circle before plans were scrapped following 1987\u2019s Wall Street crash (and amid vociferous criticism from the likes of Henry Kissinger and Jacqueline Onassis).  But Safdie\u2019s legacy will not be measured only by what was, or wasn\u2019t, built. Many of the once-radical ideas he championed are now mainstream \u2013 something he can take an amount of credit for. For one, his fixation on plant life, a principle he dubbed \u201cfor everyone a garden\u201d in a 1974 book of the same name, is now widely shared by younger architects. Urban gardens and \u201cliving walls\u201d are now almost de rigueur for new large-scale developments.  Plants do not always thrive, though. In his memoir, Safdie distinguishes between \u201csignificant plant life\u201d and \u201csorry shrubs.\u201d So-called biophilic architecture may now be all the rage, but it can be undone by insufficient planning or maintenance, leaving occupants with dying trees and even bug infestations. As such, Safdie welcomes the trend while cautioning again token gestures. \u201cThe idea of green buildings is a battle cry \u2013 everyone is for it,\u201d he said. Making them work, however, is another matter altogether. \u201cThere\u2019s a cynicism about so many architects presenting buildings that are fairly conventional and then, in the renderings, everything is green and every balcony is oozing with trees. When you look (closer), you see there\u2019s no preparation for the earth, there\u2019s no depth \u2013 it\u2019s a fantasy.\u201d Prefabrication, championed by the architect since his college thesis, is also enjoying a renaissance. Just two miles away from Marina Bay Sands, for instance, a Singaporean design firm is overseeing two 630-foot-tall residential skyscrapers built from units constructed in a factory over the border in Malaysia.  \u201cFor a long time, people totally gave up on (prefabrication),\u201d Safdie said. \u201cBut now there is a real shortage of labor and skilled labor \u2013 not in China, because they\u2019ve got an extraordinary workforce, and not in India, but everywhere else in Southeast Asia, in Singapore, in the West. So, anything that is labor-saving is now up for grabs.\u201d Much else has changed since Safdie formed his architectural ideals. For one, he \u201cnever would have imagined\u201d how densely populated cities would become in the past 50 years. \u201cPrograms change, lifestyles change, priorities change and technologies change,\u201d the architect added.  But what about him? Has his outlook changed, too? \u201cMy daughter accused me of not being as idealistic as I was,\u201d the architect said. \u201cI disagree with her.\u201d Safdie is nonetheless aware that the lofty principles of his youth may not be shared by the casinos or corporate clients he often works for. Being an architect sometimes means serving \u201cregimes you\u2019re not in love with and business entities whose values are different to yours,\u201d he noted.  \u201cTake the dilemma I had with Marina Bay Sands,\u201d he said, motioning once more toward the window and our view of the complex from the Ritz-Carlton\u2019s lounge. \u201cOn the one hand, the idea of doing a building that could promote \u2018gaming\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s a nice word for it, but \u2018gambling\u2019 is the reality \u2013 is almost immoral if you go there and see poor people with limited means wasting their money.  \u201cBut, to me, that was 2% or 3% of the area of a project that\u2026 could show what the public realm could be in a city. And that took over from the issue that nagged me.  \u201cThat\u2019s compromise,\u201d he concluded. \u201cBut the basic value, the idealism of the end product, has not diminished. Without it, I don\u2019t know how you can be an architect.\u201d \u201cIf Walls Could Speak: My Life in Architecture,\u201d published by Grove Atlantic, is available now.", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/article/moshe-safdie-architect-singapore/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "style_yushi-li-the-smothering-dream-snap", "text": " A group of men lie at the foot of a sofa, their naked bodies peeking out through a carpet of rose petals. Some look toward the photograph\u2019s protagonist, an Asian woman in a lime green dress laying across the cushioned loveseat. Others gaze away, seemingly indifferent, as if caught in some sort of hazy spell. Despite Chinese photographer Yushi Li\u2019s gentle staging, her title for the photograph, \u201cThe Smothering Dream,\u201d suggests something more sinister is at play. Referencing Dutch painter Lawrence Alma-Tadema\u2019s 1888 work \u201cThe Roses of Heliogabalus,\u201d in which a Roman emperor watches on as unsuspecting banquet guests slowly suffocate in flowers, Li\u2019s modern take \u2014 shot on a set awash with pastel colors and delicate furniture \u2014 is equally deceptive at first glance. Li, is not only the photographer, but also the muse at the center of the image. \u201cI made this very pink and kitsch dream,\u201d she said, describing the London living room set in a phone interview. \u201cBut underneath it, there is, like, some kind of violence. It\u2019s a fantasy of love and eroticism\u2026 smothering these men I desire.\u201d Shot in 2022, \u201cThe Smothering Dream\u201d was recently on show at Photofairs Shanghai as part of a group exhibition called \u201cA Quiet Gaze.\u201d It was a fitting title to showcase the work of an artist for whom an examination of the male and female gazes has been a recurring theme. Li\u2019s wider portfolio of subversive images include softly-lit nude portraits of strangers she scouted through a dating app (a series titled \u201cMy Tinder Boys\u201d). Stripped of their clothes and therefore their character, she said, the men lounge around their homes doing banal tasks: one scoops out of a fresh watermelon, while another casually balances a plate of spaghetti over his private parts. The series is partly a response to erotic images objectifying women that are historically ubiquitous in art, advertisements and photography. Although a canon of male nudes does exist, it largely comprises images shot by gay male photographers. When Li began the series in 2017, she noticed a lack of images depicting naked men as objects of desire from a woman\u2019s perspective. After some mistook her work as being shot by a male photographer, she began inserting herself into the photos \u2014 fully clothed alongside naked counterparts, and often the only person looking directly at the camera. \u201cInstead of being a passive, \u2018looked-at\u2019 thing, I want to be the one who is in control, who is creating the story, who is expressing my fantasy,\u201d said Li. Her images have also pushed back against the longstanding fetishization of Asian women, often by Western men, something Li said she has experienced first-hand: \u201cI\u2019m a small person, and come across as quiet, so I kind of fit the stereotype.\u201d Li, who was born in China\u2019s Hunan province and now lives in the UK. She said she feels flattered when women reach out to her online to say they feel empowered by her photographs. \u201cAs a woman, especially as an Asian or Chinese woman, you (should be able to) feel that you can also express your erotic desire.\u201d Who\u2019s in power? Li has been fascinated with how the idea of the gaze has, today, become \u201cless binary.\u201d She has also been examining and playing with the way classical paintings depict power dynamics, portrayals of desire and representations of the body. She brings these ideas into \u201cPaintings, Dreams and Love,\u201d an ongoing project to which \u201cThe Smothering Dream\u201d belongs. (A second photo from the same shoot, entitled \u201cAfter the Dream,\u201d hints at what has just taken place, with satin cushions and wilted petals strewn about the scene). Other sources of inspiration include Swiss painter Henry Fuseli\u2019s 1781 \u201cThe Nightmare,\u201d showing an incubus crouching menacingly atop a sleeping woman, and \u201cThe Death of Actaeon,\u201d Renaissance painter Titian\u2019s 16th-century oil painting of the Romans\u2019 goddess of the hunt, Diana, transforming the Theban hero into a stag that is then killed by his own hounds. In Li\u2019s reinterpretations, she is in full control. In the former, she wears a tight, red turtleneck as she casually sits on an unsuspecting male figure, thwarting the idea of seduction. In the latter, she strikes a calm, calculated pose, pointing a bow and arrow at a naked man in a window. But control, Li says, is subjective in images where multiple gazes can co-exist. \u201cSome of these men (in the photographs) also look at me, and the viewer also looks at all of us,\u201d she said. The internet age, she added, has only further complicated matters. \u201cNow you can look at so many things like instantly, everywhere, or wherever, whenever you want\u2026 it\u2019s something very different, it\u2019s not (just) a physical thing, it\u2019s a digital thing. \u201cThere\u2019s also the gaze from the algorithm, and the gaze from the screen that reflects yourself when you look at it\u2026 the internet (means) we\u2019re subjected to the gaze more, in a way.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/yushi-li-the-smothering-dream-snap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}

His young subjects are seen smoking cigarettes, lifting weights and trimming one another\u2019s hair. Other images show them hanging out in a grubby yard or lying around on mattresses. The photos were shot with the help of nine young Moroccans whom Beltr\u00e1n befriended in Seville, capital of the southern region of Andaluc\u00eda. Published in his new book \u201cDialect,\u201d the pictures were initially intended to be personal, not political. But they ultimately spoke to what Beltr\u00e1n called a \u201cKafka-esque\u201d system in which the men waited for years to learn whether their residency applications would be approved. \u201cAt the beginning, it was just about this group of guys,\u201d Beltr\u00e1n said on a video call from Madrid. \u201cBut of course, I realized that I was photographing these really specific political bodies, or political subjects in this bureaucracy.\u201d Last year, nearly 30,000 migrants arrived in Spain by sea, down from a record of over 58,000 in 2018, according to UNHCR data. Of these, most arrived in the Canary Islands or Andaluc\u00eda, a region separated from Morocco by the Strait of Gibraltar, a stretch of water just 13 kilometers (eight miles) at its narrowest. The nine men, who didn\u2019t previously know one another, were among those to arrive by boat during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic in search of a better life. Recounting his journey with an essay in \u201cDialect,\u201d one of Beltr\u00e1n\u2019s subjects, Youssef Elhafidi, recalls another terrified teen migrant being forced by smugglers to pilot their boat. \u201cHe did not want to drive, the fear was paralyzing him, they took out a knife and put it on his neck, threatening him to start the engines,\u201d Elhafidi wrote. \u201cThe boy started the machine between trembling and crying and we headed north.\u201d Killing time According to Beltr\u00e1n, his nine subjects were required to stay in Spain for three continuous years before applying for residency. Undocumented and without the right to work during this time, they were dependent on the state for food and housing. While living at the government-run facility, the men took Spanish lessons and joined workshops to help them adapt to life in Spain \u2014 some of which were run by Beltr\u00e1n. Overcoming an initial language barrier, the photographer began working with the group to produce images and videos. As well as candid portraits, the pictures focus on conditions at the facility, from peeling walls to basic food supplies. Many of the images were, however, staged. As Beltr\u00e1n looked for different ways to engage with his subjects, he asked them to re-enact moments from their respective migration journeys. In one, a subject lies motionless on blue gym mats, just as he had upon landing on Spain\u2019s coast. Another shows two of the men carrying a third on their shoulders to recreate the moment he fainted during a day-long walk to Seville from a small town to its south. The resulting book is thus part documentary and part performance, with Beltr\u00e1n toeing the line between mentor and collaborator, photographer and choreographer. More than just an artistic decision, staging photos directly responded to the tedium of the migrants\u2019 abundant free time. \u201cThere was an activity around taking the images \u2014 it was something during the day that (could get them) excited. And it was fun,\u201d Beltr\u00e1n recalled. \u201cEveryone was laughing, and they just make jokes each other during the sessions.\u201d Lost in translation When Beltr\u00e1n began delivering workshops at the facility in 2020, he was all too familiar with the system his subjects were trapped in. A few years earlier, he had relocated to Spain from his native Colombia, and \u2014 even as a college-educated Spanish speaker \u2014 also struggled to navigate the complex immigration processes. To illustrate the challenge facing his francophone subjects, his project included a video titled \u201cRecital\u201d in which they attempted to read the first four pages of the Spanish immigration law that would determine their futures. \u201cThey weren\u2019t understanding a word,\u201d he recalled, noting that, although lawyers were assigned to act on the men\u2019s behalf, the language barrier and dense legalese removed their agency. The opening pages of \u201cDialect\u201d \u2014 whose title alludes to these very linguistical challenges \u2014 are dedicated to stills from the video. Pictures of the men struggling to comprehend the legislation are overlaid with technical terminology (\u201cRight to effective judicial protection\u201d reads the text on one frame; another says, \u201cAuthorizations for the purpose of carrying out profit-making activities\u201d). \u201cThese legal procedures are really, really complicated, even for native speakers,\u201d said Beltr\u00e1n, who is now completing a PhD program in photography in Madrid. \u201cIt becomes almost like translation work \u2014 translating these laws and bureaucracies into (something understandable to) normal people like us.\u201d The result, he said, is an inevitable sense of helplessness. \u201cYou can\u2019t talk with anyone,\u201d Beltr\u00e1n added. \u201cYou can\u2019t ask, \u2018Who is the law?\u2019 or \u2018Who is the state?\u2019 You don\u2019t have anyone to approach. You don\u2019t have any tools to make a living\u2026 The system is built to avoid you, or to deny you access to (it).\u201d Describing the group as \u201cjust young people trying to figure out what to do with life,\u201d the photographer hopes his project can humanize migrants\u2019 experiences in a world increasingly desensitized to images of their suffering. Since Beltr\u00e1n completed his project, most of his subjects have completed their three-year wait and now formally reside in Spain, he says. He remains in touch with some \u2014 including Elhafidi, who he says works in a restaurant and has accompanied him at promotional events for the book\u2019s launch. In the conclusion of his essay, Elhafidi recalled how he felt when he secured his residency, writing: \u201cIt took me three years of searching and putting courage to life, until finally the moment came, after being cold, scared, hungry and the most difficult thing, my mother\u2019s tears\u2026 I got it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI got the papers. Now after getting it I have another look at life, I finally feel that I have the opportunity to be whoever I want to be.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re building their lives,\u201d Beltr\u00e1n said of those, including Elhafidi, who have secured residency. \u201cFortunately, they now can go back to Morocco to visit and see their families.\u201d \u201cDialect,\u201d published by Loose Joints, is available now.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/07/03/style/felipe-romero-beltran-dialect-spain-migration/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}

The complex was decorated with painted plaster, mosaics and there was a collection of tiny, tightly-coiled lead scrolls suggesting some sort of ritual or pilgrimage might have taken place there, according to a press release. The villa in Grove would have been \u201ccentral for this area of Oxfordshire,\u201d Francesca Giarelli, project officer for Red River Archaeology Group and the site\u2019s director, told CNN on Thursday. She described a building that likely had multiple levels. The structure, which stretched across 1,000 square meters (10,800 square feet) on just the ground floor, was probably visible for miles, Giarelli added. Hundreds of coins, plus rings, brooches, mosaic tesserae and painted plaster with floral motifs have been uncovered during the year-long excavation, allowing archaeologists to pinpoint a long period of Roman activity at the site from the 1st or 2nd century into the late 4th or early 5th century. Archaeologists also discovered an aisled building, a bigger and more impressive hall-like structure built after the villa once the family that owned it became richer over time, Giarelli said. In Roman times, villas were not simply residential dwellings but more like \u201csmall administrative centers,\u201d Giarelli explained, often with responsibilities for maintaining roads, planning the crops surrounding it and acting as a \u201csafe space\u201d to store food products during unstable times. Even in the late Roman period, this particular villa continued to show signs of human activity. A horse-headed buckle, dated to 350-450 AD, suggests the presence of late Roman elites or someone who still wished to be associated with that period, though such buckles can also be associated with early Anglo-Saxon burials, archaeologists said in a statement to CNN. Excavating the site, described as \u201cremarkable\u201d in a press statement, began before the housing developers Barratt and David Wilson Homes started their building work and after two evaluation trenches had been dug. The trenches revealed a \u201chigh potential for archaeological presence,\u201d Giarelli said, prompting an archaeological investigation, which began two months before the building work and is still ongoing. The site still holds some mysteries to unravel in the continuing excavations.  Archaeologists haven\u2019t yet found \u201cwhere all the people ended up,\u201d Giarelli said, though they believe there is a burial somewhere on the site, and there have been some artifacts, such as the lead scrolls, that point toward a sanctuary present, but still hidden underground.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/28/style/roman-villa-development-oxfordshire-intl-scli-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_style_upcycled-clothes-fashion-brands-lawsuits", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 A little over a year ago, NFL player Travis Kelce stepped out in a flamboyant silk shirt emblazoned with two barrel-chest-sized pink flamingos and trimmed across the bottom with a giant Chanel logo. The design was upcycled from vintage Chanel scarves by stylist Logan Horne, whose brand, J. Logan Home, specializes in refashioning heritage luxury accessories. His pieces, which retail at close to $3,000 each, have also been worn by the musicians Dua Lipa and 2 Chainz and are sold at stores including Farfetch, Kith and The Webster. They\u2019ve also caught the attention of the French luxury giant\u2019s legal department. In February, lawyers acting for Chanel sent Horne a cease and desist letter, demanding his label stop selling products bearing its logo and other brand signifiers. It\u2019s the latest in a flurry of cases that have turned upcycling into an emerging legal battle ground, pitting a practice that\u2019s been pitched as key to improving the industry\u2019s sustainability credentials against the established bounds of trademark protection. \u201cWe really have these two values that point in different directions,\u201d said Fashion Law Institute founder Susan Scafidi. \u201c(Upcycling) is absolutely risky, despite the fact that it is trending and ethical.\u201d Why is upcycling controversial? Chanel\u2019s objection to J. Logan Home\u2019s designs isn\u2019t exactly a bolt from the blue. Major luxury players have historically been wary of the secondary market, concerned it could damage their carefully controlled hold on brand distribution and image, cannibalize sales and encourage counterfeiting. It\u2019s a tension that has played out prominently over the last decade thanks to the rapid rise of online resale platforms. Though some brands have begun to tentatively embrace the space, others have remained cautious. Chanel, in particular, has pursued high-profile cases against re-commerce players it argues are using its brand without permission and selling fakes. (The brand scored a major win earlier this year, when a New York court awarded it $4 million in damages in its suit against the resale business What Goes Around Comes Around. A separate legal dispute with The RealReal is ongoing.) Smaller-scale upcycling has attracted less attention so far. But the practice has become more widespread, driven in part by demand for logo-heavy streetwear, greater access to vintage products and deadstock fabrics and a growing desire among young designers to operate sustainably. That\u2019s given rise to an increasing number of trademark and copyright infringement complaints targeting upcyclers from brands including Louis Vuitton and Levi\u2019s, as well as Chanel. In 2022, Louis Vuitton secured a $603,000 pay out and permanent injunction in a Texas case against a business selling refashioned Vuitton products. Last year, Levi\u2019s brought a complaint against French label Coperni, alleging it was using pocket stitching and fabric tabs confusingly similar to the famed denim label. The sale of such products, alongside items that had actually been upcycled from Levi\u2019s jeans without authorization, created additional risk of consumer confusion, the company argued. Both brands declined to comment when reached by Business of Fashion. Does upcycling infringe on brands\u2019 trademarks? The disputes reflect legitimate trademark and copyright concerns, but they also raise questions over how far these protections should stretch when they conflict with broader sustainability goals, according to legal experts. \u201cIt is a grey area within the law,\u201d said Scafidi. \u201cBrands absolutely have a legal leg to stand on. The question is how well-clad it is.\u201d In general terms, once a brand has sold an item, it becomes fair game to be resold or redistributed by third parties. But this principle, known as the first-sale doctrine or trademark exhaustion, may not apply if an item has been reworked or embellished, lawyers said. Upcyclers can take precautions, like avoiding the prominent use of logos, or providing consumers with clear disclosures that reworked products are not authorized or affiliated with the brands they reference (an approach J. Logan Home adopted). But these steps still may not be sufficient to counter arguments of copyright or trademark infringement, according to lawyers. And while the legal frameworks protecting companies\u2019 intellectual property are well established, whether the sustainability benefits of upcycling should be weighed against these hasn\u2019t really been tested. \u201cIf we want to move from a linear to a circular economy, we need to upcycle,\u201d said Irene Calboli, a professor of law at Texas A&M University. \u201cThe fact that intellectual property law gets in the way of those who want to upcycle or recycle is just wrong.\u201d Chanel said it is paying close attention to sustainability matters, pointing to its work with L\u2019Atelier des Mati\u00e8res, which recycles unsold items and deadstock from luxury and premium brands. \u201c(Upcycling is) a positive trend that we continue to explore, and we have always been conscious of the need to strike a balance between protecting the rights of our brand and the rights of others to create and trade freely,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cHowever, the use of elements stamped with the Chanel logo is sometimes simply an unauthorized misappropriation of our trademarks\u2026 in such cases, we take the action we deem appropriate to protect our rights.\u201d The wider legal crackdown hasn\u2019t only targeted brands making prominent use of logos either. Before she became a celebrated New York designer, Batsheva Hay worked as a copyright lawyer. So it was a shock when she found herself on the receiving end of a cease and desist letter from a large commercial brand over a short run of dresses made from deadstock fabric sourced from India. Though it bore no obvious logo, as it turned out, the print she used had been made for a bigger player who didn\u2019t want to see it reproduced elsewhere. \u201cI was really humiliated and horrified because I thought it was some cool vintage fruit print and it turned out to be some kind of junky commercial print,\u201d said Hay. Rather than take on the time and expense of fighting the case, she just took the remaining three dresses she hadn\u2019t yet sold off her site. What does this mean for the future of upcycling? Horne says he can\u2019t afford to fight Chanel, which has threatened to seek statutory damages of $2 million per mark, disgorgement of all profits and payment of its attorney\u2019s fees if he doesn\u2019t stop selling products carrying the company\u2019s branding, according to a copy of the letter reviewed by Business of Fashion. Instead, he said he\u2019s looking at to pivot his brand while continuing to find creative ways to address the industry\u2019s issues with waste and over-production. The dream would be an opportunity to officially collaborate with an established label on an upcycled collection. \u201cAs much as I believe in my mission\u2026 I\u2019m not trying to go bankrupt going to battle with Chanel,\u201d he said. Industry watchers say the current flurry of cases reflect a broader adjustment to emerging new models. Some big brands, like Prada, Gucci and indeed Levi\u2019s, have already dabbled with upcycling collections and programs of their own. Anna Foster, who runs the refashioned brand E.L.V. Denim, has partnered with companies including Gabriela Hearst and The Outnet to help upcycle excess inventory. These days, she says she\u2019s having about a conversation a week with brands interested in exploring collaboration, but the industry moves slowly. Meanwhile, politics may be moving at a faster speed, creating different challenges for brands. Both consumers and policy makers are increasingly aware of the huge levels of waste generated by the fashion industry, with new regulations that would make brands more responsible for dealing with old clothes and excess inventory in the pipeline in both Europe and the US. \u201cWe really are at an inflection point where we might have a result in court that is different from the result in the court of social media,\u201d said Scafidi. \u201cIt\u2019s that tension that really needs to be resolved.\u201d This article was originally published by\u00a0The Business of Fashion, an editorial partner of CNN Style.

{"id": "2024_05_09_style_umasofia-srivastava-miss-teen-usa-resignation-intl-hnk", "text": "Miss Teen USA resigned Wednesday, sending further shock waves through the pageant community just days after Miss USA said she would relinquish her crown. In an Instagram post Wednesday, Miss Teen USA UmaSofia Srivastava said her \u201cpersonal values no longer fully align with the direction of the organization.\u201d \u201cAfter months of grappling with this decision, I have made the choice to resign from the title of Miss Teen USA 2023,\u201d wrote Srivastava in a statement on her personal account. The high school teen from New Jersey won the pageant back in September and had expressed her pride at being the first Mexican-Indian American to hold the role. \u201cI look forward to the rest of the year as I finish 11th grade as part of the National Honor Society and start the college application process, knowing that my academic career has been defined by my hard work, and my hard work alone,\u201d she added. She said she would continue her advocacy for education and acceptance alongside work with the Lotus Petal and Bridge of Books foundations. The pageant responded with an Instagram post, writing that it respected Srivastava\u2019s decision, considered the well-being of titleholders \u201ca top priority,\u201d and that a successor would be named soon. Srivastava and the Miss Universe and Miss USA organizations did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Her resignation comes on the heels of another queen relinquishing her title earlier this week.  On Monday, Noelia Voigt stepped down from her Miss USA title, citing her mental health. When she took the crown in November, Voigt, who is Venezuelan American and from Utah, said she would work to connect with diverse communities across the United States. \u201cDeep down I know that this is just the beginning of a new chapter for me, and my hope is that I continue to inspire others to remain steadfast, prioritize your mental health, advocate for yourself and others by using your voice, and never be afraid of what the future holds, even if it feels uncertain,\u201d she posted on Instagram. \u201cNever compromise your physical and mental well-being. Our health is our wealth,\u201d she wrote. Her post drew speculation from fans that Voigt was sending a hidden message about a non-disclosure agreement, with the first letter of the first 11 sentences of her statement spelling out \u201cI am silenced.\u201d A spokesperson for the Miss USA Organization told CNN in a statement on Monday that they supported Voigt\u2019s decision to step down from her duties and that \u201cthe well-being of our titleholders is a top priority, and we understand her need to prioritize herself at this time.\u201d The organization added they are reviewing plans for the \u201ctransition of responsibilities to a successor\u201d and that they will announce the new Miss USA soon. The resignations, along with the organization\u2019s social media director Claudia Michelle also stepping down last week, have raised questions among fans around the culture of beauty pageants and whether aspects are in need of an overhaul. Michelle has been more candid about alleged problems at the organization. In an Instagram post she wrote she disavows \u201cworkplace toxicity and bullying of any kind.\u201d Miss Universe and Miss USA did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Some of Voigt\u2019s fellow Miss USA contestants shared a post claiming that \u201cthe majority\u201d of the 2023 class supported her decision to leave and asked the Miss USA Organization to release Voigt from her NDA clause \u201cso that she is free to speak on her experiences.\u201d  ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/style/umasofia-srivastava-miss-teen-usa-resignation-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "style_greg-girard-kowloon-walled-city-snap", "text": "It was the summer of 1989. Hong Kong\u2019s humidity \u2013 already oppressive \u2013 was intensified\u00a0in the dark, maze-like alleyways of an unruly enclave known as Kowloon Walled City. Then the most densely populated place on Earth, its buildings were packed together so tightly that barely a slither of sky was visible from the ground. Searching for a moment of respite from the heat and chaos below, photographer Greg Girard found himself on the roof of one of the enclave\u2019s many illegally-built high-rises among a tangled thicket of television antennas. He wasn\u2019t alone. In the Walled City, the delineation of private and public spaces \u201cwasn\u2019t always so clear,\u201d Girard recalled in a video call, adding that the roof was an escape for many of its residents to relax, do laundry or watch planes land at Kai Tak International Airport. \u201cOnce you get up to the rooftop, everything sort of changes. The vista opens up, and it\u2019s cooler, there\u2019s a breeze.\u201d Navigating the narrow gaps between buildings with planks of wood, children would skip and play between the webs of laundry lines and satellites.\u00a0\u201cNo one seemed to think of it as a dangerous place, even though there were no guardrails or anything like that,\u201d said Girard. On that particular summer day, some children spotted Girard\u2019s camera and approached him. When he turned the lens on them, they began performing and pulling faces. He snapped several shots, describing the final one, which he eventually chose to publish, as the moment when they had \u201csettled into this face-off with me.\u201d In the photograph a young girl, barefoot and wearing a blue dress, stares into the camera. Her face is relaxed and her hands are wrapped around an antenna pole as if she\u2019s about to swing. In the backdrop, her friend strikes a defiant stance, hands on her hips, while another is in the throes of messing around, bent double in a playful squat. \u201cI thought (the image) captured the kids\u2019\u00a0indifference to the potential danger \u2026 of the rooftop, while at the same time sort of owning their territory and confronting me while goofing around,\u201d said Girard, adding: \u201cIt was just quite an average day up on (there).\u201d The playfulness of the children, juxtaposed with the jagged antennas and stark concrete of their surroundings, seem to epitomized the spirit of Kowloon Walled City, the photographer said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an ideal playground but that never seemed to bother anyone \u2014 which was, of course, very much the spirit of the Walled City: making the best of, and even enjoying life in, a situation most other people would be horrified by.\u201d A \u2018strange, vertical village\u2019 Girard first visited Kowloon Walled City in 1986 while on a shoot at the nearby airport. At that time, around 350 buildings, up to 14 stories high, were packed precariously into a space of 0.01 square miles. Most of the towers were built without proper foundations or regard for safety codes. \u201cThis strange, vertical village wasn\u2019t really supposed to exist,\u201d said Girard, explaining the Kowloon Walled City was the product of a historical and political quirk. Although the enclave was situated in the middle of Hong Kong, then a British colony, imperial officials refused to take legal responsibility for it. As such, the Walled City remained technically subject to Chinese rule, though this was never enforced. \u201cThat allowed it to become something you couldn\u2019t have dreamed up,\u201d Girard added. Existing in ambiguity for nearly a century, it had a reputation for illicit dealings and was infamous for its triads, drug dens, brothels and unlicensed dentistry. But by the time the Canadian photographer made his first visit to the \u201cthriving\u201d city in 1986, triad control had waned and these characterizations were, he said, \u201cvery out of date.\u201d \u201cIt might have been true at one time,\u201d he added. But his enduring memory of the place was the community that lived there. \u201cYou quickly realize that it\u2019s just a place where folks are trying to get by, like any other working-class part of Hong Kong.\u201d Girard was determined to demystify the so-called \u201cCity of Darkness,\u201d particularly after the colonial government announced plans in 1987 to demolish it. He spent four years documenting the Walled City with fellow photographer Ian Lambot, with the pair eventually publishing a book of their images in 1999. Early on, Girard decided to photograph the series in color and used portable lighting equipment \u2014 similar to the kind he used to capture celebrities and CEOs for glossy magazine portraits. \u201cThe only pictures you saw of the Walled City at the time tended to be in black and white, and they made the place look as bad as possible, in keeping with the reputation of the Walled City as a dangerous, squalid slum,\u201d said Girard. When it came to capturing people\u2019s day-to-day lives, and images of residents, shopkeepers and factory owners, the photographer wanted to use \u201ca more even-handed approach,\u201d he added. Girard documented, among much else, the blurred chaos of noodle and fish ball factories, a young child inspecting his grazed knee on the counter of his family\u2019s grocery store, and a barber curling a client\u2019s hair. While initial reactions to his presence were often frosty (\u201cthere was a palpable unwelcomeness to outsiders,\u201d he recalled), residents eventually allowed him into their cramped apartments. His guiding principle, Girard said, was \u201cto try to show it for what it really was, since rumor and myths were the only things that were known about the place.\u201d Imagined dystopias When the Walled City was razed, from 1993 to 1994, that was supposed to be the end of it. But in the decades since, the enclave has arguably garnered more interest than it ever did while standing. In 2014, Girard and Lambot published a \u201crevisited\u201d edition of their book that explored the city\u2019s legacy in popular culture \u2014 including as an inspiration for fictional dystopias in video games and films, such as \u201cCall of Duty: Black Ops\u201d and \u201cBatman Begins.\u201d \u201cThe Walled City was this jumping-off point for an imaginary city where the normal rules don\u2019t apply,\u201d said Girard. There has been renewed interest in architectural circles, too: The unregulated, organic construction that made Kowloon Walled City a \u201cdystopia\u201d to live in is now being examined as a source of innovation due to its resourceful use of limited space and cheap or second-hand materials, said Girard. \u201cThe limitations of that place certainly spurred a lot of creative responses, in building terms, to (the question of) what to do in a place that no one cares about, or pays attention to, except the residents,\u201d Girard added. The site of the Walled City has since been transformed into a public park, which opened in 1995. Quiet and uncrowded, it is in many ways the opposite of what it replaced, providing a much-needed reprieve from the clamor of a city desperately short on public space. Open-air chess pavilions and banyan-shaded ponds surround the old yamen building, a relic of the 19th-century Chinese garrison city that once stood on the site and the only structure to survive the demolition. Inside the building, Girard\u2019s famous rooftop photo is blown-up to fill an entire wall, accompanied by an audio track of children laughing and the roar of airplane engines. The memory of a vibrant community \u2014 immortalized by photographers like Girard \u2014 lingers. Ongoing interest in the Walled City is, Girard suggests, because of the spirit it encapsulates: the aptitude for survival even in the harshest of circumstances. \u201cIt still continues to fascinate,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s wonderful.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/greg-girard-kowloon-walled-city-snap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_04_16_style_copenhagen-old-stock-exchange-fire-intl", "text": "A huge fire has engulfed Copenhagen\u2019s old stock exchange, one of the Danish capital\u2019s most famous landmarks, causing its spire to collapse as staff and citizens scrambled to rescue paintings and historic artefacts from the blaze. \u201cI cannot describe how upset I and my colleagues are,\u201d said a visibly moved Brian Mikkelsen, CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce, which owns and has offices in the 17th century building. \u201cIt is a huge disaster, because it is 400 years of cultural history that is in flames.\u201d Stunned commuters and onlookers watched as the raging fire could be seen swirling around the building\u2019s distinctive 56-meter spire - shaped as the tail of four entwined dragons - moments before it collapsed and fell into the street below. Some passersby even joined emergency services to run inside the burning building and help carry large Renaissance paintings and other objects away from the blaze. Among the paintings saved was Danish artist Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s 1895 work \u201cFrom the Copenhagen Stock Exchange,\u201d the Chamber of Commerce said. Denmark\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, called the fire \u201cour own Notre Dame moment,\u201d referring to the blaze that destroyed the roof and spire of the Paris cathedral, five years ago almost to the day. The fire began at around 8.30 a.m. local time (2.30 a.m. ET), a Copenhagen fire department chief told CNN, and by 11 a.m. nearly half of the building had been destroyed. The fire was still burning by late afternoon. The Chamber of Commerce said it is \u201cat a loss for words for how great a tragedy this is.\u201d It said it was \u201ca sad day for our country\u201d and that \u201cthe damage will unfortunately be very expensive.\u201d \u201cWe have tried to rescue a lot of historic paintings that were inside the building and the historic furniture,\u201d Jakob Vedsted Andersen, an executive director at the Greater Copenhagen fire and rescue service, told CNN. He said it was \u201cway too soon\u201d to speculate about the causes of the blaze. Copenhagen police have told people to avoid the area and there have been no reported injuries so far. People were in the building when the fire started but they were all evacuated, said a police spokesperson who added that military personnel were at the scene to support fire-fighting efforts. A \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d is on fire, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said, calling the building\u2019s cultural heritage \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d The B\u00f8rsen building has been at the heart of Danish business since the 17th century. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt said 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he added in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Emergency services were working to control the fire but it had spread to all floors through the elevator shaft. Frank Trier Mikkelsen, operations manager at the Greater Copenhagen fire department, said the fire is burning \u201cviolently\u201d inside the building, according to TV 2, a government-owned TV channel. Forty firefighters were inside the building, with valuables being rescued, TV 2 reported. Mikkelsen told the Danish broadcaster that the fire is of a type that emergency managers dread, explaining parts of the building\u2019s roof need to be removed to extinguish it. He added machines have been called in to remove some of the copper roof, as the water just bounces off it.

{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible.

Stella died at his home in Manhattan. His wife, Dr. Harriet E. McGurk, said the cause was lymphoma, according to The New York Times. \u201cIt has been a great honor to work with Frank for this past decade,\u201d said Marianne Boesky, who has represented Stella since 2014, in a statement. \u201cHis is a remarkable legacy, and he will be missed.\u201d Born in 1936, Massachusetts native Stella attended Phillips Academy Andover, where he studied painting under Patrick Morgan. He then studied history and painting at Princeton under Stephen Greene and Willliam Seitz, before moving to New York City in the late 1950s. Stella achieved early fame with his monochromatic \u201cBlack Paintings,\u201d which were displayed at the Museum of Modern Art when he was just 22, and became his most famous contribution to the postwar abstract movement. Stella used house paint and a wide brush to create black stripes and left evenly spaced thin lines of exposed canvas\u00a0between them. He was prolific for six decades, evolving his medium with elements of mixed media and non-conventional geometric canvases\u00a0to blur the boundary between painting and sculpture. His acclaimed works include the \u201cProtractor Series\u201d of curved lines and bright colors, created in the late 1960s and early 70s, as well as the neon-speckled \u201cMoby Dick\u201d-inspired sculptures from the 80s and 90s. Stella continued to create art well into his ninth decade, with his some of his recent sculptures being displayed at the Jeffrey Deitch Gallery in New York City.

{"id": "2024_03_18_style_japan-shigeichi-negishi-karaoke-inventor-death-intl-hnk", "text": "Shigeichi Negishi, the entrepreneur who invented the world\u2019s first karaoke machine, has died aged 100. Negishi, whose 1967 \u201cSparko Box\u201d prototype is among several devices credited with ushering in Japan\u2019s karaoke craze, died from natural causes in January. His death, which was made public last week, was confirmed to CNN by Shiro Kataoka, managing director of the All-Japan Karaoke Industrialist Association. Born in 1923, Negishi founded and ran a company\u00a0that assembled car stereos for automobile manufacturers in northern Tokyo. A regular listener to a singalong radio show\u00a0broadcast in Japan at the time, he hooked a\u00a0spare tape deck up to a microphone and mixing circuit so he could hear himself singing over music. \u201cWhen I asked the factory engineer, he said, \u2018It\u2019s easy,\u2019\u201d Negishi recalled in an account published by the All-Japan Karaoke Industrialist Association, an industry body for Japan\u2019s karaoke operators.\u00a0\u201cSo, I attached a microphone input terminal to the car stereo and created something like the prototype of a jukebox.\u201d According to author Matt Alt, whose interview with Negishi features in his 2020 book \u201cPure Invention: How Japan Made the Modern World,\u201d the inventor first tested the device with an instrumental tape of Yoshio Kodama\u2019s 1930s song \u201cMujo no Yume.\u201d \u201cIt works!\u201d he told Alt, recalling the moment he heard his voice\u00a0coming through the speakers alongside the music. \u201cThat\u2019s all I was thinking. Most of all, it was fun. I knew right away I\u2019d discovered something new.\u201d Marketing the device as a Sparko Box, he sold them alongside lyrics cards and reportedly produced and installed around 8,000 around Japan, mainly at bars and restaurants. By the time Negishi stopped selling the products in the 1970s, several rival machines had been invented and taken to market. \u201cAt that time, it was not customary to sing in stores, so it may have been inevitable that (the Sparko Boxes were) sold as background music,\u201d reads Negishi\u2019s entry on the\u00a0All-Japan Karaoke Industrialist Association\u2019s website.\u00a0\u201cNow that I think about it, it\u2019s a bit of a shame.\u201d The industry body does not credit a single person with inventing karaoke (which literally translates as \u201cempty orchestra\u201d), but instead recognizes several people who independently created machines in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Perhaps the best known of them is musician and businessman Daisuke Inoue, whose\u00a08 Juke machine \u2014 invented in 1971, and also based on a car stereo \u2014 is credited with helping commercialize karaoke. But Inoue, like Negishi, did not patent his invention, and electronics manufacturers soon began producing and marketing their own versions. By the 1980s, \u201ckaraoke boxes\u201d (known elsewhere as KTVs) had swept Japan, with private rooms overtaking bars and restaurants as the main venues for Japan\u2019s amateur singers. Subsequent developments, including the introduction of video karaoke and networked karaoke systems, helped the phenomenon spread across Asia and the world in the following decades. Today, Japan is home to more than 8,000 dedicated karaoke box venues, while 131,500 bars are equipped with karaoke machines \u2014 a market worth\u00a0a combined 387.9 billion yen ($2.6 billion) in 2022,\u00a0according to estimates from the All-Japan Karaoke Industrialist Association.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/18/style/japan-shigeichi-negishi-karaoke-inventor-death-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}

Roberts, an actor who has become a mainstay of rom coms and campy horror \u2014 the latter, most recently with recurring roles in the anthology series \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d \u2014 bought the home, which she shares with her three-year-old son Rhodes, in 2022 and hired the design firm Pierce & Ward to overhaul its interiors. In the May issue of Architectural Digest, she reveals the results of that makeover. For Roberts, having a space that feels like home is a particular priority, she explained, as she moved often as a child. So when she saw the property listed as a rental on Instagram (it has been reported as a former residence of Minnie Driver), she inquired if she could purchase it instead. \u201cI think I lived in 10 houses by the time I was 15 \u2014 so for me now, having a son, I wanted a place that felt really ours.\u201d she told AD. \u201cI have a picture of the day we moved in\u2026 I just remember feeling like we are exactly where we need to be.\u201d The designers, Louisa Pierce and Emily Ward, with whom Roberts had previously worked, are known for down-to-earth spaces that mix bohemian, mid-century modern and rustic styles. Their clients have included Roberts\u2019 \u201cMadame Web\u201d co-star Dakota Johnson as well as Kate Hudson and Leonardo DiCaprio. \u201cWe want a house to look like it\u2019s been there for 50 years,\u201d Pierce told AD in the cover story. \u201cWe never want a home to look new.\u201d In that spirit, much of Roberts\u2019 furniture, art and decor is repurposed or reupholstered. In the living room, beneath a disco ball-like globe light, paperbacks are enclosed in living room cabinets while rarer books are openly displayed. Framed photographs of Debbie Harry and Joni Mitchell rest on wooden cabinets; elsewhere, one of Roberts\u2019 most treasured artworks \u2014 a Julian Wasser portrait of Joan Didion in front of a Corvette \u2014 hangs on the wall. Though many pieces are courtesy of design studios or antique finds, Pierce and Ward don\u2019t look down on more accessible commercial brands. Roberts recalled when she asked if her new kitchen island was custom-made, they laughed and said it was from Urban Outfitters. As for a room for Rhodes, who is starting his own book collection, Roberts opted for a soothing wallpaper scene of flying ducks on the ceiling, above a lush forest-themed upholstered bed. \u201cI remember as a kid, whatever\u2019s on your wall and your ceiling is seared into your brain for the rest of your life,\u201d Roberts explained. \u201cSo I wanted to make it extra cozy and fun, but not too overwhelming.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/16/style/emma-roberts-la-home-architectural-digest/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}

Cattelan\u2019s piece \u201cSunday (2024)\u201d consists of 64 stainless-steel panels plated in 24-carat gold and dotted with thousands of bullet holes. The work was created by a group of licensed professionals at a gun range in Brooklyn, who shot more than 20,000 rounds into the 3mm-thick panels, which were made in Europe. \u201cWe live in a world where the rich are getting richer and the poor are becoming poorer,\u201d Cattelan told The Art Newspaper. \u201cHistory has taught us how violently that polarization can end. \u201cThis idea was present in \u2018America\u2019 (the solid-gold toilet installed at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 2016), and I have used gold once again to talk about another aspect of the United States. America was about wealth, and this new work is about violence and wealth,\u201d he added. While Gagosian declined to comment on cost, The Art Newspaper understands that the panels are individually priced between $300,000 and $400,000. Cattelan is not represented by Gagosian but instead chooses to work with galleries on individual projects.

{"id": "style_mmakgabo-helen-sebidi-lost-artworks-the-walking-house-south-africa-sweden-spc", "text": "It was a phone call that changed everything. \u201cWe have some good news.\u201d Mmakgabo Helen Sebidi had been waiting to hear those words for more than 30 years. It was May 2023, and the celebrated South African artist, by then 80 years old, could barely believe it. \u201cYour works in Sweden have been found.\u201d Sebidi let out a scream. \u201cMy babies, my babies,\u201d she said into the phone. She was referring to her artworks. Mysteriously lost in 1991, they were coming home at last. Origins of an artist Sebidi was born in 1943 near Hammanskraal, South Africa, north of Pretoria. Her mother had moved to Johannesburg to work as a domestic worker, leaving her daughter in the care of Sebidi\u2019s grandmother, whose traditional painting style would become a major influence on her future. \u201cShe taught me how to do it,\u201d Sebidi recently told CNN, adding she would sometimes surprise her grandmother with a piece she\u2019d done on her own. Sebidi left school after grade eight to take a job as a domestic worker while also learning dressmaking. Any money she made, she sent home to support her grandmother. It was not until 1970, in her late twenties, that Sebidi would take her first official art classes, learning painting and sculpting. Her instructor was John Koenakeefe Mohl, one of South Africa\u2019s pioneering Black professional artists and teachers. Under the umbrella of the Johannesburg Art Foundation, an organization aimed at supporting\u00a0 practicing artists who were not able to go to university, Sebidi would display her works under a tree, once a month, together with other artists in what was called \u201cArt in the park.\u201d \u201cPeople would go and look at mainly terrible stuff but very, very occasionally \u2013 almost never \u2013 an extraordinary artist would emerge,\u201d said Mark Read, chairman of the Everard Read Group of Galleries, which now represents Sebidi. \u201cHelen is the grand luminary figure who emerged from the Johannesburg Art Foundation.\u201d Her talent was evident from the beginning, Read recalled. \u201cThere was never any guiding needed with Helen Sebidi,\u201d he added. \u201cThe opposite was always the case. She now and then thought that we needed guiding, which is probably entirely correct.\u201d Against the backdrop of apartheid policies in South Africa throughout the 1970s, Sebidi continued to refine her craft and find her voice, often depicting traditional imagery from a time before colonialism would grip the continent. An invitation in 1985 to showcase her work at the Federated Union of Black Artists (FUBA) sparked widespread attention for her work. It was her first solo exhibition and a first for a Black female artist. It was a moment that would change the trajectory of her career. Four years later, Sebidi received a Fulbright Scholarship to travel to the US and continue her art at the prestigious Millary Colony for the Arts in New York state. \u201cMy child became my work\u201d Yet it was an opportunity in Sweden in 1991 that would result in a most unexpected turn of events. As part of a program designed to introduce the world to rising South African artists \u2013 who would in turn have an opportunity to meet and establish contacts with Swedish artists \u2013 Sebidi accepted an invitation to the Swedish city of Nyk\u00f6ping to exhibit a series of paintings. Her trip would involve a one month residency where she would share South African knowledge with students at Nyk\u00f6ping Folk High School \u2013 just as South Africa was on the brink of democracy. \u201cIt was a very vibrant time for the visual arts in South Africa,\u201d said Kim Berman, a professor of visual arts at the University of Johannesburg. \u201cPeople were really excited about imaging what a new democracy looked like; corporates and organizations wanted to buy young artists\u2019 work, put it on their wall, and take down the kind of impressionist European posters.\u201d Two years before her Nyk\u00f6ping trip, Sebidi was involved in a serious car accident where she almost lost her life. During the incident, she says she received instruction in the form of a vision with a woman\u2019s voice to paint the body of work that would become the collection she\u2019d exhibit in Sweden. \u201cI was dead in that car accident,\u201d Sebidi recalled. \u201cThe women, the voices came from deep green, very deep green and the road I wanted to go to my mother, was black, black, black, and the other side was this strong, beautiful forest.\u201d Sebedi worked tirelessly to produce work that would tell the story of her lived experience, and that of Black South Africans. Compelled by her grandmother\u2019s voice and that of her ancestors, she called the collection \u201cNtlo E Etsamayang (The Walking House).\u201d  Although Sebidi never had children of her own, her art filled her life. \u201cMy child became my work,\u201d she said. A devastating mystery unfolds The paintings were all made over the course of about a year, where she couldn\u2019t sleep. Sebidi was haunted by visions and continued to work, her ancestors speaking to her saying, \u201cyour work is not done, get back to your work,\u201d said Gabriel Baard, the curator of Sebidi\u2019s most recent exhibition in Johannesburg. \u201cBefore this kind of period between 1990 and 1991, (Sebidi) was working quite monochromatically. She worked in etchings and liner cuts, occasionally silk screens,\u201d he added. Contrary to her usual technique, these new paintings exposed \u201ca reflection on her emotional state at the time. They are frantic, and fast and you can see the hand movement throughout every single drawing; an expression and an outlet to deal with her trauma,\u201d Baard described. With her artworks unframed and wrapped in rolls, Sebidi traveled to Sweden in 1991. As another artist was currently exhibiting, the curator at the school behind the project\u00a0assured her to leave them in his care, and he\u2019d call when it was her turn. That call never came. After a year went by without any communication, Sebidi requested her work be returned. But she was told that it had gone missing \u2013 believed to have been stolen. Over the years, she exchanged numerous letters with the organizers, but it was all in vain. She says the pain of losing her \u201cchildren\u201d pushed her to \u201cwork harder and harder.\u201d She became a figurehead representing Black women as a mentor in South African arts. \u201cThere were textbooks written about her \u2013 she was included in the curricula for many of the schools,\u201d Berman said. Her other works were exhibited all over the world, including the Smithsonian in the US. In 2004, she was awarded the Order of Ikhamanga by former South African President Thabo Mbeki \u2013 among the country\u2019s highest honors, given to those considered \u201ca national treasure.\u201d But all the attention and accolades in the world still could not bring her missing paintings back home. The homecoming In May 2023, while cleaning out a cupboard in the attic of Nyk\u00f6ping Folk High School in Sweden, caretaker Jesper Osterberg discovered a large paper roll with Sebidi\u2019s name, and a marker that indicated it had traveled from Johannesburg to Stockholm, on Swiss Air Freight. It was the majority of Sebidi\u2019s missing \u201cNtlo E Etsamayang (The Walking House)\u201d collection, 32 years after it was lost. Baard traveled to the south of Sweden to collect the 28 found pieces and deliver them back to Sebidi. His first encounter with them was very emotional, he said, seeing this body of work that had been missing for over three decades. \u201cI saw the faces actually at the top of the triptych kind of peering out to me,\u201d Baard described. \u201cIt was transcendental and spiritual as I watched the work come to life.\u201d With great excitement and anticipation, Sebidi rallied her whole community, family and friends to welcome the pieces back home. As she unrolled her work for the first time in 32 years, onlookers gasped in amazement. \u201cThe work was truly timeless,\u201d said Read. \u201cLooking at it, one couldn\u2019t say with any degree of surety what era it was from; inevitably that will mean that in the future it\u2019ll also be just as fresh.\u201d A new generation On April 6, \u201cNtlo E Etsamayang (The Walking House)\u201d went on display to the public for the first time at the University of Johannesburg Art Gallery, in partnership with Everard Read Gallery and the Swedish Embassy in Pretoria. The paintings illustrate tumultuous groups of figures sometimes tumbling upon each other like a continuous dance. The colors feature shades of orange and deep reds, with thick paint on handmade paper that was sometimes torn and stuck on top of each other, adding texture and character. Though there are still four small oil paintings missing, Sebidi is content with having her \u201cchildren\u201d back home and accessible for a new generation. She says she believes that her work \u201cwas hidden by those ancestors wanting the current generation to prepare ourself for the bigger voice, bigger energy.\u201d Reflective of the \u201cNtlo E Etsamayang (The Walking House)\u201d shaped by her grandmother, Sebidi hopes her work will influence the university to teach its students about indigenous knowledge. \u201cAfrican knowledge systems need to be created and have to be launched and have to be in free places,\u201d Sebidi said. \u201cWe need those freedoms.\u201d Mmakgabo Helen Sebidi\u2019s exhibition is on display at the University of Johannesburg Art Gallery until May 17, 2024.", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/mmakgabo-helen-sebidi-lost-artworks-the-walking-house-south-africa-sweden-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_11_style_miss-usa-pageant-organization-allegations", "text": "During their year of service, pageant queens are highly visible, making appearances at major events, advocating for important causes and speaking at public engagements, all in an official capacity. But following the shocking double resignation of Miss USA 2023 Noelia Voigt and Miss Teen USA 2023 UmaSofia Srivastava this week, just days apart, insiders are painting a picture of national titleholders kept absent from their usual duties, their organization in disarray, and key players who appear to be unable to voice their experiences \u2014 and concerns. The Miss USA organization, which runs both pageants, has come under fire amid accusations of mismanagement, a hostile work environment, and conditions that led, in particular, to Voigt\u2019s resignation on the grounds that her role was impacting her mental health. While Srivastava, 16, who represented New Jersey at Miss Teen USA, released a statement on Instagram saying that her personal values \u201cno longer fully align\u201d with those of the organization, Voigt, 24, who represented Utah at Miss USA, wrote a long but cryptic post, citing her mental health. Soon, however, it went viral for an apparent hidden message \u2014 the first letter of the first 11 sentences spelled out \u201cI am silenced.\u201d (Voigt has not subsequently addressed this speculation.) \u201cWe respect and support Noelia\u2019s decision to step down from her duties,\u201d the Miss USA pageant said in a statement following Voigt\u2019s announcement. \u201cThe well-being of our titleholders is a top priority, and we understand her need to prioritize herself at this time.\u201d The organization has not returned CNN\u2019s request for further comment. In response, a number of current state titleholders who competed alongside Voigt for Miss USA \u2014 including Miss North Carolina USA 2023 Jordyn Ashlee McKey, Miss Wisconsin USA 2023 Alexis Loomans and Miss New York USA, Rachelle di Stasio \u2014 shared social media messages in support of Voigt, asking the organization to \u201crelease Noelia from the confidentiality NDA clause of her contract, in perpetuity, so that she is free to speak on her experiences and time as Miss USA.\u201d Denise White, a PR representative for both Srivastava and Voigt \u2014 and the 1994 Miss Oregon USA \u2014 alleged that both winners are restricted by \u201cironclad\u201d non-disclosure agreements in their contracts. To date, neither Voigt or Srivastava has publicly revealed more about what led them to quit. But in a resignation letter provided to the Miss USA organization and obtained by CNN, Voigt outlined a number of concerns, ranging from frustrating managerial issues to more serious allegations. In it, she described a \u201ctoxic work environment\u201d that \u201cat best, is poor management and, at worst, is bullying and harassment.\u201d She accused the pageant\u2019s CEO, Laylah Rose, of \u201cslandering\u201d her character in conversations with people inside and outside of the organization, including calling Voigt \u201cmentally ill.\u201d Rose is an entrepreneur and CEO of the VIP Pageantry Network, who took over the brand in 2023. Voigt says Rose\u2019s communications to her were \u201ccold and unnecessarily aggressive,\u201d and that she never received a formal meeting about her responsibilities. Despite the lack of communication about her role, she was \u201cconstantly\u2026 threatened with disciplinary action, including taking away my salary,\u201d according to the document. The organization failed to arrange travel accommodations for Voigt on multiple occasions, she wrote, and did not provide her with an apartment and car for months, as had been outlined in her prize package. Nor did she have an \u201ceffective handler,\u201d she claimed, the latter leading to an instance where Voigt says she was sexually harassed during a Christmas parade event in Sarasota, Florida, while alone with an unnamed person in a car. According to Voigt\u2019s letter, Rose is \u201cactively building a culture of fear and control, the antithesis of women\u2019s empowerment, that is\u2026unsafe for future titleholders and employees.\u201d Nor, she wrote, can she publicly voice her concerns, saying she is \u201csilenced contractually from being able to speak up for myself.\u201d \u2018Things are falling apart\u2019 Voigt and Srivastava\u2019s respective resignations were not coordinated, according to White. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve witnessed and seen is harassment, a toxic work environment and bullying,\u201d White said in a telephone interview with CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s just not conducive to a women\u2019s organization that uplifts women and is supposed to promote using your voice. It\u2019s quite the opposite.\u201d Both pageant winners sought out support from management at Miss Universe, which owns the Miss USA organization, without success, she added. \u201cBoth young ladies were always trying to resolve any issues quietly behind the scenes,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe fact that Miss Universe Organization has not even responded to Noelia\u2019s resignation at this point is just stonewalling\u2026 No wonder things are falling apart. Because nobody knows what to do.\u201d The Miss Universe organization and Rose, through Miss USA, did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Voigt\u2019s pageant coach, Thom Brodeur, who has worked with Miss USA contestants since 1991 and began working with Voigt while she was preparing for Miss Utah, emphasized new and ominous territory for the organization under Rose. \u201cNo woman has ever resigned as Miss USA or as Miss Teen USA, and she\u2019s lost both of them in 48 hours,\u201d he said. Even before Voigt and Srivastava stepped down, there was turmoil in the organization, according to White, Brodeur and Miss USA\u2019s former social media director, Claudia Engelhardt, who also resigned in recent days. Engelhardt claimed on Instagram that she had worked without pay for two months after being hired, and that she had seen a \u201cdecline\u201d in Voigt\u2019s mental health, and witnessed \u201cdisrespect\u201d toward Srivastava and members of her family. And according to Engelhardt, they were far from the only members of the Miss USA organization to depart. When she began her role in January, she was part of an already small team of five employees. Now, she says, after multiple firings and resignations, the team is down to Rose and one other employee. Multiple sources said the turnover has been constant. \u201cThis is not a state pageant. This is not a local pageant. You need\u2026 a whole team,\u201d Engelhardt said in a phone call with CNN. Engelhardt said she believed she was applying for a freelance role, and was surprised to find she was being hired as staff. Still, she claimed, she received no employee contract, no onboarding and no guidance. There was no one else to help her manage the day-to-day social media needs of the national brand, she said, and often came up against what she framed as Rose\u2019s overbearing approach to their social accounts. \u201cShe would block Instagram accounts with people that she had personal discrepancies with. She would censor comments, and she would leave comments for the Miss USA page as if she was Noelia,\u201d Engelhardt claimed. White also alleged that Rose impersonated the two pageant winners on their official accounts. Weeks before Voigt resigned, she announced in a now-deleted Instagram post on her personal account that she \u201cno longer had access\u201d to her Miss USA pages. An uneasy path forward Engelhardt said she witnessed firsthand the impact of the role on Voigt, who she considers a friend as well as a former colleague. \u201c(I saw) how stressed out she would get when the owner would constantly bombard her with emails,\u201d she recalled. \u201cShe was constantly living in an anxious state.\u201d But despite the day-to-day stressors, Voigt alleged that she only made few public appearances. She said in her letter that, aside from a handful of press interviews in Los Angeles following her win and subsequent ones in Utah, the state she had represented at the Miss USA pageant, she had \u201cyet to make an appearance outside of Sarasota, Florida,\u201d where she was living. This was due to a \u201clack of communication\u201d that she found \u201cbaffling,\u201d she wrote. \u201cOur Miss USA, who should have been booked and busy (with) endless opportunities was sitting around doing nothing, and it\u2019s not because she didn\u2019t want to, but because of mismanagement,\u201d Engelhardt said. On May 9, the Miss USA pageant announced that Savannah Gankiewicz, Miss Hawaii USA 2023 and first-runner up to Voigt at the 2023 Miss USA pageant, would be taking over the national title and its responsibilities. She will be officially crowned on May 15. \u201cWe are proud to crown Savannah Miss USA 2023, A true representation of vision, intelligence, and compassion,\u201d Rose said in a statement. \u201cHer dedication to empowering women through self-love and confidence is inspiring, and we look forward to her impactful reign as Miss USA.\u201d \u201cI fully support and respect Noelia\u2019s decision to step down, and I stand in solidarity with mental health awareness,\u201d Gankiewicz\u00a0added. \u201cTo my fellow Miss USA sisters, I believe it\u2019s crucial for us to stand united for the future of the organization and the incoming class of 2024 and beyond.\u201d Though many have offered their public support for the two resigned pageant winners \u2014 including\u00a0Shanna Moakler, who oversaw Voigt\u2019s win in her role as the state director for the Miss Utah USA pageant, and Cindy Provost and Debbie Miller, who oversaw Srivastava\u2019s win in their role as state directors for the Miss New Jersey Teen USA pageant \u2014 Engelhardt and White both hope that others will step up to reveal more about what they see as a stifling culture, as well as potential legal ramifications, that are keeping the titleholders quiet. \u201cThey need somebody else to speak up for them,\u201d White said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/style/miss-usa-pageant-organization-allegations/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_style_india-elections-purple-voter-ink-intl-hnk", "text": "India\u2019s massive, twice-a-decade exercise in democracy is once again leaving its mark on the country\u2019s people, in the form of purple-streaked index fingers. The Election Commission uses indelible ink, or \u201cvoter ink\u201d, to prevent fraud or duplicate votes. Once a voter arrives at the booth to cast their ballot and has their ID verified, the ink is painted across the top of their left index finger, leaving a stain that can take up to two weeks to wash off. It may be rudimentary, but the method has been so effective that it\u2019s been in place for more than seven decades. \u201cRight from the prime minister to the most common person, everybody flashes their (marked) finger,\u201d said K Mohammed Irfan, managing director of Mysore Varnish and Paints Limited (MVPL), the state-owned company that exclusively makes and distributes the liquid to polling booths across the nation. \u201cFrom celebrities to film stars\u2026 (it has become) a mark of democracy that I think is synonymous with elections,\u201d he told CNN in a video interview. More than 960 million people are eligible to vote in India\u2019s election, the world\u2019s biggest. And workers at the company\u2019s factory in Mysuru, a city in southwestern Karnataka state, have spent months preparing nearly 2.7 million ink\u00a0vials, its largest order to date. The orange containers were filled and carefully packed for distribution ahead of this year\u2019s elections, which are underway and end\u00a0June 1. Each vial contains enough liquid to mark approximately 700 voters. The key to the ink\u2019s literal staying power? A tightly guarded formula which has remained unchanged since 1951. \u201cIndelible ink serves no other purpose,\u201d said Irfan. \u201cWe only manufacture the required quantity.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0While Irfan says the company is \u201cbound to secrecy\u201d when it comes to the ink\u2019s exact composition, it does contain the chemical compound silver nitrate, which causes a purplish stain when it comes into contact with skin and is exposed to sunlight. One dab at a time When newly independent India held its first-ever general elections in 1951 and 1952, organizers turned to the idea of using indelible ink to mark voters, in efforts to ensure a fair ballot. \u201cIn a country where there was no systematic registration of births, or identity documents, and with millions of people on the move as refugees, the question of how to prevent impersonation and double voting was a source of great concern,\u201d said Ornit Shani, author of \u201cHow India Became Democratic: Citizenship and the Making of the Universal Franchise.\u201d Some officials thought the method would take too much time and complicate the voting process, according to Shani, but public opinion eventually won out. \u201cCombined with the practice that all voters, irrespective of their caste, class and religions would stand in the same line, (having to wait) for their turn to have their finger marked (before they) cast their vote, further contributed to making concrete and visible the core value of the equality of the vote,\u201d Shani said in an email to CNN. \u201cOne man, one woman, one vote.\u201d Lasting appeal MVPL was founded as a paint supplier in 1937 by the then maharaja or ruler of Mysore, Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV, and retains that side\u00a0of its business. According to Irfan, when the company isn\u2019t producing ink, it\u2019s supplying, among other products, paint for the public transport sector. The ink\u2019s appeal has spilled beyond India\u2019s borders too. The company now supplies indelible ink to more than 35 countries, including to Ghana beginning in the late 1970s. However, Ghana\u2019s election commission recently announced it would phase out the use of indelible ink, opting for biometric verification methods instead. But the use of the ink in India doesn\u2019t appear to be going away any time soon. For Mukulika Banerjee, an associate professor of anthropology at the London School of Economics, the practice of marking a body may not translate well in other cultures, but it works in India due to common\u00a0cultural practices. \u201cPeople routinely have their hands decorated with henna, or women have their feet decorated with different colors,\u201d said Banerjee in a phone interview. \u201cI would argue that the marking of the finger (semi-permanently) kind of fits into it in a way that it might not fit in other contexts.\u201d She also pointed to an unintentional effect of marking voters with ink: creating an environment of peer pressure. Banerjee was able to find instances of this during her research on democracy and elections in West Bengal. \u201cFirst thing on polling day people do is check out each other\u2019s fingers,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if your left index finger is not carrying the indelible mark, they\u2019ll look at you and the first thing they\u2019ll say is \u2018Why haven\u2019t you voted?\u2019 \u201cYou can make excuses, but by the fifth time in the day, if somebody asks you and it gets so annoying, it\u2019s actually easier to go and vote than to not vote.\u201d The peer pressure extends to movie stars and athletes, who are likely to post their ink-stained fingers to their millions of fans on social media. \u201cThese guys have begun to hold up (their fingers) and take selfies of having voted and say \u2018I\u2019ve voted, have you?\u2019 because they feel they have a civic duty to encourage others to vote as well,\u201d she added. \u201cSo it becomes aspirational; then you want to be like your hero and you want to be able to do the same thing.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/india-elections-purple-voter-ink-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "style_alopecia-in-art-history-wellness", "text": "At least 40% of women experience\u00a0hair loss or alopecia over their lifetimes. This could be alopecia areata (patchy hair loss), traction alopecia (strained hair loss) or another form. The different ways that women\u2019s hair loss has been depicted across art history demonstrates the many different ways it has been interpreted over the years. In 16th and 17th century Britain, for example, women\u2019s alopecia was sometimes interpreted as\u00a0retribution for sins, including adultery. Some historical art, however, depicts a more neutral, or even positive, attitude towards women\u2019s alopecia. In religious or mythical art, it was sometimes idealized as divine. \u201cMadonna and Child\u201d (pictured top), painted in the 15th century by Italian Renaissance artist Carlo Crivelli, shows Jesus and Mary embracing in a gold, stylized setting. The pair sit behind a religious altar surrounded by ripe fruit and adorned with halos. Madonna has a high forehead and her blonde hair recedes, particularly on her right temple. This association between alopecia and divinity is echoed in a work by another Renaissance Italian artist, Cosm\u00e8 Tura. His\u00a0\u201dMadonna and Mary Magdalene\u201d\u00a0(circa 1490) depicts both mother and child with prominent foreheads. A glazed terracotta piece created by the Italian sculptor Andrea della Robbia in 1475 features Prudence, a human embodiment of Christian morality, as a balding two-headed person. Baldness in women has been connected to the divine for various reasons. It took the emphasis off of personal appearance in favour of deeper, more spiritual, priorities. But intentional hair removal played a role too. For some religious people, such as Buddhist nuns and Haredi Jewish wives, a bald head is thought to be\u00a0purer\u00a0and shaving can represent a\u00a0regular, sacrificial ritual. Ancient depictions Artwork on the walls of the tomb of the ancient Egyptian pharaoh, Akhenaten who ruled from 1351 to 1334 B.C., depicts two of his daughters, naked, with bald heads. Head shaving as well as natural baldness was common among the ancient Egyptians, including women. In fact, ancient Egyptians had\u00a0distinct terms\u00a0for female and male alopecia. This attests to just how common baldness, head shaving and wig wearing were for both sexes in ancient Egypt. And it isn\u2019t just Egypt. Partial and full head shaving has historically been common among women across sub-Saharan Africa. As\u00a0one traveller observed\u00a0among the inhabitants of the 18th century Kingdom of Issini (modern-day Ghana): \u201cSome only shave one half of the head \u2026 Others leave broad patches here and there unshaved.\u201d Medieval and Renaissance alopecia The 15th century painting, \u201cPortrait of a Woman with a Man at a Casement,\u201d by the Italian artist, Fra Filippo Lippi, features an aristocratic profile of a woman facing a man. She has a prominent forehead and high hairline. The appearance of recessed frontal hairlines in Medieval and Renaissance Europe\u00a0may have been fashionable\u00a0and even considered a sign of intelligence, encouraging customs of forehead shaving and eyebrow plucking. The 16th century queen of England, Elizabeth I, was often painted in this way.\u00a0One undated oil portrait\u00a0of the British monarch depicts her in bejeweled robes, with a pearl emblazoned veil and a prominent forehead. The removal of female bodily hair at this time, including on the forehead, wasn\u2019t just a matter of fashion. It also arguably arose due to patriarchal ideas that women\u2019s body hair was\u00a0dirty and even dangerous to men. Modern alopecia Adverts\u00a0and\u00a0research\u00a0today tend to discuss hair loss exclusively through medical terms, as a kind of detrimental disease. A recent\u00a0BBC article\u00a0refers to people with alopecia areata as \u201cpatients\u201d and their experience of it as \u201cprofoundly challenging\u201d. This certainly reflects some experiences, but not those who interpret their hair loss more neutrally, or even with\u00a0pride. Pharmaceutical and cosmetic products are promoted as \u201cnecessary\u201d treatments. A newly licensed drug, litfulo or ritlecitinib, was\u00a0hailed\u00a0last month as the \u201cfirst treatment\u201d and \u201cmedicine\u201d for alopecia. But as many forms of alopecia are not delimiting and as the \u201ctreatments\u201d on offer have limited efficacy and potential safety issues, this should\u00a0not be the default response. For example, the\u00a0European Medicine Agency\u00a0notes that ritlecitinib results in 80% hair regrowth but only for 36% of people taking it. About 10% are at risk of diarrhea, acne and throat infections. Another study\u00a0noted that\u00a0similar alopecia drugs, that operate through immunosuppression, only seem to work if they are taken continuously, yet their long-term safety has not been established. Depictions of alopecia throughout art history are a reminder of the many complicated ways women\u2019s hair loss has been viewed. Sometimes weaponized as a way to shame women, sometimes venerated as a sign of the divine, the truth is that hair loss really indicates nothing about a woman\u2019s worth, morality or status. But historical depictions of women\u2019s alopecia and baldness provide hope. They show that alopecia has been conceptualized differently at different times. This means the current framing of alopecia as an inevitably disadvantaging disease in need of certain \u201ctreatments\u201d might be biased too. They suggest if our societal interpretation of alopecia improves (as something that shouldn\u2019t be stigmatized), then so too may the individual experience (as something that shouldn\u2019t be dreaded).", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/alopecia-in-art-history-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_style_elle-fanning-met-gala-balmain-lotw", "text": "To some, arriving at an important event naked is the stuff of nightmares. For others, it\u2019s a meticulously planned reality. For Elle Fanning, who showed up to Monday night\u2019s Met Gala in a completely transparent Balmain gown, it was the latter. Radiant, gleaming and gossamer, the actor looked like she was one false step away from shattering. According to Balmain, the frock\u2019s organza fabric was hand-covered with four layers of resin to achieve a glass effect. The resulting garment conjured images of the precious \u201ccrystalline flowers\u201d used to reverse the clock in JG Ballard\u2019s 1962 short story, \u201cThe Garden of Time\u201d (this year\u2019s Met Gala theme). But Fanning wasn\u2019t the only celebrity embracing a full-frontal look. Emily Ratajkowski, Kim Kardashian, Doja Cat, Phoebe Dyvenor, Greta Lee and even Eddie Redmayne all wore sheer outfits onto the red carpet, often with nothing but strategically placed embroidery or crystal embellishing to protect their modesty. Behold: The naked dress (or in Redmayne\u2019s case, naked suit). Designs that hint, some more subtly than others, at the wearer\u2019s nudity have become a mainstay on celebrity red carpets and runways. Doja Cat and Miley Cyrus both donned barely-there nude gowns at the Grammy Awards in February; while at the Oscars in March Jennifer Lawrence, Vanessa Hudgens, Florence Pugh, Kendall Jenner, Ice Spice, Charli XCX, Charlize Theron and Iris Law reminded us of the many varieties of a naked dress \u2014 from transparent lace to crystal netting. On the Spring-Summer 2024 catwalks, too, see-through skirts were spotted at almost every show, from Prada to Erdem, Acne Studios to Dior. But this preoccupation with sartorial teasing is not new. In 1962, Hollywood actor Carroll Baker was photographed in one of the first ever naked dresses \u2014 also designed by Balmain. Baker\u2019s breasts were covered (for the most part) with two embellished pasties sewn onto a sheer torso panel, while embroidered beads and sequins trimmed the sleeves, the neckline and covered the entire skirt. It was a custom look, created specifically for Baker by Pierre Balmain at his atelier in Paris. \u201c(Baker) particularly likes muslin dresses with sparkles placed at the critical points,\u201d wrote ELLE magazine in 1964. \u201cShe already has seven. Balmain just designed the 8th one.\u201d Today\u2019s abundance of nude gowns can sometimes make the red carpet look more like a Spencer Tunick photograph. But in the early days of these peek-a-boo garments, wearers still managed to ruffle a few feathers. Particularly in Baker\u2019s case, when she arrived one October evening at the Plaza cinema in London for the premiere of her latest film \u201cThe Carpetbaggers\u201d (1964). Her sheer Balmain dress turned heads \u2014 and generated headlines. \u201cCarroll goes to the show \u2014 almost topless,\u201d wrote British tabloid the Daily Mirror. \u201cIt\u2019s about as near as you can get to a topless dress without actually being topless.\u201d Balmain\u2019s \u201ctransparent\u201d dresses, as he called them, were some of the first high-fashion naked dresses to garner widespread attention (Yves Saint Laurent didn\u2019t create his first full-sheer look until 1966). In the 1960s, women\u2019s fashion in America and Europe was changing at a rapid pace thanks, in part, to the sexual liberation movement and the gradual introduction of the contraceptive pill. Mary Quant devised the scandalous mini skirt, while Edie Sedgwick rejected bottoms altogether \u2014 favoring instead an underwear and tights combo that is still referenced today. Although, Baker\u2019s barely-there dress may have been more than just a sign of the times. In 1964 \u2014 just a few months before her \u201ctopless\u201d moment at London\u2019s Plaza cinema \u2014 the New York Times called Baker \u201cthe most controversial female star in Hollywood,\u201d namely for her perceived comfort with on-screen nudity. Nudity was strictly censored in US films by the Production Code Administration, an independent body which relied on distributors to help enforce standards. After the Paramount Decrees in 1948 \u2014 a landmark ruling that forced companies such as Paramount, Fox, MGM and Warner Brothers to divest from theaters \u2014 cinemas were suddenly liberated from the thumb of powerful studios. By the 1960s, a nudity violation raised by the Production Code Administration meant a lot less than it did 20 years ago, as cinemas had the final decision on whether to run the film or not. Baker, according to the New York Times, had become \u201ca major target of heated arguments about nudity in American films.\u201d The actor responded nonchalantly and almost prophetically, \u201cI believe that in the next 10 years nudity will be accepted in movies\u2026 I do not think movie nudity will injure the national character.\u201d So while the press and wider world fizzed at Baker\u2019s on-screen state of undress, she decided to do one better, and give them a glimpse of the real thing. While Fanning\u2019s look was markedly less controversial than Baker\u2019s, it proved that even after six decades, the naked dress is still as relevant as ever.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/style/elle-fanning-met-gala-balmain-lotw/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "style_article_sunil-gupta-india-gate-snap", "text": "To passersby, the sight of two men embracing besides New Delhi\u2019s India Gate in 1986 might have seemed unremarkable. In a city where public displays of platonic male affection are relatively commonplace, it was photographer Sunil Gupta who attracted more attention at the time. \u201cMen holding hands or lying in each other\u2019s laps is not an issue \u2014 it looks very romantic from (the outside), but they\u2019re usually just hanging out,\u201d he said in a video interview from the UK, before recalling: \u201cI was creating more interest than them, because I was standing there with a tripod and a camera, so everybody was focused on me.\u201d Onlookers may not have realized, but Gupta was creating a subtly subversive image in what he has described as the \u201crepressive atmosphere\u201d of 1980s India. At a time when homosexuality was more taboo in the country than it is today \u2014 and with consensual gay sex then criminalized as an \u201cunnatural offense\u201d \u2014 the photographer had found his subjects via the informal networks constituting Delhi\u2019s gay scene. The pair in question had chosen the war monument\u2019s gardens for their photo shoot due to its reputation as a cruising spot.  Having lived in New Delhi until his mid-teens, London-based Gupta knew this from personal experience. \u201cI passed that place on my way to school every day for 11 years,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just had to hop off the bus and get laid on your way home. It was very easy.\u201d The image forms part of the photographer\u2019s series \u201cExiles,\u201d which was first exhibited in the UK in 1987 but is this week showing at the India Art Fair in New Delhi. Primarily shot outdoors around India\u2019s capital, it captures gay men sat on benches or in public places popular among those looking for casual sexual partners, their faces often out of shot or turned away from the camera. Concerned about \u201couting\u201d his subjects, Gupta treated them as collaborators in what he called a \u201cconstructed documentary\u201d approach. After shooting his images and developing the film in London, he returned to Delhi with printed contact sheets to ensure the men were comfortable with the pictures he selected for his show. \u201cThere was quite a bit of horsing around in the pictures,\u201d he said of the India Gate shoot. \u201cAnd there were other photos that were (more suggestive)\u2026 So I picked a somewhat tamer one to put in the series.\u201d The other ethical challenge, he recalled, was communicating to the duo how the images would be used \u2014 and the art of photography itself. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t for publication, and the only way they saw pictures was in a magazine, so it took some explaining,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThen I tried to explain the process.\u201d Photography for many at the time, Gupta observed, was still \u201ca very mysterious thing that only a few people did in a darkroom.\u201d   For \u2018the canon\u2019  Now among India\u2019s most celebrated photographic artists, Gupta often addressed LGBTQ experiences in his explorations of race, immigration and identity. While studying in the US in the mid-1970s he produced a now-celebrated series of photos from New York\u2019s Christopher Street that captured the city\u2019s gay scene in the years between the Stonewall Riots and onset of the AIDS epidemic. Although \u201cExiles\u201d presented a rare portrait of gay life outside the West, Gupta\u2019s intended audience was always back in London. Homophobia was rife in 1980s Britain, and the photographer said he faced \u201ca lot of hostility\u201d at art school for making work relating to his sexuality. \u201cI couldn\u2019t make gay work, and I couldn\u2019t make gay work about India, especially,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was none in the library for reference. So, I thought, \u2018I\u2019m making it my mission to make some. Not for India, but for this canon \u2014 we need to have gay Indian guys in our library, in our art schools, over here.\u2019\u201d New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art has since acquired several of the pictures for its permanent collection, signifying the series\u2019 place in contemporary photography. But it was not an instant success. \u201cIt didn\u2019t have any impact when it was first shown,\u201d Gupta said of its debut.  \u201cI think it was too early.\u201d By the 1990s, however, interest in Gupta\u2019s work was growing, as art made by, and about, gay people of color became increasingly visible in the West. The fact that \u201cExiles\u201d is now showing in India, where he said it is positively received, is testament to changes on the subcontinent, too.  Although the country\u2019s LGBTQ communities still face significant social stigma, gay sex was decriminalized in 2018 and the arrival of apps like Grindr have been transformative, Gupta said. (\u201cThose sorts of chance meetings behind the bush are not happening \u2014 or maybe happening less,\u201d he added). This modern context and the power of hindsight have helped paint the photos in a new light. \u201cI think it has become historical enough that people are curious about what gay life was like before Grindr and the internet,\u201d Gupta said. \u201cPeople think it was all doom and gloom, and people jumping off buildings. They don\u2019t seem to appreciate that we also managed to have some kind of a life back then.\u201d This is a message reflected in the photographer\u2019s carefree India Gate shoot, which he recounts as a relaxed day of fun and abundant sunlight. \u201cIt just seemed very pleasurable. It was a nice day out, and I got to hang out with these guys who were having a good time and having a laugh.\u201d \u201cExiles\u201d is showing via Vadehra Art Gallery at India Art Fair, which runs February 9-12 in New Delhi, India. A book of outtakes from the series, published by Aperture, is available now.", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/article/sunil-gupta-india-gate-snap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "style_article_reuben-wu-landscape-photography", "text": "The first time Reuben Wu saw the warm sandstone hues and vast, open skies of the American West, he was watching the landscapes pass him by from the window of a tour bus.  The British visual artist, now based in Chicago, has become known for his sublime imagery of remote landscapes using drone lighting, enhancing craggy peaks with halos, or writing glyphs in the sky like signals from a supernatural entity. But for a long time, art was just a passion project while he focused on a music career as one of the four members of the synth-pop band Ladytron. \u201c(Photography) started as an all-consuming hobby,\u201d he explained in a phone interview. But when Ladytron took a break in 2011 after five studio albums (they released a self-titled sixth album in 2019, and the seventh, \u201cTime\u2019s Arrow,\u201d this month), he began a new career from scratch. \u201cWhile the others did their own solo projects, making their own music and releasing their own albums, this was my solo project.\u201d Wu\u2019s imagery takes a classic photographer\u2019s combination \u2014 light and landscape \u2014 and marries the two in transformative ways. He often begins with dusky evening light or the ink-black shadows of night, then strategically illuminates portions of the scene with custom-built consumer drones. In one image, a bright horizontal line hangs over a glacier in the Peruvian Andes, revealing the brilliance of the ice against a dark sky. In a different motion piece, Wu simulated an electrical storm in Goblin Valley, Utah, but with perfectly straight strikes of light rather than the jagged bursts of lightning.  The artist\u2019s 2018 photo book \u201cLux Noctis\u201d is in the collections of the Guggenheim and Museum of Modern Art, in New York, and he has shot commercial work for Apple, Audi and Google as well as the DJ and music producer Zedd. Last summer, Wu revealed a colossal project for National Geographic: a cover story and timelapse multimedia piece about Stonehenge, which featured the enigmatic monument lit by his custom drones. In November, one of his NFTs, a 4K video loop titled \u201cAn Irresistible Force,\u201d outperformed its high estimate by over 25% during an auction at Sotheby\u2019s Hong Kong, selling at 441,000 HKD (about $56,500). \u201cI couldn\u2019t have dreamed of where I am now,\u201d Wu said. \u201cI just wanted to be able to make a living from doing art and from doing photography.\u201d  Alien inspiration Wu has always been drawn to wild, remote places where he could find solitude. His parents immigrated from Hong Kong to the UK before he was born, and he grew up an introverted child in Liverpool, he said, who didn\u2019t quite click with school. He was fascinated with science-fiction films that mix the alien with the everyday, such as Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind,\u201d which featured Wyoming\u2019s Devils Tower as a site for extraterrestrial contact. (Unfamiliar with American topography, he initially thought the butte, a national monument, was a fictional geological entity, he explained with a laugh).  The film\u2019s visuals of remote desert scenes mixed with eerie lights have been a formative inspiration in his own work. \u201c(It\u2019s) cemented into my brain, the idea of these seemingly impossible lights moving through the sky, kind of like search lights on very ordinary (American) landscapes,\u201d he said.  He embarked on his first cross-country photography trip across the US in 2013, around a decade after getting a taste on the road with Ladytron. The resulting series featured vivid depictions of the Grand Canyon and South Dakota Badlands, as well as a time-lapse image of Devils Tower at night among star trails.  Two years later, Wu discovered the effect that drone lighting could have on the natural world while working on an outdoor automotive shoot. \u201cI flew the drone up above some cliffs, and I was absolutely fascinated by the effect it had on the actual landscape,\u201d he explained. It made the cliffs glow, reaching areas that were otherwise impossible to light artificially.  Wu rigs lights on drones to suit his needs on any given shoot or project. The first iteration, he said, which he used when the technology was still nascent, was a \u201cmassive\u201d eight-rotor drone outfitted with homemade lights that only had about eight minutes of flight time. The next used a 3D-printed bracket with an LED hot light, but still only gave him an additional two minutes in the air. The tech he uses now gives him a bit more breathing room, with a half hour to fly out, capture images and return to him, but he\u2019s had to learn to work within the bounds of each set-up. \u201cI\u2019m a lot less anxious now, because I\u2019ve crashed a number of drones,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in the end, they\u2019re just tools.\u201d  Experimental series After developing series of still images such as \u201cLux Noctis\u201d and \u201cAeroglyphs,\u201d which experiment with ghostly lighting and geometric shapes in the skies, Wu found himself wanting to incorporate motion and sound into his work because of his own background in music. He began creating 15-second video loops from his images, showing light beams forming patterns or the moon arcing across the sky, to the beats of atmospheric electronic music that he produced. \u201cThese (works) were very much experimental and had no end goal \u2014 they were just things that I did for love out of love,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t license them, I couldn\u2019t print them\u2026 and so they were just there, stacking likes on my Instagram.\u201d But in January 2021, Wu found a way to make them a more substantial part of his career when he was introduced to NFT art. He minted his first \u201cnon-fungible token\u201d  on the marketplace Foundation two months later \u2014 an \u201caeroglyph\u201d of bright lines forming a rectangle above a beachside cliff. It sold for 30 ETH ($45,000), a portion of which he donated to the National Parks Conservation Association and the AAPI Community Fund. Later that year, the web3 arts organization Obscura commissioned him to produce a new set of images titled \u201cAeroglyph Variations,\u201d which took him into the New Mexico badlands for a 20-hour shoot that resulted in 55 images of the same setting, each with different lighting conditions and patterns. Wu has also experimented with presenting the work in different ways, from animations, to AR experiences, to projection mapping moving images onto physical prints. \u201cIt\u2019s very much a hybrid medium, and so I\u2019d like to expand that horizon even more, and think about the end goal for my work,\u201d he said. \u201cAm I creating a nice piece of art for people to look at and appreciate, or am I creating an experience for people to share?\u201d Wu is leaning towards the latter as he continues to experiment with the form his work takes, but no matter the medium, his vision of and approach to the natural world remains consistent. \u201cA lot of people always say that my work is otherworldly \u2014 that is the first word that people think of when they think about my work,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not trying to create an alien-looking image; I\u2019m trying to show that this is our planet. And there are so many new ways that are available to see it that can renew your perspective.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/article/reuben-wu-landscape-photography/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_04_19_style_china-luxury-watches", "text": "When the luxury Watches and Wonders fair closed its doors in Geneva earlier this week, it had hosted an estimated 49,000 luxury watch enthusiasts and collectors from around the world, all eager to be inspired by the best new designs and complications. According to a report by the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry (FHS), mainland China and Hong Kong combined spent over 5 billion Swiss francs (5.49 billion) on watches in 2023, meaning luxury consumers in greater China are the biggest clients when it comes to the 26.7 billion franc (29.3 billion) watch exports business. But one region\u2019s visitors stood out among the crowd \u2014 40% of this year\u2019s attendees hailed from Asia according to the event\u2019s CEO Matthieu Humair, with a significant portion coming from China. Watching your wealth It\u2019s not surprising. Despite economic challenges looming large \u2014 including prolonged downturns in both the housing and stock market \u2014 China\u2019s fascination with luxury watches remains undiminished. In fact, luxury watches are seen by many affluent Chinese as a compelling alternative investment avenue during times of financial uncertainty, when diversifying away from \u201ctraditional\u201d investment\ufeffs such as real estate or stocks is seen as prudent. Certainly at this year\u2019s fair, well-dressed, well-accessorized Chinese customers appeared unfazed by economic uncertainties. Mostly invited by brands, these high-spending VIP guests often pay millions for timepieces or jewelry, either at home in China or during overseas travels. Accordingly, Chinese brand ambassadors were also front and center at this year\u2019s fair, with appearances by actors such as Jackson Yee at Jaeger Le-Coultre, Zhu Yilong at Chopard and Wang Yang at IWC. Other personalities including actor and singer Xiao Zhan conducted livestream sessions that\u00a0enthusiasts could tune into. David Sadigh is CEO of Digital Luxury Group, a digital marketing agency in Europe and China whose clients include Patek Philippe and Van Cleef & Arpels. After more than 20 years working in the region, he believes China\u2019s economic slowdown is just a temporary phase. \u201cThe higher-end price point brands are not concerned (by the downturn),\u201d Sadigh told CNN during an interview at the fair in Geneva. \u201cThe situation may be slightly (more) challenging for mid-level luxury brands (whose clients\u2019 disposable incomes are potentially more at the whim of market forces). But I\u2019m confident that in the long run, China will be the biggest market for luxury watches.\u201d Many executives of the 54 watchmaking brands that CNN spoke to at Watches and Wonders echoed this sentiment, expressing confidence in China\u2019s ongoing passion for luxury timepieces and underscoring the resilience of this market segment amid the broader economic headwinds. Sales at Hublot, a prominent luxury watch brand in the LVMH stable, have this year rebounded to pre-pandemic levels, although growth rates have slowed compared to the peak of post-pandemic \u201crevenge spending\u201d (a phenomenon whereby customers rush to spend more than they usually would on something after being deprived of the ability to do so)\u00a0in 2022. Despite commanding price tags sometimes into the millions of yuan, the brand continues to attract discerning consumers, with US and China as its biggest clients. \u201cIt\u2019s understandable that people wait and see how to spend their money when the market is down,\u201d said Hublot CEO Ricardo Guadalupe. \u201cFor the Chinese consumers, once they consume, they will come back, because they appreciate luxury watches from the bottom of their heart.\u201d Indeed, despite being a relatively new market for watchmakers, wealthy Chinese customers are already regarded as discerning clients alongside buyers from more mature markets like Europe and the US, who have long appreciated the artistry, elegance, and craftsmanship in haute horology. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen in Asia \u2014 China in particular \u2014 average consumers are younger, around 35 (and) have an eye for unusual designs,\u201d said Guadalupe. Carson Chan, a timepiece expert whose previous titles include General Manager of Richard Mille Asia, Bonhams\u2019 Head of Watches and Chief Advisor of Fondation de la Haute Horlogerie (FHH), is also a collector. \u201cIn Asia, where collecting large items like cars can be challenging, watches offer a compact alternative for collectors,\u201d Chan told CNN in an email interview from his home in Hong Kong. \u201cThe strong learning culture and understanding of mechanisms in Asia further support a sophisticated market, evidenced by the rise of independent brands across the region,\u201d he added. Raphael Young, who also lives in Hong Kong and works in financial services in the IT industry, has just returned from the fair in Geneva. \u201cAs a watch collector, the five main criteria I look deeply into (are) value, craftsmanship, history, innovation and the people behind the timepieces and the brand,\u201d he told CNN via a phone interview and added; \u201cThere is a lot of learning, researching, meetings and almost scholarly pursuits involved in cultivating my collecting hobby.\u201d Timeless designs A. Lange & S\u00f6hne, a smaller independent watchmaker producing just 5,000 pieces globally, maintains a distinctive niche in the market. The brand\u2019s CEO Wilhelm Schmid also remained unperturbed by China\u2019s economic conditions. \u201cA. Lange\u2019s customers are real collectors; it\u2019s very niche. Though our price is not low, there are groups of clients whose finances are not affected by the market fluctuations, who just appreciate the best timepieces,\u201d he told CNN in an interview at the event. The house\u2019s new Datograph Perpetual Tourbillon Honeygold Lumen, for example, integrates a flyback chronograph, a jumping minute counter, perpetual calendar with outsized date and a tourbillon with a stop-seconds mechanism. Some watchmakers appear to be courting Chinese buyers through unique design flourishes and Chan has observed that smaller case sizes are trending. Eleven years in the making, Vacheron Constantin\u2019s record breaking one-piece-only giant pocket watch\u00a0The Berkley has been designed to celebrate cultural fusion by combining traditional Chinese lunar calendar functions with Western horological complexities \u2014 for example a perpetual calendar, minute repeater, and tourbillon. \u201cThe Berkley features the first Chinese perpetual calendar which, given the particularities of the complex and irregular cycle\u2026 is a feat of horological genius,\u201d said Young. \u201cChina has the longest continuous history of any country in the world (with) 3,500 years of written history, and it is only now we have a mechanical timepiece for the Chinese perpetual calendar. As a Chinese, I would find it useful and would be very interested in having such a complication.\u201d Meanwhile, renowned Swiss watchmaker Roger Dubuis created another novelty in celebration of the new Year of the Dragon, on display in Geneva earlier this week. Limited to eight pieces, it is expected to appeal to Chinese collectors and enthusiasts. Among some of the most popular luxury fashion brands in China \u2014 which also include Dior, Louis Vuitton and Gucci \u2014 Chanel and Hermes have joined the traditional watchmakers at the fair, expanding beyond fashion watches into the universe of high watchmaking. Herm\u00e8s unveiled the Arceau Duc Attel\u00e9 watch, featuring a sapphire dome top and new minute repeater; and Chanel debuted a 55-piece limited edition Mademoiselle J12 Couture watch featuring a dial adorned with the silhouette of Mademoiselle Chanel in a black and white suit, finished with 46 baguette-cut diamonds. Unlike volatile financial markets, watches offer tangible value combined with emotional attachment. Collectors appreciate the craftsmanship, rarity, and heritage associated with luxury timepieces, which can hold or increase in value over time. \u201cIn a world where everything is so connected, there\u2019s nothing more beautiful than a wristwatch powered by mechanical movement. It\u2019s timeless, a piece of art, something to pass down to generations.\u201d explained Humair. \u201cWe\u2019re very excited to see younger generations in Asia, especially China, show a lot of interest in watchmaking.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/19/style/china-luxury-watches/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_03_25_style_ukraine-3d-printed-school-warzone-dfi-hnk-spc-intl-hnk", "text": "With its soft gray lines and sleek, curving exterior, Project Hive looks less like a school and more like a wellness retreat or modern art museum. The structure\u2019s distinctive appearance, with a texture resembling a cocoon or the structure\u2019s namesake beehive, is down to the construction method used to build it: 3D printing. Standing less than 200 feet from School No.23 in Lviv, Ukraine, the walls of the 3,983-square-foot educational facility were printed in just 40 hours with a COBOD gantry printer, which follows digital blueprints to lay concrete like piping icing onto a cake. It\u2019s the first 3D-printed education center in Europe and the first building to be 3D-printed in a war zone, according to Jean-Christophe Bonis, founder of Team4UA, the non-profit responsible for the pilot project. \u201cI\u2019m not a builder; I don\u2019t want to be an architect or a developer\u2026 But through robotics and AI, through technology, we can accelerate the (building) process,\u201d Bonis told CNN in a video interview. Soon after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, places  like Lviv faced a huge problem: how to cope with tens of thousands of people fleeing to \u2014 and through \u2014 the city. In the Lviv region alone, there were 173,000 internally displaced people as of December last year, according to the latest figures from the United Nations\u2019 International Organization for Migration. Project Hive will provide the school with four extra classrooms to help it accommodate additional students displaced by the war, said Bonis. He hopes that, if successful, the project will enable \u201c3D printing to be one of the tools of local construction in Ukraine.\u201d Blackouts and bombings 3D-printed construction can be significantly faster and, some experts believe, more sustainable than traditional building methods. Team4UA collaborated with Ukrainian studio Balbek Bureau on the school\u2019s design, and architecture firm Ars Longa on the engineering. The single-story project broke ground in September 2022, and the entire project, from foundations to finishings, was originally expected to take just three months. But Russian air strikes and bombing across the country through October and November 2022 hit major civilian infrastructure, including the power grid, causing widespread blackouts in Lviv. With local communities turning to power generators, Project Hive was paused while electricity supply became unstable and conditions made it unsafe for the printer to be delivered. It wasn\u2019t until last summer that the situation stabilized in Lviv and the power supply was fully restored, finally allowing the printer to be delivered. Although it took less than two days, cumulatively, to print the building\u2019s concrete frame, Team4UA spread this across six weeks so it could deliver training and development sessions on site. After revising its opening date to January 2024, the project hit another roadblock: funding. Construction costs in Ukraine have risen sharply in the past year, and to complete the final finishing work, such as roofing, windows, doors and interior design, project organizers say they need to raise another $400,000. \u201cI\u2019m facing challenges on a daily basis,\u201d said Bonis. But he continues undeterred: \u201c(This) is also a way of taking technology to give back hope.\u201d A costly option As a relatively new technology, and with limited data on the resulting buildings\u2019 safety and stability, 3D-printed construction has predominately been used for one-off projects or research collaborations. Dutch architecture firm DUS has been experimenting with 3D-printed houses since 2015, and Texas-based construction firm ICON has 3D-printed entire communities in Austin, Texas and Nacajuca, Mexico. In 2020, the Dubai Future Foundation became the world\u2019s first 3D-printed commercial building, and in 2021, the world\u2019s first 3D-printed school was completed in Malawi, with the walls laid in just 18 hours. However, when it comes to large-scale construction, the technology is \u201cstill in its infancy,\u201d said Christian Lange, an associate architecture professor at Hong Kong University, where he oversees the Robotic Fabrication Lab. Lange is skeptical about the benefits of using 3D printing to build in regions with ongoing conflict or disruption. While technology has the potential to be cheaper than conventional building methods, the up-front costs of the printers can be extremely high, and their size can make them difficult and costly to move. According to Lange, there are cheaper, faster alternatives to 3D printing, such as prefabricated and modular buildings. Made using parts that are constructed in factories and quickly assembled on site, prefabs were popular in the early 20th century, when they were used to rebuild after World War II and provide cheap housing for displaced people. \u201cTemporary shelter doesn\u2019t need to be permanent shelter,\u201d said Lange in a phone interview. \u201cWhere 3D printing is really great is when you have special geometries and shapes, because you\u2019re totally free \u2014 the robot or the machine doesn\u2019t care if you build a straight wall or a curved wall.\u201d But in Ukraine, where many technicians, construction workers and industry experts are fighting on the front lines, automation may help counter labor shortages, said Olga Gavura, managing partner at 7CI Group, a contractor on Project Hive. \u201cThe fact this technology helps to build with a smaller number of specialists is a significant advantage,\u201d said Gavura, adding that just four experts were required for the construction phase of Project Hive. As Russian airstrikes continue to devastate the nation\u2019s infrastructure \u2014 2024 has already seen multiple attacks targeting cities, including Lviv, killing civilians and destroying homes \u2014 Gavura believes that, for the number of structures needing to be rebuilt, 3D printing will become essential. She believes pilots like Project Hive can not only test construction processes but will help train a generation of Ukrainian specialists who \u201ccan apply the technology, on their own, in future,\u201d she added. Reconstructing communities Team4UA is not the only organization to see the potential of 3D-printed construction in disaster and conflict zones. Arizona-based construction company Diamond Age is currently in discussion with Ukrainian officials about printing bomb shelters and military infrastructure, said the firm\u2019s CEO Jack Oslan. Diamond Age uses a patented 3D printing system that, it claims, insulates the buildings\u2019 walls. Oslan said his company\u2019s structures are 30% more energy efficient than those made from lumber frames and are strong enough to withstand a Category 5 hurricane or moderate earthquake. \u201cIt\u2019s this climate resiliency that gives us the perfect platform to transition into military and humanitarian applications,\u201d he said, adding that automation could help reduce casualities when building in war zones: \u201cThere (will) be fewer people in harm\u2019s way, which we think is important.\u201d Damage to Ukrainian infrastructure between Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion and September 2023 \u2014 including homes, schools, energy grids and transport networks \u2014 will cost an estimated $151.2 billion to replace, according to a\u00a0study by the Kyiv School of Economics. Researchers found that over 3,500 educational facilities were among the buildings damaged or destroyed, along with over 160,000 homes. Oslan sees huge opportunity for 3D printing to help begin rebuilding the nation. \u201cWe would expect that anything we deliver to Ukraine today to build military or humanitarian structures would ultimately transition into the building of homes, for the reconstruction of (the country\u2019s) communities,\u201d he added. \u2018A vision for this country\u2019 Back in Lviv, there\u2019s more excitement around Project Hive than one might expect for a primary school building, according to Bonis. \u201cWhen I\u2019m on the site, I have children coming to me with their parents and telling me in Ukrainian, \u2018I will be in this school, I\u2019m so excited, my school is unique in the country\u2019,\u201d he said. In an email to CNN, the head of Lviv City Council\u2019s education department, Andriy Zakaliuk, said the project offered \u201ca unique opportunity\u201d to custom-build an environment for young students. \u201cIt is symbolic that they will begin their new stage of life in a new, modern environment,\u201d said Zakaliuk. \u201cNow these children have the opportunity to see that, with the help of a 3D printer, you can build real buildings.\u201d While he awaits  yet another revised opening date for the new school building, Bonis is already planning two more ambitious 3D printing projects \u2014 a bridge in Kherson, and an eight-story building in the center of Kyiv. Team4UA hopes these pilot schemes can help it increase its speed and efficiency while cutting costs for future projects. Bonis is meanwhile establishing a private company that will purchase two 3D printers to offer \u201cprinting as a service\u201d in Ukraine, with profits helping to support Team4UA\u2019s humanitarian aid work. \u201cIt\u2019s not only a concept of printing a school \u2014 it\u2019s a vision for this country,\u201d said Bonis. \u201cThis war will be over sooner or later. At that moment, we need to get back to life, to build back and turn the page.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/25/style/ukraine-3d-printed-school-warzone-dfi-hnk-spc-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_04_24_style_luxury-pre-owned-watches", "text": "What\u2019s old is new again, and the longstanding phrase couldn\u2019t be more apropos when it comes to pre-owned and vintage luxury watches by the likes of Rolex, Patek Philippe and Audemars Piguet \u2014 or \u201cAP,\u201d if you\u2019re in the know. \u201cThe demand is so high, and the supply is so low,\u201d said Sotheby\u2019s veteran and creative consultant Brynn Wallner, who founded the women-focused luxury watch resource Dimepiece in 2020. The stats don\u2019t lie: According to a March 2023 study on the second hand luxury watch market by Boston Consulting Group (BCG), \u201cnearly 95% of (rare and collectible limited edition) watches are no longer in production.\u201d \u201cThe level of excitement is even higher when a watch gets discontinued,\u201d explained Tim Stracke, founder and fhairman of Chrono24, in an interview at Watches and Wonders 2024 in Geneva. \u201cIt\u2019s like when you go to a concert, a rock concert, you want to hear the classics. It\u2019s the same with watches, you love the classics.\u201d Acquiring a second hand watch today is often about the uniqueness of a particular model \u2014 and the clout that comes with it. \u201cWe have a lot of connoisseurs and very established clients who buy certified pre-owned from us because they\u2019re looking for specific pieces,\u201d said Carina Ertl, chief marketing officer of the Swiss luxury watch retailer Bucherer, adding that rare, limited edition pre-owned watches can be \u201cequal\u201d (in value and actual cost) to a new one. Granted, the pandemic-induced second hand luxury watch boom peaked back in March 2022, but the market is still going strong, and price levels remain higher than pre-Covid times. \u201cIn the grand scheme of things, prices are increasing \u2014 especially when you look at prices in the primary market,\u201d said Stracke, \u201cand the price level of the primary market is one of the key driving forces of the prices of the secondary market\u2026. We expect in the long term the secondary prices to remain stable \u2014 and go up again.\u201d Experts furthermore predict a return to stability for 2024, and millennials and Gen Z buyers are integral in keeping the momentum going. \u201c(They\u2019re) a crucial demographic for the growth and evolution of the pre-owned and vintage luxury watch industry,\u201d added Paul Altieri, founder & CEO of multi-brand online luxury marketplace Bob\u2019s Watches. The BCG study found that 54% of Gen Z and younger millennials\u00a0surveyed had upped their spending on high-end timepieces from 2021 to 2023, thanks to factors including increased accessibility of buying and selling, investment opportunities and the appeal of community, whether in-person or, of course, on social media platforms like TikTok. There\u2019s also a greater gender balance apparent among these consumers. \u201cMillennial and Gen Z women have been a big part of luxury growth (for pre-owned watches) over the last few years,\u201d added Ertl. \u201cGen Z women in particular are embracing luxury goods in a different way than other generations, and buying goods earlier at a younger age.\u201d Brands which have historically focused on men are adjusting their strategies.\u00a0In June 2023, Ginny Wright, chief executive of the Americas for Audemars Piguet, told Vogue Business: \u201cWe have a much better understanding of what women consider and how they purchase watches differently than their male counterparts. In the US, we are targeting female entrepreneurs and executives from Gen Z to Gen X.\u201d But how \u2014 and where \u2014 to gear up for the glittering, but possibly overwhelming world of luxury second hand watches? Ahead, insiders share their expert knowledge. How can you tell if a luxury pre-owned watch is the real deal? Whether you\u2019re dropping four digits on a Rolex Datejust or six-plus on an Audemars Piguet Royal Oak, you\u2019ll want to know you\u2019re buying genuine goods. \u201cThe first step is to find a trusted retailer, because there\u2019s a lot of options out there,\u201d said Bucherer\u2019s vice president of CPO, David Hong. The term \u201cCPO\u201d \u2014 industry shorthand for certified pre-owned \u2014 means that the brand itself has authenticated the watch as their own, thus also guaranteeing they will officially service it in the future. Bucherer introduced its CPO offerings in 2019, with a two-year guarantee and a trade-in program. The retailer has also officially partnered with Rolex, which launched its own certification program last year. \u201cWe have everything expertly restored,\u201d said Ertl. \u201cEverything goes through multiple steps of services.\u201d (Bucherer sources CPO stock through its in-house \u201cBuy and Trade\u201d program, plus \u201ca network of sources,\u201d Ertl added.) Other luxury brands with in-house pre-owned certification programs include Richard Mille, MB&F and FP Journe; Audemars Piguet has one in the works and Jaeger LeCoultre has unveiled a capsule of rare vintage gems, The Collectibles. (Depending on whom you ask, experts consider watches made 20 to 25 years ago to be \u201cvintage,\u201d and \u201cpre-owned\u201d to be more contemporary models.) Where can \u2014 and should \u2014 you buy a certified pre-owned watch? \u201cCPO is the safest way to do it,\u201d said Wallner of a vintage or pre-owned luxury watch purchase, suggesting the option in particular for first-timers seeking absolute reassurance. \u201cBut it\u2019s probably going to be more costly.\u201d To compare, a pre-owned Rolex Submariner 16610 circa 1991 from US-based Tourneau (acquired by Bucherer in 2018) is priced at $11,500, while Bob\u2019s Watches sells the model for $10,195. The latter Newport Beach-based retailer, which specializes in Rolex but is not an authorized dealer, has its own \u201cmulti-tiered\u201d authentication and restoration process, and collaborates with Swiss watch authentication service WatchCSA in lieu of the official watch brands. The BCG study also points to third party online marketplaces like Chrono24, WatchBox, and Watchfinder, which Richemont bought in 2018, as popular with Gen Z and millennial shoppers. But, \u201cyou\u2019re taking risks no matter what (for non-CPO purchases),\u201d said Wallner, who recently bought a Rolex Datejust from luxury consignment retailer Rebag \u2014 with a safeguard in mind. Clocking the site\u2019s 14-day return policy, she immediately took her purchase to the authorized Rolex dealer Watches of Switzerland. \u201cThey were like, \u2018Yeah, this is in great condition. It\u2019s authentic. Great work,\u2019\u201d she added. Otherwise, she stocks her vintage timepiece collection in large part through  Foundwell, a dealership in high-end vintage watches, jewelry and decor whose selections are carried at Bergdorf Goodman, Harrods and Club Monaco London locations.\u00a0Seasoned collectors often work directly with trusted dealers, found through recommendations and word-of-mouth. What fashion \u2014 and investment \u2014 trends should you consider ? \u201cThe most resounding piece of advice anybody in the watch industry will give is \u2018Buy what you love. Don\u2019t pay attention to the trends,\u2019\u201d said Wallner. It\u2019s important to find a piece that fits with your day-to-day routine: Could a Chopard 44mm Mille Miglia inhibit typing on your Airbook all day? How often would you really wear a dainty \u201860s-era gold diamond and sapphire framed Blancpain? Beyond that, consider how you want to power your watch, for example: A quartz battery-run timepiece or a self-winding or automatic mechanical movement?\u00a0(Rolex makes both.) Depending on your sense of style, you may prefer a larger size case \u2014 the part that holds the movement and dial \u2014 and decide between a stainless steel or leather strap. Bucherer\u2019s plush CPO lounge in New York welcomes people to peruse, converse with an expert and, no pun intended, take their time when it comes to making a purchase. \u201cThe idea is to fall in love with the watch,\u201d said Hong, a process which can take a few dates. Hong often encounters clients expressing sentimental motivations in their search for a pre-owned timepiece. \u201cWe get a lot of stories where people will walk in and talk about their past,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might be a watch as old as my grandfather or great grandfather.\u201d Just don\u2019t ask him about purchasing an \u201cinvestment watch,\u201d though \u2014 Hong holds a more sentimental attachment to timepiece collecting. \u201cLuxury watches of this caliber will go from one generation to the next to the next to the next,\u201d he explained. The BCG study does segment second-hand buyers into four categories, including the \u201cCollector/Investor,\u201d which is described as high income young millennials with a penchant for copping and flipping \u201cultra-luxury watches.\u201d They represent 44% of watch buyers and dominate 58% of the market by value. But Wallner agrees with Hong. \u201cDefinitely don\u2019t buy to flip,\u201d she said. \u201cSpeculation is a losing game.\u201d She may have a point: according to Bloomberg\u2019s Subdial Watch Index, only two Rolex models \u2014 \u201cPepsi\u201d GMT Master II and Lady-Datejust \u2014 increased in price last year. (\u201cRolex, in many cases, is seen as a harder currency that the Euro or the US Dollar in recent years,\u201d noted Chrono24\u2019s Stracke.) Plus, the practice just seems to go against connoisseur etiquette. \u201cPeople really frown upon that,\u201d said Wallner. Buying and quickly selling for a profit is discouraged by collectors and retailers alike for causing unbalanced supply and market volatility. (The practice can also result in banishment from official waitlists, and broader social shame in horology circles.)", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/24/style/luxury-pre-owned-watches/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "style_nigerian-artist-dotun-popoola-scrap-metal-spc", "text": "Celebrating the beauty of Blackness and protesting \u201cenvironmental decadence\u201d for a cleaner, waste-free future: that\u2019s the vision of award-winning Nigerian metal sculptor and visual artist Dotun Popoola.  Popoola has carved a niche for himself by transforming scrap metal into colorful sculptures of animals and people, which tackle issues including waste management and the importance of recycling. \u201cMy art is rooted in the use of discarded materials like motorcycle tanks, brake pads, car struts, bolts, nuts, and electric generator parts, all of which symbolize the visible signs of infrastructural decay in Nigeria,\u201d Popoola told CNN. Popoola\u2019s most recent sculpture is a 12-foot-tall, 882-pound piece depicting the decorated head and neck of an African woman, inspired by his wife. Called \u201cIrinkemi Asake \u201d \u2014 which roughly translates to \u201cmetals have enhanced my life\u201d in the Yoruba language \u2014 it was recently displayed as a part of the Artmiabo International Art Festival in Lagos. Composed of over 4,000 tiny metal butterflies, each individually welded and cut by hand, the sculpture is made from discarded metal, galvanized pipes, automobile parts, stainless steel, and wrought iron, and is coated with an anti-rust finishing and UV protection. \u201cThe work showcases the beauty of Black women all over the world,\u201d Popoola said of the piece, which he began in 2022. \u201cAt first glance, you would see her graceful curves, raw beauty, and her innate power. But it also represents the pain that Black women have gone through. Each piece of fragmented scraps and butterflies tells a story of her struggles and triumphs, of hardships endured, and barriers overcome. \u201cEverything you see in the sculpture, it\u2019s about bringing out the beauty of Blackness. Women create our life, they give us life and they make life meaningful to us.\u201d In less than 24 hours of unveiling the sculpture on Instagram earlier this year, Popoola had received over 50,000 followers from across the globe. \u201cI even received a beautiful message from Naomi Campbell,\u201d he said. \u201cThe amount of support shown by women all over the world made me shed tears of joy in my studio. I knew I\u2019d got it right.\u201d On the day of posting the reveal, Popoola received a message from Tera DuVernay, the deputy director of Legacy Museum in Montgomery, Alabama, and sister of American filmmaker Ava DuVernay. The museum tells the story of slavery in America and its legacy. \u201cTera told me how much she loved the sculpture and wanted to know how she could get it to her museum in Alabama,\u201d said Popoola. \u201cI\u2019ve had work displayed in Dubai, Qatar, India, all over the world \u2014 but none of them are in museums. I told myself it wasn\u2019t about making money, it\u2019s about the fact that the sculpture is going to the best place possible.\u201d The sculpture is being shipped to the museum in time for its Juneteenth concert, featuring jazz musician Wynton Marsalis, and others, where it will be unveiled in the 17-acre Freedom Monument Sculpture Park as a celebration of Black courage and resilience. Bryan Stevenson, founder and executive director at the Equal Justice Initiative, which set up the Legacy Museum said in an email: \u201cWe are thrilled to have Dotun Popoola\u2019s extraordinary sculpture, Irinkemi Asake, at Freedom Monument Sculpture Park. \u201cThe park explores the pain, trauma and suffering of millions of Black people who were enslaved in the Americas but it also illuminates the resilience, fortitude and capacity to love this community nurtured. \u201cMr. Popoola\u2019s work is well situated at our site because it brilliantly represents strength, beauty and resourcefulness which are precisely the attributes we want to celebrate among those who survived enslavement.\u201d \u201cEnvironmentalist, activist and artist\u201d It\u2019s a crowning achievement for Popoola, whose artistic flair emerged at a young age \u2014 although even then his output was unconventional. \u201cMy childhood creative explorations always consisted of me getting into trouble,\u201d he said. \u201cMy dad had a beautiful leather chair in our family home. I remember using a sharp razor blade to carve patterns into the material when I was nine.\u201d To cultivate his son\u2019s passion, Popoola\u2019s father enrolled him into an art class where he was taught to paint and sculpt, and he later attended Obafemi Awolowo University in Nigeria to study sculpting for his master\u2019s degree, which he completed in 2014. In 2015, he found a mentor in the US state of South Dakota, where he spent the summer learning how to weld metals. Upon his return to Lagos, Popoola began experimenting with using scrap metal. \u201cIt became my visual language,\u201d Popoola said. \u201cFor me, I feel as though I\u2019m doing the job as an environmentalist, activist and artist all in one. Art should be a catalyst for change, a tool for examining our sociocultural landscape, a means of reengineering, and a form of protest against environmental degradation.\u201d To spread his mission, Popoola has set up his own Scrap Art Museum focusing on nurturing young talent across Africa. The museum \u2014 which is based in Osun State, Southwest Nigeria and decorated with 3D art from recycled materials \u2014 trains young creatives and inspires them to contribute to the local art community. He also employs local people to collect metal for the museum and his own work, which he says gives them the opportunity of a steady income. For Popoola, success is measuring just how far he\u2019s progressed as an artist. \u201cI want to tell my story. I want to tell my truth with my work,\u201d he said. \u201cMost importantly, I want to tell young artists to keep the hope alive. If you keep doing what you do, one day you\u2019ll be in the spotlight and the world will be watching.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/nigerian-artist-dotun-popoola-scrap-metal-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_03_27_style_titanic-door-prop-auction-planet-hollywood", "text": "It\u2019s one of the most iconic, and hotly-debated, props in cinematic history: The floating wood panel that spared Kate Winslet\u2019s \u201cTitanic\u201d character Rose DeWitt Bukater from icy North Atlantic waters after the titular ocean liner\u2019s sinking \u2014 but not Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s Jack Dawson. And it\u2019s now been sold at auction for more than $700,000. \u201cOften mistakenly referred to as a door, the ornate structure was in reality part of the door frame just above the first-class lounge entrance,\u201d Heritage Auctions wrote in the auction notes. The prop\u2019s pivotal role in the \u201cbig scene, big goodbye\u201d moment, as the auction house had described it, features Rose floating on the floral-carved panel as Jack, having tried and failed to also rest atop, has succumbed to the cold. As a rescue boat arrives, Rose is forced to pry her hand from his frozen grip \u2014 while uttering the famous line \u201cI\u2019ll never let go, I promise,\u201d through chattering teeth \u2014 as she swims to her rescuers. The ornate balsa wood panel had previously been displayed at a Planet Hollywood in Orlando, Florida before being stored in their archives for some two decades, the auction house told CNN. It was sold alongside a roster of other props at the \u201cTreasures From Planet Hollywood\u201d auction, which included memorabilia items once displayed at Planet Hollywood locations worldwide and from its archives. These included pieces such as the whip from\u00a0\u201cIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\u201d and the ax from \u201cThe Shining.\u201d Across almost 1,600 lots in total, the five-day-long auction brought in $15.7 million, according\u00a0to a press release. But the \u201cTitanic\u201d flotsam took the prize for the highest-priced piece, far exceeding its starting price of $40,000 and selling for a grand total of $718,750 following a high-energy bidding war. Several other \u201cTitanic\u201d props were also put up for sale, including the pastel chiffon evening gown Rose wears in the movie on the night of the sinking and the ship\u2019s helm wheel, which sold for $118,750 and $200,000 respectively. A 2012 episode of the Discovery show \u201cMythBusters\u201d infamously found that two people could have survived long enough on the panel \u2014 which measures approximately eight feet (2.4 meters) long and just over three feet (1 meter) wide \u2014 if they added a life jacket for extra buoyancy. Remarking on the results, however, \u201cTitanic\u201d director James Cameron told the show\u2019s hosts, Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage, that Jack needed to die regardless. And in 2022, Cameron, alongside a hypothermia expert, tried to put an end to the debate once and for all with a\u00a0simulated test\u00a0to see if two people of the same body mass as Winslet and DiCaprio could have really stayed afloat on a piece of wood of the same size. Their final answer was no, it was not possible. There was no additional testing of these theories on the prop itself prior to its sale, as the auction house chooses to \u201chandle all items with great care when in transit and in storage,\u201d Heritage Auctions told CNN. But its new owner, who is choosing to remain anonymous, could well be planning a pool day, having been drawn in by the allure of the over two-decade-long mystery. \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is this massive interest in the films of the 1980s and 1990s,\u201d said Joe Maddalena, executive vice president of Heritage Auctions, in a statement. \u201cThere has been a generational shift to where these massive franchises of the 1980s and 1990s \u2014 the \u2018Home Alone\u2019s, the \u2018Indiana Jones\u2019 films, the \u2018Die Hard\u2019s \u2014 are now collectors\u2019 favorites\u2026 Collectors are finally rewarding these artifacts as what they are: cultural artifacts akin to the fine art of old.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/style/titanic-door-prop-auction-planet-hollywood/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}

The brainchild of Lithuanian artist Benediktas Gylys, \u201cthe Portal\u201d was unveiled on Wednesday and allows people on either side of the Atlantic to interact with each other via a video link. New Yorkers can head to Flatiron South Public Plaza at Broadway, Fifth Avenue, and 23rd Street, next to the Flatiron Building, to see people on Dublin\u2019s O\u2019Connell Street on the 24/7 visual livestream, according to a Wednesday press release. The idea was \u201cconceived as a testament to the power of art to transcend physical barriers,\u201d reads the press release from Gylys and officials from New York City and Dublin. It will remain in place through fall this year, according to the release, with a number of cultural performances scheduled to take place in front of the installations in both cities. \u201cPortals are an invitation to meet people above borders and differences and to experience our world as it really is \u2014 united and one,\u201d said\u00a0Gylys in the statement. \u201cThe livestream provides a window between distant locations, allowing people to meet outside of their social circles and cultures, transcend geographical boundaries, and embrace the beauty of global interconnectedness.\u201d The lord mayor of Dublin, Daith\u00ed de R\u00f3iste, said he is aiming to make the Irish capital more inclusive. \u201cThe Portals project embodies this, bringing together technology, engineering and art to bring communities from across the world closer together and to allow people to meet and connect outside of their social circles and cultures,\u201d he said. The installations are the latest in a series of portals built by Gylys, with the first pair opening in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius and the Polish city of Lublin in 2021. The Dublin portal will also connect with other installations in Lithuania and Poland from July onwards, said de R\u00f3iste in the statement. This is not the first time that an artist has brought New Yorkers closer to people across the Atlantic.

{"id": "2024_05_02_style_met-gala-garden-of-time-jg-ballard", "text": "Once a year on the first Monday of May, the carpeted steps of New York\u2019s Metropolitan Museum of Art (\u201cthe Met\u201d) become home to the most scrutinized costume party of the year. The dress code to end all dress codes, over the years the Met Gala theme has explored lofty subjects such as East to West international relations (\u201cChina: Through the Looking Glass,\u201d 2015), the visual history of catholicism (\u201cHeavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination,\u201d 2018) or even the value of art in the age of mechanical reproduction (\u201cManus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology,\u201d 2016). This year, Andrew Bolton, lead curator of the Met\u2019s fashion museum, The Costume Institute, has instructed celebrity guests to unpick the words of one of the most famous science fiction writers: JG Ballard. In February, the Met revealed Ballard\u2019s 1962 short story \u201cThe Garden of Time\u201d as the forthcoming red carpet theme. It will accompany the main exhibition, titled \u201cSleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\u201d featuring pieces from the Costume Institute archive that span four centuries. Many of the garments are so delicate, they can no longer be touched \u2014 let alone worn \u2014 without proper conservation equipment. Bolton describes it as \u201can ode to nature and the emotional poetics of fashion.\u201d In the \u201cGarden of Time,\u201d Count Axel and his wife live in a grand Palladian villa with a sprawling walled estate. A crystalline meadow of glass-like \u201ctime flowers\u201d spring out across the plot, while over the horizon, far in the distance a whip-yielding angry mob inch closer and closer to the Count\u2019s villa. Everyday Axel picks the head of a time flower, winding back the hours and reversing the mob\u2019s advancement over the hill until all the blooms are finished \u2014 an inevitability that looms large over the story\u2019s few pages. Finally, the crowd storms the wall, only to find a dilapidated villa and two stone statues in the image of the Count and Countess. Perhaps his most ambiguous story, the story\u2019s themes of decay, ruin, beauty and fragility are in direct conversation with the theme of \u201cSleeping Beauties.\u201d There is little glitz and glamor in Ballard\u2019s world \u2014 or if there is, it doesn\u2019t last for long. Since the 1950s, the late British author \u2014 who died in 2009 \u2014 has built an oeuvre centered almost exclusively on dystopian catastrophe, unbridled violence and the dissolution of the bourgeois psyche. Whether the scene is a luxury high-rise apartment complex or an affluent gated community in the south of France, Ballard\u2019s thesis remains the same: The glittering sheen of upper-middle class life is nothing but a thin veneer, seconds away from cracking. Even if you don\u2019t recognize his name, you are likely to have come across Ballard\u2019s unnerving musings on human psychology. For example, if you\u2019ve watched Steven Spielberg\u2019s 1987 film \u201cEmpire of the Sun,\u201d based on Ballard\u2019s 1984 novel fictionalizing his own experience as a child in a Chinese internment camp during World War II. Or David Cronenberg\u2019s 1996 adaptation of the writer\u2019s 1974 novel \u201cCrash\u201d \u2014 following a group of people sexually aroused by auto collisions \u2014 which was met with boos and early exits when it debuted at Cannes Film Festival. But it\u2019s not just film that has been directly inspired by Ballard. His worldview has infiltrated art, music, architecture and fashion, perhaps more consistently than any other 20th-century author. Fashion designers in particular have long been compelled by the Ballardian vision. In 2021, American designer Thom Browne\u2019s Spring-Summer catwalk at New York Fashion Week also imagined life behind Count Axel\u2019s garden wall. Browne conjures the story\u2019s final image of the stone aristocrats through silk-screened T-shirt dresses printed with Greek and Roman statuary, as well as wide brushstrokes of clay that cracked across the model\u2019s face. Israeli designer Alon Livn\u00e9 created a collection in 2013 prompted by the 1966 novel \u201cThe Crystal World;\u201d while in 1998, London-based designer Andrew Groves launched a Spring-Summer collection based on the 1997 story of a bored, moneyed and murderous enclave in Estrella de Mar called \u201cCocaine Nights.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s something about Ballard that takes the normal or the every day and makes it horrific and subversive,\u201d Groves, who first borrowed the book off of a friend more than 27 years ago, told CNN over Zoom. \u201cHe was really good at identifying the dystopian elements of the 20th century. And designers in the \u201890s like myself, McQueen, we were using fashion as a lens to think about its role in society and what it means.\u201d But none of Ballard\u2019s stories have been so habitually reimagined on the runway as \u201cCrash.\u201d The novel\u2019s (and later the film\u2019s) thorny images of crunched metalwork, black eyes and fishnets have become a key reference point for designers, from fledgling college graduates to brands on the fashion week circuit. Designer and former Moschino creative director Jeremy Scott crafted his first ever catwalk at Paris Fashion Week in 1997 on these visual cues, going as far to send French TV journalist Marie-Christiane Marek an actual car door as part of the invite. \u201cI remember being so completely stunned at the scenes where they were getting excited over these car accidents, and the cars and smoke and the mangled bodies and car parts,\u201d Scott said over video call. The collection, titled \u201cBody Modification,\u201d featured hospital gowns tucked and pleated like couture frocks, and nude-colored plexiglass inserts with stiletto heels bandaged to models\u2019 feet. \u201cThe hospital gowns were made of paper,\u201d said Scott. \u201cThe whole point was its ephemerality. And now with the Met Gala theme, the beautiful flower that dies as soon as it\u2019s plucked, it connects back to fashion being ephemeral. It\u2019s a fleeting moment, even if we hold onto it for a lifetime.\u201d The influence of \u201cCrash\u201d in particular has spread like an oil spill across the arts. In 1986, British architect Nigel Coates built Caff\u00e8 Bongo in Tokyo \u2014 a restaurant whose frontage features a lifesize aircraft wing crashed into a Roman column. \u201cI\u2019m more interested in the culture of architecture and how that can be contributed to in a variety of ways, rather than the proof of architecture through building,\u201d said Coates in a 2011 lecture on Ballardian architecture. \u201cI find a cohesive connection with the story \u201cCrash,\u201d and the way in which the perversity of sexual pleasure combined with danger and pain has a certain combination which can find its way in architecture.\u201d Criticism of Caff\u00e8 Bongo briefly brandished Coates as a dangerous architect, after many believed it was unbuildable. \u201cI proved them wrong,\u201d he said. From Madonna and Charli XCX to Radiohead and Joy Division, musicians across genres have dedicated records, album artwork and track titles to Ballard. Madonna\u2019s 1998 song \u201cDrowned World/ Substitute for Love\u201d takes its name from the 1962 novel, while Joy Division frontman Ian Curtis pinched the short story title \u201cAtrocity Exhibition\u201d before reportedly ever having read Ballard. The album artwork for \u201cCrash\u201d (2022) by Charli XCX mingles the gore of a car wreck with sexual overtones, as she straddles a totaled car bonnet in a black bikini \u2014 staring into a smashed windscreen with a trickle of blood seeping from her temple. The Manic Street Preachers sampled the infamous Ballard quote \u201cI wanted to rub the human face in its own vomit, and force it to look in the mirror,\u201d in their 1994 track \u201cMausoleum.\u201d Even Radiohead\u2019s resident artist Stanley Donwood, who has created every album cover for the band since 1994, was commissioned by Fourth Estate Books in 2015 to redesign the look of Ballard\u2019s 21 novels. But what will we see out on the Met steps? While the style press predicts a torrent of peony-printed gowns, a quick scan of Ballard\u2019s words will hopefully steer celebrities in a darker direction. \u201cThere\u2019s something I think within fashion about things being slightly off,\u201d said Groves.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s what makes (clothes) interesting.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/met-gala-garden-of-time-jg-ballard/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_04_09_style_otzi-iceman-tattoos-study-scn", "text": "Found high in the Tyrolean Alps in 1991, \u00d6tzi the Iceman had dark skin and eyes and was likely bald. His remarkably well-preserved remains, frozen beneath ice for about 5,300 years, revealed 61 tattoos inked all over his body. How and why \u00d6tzi, perhaps the world\u2019s most studied corpse, got the body art has long been a source of fascination. Initial analysis suggested the tattoos were incised with a blade and then impregnated with black pigment. Now, the latest research strongly suggests a single-point puncture tool, tipped with carbon pigment, could have been behind the markings. \u201cOne of the threads we identified is that a lot of the work that was done on his tattoos initially was done by scholars who were excellent scholars but they were not themselves tattooed and didn\u2019t have personal experience with the tattooing process,\u201d said Aaron Deter-Wolf, lead author of the new study. \u201cOver the years, I\u2019ve had numerous conversations with professional tattooists and when you get talking about it and looking at the pictures, they say, oh, no, oh, no, those absolutely are not cut into the skin \u2026 but that hadn\u2019t been shown in a scientifically sound setting,\u201d explained Deter-Wolf, a prehistoric archaeologist at the Tennessee Division of Archaeology who has a tattoo similar to one of \u00d6tzi\u2019s on his wrist. The study, published in the European Journal of Archaeology on March 13, reviewed existing literature on \u00d6tzi\u2019s tattoos and drew on present-day experiments replicating ancient tattooing techniques. \u201cMost of them were on the lower legs and ankles. One on the left wrist and there\u2019s a set of them on the lower back around the cervical spine,\u201d Deter-Wolf said. \u201cThey\u2019re lines that are in some cases crossed but more often parallel to one another. They range from two (lines) to five or six of them.\u201d Scientists have analyzed nearly every part of \u00d6tzi and his belongings, painting an intimate picture of life in the late fourth millennium BC. And now, the new study provides a better understanding of how the oldest known tattoos in human history were created, though questions still remain about the meaning behind the body art. A scientific celebrity Originally, researchers believed \u00d6tzi froze to death, but a 2001 X-ray revealed an arrowhead in his shoulder, which would have been fatal. The iceman also had a head injury, possibly sustained at the same time, and his right hand shows a defensive wound. The mystery over \u00d6tzi\u2019s violent death, who he was and how he ended up on a mountain pass has sparked interest far beyond the field of archaeology. Each year, thousands visit his mummified remains, which are on display at the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Bolzano, Italy. The existing body of science on \u00d6tzi is astonishingly comprehensive. Stomach contents yielded information on his last meal and where he came from, study of his DNA has revealed his ancestry and appearance, his weapons showed he was right-handed, and his clothes gave a rare look at what ancient people actually wore. In a February 2016 study, Deter-Wolf compiled a database of dozens of examples of ancient tattoos, including body art found on Egyptian, Chinese and Incan mummified remains, that pinpointed \u00d6tzi\u2019s body art as the oldest known examples of tattooing. The feat was possible thanks to nondestructive digital imaging technology and collaborations between archaeologists and tattoo artists. \u201cOnce we all put our heads together, we come up with a lot better and more informed hypothesis about how these things work,\u201d he said. The 2016 study suggests that tattoos are a long-standing and widespread cultural practice, with different means of permanently inserting pigments beneath the skin. The techniques include hand poking or tapping with the use of a single-point tool that may or may not have a handle; incision; and subdermal tattooing, or skin stitching, using a needle to thread an ink-soaked filament or sinew. Deter-Wolf and his colleagues also experimented with different traditional techniques in a September 2022 study. Using eight tools fashioned from animal bone, obsidian, copper and boar tusk, along with a modern steel needle, New Zealand-based traditional tattoo artist and study coauthor Danny Riday inked tattoos on his leg. The tattoos on \u00d6tzi \u2019s body have rounded edges consistent with a hand-poked tattoo, most likely made with a bone or copper, Deter-Wolf said. In contrast, incision tattooing creates edges that are pointed because of the way the lines are cut into the skin. \u201cThere\u2019s a variation within the line because you\u2019re putting in all of these individual punctures so closely to each other and how much they overlap results in kind of a stippling effect when you look at it under high enough magnification.\u201d A bone awl \u00d6tzi carried in his tool kit was a potential candidate but has yet to be studied in detail to confirm whether microscopic wear marks are consistent with a tattooing function. However, Deter-Wolf thinks it\u2019s unlikely. \u201cIt\u2019s strongly evocative in (the) context (of a) woodsman\u2019s kit rather than a tattooing kit.\u201d The new knowledge about how \u00d6tzi\u2019s tattoos were likely made was \u201cparticularly exciting\u201d because the puncture method used showed a continuity with present-day tattoo techniques, said Dr. Matt Lodder, a senior lecturer of art history and theory, and director of American studies at the University of Essex in the UK. \u201cThe real magic of \u00d6tzi\u2019s story to modern eyes is how familiar it feels \u2014 anyone who has been tattooed, particularly if you\u2019ve been tattooed with hand tools, can relate to the sensations he would have felt whilst being tattooed, the process he went through to heal his tattoos,\u201d said Lodder, who is also the author of \u201cPainted People: Humanity in 21 Tattoos.\u201d He was not involved in the study. \u201cThat we can empathise so strongly with a man who lived five millennia ago is a remarkably powerful link to our shared human past.\u201d Unresolved mystery of \u00d6tzi\u2019s tattoos Why did \u00d6tzi have so many tattoos? One explanation put forth in the scientific literature is that they were an ancient healing technique, a bit similar to an early form of acupuncture, rather than body art. Many of the tattoos could have been an ancient way to treat joint pain in his lower back, knees, hip and wrists. \u201cWe don\u2019t disagree with the idea that they could have been therapeutic. I think all of it\u2019s on the table. Just because something has given us a therapeutic treatment doesn\u2019t mean that it doesn\u2019t have culturally symbolic value,\u201d Deter-Wolf said. Marco Samadelli, senior researcher at the Institute for Mummy Studies at Eurac Research, a private research institute in Bolzano, said the work was of a \u201chigh scientific standard.\u201d \u201cThe authors do not claim with absolute certainty the puncture tattoo technique with a single-pointed instrument, but give extensive and plausible explanations,\u201d he said via email. Samadelli urged the team to continue their study of \u00d6tzi\u2019s tattoos and how they were made. \u201cTo date, there are no plans to examine the bone awl and horn tooth found with the Iceman to see if they were used as hand-tipped tools, but I hope Aaron Deter-Wolf will maintain his interest and apply to the scientific committee of the \u00d6tzi Museum to analyze and study them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/09/style/otzi-iceman-tattoos-study-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_04_04_style_taipei-101-earthquake-design-intl-hnk", "text": "The deadly 7.4 magnitude earthquake that hit Taiwan on Wednesday and left at least 9 people dead, also damaged 770 buildings, according to the latest estimates from the island\u2019s National Fire Agency (NFA). In the capital Taipei, just 80 miles away from the epicenter, buildings also shook violently during what was Taiwan\u2019s strongest earthquake in 25 years. But in a triumph of modern engineering, the soaring Taipei 101, once the world\u2019s tallest skyscraper, emerged from the island\u2019s latest seismic event undamaged. Footage from the quake appears to show the 1,667-foot-tall tower slightly swaying, its structural flexibility helping to counter the powerful motion of the quake. This movement perfectly demonstrated how the skyscraper\u2019s single most important defense against earthquakes is the very material it is constructed from: reinforced concrete. Combining concrete\u2019s compressive strength with steel\u2019s tensile strength, the material makes the building flexible enough to sway, yet rigid enough to resist high winds and the typhoons that frequently hit Taiwan. (The principle that buildings can endure seismic forces by moving with them, rather than against them, has underpinned traditional architecture in earthquake-prone East Asian countries for centuries, from Japanese pagodas to Chinese palaces.) High within the tower,\u00a0however, another technological innovation helps protect the 101-story skyscraper \u2014 a huge orb-like device known as a tuned mass damper. Giant counterweight Suspended from 92 thick cables between the 87th and 92nd floors, the golden steel sphere can move about 5 feet in any direction. As a result, it acts like a pendulum that counteracts (or \u201cdampens\u201d) swaying motions. \u201cIt\u2019s essentially a very large counterweight,\u201d explained Stefan Al, author of \u201cSupertall: How the World\u2019s Tallest Buildings Are Reshaping Our Cities and Our Lives,\u201d in a phone interview. \u201cIn the case of Taipei 101, it\u2019s 660 tons. That seems really heavy, but if you compare it to the overall weight of the building, it\u2019s just a fraction. \u201cWhen a building starts to shake, (the tuned mass damper) will move in the opposite direction. In the case of Taipei 101, it\u2019s suspended\u2026 so it will lag behind as the tower sways and will absorb the kinetic energy by moving in the opposite direction,\u201d Al said, explaining that hydraulic cylinders between the ball and the building convert this energy into heat, which is then dispersed. Tuned mass dampers are used in skyscrapers around the world, including the \u201csuper-skinny\u201d Steinway Tower in New York and Dubai\u2019s sail-shaped Burj al-Arab, which has 11 of them. The device crucially protects against the violent motion caused by \u201charmonic vibration,\u201d which can cause structural failure during an earthquake, Al said. \u201c(That\u2019s) when buildings start to vibrate at their own resonance,\u201d he said, comparing the phenomenon to a tuning fork. \u201cThis can lead to a collapse, (as the building) will start shaking faster and faster and faster.\u201d Tuned mass dampers, which are also known as harmonic absorbers, are \u201ctuned\u201d to resonate at the same frequency as the building \u2014 but with wavelengths starting earlier or later, helping to dissipate the potentially catastrophic energy. The stability they provide can also reduce the uncomfortable \u2014 or even nauseating \u2014 effect swaying can have on a building\u2019s occupants in high winds. Structural support Designed by Taiwanese firm C.Y. Lee & Partners, Taipei 101 was the world\u2019s tallest building from 2004 until 2007, when it was surpassed by the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. An observation deck overlooking its groundbreaking tuned mass damper is now a popular visitor attraction, especially when it moves during strong winds. The giant sphere is not, however, the only design feature helping stabilize the tower, which stands close to a major fault line. For one, the skyscraper sits on exceptionally deep foundations \u2014 namely 380 reinforced concrete and steel piles drilled down into the bedrock below. Above them, the building\u2019s core is connected to a series of \u201cmega-columns,\u201d located around its perimeter, via enormous steel outrigger trusses. The high-rise complies with strict anti-seismic building codes that are as stringent as one might expect on an island located along the \u201cPacific Ring of Fire,\u201d which runs around the edge of the Pacific Ocean and causes massive seismic and volcanic activity from Indonesia to Chile. But while the design also underwent extensive digital modeling and \u201cshake table\u201d testing (in which scale models are tested on a device that replicates the movement of an earthquake), how a building like Taipei 101 would react to a stronger or closer seismic event remains, to an extent, theoretical. \u201cEven though we have computer simulations, there\u2019s still something about the physical that that we cannot really get from digital simulations,\u201d said Al, adding: \u201cDespite our technological advances, we are still testing (designs) in wind tunnels and shaker tables.\u201d This article has been updated to reflect the latest estimates on the number of buildings damaged.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/04/style/taipei-101-earthquake-design-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}

{"id": "2024_05_13_style_platon-photographer-portraits", "text": "Vladimir Putin, Muammar Gaddafi, Mark Zuckerberg. Presidents and Hollywood stars; political dissidents, abuse survivors and immigrants. One thing unites them all: a slightly scuffed, white wooden box. \u201cMore world leaders have sat on that box than any chair in history,\u201d the photographer Platon, owner of that very box, told CNN in an interview conducted over Zoom. For some world leaders, the scarcity of his set \u2014 sitting on the box in front of a plain black or white sheet of paper \u2014 can be intimidating, stripping them of their usual grandeur. For others it\u2019s liberating, allowing the human to shine through the professional storyteller. For the subjects of Platon\u2019s new book \u201cThe Defenders,\u201d the box became an opportunity. \u201cThere\u2019s a statement that\u2019s quite common in the human rights community,\u201d Platon said. \u201c\u2018Giving a voice to the voiceless\u2019. I have learned through my experiences that it\u2019s not right to say that. They have beautiful, powerful, strong voices; the issue is that those voices have been ignored.\u201d Through his work, he explained his mission is to help amplify people\u2019s stories, tuning into their humanity as though they were \u201can old-fashioned radio\u201d. Unseating power Born in Greece in 1968, Platon Antoniou moved to the UK aged eight and completed his studies in photography at the Royal College of Art, before leaving London for a career in New York. There, he worked on George magazine with John Kennedy Jr. and as a staff photographer at the New Yorker magazine. \u201cThe Defenders\u201d takes a different tack to Platon\u2019s earlier work. As a young photographer, he confessed he was dazzled by the world of politicians and celebrities he was working with, walking the corridors of the Kremlin and Downing Street and \u201chaving a chat about life\u201d in George Clooney\u2019s garden. Turning his lens to the powerless, by contrast, has upturned his ideas of power altogether. \u201cHaving photographed all these world leaders, often the people I meet in the trenches of the human rights movement are proper leaders,\u201d he said. \u201cThey transform their adversity into compassion for others. And that\u2019s something I very rarely see on that level in the political sphere. So I called them \u2014 I call the book \u2014 \u201cThe Defenders,\u201d because it\u2019s a superhero title. These are ordinary people who do extraordinary things, and I do think of them as superheroes. Changing the narrative is very important for me.\u201d Among \u201cThe Defenders\u201d are Burmese and Egyptian dissidents, the imprisoned Russian punk band Pussy Riot, and survivors of sexual violence at Dr. Denis Mukwege\u2019s Panzi Hospital in Congo. One of the girls that Platon photographed there was Esther Faraja. She appeared in an episode of Netflix\u2019s \u201cAbstract: The Art of Design,\u201d profiling Platon, although he said the details of the trauma she suffered were \u201ctoo harsh to put in the film.\u201d \u201cAs I was taking the picture, she wasn\u2019t crying,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI\u2019m a privileged, middle-aged white man, and I\u2019m a mess. I said to her, \u2018how is it that I\u2019m crying, and you\u2019re not crying? And yet, you\u2019re the one that has suffered?\u2019 And she said: \u2018the reason I don\u2019t cry in your picture is because I don\u2019t want to make you feel sad. I don\u2019t want anyone to feel sad when they look at a picture of me. My mommy and daddy brought me into this world to bring joy to the world. And I will keep my promise\u2019.\u201d Platon is as awestruck now as he was standing in front of her. \u201cNow that is a leader,\u201d he said. \u201cI made a promise to her that I will deliver her message of compassion and strength, combined, to as many people as I can.\u201d \u201cThe Defenders\u201d is an attempt to tell dozens of stories like hers, each captured in one 500th of a second. \u201cTime is a very interesting concept; it doesn\u2019t really ever exist,\u201d Platon mused. \u201cYou try to freeze a moment that helps us understand the past and will still be relevant in the future. And yet, it was a moment in the present. And it was such a tiny fragment of a moment that if you blinked, you wouldn\u2019t even have seen it.\u201d Two political giants offer obvious examples of time\u2019s bizarre effect. Vladimir Putin, photographed by Platon for Time\u2019s Person of the Year in 2007, initially liked the image that Platon produced. He appears powerful. In the time since its publication, however, the same image has been taken, edited, and circulated by political dissidents to mock Putin and belittle his power. \u201cI heard in the last two years that anyone who\u2019s caught circulating my picture in connection with human rights issues will go to jail,\u201d Platon said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s the same picture. And Putin likes it.\u201d Bill Clinton, on a December 2000 cover of Esquire courtesy of Platon, has also been changed with age. \u201cAt the time, that picture represented insane levels of charisma,\u201d Platon recalled. \u201cHe was great with people \u2014 everyone says there\u2019s no one more charismatic than Bill Clinton. We look at it through a different lens now, but it\u2019s the same picture. When I get it right, that same picture works for everybody.\u201d It doesn\u2019t work for Hillary Clinton, though. \u201cHillary refuses to sit for me,\u201d Platon noted. \u201cShe\u2019s one of the only politicians who\u2019s ever said no. And that\u2019s interesting. The \u2018no\u2019 now is actually as interesting as the \u2018yes\u2019.\u201d Great responsibility Distilling broad, complicated, emotional human stories into one fleeting moment is a tribulation of all photography, including that of world leaders, but it was particularly difficult when it came to the sensitive topics broached in \u201cThe Defenders\u201d. \u201cMany of (the people photographed) risk their lives and their security telling me these stories,\u201d Platon said. \u201cI cannot be reckless. I cannot be \u2014 I must not be \u2014 a thrill-seeker.\u201d Exerting due diligence and handling sensitive subjects thoughtfully is something that Platon admits is a luxury of time; he is able to spend months on a project, producing the most considered and provoking images he can. Increasingly, however, a lot of the photography flooding social media is taken hastily, captured on phones and shared without so much as a pause for breath. In \u201cThe Defenders,\u201d Platon remembers the Burmese politician Aung San Suu Kyi coming out of house arrest and being bewildered by the sea of smartphones pointed at her. \u201cNow everyone\u2019s a photographer, and everyone\u2019s a filmmaker,\u201d Platon observed. \u201cIn many ways, that\u2019s fantastic. People are holding the powers that be accountable in a new way. The danger is that there\u2019s so much information that we\u2019re constantly distracted. It\u2019s very difficult to get that moment of reflection and pause, and to stand back and think for yourself. As you\u2019re even doing that, your phone is dinging and clicking and beeping \u2014 it\u2019s constant noise.\u201d In standing back, Platon was able to join the dots between the movements he was documenting; they weren\u2019t isolated struggles, he realized, but connected ones. \u201cObviously each geopolitical situation is inherently different, but they are all fighting for very basic human principles,\u201d he said. \u201cI photographed LGBTQ+ defenders in Burma and in Russia. That\u2019s two very, very different countries, with the same cause.\u201d In capturing and amplifying the stories of \u201cThe Defenders,\u201d Platon hopes to inspire and instruct other people, just as he was inspired and instructed. \u201cIt\u2019s really a handbook to the new generation to say: roll up your sleeves, get involved. Society needs a new generation of activists who will think differently. They will have a different path to navigate, but the principles remain timeless and the same. It\u2019s the principles that unite us all. The way we fight, the tools we fight with, the strategies \u2014 we have to change those, because times change. But the principles stay the same.\u201d \u201cThe Defenders\u201d, published by MW Editions, is available now.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/style/platon-photographer-portraits/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}

The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through\u00a0the building \u2013 known locally as B\u00f8rsen \u2013\u00a0from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen\u00a0police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a \u201ccomplicated process.\u201d Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already \u201cconducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.\u201d \u201cBut of course, there is still a lot to do, especially as we have not yet had the opportunity to examine\u00a0B\u00f8rsen itself,\u201d Belling added. The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. \u201cMy first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be the same but it\u2019s iconic to\u00a0Copenhagen\u00a0and Denmark,\u201d teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters. Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, told the news agency that a firefighter gave him the top of the spire on Wednesday morning after it was recovered following its fall. \u201cIt gives me hope because we have decided to rebuild the stock exchange because it\u2019s part of European history as a trading continent,\u201d he said. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. It has been at the heart of Danish business since then; while it no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, it serves as the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday a \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d was on fire, calling the building \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt added that 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/17/style/copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_03_19_style_big-biba-london-1960s-store-history", "text": "\u201cMy God, it\u2019s dull,\u201d said interior designer Steven Thomas of the British retail landscape in 2024. As the creative force behind the look of the wildly popular 1970s London fashion store Big Biba, Thomas knows a thing or two about engineering excitement. Big Biba \u2014 a daring, 20,000 square foot destination by fashion illustrator Barbara Hulanicki and her former marketing executive husband, Stephen Fitz-Simon \u2014 was conceived with a level of detail usually reserved for high-end concept stores.\u00a0Opened in September 1973,\u00a0it was the\u00a0fourth and final outpost of the-then iconic brand.\u00a0The\u00a0seven-floor Art Deco emporium on London\u2019s fashionable Kensington High Street featured\u00a0a soup stand inspired by Andy Warhol, a roof garden featuring real flamingos and penguins, and a much-lauded celebrity hotspot the \u201cRainbow Room\u201d. \u201cBecause the Rainbow Room looked the way it did, it didn\u2019t take long for the glitterati to latch on; it was very much a place to be seen dining,\u201d recalled Thomas in an interview with CNN. Originally designed by architect Marcel Hennequet in 1933 and named after its multi-colored ceiling (the dining room was otherwise all white tablecloths and fake plants), it \u201cbecame a venue of choice,\u201d he suggested. \u201cDavid Bowie, Mick Jagger, Bryan Ferry all dropped in.\u201d \u201cFitz employed the son of a friend who had an extraordinary knack of picking people up, like Ian Dury and the Blockheads,\u201d continued Thomas, recalling the unofficial booker. \u201cHe got the New York Dolls to play when they came over, another coup. They did a vandalizing tour of the first floor, shoplifting all the women\u2019s clothes.\u201d These stories and more are all explored in \u201cWelcome to Big Biba,\u201d Thomas\u2019s gold-fronted monograph of the venture republished this month by ACC Art Books to celebrate the brand\u2019s 60th anniversary. \u201cThis book is a testament to creative freedom,\u201d writes the now 87-year-old Hulanicki in the foreword, reflecting on her legacy. \u201cYou can do it all as long as you learn to wear a suit. Of course, your secret will be that the suit is lined in gold lam\u00e9.\u201d Making fashion democratic The Biba story began in May 1964 when Hulanicki and Fitz-Simon began running \u201cBiba\u2019s Postal Boutique,\u201d a mail-order store selling limited runs of stock. Singer Annie Lennox described the venture as having led \u201cthe way for those of us living in provincial places where we felt we were dying of drabness.\u201d Inspired by decadent styles from bygone times \u2014 albeit with drastically shortened hemlines \u2014 in earthy or muted colors such as olive, rust and \u201cbruised purple,\u201d Biba\u2019s wares certainly struck a chord with young female shoppers, and the brand rode the wave of what Thomas described as \u201cthe first burst of teenage energy and finance availability.\u201d \u201cBiba made fashion democratic,\u201d explained Martin Pel, author of \u201cThe Biba Years 1963-1975\u201d and curator of a new exhibition at London\u2019s Fashion & Textile Museum, in an email. \u201cThis expression is often overused of designers in the 1960s, particularly Mary Quant. Quant\u2019s clothes whilst youthful, were expensive. Biba was inexpensive, well designed, good quality, and up-to-the-minute.\u201d By September 1964, Hulanicki and Fitz-Simon had opened their first brick and mortar store in a former drugstore, twice moving the business into bigger premises throughout the 60s. In 1966 the brand\u2019s second shop on Kensington Church Street \u2014 where Vogue editor Anna Wintour famously did a stint as a Saturday girl \u2014 was described by Vanity Fair magazine as \u201cthe most exotic shop in London.\u201d and in the early 1970s, a boutique launched in New York\u2019s Bergdorf Goodman department store. \u201cAn act of bravery\u201d Interior designer Thomas had already designed Hulanicki and Fitz-Simon\u2019s home and the third Biba store in 1968 before being approached about the landmark seven-level store. \u201cFitz offered me two floors (of Big Biba) but I wanted it all,\u201d he recalled of his initial involvement. \u201cA moment of complete lunacy, considering Tim (Whitmore, his creative partner) and I were ex-painting students working out of my bedroom. It was an extraordinary act of bravery on their part, giving us the contract, it wouldn\u2019t happen today.\u201d Stocking Big Biba\u2019s seven floors was equal parts intimidating and invigorating said Thomas, explaining that he and Whitmore worked closely with Hulanicki throughout. \u201cBiba was always a reflection of Barbara\u2019s life,\u201d he noted, \u201cso because Barbara had a kid, of course we had a kid\u2019s floor,\u201d with d\u00e9cor inspired by Disney World, a carousel ride and miniature cottage kids caf\u00e9 with toadstool seating. On Saturdays, an actor would visit and read stories and a cr\u00e8che \u2014 a revolutionary concept in fashion retail now, let alone 50 years ago \u2014 allowed parents freedom to explore the other floors. A maternity section and a space for 11-13 year old\u2019s were similarly modern for the time, likewise the introduction of communal changing rooms \u2014 although true to the spirit of the times, many clients reportedly changed in the middle of the store itself. Elsewhere menswear took over the third floor, complete with a \u201cmistress\u201d section for purchasing more sensual items with discretion. Biba-branded household items were upstairs. While each floor took on its own theme (maternity for example was fitted with comedic outsized furniture, inspired by Ken Russell\u2019s 1971 musical comedy \u201cThe Boyfriend\u201d), much of the store was furnished in Biba\u2019s distinctive black and gold colorway, with mirrored fixtures, ostrich feathers and leopard print features. While Wintour\u2019s shopgirl life was short-lived, Big Biba\u2019s staff were a vital component of the experience remembered Thomas. \u201cThey loved working there, it was their club,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if a (customer) bought a Biba poster and stuck it on her wall, she felt part of the club. It was the theater of retail really.\u201d It was an unmitigated success. When the store opened its legendary roof gardens in 1974, they were ushered in by a party described in the British press as \u201clike walking into a film set of rather jolly moral depravity.\u201d Shoppers from all over the country, and even internationally, convened at the store to buy into the zeitgeist. According to Hulanicki, during its two-year run, Big Biba was the number two tourist attraction in the British capital after the Tower of London, with Buckingham Palace being number three. But Biba\u2019s success was short-lived. In 1969, the independent company sold a majority of its shares to another British fashion retailer Dorothy Perkins which, in August 1973 (a month before Big Biba opened), was then bought by a property development company called British Land. The high cost of keeping the store open and the faltering British economy of the mid-70s meant the new owners closed the store\u2019s third and fourth floors in March 1975, and the rest of the store followed that September against the backdrop of a nationwide property slump. Six decades on however, Biba\u2019s legacy outlasts its footprint on the high street. Its low-cost yet well-made clothing is still coveted today, with heirloom designs sometimes retailing for hundreds of dollars. As Pel noted, \u201ctoday Biba clothes stand as a lesson to both consumers and retailers that inexpensive fashion does not have to be disposable.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/style/big-biba-london-1960s-store-history/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}

That watch was the \u201cmost beautiful thing I\u2019d ever seen,\u201d Stallone said in a video released by Sotheby\u2019s, and sparked a decades-long love of watch collecting. And now, the Hollywood star is auctioning 11 watches from his personal collection at a Sotheby\u2019s sale in New York on June 5. Among the items is the rare Patek Philippe Grandmaster Chime, which is expected to fetch as much as $5 million, as well as watches he wore in some of his films. Only seven models of the Grandmaster Chime were ever made, given that it is the most complicated wristwatch ever manufactured by the famous luxury watchmakers. As such, Sotheby\u2019s dubbed it the \u201choly grail\u201d for watch collectors, appreciated for its extraordinarily intricate mechanisms that took 100,000 hours to develop, produce and assemble. It features 20 complications \u2013 functions that go beyond telling the time \u2013 such as five chiming mechanisms and a date repeater which audibly indicate both the date and time. \u201cThis is not easy to come by,\u201d Stallone said. \u201cI had to appeal to certain powers that be, write many letters to the board and eventually it was determined that I was going to be the owner of one of these magnificent pieces of art.\u201d Other memorabilia comes with the watch too, including a presentation box engraved with Stallone\u2019s name and an iPad and Airpods each complete with a Patek Phillipe case. Another Patek Philippe watch, this one from its Nautilus family, is expected to sell for up to $400,000. It features an olive-green dial, surrounded by 32 Wesselton baguette diamonds, in a stainless steel casing. Several other notable watchmakers are represented in the auction too, including models that Stallone wore while on camera. A Rolex watch released in 2016 to mark the 60th anniversary of a model that was the first to display both day and date separately could sell for $50,000. Meanwhile, a watch made by Audemars Piguet featuring a blue face inside a pink gold case is estimated to fetch up to $200,000. Also included in the auction are several Panerai watches, a brand that Stallone has long championed and worn on camera in the 1996 movie \u201cDaylight.\u201d A model exclusively made for him, with an engraving commemorating that on the back, is among the watches featured in this auction and is expected to sell for up to $60,000.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/07/style/sylvester-stallone-watch-collection-auction-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_style_youthforia-black-foundation-shade", "text": "When cosmetic company Youthforia launched\u00a0its \u201cDate Night Skin Tint\u201d serum foundation\u00a0line in 15 shades last year, some beauty influencers and reviewers were critical\u00a0of the lack of options for darker skin tones. Golloria\u00a0George, a Texas-based beauty influencer with over 1.5 million followers on TikTok,\u00a0shared\u00a0why\u00a0she felt\u00a0the brand had missed the mark\u00a0\u2014 and an opportunity \u2014\u00a0in a TikTok video last September\u00a0that racked up more than 2.4 million views. In her series, \u201cThe Darkest Shade,\u201d George reviews the darkest shade in a brand\u2019s lineup to see if it could match her complexion. The darkest Youthforia shade,\u00a0she claimed,\u00a0was lighter than what was advertised online and didn\u2019t match her skin tone. It\u2019s a criticism many brands have faced over the years, as the beauty industry \u2014 which critics have long accused of\u00a0elevating Eurocentric beauty standards\u00a0\u2014 tries to expand its product lines for melanated skin tones. Youthforia\u00a0is a \u201cclean and sustainable makeup company\u201d that markets\u00a0itself as \u201cmakeup you can sleep in,\u201d according to its website. The company\u2019s founder, Fiona Co Chan, appeared on an episode of the TV series\u00a0\u201cShark Tank\u201d that aired in 2023\u00a0and\u00a0received a $400,000 investment from\u00a0billionaire Mark Cuban. In March, the beauty brand\u00a0added 10 new shades\u00a0to its \u201cDate Night\u201d collection, many for darker complexions. George told CNN she was still unsure if one of\u00a0the new products would be a match, so she again tried the brand\u2019s darkest shade \u2014 600 Deep Neutral \u2014 and was stunned by the result. \u201cWhich side of my face is the black face paint or the\u00a0Youthforia\u00a0foundation?\u201d\u00a0she asked in\u00a0a Tiktok\u00a0video posted April 30. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell. You know why? Tar in a bottle.\u201d That video now has over 24 million views. Youthforia did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Last year, Chan defended her brand in a post that has since been deleted.\u00a0Earlier this year,\u00a0days before the new products launched, Youthforia\u00a0posted a video\u00a0on TikTok where Chan says the brand had trouble finding models to match the darkest shades they offer. \u201cSo a month ago we held a casting call to just look for real people, real skin. We found matches for most of our shades except for our dark shades,\u201d she says in the video. In the days that followed, the brand posted\u00a0a series of view of videos showing Chan searching for models and ultimately testing the foundation on two young men who \u201cgraciously agreed to be our models\u201d in a mall. She applies the 600 foundation \u2014 the same one George used \u2014 to half of one model\u2019s face and remarks on how it appears to be a match. \u201cHis undertone was actually perfect,\u201d she says. Last week, Youthforia replied to a comment about the brand\u2019s darkest shade by resharing the video from March. While George acknowledges the shade may work for some customers, she\u00a0also\u00a0posted a separate video where she reviews the brand\u2019s second darkest shade, 590, which she notes \u201cleans very red on me.\u201d George told CNN she found the transition between the two darkest products offered by Youthforia to be \u201cshocking.\u201d \u201cIt was like we really just missed a whole range of undertones and depth and it\u2019s disrespectful,\u201d she said. And she\u00a0wasn\u2019t the only one remarking on the brand\u2019s attempt to provide products for darker skin tones, with other content creators calling out the brand and\u00a0even trying to mix shades together\u00a0to create lighter options. George told CNN\u00a0 the saga reminded her of not being\u00a0able to\u00a0find shades of makeup that matched her complexion when she was younger. \u201cIt was a big deal. It was really disheartening,\u201d she said. \u201cI really felt like there was something wrong with me, you know, and no one deserves to feel like that.\u201d Karen Chambers, chair of the diversity, equity & inclusion taskforce at Cosmetic Executive Women, said\u00a0Youthforia is not the only brand to face this sort of criticism from customers. The success of Rhianna\u2019s FENTY launch in 2017 saw many makeup brands working to expand their product offerings. But in 2020, influencers called for a boycott of Hourglass Cosmetics after the company released a\u00a0fan-favorite foundation\u00a0with a limited shade range. In 2018, Tarte\u2019s Shape Tape line also faced similar criticism, causing beauty influencer NikkieTutorials to\u00a0remove a video\u00a0about the product and call their shade range \u201can absolute mess.\u201d Chambers, who has\u00a0worked with brands such as\u00a0IMAN Cosmetics, Dark & Lovely and Posner\u00a0throughout her 28-year career, said\u00a0in the past five or so years brands have recognized the need for more conversations around diversity and inclusivity. \u201cWhether it\u2019s domestically or globally, demographics are changing and if a brand is not inclusive in what they offer, then they are just missing a huge opportunity as far as just accurately being there for their consumer base,\u201d\u00a0she said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve seen brands that have gotten (an) \u2018A\u2019 in their efforts to diversify and we\u2019ve seen brands that have gotten an \u2018F\u2019\u00a0and everywhere in between.\u201d In addition to research,\u00a0Chambers said, the\u00a0businesses\u00a0should incorporate diversity as a whole. \u201cCertainly as in this instance, in those laboratories, you\u2019ve got to have someone who understands that creating darker shades for brown skin is not as easy as adding black to an existing one that\u2019s created for light skin.\u201d It is unclear how Youthforia created its formulas for foundation shades. George said she now feels\u00a0it\u2019s important to call out brands and the industry as a whole when they\u00a0exclude darker complexions. \u201cIt kind of feels like a slap in the face. It kind of feels like you know, not only are we just not being seen, but we\u2019re also just like, not even being considered and it\u2019s just really horrible,\u201d George said. \u201cI feel like it just goes to show how rampant colorism is still in the beauty industry.\u201d \u201cThere are a lot of people in this world, and everyone deserves to be able to try makeup, play with makeup and, you know, just be included,\u201d she added. \u201cThe girls are here. We\u2019ve been here and you know everyone deserves a spot in this industry.\u201d Chambers said Youthforia\u00a0needs to rebuild trust with its audience \u2014 and that starts with making sure the audience feels included and important. Many of the brand\u2019s posts and advertisements on social media feature people of color. \u201cIt\u2019s also just good business,\u201d Chambers added. \u201cThere really is no\u00a0way to be in this industry and not take diversity seriously. I think any brand out here that really wants to continue to grow and evolve \u2026 It makes for a better company.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/youthforia-black-foundation-shade/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_07_style_best-dressed-men-met-gala-2024", "text": "At the Met Gala on Monday night, in and amongst the flower-covered gowns (Gigi Hadid, Jordan Roth), naked dresses (Emily Ratajkowski, JLo) and wet T-shirts (Doja Cat), a quiet champion was rising up through the ranks. The humble suit \u2014 often underestimated and overlooked \u2014 was this year reimagined ad infinitum. Nods to the event\u2019s dress code, JG Ballard\u2019s 1962 short story \u201cThe Garden of Time,\u201d came in all forms. For Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton and actor Nicholas Galitzine, who wore Burberry and Fendi respectively, embroidered flowers crept up jacket corners, discreetly sewn in matching thread. There were blooms-turned-bowties, as was the case with actors Jeremy Strong and Jonathan Bailey. Strong\u2019s custom, all-white Loro Piana suit featured a subtle, white flower underpinning his high-collar; while Bailey\u2019s hand-painted purple, white and gold peony (made from metal, \u201cfor someone who has extreme hay fever\u201d he told Vogue) was courtesy of Loewe. And there was a lot of Loewe. \u201cChallengers\u201d co-stars Mike Faist and Josh O\u2019Connor were both spotted in the label \u2014 which was the film\u2019s official outfitter and a part-sponsor of the Met Gala \u2014 wearing the brand\u2019s distinctive quirky charm well. Faist was fastened with a crochet turnip brooch, a wink not only to the event\u2019s horticultural theme but fashion\u2019s appetite for fresh veg in general; while O\u2019Connor paired his elongated tuxedo with a delightful pair of chintz clogs. Comedian Dan Levy\u2019s now-you-see-them, now-you-don\u2019t floral two-piece was another Loewe creation, as was \u201cFifty Shades\u201d actor Jamie Dornan\u2019s fuzzy take on the mourning suit. A throng of male guests also reminded us of the stem-winding, masculine power of flowers. Usher\u2019s dark and brooding ensemble, designed by Se\u00e1n McGirr for Alexander McQueen, included an enveloping cloak and dramatic bleeding rose (which Usher took full advantage of for the camera). Model Wisdom Kaye looked like a phoenix risen from the ashes in his romantic Robert Wun suit and overcoat, with protruding pleats and rose corsage singed to a crisp. Met Gala host, Bad Bunny, was one of the first to arrive onto the carpet in a custom Maison Margiela ensemble complete with shades, leather gloves and a blackened bouquet fashioned from the same fabric as his suit. Coleman Domingo similarly finished off his billowing Willy Chavarria suit with black-rimmed eyes and a drooping bunch of wistful white lilies. But florals were just one avenue of interpretation for Ballard\u2019s story. Set in an aristocrat\u2019s Palladian villa, a handful of attendees chose to hone in on the idea of court dressing. Barry Keoghan\u2019s antiquated, velvet Burberry suit \u2014 complete with a satin necktie and top hat \u2014 featured not one, but three watches: Two on the wrist and one in the pocket, the latter made in the 1930s. Jeff Goldblum and his stylist Andrew Vottero also took cue\u2019s directly from Ballard\u2019s protagonist, Count Axel. \u201c(Vottero) knew the story and devised this thing with Prada,\u201d Goldblum told Vogue host Emma Chamberlain. The actor arrived in what looked like an opulent opera outfit, holding white gloves in one hand, wearing a trailing white scarf, necktie, boxy overcoat and a dazzling constellation of Tiffany brooches. As always, a few stars miss \u2014 or dodge \u2014 the theme entirely, and menswear this year was no exception. Actor Taika Waititi made the case for a head-to-toe full leather suit, while Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne may have just debuted the first ever naked suit in a matching outfit with his wife. But one thing is for certain, after last night, tailoring will never be the same again.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/07/style/best-dressed-men-met-gala-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_01_style_yves-klein-sculpture-tactile-nude-model-box", "text": "Twice a week this spring, a nude performance artist sits inside a small wooden box in a New York gallery waiting to be touched. Through holes on each side of the box, visitors\u2019 arms reach in and out, encountering skin or hair; lingering to determine the body part or quickly retreating. It\u2019s a form of fast intimacy, uncomfortable, revealing, and perhaps, for some, profound. Conceived nearly seven decades ago by the French artist and \u2018enfant terrible\u2019 Yves Klein, the audacious work, which he titled \u201cSculpture Tactile,\u201d was never carried out during his lifetime \u2014 according to his own writings in 1957, he acknowledged he would have \u201chad the police on my back right away\u201d for doing so. But now, with rules signposted about appropriate behavior and consent\u00a0\u2014 and a nearby guard \u2014 to keep the performance artist safe, the work can today be experienced (literally) firsthand at \u201cYves Klein: The Tangible World\u201d at L\u00e9vy Gorvy Dayan on the Upper East Side. In Klein\u2019s short life \u2014  he died of a heart attack at age 34 \u2014 he made provocative, experimental works in the period after World War II, exhibiting monochrome paintings in his signature blue pigment, directing nude models to imprint their painted bodies on canvas and in one instance hosting a gallery show of an entirely empty room. \u201cYves Klein: The Tangible World\u201d brings together many of the artist\u2019s lesser-seen works. They largely focus on the body, from Klein\u2019s large-scale paintings made from \u201cliving paintbrushes\u201d \u2014 his paint-dipped models \u2014 to a series of fire-based pieces that involved blowtorching canvas around the figures of women. \u201cI wanted to show Yves Klein\u2019s love for the body, and the aliveness that the body represents,\u201d said Dominique L\u00e9vy, a co-founder of the gallery, which represents Klein\u2019s estate. \u201cI feel it\u2019s relevant today to bring (through)\u00a0that deep, human force of life.\u201d At the time Klein was working,\u00a0abstract movements\u00a0had taken hold of the art world, while conceptual art was just beginning to germinate. Klein\u2019s incorporation of performance, his emphasis on process and his quest to harness the ineffable would later become markers of movements in the 1960s. \u201cHe\u2019s the first artist to really incorporate performance as an artistic act and as a practice,\u201d L\u00e9vy said. The atrocities of war, she added, had profoundly influenced creative expression and how artists conveyed the human experience. \u201cThe \u201950s were a moment of rebuilding and rebirth and how you approach the body. And at the same time, it was an incredible period of freedom.\u201d Reimagined for today But staging Klein\u2019s works in contemporary contexts requires contemporary considerations. The artist has been criticized for objectifying women \u2014 the models who acted as living paintbrushes were viewed as instruments for the works, after all, though one has since spoken about what she described as the respectful nature of the collaboration. And offering up a box where visitors can freely and blindly touch a naked person must be carefully planned. Recently, a participant in a 2010 Marina Abramovi\u0107 exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York \u2014 which\u00a0required visitors to pass between two naked artists at the entrance \u2014 sued the museum for allegedly failing to protect him from multiple instances of sexual assault. (MoMA has since moved to dismiss the suit.) Ten years ago, an arts writer who participated in the very first performance of \u201cSculpture Tactile\u201d wrote lightheartedly about the experience for ArtNews, but noted that he and others were groped during the period it was installed at the art fair Independent Projects in New York. For one of the two performance artists involved in this iteration the experience has been \u201caffirming\u201d and \u201cbeautiful.\u201d Hugo Alexander-Rose has spent multiple four-hour periods sitting in the small, enclosed sculpture with a cushion to stay comfortable and his phone in order to signal if he needs water, food, a break or help. As a figure model at the School of Visual Arts, he\u2019s used to sitting in stillness for long durations for art\u2019s sake. And, as a trans man, he told CNN he was curious what it would be like to be engaged with through touch alone, without the snap judgements of sight. \u201cPeople make a lot of assumptions based on first seeing me or first hearing my voice \u2014 especially cisgender people,\u201d he said in a phone call. \u201cSometimes people\u2019s hands will reach in, and they\u2019ll touch my top surgery scar. And\u2026 you don\u2019t know their viewpoints on trans people. They don\u2019t know what I look like, I don\u2019t know what they look like, besides their hands. So it\u2019s interesting being able to connect with people in that way.\u201d L\u00e9vy noted that she isn\u2019t sure if Klein would have only included women in \u201cSculpture Tactile\u201d \u2014 his writings describe hypothetical models as \u201cbeautiful naked models with very round shapes\u201d \u2014 but she emphasized that she doesn\u2019t think the point of the piece \u201cis about the sex of the person\u201d and that \u201cretroactively rewriting (his) intentions is detrimental.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s more about that uncomfortable point of contact\u201d with the human body, she explained of the sculpture. Alexander-Rose said that some people have been vocally nervous about participating, while others have shared meaningful connections with him. Some thank him for the privilege to touch him. \u201cOne person\u2026 cupped their hand to my cheek, and held that for a little bit and didn\u2019t say anything \u2014 we were both existing in silence,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd they took their hand out and I thought I heard them start crying. It was a really powerful and really moving experience.\u201d \u201cIt really urges people to push past their own discomfort. And investigate that (feeling) and lean into it and learn something new.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/01/style/yves-klein-sculpture-tactile-nude-model-box/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}

On Saturday, stars gathered on the steps of The Music Center in Los Angeles for the Gold Gala \u2014 a celebration of Asian Pacific influential talent across entertainment, fashion, technology and more, hosted by the non-profit Gold House. And they were dressed to represent \u2014 many proudly embracing Asian designers and cultural heritage through their red carpet looks. Actor Karrueche Tran stunned in a striking red ao dai with a sheer overlay and headpiece by Vietnamese American fashion designer Thai Nguyen. \u201cI knew I had to represent my culture, half of who I am, in a major way,\u201d she wrote on Instagram. Tran has a Vietnamese mother and African American father. Taiwanese drag queen Nymphia Wind, who recently won \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race,\u201d told CNN that her ensemble by Singaporean designer Sheng Cheong \u2014 a dress and cape featuring a bold print of neon yellow and white \u201claser cut clouds\u201d \u2014 was intended to \u201creimagine what club kids would look like in the Forbidden City.\u201d Elsewhere, Bollywood filmmaker Karan Johar wore an ornately embroidered suit jacket by Rimple and Harpeet \u2014 an Indian fashion brand that specializes in handcrafted pieces inspired by ancient crafts and vintage textiles \u2014 and Indonesian singer Agnez Mo accessorized with golden hair pins and an elegant hand fan. \u201cAnything goes here and that\u2019s what is so celebratory,\u201d TV personality Jeannie Mai told CNN of the event, which is sometimes described as the \u201cAsian Pacific Met Gala.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the one place where you can really represent and be invited to do so.\u201d The glitzy affair honors the Gold House\u2019s annual A100 list \u2014 one hundred Asian Pacific leaders who have made a significant impact on culture and society. Author and TV host Padma Lakshmi, actor Lucy Liu and the cast and creator of Netflix\u2019s Emmy-award winning series \u201cBeef\u201d were among honorees. For actor and comedian Joel Kim Booster, the significance of a gala feting so many people in the AAPI community, was not lost. \u201cEvents like this are so exciting to me because when I was coming up, I think there was a lot of energy like, there\u2019s only going to be one of us in the room,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so rewarding to be in a space like this where we\u2019re all coming together and supporting each other. It\u2019s not something that I grew up imagining I\u2019d have for myself.\u201d There have been barriers across industries; in Hollywood, Asians have historically been underrepresented or stereotyped. But that has changed in recent years. A\u202fjoint study\u202fby Gold House and the USC Annenberg found the percentage of speaking Asian characters in top box-office films in the US rose from 3.4% in 2007 to 15.9% in 2022. The roles themselves are more complex. The age of streaming has also ushered in more opportunities for diverse and daring storytelling \u2014 on and off screen. FX\u2019s Shogun, for example, became an instant hit when it premiered in February. Not only does it feature a predominantly Asian cast who speak mostly in Japanese \u2014 behind the scenes, Japanese experts in everything from samurai dramas to a \u201cmaster of gesture,\u201d were brought in to ensure authenticity. \u201cI think what the industry has realized is that Asian creativity and Asian talent is a) different and b) lucrative. So that\u2019s been wonderful to see people take chances, and how we\u2019ve knocked it out of the park,\u201d Lakshmi told CNN. Many acknowledge there\u2019s more work to be done all around. \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting time to see the Asian diaspora coming together to really tell our own stories, in our time, in our space,\u201d said fashion designer and the gala\u2019s creative director Prabal Gurung. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see that visibility. There\u2019s a long way to go still, obviously we feel that way.

{"id": "2024_04_30_style_ralph-lauren-fall-2024-show-studio", "text": "In recent years and with the rise of social media, fashion shows have become somewhat synonymous with broad spectacle. Just take a look at any of the major European labels\u2019 catwalk showcases, with elaborate, expensive sets, custom-built tents that can accommodate hundreds of guests, and thousands of fans screaming outside for the inevitable celebrity arrivals. Ralph Lauren wanted exactly none of that for his Fall/Holiday 2024 runway presentation last night in New York City. The designer instead looked inward to host something a bit more private, but no less impactful: he invited less than 100 guests to his design studio, nine floors above Madison Avenue. There, the audience \u2014 which, yes, did include A-listers like Kerry Washington, Jessica Chastain, Morgan Spector and \u201cHacks\u201d star Hannah Einbinder; even low-key shows need celebrity wattage, after all \u2014 lounged on leather Mies van der Rohe-inspired chairs as the lights brightened and the proceedings began. The salon-style show \u2014 constructed to recall a very similar runway the designer held for his first womenswear show in 1972, also in his then studio \u2014 struck a calm yet galvanizing chord. \u201cI wanted something more intimate,\u201d Lauren, 84, told CNN afterwards during dinner at The Polo Bar, the buzzy Manhattan restaurant his company launched in 2015. (He was about to dig into one of the eatery\u2019s famed \u201cPolo burgers.\u201d) \u201cAnd I always do what I believe, what feels right.\u201d Supermodel Christy Turlington walked first. She wore a cashmere coat, broken-in trousers and booties all rendered in a pale taupe hue. It set the tone for a color scheme of rich neutrals, which dominated throughout. In fact, unlike Lauren\u2019s Spring-Summer 2024 show, in which Washington was outfitted, the collection featured zero bright colors \u2014 a palette cleanser, rather, by way of lush gray-browns and silvers and faded browns. A number of looks featured western motifs, from cowboy hats to a bandana tie to aged leather jackets. The theme is on trend \u2013 in large part due to Beyonc\u00e9 and her most recent album, \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d \u2013 yet Lauren has long worked western aesthetics into his brand and its ever-aspirational world-building. (Among many other touchpoints of Americana, that is, including the other big talking point of the moment: tennis.) In a way that few can do \u2014 and in a way that Lauren has mastered, and remastered, over the years \u2014 there was also razzle-dazzle woven alongside the neutrality of the collection. A number of dresses were all-over sequined or sparkled, adding a layer of tasteful, luxe glamor. Model Anok Yai\u2019s closing look hit all of the show\u2019s talking points in one: a shimmering silk dress in golden taupe, topped with a cowboy hat. At the afterparty, she wore the same look, accessorizing it further with chunky metal cross necklaces. In Lauren\u2019s words, the collection\u2019s understated colors and its luxe coziness \u2014 even with its pops of glitz \u2014 were \u201cnon-frou frou.\u201d \u201cI wanted it simple,\u201d he explained. At The Polo Bar, where martinis flowed and the dinner went late, Glenn Close was sat to Lauren\u2019s left. She wore a champagne-hued Ralph Lauren jacket; he was in a cowboy shirt with black and turquoise insets. In the glow of the restaurant\u2019s rich wood paneling and golden overhead light, the scene felt briefly like a flashback (I looked around and didn\u2019t see anybody on their phones, except for me, recording my chat with the designer.) It could have been decades ago. And that\u2019s the point. When asked what resonates most with Lauren these days, he said, with the wisdom of over fifty years in business to his name: \u201ctimelessness.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/30/style/ralph-lauren-fall-2024-show-studio/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}

Rowling\u2019s 1997 novel \u201cHarry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone\u201d was the beginning of what would become a worldwide phenomenon. Now, the original illustration for the first edition of the book is going on sale. Expected to sell for up to $600,000 at auction next month, it is the highest presale value ever placed on a Harry Potter-related item, according to auction house Sotheby\u2019s. The watercolor cover art was created by author and illustrator Thomas Taylor. The image features young wizard Harry Potter \u2013 with his unmistakable dark, brown hair, round glasses and lightning bolt scar \u2013 ready to board the Hogwarts Express train for his first trip to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Taylor\u2019s cover was used for several translated versions of the book, the auction house said. However, it was not used for the US edition of the book, which was released with the title \u201cHarry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone.\u201d When the illustration was first up for auction at Sotheby\u2019s in London in 2001, it sold for around four times its estimated sale price, for a record \u00a385,750 (about $106,000), according to a Sotheby\u2019s press release Thursday. In June, \u201cmore than 20 years later, the original illustration returns to auction poised to not only far exceed the value it previously sold, but also to potentially set a new auction record for any Harry Potter related item,\u201d the auction house said in the release. The record for an item related to the book series is currently held by an unsigned first edition of \u201cHarry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone,\u201d which sold for $421,000 at Heritage Auctions in Dallas, Texas, in 2021, according to Sotheby\u2019s. Taylor, just 23 years old at the time, created the original cover image in two days, according to Sotheby\u2019s. At the time of the book\u2019s publication, Taylor was working in a bookshop, where his colleagues would inform customers that their local bookseller was the illustrator of the high selling novel, according to Sotheby\u2019s. The illustration will be offered on June 26 at Sotheby\u2019s in New York along with other works of English an American Literature. The auction house will then offer one of J.K. Rowling\u2019s handwritten original manuscripts for her 2007 book \u201cThe Tales of Beedle the Bard,\u201d on July 10. The manuscript is one of six handwritten by the British author that was originally intended as gifts for people closely involved with the publication of \u201cHarry Potter,\u201d according to the release. Both the illustration and the manuscript will be exhibited at Sotheby\u2019s in New York between June 21 to 25.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/harry-potter-original-illustration-auction-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}

Returning to the Met Gala after five years of absence \u2014 and this time as an event co-chair \u2014 the \u201cChallengers\u201d star stepped out in custom Maison Margiela by John Galliano, referencing a haute couture look he created at Christian Dior in 1999. The deep blue-and-green peacock-esque gown was a theatrical nod to the red carpet theme \u201cThe Garden of Time,\u201d festooned with metallic birds, berries and vines and topped with a towering feather headpiece tucked into a hand-painted forest-green beret by milliner Stephen Jones. Zendaya even had the iconic Margiela makeup to match, with thin brows, dramatic eyes and doll-like skin reminiscent of that of the models from the fashion house\u2019s highly acclaimed couture show in January. Toward the end of the night, Zendaya made a rare move when she surprised everyone with a dramatic second look \u2014 a black taffeta spring/summer 1996 Givenchy by Galliano gown sourced from the Beverly Hills vintage clothing store Lily et Cie. The dress \u2014 which Zendaya bought, according to The New York Times \u2014 was look No. 8 of Galliano\u2019s first collection for Givenchy, which debuted amid the drama that surrounded the announcement of the designer as creative director for the brand. More personally, the look is symbolic of \u201can investment in herself,\u201d Lily et Cie founder Rita Watnick told The New York Times. \u201cIt says, \u2018I am not an emissary for a brand. I am my own emissary.\u2019\u201d Zendaya and Roach accessorized with a headpiece crafted from a bouquet of around two dozen roses, designed by Philip Treacy for Alexander McQueen spring/summer 2007.

{"id": "2024_05_06_style_met-gala-2024-theme-hosts-guests", "text": "Fashion\u2019s biggest night out \u2014 hosted at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York each year on the first Monday of May \u2014 is both a forever-evolving spectacle and a carefully crafted event. A parade of A-Listers dress according to the theme inspired by the Costume Institute\u2019s latest exhibition (some more than others) and walk the steps up to the museum before disappearing inside to enjoy the galleries, dinner and drinks. The Met Gala is taking place on Monday night and it\u2019s time to place your bets: Which showstopping archival piece will Zendaya wear? Who will pull off the most uncanny stunt, topping Jared Leto\u2019s \u201ctwin\u201d or Doja Cat\u2019s feline prosthetics? Inside, which celebs will flout the no-photos rule to sneak bathroom selfies? How late will Rihanna show up? What is this year\u2019s theme and who are the co-chairs? This year, the theme for the red carpet is \u201cThe Garden of Time,\u201d referencing a 1962 short story of the same name by British author J.G. Ballard. Like the New Wave sci-fi story, which takes place in a garden of time-bending florals, the museum\u2019s exhibition, \u201cSleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\u201d highlights connections between nature and technology, using AI, CGI and other tools to breathe new life into hundreds of fragile archival pieces spanning hundreds of years. The theme is chosen each year by Andrew Bolton, curator-in-charge at the Costume Institute. Expect fantastical fashion with floral and sci-fi motifs on the red carpet, and stylists working with luxury houses to resurface famous older looks. The first celebrities to appear will be Gala co-chairs Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny and Chris Hemsworth, the last of whom is making his Met Gala debut. What happens at the Met Gala? A frenzy of A-List arrivals and photographs, the red carpet portion of the evening\u2019s proceedings last for a few hours, but that\u2019s the only part the public sees. Inside, guests tour the exhibition, which opens to the public in the days following the gala, and have a seated dinner. Phones at the table are discouraged, and the seating chart is carefully crafted by American Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, who has organized the gala since 1995. (Wintour has \u201cfinal say\u201d over every guest in attendance, the New York Times has previously reported.) Though the red-carpet and afterparties get the most attention of the night, the gala is above all, a fundraiser,\u00a0whose five-figure tickets raise millions of dollars for the museum each year \u2014 setting a record at nearly $22 million in 2023, according to the recently-released book \u201cFashion\u2019s Big Night Out.\u201d What was last year\u2019s theme? The conceptual theme is expected to be a change of pace from last year, when the dress code was set to honor the late fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld, who died in 2019. Over the decades, tributes to the legacies of individual designers have included Rei Kawakubo, Charles James, Christian Dior, Alexander McQueen and Gianni Versace, with the last two scheduled shortly after the designers\u2019 untimely deaths. To celebrate Lagerfeld, celebrities including Anne Hathaway, Nicole Kidman and Jenna Ortega flocked to the event in designs by Chanel, Fendi and Chlo\u00e9, where he left his indelible mark, but some paid a cheeky tribute to Lagerfeld\u2019s cat Choupette as well (hence Doja Cat\u2019s whiskered beauty look). Not all were pleased with the theme to honor the controversial designer, however, given his history of disparaging remarks about women\u2019s bodies and his refusal to champion more inclusive beauty standards. When did the Met Gala start? The Met Gala debuted in 1948 as a fundraiser for the nascent Costume Institute, organized by fashion publicist Eleanor Lambert. Tickets for the banquet reportedly cost $50 each. Over the decades, the gala has transformed from an industry fete at off-site locations like Manhattan\u2019s Rainbow Room into an A-List phenomenon. In the 1970s, Vogue editor Diana Vreeland positioned the gala as the opening soiree of the Institute\u2019s major exhibitions and invited the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of the fashion world and New York society. Wintour, her successor, has favored high-profile musicians, actors and entertainment figures, turning the gala into one of the most-watched events of the fashion calendar \u2014 and the year. In 2023, the software company LaunchMetrics found that the Met Gala generated nearly double the \u201cmedia impact value\u201d for brands than the Super Bowl, at $995 million. What was the first Met Gala theme? The first theme was \u201cThe World of Balenciaga\u201d in 1973, tied to a retrospective of the couturier Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga; the event was attended by guests including Halston and Calvin Klein, according to \u201cFashion\u2019s Big Night Out.\u201d Early themes included \u201cRomantic and Glamorous Hollywood Design,\u201d \u201cThe Glory of Russian Costume,\u201d and \u201cThe 18th-Century Woman.\u201d But gala-goers mostly kept to conventional eveningwear until the 2000s, when some guests began to have more fun with the themes \u2014 and the internet allowed more eyes on the arrivals. The most memorable themes from the past decade have included \u201cChina: Through the Looking Glass,\u201d \u201cHeavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\u201d and the divisive \u201cCamp: Notes on Fashion\u201d thanks to celebrities including Beyonc\u00e9, Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Zendaya and the Kardashian-Jenners, who use the red carpet to put on a show. Who is banned from the Met Gala? Each year rumors fly about who may be persona non grata at the gala, whether due to any offense towards the event or Wintour herself. But the Vogue editor has only explicitly spoken about one guest she would \u201cnever invite back\u201d in public \u2014 Donald Trump, whom she mentioned on James Corden\u2019s late night talk show in 2017 when asked to name names. Other previous guests have sworn it off, however, including Demi Lovato, Zayn Malik and Tina Fey. In 2015, five years after she made an appearance at the event, Fey said on \u201cLate Show with David Letterman\u201d that the gala is a \u201cjerk parade.\u201d \u201cIf you had a million arms, all the people you would want to punch in the whole world \u2014 they\u2019re all\u00a0there,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean I was there, clearly I was one of them.\u201d Some celebrities backtrack, however. Gwyneth Paltrow famously called the Met Gala \u201cun-fun\u201d in 2013 and said she\u2019d \u201cnever\u201d go again, but returned in 2017 (and 2019). What shouldn\u2019t you do at the Met Gala? Met Gala guests have often broken the no-social-media rule to give a more candid glimpse of who is hanging with who and what goes on behind closed doors. In 2017, that included smoking, as attendees including Bella Hadid and Dakota Johnson lit up cigarettes in the museum bathroom (to the ire of the museum\u2019s donors, reportedly). Despite what the Jason Derulo meme would have you believe, he \u2014 nor anyone else \u2014 has taken a tumble down the stairs. But some guests have famously rumbled\u00a0\u2014 this year marks ten years since the infamous after-party elevator fight between Jay-Z and Solange. A final faux pas? Wearing the same outfit, of course. While it\u2019s been reported that Wintour not only arranges the guest list but also has a hand in their fashion choices, last year, Olivia Wilde and departing \u201cVogue China\u201d editor Margaret Zhang showed up in the same throwback Chlo\u00e9 violin dress in different color schemes. The pair took it in stride, sharing memes on social media about the accident. \u201cGreat minds,\u201d Wilde wrote on Instagram. \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna twin with anyone, make it @margaretzhang.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/06/style/met-gala-2024-theme-hosts-guests/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}

More than 80% of the analyzed sample was made up of minerals that produce a deep red color \u2014\u00a0primarily hematite. The mixture also contained manganite and braunite, which have dark hues, as well as traces of other minerals and waxy substances made from vegetables and other organic substances. \u201cBoth the intensity of the red coloring minerals and the waxy substances are, surprisingly enough, fully compatible with recipes for contemporary lipsticks,\u201d the study authors noted.

But he said the homogenous, deep red color, the compounds used and the shape of the vial \u201csuggested to us it was used on lips.\u201d It\u2019s one of the first examples of an ancient, red-colored cosmetic to be studied, he said, although it wasn\u2019t clear why cosmetic preparations resembling lipstick were uncommon in the archaeological record. \u201cWe have no idea, for the moment. The deep red color we found is the first one we met, while several lighter-colored foundations and eye shadows had been identified before,\u201d he said via email. The use of hematite \u2014 crushed red ocher \u2014 had been documented on stone cosmetic palettes from the late Neolithic, as well as in ancient Egyptian cosmetic vessels, according to Joann Fletcher, a professor in the University of York\u2019s department of archaeology. Whether the vial from Iran was the earliest lipstick, \u201call comes down to what this new discovery was actually used for,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is possible the contents of the vial were used as a lip colour. But they could also have been applied to give colour to the cheeks,\u00a0or for some other purpose, even if the vial looks like a modern lipstick tube,\u201d said Fletcher, who was not involved in the research, in an email. It is \u201cvery plausible\u201d the artifact was a lipstick, said Laurence Totelin, a professor of ancient history in the School of History, Archaeology and Religion at Cardiff University specializing in Greek and Roman science, technology, and medicine. \u201cAs the authors point out, the recipe is not dissimilar to a modern one. The deep red colour is also what we would expect for lip make up,\u201d said Totelin, who was not involved in the study, via email. \u201cThat said, the ingredients are also regularly found in the preparation of ancient medicines, and the vial has a shape that is not inconsistent with a pharmaceutical use,\u201d Totelin said. Floods reveal artifacts Other products previously unearthed in Egypt and the Middle East and studied by archaeologists have included black kohl eyeliners and lighter-colored compounds used as eye shadows or foundations. Unlike other ancient cosmetics, the vial\u2019s concoction had a low lead content. This low level, the researchers suggested, might mean the lipstick\u2019s makers understood the dangers of consuming lead, a naturally occurring toxic metal that can cause numerous health problems. \u201cThere is a long and harsh debate among experts on the toxicity of lead compounds in cosmetics,\u201d Vidale said.  Earlier research on artifacts from the same region that Vidale was involved with \u201csuggests that 5,000 years ago white lead was the base material for facial foundations, meanwhile the content of our deep red preparation, supposedly meant for lips, was almost lead-free. It might have been a conscious choice,\u201d he said.  The preparation contained quartz particles, from ground sand or crystal, perhaps added, the study suggested, as a \u201dshimmery-glittering agent\u201d \u2014 although it was possible they came from the inside of the vial itself, which was finely crafted from a greenish stone called chlorite.  It\u2019s also not clear what the original consistency of the cosmetic would have been \u2014 a fluid or more solid, Vidale said. \u201cThe vial\u2019s slender shape and limited thickness suggest that it could have been conveniently held in one hand together with the handle of a copper/bronze mirror, leaving the other hand free to use a brush or another kind of applicator,\u201d the study authors wrote, citing an ancient Egyptian papyrus dated to the 12th century BC that depicts a young woman painting her lips in such a way as an example. The artifact was among thousands of items unearthed from Bronze Age tombs and graves in the Jiroft region of Iran. The graves \u2014 part of an ancient kingdom known as Marhasi \u2014 were exposed and dislodged in 2001 when a river flooded, after which their precious contents were looted and sold by locals. Many stone and copper items, including the vial, were subsequently recovered by Iranian security forces. The vial is kept in the National Archaeological Museum of Jiroft, where the team took samples. \u201cLike a bolt out of the blue, this civilization was discovered \u2026 when a disastrous flood hit its ancient cemeteries, exposing all kinds of archaeological treasures,\u201d Vidale said. \u201cNow the region is well protected, but serious damages were done,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat we know today is that this was an advanced Mesopotamian-like civilization, a major player in long-distance trade and military ventures, which used its own writing system and was ruled by large cities and powerful, authoritative rulers. The rest is slowly emerging from new excavations.\u201d It\u2019s not clear who would have worn the lipstick \u2014 or in what context. \u201cAs far as\u00a0we know, cosmetics were regularly deposited near the face of the deceased in the graves of the time,\u201d Vidale said. However, given the looting and destruction of the graves, researchers have not been able to link the artifact with specific human remains.

{"id": "2024_04_19_style_wash-day-photos-black-hair-tomesha-faxio", "text": "\u201cI was having wash day with my kids, and I was looking at their hair,\u201d the photographer Tomesha Faxio, a mother of two daughters, explained to CNN in a video call of her new monograph. \u201cI was just sitting in that moment, and it just dawned on me. Like, oh, wait a minute \u2014 this is it. I knew I wanted to showcase our hair in its natural state. I wanted to show the inherent beauty of Black natural hair.\u201d For Black women and children, wash day is equal parts essential maintenance and self-renewal. In my natural-haired family, our weekly or bi-weekly wash day starts with the gathering of the first set of tools; a wide-toothed comb, two body towels \u2014 one that can stand to get wet during the wash, another to wrap hair in afterwards \u2014 as well as shampoo, conditioner and deep conditioner. Once the two washes and conditionings have been completed in the kitchen sink, we head to the playroom, where we finger detangle with a product. Depending on if they\u2019re getting braids or not, my husband or I will blow dry our child\u2019s hair on low heat or let it air dry. (We don\u2019t typically do both of our kids\u2019 hair on the same day.) The process takes maybe three hours, but as a whole hinges on the styling that comes after the wash. This can also take hours, making it feel like every bit of a day. In the series of portraits that make up \u201cWash Day,\u201d Faxio sat with 26 families and took photos as they went through their distinct routines. Though each family had their own methods \u2014 and hair stories, which are shared in texts accompanying Faxio\u2019s photos \u2014 the cyclical nature of washings and styling has made the\u00a0day something that is universally understood, and appreciated, across Black communities. In her approach, Faxio took a pointed interest in hair as it was, versus how it was to become. \u201cI think that there\u2019s been beautiful work done on our hair portraiture and work that\u2019s been done with the hair styled in all these beautiful, intricate ways,\u201d she explained. \u201cBut I hadn\u2019t, at that time, seen a ton of work where the hair was just as is, and that\u2019s what I wanted to capture.\u201d The natural hair movement, with its first wave coming during the Black Is Beautiful era of the 1970s and the second during the digital revolution, has done their part in easing tensions around kinky, unprocessed hair, but old habits die hard. We talk often, after all, about the obsession with hair being \u201cdone\u201d and the intra-communal shame that sometimes comes with natural hair. Even as the Crown Act, a bill meant to stop hair-based discrimination, reverberates country-wide, the predisposition with how Black hair will be perceived \u2018on the job\u2019 \u2014 shorthand for by White observers \u2014 has fed into racist viewpoints and judgments on the acceptability of certain hairstyles. Faxio is hoping her book can further help foster conversations and encourage people to love their hair as it is. \u201cSo many of us have learned to accept ourselves more fully, and, in turn, are able to teach our children to do the same. We are now more informed about why we grew up thinking our hair was ugly\u2026 we can see that that these views are steeped in racism,\u201d she writes in the introduction to \u201cWash Day.\u201d \u201cWhile our children will likely continue to contend with non-inclusive beauty standards, we are putting them in a better position to understand and eradicate them.\u201d Speaking with Faxio, and engaging with her photobook, reminds me of my own childhood wash days. I had a head full of black, thick hair. Keeping me calm during washings was a task; I was afraid of water and recoiled at the idea of each session, let alone the actual practice. One weekend \u2014 my wash days were always on weekends \u2014 my mother needed support. She trotted upstairs to a cousin\u2019s apartment, hoping the elders there would help soothe my fears and step in so she wouldn\u2019t have to do it alone. (She was tired of doing things alone.) There, Mom walked me to the sink, turned the warm water on and started lathering. My aunt and grandmother took turns. I nearly soaked a towel while trying to keep the water from touching my face, but through the fear, I felt cared for. \u201cCalm down. Brooklyn, what if you turn around so your head is facing upward? Right, like that.\u201d  Twenty-five years later, I have a daughter of my own. For us too,\u00a0wash day is a high energy sport \u2014 and it\u2019s also a bonding exercise that neither of us will forget. Therein lies the beauty of the experience. \u201cI learned so much from these moms,\u201d Faxio said. \u201cThe greatest thing for me is a renewed love for wash day and renewed sense of value in the process.\u201d Before she set out to write \u201cWash Day,\u201d she\u2019d try to push back her daughters\u2019 washes because she knew that when it was all said and done, her arms would be sore and she\u2019d want to just melt in bed. Now, though, she welcomes the experience. \u201cIt\u2019s work. But spending time with these moms and thinking about how we are able to pass on love of our hair \u2014 an inheritance of pride and joy in our hair, to our kids,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt just renewed my love for the process.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/19/style/wash-day-photos-black-hair-tomesha-faxio/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_03_style_european-court-italy-getty-museum-bronze", "text": "Italy has the right to confiscate a life-size bronze statue dating back to the second or third centuries B.C. from the J. Paul Getty Villa Museum in Los Angeles, California, where it has been for half a century, according to a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights on Thursday. The ruling came after the Getty Museum asked the European Court of Human Rights to intervene following a 2018 Italian court decree that the bronze statue should be confiscated and returned to Italy. The statue, found at the bottom of the Adriatic Sea by fishermen in 1964, has been at the center of a decades-long effort by Italy to reclaim its \u201cstolen\u201d cultural heritage. According to court documents, Italian officials claim the piece was stolen and smuggled out of the country before being eventually sold\u00a0to the Getty Museum for around $4 million in 1978. The statue \u2014 known in Italy as the \u201cAthlete of Fano,\u201d but named by The Getty Museum as both the \u201cGetty Bronze\u201d and the \u201cVictorious Youth\u201d \u2014 is attributed to sculptor Lysippos and remains one of the most important examples of ancient Greek art from the Classical era, according to Italy\u2019s Cultural Heritage Ministry. The Getty Museum does not agree with the latest ruling. In a statement, they said: \u201cWe believe that Getty\u2019s nearly 50-year public possession of an artwork that was neither created by an Italian artist nor found within the Italian territory is appropriate, ethical and consistent with American and international law.\u201d Italian authorities have been on a quest to recover hundreds of artworks illegally dug out of excavation sites or stolen by so-called tomb raiders and sold on the black market and the Victorious Youth has long been in their sights. In 2007, the Getty returned 40 artifacts of questionable provenance in a landmark deal that paved the way for many other museums around the world to return stolen art and artifacts to Italy and Greece. The Victorious Youth was on the 2007 list, but the Getty refused to return it, citing the fact that it was found in international waters, and therefore not necessarily an Italian artifact. Italy\u2019s Minister of Culture, Gennaro Sangiuliano, said the European court finally set the record straight on the contested bronze. \u201cThe European Court of Strasbourg has recognized the rights of the Italian State with an unequivocal ruling,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe judges were clear regarding the ownership of the \u2018Victorious Athlete\u2019 statue, found in the waters near the Marche coast and then stolen abroad. We will continue our action with renewed determination to have her back in Italy soon,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have interrupted all collaborative relationships with those foreign cultural institutions that do not respect the confiscation provisions issued by the Italian judicial authority for illegal export of cultural goods.\u201d The ministry also said it would now focus on other contentious pieces. \u201cActivities continue to achieve the return from the Louvre Museum of various stolen artifacts\u2026 as well as for the return to Italy of the Doryphoros of Stabia from the Minneapolis Museum.\u201d \u201cThis is not just a victory for the Italian government. It\u2019s a victory for culture,\u201d Maurizio Fiorilli, an Italian government attorney, said after the court ruling. Italy will now work with US authorities to return the statue, a spokesperson for the cultural ministry told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/03/style/european-court-italy-getty-museum-bronze/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_03_style_rosalia-straitjacket-fashion", "text": "On Tuesday, 12-time Latin Grammy winner Rosal\u00eda stepped out in New York wearing an outfit that demanded a double-take. The Spanish pop star wore a dainty white lace prairie dress and a pair of heel-less Rick Owens Cantilever boots, but the main event was shrugged over her shoulders. Her cream-colored canvas coat was punctuated by a series of black buckles and belts. Was it another vintage biker jacket? (Since the release of her third album, \u201cMotomami,\u201d Rosal\u00eda has been spotted in everything from biker-style shield sunglasses to Harley Davidson helmets). But upon further inspection her outerwear looked more medical than motorcycle. The elongated sleeves sewn shut and finished with another fastening buckle meant the singer\u2019s hands were forced to burst through a side seam. Her coat resembled a straitjacket. First invented in the 18th-century, straitjackets were used as restraints in hospitals and asylums. Although they were intended to protect patients from harm, some practitioners regarded the physical binding inhumane, with many campaigning for an alternative treatment. By the counter-cultural movement of the 1960s, a wave of anti-psychiatry thinking broke out \u2014 criticizing not only practices such as restraint jackets and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), but mainstream medicine\u2019s definition of mental illness altogether. Straitjackets and their misuse quickly became a cultural symbol of medical barbarism, in part due to films such as \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest\u201d (1975). In 1994, the New York State\u2019s Office of Mental Health proposed that straitjackets be discontinued after 18 patients died while restrained or in \u201cunsupervised seclusion\u201d between 1988 and 1992. While they are rarely used in modern establishments today, the image of a restraint jacket can still be a potent reminder of bygone asylums and mistreatment. But Rosal\u00eda isn\u2019t the first to attempt to recontextualize the garment in the name of fashion. In 2019, Gucci sent a series of straitjacket-inspired jumpsuits down the runway at Milan Fashion Week. In a white warehouse, 20 models stood still on a green conveyor belt \u2014 each bound by an all-white ensemble, many of which featured buckles and straps. One model in the line-up, Ayesha Tan-Jones, used the runway to stage a silent protest of the looks \u2014 writing on their hands \u201cMental health is not fashion.\u201d On Instagram, Tan-Jones wrote after the show: \u201cStraitjackets are a symbol of a cruel time in medicine when mental illness was not understood, and people\u2019s rights and liberties were taken away from them, while they were abused and tortured in the institution.\u201d \u201cMany of the other Gucci models who were in the show felt just as strongly as I did about this depiction of straitjackets, and without their support I would not have had the courage to walk out (on the runway) and peacefully protest,\u201d they said. The straitjackets only made up half of Gucci\u2019s collection, as the conveyor belt-turned-catwalk was suddenly flooded with colorful clothes more typical of then creative director Alessandro Michele\u2019s style. The brand responded to criticism stating that the \u201cblank-styled clothes represented how through fashion, power is exercised over life, to eliminate self-expression. This power prescribes social norms, classifying and curbing identity.\u201d The luxury fashion house also clarified that the straitjacket-style jumpsuits would not be for sale. In contrast, Rosal\u00eda\u2019s outfit has barely raised an eyebrow. The musician has built a reputation as a sartorial risk-taker, often mixing flamenco influences with on-trend biker chic. And while her outfit has made headlines, it hasn\u2019t caused a debate, perhaps due to the increasing prevalence of shocking ensembles out there. Since the rise of Julia Fox in 2021, we\u2019ve seen dresses made from coat hangers, garbage bags and saran wrap. Last September, Ye\u2019s wife Bianca Censori was pictured in Florence, Italy wearing nothing but a purple pillowcase. Fashion houses previously at the center of public criticism have also risen from the ashes. John Galliano \u2014convicted of hate crimes and fired from Dior in 2011 \u2014 has been reputationally resurrected with a landmark show at Maison Margiela and the release of a new documentary. Similarly, Dolce & Gabbana have rebuilt an impressive celebrity roster after a series of promotional videos advertising their Shanghai show were accused of being racist in 2018. (The brand later released an official press statement that said the event and videos were \u201ccreated especially with love and passion for China and all the people around the world who loves Dolce & Gabbana.\u201d) Is Rosalia making a social statement with her straitjacket-style outerwear, or merely using what was once considered shocking for a street style snap? What is certain is that, in 2024, fashion is a lot more comfortable blurring those boundaries.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/03/style/rosalia-straitjacket-fashion/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "style_article_liu-heung-shing-coca-cola-snap-mic-intl-hnk", "text": "A young man stands grinning in Beijing\u2019s Forbidden City. It\u2019s the dead of winter, and one of his hands is buried deep into the pockets of his long overcoat to protect it from the chill. The other grasps the unmistakable contours of a glass Coca-Cola bottle. Today, Coke is the world\u2019s most famous soft drink and can be found just about anywhere. But back in 1981, when the image was shot by Pulitzer-Prize winning photographer Liu Heung Shing, it was only just getting into the hands of ordinary Chinese people. Liu, who was in his late 20s when he began working for Time magazine in Beijing, felt the country was on the cusp of a great cultural shift following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976.  \u201cThe changes (at first) were subtle, and unless you lived there, you wouldn\u2019t have noticed,\u201d he recalled during an interview at his home in Hong Kong.  He had earlier photographed people grieving for Mao along the banks of the Pearl River in Guangzhou. It was here that he was struck by how differently people carried themselves compared to what he had seen in late-1950s China, where he grew up during the disastrous Great Leap Forward campaign \u2014 a series of failed industrialization policies \u2014 before moving back to Hong Kong as a child. Under Mao, the country went on to suffer from widespread famine and poverty, and the tumultuous years of the Cultural Revolution. But in the aftermath of the Chinese leader\u2019s death, Liu said, \u201csuddenly, people\u2019s steps looked a little bit lighter, they dropped their shoulders and their faces looked more relaxed.\u201d It would prove to be a relatively liberal period in Chinese history \u2014 politically, economically and in terms of everyday life, which Liu captured in candid shots. One photo from the time showed a plastic surgeon and his client after a cosmetic procedure. Another depicted people gathering at a \u201cDemocracy Wall\u201d in Beijing, where they wrote now-unthinkable criticisms of the government. One of Liu\u2019s most iconic images was captured on his way into the Time bureau after he had the strange feeling that something was \u201cmissing.\u201d He turned his car around and, sure enough, a large portrait of Mao that had once hung prominently on a building had been freshly taken down. He quickly shot images of workers gathered around the depiction of the late Chairman, with some of their scaffolding visible in the frame. This was China \u201cmoving out of the shadow of Mao,\u201d he said. \u2018It tastes so-so\u2019 In December 1978, Coca-Cola became the first foreign enterprise permitted to enter the mainland Chinese market since the communist revolution. That same month, Beijing and Washington announced the normalization of Sino-American relations and Deng Xiaoping kick-started China\u2019s transformative economic reforms with his \u201cOpen Door\u201d policy. (Coca-Cola was first introduced to China in the 1920s but had been forced to leave in 1949, along with other foreign companies, by a government that regarded it as bourgeois). Liu had photographed the opening of a joint-venture bottling plant in Beijing, capturing Coke chairman Roberto Goizueta and Chinese trade officials drinking Coca Cola and holding bottles aloft to cries of \u201cganbei\u201d (cheers). He then thought to himself, \u201cNow where do I find a (regular) Chinese person enjoying this (drink)?\u201d He headed to the Forbidden City, with its heavy flow of tourists, and soon found a man named Zhang Wei purchasing a Coke from a small stand. \u201cI remember he made a comment when he drank this syrupy Coke: \u2018It tastes so-so\u2019\u201d said Liu, who ended up taking a few shots with one of the imperial palace\u2019s picturesque pavilions in the background.  The response to Coke itself may have been underwhelming, but the snap perfectly captured the curiosity and openness many Chinese people felt at the time. \u201cAs a photographer, I of course realized the significance. That this man, dressed in a ubiquitous PLA (People\u2019s Liberation Army) coat, was one of the very first people to taste it,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cBut I didn\u2019t realize it would become part of the Chinese collective memory.\u201d The image would be widely published and displayed in the following years, and he later became friends with Zhang. In 1983, it appeared in Liu\u2019s photography book \u201cChina after Mao,\u201d a collection of images taken between 1976 and 1982. More recently he included it in his book \u201cLiu Heung Shing: A Life in a Sea of Red.\u201d   The photographer would go on to document other periods and profound events in the country\u2019s modern history, including the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. And just like those pictures of young student activists calling for democracy, Liu\u2019s Coca-Cola photograph feels part of another era altogether. With its apparent embrace of the new and the foreign \u2014 ideas encapsulated in that most American of drinks \u2014 the image stands in stark contrast to today\u2019s China, where relations with the US are at an all-time low. Xi Jinping\u2019s nationalist agenda has generated increasingly xenophobic attitudes towards the West.   \u201cI realized that the story I did in the last quarter of the 20th century (would) continue to carry relevance into the 21st century,\u201d Liu said. \u201cEspecially with the story of China, I never doubt that these photographs are in the Chinese people\u2019s collective memory. \u201cEven though this memory keeps being re-edited\u2026 the good thing about a photograph, is you cannot re-edit it. It becomes an image seared in people\u2019s minds.\u201d Top image: A 1981 photograph of a man with a Coke bottle in Beijing\u2019s Forbidden City, shot by Liu Heung Shing.

{"id": "2024_03_29_style_kim-kardashian-donald-judd-furniture-cec", "text": "Kim Kardashian\u2019s oft-divisive interior design aesthetic is under new scrutiny. The estate of minimalist contemporary artist Donald Judd filed a lawsuit against Kardashian this week, claiming the fashion and beauty mogul promoted \u201ccheap knockoffs\u201d of his furniture designs. The basis of the suit is a 2022 video Kardashian posted to YouTube, in which she gives a guided tour of the offices for her then-brand new makeup company, Skkn by Kim. (The video, which the suit alleged received some 3.7 million views, was seemingly made private following the lawsuit filing.) While touting her office\u2019s minimalist design, Kardashian specifically praises a sleek, large-scale wooden table with a set of matching chairs that are perfectly sized to slide beneath \u2014 creating a piece resembling less a dining table and more a brutalist sculpture. \u201cThese Donald Judd tables are really amazing and totally blend in with the seats,\u201d Kardashian says, moving a chair out to show the camera. An artist and sculptor, Judd was known for his minimalist designs emphasizing clean whole shapes and industrial materials. As they appear in the video, the table and its matching chairs in Kardashian\u2019s office resemble Judd\u2019s famous La Mansana Table and Chair 84 \u2014 pieces that have become iconic among furniture designers and collectors since they were first produced in 1982. The Judd Foundation still manufactures and sells these designs, though they come at a cost: the table is priced at $90,000, while the chairs retail for $9,000 each. But Kardashian\u2019s wares were not authentic pieces, the Judd Foundation wrote in the lawsuit filed Wednesday against both Kardashian and Clements Design, the interior design firm she worked with in designing the Skkn office space. (And even if they were, the foundation \u201ccategorically prohibits customers from using purchased Donald Judd furniture for marketing and promotional purposes,\u201d it says in its court filing.) The foundation is claiming trademark infringement, copyright infringement, unfair competition, false advertising and false endorsement of the knockoff items. \u201cConsumers who watched the video or read the media coverage were misled to believe Ms. Kardashian\u2019s tables and chairs were authentic Donald Judd pieces,\u201d the foundation states in the filing. It is seeking the profits it argues Kardashian and Clements Design made off the use of Judd\u2019s name. Clements Designs, according to the court filing, said it never claimed the tables and chairs were authentic Judd pieces, and directed the foundation to settle the issue with Kardashian. In a statement provided to CNN, the design firm said the pieces it produced for Kardashian\u2019s office had \u201cobvious key differences\u201d to Judd\u2019s designs. \u201cThe Judd Foundation\u2019s prior counsel acknowledged these differences and since then, we have not heard from them in over a year, and are now being blindsided with a lawsuit,\u201d Clements Design\u2019s statement read. \u201cEfforts were made to resolve this issue amicably at the time and the Judd Foundation was unwilling to settle on reasonable terms. These claims have absolutely no merit.\u201d To add further insult, Kardashian\u2019s knockoffs were also, the lawsuit claims, seemingly made from plywood \u2014 a material that the Judd Foundation does not authorize.\u201d \u201cThese poor-quality imitations masquerading as authentic Donald Judd tables and chairs harm the Donald Judd brand,\u201d the lawsuit argues. \u201cConsumers will see the cheap knockoffs\u2026 and erroneously associate (the) low-grade pieces with the Donald Judd brand,\u201d the lawsuit states. The foundation claimed it also offered to replace the counterfeit tables and chairs with authentic pieces at a discount if Kardashian issued a retraction and edited the video, the lawsuit claims. Representatives for Kardashian offered to promote the Judd Foundation in a social media post, which the foundation rejected, and also offered to issue a retraction in the video caption, but not remove the video, the lawsuit claims. Kardashian did not respond to requests for comment from CNN. Judd, who died in 1994, was very selective about who was allowed to manufacture and carry his designs, paying particularly close attention to the quality of materials used.

{"id": "2024_05_07_style_vintage-red-carpet-fashion", "text": "It\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly when old became the new \u2014 well \u2014 new. But today, as more and more celebrities choose to wear vintage, the all-important stretch of red carpet has started to look more like a museum hallway. At the Grammy\u2019s in February, Miley Cyrus, Laverne Cox and Olivia Rodrigo each arrived in vintage Bob Mackie, Comme des Garcons and Versace respectively. \u201cBig stars in old clothes was the trend of the night,\u201d wrote the New York Times\u2019 fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman. March\u2019s Oscars ceremony was another hotbed of second-hand dressing. Cardi B stepped out at the Vanity Fair after party in a black embellished lace Versace gown from Spring-Summer 2003, while Margot Robbie and Jennifer Lawrence wore Mugler and Givenchy\u00a0\u2014 both from 1996. That\u2019s before taking into account the moments outside of 2024\u00a0 \u2014 Cardi B, again, in Mugler\u2019s 1996 \u201cVenus\u201d shell dress at the 2019 Grammys, or Kim Kardashian in 2022, ascending the Met steps in Marilyn Monroe\u2019s museum-exhibited \u201cHappy Birthday, Mr. President,\u201d gown. More recently, at Monday\u2019s Met Gala, Emily Ratajkowski stepped out onto \u201cThe Garden of Time\u201d themed carpet in a haute couture Versace naked dress from 2001. Part way through the evening, Zendaya made a quick change into a black taffeta Givenchy gown from the same year she was born. But it was Kendall Jenner who made the loudest statement of the night, as she became the first person to wear her vintage 1999 Givenchy look in the public, according to the brand. \u2018The future of fashion\u2019 In reality, A-listers have been digging into the archives of fashion houses for more than two decades. In 2001, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger arrived at the Oscars in a canary yellow 1950s Jean Dess\u00e8s gown. Just behind her was Julia Roberts, minutes away from accepting her Academy Award for \u201cErin Brockovich,\u201d wearing a black velvet Valentino dress with dynamic white piping from 1992. But even industry insiders believe the current appetite for archival looks represents a shift in the fashion ecosystem. \u201cAt the (2024) Oscars, I think we probably saw more people wear archival vintage than ever before.\u201d said Erin Walsh, celebrity stylist to a roster of clients including Anne Hathaway, Selena Gomez and Sarah Jessica Parker, in a video interview with CNN. \u201cIt became the future (of fashion) instantly this year.\u201d One label in particular has been at the forefront of the archival movement. Mugler \u2014 the luxury French fashion house responsible for dressing Zendaya in a 30 kilogram full metal robot suit from 1995. The look, devised for the London premiere of \u201cDune: Part Two,\u201d transcended fashion, making headlines across the internet. According to WWD, the stunt generated a $152 million media impact value for the brand, and was the result of a year\u2019s worth of planning. \u201cEvery year we get countless requests to wear the (Fall-Winter 1997 haute couture) Chimera dress or the robot suit,\u201d Adrian Corsin, managing director of Mugler, told CNN over video call. (The Chimera dress is widely regarded as one of the most expensive couture creations ever made.) \u201cBut it\u2019s really about finding the right moment for us. That was finally the right moment.\u201d Once Mugler agreed to the request made by Zendaya\u2019s stylist and longtime collaborator Law Roach, the logistical talk could begin. What would she wear underneath? The original flesh-toned bodysuit had disappeared over the decades, so they would need a new one to shield Zendaya from the armor\u2019s perspex port holes. How would she get to the venue? The suit doesn\u2019t accommodate bending. Would she be able to walk in the garment? It was initially designed by Jean-Jacques Urcun for a short catwalk strut, while Zendaya needed to climb stairs. But above all else, would she even fit? \u201cThat was the main question,\u201d said Marion Bourd\u00e9e, Mugler\u2019s head of archives. Alterations beyond a slight extension of the legs were off the table, it would either work or it wouldn\u2019t. \u201cIt hadn\u2019t been worn for years and years, and Zendaya\u2019s proportions were quite different from the original model. But at the first fitting we were all quite moved, because it fit like a glove.\u201d Inside the archive Before the look was given a second lease of life, it had spent years in Mugler\u2019s archives \u2014 a secret place somewhere in the center of France that houses more than 6,000 priceless pieces. \u201cIt\u2019s very hidden, you wouldn\u2019t imagine from the outside that it\u2019s there,\u201d said Bourd\u00e9e. \u201cNobody has access to that place. Just Adrian and me.\u201d There, the suit was preserved in a custom box; the inside molded to the shape of each segment like a gun case. \u201cIt floats there basically, in this coffin box,\u201d said Corsin. Although interest in vintage fashion is rising amongst celebrity clients, not everyone is qualified to physically handle these pieces. \u201cUnfortunately there\u2019s some misconception around what a fashion archivist really is,\u201d said Julie Ann Clauss, owner of The Wardrobe\u00a0\u2014 a private LA-based storage service used by brands and individuals alike \u2014 in a video call. \u201cA lot of people use the term really broadly. I have a museum studies degree, and all professional archivists do.\u201d Clauss, who also works as an archivist for Tom Ford, said she was required to take college-level chemistry, as well as learn a second language, before qualifying in her role. \u201cYou need to understand the things that will go wrong if fabrics are stored improperly, or glass beads for example. There are so many different things that happen just as a natural result of chemical reactions between the piece and the environment, or the way it\u2019s handled.\u201d Archival storage spaces, like the one that stowed the 1995 Mugler robot suit, are more than just big closets filled with racks of clothes, too. Clauss\u2019 museum standard facility in LA preserves collections for a range of clients \u2014 from Calvin Klein, Marc Jacobs and Carolina Herrera to musicians and actors. \u201cIt\u2019s very clean, usually very white,\u201d she said. \u201cDust attracts pests. Moths don\u2019t eat garments, they eat protein and that\u2019s what they\u2019re going for on your sweater\u2026 It\u2019s the pieces of your hair, proteinaceous things.\u201d From the temperature down to the humidity, everything is painstakingly controlled to suspend the process of deterioration. Even the light must be filtered. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the lights on, unnecessarily,\u201d said Clauss. \u201cOtherwise you\u2019ll get what\u2019s known as light fugivity\u2026 where exposure causes fibers to weaken and eventually shatter and rip.\u201d Fashion\u2019s rat race But if these one-of-a-kind pieces are so fragile, and the method of their conservation so exact, how do celebrities even get their hands on them? \u201cI don\u2019t loan out,\u201d said Clauss. \u201cBut I get calls from stylists all the time that are under the impression I do. It\u2019s up to my individual clients. I redirect (the request) to the brand\u2019s press team who will make the decision.\u201d Who gets to borrow directly from brands is often a hierarchical question. \u201cRequests have increased a lot,\u201d said Bourd\u00e9e back at Mugler. \u201cSince Cardi, and even more after Kylie. But we want the loans of archives to remain exceptional.\u201d Jenner, who has been loaned three vintage looks by the label, sent a team to scout around the Brooklyn Museum\u2019s 2022 exhibition \u201cThierry Mugler: Couturissime\u201d before it was even finished to select her outfit options for opening night. \u201cWe allowed her stylists to come to the museum while we were still installing the looks on the mannequins, and they chose pieces that they would want to try on Kylie,\u201d Bourd\u00e9e said. But not everyone finds this level of access impressive. In 2022, when Kim Kardashian borrowed Marilyn Monroe\u2019s 1962 gown from Ripley\u2019s Believe It Or Not!, many on social media claimed the dress had been ruined \u2014 spurred on by photos of missing crystals and loose threads. (A few months later, Ripley\u2019s issued a statement insisting the garment did not suffer any damage and was received in that condition when won in a 2016 auction.) The International Council of Museums agreed that in the interest of preservation, historic pieces \u201cshould not be worn by anybody, public or private figures.\u201d Mugler, however, believes the risk is worth the reward. \u201cIf it\u2019s always stuffed away in boxes, people won\u2019t get to enjoy it,\u201d said Corsin. \u201cAnd even in exhibitions, pieces can be damaged,\u201d added Bourd\u00e9e. \u201cPeople fall into the displays.\u201d There are other options, too, says Erin Walsh, for those who are not able to leisurely browse museum-grade archives. \u201cPeople make it sound so mysterious to get great vintage,\u201d she said. \u201cVintage is wildly accessible. I\u2019ve been using (stores) like Shrimpton Couture, New York Vintage or Decades since I started my career 15 years ago.\u201d And while it\u2019s tempting to think the recent uptick in vintage was purely a renewed appreciation of fashion history, Walsh suspects there is a more practical answer for why the desire for older garments has skyrocketed. \u201cThere weren\u2019t enough samples (of current designer pieces),\u201d she said. \u201cIt seems like everybody\u2019s in a rat race to finish something very quickly, or there\u2019s not enough that can be made.\u201d Between awards season and fashion week preparation, Walsh believes designers are buckling under the increasing pace of the industry. \u201cThis need for pulling archive pieces, it really just highlights what\u2019s happening in the fashion marketplace. There\u2019s too many (events) for people to go to. We\u2019re being put into a situation where I don\u2019t think anybody can keep up with it. We\u2019re having to go with a different solution, there\u2019s no other way to keep up with demand.\u201d According to The Hollywood Reporter, fashion showrooms were reportedly \u201cwiped clean\u201d in January, following a backlog in press tours, premieres and events caused by the SAG-AFTRA strike last autumn. \u201cNobody was doing anything, then suddenly all the awards were at the same time. Anybody who was on the award circuit or who works in fashion didn\u2019t have one weekend off in three months,\u201d said Walsh. But whether it was born out of necessity or not, the cultural kudos an exclusive archival pull can bestow is powerful \u2014 for both the brand and the wearer. At the Met Gala, Kendall Jenner\u2019s vintage Givenchy gown made instant headlines across the internet. \u201cIt\u2019s such a special moment,\u201d she told Vogue on the night. \u201cI feel extremely honored that they\u2019re allowing me to wear it.\u201d And the more precious the garment, the more prestigious the outfit. Is there anything Mugler would never consider loaning, even for Zendaya or the Jenners? \u201cNever say never,\u201d Corsin said. \u201cEven the Chimera, one of the most coveted pieces in fashion history of the 20th century. All I can say for the moment is it hasn\u2019t been loaned out.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/07/style/vintage-red-carpet-fashion/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}

This is how many of George Michael\u2019s fans remember the late, great singer\u2014and his image has now been immortalized just so on a new collectible coin issued by Britain\u2019s Royal Mint. Visitors to the institution\u2019s website had to wait in a virtual line to shop for the limited-edition coins, which went on sale at 9 a.m. (4 a.m. ET) local time on Monday. The design of the coin pays tribute to the late singer\u2019s second solo hit single, \u201cFaith,\u201d according to the Royal Mint. In a statement published online, the mint, which is the official producer of Britain\u2019s coins, said the George Michael coin is the latest addition to its Music Legends series. Similar issues have honored fellow British music stars David Bowie, Elton John and Queen. Officially approved by the estate of the Wham! front man, who died on Christmas Day in 2016 at age 53, the coin was designed by Italian artist and sculptor Sandra Deiana. The headshot is set against an engraving of the refrain of \u201cFaith.\u201d In a statement in the media release, Deiana said she was clear from the start that there were \u201ccertain elements\u201d she wanted to include. She added: \u201cI wanted a detailed portrait that captured his charismatic expression\u2014I was particularly thinking of his iconic sunglasses. It\u2019s amazing to be able to pay tribute to his music and what you see in the design is truly a piece of George Michael\u2019s song.\u201d The coin is available in several different finishes and weights, and ranges in price from \u00a315.50 (around $20) to \u00a32,770 ($3,500). In a career spanning four decades, Michael sold more than 100 million albums, with hit singles including \u201cCareless Whisper,\u201d \u201cFaith\u201d and \u201cJesus to a Child.\u201d The singer, songwriter, producer and philanthropist rose to fame in the early 1980s as one half of Wham!, alongside bandmate Andrew Ridgley. The duo split in 1986 and Michael\u2019s first solo hit was a duet with Aretha Franklin the following year\u2014\u201cI Knew You Were Waiting (For Me).\u201d The issue of the coins comes two months after Wham\u2019s \u201cLast Christmas\u201d reached number one in the UK\u201439 years after it was first released. Welcoming the coins\u2019 creation, a statement from George Michael Entertainment included in the media release said: \u201cOn behalf of George Michael, we are deeply honored that the Royal Mint is paying tribute to him by creating a series of beautifully crafted coins. He would have been enormously proud and genuinely touched that a national institution should have decided to pay tribute to his memory in this way.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/02/26/style/george-michael-commemorated-coins-gbr-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_04_19_style_michael-schumacher-watch-collection-auction-intl-scli", "text": "Eight of Formula One legend Michael Schumacher\u2019s luxury and personalized watches are going up for auction \u2013 and they could sell for more than $4.8 million in total. The rare timepieces will be exhibited in New York from May 3 to May 5, the weekend of the Miami Grand Prix, ahead of the auction in Geneva, Switzerland, on May 13, according to auction house Christie\u2019s. Schumacher\u2019s family holds an array of watches collected by the champion driver over the years and, \u201cmore recently, they decided to part ways with specific watches of the collection, where they believed watch collectors would be able to appreciate the true value of the pieces,\u201d Christie\u2019s head of watches Remi Guillemin told CNN Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re really just extremely happy to have these watches and to have been able to collaborate with the family,\u201d he added. The collection will form part of Christie\u2019s traditional rare watches auction, consisting of vintage and modern pieces of high-caliber watchmaking from brands such as Audemars Piguet, F.P. Journe and Rolex. Standout pieces include Schumacher\u2019s platinum F.P. Journe Vagabondage 1, which holds almost half the estimated value of the entire collection, with an expected sale price of up to $2.2 million. Meanwhile, a Rolex stainless steel Paul Newman Daytona watch is expected to sell for up to $440,000 and Schumacher\u2019s Audemars Piguet Royal Oak watch is expected to sell for up to $280,000. The Rolex watch was named after the Daytona International Speedway in Florida, according to Guillemin, who described the timepiece as \u201cone of the most iconic watches that Rolex ever made.\u201d The white gold Royal Oak chronograph was commissioned as a personalized gift for the seven-time F1 World Championship winner from his early mentor and former Ferrari CEO Jean Todt, according to the auction house. Presented to Schumacher at Christmas 2003, its features celebrate the six Championship victories he had achieved by that time, Christie\u2019s said. The 30-minute register dial is surrounded by six stars, and there are depictions of Ferrari\u2019s famous prancing horse emblem and Schumacher\u2019s red racing helmet. \u201cIt\u2019s a unique watch,\u201d said Guillemin. \u201cWhen you see the watch from afar, you just know that it\u2019s something special and that it speaks to Michael Schumacher.\u201d The platinum Vagabondage 1 watch was also a gift from Todt, but for the following Christmas. So, while it has similar features, its striking red dial hosts symbols that represent the seventh Championship Schumacher won for himself and Ferrari. A prototype of the watch was sold in 2003 to benefit the Paris Brain Institute (ICM) Foundation, of which Schumacher and Todt are founding members, according to the auction house. \u201cThese watches (are) for people who are following Formula One, who have followed, like I have, Michael Schumacher when he was racing. It\u2019s just a true piece of memorabilia and history \u2013 and, on top of that, these two watches are important for watchmaking,\u201d Guillemin added. Schumacher sustained a brain injury after suffering severe head trauma during a skiing accident in 2013. He has not appeared in public since, but his wife Corinna said in a 2021 Netflix documentary, \u201cWe live together at home. We do therapy. We do everything we can to make Michael better and to make sure he\u2019s comfortable.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/19/style/michael-schumacher-watch-collection-auction-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_04_29_style_dodecahedron-roman-object-mystery-scn-scli-intl", "text": "Amateur archaeologists in England have unearthed one of the largest Roman dodecahedrons ever found, but mystery surrounds what it was actually used for. The 12-sided object is one of just 33 known to exist in Roman Britain, and one of approximately 130 in the world. It is considered \u201cone of archaeology\u2019s great enigmas,\u201d according to the Norton Disney History and Archaeology Group, an amateur group based in the English region of Lincolnshire where it was found in June. Measuring about 8 centimeters (3 inches) across, the dodecahedron is hollow and covered with 12 holes of varying sizes. The 1,700-year-old object will be displayed at the Lincoln Museum from May 4 until early September. \u201cIt\u2019s a real pleasure to have the Norton Disney dodecahedron joining us\u2026 just a stone\u2019s throw from where it was found,\u201d Andrea Martin, exhibitions and interpretations manager at the museum, said in a Lincolnshire County Council press release. \u201cTo have the opening of the display coincide with the Lincoln Festival of History is a real coup.\u201d The release describes the dodecahedron as \u201cone of the largest examples\u201d discovered. However, experts still aren\u2019t sure exactly what the Romans used the dodecahedron for. \u201cIt is completely unique,\u201d said Richard Parker, secretary of the Norton Disney History and Archaeology Group, adding that no similar objects have ever been found. He said that, unlike other dodecahedra, this one is undamaged. \u201cOurs is absolutely in a fabulous condition. It\u2019s complete, undamaged, and it clearly was considered of great value by whoever made it and by those that used it,\u201d Parker said. \u201cSo there must have been a very important reason for it to be deposited in the ground in the way that it was.\u201d Parker told CNN there are no descriptions of the dodecahedron in Roman literature, and they have not been depicted pictorially in mosaics. There are also several features that make it difficult to discern what its intended purpose was. All of the dodecahedra are of different sizes, meaning they were not used for measurement, he said. Because it is undamaged with no signs of wear, it is unlikely to have been a tool, Parker added. Parker\u2019s group does have one working theory, however. \u201cMost likely they were some form of religious or ritual object,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Romans were a very superstitious lot, and generally required signs to allow them to make decisions in their daily lives.\u201d One indication supporting that idea is that the object was found near a small Roman mounted rider god figurine with \u201cstrong religious connections,\u201d Parker said. The artifact was discovered in 1989 by metal detectorists, and the figurine is \u201coften found on temple sites.\u201d The organization plans to return to the dig site later this year to conduct further excavations, which Parker hopes will help establish context on how the area was used. Parker said he is optimistic that the mystery will be solved because this dodecahedron was found in an archaeological excavation area, whereas \u201cmany of those that were found 200 or 300 years ago had no context to where they were found.\u201d \u201cIt is quite a complex story to tell that we\u2019re just starting to tease out,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/29/style/dodecahedron-roman-object-mystery-scn-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}

Work is set to start at the end of this year and the area is expected to house more than 60,000 people when completed. ZHA\u2019s associate director, architect Paolo Zilli, told CNN he spent around a year finalizing the model he presented to Oman\u2019s Ministry of Housing and Urban Planning. Central to ZIlli\u2019s design was facilitating access to public transport. \u201cThe vision is actually to remove all the cars, to remove all the fences and to create a campus of the ministry with many functions that can attract families and a new generation,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_05_03_style_first-luxury-watch-buyer-guide", "text": "Navigating the world of \u201chaute horologie,\u201d the highest form of watchmaking, can be intimidating for a beginner. If you\u2019ve found yourself in the enviable position of shopping for your first luxury timepiece, you will likely have more questions than answers. From understanding the terminology, to knowing where to shop, the questions to ask yourself before you set foot in a store (or auction house) and how to avoid buying a fake, CNN Style has done the research and asked experts for their top tips. 1. Learn the lingo Just like buying a car, there are some technical terms prospective watch buyers can benefit from knowing. Here are a few: a. Parts of the watch  Crown: Small knob found on the side of the watch used to change the date and time. On a manual watch, the knob is used to wind it so the movement keeps going. Movement: The complex mechanisms that make the watch run.\u00a0 Bezel: The frame that holds in place the crystal protecting the watch face. Lug: The parts that connect the watch case to the bracelet (strap). Complication: A watch function beyond regular time-telling. Sometimes watches can have several added \u201ccomplications.\u201d For example, a chronograph has a stopwatch, while one with a perpetual calendar shows the month and day of the week, and a GMT tells the time across multiple time zones.\u00a0 Skeleton: A watch that showcases rather than covers up its inner workings. Tourbillon: An additional mechanism said to improve the accuracy of a watch. Most modern-day watches do not need a tourbillon to be highly accurate, but the complicated mechanism often pushes the price up.\u00a0 Quartz movement: Battery-powered watch. Automatic movement: A mechanical watch that does not need a battery to move, it relies on movement from the wearer to wind. b. Other useful terms Grey market: distribution or selling channels not officially authorized by the original manufacturer like forums, Instagram or Facebook marketplace. Reference: Model number that can tell you details about the watch; what it\u2019s made of, the design specifications etc.  Blue-chip brands: Well-known and reputable watchmaker brands like Patek Philippe, Cartier, Rolex and Vacheron Constantin with history and a track record of producing excellent timepieces. 2. Decide if you want a new or pre-owned watch Are you looking for the latest model from a trending brand, or are you interested in investing in a piece of history, or a timeless classic? If it\u2019s a new release, bear in mind these often come with a lot of fanfare \u2014 and a long waiting list \u2014 so you may find yourself lusting after a watch that simply can\u2019t be purchased within the timeframe you\u2019d like. Luxury watchmakers often require buyers to effectively \u201cprove\u201d their commitment to buying a popular model by requiring them to buy less coveted models before they can purchase the watch of their dreams \u2014 which can have waiting lists that can be months or years long, said the head of Sotheby Asia\u2019s watches department Joey Luk.Some, like independent watchmaker Charles Frodsham & Co. she adds, have a more than 10 year wait. \u201cDon\u2019t bother with it,\u201d said Hong Kong-based co-founder of The Horology Club Johnathan Chan, of the expectation for shoppers to buy watches they don\u2019t need to ultimately be able to get what they want. Given the time and money involved, he believes it makes more financial sense to pay a slight premium for a watch from a reputable second-hand dealer with clear provenance. If you are open to buying second hand, there\u2019s a thriving pre-owned luxury watch market out there, but be aware of the risks if you\u2019re not working with a trusted dealer who is able to certify the authenticity of the timepiece pre-sale. Think carefully about where you are shopping. An unknown, first-time seller on Facebook marketplace will likely warrant more scrutiny than a well-established dealer with a long list of previous customers who can vouch for them. Auction houses such as Christies and Sotheby\u2019s have in-house experts tasked with vetting the watches that they take in, and newer second-hand platforms such as Chrono 24 verify all the dealers on their site. This doesn\u2019t mean fakes don\u2019t make it onto the market, so you must do your research and \u2014 if possible \u2014 get the watch verified by the brand directly before completing the purchase. But if you\u2019d rather not take on any risk, going direct to a retailer may be your best bet. Away from the trending new models, there are of course plenty of good quality watches to be purchased direct from the maker. \u201cAt least you know there\u2019s someone to go to if anything goes wrong,\u201d said The Horology Club co-founder Helbert Tsang. 3. Buy a watch for the right reasons and consider what you need from it Don\u2019t get sucked into hype around a watch. This is a personal investment that you\u2019ll likely want to love wearing for a long time. Also, be careful if resale value is your main motivation. Tim Stracke, founder and chairman of leading watch resale platform Chrono24 said,\u201cI always (advise) don\u2019t first of all look at the financial returns,\u201d he said during an interview at the Watches and Wonders Fair in Geneva earlier this month. \u201cLook at the emotional return; what do you really like, what makes you smile every time you look at a piece?\u201d Sotheby\u2019s Luk agrees: \u201cAlways pick your favorite watch,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like the watch and you just bought that for investment, then it\u2019s going to be a waste, because it\u2019s going to sit in the safe forever.\u201d Ask yourself, what do I need the watch for? Is it something you\u2019ll wear to play tennis or to time your swim laps? In which case you may want a sturdy, waterproof, sports watch with a high degree of accuracy, said Luk. Maybe you\u2019re in the market for an elegant dress watch to wear to a wedding or you\u2019re looking for a mechanical masterpiece or a conversation-starter with a unique design. Are you shopping for an anniversary or birthday present for someone special? Perhaps select a model from a year that holds sentimental value. Luk also advises first-time buyers stick with established blue-chip brands that have a longstanding history. \u201cThey have a better reputation for quality and there is more info. on the market \u2013 it would be easier for beginners to do their research, check their historic prices and compare to the recent results,\u201d she told CNN via text message. These brands, she wrote are \u201cmore reliable and the prices are relatively stable,\u201d compared to lesser-known brands \u201cwhere there is limited info. online and it\u2019s difficult to monitor the price.\u201d 4. Try it on. Comfort is key Avoid buying anything you can\u2019t try on yourself. Just because a watch looks good in an advert or on a celebrity\u2019s wrist, it might not suit you. Watches can look very different in real life. Collector Carlos Pang, another co-founder of The Horology Club, found this with the Patek 3940. \u201cIt\u2019s a 36mm diameter watch, which for a lot of people might be a bit small, looking at the specs. But, once you try it on, the way the case is (designed), it\u2019s a bit fuller.\u201dAnd remember that you\u2019ll be wearing it for long stretches of the day, so comfort is essential. Consider the weight of the watch, and the material of the strap, for example. \u201cI definitely value wearability a lot,\u201d said Helbert Tsang. 5. Like a watch, but can\u2019t afford it? See if the designer made any others While on the lookout for a watch to wear to his wedding, Pang saw a six-figure Audemars Piguet watch. \u201cI really liked that watch\u2026 but at that time I didn\u2019t have much money,\u201d he said. Instead, he did his research and found the designer, in this case Gerald Genta, who had made watches for other brands that were more affordable. \u201cI went with the IWC Ingenieur in the end. I bought it secondhand and that\u2019s the watch I wore to my wedding. I still have that one today.\u201d 6. Take it slow Don\u2019t rush into the decision, in fact, it\u2019s sometimes best to shop without any real intention to buy, said Chan. \u201cGive yourself time to figure out and try different things, whether it\u2019s going to watch meets to check out watches, going to different stores, going to auction houses, but just experiencing more things so that you know yourself more and what you like.\u201d Watch enthusiast groups like The Horology Clubs organize meets where members bring timepieces from their collections to show and discuss. You can find the nearest one to you with a quick search on the internet and on social media. Chrono 24\u2019s Stracke adds:\u201cA watch purchase is often a purchase for life\u2026 don\u2019t mind taking the time even if it takes half a year, a year or even longer to find the piece you really want.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/03/style/first-luxury-watch-buyer-guide/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "style"}}
