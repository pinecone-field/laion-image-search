{"id": "2024_05_02_style_youthforia-black-foundation-shade", "text": "When cosmetic company Youthforia launched\u00a0its \u201cDate Night Skin Tint\u201d serum foundation\u00a0line in 15 shades last year, some beauty influencers and reviewers were critical\u00a0of the lack of options for darker skin tones. Golloria\u00a0George, a Texas-based beauty influencer with over 1.5 million followers on TikTok,\u00a0shared\u00a0why\u00a0she felt\u00a0the brand had missed the mark\u00a0\u2014 and an opportunity \u2014\u00a0in a TikTok video last September\u00a0that racked up more than 2.4 million views. In her series, \u201cThe Darkest Shade,\u201d George reviews the darkest shade in a brand\u2019s lineup to see if it could match her complexion. The darkest Youthforia shade,\u00a0she claimed,\u00a0was lighter than what was advertised online and didn\u2019t match her skin tone. It\u2019s a criticism many brands have faced over the years, as the beauty industry \u2014 which critics have long accused of\u00a0elevating Eurocentric beauty standards\u00a0\u2014 tries to expand its product lines for melanated skin tones. Youthforia\u00a0is a \u201cclean and sustainable makeup company\u201d that markets\u00a0itself as \u201cmakeup you can sleep in,\u201d according to its website. The company\u2019s founder, Fiona Co Chan, appeared on an episode of the TV series\u00a0\u201cShark Tank\u201d that aired in 2023\u00a0and\u00a0received a $400,000 investment from\u00a0billionaire Mark Cuban. In March, the beauty brand\u00a0added 10 new shades\u00a0to its \u201cDate Night\u201d collection, many for darker complexions. George told CNN she was still unsure if one of\u00a0the new products would be a match, so she again tried the brand\u2019s darkest shade \u2014 600 Deep Neutral \u2014 and was stunned by the result. \u201cWhich side of my face is the black face paint or the\u00a0Youthforia\u00a0foundation?\u201d\u00a0she asked in\u00a0a Tiktok\u00a0video posted April 30. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell. You know why? Tar in a bottle.\u201d That video now has over 24 million views. Youthforia did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Last year, Chan defended her brand in a post that has since been deleted.\u00a0Earlier this year,\u00a0days before the new products launched, Youthforia\u00a0posted a video\u00a0on TikTok where Chan says the brand had trouble finding models to match the darkest shades they offer. \u201cSo a month ago we held a casting call to just look for real people, real skin. We found matches for most of our shades except for our dark shades,\u201d she says in the video. In the days that followed, the brand posted\u00a0a series of view of videos showing Chan searching for models and ultimately testing the foundation on two young men who \u201cgraciously agreed to be our models\u201d in a mall. She applies the 600 foundation \u2014 the same one George used \u2014 to half of one model\u2019s face and remarks on how it appears to be a match. \u201cHis undertone was actually perfect,\u201d she says. Last week, Youthforia replied to a comment about the brand\u2019s darkest shade by resharing the video from March. While George acknowledges the shade may work for some customers, she\u00a0also\u00a0posted a separate video where she reviews the brand\u2019s second darkest shade, 590, which she notes \u201cleans very red on me.\u201d George told CNN she found the transition between the two darkest products offered by Youthforia to be \u201cshocking.\u201d \u201cIt was like we really just missed a whole range of undertones and depth and it\u2019s disrespectful,\u201d she said. And she\u00a0wasn\u2019t the only one remarking on the brand\u2019s attempt to provide products for darker skin tones, with other content creators calling out the brand and\u00a0even trying to mix shades together\u00a0to create lighter options. George told CNN\u00a0 the saga reminded her of not being\u00a0able to\u00a0find shades of makeup that matched her complexion when she was younger. \u201cIt was a big deal. It was really disheartening,\u201d she said. \u201cI really felt like there was something wrong with me, you know, and no one deserves to feel like that.\u201d Karen Chambers, chair of the diversity, equity & inclusion taskforce at Cosmetic Executive Women, said\u00a0Youthforia is not the only brand to face this sort of criticism from customers. The success of Rhianna\u2019s FENTY launch in 2017 saw many makeup brands working to expand their product offerings. But in 2020, influencers called for a boycott of Hourglass Cosmetics after the company released a\u00a0fan-favorite foundation\u00a0with a limited shade range. In 2018, Tarte\u2019s Shape Tape line also faced similar criticism, causing beauty influencer NikkieTutorials to\u00a0remove a video\u00a0about the product and call their shade range \u201can absolute mess.\u201d Chambers, who has\u00a0worked with brands such as\u00a0IMAN Cosmetics, Dark & Lovely and Posner\u00a0throughout her 28-year career, said\u00a0in the past five or so years brands have recognized the need for more conversations around diversity and inclusivity. \u201cWhether it\u2019s domestically or globally, demographics are changing and if a brand is not inclusive in what they offer, then they are just missing a huge opportunity as far as just accurately being there for their consumer base,\u201d\u00a0she said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve seen brands that have gotten (an) \u2018A\u2019 in their efforts to diversify and we\u2019ve seen brands that have gotten an \u2018F\u2019\u00a0and everywhere in between.\u201d In addition to research,\u00a0Chambers said, the\u00a0businesses\u00a0should incorporate diversity as a whole. \u201cCertainly as in this instance, in those laboratories, you\u2019ve got to have someone who understands that creating darker shades for brown skin is not as easy as adding black to an existing one that\u2019s created for light skin.\u201d It is unclear how Youthforia created its formulas for foundation shades. George said she now feels\u00a0it\u2019s important to call out brands and the industry as a whole when they\u00a0exclude darker complexions. \u201cIt kind of feels like a slap in the face. It kind of feels like you know, not only are we just not being seen, but we\u2019re also just like, not even being considered and it\u2019s just really horrible,\u201d George said. \u201cI feel like it just goes to show how rampant colorism is still in the beauty industry.\u201d \u201cThere are a lot of people in this world, and everyone deserves to be able to try makeup, play with makeup and, you know, just be included,\u201d she added. \u201cThe girls are here. We\u2019ve been here and you know everyone deserves a spot in this industry.\u201d Chambers said Youthforia\u00a0needs to rebuild trust with its audience \u2014 and that starts with making sure the audience feels included and important. Many of the brand\u2019s posts and advertisements on social media feature people of color. \u201cIt\u2019s also just good business,\u201d Chambers added. \u201cThere really is no\u00a0way to be in this industry and not take diversity seriously. I think any brand out here that really wants to continue to grow and evolve \u2026 It makes for a better company.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/youthforia-black-foundation-shade/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_04_04_style_taipei-101-earthquake-design-intl-hnk", "text": "The deadly 7.4 magnitude earthquake that hit Taiwan on Wednesday and left at least 9 people dead, also damaged 770 buildings, according to the latest estimates from the island\u2019s National Fire Agency (NFA). In the capital Taipei, just 80 miles away from the epicenter, buildings also shook violently during what was Taiwan\u2019s strongest earthquake in 25 years. But in a triumph of modern engineering, the soaring Taipei 101, once the world\u2019s tallest skyscraper, emerged from the island\u2019s latest seismic event undamaged. Footage from the quake appears to show the 1,667-foot-tall tower slightly swaying, its structural flexibility helping to counter the powerful motion of the quake. This movement perfectly demonstrated how the skyscraper\u2019s single most important defense against earthquakes is the very material it is constructed from: reinforced concrete. Combining concrete\u2019s compressive strength with steel\u2019s tensile strength, the material makes the building flexible enough to sway, yet rigid enough to resist high winds and the typhoons that frequently hit Taiwan. (The principle that buildings can endure seismic forces by moving with them, rather than against them, has underpinned traditional architecture in earthquake-prone East Asian countries for centuries, from Japanese pagodas to Chinese palaces.) High within the tower,\u00a0however, another technological innovation helps protect the 101-story skyscraper \u2014 a huge orb-like device known as a tuned mass damper. Giant counterweight Suspended from 92 thick cables between the 87th and 92nd floors, the golden steel sphere can move about 5 feet in any direction. As a result, it acts like a pendulum that counteracts (or \u201cdampens\u201d) swaying motions. \u201cIt\u2019s essentially a very large counterweight,\u201d explained Stefan Al, author of \u201cSupertall: How the World\u2019s Tallest Buildings Are Reshaping Our Cities and Our Lives,\u201d in a phone interview. \u201cIn the case of Taipei 101, it\u2019s 660 tons. That seems really heavy, but if you compare it to the overall weight of the building, it\u2019s just a fraction. \u201cWhen a building starts to shake, (the tuned mass damper) will move in the opposite direction. In the case of Taipei 101, it\u2019s suspended\u2026 so it will lag behind as the tower sways and will absorb the kinetic energy by moving in the opposite direction,\u201d Al said, explaining that hydraulic cylinders between the ball and the building convert this energy into heat, which is then dispersed. Tuned mass dampers are used in skyscrapers around the world, including the \u201csuper-skinny\u201d Steinway Tower in New York and Dubai\u2019s sail-shaped Burj al-Arab, which has 11 of them. The device crucially protects against the violent motion caused by \u201charmonic vibration,\u201d which can cause structural failure during an earthquake, Al said. \u201c(That\u2019s) when buildings start to vibrate at their own resonance,\u201d he said, comparing the phenomenon to a tuning fork. \u201cThis can lead to a collapse, (as the building) will start shaking faster and faster and faster.\u201d Tuned mass dampers, which are also known as harmonic absorbers, are \u201ctuned\u201d to resonate at the same frequency as the building \u2014 but with wavelengths starting earlier or later, helping to dissipate the potentially catastrophic energy. The stability they provide can also reduce the uncomfortable \u2014 or even nauseating \u2014 effect swaying can have on a building\u2019s occupants in high winds. Structural support Designed by Taiwanese firm C.Y. Lee & Partners, Taipei 101 was the world\u2019s tallest building from 2004 until 2007, when it was surpassed by the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. An observation deck overlooking its groundbreaking tuned mass damper is now a popular visitor attraction, especially when it moves during strong winds. The giant sphere is not, however, the only design feature helping stabilize the tower, which stands close to a major fault line. For one, the skyscraper sits on exceptionally deep foundations \u2014 namely 380 reinforced concrete and steel piles drilled down into the bedrock below. Above them, the building\u2019s core is connected to a series of \u201cmega-columns,\u201d located around its perimeter, via enormous steel outrigger trusses. The high-rise complies with strict anti-seismic building codes that are as stringent as one might expect on an island located along the \u201cPacific Ring of Fire,\u201d which runs around the edge of the Pacific Ocean and causes massive seismic and volcanic activity from Indonesia to Chile. But while the design also underwent extensive digital modeling and \u201cshake table\u201d testing (in which scale models are tested on a device that replicates the movement of an earthquake), how a building like Taipei 101 would react to a stronger or closer seismic event remains, to an extent, theoretical. \u201cEven though we have computer simulations, there\u2019s still something about the physical that that we cannot really get from digital simulations,\u201d said Al, adding: \u201cDespite our technological advances, we are still testing (designs) in wind tunnels and shaker tables.\u201d This article has been updated to reflect the latest estimates on the number of buildings damaged.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/04/style/taipei-101-earthquake-design-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_style_china-rihanna-fenty-beauty-promotion-intl-hnk", "text": "There\u2019s a reason why Rihanna is a billionaire. She\u2019s a business mogul in every sense: Aside from a prolific music career, she\u2019s launched successful brands including her cosmetics empire Fenty Beauty \u2013 worth an estimated $2.8 billion according to Forbes \u2013 and her lingerie label Savage X Fenty. Her latest move in China to promote makeup products is something of a masterclass in how to tap into its lucrative \u2013 mostly online \u2013 Gen Z market. On Tuesday night, the chart-topping singer attended a Fenty Beauty pop-up held at a Shanghai photography museum, \u201cservin\u2019 face\u201d according to brand\u2019s Instagram, and \u201cjianbing\u201d \u2013 a popular Chinese breakfast crepe that costs about a dollar. Dressed in a head-to-toe black ensemble, Rihanna cracked an egg, spread yolk, sprinkled scallions, brushed sauce and placed a crunchy cracker onto the savory street food favorite, made on a glittery food cart. Influential makeup bloggers invited to attend captured the spectacle and Chinese social media sprung to life. \u201cShe makes crepes but not her new album,\u201d joked one user on Douyin, China\u2019s TikTok, while another wrote on Weibo, \u201cShe\u2019s so good at it, it\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s her first time.\u201d Rihanna is already a beloved star in China, recently appearing on April\u2019s Vogue China cover. She has been viewed as appreciating Chinese culture, famously wearing a glorious golden yellow creation by master couturier Guo Pei to 2015\u2019s China-themed Met Gala. And the decision to serve up jianbing was a savvy move \u2013 one that embraced the star\u2019s moniker among Chinese fans and displayed knowledge of her audience. In 2011, Chinese fans dubbed her the \u201cQueen of Shandong,\u201d after her hit \u201cWe Found Love\u201d was phonetically translated to \u201cweifang de ai\u201d \u2013 meaning love of Weifang, a city in eastern China\u2019s Shandong province. Jianbing is believed to have originated from the same province more than 2,000 years ago and for many in China, the 36-year-old\u2019s turn at making the humble crepe was a full circle moment, with one viral comment on Weibo reading \u201cshe\u2019s certified her own Chinese nickname\u201d with the act. The jianbing buzz only added to the chatter online about the singer\u2019s appearance earlier in the day on Douyin, where she hosted three livestream sessions showcasing Fenty Beauty lip glosses, blushes and other products. Rihanna then became the number one trending topic on Weibo, with the hashtag #RihannasfirstlivestreaminChina viewed over 81 million times. Another hashtag, #RihannashowsupinShanghai was viewed over 75 million times. Besides being a video app, Douyin is a major platform for online shopping \u2013 with products and discounts displayed on-screen during livestreams and purchases just a swipe or a click away. In 2022, there were more than 460 million livestreaming e-commerce users in mainland China, according to the Academy of China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, a body affiliated with Beijing\u2019s commerce ministry. Other foreign luxury brands have already hosted their own livestream sessions, including Gucci, Dior and Louis Vuitton. China is now the world\u2019s second largest beauty market. Rihanna\u2019s appearance was part of the platform\u2019s wider \u201c618\u201d (or June 18) campaign, one of China\u2019s most important online shopping events after Singles Day in November, that sees widespread promotions starting nearly a month ahead. While Fenty Beauty products have been available in the country since 2019, the brand announced this March that it would be expanding its presence via Sephora stores on the mainland. In 2017, the brand launched with an unprecedented 40 shades of foundation and has since added more. Its outsized profitability has dramatically shifted the beauty landscape, with many companies now offering their own more diverse and inclusive range of cosmetics.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/style/china-rihanna-fenty-beauty-promotion-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_style_becoming-karl-lagerfeld-show", "text": "\u201cI like anonymity,\u201d designer Karl Lagerfeld (played by Daniel Br\u00fchl) tells Jacques de Bascher (actor Th\u00e9odore Pellerin) in the first episode of \u201cBecoming Karl Lagerfeld,\u201d a new six-part series based on Rapha\u00eblle Bacqu\u00e9\u2019s novel \u201cKaiser Karl.\u201d De Bascher \u2014 a fledgling writer and Lagerfeld\u2019s eventual love interest \u2014 has accompanied him to the fashion show of his friend and rival Yves Saint Laurent (played by Arnaud Valois). \u201cOf course,\u201d de Bacher deadpans. \u201cYou dress like the Sun King to go unnoticed.\u201d The Sun King was the nickname of King Louis XIV, who ruled over 17th and 18th century France in a procession of exaggerated sleeves, flowing ruffles and intricately patterned fabric. While Lagerfeld leaves off the tumbling dark wig, de Bacher\u2019s comparison is not unfounded. His wardrobe \u2014 which may occasionally inspire vague comparisons to Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci\u2019s character in \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d) \u2014 is a parade of flared trousers and elaborate tie pins; cravats matched to pocket squares, heeled boots, and a selection of ties that would put Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick in \u201cGossip Girl\u201d) to shame. It is a rich palette of jewel and earth tones; petrol blues and pinstripes. And while his signature starched collar and fingerless gloves are yet to make an appearance, his looks are already topped off with another of his soon-to-be trademarks: a pair of dark aviator sunglasses. Opening in 1972, \u201cBecoming Karl Lagerfeld\u201d \u2014 which premieres on Hulu June 7 \u2014 follows its namesake\u2019s love life and career throughout the decade and into the spring of 1981, halting just before he began working with Chanel in 1983. Having joined ready-to-wear champion Chlo\u00e9 in 1966, Lagerfeld became the brand\u2019s lone designer in 1974. The show follows his drawn-out power struggle with Chlo\u00e9\u2019s founder Gaby Aghion (played by Agn\u00e8s Jaoui), who first discovered his talents but whose stubbornness prevents him from truly showing off his artistic, haute couture genius. It is a noticeable choice by the series creators to portray Lagerfeld so sympathetically. In 2023, when the Metropolitan Museum of Art hosted its gala and corresponding exhibition in Lagerfeld\u2019s honor, critics were quick to point out the numerous controversial statements the designer had made about weight, women, immigrants, victims of sexual assault and gay marriage. In \u201cBecoming Karl Lagerfeld\u201d he is brooding, combative and ambitious, sure \u2014 but we are equally encouraged to root for him. It is instead Saint Laurent who suffers the worst PR: in the love triangle that takes over the plot he is every inch the tortured artist, fawning desperately and pathetically over de Bascher; Lagerfeld, on the other hand, plays the aloof scorned lover. A man\u2019s world? One of the show\u2019s standout lines does point to Lagerfeld\u2019s sexist tendencies. \u201cFashion has nothing to do with women, or there wouldn\u2019t be so many gays in the business,\u201d he tells de Bascher at the same YSL show in the first episode. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of embodying the zeitgeist, of reflecting society\u2019s true nature.\u201d He is then roundly contradicted by Marlene Dietrich (played by Sunnyi Melles) who co-opts his own metaphor in the following episode to tell him, flatly, that \u201ca fashion designer is just a mirror for the woman he\u2019s dressing\u2026 You only exist if the reflection in the mirror pleases me.\u201d These might not be direct quotes from the real life Lagerfeld or Dietrich, but they do show the ego underlying Lagerfeld\u2019s character \u2013 and also pose the interesting question of how gender and power operate within the fashion industry. Despite Dietrich\u2019s protestations, the creators of \u201cBecoming Karl Lagerfeld\u201d seem to side with their muse. Nearly all the female characters across the series appear as emotional support or pretty backdrops \u2014 canvases from which Lagerfeld and Saint Laurent may suspend their art. Parisian fashion in the 1970s was, \u201cBecoming Karl Lagerfeld\u201d suggests, a scene broadly gatekept by a handful of squabbling men. The history of high fashion isn\u2019t that simple, though. Haute couture \u2014 where Lagerfeld was so eager to make his name \u2014 did not exist until 1858, and its arrival upset the existing trend of having female dressmakers. \u201cThe notion of haute (couture) and the client didn\u2019t exist until (Charles Frederick) Worth,\u201d Claire Wilcox, senior curator of fashion at London\u2019s Victoria and Albert Museum, told CNN over the phone. \u201cIt was an important break in fashion history.\u201d Worth opened the very first house, earning the status of haute couture\u2019s \u201cfather\u201d. In a 2014 essay, historian Abigail Joseph wrote that before Worth, women were largely responsible for dressing other women, having first been given the right to enter the industry by \u2014 coincidentally \u2014 Louis XIV in 1675. By the time Worth opened his doors, women designers were so normalized that the idea of a male dressmaker raised eyebrows: Joseph described the accusations of effeminacy and \u201cinappropriate masculinity\u201d leveled at Worth; in Pierre Larousse\u2019s famed encyclopedia of the 19th century, he protested that fashion needed \u201cfairy-like fingers, not the build of an athlete, to be practiced properly and above all decently.\u201d By 1889, however, the tide had turned again: an edition of the \u201cPeterborough Express\u201d declared the name Worth \u201csynonymous with the center of the fashionable world\u201d. The \u201cLeitrim Advertiser,\u201d six years later, heralded his designs as \u201cdestined to revolutionize the world of feminine dress.\u201d The 20th century then saw a boom in couture houses modeled on Worth\u2019s example. While the likes of Chanel and Schiaparelli also made names for themselves, many of the biggest names were men, including Dior and Balmain in the 1940s and Givenchy in 1952. Neither this context nor women\u2019s relation to fashion is given much attention after Dietrich\u2019s diatribe, as the focus shifts increasingly to Lagerfeld and de Bascher\u2019s tumultuous relationship. \u201cBecoming Karl Lagerfeld\u201d is, stylistically, a luxurious tribute to \u201870s flair: gorgeous to look at and offering an aggressively humanized look at some of fashion\u2019s biggest names. But pulling harder at the thread of fashion\u2019s gendered power dynamics might have added a welcomed complexity.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/style/becoming-karl-lagerfeld-show/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "style_article_moshe-safdie-architect-singapore", "text": "There are few buildings that have more drastically shaped a city\u2019s image than Marina Bay Sands. Just as the Eiffel Tower and Burj Khalifa define the skylines of Paris and Dubai, the soaring three-tower resort, joined across the top by a horizontal \u201cskypark\u201d and the world\u2019s most famous infinity pool, is an icon both in and of Singapore. In fact, the hotel-casino project is so successful that the man who designed it doesn\u2019t even stay there. \u201cIt\u2019s too noisy,\u201d said Israeli-Canadian architect Moshe Safdie. \u201cI\u2019m a swimmer and I can never get in the pool because there are so many people taking pictures.\u201d Now resuming his once-frequent trips to Singapore amid easing travel restrictions, Safdie prefers the nearby Ritz-Carlton, where we meet for afternoon tea. (\u201cI had a British mother,\u201d he explained, \u201cso I\u2019m a sucker for scones and tea.\u201d) At a top-floor table overlooking his best-known creation, he reflected on the sometimes-fraught task of designing contemporary landmarks. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t on my mind as much as it was on their minds,\u201d he clarified, recounting the call for design proposals issued by the city-state\u2019s government in the mid-2000s. \u201cThey didn\u2019t quite say the building should become the icon of Singapore, but they talked about it being iconic.  \u201cWhen we made the submission, I said, \u2018Some buildings have the magic to become memorable and associated with a place.\u2019 And I mentioned Sydney Opera House as the classic contemporary example. But, I said, \u2018It\u2019s a mystery what makes that happen.\u2019\u201d The trick, it transpired, was designing something striking yet simple. Constructing a 0.2-mile-long cantilevered roof terrace atop three skyscrapers required a feat of complex engineering but, at its most abstract, Marina Bay Sands can be sketched in four basic strokes. In Singapore Sign Language, the landmark is referenced by simply raising three fingers of one hand and resting another digit across the top. Visible for miles around, it appears on postcards and newscast backdrops. The structure also stars in the official Singapore Lego set, which the architect proudly displays at his office back in Somerville, Massachusetts.  \u201cThat kind of stuff, you can\u2019t quite plan for or design \u2013 it just happens,\u201d he said of the building\u2019s success. \u201cBut I\u2019m very happy about it. It changed our lives in terms of the work we get.\u201d  Safdie\u2019s eponymous firm is in high demand. In the years since Marina Bay Sands opened in 2010, he has realized almost 20 major projects. Among them are the serene Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas and a dual-tower residential complex in Colombo, Sri Lanka, that sees one high-rise lean dramatically against the other. The architect also bequeathed Singapore with another landmark in 2019: Jewel, a nature-themed entertainment and retail complex that attracts throngs of Instagrammers to Changi Airport each day thanks to its verdant indoor waterfall.  Safdie has said he considers seeing finished projects in use to be among an architect\u2019s greatest pleasures. He makes a point of visiting Jewel whenever he\u2019s in Singapore. \u201cI was concerned about how the plants were doing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I was relieved to see they\u2019re thriving.\u201d The architect is not in Singapore to indulge in past glories, however. In the days after our interview, he will inspect two new developments: a gardenesque office complex in the island\u2019s west and a pair of residential towers on the upmarket Orchard Road. The latter features multiple skybridges \u2013 a recurring theme in Safdie\u2019s work that was recently taken to new extremes in Chongqing, China, where he lay a gargantuan \u201chorizontal skyscraper\u201d (containing an infinity pool, restaurants and an indoor garden) atop four 820-foot-tall towers.   Then there is the small matter of Marina Bay Sands\u2019 second phase. The expansion plans feature, among other things, a fourth tower \u2013 though Safdie dismissed early suggestions that his iconic skypark might be extended to rest across its top. In any case, Singapore officials have expressed that he shouldn\u2019t, in his words, \u201cscrew around\u201d with an icon. Instead, the new tower will stand apart from the other three, forming \u201csort of an exclamation mark,\u201d he explained, motioning punctuative strokes: \u201cBoooom\u2026 boom.\u201d  Radical vision  At 84, Safdie shows little sign of slowing down. Other recent trips have taken him to Sao Paolo, Brazil, where his glass-roofed Albert Einstein Education and Research Center recently opened its doors, and to the Ecuadorian capital Quito, where his tree-covered Qorner Tower will do so later this year. Covid-19 eased the architect\u2019s unrelenting travel schedule, but he used the downtime to pen a memoir, \u201cIf Walls Could Speak: My Life in Architecture.\u201d He said he felt it was \u201ctime to document things.\u201d  Published this week, \u201cIf Walls Could Speak\u201d serves as a reminder that much of Safdie\u2019s six-decade career has been dedicated to humbler pursuits \u2013 museums, memorials and social housing that reimagined how people might live in densely populated cities.  Before Marina Bay Sands, his best-known project was his very first: Habitat 67, a radical 1960s housing development that saw hundreds of identical prefabricated concrete units stacked into clusters along Montreal\u2019s Saint Lawrence River. Safdie\u2019s dream that it would spark a wave of large-scale \u201cHabitats\u201d around the world proved overly optimistic. His attempts to repeat the feat in other cities, including New York, Toronto and Iran\u2019s capital Tehran, have often been thwarted. Projects of such size require land, funding and political will, and Safdie\u2019s book openly recounts times when all three were lacking. But the principles underpinning the experiment \u2013 that apartment dwellers should enjoy access to outdoor space, views in multiple directions and the opportunity to interact with nature and neighbors \u2013 defined his work thereafter. Born in 1938 in Haifa, then part of British-controlled Palestine, Safdie has credited much of this architectural ethos to his childhood. As a boy, he always lived in apartment buildings, first in a Bauhaus-style block on Haifa\u2019s Mount Carmel and then at his family\u2019s new home further up the hill. At the latter, he would enter via a bridge, while the famous Baha\u2019i Gardens \u201calmost functioned as my backyard,\u201d he writes in \u201cIf Walls Could Speak.\u201d One need not look far for the inspiration behind the skybridges and elevated urban gardens that have since characterized his oeuvre. Safdie moved to Canada with his parents aged 15. (In a neat turn of events, he departed Israel via Lod Airport, since renamed Ben Gurion Airport, where decades later he would design a terminal building.) It was in Montreal that Safdie decided to pursue architecture \u2013 and where he first grew his signature mustache. He attended the city\u2019s McGill University and wrote a college thesis, \u201cA Case for City Living,\u201d outlining his vision for a flexible housing \u201csystem\u201d that could be adapted to different contexts and climates. Those early ideas have long shaped Safdie\u2019s outlook. They would shape his fortunes, too. After showing his college drawings to the influential modernist Louis Kahn, he secured an apprenticeship at the architect\u2019s Philadelphia office. Soon after, he was offered the chance to put his ideas into practice at a scale unimaginable to most young graduates.  Montreal was due to host the 1967 World Fair, or Expo 67. Despite having never completed a building, the then 24-year-old Safdie was asked by the event\u2019s mastermind (and his thesis adviser), architect Sandy van Ginkel, to develop a master plan for the site. He was also tasked with building on his ideas, eventually proposing a village-sized development of some 1,200 prefabricated dwellings stacked 20 to 30 stories high. His meticulous placement of each factory-built module was calculated to maximize garden space, allow in sunlight and improve residents\u2019 views. Interconnected pedestrian walkways and bridges lifted the urban realm above ground.  Political and financial realities scaled back his design; the final Habitat 67 comprised just 154 apartments \u2013 made from 354 modules and stacked 12 stories high across three \u201cclusters.\u201d It was, nonetheless, a major statement. In a postwar world rethinking how to accommodate rapidly urbanizing populations, Safdie\u2019s system of repeated modular forms offered a bold new model for housing. Three of the 20th century\u2019s most important architects, I.M. Pei, Paul Rudolph and Philip Johnson, toured the project together prior to its opening. Only when Johnson told Safdie that he had \u201coutdone\u201d the classical Italian architect Giovanni Battista Piranesi did he realize the project \u201cwas a game changer,\u201d he recounted. Habitat 67 was not universally adored. A New Yorker cartoon, which Safdie also displays at his Boston office, poked \u201cgentle fun\u201d at the project by depicting a spade-wielding child stacking sand into similar formations. Various journalists and fellow architects were more barbed in their criticisms.  \u201cIt\u2019s strange that something so radical done by a young person gets so much crap thrown at it,\u201d Safdie mused. \u201cBut that\u2019s been true of my career.\u201d   \u2018For everyone a garden\u2019  To define Safdie\u2019s career by either his breakout success or the \u201cmegascale\u201d projects of recent years would be to ignore much else in between.  In the early 1970s, he opened an office in Jerusalem, a city whose urban fabric he has profoundly transformed. As well as designing major institutions like the Hebrew Union College and the Yad Vashem Holocaust History Museum, he oversaw a full-scale rebuild of the destroyed Jewish Quarter and planned an entirely new city, Modi\u2019in-Maccabim-Re\u2019ut, about 15 miles to its northwest. At one point, he even considered running for mayor of Jerusalem. He has also built widely in North America, where his output spans from the meditative (a nondenominational chapel at the Harvard Business School) to the mammoth (Terminal 1 of Toronto\u2019s Pearson Airport). A citizen of Israel, the US and Canada, Safdie may be best known in the latter for the National Gallery in Ottawa, a grand glass palace housing some of the country\u2019s most treasured art.  Despite earlier setbacks Safdie has, more recently, found fertile ground for his \u201cHabitats\u201d in Asia. In 2017, he completed the first phase of the sprawling Habitat Qinhuangdao \u2013 in the titular city, about 200 miles from Beijing \u2013 a series of 16-story \u201cmini blocks\u201d connected by garden bridges. Back in Singapore, Safdie\u2019s pixelated Sky Habitat tower saw him stretch his familiar stacked forms high above the ground to maximize floor space on a comparatively small plot. In both cases \u2013 and throughout Safdie\u2019s career \u2013 ideals articulated in the 1960s have been adapted to meet the realities of new sites and clients. Yet, the architect maintains that his approach to housing remains, fundamentally, the same. \u201cThe belief in apartments being rethought as houses, in having gardens for every apartment, in quality of life, in streets and communities and making buildings that belong to their culture \u2013 from the outset these were fundamental to my beliefs,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they haven\u2019t changed. If anything, they have reinforced themselves as years go by.\u201d \u201cI think, without bragging, there\u2019s been consistency,\u201d he added. \u201cIn fact, you could say I\u2019ve not been dynamic enough, but I\u2019ve been pretty consistent.\u201d  Idealism and compromise   There were other high-profile proposals that never came to fruition. Among the most divisive was the Columbus Center, a pair of heavy-set towers once set to loom over Manhattan\u2019s Central Park at Columbus Circle before plans were scrapped following 1987\u2019s Wall Street crash (and amid vociferous criticism from the likes of Henry Kissinger and Jacqueline Onassis).  But Safdie\u2019s legacy will not be measured only by what was, or wasn\u2019t, built. Many of the once-radical ideas he championed are now mainstream \u2013 something he can take an amount of credit for. For one, his fixation on plant life, a principle he dubbed \u201cfor everyone a garden\u201d in a 1974 book of the same name, is now widely shared by younger architects. Urban gardens and \u201cliving walls\u201d are now almost de rigueur for new large-scale developments.  Plants do not always thrive, though. In his memoir, Safdie distinguishes between \u201csignificant plant life\u201d and \u201csorry shrubs.\u201d So-called biophilic architecture may now be all the rage, but it can be undone by insufficient planning or maintenance, leaving occupants with dying trees and even bug infestations. As such, Safdie welcomes the trend while cautioning again token gestures. \u201cThe idea of green buildings is a battle cry \u2013 everyone is for it,\u201d he said. Making them work, however, is another matter altogether. \u201cThere\u2019s a cynicism about so many architects presenting buildings that are fairly conventional and then, in the renderings, everything is green and every balcony is oozing with trees. When you look (closer), you see there\u2019s no preparation for the earth, there\u2019s no depth \u2013 it\u2019s a fantasy.\u201d Prefabrication, championed by the architect since his college thesis, is also enjoying a renaissance. Just two miles away from Marina Bay Sands, for instance, a Singaporean design firm is overseeing two 630-foot-tall residential skyscrapers built from units constructed in a factory over the border in Malaysia.  \u201cFor a long time, people totally gave up on (prefabrication),\u201d Safdie said. \u201cBut now there is a real shortage of labor and skilled labor \u2013 not in China, because they\u2019ve got an extraordinary workforce, and not in India, but everywhere else in Southeast Asia, in Singapore, in the West. So, anything that is labor-saving is now up for grabs.\u201d Much else has changed since Safdie formed his architectural ideals. For one, he \u201cnever would have imagined\u201d how densely populated cities would become in the past 50 years. \u201cPrograms change, lifestyles change, priorities change and technologies change,\u201d the architect added.  But what about him? Has his outlook changed, too? \u201cMy daughter accused me of not being as idealistic as I was,\u201d the architect said. \u201cI disagree with her.\u201d Safdie is nonetheless aware that the lofty principles of his youth may not be shared by the casinos or corporate clients he often works for. Being an architect sometimes means serving \u201cregimes you\u2019re not in love with and business entities whose values are different to yours,\u201d he noted.  \u201cTake the dilemma I had with Marina Bay Sands,\u201d he said, motioning once more toward the window and our view of the complex from the Ritz-Carlton\u2019s lounge. \u201cOn the one hand, the idea of doing a building that could promote \u2018gaming\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s a nice word for it, but \u2018gambling\u2019 is the reality \u2013 is almost immoral if you go there and see poor people with limited means wasting their money.  \u201cBut, to me, that was 2% or 3% of the area of a project that\u2026 could show what the public realm could be in a city. And that took over from the issue that nagged me.  \u201cThat\u2019s compromise,\u201d he concluded. \u201cBut the basic value, the idealism of the end product, has not diminished. Without it, I don\u2019t know how you can be an architect.\u201d \u201cIf Walls Could Speak: My Life in Architecture,\u201d published by Grove Atlantic, is available now.", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/article/moshe-safdie-architect-singapore/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}

Among the paintings saved was Danish artist Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s 1895 work \u201cFrom the Copenhagen Stock Exchange,\u201d the Chamber of Commerce said. Denmark\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, called the fire \u201cour own Notre Dame moment,\u201d referring to the blaze that destroyed the roof and spire of the Paris cathedral, five years ago almost to the day. The fire began at around 8.30 a.m. local time (2.30 a.m. ET), a Copenhagen fire department chief told CNN, and by 11 a.m. nearly half of the building had been destroyed. The fire was still burning by late afternoon. The Chamber of Commerce said it is \u201cat a loss for words for how great a tragedy this is.\u201d It said it was \u201ca sad day for our country\u201d and that \u201cthe damage will unfortunately be very expensive.\u201d \u201cWe have tried to rescue a lot of historic paintings that were inside the building and the historic furniture,\u201d Jakob Vedsted Andersen, an executive director at the Greater Copenhagen fire and rescue service, told CNN. He said it was \u201cway too soon\u201d to speculate about the causes of the blaze. Copenhagen police have told people to avoid the area and there have been no reported injuries so far. People were in the building when the fire started but they were all evacuated, said a police spokesperson who added that military personnel were at the scene to support fire-fighting efforts. A \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d is on fire, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said, calling the building\u2019s cultural heritage \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d The B\u00f8rsen building has been at the heart of Danish business since the 17th century. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt said 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he added in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Emergency services were working to control the fire but it had spread to all floors through the elevator shaft. Frank Trier Mikkelsen, operations manager at the Greater Copenhagen fire department, said the fire is burning \u201cviolently\u201d inside the building, according to TV 2, a government-owned TV channel. Forty firefighters were inside the building, with valuables being rescued, TV 2 reported. Mikkelsen told the Danish broadcaster that the fire is of a type that emergency managers dread, explaining parts of the building\u2019s roof need to be removed to extinguish it. He added machines have been called in to remove some of the copper roof, as the water just bounces off it.

{"id": "style_greg-girard-kowloon-walled-city-snap", "text": "It was the summer of 1989. Hong Kong\u2019s humidity \u2013 already oppressive \u2013 was intensified\u00a0in the dark, maze-like alleyways of an unruly enclave known as Kowloon Walled City. Then the most densely populated place on Earth, its buildings were packed together so tightly that barely a slither of sky was visible from the ground. Searching for a moment of respite from the heat and chaos below, photographer Greg Girard found himself on the roof of one of the enclave\u2019s many illegally-built high-rises among a tangled thicket of television antennas. He wasn\u2019t alone. In the Walled City, the delineation of private and public spaces \u201cwasn\u2019t always so clear,\u201d Girard recalled in a video call, adding that the roof was an escape for many of its residents to relax, do laundry or watch planes land at Kai Tak International Airport. \u201cOnce you get up to the rooftop, everything sort of changes. The vista opens up, and it\u2019s cooler, there\u2019s a breeze.\u201d Navigating the narrow gaps between buildings with planks of wood, children would skip and play between the webs of laundry lines and satellites.\u00a0\u201cNo one seemed to think of it as a dangerous place, even though there were no guardrails or anything like that,\u201d said Girard. On that particular summer day, some children spotted Girard\u2019s camera and approached him. When he turned the lens on them, they began performing and pulling faces. He snapped several shots, describing the final one, which he eventually chose to publish, as the moment when they had \u201csettled into this face-off with me.\u201d In the photograph a young girl, barefoot and wearing a blue dress, stares into the camera. Her face is relaxed and her hands are wrapped around an antenna pole as if she\u2019s about to swing. In the backdrop, her friend strikes a defiant stance, hands on her hips, while another is in the throes of messing around, bent double in a playful squat. \u201cI thought (the image) captured the kids\u2019\u00a0indifference to the potential danger \u2026 of the rooftop, while at the same time sort of owning their territory and confronting me while goofing around,\u201d said Girard, adding: \u201cIt was just quite an average day up on (there).\u201d The playfulness of the children, juxtaposed with the jagged antennas and stark concrete of their surroundings, seem to epitomized the spirit of Kowloon Walled City, the photographer said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an ideal playground but that never seemed to bother anyone \u2014 which was, of course, very much the spirit of the Walled City: making the best of, and even enjoying life in, a situation most other people would be horrified by.\u201d A \u2018strange, vertical village\u2019 Girard first visited Kowloon Walled City in 1986 while on a shoot at the nearby airport. At that time, around 350 buildings, up to 14 stories high, were packed precariously into a space of 0.01 square miles. Most of the towers were built without proper foundations or regard for safety codes. \u201cThis strange, vertical village wasn\u2019t really supposed to exist,\u201d said Girard, explaining the Kowloon Walled City was the product of a historical and political quirk. Although the enclave was situated in the middle of Hong Kong, then a British colony, imperial officials refused to take legal responsibility for it. As such, the Walled City remained technically subject to Chinese rule, though this was never enforced. \u201cThat allowed it to become something you couldn\u2019t have dreamed up,\u201d Girard added. Existing in ambiguity for nearly a century, it had a reputation for illicit dealings and was infamous for its triads, drug dens, brothels and unlicensed dentistry. But by the time the Canadian photographer made his first visit to the \u201cthriving\u201d city in 1986, triad control had waned and these characterizations were, he said, \u201cvery out of date.\u201d \u201cIt might have been true at one time,\u201d he added. But his enduring memory of the place was the community that lived there. \u201cYou quickly realize that it\u2019s just a place where folks are trying to get by, like any other working-class part of Hong Kong.\u201d Girard was determined to demystify the so-called \u201cCity of Darkness,\u201d particularly after the colonial government announced plans in 1987 to demolish it. He spent four years documenting the Walled City with fellow photographer Ian Lambot, with the pair eventually publishing a book of their images in 1999. Early on, Girard decided to photograph the series in color and used portable lighting equipment \u2014 similar to the kind he used to capture celebrities and CEOs for glossy magazine portraits. \u201cThe only pictures you saw of the Walled City at the time tended to be in black and white, and they made the place look as bad as possible, in keeping with the reputation of the Walled City as a dangerous, squalid slum,\u201d said Girard. When it came to capturing people\u2019s day-to-day lives, and images of residents, shopkeepers and factory owners, the photographer wanted to use \u201ca more even-handed approach,\u201d he added. Girard documented, among much else, the blurred chaos of noodle and fish ball factories, a young child inspecting his grazed knee on the counter of his family\u2019s grocery store, and a barber curling a client\u2019s hair. While initial reactions to his presence were often frosty (\u201cthere was a palpable unwelcomeness to outsiders,\u201d he recalled), residents eventually allowed him into their cramped apartments. His guiding principle, Girard said, was \u201cto try to show it for what it really was, since rumor and myths were the only things that were known about the place.\u201d Imagined dystopias When the Walled City was razed, from 1993 to 1994, that was supposed to be the end of it. But in the decades since, the enclave has arguably garnered more interest than it ever did while standing. In 2014, Girard and Lambot published a \u201crevisited\u201d edition of their book that explored the city\u2019s legacy in popular culture \u2014 including as an inspiration for fictional dystopias in video games and films, such as \u201cCall of Duty: Black Ops\u201d and \u201cBatman Begins.\u201d \u201cThe Walled City was this jumping-off point for an imaginary city where the normal rules don\u2019t apply,\u201d said Girard. There has been renewed interest in architectural circles, too: The unregulated, organic construction that made Kowloon Walled City a \u201cdystopia\u201d to live in is now being examined as a source of innovation due to its resourceful use of limited space and cheap or second-hand materials, said Girard. \u201cThe limitations of that place certainly spurred a lot of creative responses, in building terms, to (the question of) what to do in a place that no one cares about, or pays attention to, except the residents,\u201d Girard added. The site of the Walled City has since been transformed into a public park, which opened in 1995. Quiet and uncrowded, it is in many ways the opposite of what it replaced, providing a much-needed reprieve from the clamor of a city desperately short on public space. Open-air chess pavilions and banyan-shaded ponds surround the old yamen building, a relic of the 19th-century Chinese garrison city that once stood on the site and the only structure to survive the demolition. Inside the building, Girard\u2019s famous rooftop photo is blown-up to fill an entire wall, accompanied by an audio track of children laughing and the roar of airplane engines. The memory of a vibrant community \u2014 immortalized by photographers like Girard \u2014 lingers. Ongoing interest in the Walled City is, Girard suggests, because of the spirit it encapsulates: the aptitude for survival even in the harshest of circumstances. \u201cIt still continues to fascinate,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s wonderful.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/greg-girard-kowloon-walled-city-snap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_04_19_style_graham-sutherland-winston-churchill-portrait", "text": "\u201cThat is not a painting, it\u2019s a humiliation!\u201d Winston Churchill (played by John Lithgow) angrily tells the renowned painter Graham Sutherland (actor Stephen Dillane) in the first season of \u201cThe Crown,\u201d Netflix\u2019s six-series dramatization about the English monarchy. Churchill is talking about his own portrait, commissioned to celebrate his 80th birthday, as it is unveiled in London\u2019s Westminster Hall in November 1954. Churchill goes on to describe his appearance in the painting as \u201ca broken, sagging, pitiful creature,\u201d Sutherland as \u201ca Judas wielding his murderous brush,\u201d and concludes the whole work is \u201ca betrayal of friendship, and an unpatriotic, treacherous, cowardly assault by the individualistic left!\u201d The episode ends with Churchill\u2019s wife Clementine (played by Harriet Walter) watching it burn on a bonfire outside their home. Evidently, he was not a fan. While \u201cThe Crown\u201d is not a documentary, it is true that the 80th birthday portrait \u2014described by Churchill as \u201cfilthy and malignant\u201d in a letter to his personal doctor \u2014 was burned. \u201cI think he was quite vain about his image,\u201d Andre Zlattinger, Deputy Chairman UK and Head of Modern British & Irish Art at Sotheby\u2019s, explained during a press briefing. \u201cHe\u2019d had a stroke in 1953 so for him (how he was perceived) was important at that time. He\u2019d won the election in 1951 by a narrow margin, and there was quite a lot of debate about him and his leadership.\u201d While the painting itself was destroyed, a painted study of Churchill \u2014 created by Sutherland in preparation for the infamous birthday portrait \u2014 had been on display at the UK\u2019s Blenheim Palace in April, in the room where Churchill was born 150 years ago. Sutherland gave the study to his friend Alfred Hecht, who kept it for the rest of his life before gifting it to the current owner.\u00a0After its stint at the palace, it travelled to Sotheby\u2019s in New York and London ahead of it\u2019s first ever auction on June 6, where it fetched \u00a3660,000 ($842,490); lower than it\u2019s estimate of \u00a3800,000 ($1,024,000), but still the second highest price for a portrait of Churchill. \u201c(Sutherland) caught him in a much more relaxed, intimate way,\u201d Zlattinger said of the study, a small canvas painted in oils. \u201cIt\u2019s a very different depiction to the (later) painting which obviously Churchill didn\u2019t like and was later destroyed.\u201d Controlling the narrative Churchill was far from the only leader to micromanage his image, though; rulers have been controlling and falsifying their images for centuries. Sculptures of Ancient Egyptian pharaohs were stylized in ways to demonstrate their power. The female pharaoh Hatshepsut of the Eighteenth Dynasty diverted from reality completely by having herself depicted with a male torso. In the UK, Queen Elizabeth I is perhaps the most obvious example of a ruler distorting their image. Robert Blyth, Senior Curator of World and Maritime History at Royal Museums Greenwich, told CNN that after her 40s Elizabeth \u201csimply didn\u2019t age\u201d. In The Rainbow Portrait, one of her most famous paintings, any wrinkles a woman in her 60s might have had are carefully smoothed over. Queen Victoria, crowned more than 250 years after Elizabeth, also used painting to disguise her age, though the academic Ira B. Nadel wrote that her interest in photography eventually made her \u201cintolerant of idealized or inaccurate portraits.\u201d Blyth explains that, like Churchill, \u201ca touch of vanity\u201d drove monarchs\u2019 tightly controlled image; \u201cWho would want to have their portrait painted and look exactly as they do?\u201d, he joked.\u202fHowever, leaders also needed to provide political stability. Elizabeth I was \u201cthe end of the Tudor line\u201d, Blyth noted. \u201cThe idea of her image reflecting any frailty would have caused suspicion.\u201d Dr Caroline Rae, an associate lecturer in History of Art at University College London, agreed. \u201cIt was a period of big changes, people being beheaded,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cMortality is something which causes instability. (Elizabeth) knows things are maybe not as stable as one might think. She\u2019s in a precarious position.\u201d Altering public perceptions Churchill himself faced political precarity. An already tumultuous career landed him in Downing Street during the Second World War, but he was voted out almost as soon as it was over. He did become Prime Minister for a second time in 1951, but his Conservative Party only had a 17-seat majority and, in April 1955, six months after the birthday portrait debacle, Churchill resigned over ill health. \u201cThere was the Suez crisis happening, and Stalin had died in 1953, so there was a lot of stuff going on,\u201d Zlattinger said. \u201cHis health and political position at that time contributed to him being particularly controlling about how that portrait was created and perceived,\u201d Bryn Sayles, Head of Sale, Modern & Post-War British Art at Sotheby\u2019s, told CNN. \u201cBut even on earlier commissions, Churchill was quite famously a very tricky sitter and wanted to be depicted in a particular way. For instance, he made sculptor Jacob Epstein take out a bit of flab from underneath his chin (in a work), so from the beginning, Churchill understood the importance of his image as a politician and was very clear about how he felt that image should be presented to the public.\u201d Historic photographs of the UK\u2019s royal family were also regularly altered, however, not everyone was happy about it. Swiss historian Alexis Schwarzenbach reported that Queen Elizabeth, wife of King George VI and mother of Queen Elizabeth II, returned her 50th birthday photo to photographer Cecil Beaton in 1950, with instructions to reduce the amount of retouching done to her lips and chin. Just four years later, Churchill\u2019s very different reaction to his own \u2018imperfections\u2019 led to the scene now immortalized in \u201cThe Crown\u201d \u2014 a factor which Sayles explains has ironically piqued buyers\u2019 interests in owning his portraits. \u201cAfter \u201cThe Crown\u201d episode and Gary Oldman\u2019s portrayal of Churchill in the \u201cDarkest Hour\u201d movie, we literally had new collectors coming in the market looking for Churchill paintings because there was a renewed interest in him.\u201d While Churchill certainly would not have appreciated fresh attention on his hated portrait, buyers appetite for the study proves that the legacy of one of the UK\u2019s most famous leaders is far from over yet.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/19/style/graham-sutherland-winston-churchill-portrait/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_style_india-madras-fabric-us-fashion-intl-hnk", "text": "On the cover of Lisa Birnbach\u2019s \u201cThe Official Preppy Handbook,\u201d a tongue-in-cheek 1980s guide to looking, acting and thinking like a US prep school elite, a pattern along the border depicts a fabric that has become synonymous with casual American luxury: madras. The colorful plaid cotton cloth has been used by brands like Ralph Lauren and Brooks Brothers for decades. Think light summer dresses, shirts and shorts worn at the country club or on sailing holidays in the Bahamas \u2014 the kind of attire that might be complemented by a pair of leather boat shoes. But this staple of preppy American fashion has humble origins, far from Martha\u2019s Vineyard or the hallways of Yale or Harvard, in Chennai, India, the coastal city from which it takes its name. (Chennai was known as Madras during British rule.) Originally worn by Indian laborers, the cloth almost sparked a corporate scandal for American textile importer William Jacobson in 1958 due to its tendency to bleed when cleaned with strong detergent in high-powered washing machines. \u201cThe fascinating thing was that with every wash, the colors bled into each other. And they didn\u2019t do it badly. They bled in a very \u2018design\u2019 kind of way,\u201d said Bachi Karkaria, author of \u201cCapture the Dream: The Many Lives of Captain C.P. Krishnan Nair,\u201d a biography of the Indian textile magnate and hotelier who first sold Jacobson the madras, in a video interview with CNN. \u201cThis is what absolutely attracted Jacobson.\u201d In her book, Karkaria tells the story of Jacobson and Nair\u2019s meeting \u2014 Nair rattling off the unique selling points of the fabric, which was woven using lightweight 60-count yarn for the warp (thread held in place on the loom) and slightly heavier 40-count yarn for the weft (thread woven horizontally through the warp) before being dyed. The natural dyes were made from laterites, indigo blue, turmeric and local sesame seed oil, all of which gave the cloth a distinctive scent. Madras was, by the 1950s, already a hit in West Africa where it was used to make flamboyant gowns for weddings and other celebrations. A unique selling point But the most exciting quality Nair pitched to Jacobson, Karkaria said, was the fabric\u2019s weakness-as-strength \u2014 it would bleed with every wash, creating a new kind of check and a \u201cnew\u201d garment. The pair struck a dollar-a-yard deal (about $10 per yard in today\u2019s money), with an immediate shipment of 10,000 yards that was entirely scooped up by Brooks Brothers and tailored into sporty jackets, shirts and shorts. \u201cLaidback post\u2013World War II baby boomers couldn\u2019t have enough,\u2019\u201d she wrote, noting that shelves with madras clothing were stripped within a week. But, in his excitement, Jacobson forgot to tell Brooks Brothers the fabric would bleed, the author said. When the label failed to provide buyers with proper care instructions, complaints and lawsuits started rolling in. \u201cAll hell broke loose because customers found that their colors would \u2018bleed\u2019 not only into the fabric\u2019s own checks but also run into the other clothes which were unwittingly washed along with them,\u201d wrote Karkaria. One of New York\u2019s original \u201cMad Men\u201d was called in to salvage the situation \u2014 British advertising tycoon David Ogilvy, who ended up coining the tagline \u201cGuaranteed to Bleed,\u201d spinning the apparent flaw into a unique selling point. The publicity drive continued with an eight-page advertorial in Seventeen magazine on the \u201cmiracle handwoven fabric from India,\u201d featuring an interview with Nair. \u201cNaturally, all the other pr\u00eat labels cottoned on, and made it part of their summer collections,\u201d wrote Karkaria. From the brink of a PR disaster, Ogilvy had helped turn madras garments into must-haves for America\u2019s well-heeled jet-set. Yale links and the making of an icon Although Ogilvy, Nair and Jacobson shot madras into superstardom in the US during the 1960s, the fabric\u2019s link with the Ivy League had started centuries earlier with Elihu Yale, the colonial administrator of the East India Company\u2019s Fort St. George outpost in Chennai and the primary benefactor of Yale College (now Yale University). A 1961 advertisement, created by Ogilvy for the American men\u2019s shirt brand Hathaway, claims that the university was founded thanks to \u201cthree trunks of India Madras\u201d donated by Yale. Yale, who amassed much of his fortune through the East India Company in the late 17th century, sent \u201cunusual cotton fabrics that the Indian cottagers made\u201d to be sold or \u201cotherwise improved\u201d to benefit the college, the ad reads. \u201cThe handsome stuff brought enough money to finish the buildings for the new college, which grateful trustees promptly named after Eli Yale,\u201d continues the ad, which may have employed some creative license, given it\u00a0says it chose its name after Yale donated \u201cthe proceeds from the sale of nine bales of goods together with 417 books and a portrait of King George I.\u201d Yale himself is a controversial figure. He built his fortune off the exploitative diamond and textile trades, and while his namesake university says there is \u201cno direct evidence\u201d that he \u201cpersonally owned slaves,\u201d he stands accused of trading and profiting from them. But Yale\u2019s fabric donation wasn\u2019t the only reason why madras became synonymous with American prep. The fabric already had a long history by the time Yale chanced upon it. Some say it was inspired by Scottish tartans, though it differs in several important ways (madras features neither the black lines nor the two-by-two weave of tartan, and is made of cotton, not wool). Records seen by Metropolitan Museum of Art researcher Kai Toussaint Marcel show that Portuguese merchants traded the Indian fabric in North Africa and the Middle East as far back as the 13th century, and that the Kalabari people of Nigeria used it in dresses and headdresses and during religious and spiritual rituals. Marcel, writing for the Tommy Hillfiger-backed \u201cFashion and Race Database, a project founded by Parsons School of Design professor Kimberly M. Jenkins, added that West African slaves brought to America likely kept these traditions, and the fabric, alive. From Chennai to shores of the Caribbean Fort St. George was established in the 1630s, helping the British cement a monopoly on the highly lucrative Indian textile industry. Later, the Dutch and French would also trade cotton and madras alongside enslaved Africans, bringing the fabric aboard slave ships to the West Indies. In the 18th century, a protectionist move to support domestic textile producers saw England and France ban madras from being sold in their countries, only allowing it to be traded in the Caribbean colonies. Research by the London School of Economics estimates that Indian cotton textiles, which were often exchanged for slaves, accounted for 30% of the total export value of 18th century Anglo-African trade. From there, madras \u201cbecame a staple for both free and enslaved Black people,\u201d especially women, who \u201cused brightly-colored madras headdresses to subvert the sumptuary laws (that limited private expenditure on food and personal items) of the Caribbean and New Orleans\u2026 which mandated plainness as a sign of inferiority,\u201d writes Marcel. And it was there, on the sunny shores of the Caribbean, that the cloth became an inseparable part of the prep wardrobe thanks to tourism and Ivy League rugby tournaments in the mid-1930s. Students from East Coast schools like Yale and Princeton would travel to Bermuda to play rugby and \u201csunbathe, splash in the surf, play in volleyball tournaments and elect a new Miss College Week,\u201d Sports Illustrated reported in 1956. They would also \u201cthrong\u201d local stores to \u201cbuy devalued-pound bargains in cashmere and Shetland sweaters, madras Bermuda shorts and blazers,\u201d the article added. As a result, Marcel wrote, madras became \u201cassociated with Ivy League schools, vacation, the Caribbean, and eventually domestic locales such as Long Island (the Hamptons), Rhode Island (Newport), and South Florida (Palm Beach and Fisher Island). \u201cThe fabric was fashioned into everything from shirts, (pants), shorts, and blazers, to watchbands, ties, and other accessories.\u201d Nowadays the fabric is a little less ubiquitous, with the \u201cquiet luxury\u201d trend nudging brands toward a more toned-down aesthetic. And even the cover of Birnbach\u2019s updated guide to the preppy lifestyle, \u201cTrue Prep: It\u2019s a Whole New Old World,\u201d has replaced its madras border with another \u2014 though no less colorful \u2014 pattern: stripes.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/style/india-madras-fabric-us-fashion-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}

In response, a number of current state titleholders who competed alongside Voigt for Miss USA \u2014 including Miss North Carolina USA 2023 Jordyn Ashlee McKey, Miss Wisconsin USA 2023 Alexis Loomans and Miss New York USA, Rachelle di Stasio \u2014 shared social media messages in support of Voigt, asking the organization to \u201crelease Noelia from the confidentiality NDA clause of her contract, in perpetuity, so that she is free to speak on her experiences and time as Miss USA.\u201d Denise White, a PR representative for both Srivastava and Voigt \u2014 and the 1994 Miss Oregon USA \u2014 alleged that both winners are restricted by \u201cironclad\u201d non-disclosure agreements in their contracts. To date, neither Voigt or Srivastava has publicly revealed more about what led them to quit. But in a resignation letter provided to the Miss USA organization and obtained by CNN, Voigt outlined a number of concerns, ranging from frustrating managerial issues to more serious allegations. In it, she described a \u201ctoxic work environment\u201d that \u201cat best, is poor management and, at worst, is bullying and harassment.\u201d She accused the pageant\u2019s CEO, Laylah Rose, of \u201cslandering\u201d her character in conversations with people inside and outside of the organization, including calling Voigt \u201cmentally ill.\u201d Rose is an entrepreneur and CEO of the VIP Pageantry Network, who took over the brand in 2023. Voigt says Rose\u2019s communications to her were \u201ccold and unnecessarily aggressive,\u201d and that she never received a formal meeting about her responsibilities. Despite the lack of communication about her role, she was \u201cconstantly\u2026 threatened with disciplinary action, including taking away my salary,\u201d according to the document. The organization failed to arrange travel accommodations for Voigt on multiple occasions, she wrote, and did not provide her with an apartment and car for months, as had been outlined in her prize package. Nor did she have an \u201ceffective handler,\u201d she claimed, the latter leading to an instance where Voigt says she was sexually harassed during a Christmas parade event in Sarasota, Florida, while alone with an unnamed person in a car. According to Voigt\u2019s letter, Rose is \u201cactively building a culture of fear and control, the antithesis of women\u2019s empowerment, that is\u2026unsafe for future titleholders and employees.\u201d Nor, she wrote, can she publicly voice her concerns, saying she is \u201csilenced contractually from being able to speak up for myself.\u201d \u2018Things are falling apart\u2019 Voigt and Srivastava\u2019s respective resignations were not coordinated, according to White. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve witnessed and seen is harassment, a toxic work environment and bullying,\u201d White said in a telephone interview with CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s just not conducive to a women\u2019s organization that uplifts women and is supposed to promote using your voice. It\u2019s quite the opposite.\u201d Both pageant winners sought out support from management at Miss Universe, which owns the Miss USA organization, without success, she added. \u201cBoth young ladies were always trying to resolve any issues quietly behind the scenes,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe fact that Miss Universe Organization has not even responded to Noelia\u2019s resignation at this point is just stonewalling\u2026 No wonder things are falling apart. Because nobody knows what to do.\u201d The Miss Universe organization and Rose, through Miss USA, did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Voigt\u2019s pageant coach, Thom Brodeur, who has worked with Miss USA contestants since 1991 and began working with Voigt while she was preparing for Miss Utah, emphasized new and ominous territory for the organization under Rose. \u201cNo woman has ever resigned as Miss USA or as Miss Teen USA, and she\u2019s lost both of them in 48 hours,\u201d he said. Even before Voigt and Srivastava stepped down, there was turmoil in the organization, according to White, Brodeur and Miss USA\u2019s former social media director, Claudia Engelhardt, who also resigned in recent days. Engelhardt claimed on Instagram that she had worked without pay for two months after being hired, and that she had seen a \u201cdecline\u201d in Voigt\u2019s mental health, and witnessed \u201cdisrespect\u201d toward Srivastava and members of her family. And according to Engelhardt, they were far from the only members of the Miss USA organization to depart. When she began her role in January, she was part of an already small team of five employees. Now, she says, after multiple firings and resignations, the team is down to Rose and one other employee. Multiple sources said the turnover has been constant. \u201cThis is not a state pageant. This is not a local pageant. You need\u2026 a whole team,\u201d Engelhardt said in a phone call with CNN. Engelhardt said she believed she was applying for a freelance role, and was surprised to find she was being hired as staff. Still, she claimed, she received no employee contract, no onboarding and no guidance. There was no one else to help her manage the day-to-day social media needs of the national brand, she said, and often came up against what she framed as Rose\u2019s overbearing approach to their social accounts. \u201cShe would block Instagram accounts with people that she had personal discrepancies with. She would censor comments, and she would leave comments for the Miss USA page as if she was Noelia,\u201d Engelhardt claimed. White also alleged that Rose impersonated the two pageant winners on their official accounts. Weeks before Voigt resigned, she announced in a now-deleted Instagram post on her personal account that she \u201cno longer had access\u201d to her Miss USA pages. An uneasy path forward Engelhardt said she witnessed firsthand the impact of the role on Voigt, who she considers a friend as well as a former colleague. \u201c(I saw) how stressed out she would get when the owner would constantly bombard her with emails,\u201d she recalled. \u201cShe was constantly living in an anxious state.\u201d But despite the day-to-day stressors, Voigt alleged that she only made few public appearances. She said in her letter that, aside from a handful of press interviews in Los Angeles following her win and subsequent ones in Utah, the state she had represented at the Miss USA pageant, she had \u201cyet to make an appearance outside of Sarasota, Florida,\u201d where she was living. This was due to a \u201clack of communication\u201d that she found \u201cbaffling,\u201d she wrote. \u201cOur Miss USA, who should have been booked and busy (with) endless opportunities was sitting around doing nothing, and it\u2019s not because she didn\u2019t want to, but because of mismanagement,\u201d Engelhardt said. On May 9, the Miss USA pageant announced that Savannah Gankiewicz, Miss Hawaii USA 2023 and first-runner up to Voigt at the 2023 Miss USA pageant, would be taking over the national title and its responsibilities. She will be officially crowned on May 15. \u201cWe are proud to crown Savannah Miss USA 2023, A true representation of vision, intelligence, and compassion,\u201d Rose said in a statement. \u201cHer dedication to empowering women through self-love and confidence is inspiring, and we look forward to her impactful reign as Miss USA.\u201d \u201cI fully support and respect Noelia\u2019s decision to step down, and I stand in solidarity with mental health awareness,\u201d Gankiewicz\u00a0added. \u201cTo my fellow Miss USA sisters, I believe it\u2019s crucial for us to stand united for the future of the organization and the incoming class of 2024 and beyond.\u201d Though many have offered their public support for the two resigned pageant winners \u2014 including\u00a0Shanna Moakler, who oversaw Voigt\u2019s win in her role as the state director for the Miss Utah USA pageant, and Cindy Provost and Debbie Miller, who oversaw Srivastava\u2019s win in their role as state directors for the Miss New Jersey Teen USA pageant \u2014 Engelhardt and White both hope that others will step up to reveal more about what they see as a stifling culture, as well as potential legal ramifications, that are keeping the titleholders quiet. \u201cThey need somebody else to speak up for them,\u201d White said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/style/miss-usa-pageant-organization-allegations/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_04_29_style_dodecahedron-roman-object-mystery-scn-scli-intl", "text": "Amateur archaeologists in England have unearthed one of the largest Roman dodecahedrons ever found, but mystery surrounds what it was actually used for. The 12-sided object is one of just 33 known to exist in Roman Britain, and one of approximately 130 in the world. It is considered \u201cone of archaeology\u2019s great enigmas,\u201d according to the Norton Disney History and Archaeology Group, an amateur group based in the English region of Lincolnshire where it was found in June. Measuring about 8 centimeters (3 inches) across, the dodecahedron is hollow and covered with 12 holes of varying sizes. The 1,700-year-old object will be displayed at the Lincoln Museum from May 4 until early September. \u201cIt\u2019s a real pleasure to have the Norton Disney dodecahedron joining us\u2026 just a stone\u2019s throw from where it was found,\u201d Andrea Martin, exhibitions and interpretations manager at the museum, said in a Lincolnshire County Council press release. \u201cTo have the opening of the display coincide with the Lincoln Festival of History is a real coup.\u201d The release describes the dodecahedron as \u201cone of the largest examples\u201d discovered. However, experts still aren\u2019t sure exactly what the Romans used the dodecahedron for. \u201cIt is completely unique,\u201d said Richard Parker, secretary of the Norton Disney History and Archaeology Group, adding that no similar objects have ever been found. He said that, unlike other dodecahedra, this one is undamaged. \u201cOurs is absolutely in a fabulous condition. It\u2019s complete, undamaged, and it clearly was considered of great value by whoever made it and by those that used it,\u201d Parker said. \u201cSo there must have been a very important reason for it to be deposited in the ground in the way that it was.\u201d Parker told CNN there are no descriptions of the dodecahedron in Roman literature, and they have not been depicted pictorially in mosaics. There are also several features that make it difficult to discern what its intended purpose was. All of the dodecahedra are of different sizes, meaning they were not used for measurement, he said. Because it is undamaged with no signs of wear, it is unlikely to have been a tool, Parker added. Parker\u2019s group does have one working theory, however. \u201cMost likely they were some form of religious or ritual object,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Romans were a very superstitious lot, and generally required signs to allow them to make decisions in their daily lives.\u201d One indication supporting that idea is that the object was found near a small Roman mounted rider god figurine with \u201cstrong religious connections,\u201d Parker said. The artifact was discovered in 1989 by metal detectorists, and the figurine is \u201coften found on temple sites.\u201d The organization plans to return to the dig site later this year to conduct further excavations, which Parker hopes will help establish context on how the area was used. Parker said he is optimistic that the mystery will be solved because this dodecahedron was found in an archaeological excavation area, whereas \u201cmany of those that were found 200 or 300 years ago had no context to where they were found.\u201d \u201cIt is quite a complex story to tell that we\u2019re just starting to tease out,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/29/style/dodecahedron-roman-object-mystery-scn-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2023_07_03_style_felipe-romero-beltran-dialect-spain-migration", "text": "Photographer Felipe Romero Beltr\u00e1n\u2019s depiction of a migrant facility in Spain oozes with the boredom and malaise of life in legal limbo. His young subjects are seen smoking cigarettes, lifting weights and trimming one another\u2019s hair. Other images show them hanging out in a grubby yard or lying around on mattresses. The photos were shot with the help of nine young Moroccans whom Beltr\u00e1n befriended in Seville, capital of the southern region of Andaluc\u00eda. Published in his new book \u201cDialect,\u201d the pictures were initially intended to be personal, not political. But they ultimately spoke to what Beltr\u00e1n called a \u201cKafka-esque\u201d system in which the men waited for years to learn whether their residency applications would be approved. \u201cAt the beginning, it was just about this group of guys,\u201d Beltr\u00e1n said on a video call from Madrid. \u201cBut of course, I realized that I was photographing these really specific political bodies, or political subjects in this bureaucracy.\u201d Last year, nearly 30,000 migrants arrived in Spain by sea, down from a record of over 58,000 in 2018, according to UNHCR data. Of these, most arrived in the Canary Islands or Andaluc\u00eda, a region separated from Morocco by the Strait of Gibraltar, a stretch of water just 13 kilometers (eight miles) at its narrowest. The nine men, who didn\u2019t previously know one another, were among those to arrive by boat during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic in search of a better life. Recounting his journey with an essay in \u201cDialect,\u201d one of Beltr\u00e1n\u2019s subjects, Youssef Elhafidi, recalls another terrified teen migrant being forced by smugglers to pilot their boat. \u201cHe did not want to drive, the fear was paralyzing him, they took out a knife and put it on his neck, threatening him to start the engines,\u201d Elhafidi wrote. \u201cThe boy started the machine between trembling and crying and we headed north.\u201d Killing time According to Beltr\u00e1n, his nine subjects were required to stay in Spain for three continuous years before applying for residency. Undocumented and without the right to work during this time, they were dependent on the state for food and housing. While living at the government-run facility, the men took Spanish lessons and joined workshops to help them adapt to life in Spain \u2014 some of which were run by Beltr\u00e1n. Overcoming an initial language barrier, the photographer began working with the group to produce images and videos. As well as candid portraits, the pictures focus on conditions at the facility, from peeling walls to basic food supplies. Many of the images were, however, staged. As Beltr\u00e1n looked for different ways to engage with his subjects, he asked them to re-enact moments from their respective migration journeys. In one, a subject lies motionless on blue gym mats, just as he had upon landing on Spain\u2019s coast. Another shows two of the men carrying a third on their shoulders to recreate the moment he fainted during a day-long walk to Seville from a small town to its south. The resulting book is thus part documentary and part performance, with Beltr\u00e1n toeing the line between mentor and collaborator, photographer and choreographer. More than just an artistic decision, staging photos directly responded to the tedium of the migrants\u2019 abundant free time. \u201cThere was an activity around taking the images \u2014 it was something during the day that (could get them) excited. And it was fun,\u201d Beltr\u00e1n recalled. \u201cEveryone was laughing, and they just make jokes each other during the sessions.\u201d Lost in translation When Beltr\u00e1n began delivering workshops at the facility in 2020, he was all too familiar with the system his subjects were trapped in. A few years earlier, he had relocated to Spain from his native Colombia, and \u2014 even as a college-educated Spanish speaker \u2014 also struggled to navigate the complex immigration processes. To illustrate the challenge facing his francophone subjects, his project included a video titled \u201cRecital\u201d in which they attempted to read the first four pages of the Spanish immigration law that would determine their futures. \u201cThey weren\u2019t understanding a word,\u201d he recalled, noting that, although lawyers were assigned to act on the men\u2019s behalf, the language barrier and dense legalese removed their agency. The opening pages of \u201cDialect\u201d \u2014 whose title alludes to these very linguistical challenges \u2014 are dedicated to stills from the video. Pictures of the men struggling to comprehend the legislation are overlaid with technical terminology (\u201cRight to effective judicial protection\u201d reads the text on one frame; another says, \u201cAuthorizations for the purpose of carrying out profit-making activities\u201d). \u201cThese legal procedures are really, really complicated, even for native speakers,\u201d said Beltr\u00e1n, who is now completing a PhD program in photography in Madrid. \u201cIt becomes almost like translation work \u2014 translating these laws and bureaucracies into (something understandable to) normal people like us.\u201d The result, he said, is an inevitable sense of helplessness. \u201cYou can\u2019t talk with anyone,\u201d Beltr\u00e1n added. \u201cYou can\u2019t ask, \u2018Who is the law?\u2019 or \u2018Who is the state?\u2019 You don\u2019t have anyone to approach. You don\u2019t have any tools to make a living\u2026 The system is built to avoid you, or to deny you access to (it).\u201d Describing the group as \u201cjust young people trying to figure out what to do with life,\u201d the photographer hopes his project can humanize migrants\u2019 experiences in a world increasingly desensitized to images of their suffering. Since Beltr\u00e1n completed his project, most of his subjects have completed their three-year wait and now formally reside in Spain, he says. He remains in touch with some \u2014 including Elhafidi, who he says works in a restaurant and has accompanied him at promotional events for the book\u2019s launch. In the conclusion of his essay, Elhafidi recalled how he felt when he secured his residency, writing: \u201cIt took me three years of searching and putting courage to life, until finally the moment came, after being cold, scared, hungry and the most difficult thing, my mother\u2019s tears\u2026 I got it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI got the papers. Now after getting it I have another look at life, I finally feel that I have the opportunity to be whoever I want to be.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re building their lives,\u201d Beltr\u00e1n said of those, including Elhafidi, who have secured residency. \u201cFortunately, they now can go back to Morocco to visit and see their families.\u201d \u201cDialect,\u201d published by Loose Joints, is available now.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/07/03/style/felipe-romero-beltran-dialect-spain-migration/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_style_helicopter-photographer-donn-delson", "text": "\u201cThis is not daredevil stuff,\u201d says 75-year-old fine art photographer Donn Delson as we sit in a helicopter with no door, almost 2,000 feet above London. At this height, the winds are numbing even in May, yet Delson, on the outermost seat, dangles his legs out as a diminutive Big Ben and Tower Bridge pass by beneath us. \u201cOn a good day I\u2019ll go out on the (skid),\u201d he says rather nonchalantly, referring to the two nail-bitingly thin helicopter landing bars beneath us. \u201cBut harnessed up, of course, and only when we\u2019re hovering.\u201d While many may turn green at the thought of hanging out of a door-less helicopter, this is the desired set up for Delson \u2014 who refuses to put his camera lens anywhere near a window. \u201cIt\u2019s really the only way I want to shoot,\u201d he said, back on the ground the following day, of his penchant for working at height. \u201cI do everything on a large scale, because I want people to get the feeling I have when I\u2019m up there.\u201d The feeling, as it appeared sitting next to Delson in that same sky-high \u2018copter, is one of complete calmness. Mid-flight, he grumbles at the fierce winds and asks the pilot to slow the aircraft down to a hover. Suddenly we\u2019re suspended \u2014 wobbling in the air somewhere above the river Thames (a designated heli-lane intended to spare the rest of the city in the event of a crash) as Delson reaches under his headset to remove the black cap worn backwards on his head. \u201cMuch better,\u201d he says, and gives the signal to fly on. Delson, who is based in Los Angeles, began his career as an aerial photographer almost a decade ago. He\u2019s since spent over 300 hours in a helicopter, capturing everything from the ephemeral cherry blossoms of Japan to rugged mountain trails hidden in the Red Sea \u2014 sometimes from as high as 12,000 feet. His preference to charter private helicopters, which costs him between $800 and $2,500 per hour, is made possible by the fact that this is his 9th career. \u201cI\u2019ve been fortunate to have been an entrepreneur most of my life, and be successful in my business activities,\u201d Delson told CNN. After selling his last company BandMerch \u2014 one of the largest entertainment merchandise businesses in the world with Rihanna, Outkast and Billy Joel as his clientele \u2014 Delson was able to retire, briefly, before a chance holiday excursion set him on a new path. \u201cWe were on a trip to New Zealand, and my wife and I had the opportunity to go up in a helicopter to see a glacier,\u201d he said. The pilot, noticing a hefty camera strapped around Delson, offered to open the door in order to let him shoot out unencumbered. \u201cMy wife said no. I said, \u2018Sounds fabulous.\u2019\u201d There\u2019s an uncanniness to looking down at the world from above. The usual markers of your street-level experience have vanished, as has everyone else in the world. It\u2019s quiet and still. If there wasn\u2019t the looming anxiety of a potential helicopter malfunction, it might even be peaceful. Delson\u2019s work leans into this strange, disembodied feeling by capturing scenes that trick the eye. A parking lot filled with cargo containers that look like musical bars on a xylophone; or the Red Sea\u2019s sprawling canyons and gullies that could be the branches of an ancient tree. \u201cThe French term trompe l\u2019oeil was used by painters whose paintings were so lifelike you\u2019d think it\u2019s a picture. I want to make audiences rethink assumptions about what they\u2019re seeing.\u201d There\u2019s no guarantee Delson will get one of these illusionary shots, however. In Japan, the photographer spent between 20 and 25 hours in the air over the course of a week \u2014 in Israel, he flew for a combined 36 hours. But sometimes he won\u2019t take a single picture. \u201cIt\u2019s a risk,\u201d Delson said. \u201cI have no idea when I go up whether or not I\u2019m going to find anything.\u201d Even if he returns empty-handed, Delson believes there is more to be gained from the experience than simply making new work. \u201cI\u2019m definitely different than before I started flying,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cI\u2019ve always considered myself to be a fairly spiritual person, but the perspective that one gets when you have the opportunity to do these things is transformative.\u201d Journeying back to the office at ground level, London seems a lot smaller. Just a few hours before, the capital was an intimidating, sprawling metropolis home to almost 9 million people. Now it feels almost bijou. The London Eye, what I considered to be the vertiginous pinnacle of the city at 10 years old, now feels laughably miniature; nothing more than a hamster wheel.\u00a0 Even Canary Wharf struggles to seem as imposing once you\u2019ve seen 50-storey landmark One Canada Square from 1,200 feet, shrunken to the size of a Lego brick. \u201cThe world from above, it\u2019s just so different from the world we know,\u201d said Delson. For any newcomers or tourists, struggling with the numerous skyscrapers, boroughs, tube lines or zone demarcations \u2014 try stepping into a helicopter. The result is a city that feels much more manageable.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/style/helicopter-photographer-donn-delson/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_27_style_lilly-pulitzer-rebrand-fashion-resort", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 A decade ago, Lilly Pulitzer\u2019s bright prints were omnipresent on college campuses across the US, and a pop-up for its 2015 collaboration with Target in New York\u2019s Bryant Park drew crowds of Millennial shoppers at the height of their modern preppy obsession. That same year, sales grew 22 percent. Fashion has since moved on from that aesthetic, but Lilly Pulitzer hasn\u2019t: In an era of quiet luxury, affordable facsimiles of the loud colors and patterns favored by the wealthy denizens of Palm Beach, Florida, where the brand was founded 65 years ago, look out of place. Sales reflect that stagnation, growing 1 percent last year to $343.5 million. Looking to usher in the brand\u2019s next era, earlier this month Lilly Pulitzer unveiled a new logo that retains its signature bright pink hue \u2014 but now with a typeface that looks straight out of the 1950s, the decade the brand was founded. Connecting with a new generation will take more than a new font, however. Gen-Z tastes reign supreme now, and they have a very different idea of what preppy looks like. Rather than shift dresses, they\u2019re big on neutral oversized blazers and baggy jeans. Rather than fully capitulate to Gen Z\u2019s tastes, Lilly Pulitzer is targeting customers who \u201clove the brand that maybe hadn\u2019t shopped in a while,\u201d said the brand\u2019s chief executive Michelle Kelly. That includes occasion wear, where bright and bold still flies even in today\u2019s quiet luxury moment. In March, it released a collaboration with Badgley Mischka, with pieces running from $400 to $700, versus a $100 to $300 standard price point. \u201cThere are definitely moments in the culture where trends are going to be in our favor or less,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cOur approach\u2026 is to do what we do. That balance of staying grounded to who we are, but being aware of changes.\u201d The cultural tides may also be turning in Lilly Pulitzer\u2019s favor once again. Palm Beach has been on the rise as a fashion destination in recent years, with brands including Hill House Home, Nili Lotan and MyTheresa hosting events and opening stores there. Plus, 1960s Palm Beach style has been in the spotlight this spring on Apple TV\u2019s series \u201cPalm Royale.\u201d More than that, it\u2019s a brand that plenty of women \u2014 from those who were contemporaries of Pulitzer herself to their granddaughters who are sharing their Lilly hauls on TikTok \u2014 have a soft spot for. \u201cLilly is one of the few brands that customers of all ages can come to an event, shop and not be alarmed that someone three decades older or younger is shopping,\u201d said Kelly. \u201cIt\u2019s just really special that all ages can have an affinity (for the brand).\u201d Lilly\u2019s new look Founded in 1959, the brand was born out of a conundrum faced by its eponymous founder: Palm Beach residents Pulitzer and her husband owned several orange groves, and Pulitzer operated a juice stand. Constantly finding juice stains on her clothes, she asked her dressmaker to make a dress with colors bright enough to hide the marks. They were so popular she began selling them at the juice stand, too. By the 1960s, they had become something of an icon of American apparel, and were particularly a favorite among well-heeled women including Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and socialite Wendy Vanderbilt. In 2010, the company was acquired by Oxford Industries, which also owns Tommy Bahama and Johnny Was, among other brands, and is now headquartered in Philadelphia. But it maintains firm roots in Palm Beach. \u201cNothing is more rooted in a resort Americana aesthetic than Lilly Pulitzer,\u201d said Robert Burke, chief executive of retail consultancy Robert Burke Associates. \u201cIt\u2019s always stayed very grounded in that Palm Beach mentality.\u201d Kelly sees the brand\u2019s history as an advantage in connecting with a younger audience. \u201cGen-Z wants that authenticity, and we have an authentic brand story that we lean into, and that I think differentiates us in the crowded market right now,\u201d she said. Still, she\u2019s aware that the brand needs to push forward as well as look to the past. The logo switch up is just one element in a \u201cjourney of brand refreshment\u201d that Lilly is currently undergoing, Kelly said. The goal, she added, is to strike the right balance between honoring the brand\u2019s history \u2014 and its loyal customers \u2014 while pushing it forward enough that it resonates with young consumers. \u201cWe just saw the opportunity to have our visual identity and our overall branding fit our needs a bit better,\u201d she said. The new logo, created by designer Robin Kramer, she said felt like a \u201cgreat balance of look backward, but a huge step forward\u201d with a more modern take on a retro-inspired typeface. As well, the brand is popping up in new spaces. Collaborations have long been a part of the brand\u2019s strategy; since Target, it inked a partnership with Pottery Barn that\u2019s still ongoing. This year, in addition to the Badgley Mischka collaboration, it rolled out a team-up with Natalie\u2019s Juice, selling bottles of orange juice featuring a custom Lilly Pulitzer sticker. The nod to the brand\u2019s origin story made it a natural fit for its diehard consumers, Kelly said. The brand is predominantly a direct-to-consumer business, with 85 percent of its sales coming from its own channels. That means it\u2019s more insulated from wholesale troubles, but more reliant on its direct connection with consumers. With about 66 percent of its direct sales coming online, Lilly Pulitzer wants to grow its brick-and-mortar presence and plans to open six stores in 2024, including a new location in Cranston, Rhode Island that opened its doors in April. To reach new consumers \u2014 and reconnect with older ones \u2014 it\u2019s also building its presence on TikTok, creating more cuts of its ads to run across various platforms. The hope is all these ingredients will keep the brand\u2019s longtime loyalists happy, but intrigue new customers, too. \u201cSometimes brands just have periods where they have popularity again because they take a fresher direction,\u201d said Burke. \u201cThere\u2019s no written script for it, but it certainly has incredibly good bones.\u201d This article was originally published by\u00a0The Business of Fashion, an editorial partner of CNN Style.

{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}

The 3.3 million square-meter Al Khuwair Muscat Downtown and Waterfront development will include a residential complex, a marina, a cultural district, numerous canal walkways and a ministerial campus. Work is set to start at the end of this year and the area is expected to house more than 60,000 people when completed. ZHA\u2019s associate director, architect Paolo Zilli, told CNN he spent around a year finalizing the model he presented to Oman\u2019s Ministry of Housing and Urban Planning. Central to ZIlli\u2019s design was facilitating access to public transport. \u201cThe vision is actually to remove all the cars, to remove all the fences and to create a campus of the ministry with many functions that can attract families and a new generation,\u201d he said.

{"id": "style_alopecia-in-art-history-wellness", "text": "At least 40% of women experience\u00a0hair loss or alopecia over their lifetimes. This could be alopecia areata (patchy hair loss), traction alopecia (strained hair loss) or another form. The different ways that women\u2019s hair loss has been depicted across art history demonstrates the many different ways it has been interpreted over the years. In 16th and 17th century Britain, for example, women\u2019s alopecia was sometimes interpreted as\u00a0retribution for sins, including adultery. Some historical art, however, depicts a more neutral, or even positive, attitude towards women\u2019s alopecia. In religious or mythical art, it was sometimes idealized as divine. \u201cMadonna and Child\u201d (pictured top), painted in the 15th century by Italian Renaissance artist Carlo Crivelli, shows Jesus and Mary embracing in a gold, stylized setting. The pair sit behind a religious altar surrounded by ripe fruit and adorned with halos. Madonna has a high forehead and her blonde hair recedes, particularly on her right temple. This association between alopecia and divinity is echoed in a work by another Renaissance Italian artist, Cosm\u00e8 Tura. His\u00a0\u201dMadonna and Mary Magdalene\u201d\u00a0(circa 1490) depicts both mother and child with prominent foreheads. A glazed terracotta piece created by the Italian sculptor Andrea della Robbia in 1475 features Prudence, a human embodiment of Christian morality, as a balding two-headed person. Baldness in women has been connected to the divine for various reasons. It took the emphasis off of personal appearance in favour of deeper, more spiritual, priorities. But intentional hair removal played a role too. For some religious people, such as Buddhist nuns and Haredi Jewish wives, a bald head is thought to be\u00a0purer\u00a0and shaving can represent a\u00a0regular, sacrificial ritual. Ancient depictions Artwork on the walls of the tomb of the ancient Egyptian pharaoh, Akhenaten who ruled from 1351 to 1334 B.C., depicts two of his daughters, naked, with bald heads. Head shaving as well as natural baldness was common among the ancient Egyptians, including women. In fact, ancient Egyptians had\u00a0distinct terms\u00a0for female and male alopecia. This attests to just how common baldness, head shaving and wig wearing were for both sexes in ancient Egypt. And it isn\u2019t just Egypt. Partial and full head shaving has historically been common among women across sub-Saharan Africa. As\u00a0one traveller observed\u00a0among the inhabitants of the 18th century Kingdom of Issini (modern-day Ghana): \u201cSome only shave one half of the head \u2026 Others leave broad patches here and there unshaved.\u201d Medieval and Renaissance alopecia The 15th century painting, \u201cPortrait of a Woman with a Man at a Casement,\u201d by the Italian artist, Fra Filippo Lippi, features an aristocratic profile of a woman facing a man. She has a prominent forehead and high hairline. The appearance of recessed frontal hairlines in Medieval and Renaissance Europe\u00a0may have been fashionable\u00a0and even considered a sign of intelligence, encouraging customs of forehead shaving and eyebrow plucking. The 16th century queen of England, Elizabeth I, was often painted in this way.\u00a0One undated oil portrait\u00a0of the British monarch depicts her in bejeweled robes, with a pearl emblazoned veil and a prominent forehead. The removal of female bodily hair at this time, including on the forehead, wasn\u2019t just a matter of fashion. It also arguably arose due to patriarchal ideas that women\u2019s body hair was\u00a0dirty and even dangerous to men. Modern alopecia Adverts\u00a0and\u00a0research\u00a0today tend to discuss hair loss exclusively through medical terms, as a kind of detrimental disease. A recent\u00a0BBC article\u00a0refers to people with alopecia areata as \u201cpatients\u201d and their experience of it as \u201cprofoundly challenging\u201d. This certainly reflects some experiences, but not those who interpret their hair loss more neutrally, or even with\u00a0pride. Pharmaceutical and cosmetic products are promoted as \u201cnecessary\u201d treatments. A newly licensed drug, litfulo or ritlecitinib, was\u00a0hailed\u00a0last month as the \u201cfirst treatment\u201d and \u201cmedicine\u201d for alopecia. But as many forms of alopecia are not delimiting and as the \u201ctreatments\u201d on offer have limited efficacy and potential safety issues, this should\u00a0not be the default response. For example, the\u00a0European Medicine Agency\u00a0notes that ritlecitinib results in 80% hair regrowth but only for 36% of people taking it. About 10% are at risk of diarrhea, acne and throat infections. Another study\u00a0noted that\u00a0similar alopecia drugs, that operate through immunosuppression, only seem to work if they are taken continuously, yet their long-term safety has not been established. Depictions of alopecia throughout art history are a reminder of the many complicated ways women\u2019s hair loss has been viewed. Sometimes weaponized as a way to shame women, sometimes venerated as a sign of the divine, the truth is that hair loss really indicates nothing about a woman\u2019s worth, morality or status. But historical depictions of women\u2019s alopecia and baldness provide hope. They show that alopecia has been conceptualized differently at different times. This means the current framing of alopecia as an inevitably disadvantaging disease in need of certain \u201ctreatments\u201d might be biased too. They suggest if our societal interpretation of alopecia improves (as something that shouldn\u2019t be stigmatized), then so too may the individual experience (as something that shouldn\u2019t be dreaded).", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/alopecia-in-art-history-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_style_new-miss-usa-crowned-hawaii-savannah-gankiewicz", "text": "Amid a dramatic two weeks of resignations and allegations made against the Miss USA organization, Miss Hawaii USA Savannah Gankiewicz \u2014 who had originally placed as the first runner-up at the 2023 Miss USA pageant \u2014 has stepped up to be crowned Miss USA. \u201cWhile this decision was not made lightly, I firmly believe that this opportunity was meant for me and I am ready to make a positive impact with this organization that I hold dear to my heart,\u201d said the 28-year-old, who was crowned by the governor of Hawaii Josh Green at a ceremony in Honolulu, Hawaii, on Wednesday. \u201cI am dedicated to taking action and making a difference. With my background as a certified mental health first aid responder and training in anti-bullying suicide prevention. I understand, the importance of prioritizing your well-being and advocating for those in need. I believe that the true change starts from within and I am determined to lead by example and empower the class of 2024 and beyond,\u201d she said, addressing a crowd in a hotel in Waikiki, a small aquarium in the background. Gankiewicz has taken over the title from Noelia Voigt, who suddenly gave up her crown earlier this month. Voigt cited her mental health as her reason for stepping down, but her resignation letter to the Miss Universe organization,\u00a0obtained\u00a0by CNN, accused CEO Laylah Rose, of \u201cactively building a culture of fear and control.\u201d Among her claims, she wrote that Miss USA management often failed to provide her with travel accommodations or an \u201ceffective handler,\u201d the latter leading to an instance where Voigt says she was sexually harassed during a Christmas parade in Sarasota, Florida, while alone with an unnamed person in a car. The Miss Universe organization and Rose, through Miss USA, did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Two days after Voigt\u2019s resignation, Miss Teen USA 2023 UmaSofia Srivastava relinquished her title as well, writing on Instagram that her values \u201cno longer fully align with the direction of the organization.\u201d In her first official appearance since the controversy, Rose did not address any of the allegations. She welcomed Gankiewicz to the Miss USA family telling her to \u201cembrace this moment of influence and let your words carry the power of positive change,\u201d and thanked her corporate partners and sponsors for their \u201cunwavering support.\u201d Rose said that this year\u2019s Miss Teen USA and Miss USA pageants would take place in Los Angeles and would broadcast on the CW network. The CW announced a multi-year agreement to air the two pageants in April, but in light of recent allegations, USA Today reported Monday that the network was \u201cevaluating\u201d its relationship with the Miss USA organization. The CW did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Tumult and turnover Currently, the Miss Teen USA role remains unfilled. The first runner-up from 2023, New York\u2019s Stephanie Skinner, declined to be crowned in a public statement on Instagram. On Tuesday, Voigt and Srivastava\u2019s mothers spoke out on \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d saying their daughters remained under strict non-disclosure agreements in their contracts and could not talk about their experiences. \u201cThe job of their dreams turned out to be a nightmare,\u201d Barbara Srivastava said. \u201cThe girls decided to step down and give (up) their dream of a lifetime \u2014 a crown, a national title. Why would two girls decide to give that up?\u201d During their reigning year, she added, their daughters were \u201cill-treated, abused, bullied and cornered,\u201d she added. Miss USA and Miss Universe Organization have not returned CNN\u2019s multiple requests for comment. Though many current Miss USA state titleholders expressed their public support on Instagram following Voigt\u2019s resignation, this week, the reigning Miss Colorado USA, Arianna Lemus, gave up her title completely. \u201cMy values were compromised. Silencing women is not the definition of pageantry,\u201d she told CNN on Wednesday. \u201cAs a collective, the 2023 (Miss USA) class came together in solidarity with Noelia, but that wasn\u2019t enough for me\u2026 and that\u2019s why I resigned.\u201d Gankiewicz will only hold the Miss USA title for a few months this summer, until a new contestant from the 2024 class of state titleholders takes the national crown in August at the next Miss USA pageant. On Instagram, she had acknowledged the limitations of her role, saying, \u201cWith the little time I have as Miss USA, it is my intention to bring attention and focus onto the rebuilding of Lahaina on my island of Maui. I also look forward to helping the 2024 delegates transition into a new era of Miss USA and supporting them on their own journeys towards the crown.\u201d Lemus, meanwhile, called on urgent action to protect 2024 titleholders and beyond from restrictive contracts. Voigt\u2019s mother, Jackeline Voigt, said on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d that contestants should reconsider competing at all. \u201cLook at what happened to Noelia and UmaSofia,\u201d she said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s not the right time to participate.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/style/new-miss-usa-crowned-hawaii-savannah-gankiewicz/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}

They used the animal\u2019s feathers for fashion accessories and stuffed huia were mounted as decoration in wealthy homes, according to the museum. The museum explains that Maori\u00a0and European\u00a0hunters killed the bird in \u201cgreat numbers\u201d during the 19th century, selling the skin to collectors and fashion merchants. The huia\u2019s \u201clethal popularity\u201d reportedly grew even more when the\u00a0Duke and Duchess of York were photographed\u00a0wearing feathers in their hats during a trip to New Zealand in 1901. \u201cPeople kind of had a frenzy and decided that everyone wanted a huia feather,\u201d said Morris of the event. Attempts made by scientists in the early 1900s to conserve the remaining huia failed. A government plan to ship the birds to offshore islands resulted in those who collected the birds to sell them as dead specimens, according to the museum, adding It was more \u201cprofitable\u201d than keeping them alive. The auction house said that all prospective buyers were required to provide a permit from New Zealand\u2019s Ministry for Culture and Heritage in advance of Monday\u2019s sale. As an object of national importance, the feather could only be purchased by registered collectors and cannot leave the country without permission from the ministry. The sale follows that of a Victorian pair of taxi-dermied huia which sold for $457,704 (about $280,000) at a UK auction last year, according to the auction house.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/style/huia-feather-sold-new-zealand-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "style_article_sunil-gupta-india-gate-snap", "text": "To passersby, the sight of two men embracing besides New Delhi\u2019s India Gate in 1986 might have seemed unremarkable. In a city where public displays of platonic male affection are relatively commonplace, it was photographer Sunil Gupta who attracted more attention at the time. \u201cMen holding hands or lying in each other\u2019s laps is not an issue \u2014 it looks very romantic from (the outside), but they\u2019re usually just hanging out,\u201d he said in a video interview from the UK, before recalling: \u201cI was creating more interest than them, because I was standing there with a tripod and a camera, so everybody was focused on me.\u201d Onlookers may not have realized, but Gupta was creating a subtly subversive image in what he has described as the \u201crepressive atmosphere\u201d of 1980s India. At a time when homosexuality was more taboo in the country than it is today \u2014 and with consensual gay sex then criminalized as an \u201cunnatural offense\u201d \u2014 the photographer had found his subjects via the informal networks constituting Delhi\u2019s gay scene. The pair in question had chosen the war monument\u2019s gardens for their photo shoot due to its reputation as a cruising spot.  Having lived in New Delhi until his mid-teens, London-based Gupta knew this from personal experience. \u201cI passed that place on my way to school every day for 11 years,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just had to hop off the bus and get laid on your way home. It was very easy.\u201d The image forms part of the photographer\u2019s series \u201cExiles,\u201d which was first exhibited in the UK in 1987 but is this week showing at the India Art Fair in New Delhi. Primarily shot outdoors around India\u2019s capital, it captures gay men sat on benches or in public places popular among those looking for casual sexual partners, their faces often out of shot or turned away from the camera. Concerned about \u201couting\u201d his subjects, Gupta treated them as collaborators in what he called a \u201cconstructed documentary\u201d approach. After shooting his images and developing the film in London, he returned to Delhi with printed contact sheets to ensure the men were comfortable with the pictures he selected for his show. \u201cThere was quite a bit of horsing around in the pictures,\u201d he said of the India Gate shoot. \u201cAnd there were other photos that were (more suggestive)\u2026 So I picked a somewhat tamer one to put in the series.\u201d The other ethical challenge, he recalled, was communicating to the duo how the images would be used \u2014 and the art of photography itself. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t for publication, and the only way they saw pictures was in a magazine, so it took some explaining,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThen I tried to explain the process.\u201d Photography for many at the time, Gupta observed, was still \u201ca very mysterious thing that only a few people did in a darkroom.\u201d   For \u2018the canon\u2019  Now among India\u2019s most celebrated photographic artists, Gupta often addressed LGBTQ experiences in his explorations of race, immigration and identity. While studying in the US in the mid-1970s he produced a now-celebrated series of photos from New York\u2019s Christopher Street that captured the city\u2019s gay scene in the years between the Stonewall Riots and onset of the AIDS epidemic. Although \u201cExiles\u201d presented a rare portrait of gay life outside the West, Gupta\u2019s intended audience was always back in London. Homophobia was rife in 1980s Britain, and the photographer said he faced \u201ca lot of hostility\u201d at art school for making work relating to his sexuality. \u201cI couldn\u2019t make gay work, and I couldn\u2019t make gay work about India, especially,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was none in the library for reference. So, I thought, \u2018I\u2019m making it my mission to make some. Not for India, but for this canon \u2014 we need to have gay Indian guys in our library, in our art schools, over here.\u2019\u201d New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art has since acquired several of the pictures for its permanent collection, signifying the series\u2019 place in contemporary photography. But it was not an instant success. \u201cIt didn\u2019t have any impact when it was first shown,\u201d Gupta said of its debut.  \u201cI think it was too early.\u201d By the 1990s, however, interest in Gupta\u2019s work was growing, as art made by, and about, gay people of color became increasingly visible in the West. The fact that \u201cExiles\u201d is now showing in India, where he said it is positively received, is testament to changes on the subcontinent, too.  Although the country\u2019s LGBTQ communities still face significant social stigma, gay sex was decriminalized in 2018 and the arrival of apps like Grindr have been transformative, Gupta said. (\u201cThose sorts of chance meetings behind the bush are not happening \u2014 or maybe happening less,\u201d he added). This modern context and the power of hindsight have helped paint the photos in a new light. \u201cI think it has become historical enough that people are curious about what gay life was like before Grindr and the internet,\u201d Gupta said. \u201cPeople think it was all doom and gloom, and people jumping off buildings. They don\u2019t seem to appreciate that we also managed to have some kind of a life back then.\u201d This is a message reflected in the photographer\u2019s carefree India Gate shoot, which he recounts as a relaxed day of fun and abundant sunlight. \u201cIt just seemed very pleasurable. It was a nice day out, and I got to hang out with these guys who were having a good time and having a laugh.\u201d \u201cExiles\u201d is showing via Vadehra Art Gallery at India Art Fair, which runs February 9-12 in New Delhi, India. A book of outtakes from the series, published by Aperture, is available now.", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/article/sunil-gupta-india-gate-snap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}

Roberts, an actor who has become a mainstay of rom coms and campy horror \u2014 the latter, most recently with recurring roles in the anthology series \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d \u2014 bought the home, which she shares with her three-year-old son Rhodes, in 2022 and hired the design firm Pierce & Ward to overhaul its interiors. In the May issue of Architectural Digest, she reveals the results of that makeover. For Roberts, having a space that feels like home is a particular priority, she explained, as she moved often as a child. So when she saw the property listed as a rental on Instagram (it has been reported as a former residence of Minnie Driver), she inquired if she could purchase it instead. \u201cI think I lived in 10 houses by the time I was 15 \u2014 so for me now, having a son, I wanted a place that felt really ours.\u201d she told AD. \u201cI have a picture of the day we moved in\u2026 I just remember feeling like we are exactly where we need to be.\u201d The designers, Louisa Pierce and Emily Ward, with whom Roberts had previously worked, are known for down-to-earth spaces that mix bohemian, mid-century modern and rustic styles. Their clients have included Roberts\u2019 \u201cMadame Web\u201d co-star Dakota Johnson as well as Kate Hudson and Leonardo DiCaprio. \u201cWe want a house to look like it\u2019s been there for 50 years,\u201d Pierce told AD in the cover story. \u201cWe never want a home to look new.\u201d In that spirit, much of Roberts\u2019 furniture, art and decor is repurposed or reupholstered. In the living room, beneath a disco ball-like globe light, paperbacks are enclosed in living room cabinets while rarer books are openly displayed. Framed photographs of Debbie Harry and Joni Mitchell rest on wooden cabinets; elsewhere, one of Roberts\u2019 most treasured artworks \u2014 a Julian Wasser portrait of Joan Didion in front of a Corvette \u2014 hangs on the wall. Though many pieces are courtesy of design studios or antique finds, Pierce and Ward don\u2019t look down on more accessible commercial brands. Roberts recalled when she asked if her new kitchen island was custom-made, they laughed and said it was from Urban Outfitters. As for a room for Rhodes, who is starting his own book collection, Roberts opted for a soothing wallpaper scene of flying ducks on the ceiling, above a lush forest-themed upholstered bed. \u201cI remember as a kid, whatever\u2019s on your wall and your ceiling is seared into your brain for the rest of your life,\u201d Roberts explained. \u201cSo I wanted to make it extra cozy and fun, but not too overwhelming.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/16/style/emma-roberts-la-home-architectural-digest/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_style_and-just-like-that-carrie-bradshaw-fashion-lotw", "text": "Carrie Bradshaw, the lead character played by Sarah Jessica Parker in the 1998-2004 TV series \u201cSex and the City,\u201d has always been more of a fashion daredevil than a fashion darling. From the time she wore a floating belt fastened across her bare midriff (season 4 episode 15) to the cowboy hat, python-print bandeau and striped sarong (season 2, episode 17), Parker\u2019s on-screen persona has never shied away from making a bold style statement. Bradshaw\u2019s sartorial abandon has long been part of her quirky allure. The Instagram account, @everyoutfitonsatc, has provided a diligent digital archive of the character\u2019s best looks for its 746,000 followers. Many of the early SATC outfits documented are met with pure adoration by a throng of Carrie apologists ready to jump to her defense in the comments, even for the more visually challenging ensembles. \u201cThis is one of my favorite Carrie looks! Something only she could\u2019ve pulled off,\u201d wrote one fan under an image of Bradshaw in a clashing neon pink and green Betsy Johnson tulle dress \u2014 complete with abstract printed leggings. \u201cShe\u2019d look fabulous wearing anything.\u201d But since the launch of the series reboot \u201cAnd Just Like That\u2026\u201d in 2021, Bradshaw\u2019s wacky wardrobe has drawn more criticism than kudos. (HBO and Max, which airs \u201cAnd Just Like That\u2026,\u201d are also owned by CNN\u2019s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.) As filming for the show\u2019s third season continues around New York City, Bradshaw has so far been spotted in ensembles including wearing a sheer, rose-stuffed frock from the Irish designer Simone Rocha (pictured above), as well as a vintage color-blocked Ossie Clark dress and an oversize floppy Maryam Keyhani gingham sun hat. These looks have seemingly fallen flat with some viewers of the show. \u201cDefinitely too much,\u201d read one critique under @everyoutfitonsatc\u2019s post of Jessica Parker in the latter look. \u201cThis was not Carrie\u2019s style\u2026 This is trash,\u201d read another. (Commentary surrounding the Simone Rocha-designed look was somewhat kinder, however, with dedicated followers of Bradshaw\u2019s fashions showing appreciation for the nod to the character\u2019s love of florals \u2014 and a visible bra. So was the response to the first new look Jessica Parker was spotted in while filming in recent weeks: A pair of prissy vintage pastel separates from YSL and Ralph Lauren respectively.) The departure of Patricia Field, longtime stylist on \u201cSex and the City,\u201d has given some sartorially-minded viewers of \u201cAnd Just Like That\u2026\u201d a scapegoat for their grumblings. But Field plowed her own absurdist furrow when curating her characters\u2019 wardrobes (and beyond). \u201cFollowing fashion trends? It\u2019s a waste,\u201d she told The Guardian in February. \u201cTo me, fashion is a cousin of art. And like art, originality is what counts. When it starts to feel intimidating, it\u2019s time to change.\u201d It\u2019s an instinct that the show\u2019s current stylists, Molly Rogers and Danny Santiago, have honored with Bradshaw\u2019s melting pot of patterns and silhouettes \u2014 but one that has gone under appreciated. So has Bradshaw\u2019s style really changed, or have we? Are audiences less tolerant towards an off-beat dresser in her late 50s, when compared to one in her 30s? It seems like a ripe topic for the character\u2019s newspaper column, and one Jessica Parker has thoughts on too. \u201cThere\u2019s so much misogynist chatter in response to us that would never. Happen. About. A. Man,\u201d the actor told Vogue in 2021. \u201cEspecially on social media.

{"id": "style_worlds-largest-3d-printer-homes-maine-hnk-spc-intl", "text": "Dozens of 3D-printed homes have been built across the world \u2013 to house a family in the US state of Virginia or members of an impoverished community in rural Mexico. The world\u2019s largest 3D-printed neighborhood is currently under construction outside of Austin, Texas. The technology could be especially handy in a place like the US state of Maine, where approximately 80,000 new homes will be needed by 2030 to address a shortage, according to a report released last year by three state agencies. \u201cPeople can\u2019t find homes, they\u2019re very expensive. We also have an aging population \u2026 so there\u2019s less and less people who are electricians, plumbers, or builders,\u201d Habib Dagher, the executive director of the University of Maine\u2019s Advanced Structures and Composites Center (ASCC), told CNN via video call. He says he\u2019s got a solution. Last month, the ASCC unveiled what it says is the world\u2019s largest polymer 3D printer. Dagher hopes the-so-called \u201cFactory of the Future 1.0\u201d can help address the state\u2019s housing crisis \u2013 and revolutionize 3D-home-printing in the process. \u201cThe approach we\u2019ve taken is quite different from what you\u2019ve seen, and you\u2019ve been reading about for years,\u201d he says. A home every 48 hours In recent years, 3D-printing has been used to build everything from businesses to bridges to mosques. One non-profit is even working on printing schools in a war zone. Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, holds the Guinness World Record for the world\u2019s biggest 3D-printed structure and aims to have 25% of new buildings constructed with 3D printing technology by 2030. A great majority of current printing relies on concrete, with a robotic arm equipped with a nozzle layering wet concrete into the right shape. ASCC is flipping the script. Its giant printer, and its predecessor, which in 2019 was certified by Guinness World Records as the \u201clargest prototype polymer 3D printer,\u201d are the only printers building homes with wood residuals, says Dagher. The technology has already been tested. In late 2022, the university unveiled the \u201cBioHome3D,\u201d a 600-square-foot single-family unit which it says is the world\u2019s first 100% bio-based 3D-printed home, built from local wood fiber and bio-resin materials. \u201cWhen they\u2019re doing concrete, they\u2019re only printing the walls,\u201d says Dagher. He adds that the floor, roof and walls of the BioHome3D were all printed. Concrete homes also need to be built on site, he says. That can be problematic, especially during the snowy New England winter. \u201cWhen the weather goes bad for two weeks at a time, you can\u2019t print,\u201d he adds. By contrast, ASCC printed prefabricated modules at the university and bolted them together on site to create BioHome3D. The new printer can produce objects as large as 96 feet long by 32 feet wide by 18 feet\u202fhigh and can print up to 500 pounds per hour. Dagher says that the goal is to be able to print 1,000 pounds of material in an hour. At that rate, it could reproduce the BioHome3D in 48 hours, he says. If they can reach that target, their 3D-printed homes will be \u201cvery competitive with current housing construction costs,\u201d he adds. But it can be difficult to process wood materials at such a high speed. Even ASCC\u2019s record-breaking printers sometimes jam. While printing BioHome3D, for example, the printer stopped working due to a dust buildup. \u201cNobody\u2019s ever done this before with these kinds of materials,\u201d says Dagher. \u2018When can I have one?\u2019 The BioHome3D\u2019s warm wooden floors and walls give it the look of a sleek, modern Scandinavian-inspired log cabin. \u201cMany people feel concrete is a cold thing to look at and it\u2019s not necessarily where you want to live,\u201d says Dagher. The BioHome3D, however, is \u201cvery warm and inviting.\u201d It\u2019s also sustainable. When a home is no longer needed or wanted it can be ground up and used to print something else. ASCC is using wood residuals from Maine\u2019s sawmills in its research, and looking into scaling up production using these local byproducts. Thousands of people have toured the prototype on the university\u2019s Orono, Maine campus, and Dagher says it\u2019s a rare occurrence when a visitor doesn\u2019t ask, \u201c\u2019When can I have one?\u2019\u201d \u201cWe hear, \u2018You know, I\u2019m retiring, and I want to downsize. Can I put one of these up?\u2019\u201d Dagher says. There are some obstacles to overcome first. \u201cIt takes years for codes to change,\u201d says Dagher, referring to building codes that construction companies must meet. The printer won\u2019t displace traditional home construction, but in the future 3D printed homes are likely to comprise a larger share of the world\u2019s housing stock, he predicts. The ASCC is now doing work on how to incorporate conduits for wiring and plumbing \u201cexactly where an architect would want them\u201d into the printing process, he adds. The printer\u2019s next big project is a nine-home neighborhood for people experiencing homelessness. ASCC is partnering with a local NGO to design the structures, and printing is set to kick off in 2025.", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/worlds-largest-3d-printer-homes-maine-hnk-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_style_parties-monaco-grand-prix-f1", "text": "The Monaco Grand Prix gets underway this weekend in Monte Carlo with its heady combination of glamor and adrenaline, not only for the tens of thousands who descend on the pristine principality, but for the millions watching across the world. Even those who are typically indifferent to motorsports can find themselves enraptured, or at least intrigued, by the sheer spectacle of Formula One cars hurtling along the country\u2019s winding streets. It is also where you will find celebrities happily jostling their way through the crowds and cameras. \u201cIt is unlike anything I have ever been to, it is electric,\u201d exclaimed Spider-Man actor Tom Holland while walking last year\u2019s grid. And of course, there is plenty of wealth on display. Monaco is nicknamed \u201cthe billionaires\u2019 playground\u201d for good reason. Here, designer stores, supercars, multi-million-dollar yachts and astronomically priced restaurants are \u2018la norme\u2019, but during the three-day Grand Prix, the eye-watering ostentation increases three-fold. When demand is high and options are limited, it is all to play for among the world\u2019s wealthiest who are keen to revel in the race\u2019s iconic location and party \u2018til dawn. If they are not using their own superyacht as a base, they might book into a private villa on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur or check-in to Fairmont Hotel, H\u00f4tel Hermitage or H\u00f4tel de Paris in Monte Carlo itself. A pioneer of Grand Prix party culture Of course, it is not only about finding the finest suites to rest your head, but the premium spots for dining and clubbing, whether it is the top table at Cipriani, Sass Caf\u00e9 or Caf\u00e9 de Paris or the best booth at exclusive night spots such as Jimmy\u2019z or Amber Lounge. The latter has the distinction of being the go-to destination for the F1 fraternity, including Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen, while previous guests have included Justin Bieber, Kim Kardashian, Kylie Minogue and Prince Albert of Monaco. Established in 2003 by former racing driver Eddie Irvine\u2019s sister Sonia as a \u201cpost-race destination\u201d for drivers and VIP guests, Amber Lounge is regarded a pioneer of the Grand Prix party culture. Notably, it will be marking its 20-year milestone (there was a year off during Covid) as \u201cthe most exclusive party in the world\u201d with panache over the Monaco weekend with three nights of events costing just over \u20ac1.5m ($1.6m) to produce. There will be after parties at an Amber Lounge beach club on the terrace of Le Meridien Beach Plaza (the only hotel in Monte Carlo with its own private beach), as well as VIP viewing of the race from aboard a 108ft superyacht moored just feet from the circuit\u2019s famous Tabac corner. \u201cThe size of the yacht also means we are as close to the action as you can get, unlike the larger yachts that are pulled back (from the coast). It also feels more intimate and exclusive on board. We have a lot of repeat clients (typically from the US, UK and Middle East) who want to network and build relationships,\u201d said Lauren Green, Managing Director of Amber Lounge who oversees logistics of the three-day pop-up event in Monaco, as well as other F1 locations including Singapore, Las Vegas and Abu Dhabi. Unsurprisingly, a ticket to one of the most coveted trackside spots does not come cheap. A one-day VIP viewing package for the race itself on Sunday costs \u20ac3,500 ($3,800) per person \u2014 and the 65 available tickets sold out within two weeks of going on sale in May 2023. While the dress code is \u2018Riviera chic,\u2019 shoes, however expensive, must be discarded on embarking so as not to ruin the yacht\u2019s teak decking. Tickets include free-flowing beverages, including champagne, wine and signature cocktails, as well as food, a DJ and dancers before tenders return to shore at 6.30pm. \u2018The center of the universe for a weekend\u2019 At the club\u2019s after parties held over the race weekend, a small army of waiting staff serve ever-flowing drinks for a 1000 strong crowd on Saturday and Sunday nights. On arrival, guests ring a bell and a gloved hand appears through a flower wall proffering a glass of champagne. Attendees have paid anything from \u20ac600 ($650) for entry to the afterparty on Saturday (the F1 qualifying day) to \u20ac800 ($870) on the Sunday (race day) in the hope they can party alongside drivers, celebrities and guests of high net worth, away from the public gaze. For \u20ac40,000 ($43,400), partygoers can book what\u2019s known as a \u201cdiamond table package\u201d for 10 people \u2014 a prime table with unobstructed views of the stage and DJ booth (Fatman Scoop and Jax Jones are the acts for 2024), as well as cirqus-themed performances, and Methuselahs of champagne (6-liters) and premium vodka. Add an extra \u20ac10,000 ($10,800) on for a Salmanazar \u2014 a nine-liter bottle of champagne that requires a team of four to carry it to the table, or \u20ac20,000 ($21,600) for a 12-liter Balthazar-sized bottle. The top-tier tables also have their own \u201chosts,\u201d who act as a concierge; liaising with VIPs\u2019 assistants or drivers to ensure guests can be greeted and escorted along the black carpet without having to queue. Amber Lounge might be one of the most exclusive and expensive events taking place during the Monaco Grand Prix weekend, but Monte Carlo itself is a veritable party hub. It\u2019s common for champagne glasses and bottles to be cleared from the track from the previous night\u2019s revelry ahead of that day\u2019s qualifying or race sessions. \u201cThe C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur is one of the truly exceptional global destinations, and Monaco is at the heart of it. The scenery, the sophistication, and the opulence are unmatched,\u201d said Bruce Bundrant, Senior Vice President of Business Development for rEvolution, a global sports marketing agency who lived in Monaco for three years as Commercial Director for AS Monaco FC. \u201cAs a former resident, I can tell you there are two sides to the F1 Grand Prix arriving in Monaco. On one side, your town is now the center of the universe for a weekend where the top 1% of the 1% from all over the world arrive and engage in outrageous parties and events on yachts, at luxury hotels suites, and in hilltop mansions,\u201d Bundrant explained. \u201cOn the other, it\u2019s the hybrid of the arrival of a hurricane and New Year\u2019s Eve. A week out from the race, grocery store shelves are emptied as locals know it\u2019s impossible to move around the principality when the F1 circus is in town. During the Grand Prix, your quiet, regular neighborhood bar has a line around the corner, charges a $100 cover charge, and a drink that typically costs $20 will be $50. But it\u2019s a truly unforgettable weekend, with an unreplicable buzz and energy. Sure, it\u2019s expensive, but come the Monday, things are back to normal.\u201d As normal as it can ever be in a place as excessive as Monaco.

{"id": "2024_06_07_style_louis-vuitton-pietro-beccari-olympics", "text": "There are familiar sights synonymous with every Olympics and Paralympics \u2014 emotional athletes, jubilant crowds, stands filled with colorful flags. And at next month\u2019s upcoming Games, Louis Vuitton are hoping they too will become a hallmark of the same grand occasion. The luxury house\u2019s distinctive Damier checkerboard trunks will house the Olympic torch as it travels across France, and Vuitton has created medal cases for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Seven French athletes \u2014 from fencer Enzo Lefort and swimmer L\u00e9on Marchand to wheelchair tennis champion Pauline D\u00e9roul\u00e8de and para-cyclist Marie Patouillet \u2014 will also act as ambassadors for the brand. The Olympics, and the extraordinary journeys that athletes take to reach them, closely align with the values at the heart of the French luxury fashion house, its chairman and CEO Pietro Beccari told CNN in an interview at the brand\u2019s headquarters in Paris. \u201cWe talk about excellence, we spoke about quality, we spoke about being prepared for every challenge, and that is something that is very close to our heart,\u201d Beccari said, adding that Louis Vuitton is \u201cvery proud to be a French group\u201d and willing to support its home Olympics in the \u201cmost beautiful city in the world.\u201d As one would expect from a company who also designs the trophy trunks for such events as the soccer World Cup and the F1 Grand Prix de Monaco, these are no ordinary pieces of luggage. The interiors of both trunks are lined with matte black leather; one featuring circular \u201csockets\u201d in its base and lid to safely house and transport the Olympic torch, while the other contains enough drawers to store hundreds of medals. LVMH \u2013 the luxury conglomerate that owns Louis Vuitton \u2013 spent \u20ac150 million ($163 million) on its sponsorship deal with the Olympics, Vogue reported citing sources, though calculating the precise returns on this investment is \u201cdifficult,\u201d said Beccari.  \u201cWe believe this campaign is building values, building desirability,\u201d he said. \u201cQuantifying it is very difficult, not that we didn\u2019t try but it\u2019s very very difficult or impossible.\u201d The fashion house has long associated itself with sport, sponsoring nautical events like the Americas Cup, as well as launching a recent campaign centered around the friendship of tennis legends Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. \u201cWe are very close to sport,\u201d Beccari said, recalling the slogan \u201cVictory travels in Louis Vuitton,\u201d the fashion house used when one of its trunks housed the FIFA World Cup in 2010. \u201cI think it incarnates very well the DNA of Louis Vuitton, of what I was saying before, the challenges, the willingness to overcome yourself, to reach your destination and to be willing to go and discover more.\u201d This messaging underpinned a new campaign with Federer and Nadal sitting on a Louis Vuitton case on a snowy mountain in the Dolomites, discussing their rivalry, their biggest achievements and their sporting heroes. They\u2019re \u201ctwo beautiful young people that started from their little villages respectively in two different parts of Europe,\u201d Beccari said, \u201cand they became who they became so it\u2019s really part of this philosophy of excellence, of quality, of envy to surpass yourself over time again.\u201d While Louis Vuitton posted record profits last year and LVMH outperformed other luxury brands, the current economic environment with rising inflation leaving consumers with less disposable income poses challenges ahead, though Beccari downplayed such difficulties. \u201cIn terms of crisis, you always have to have the courage to see the opportunities and that\u2019s what we do,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there is a curve, and we like to do the curve with speed, so when the road will be straight again we\u2019ll have sufficient speed to be ahead of the others.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/style/louis-vuitton-pietro-beccari-olympics/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "style_article_liu-heung-shing-coca-cola-snap-mic-intl-hnk", "text": "A young man stands grinning in Beijing\u2019s Forbidden City. It\u2019s the dead of winter, and one of his hands is buried deep into the pockets of his long overcoat to protect it from the chill. The other grasps the unmistakable contours of a glass Coca-Cola bottle. Today, Coke is the world\u2019s most famous soft drink and can be found just about anywhere. But back in 1981, when the image was shot by Pulitzer-Prize winning photographer Liu Heung Shing, it was only just getting into the hands of ordinary Chinese people. Liu, who was in his late 20s when he began working for Time magazine in Beijing, felt the country was on the cusp of a great cultural shift following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976.  \u201cThe changes (at first) were subtle, and unless you lived there, you wouldn\u2019t have noticed,\u201d he recalled during an interview at his home in Hong Kong.  He had earlier photographed people grieving for Mao along the banks of the Pearl River in Guangzhou. It was here that he was struck by how differently people carried themselves compared to what he had seen in late-1950s China, where he grew up during the disastrous Great Leap Forward campaign \u2014 a series of failed industrialization policies \u2014 before moving back to Hong Kong as a child. Under Mao, the country went on to suffer from widespread famine and poverty, and the tumultuous years of the Cultural Revolution. But in the aftermath of the Chinese leader\u2019s death, Liu said, \u201csuddenly, people\u2019s steps looked a little bit lighter, they dropped their shoulders and their faces looked more relaxed.\u201d It would prove to be a relatively liberal period in Chinese history \u2014 politically, economically and in terms of everyday life, which Liu captured in candid shots. One photo from the time showed a plastic surgeon and his client after a cosmetic procedure. Another depicted people gathering at a \u201cDemocracy Wall\u201d in Beijing, where they wrote now-unthinkable criticisms of the government. One of Liu\u2019s most iconic images was captured on his way into the Time bureau after he had the strange feeling that something was \u201cmissing.\u201d He turned his car around and, sure enough, a large portrait of Mao that had once hung prominently on a building had been freshly taken down. He quickly shot images of workers gathered around the depiction of the late Chairman, with some of their scaffolding visible in the frame. This was China \u201cmoving out of the shadow of Mao,\u201d he said. \u2018It tastes so-so\u2019 In December 1978, Coca-Cola became the first foreign enterprise permitted to enter the mainland Chinese market since the communist revolution. That same month, Beijing and Washington announced the normalization of Sino-American relations and Deng Xiaoping kick-started China\u2019s transformative economic reforms with his \u201cOpen Door\u201d policy. (Coca-Cola was first introduced to China in the 1920s but had been forced to leave in 1949, along with other foreign companies, by a government that regarded it as bourgeois). Liu had photographed the opening of a joint-venture bottling plant in Beijing, capturing Coke chairman Roberto Goizueta and Chinese trade officials drinking Coca Cola and holding bottles aloft to cries of \u201cganbei\u201d (cheers). He then thought to himself, \u201cNow where do I find a (regular) Chinese person enjoying this (drink)?\u201d He headed to the Forbidden City, with its heavy flow of tourists, and soon found a man named Zhang Wei purchasing a Coke from a small stand. \u201cI remember he made a comment when he drank this syrupy Coke: \u2018It tastes so-so\u2019\u201d said Liu, who ended up taking a few shots with one of the imperial palace\u2019s picturesque pavilions in the background.  The response to Coke itself may have been underwhelming, but the snap perfectly captured the curiosity and openness many Chinese people felt at the time. \u201cAs a photographer, I of course realized the significance. That this man, dressed in a ubiquitous PLA (People\u2019s Liberation Army) coat, was one of the very first people to taste it,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cBut I didn\u2019t realize it would become part of the Chinese collective memory.\u201d The image would be widely published and displayed in the following years, and he later became friends with Zhang. In 1983, it appeared in Liu\u2019s photography book \u201cChina after Mao,\u201d a collection of images taken between 1976 and 1982. More recently he included it in his book \u201cLiu Heung Shing: A Life in a Sea of Red.\u201d   The photographer would go on to document other periods and profound events in the country\u2019s modern history, including the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. And just like those pictures of young student activists calling for democracy, Liu\u2019s Coca-Cola photograph feels part of another era altogether. With its apparent embrace of the new and the foreign \u2014 ideas encapsulated in that most American of drinks \u2014 the image stands in stark contrast to today\u2019s China, where relations with the US are at an all-time low. Xi Jinping\u2019s nationalist agenda has generated increasingly xenophobic attitudes towards the West.   \u201cI realized that the story I did in the last quarter of the 20th century (would) continue to carry relevance into the 21st century,\u201d Liu said. \u201cEspecially with the story of China, I never doubt that these photographs are in the Chinese people\u2019s collective memory. \u201cEven though this memory keeps being re-edited\u2026 the good thing about a photograph, is you cannot re-edit it. It becomes an image seared in people\u2019s minds.\u201d Top image: A 1981 photograph of a man with a Coke bottle in Beijing\u2019s Forbidden City, shot by Liu Heung Shing.

The designer took on the position following Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s death in 2019 after working alongside him at Chanel for decades. She held one of fashion\u2019s most coveted and elite jobs \u2014 with only Lagerfeld and Gabrielle \u201cCoco\u201d Chanel herself acting as previous artistic directors for the storied brand. In a press statement to CNN, Chanel confirmed Viard\u2019s departure, writing that while the 62-year-old designer was at the helm, \u201cshe was able to renew the codes of the house while respecting the creative heritage of Chanel, and almost thirty years within the house.\u201d A successor has yet to be named, but the brand added that an announcement would be made \u201cin due course.\u201d Chanel said that it wanted to thank Viard \u201cfor her remarkable contribution to Chanel\u2019s fashion, creativity and vitality.\u201d Just last month, Chanel\u2019s chief executive Leena Nair told The Business of Fashion that \u201csince Virginie took over from Karl\u2026 the Chanel fashion business has multiplied by 2.2. The Chanel ready-to-wear business has been multiplied by 2.5, and the ready-to-wear business last year of Chanel grew by 23%.\u201d The brand\u2019s earnings rose 16 percent to $19.7 billion in 2023. As one of the industry\u2019s most iconic and powerful players, Lagerfeld\u2019s death in 2019 rocked the fashion world, and while he also headed up Fendi and his eponymous label at the time of his death, it was Lagerfeld\u2019s prolific work at Chanel that he was best known for. Viard, who started at Chanel as an intern in 1987, went on to become Lagerfeld\u2019s deputy for decades. So close was the pair\u2019s working relationship that the German designer once described her as \u201cmy right arm and my left arm.\u201d Viard\u2019s 2019 appointment came as no surprise, with Chanel reiterating that the decision was made \u201cso that the legacy of Gabrielle Chanel and Karl Lagerfeld can live on.\u201d Who steps into the role this time will be a topic of serious speculation over the coming weeks. The news follows a series of high profile moves in the industry.

{"id": "style_article_reuben-wu-landscape-photography", "text": "The first time Reuben Wu saw the warm sandstone hues and vast, open skies of the American West, he was watching the landscapes pass him by from the window of a tour bus.  The British visual artist, now based in Chicago, has become known for his sublime imagery of remote landscapes using drone lighting, enhancing craggy peaks with halos, or writing glyphs in the sky like signals from a supernatural entity. But for a long time, art was just a passion project while he focused on a music career as one of the four members of the synth-pop band Ladytron. \u201c(Photography) started as an all-consuming hobby,\u201d he explained in a phone interview. But when Ladytron took a break in 2011 after five studio albums (they released a self-titled sixth album in 2019, and the seventh, \u201cTime\u2019s Arrow,\u201d this month), he began a new career from scratch. \u201cWhile the others did their own solo projects, making their own music and releasing their own albums, this was my solo project.\u201d Wu\u2019s imagery takes a classic photographer\u2019s combination \u2014 light and landscape \u2014 and marries the two in transformative ways. He often begins with dusky evening light or the ink-black shadows of night, then strategically illuminates portions of the scene with custom-built consumer drones. In one image, a bright horizontal line hangs over a glacier in the Peruvian Andes, revealing the brilliance of the ice against a dark sky. In a different motion piece, Wu simulated an electrical storm in Goblin Valley, Utah, but with perfectly straight strikes of light rather than the jagged bursts of lightning.  The artist\u2019s 2018 photo book \u201cLux Noctis\u201d is in the collections of the Guggenheim and Museum of Modern Art, in New York, and he has shot commercial work for Apple, Audi and Google as well as the DJ and music producer Zedd. Last summer, Wu revealed a colossal project for National Geographic: a cover story and timelapse multimedia piece about Stonehenge, which featured the enigmatic monument lit by his custom drones. In November, one of his NFTs, a 4K video loop titled \u201cAn Irresistible Force,\u201d outperformed its high estimate by over 25% during an auction at Sotheby\u2019s Hong Kong, selling at 441,000 HKD (about $56,500). \u201cI couldn\u2019t have dreamed of where I am now,\u201d Wu said. \u201cI just wanted to be able to make a living from doing art and from doing photography.\u201d  Alien inspiration Wu has always been drawn to wild, remote places where he could find solitude. His parents immigrated from Hong Kong to the UK before he was born, and he grew up an introverted child in Liverpool, he said, who didn\u2019t quite click with school. He was fascinated with science-fiction films that mix the alien with the everyday, such as Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind,\u201d which featured Wyoming\u2019s Devils Tower as a site for extraterrestrial contact. (Unfamiliar with American topography, he initially thought the butte, a national monument, was a fictional geological entity, he explained with a laugh).  The film\u2019s visuals of remote desert scenes mixed with eerie lights have been a formative inspiration in his own work. \u201c(It\u2019s) cemented into my brain, the idea of these seemingly impossible lights moving through the sky, kind of like search lights on very ordinary (American) landscapes,\u201d he said.  He embarked on his first cross-country photography trip across the US in 2013, around a decade after getting a taste on the road with Ladytron. The resulting series featured vivid depictions of the Grand Canyon and South Dakota Badlands, as well as a time-lapse image of Devils Tower at night among star trails.  Two years later, Wu discovered the effect that drone lighting could have on the natural world while working on an outdoor automotive shoot. \u201cI flew the drone up above some cliffs, and I was absolutely fascinated by the effect it had on the actual landscape,\u201d he explained. It made the cliffs glow, reaching areas that were otherwise impossible to light artificially.  Wu rigs lights on drones to suit his needs on any given shoot or project. The first iteration, he said, which he used when the technology was still nascent, was a \u201cmassive\u201d eight-rotor drone outfitted with homemade lights that only had about eight minutes of flight time. The next used a 3D-printed bracket with an LED hot light, but still only gave him an additional two minutes in the air. The tech he uses now gives him a bit more breathing room, with a half hour to fly out, capture images and return to him, but he\u2019s had to learn to work within the bounds of each set-up. \u201cI\u2019m a lot less anxious now, because I\u2019ve crashed a number of drones,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in the end, they\u2019re just tools.\u201d  Experimental series After developing series of still images such as \u201cLux Noctis\u201d and \u201cAeroglyphs,\u201d which experiment with ghostly lighting and geometric shapes in the skies, Wu found himself wanting to incorporate motion and sound into his work because of his own background in music. He began creating 15-second video loops from his images, showing light beams forming patterns or the moon arcing across the sky, to the beats of atmospheric electronic music that he produced. \u201cThese (works) were very much experimental and had no end goal \u2014 they were just things that I did for love out of love,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t license them, I couldn\u2019t print them\u2026 and so they were just there, stacking likes on my Instagram.\u201d But in January 2021, Wu found a way to make them a more substantial part of his career when he was introduced to NFT art. He minted his first \u201cnon-fungible token\u201d  on the marketplace Foundation two months later \u2014 an \u201caeroglyph\u201d of bright lines forming a rectangle above a beachside cliff. It sold for 30 ETH ($45,000), a portion of which he donated to the National Parks Conservation Association and the AAPI Community Fund. Later that year, the web3 arts organization Obscura commissioned him to produce a new set of images titled \u201cAeroglyph Variations,\u201d which took him into the New Mexico badlands for a 20-hour shoot that resulted in 55 images of the same setting, each with different lighting conditions and patterns. Wu has also experimented with presenting the work in different ways, from animations, to AR experiences, to projection mapping moving images onto physical prints. \u201cIt\u2019s very much a hybrid medium, and so I\u2019d like to expand that horizon even more, and think about the end goal for my work,\u201d he said. \u201cAm I creating a nice piece of art for people to look at and appreciate, or am I creating an experience for people to share?\u201d Wu is leaning towards the latter as he continues to experiment with the form his work takes, but no matter the medium, his vision of and approach to the natural world remains consistent. \u201cA lot of people always say that my work is otherworldly \u2014 that is the first word that people think of when they think about my work,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not trying to create an alien-looking image; I\u2019m trying to show that this is our planet. And there are so many new ways that are available to see it that can renew your perspective.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/article/reuben-wu-landscape-photography/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "style_omar-diop-lee-shulman-being-there", "text": "In 1967 romcom \u201cGuess Who\u2019s Coming To Dinner,\u201d Sidney Poitier\u2019s dashing doctor is dropped into the lives of the Draytons, a White middle class family, when their daughter arrives home and announces she has a fianc\u00e9. The parents are liberals, but the news is shocking; they\u2019re not sure if they approve of an interracial marriage. No matter that this man is handsome and of spotless character \u2013 he\u2019s Sidney Poitier, for crying out loud \u2013 his presence, in all its Blackness, marks an intrusion, upending this hitherto White space. Now imagine we know nothing about the Draytons. They could be civil rights campaigners or conservatives or card-carrying members of the KKK. And no Hollywood ending is guaranteed. That is the provocative space a puckish Omar Victor Diop finds himself in in \u201cBeing There.\u201d Conceived by British photographer Lee Shulman and Senegalese self-portraitist Diop, the series sees the duo utilize a collection of family photos from 1950s and 1960s America, editing Diop into a series of intimate scenes, both public and private, in spaces where Black people were often shut out. The 60 or so photos, Kodachrome slides purchased on eBay by Shulman years ago, are drawn from his \u201cAnonymous Project,\u201d so named because Shulman has no idea of the identities of any of the people in them. The collection has spurred on multiple side projects, including a book with British photographer Martin Parr, and now \u201cBeing There,\u201d which debuted at Paris Photo in November 2023 and was recently turned into a coffee table book. \u201cBeing There\u201d came to life when Shulman noticed many of the slides contained an empty seat \u2013 presumably that the photographer had vacated to take the photo. \u201cThere was an absence,\u201d he told CNN in a joint video interview with Diop. That they were taken in America circa the civil rights movement, but also of a segregated South, \u201cplayed on my mind a lot,\u201d he explained. That absence became abstracted. The person missing from the seat evolved into a totem of worlds and peoples often excluded from the privileges of White America. \u201cEvery time I saw that chair, I saw Omar in (it),\u201d Shulman added. Though the two photographers had never met, it tracks. Shulman owned a few works from the acclaimed self-portraitist, who has prior experience in this area. Diop\u2019s series \u201cDiaspora\u201d depicts Africans outside of Africa at different points in history (albeit with some contemporary \u2013 often soccer related \u00ad\u00ad\u2013 props). That sense of play and humor continues in \u201cBeing There,\u201d in which an oft-grinning Diop offers a cheeky presence in each still. Shulman and Diop curated the selection together. \u201cWe were looking for images that covered a broad spectrum of life, because it\u2019s a family photo album,\u201d said Shulman. There are signs of wealth: a ski holiday, a Hawaiian jaunt, a trip to the Grand Canyon, alongside more modest adventures like a roadside picnic and a day at the zoo. The camera goes inside homes, capturing Diop in the back of birthday celebrations and lounging with families. However quotidian, that these moments were captured by cameras is a sign of race and class privilege, argued Shulman. Other photographs, by nature of their location, are more charged. Diop splashes around in a public swimming pool; graduates from college; sits in a busy bar. He\u2019s surrounded by White faces as he does so, occupying spaces which were historically segregated in some states. \u201cThe political potential of this series made it very easy for me to jump into this,\u201d Diop said. \u201cWe tend to have this glamorized gaze towards history. And in doing so, we forget how it\u2019s easy not to make room for someone who\u2019s different,\u201d he added. \u201c(The series) is an invitation to look at our lives nowadays and see how many people different from us that we allow into our intimate circles.\u201d Ironically, inserting Diop into these spontaneous shots involved a lot of planning. Period props and costumes were used by Diop in a greenscreen set, with rigs mimicking the lighting of each slide. Digital post-production slotted him into the photographs, approximating the grade and grain of Kodachrome film, along with any shadows, blur and movement in the shot. Dressing up, Diop was struck by how much he looked like his father, who \u201claughed a lot going through the book,\u201d the portraitist said. \u201cHe\u2019d been a student in Europe in the late \u201950s, so he\u2019d been sitting at these tables,\u201d Diop added. \u201cOf course, you can\u2019t really compare (being an African in Europe) with what African Americans went through in the same era, but the idea of being different is something (they had in common).\u201d The collaborators never decided whether Diop is playing the same character in each photograph, or if it was a character at all, and not just Diop appearing as a time traveller. This ambiguity carries over into Diop\u2019s relationship with the lens. \u201cOne of the reasons it works is that gaze he sometimes has towards the camera,\u201d said Shulman, \u201cyou feel that he knows the photographer.\u201d On the other hand, if it\u2019s a case of Diop breaching the space-time continuum, photographs read as if he\u2019s bringing the viewer in on the secret. Likewise, neither resolved whether Diop was a welcome presence or gate-crasher in each scene. Despite having the slides in his possession for years, Shulman still knows next to nothing about their subjects. \u201cAs much as they\u2019re anonymous, they tell us a lot,\u201d he insisted. \u201cEvery time I look at these images, even without Omar in them, I feel these people are looking at us and telling us something about history.\u201d There is another, perhaps unintended, dimension to the photographs. The anonymity of the White people, and Shulman and Diop\u2019s lack of desire to investigate them and their inner lives, forces the viewer to rely on sign and symbol to construct identity. We don\u2019t know their politics, nor how they\u2019d respond to Diop\u2019s presence. Deprived of details, these lives become homogenized; bundled. In doing so, they\u2019re treated like so many people of color were when portrayed by what was, for decades, a hegemonic Western \u2013 and almost exclusively White \u2013 lens, which had a knack for stripping away nuance. Diop\u2019s winking presence, Black and African, seems to say, \u201cLook where I am\u201d but also, \u201cSee how you like it.\u201d Shulman insisted \u201cthere\u2019s no pointing fingers in this book,\u201d while later saying neither he nor Diop \u201cfeel like we own this project\u201d now that\u2019s out in the world and \u201clives its life.\u201d All interpretations are valid, a fact they say excites them. More than 60 years after the photos were taken, much of America appears different now. Gently probing, playfully satirical, Shulman and Diop remind us that much remains the same. \u201cIt\u2019s a very contemporary project,\u201d Shulman said. \u201cIt has a lot of relevance to the world we live in today.\u201d \u201cBeing There\u201d is published by Textuel and available now.", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/omar-diop-lee-shulman-being-there/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_style_stegosaurus-fossil-auction-scli-intl-scn", "text": "A Stegosaurus skeleton described as the \u201cmost complete and best preserved\u201d of its kind ever discovered is expected to fetch up to $6 million at auction this summer \u2013 but not everyone is happy about it\ufeff. The \u201cexceptional\u201d and \u201cvirtually complete\u201d dinosaur fossil, which is 11 feet tall and 20 feet long, will be sold as part of Sotheby\u2019s annual Geek Week. Paleontologists have questioned the sale of such specimens to private bidders, arguing that these finds should be preserved in museums or other public spaces. Nevertheless, that will not stop the auction of the 150-million-year-old fossil from going ahead in New York on July 17. Apex, as it has been nicknamed, is the \u201cfinest Stegosaurus specimen to come to market,\u201d Sotheby\u2019s said in a press release Wednesday. It is expected to fetch between $4 million and $6 million, making it one of the most valuable dinosaur fossils ever offered up for sale, the auction house added. Characterized by its distinctive shape, the Stegosaurus was a herbivorous dinosaur with a tiny head and bony plates marching down its back, ending in a spiked tail. A commercial paleontologist named Jason Cooper unearthed Apex on his private land in Colorado, and Sotheby\u2019s said it was involved in the process from the outset. The auction house collaborated closely with Cooper to \u201cdocument the entire process, from discovery and excavation to restoration, preparation, and mounting, ensuring that the documentation and sale of the specimen is handled with the highest standards and transparency.\u201d This collaboration, it said, \u201ccontinues Sotheby\u2019s legacy of pioneering Natural History auctions.\u201d Some, however, see it differently. Steve Brusatte, a professor\u00a0of paleontology and evolution at Scotland\u2019s University of Edinburgh, described the specimen as \u201can important dinosaur fossil,\u201d particularly as there are \u201cfar fewer good (Stegosaurus) skeletons than other famous dinosaurs like T. rex and Triceratops.\u201d This, according to Brusatte, is part of the reason it should not end up in private hands. \u201cIf what the auction house is saying is true, and what I\u2019m seeing in these photos is genuine, then this skeleton really does belong in a museum, where it can be conserved, studied by scientists, and put on display to inspire people from all walks of life,\u201d he said in an email to CNN Thursday. \u201cIt is a great shame when a fossil like this, which could educate and rouse the curiosity of so many people, just disappears into the mansion of an oligarch.\u201d \u201cApex\u201d was discovered in the Morrison Formation in Moffat County, Colorado - and very aptly close to the town of Dinosaur \u2013 in May 2022. It took more than a year to fully excavate the specimen, which was found to have evidence of arthritis, suggesting it lived to an advanced age, with no signs of combat or predation-related injuries. The highest bidder will receive a copy of the dinosaur\u2019s scan data, plus a full license to use any 3D data however they choose. This, according to Sotheby\u2019s, \u201cwill allow primary information about the dinosaur to remain with the specimen and promote collaboration in future research and education.\u201d Brusatte argued, however, that research and education would be best served if the fossil was owned by an institution with an expertise in dinosaurs. \u201cThe uber-wealthy will always be able to outbid museums when a dinosaur is sold on the open market, so my hope is that if there is somebody with the means to buy a fossil like this, and this fossil captures their fancy, that they donate it to a museum,\u201d said Brusatte. \u201cWhat a legacy that would be \u2014 to have your dinosaur on public display, to have your name up in lights as the donor who saved the dinosaur for science, as kids and families stroll by and gawk at this awesome creature from prehistory.\u201d London\u2019s Natural History Museum is home to \u201cSophie,\u201d a comparable fossil - though \u201cApex\u201d is at least 30% bigger, according to Sotheby\u2019s. Cassandra Hatton, Sotheby\u2019s global head of science and popular culture, described Apex as \u201csimply one of the best fossils of its kind ever unearthed.\u201d Visitors to Sotheby\u2019s New York galleries will be able to see Apex as part of a free exhibition of some of the items on sale during Geek Week. Sotheby\u2019s \u201clegacy of pioneering Natural History auctions,\u201d as it refers to it, includes the 2022 sale of an ancient skeleton of a Gorgosaurus, which sold for just over $6 million. It also sold the first standalone T Rex skull with \u201cMaximus\u201d in December 2022. Stan, the world\u2019s most complete Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton, set a new world record in 2020 when it sold for $31.8 million at Christie\u2019s. At the time of sale, paleontologists feared the fossil was lost to science, but in March the Abu Dhabi Department of Culture and Tourism revealed plans for Stan to be a star attraction at a new museum of natural history, expected to open in 2025 in Abu Dhabi, as CNN previously reported.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/style/stegosaurus-fossil-auction-scli-intl-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_style_netflix-docuseries-7m-tiktok-culture-queue", "text": "Over two years ago, a 40-minute-long public plea made on Instagram Live rippled across social media. In the video, TikTok dancer Melanie Wilking and her parents claimed they had lost all contact with her 25-year-old sister, Miranda \u2014 now, Miranda Derrick \u2014 to a \u201creligious organization\u201d and that she was \u201cno longer in control\u201d of her life. Melanie and Miranda had performed together as the Wilking Sisters, but the family said Derrick had disappeared from their lives. She was still living in the public eye, however, including announcing a marriage to fellow dancer James Derrick (known as BDash). Until then, it\u2019s unlikely that Derrick\u2019s millions of followers would have noticed anything amiss, based on her social media accounts. The Los Angeles-based dancer was regularly posting feel-good, polished videos of modern choreography to throwbacks hits with BDash and a small-knit group of fellow dancers and creators. She had walked the red carpet at the American Music Awards in November 2021, and just days before her family shared their video message, appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. But in the time since, reports from multiple publications, including The Cut and Rolling Stone, as well as an ongoing lawsuit, and now, a Netflix documentary, have revealed troubling claims about the mysterious religious organization the Derricks joined, and how it allegedly doubles as a talent management company called 7M Films. In the new three-part docuseries \u201cDancing for the Devil: The 7M TikTok Cult,\u201d the Wilking family is joined by a handful of dancers formerly represented by 7M Films \u2014 who are in civil litigation with its co-owner and CEO, Robert Shinn \u2014 to speak up about their experiences. They include Kevin \u201cKonkrete\u201d Davis, who rose to fame in the dance community alongside BDash, Aubrey Fisher and Kylie Douglas. Davis, Fisher and Douglas collaborated with the Derricks regularly on dance videos during their time with 7M and had amassed millions of combined followers across TikTok and Instagram. Shinn, an LA pastor \u2014 whose son, Isaiah Shinn, films the Derricks\u2019 content \u2014 founded 7M alongside his long-running Shekinah Church; \u201cDancing for the Devil\u201d asserts the two entities are one and the same, with Shinn and his wife, Hannah, enriching themselves from their church members and talent while isolating them from their previous lives. (7M Films made a public statement in 2022 asserting that it is \u201coperate(d) separately and apart\u201d from Shekinah Church.) According to the series, which also features former members of the church, Shinn first began Shekinah as a religious community for Korean Americans, then founded 7M as an off-shoot business for Internet-famous dancers, promising them fame and wealth in addition to religious salvation. First-hand accounts and recordings of Shinn\u2019s sermons detail how he asked members to \u201cdie to\u201d their families, or cut them off, in order to save their loved ones in the afterlife. Wilking, too, had attended dinners hosted by Shinn along with her sister, but, sensing red flags, she declined to go to his invite-only church services, she explained in the series. \u201cIt was an opportunity to tell a story in real time \u2014 an active story that was still unfolding in front of our eyes,\u201d said the docuseries\u2019 director, Derek Doneen, in a video interview with CNN. \u201cBefore we started shooting, the (featured) dancers were still in (the organization).\u201d Many of the people who became subjects in the show were people that we didn\u2019t ever really know if we\u2019d get the opportunity to meet and talk to and feature.\u201d Twin stories, broken families \u201cDancing for the Devil\u201d largely follows the parallel stories of two pairs of sisters who were allegedly separated by Shinn\u2019s organizations: Wilking and Derrick, and Melanie and Priscylla Lee. The latter two joined Shekinah as young immigrants in 1999 and became dependent on it for housing and work (Priscylla has since changed her last name to Leigh). They lost contact for years when Melanie left the church \u2014 with the help of a friend\u00a0 \u2014 and Priscylla stayed. \u201cFor (Melanie Lee) to come forward \u2014 I\u2019m just so appreciative of her strength and trust in us,\u201d said the documentary\u2019s executive producer Jessica Acevedo, explaining that she was initially wary. \u201cShe expressed that she has her sister still in there, and (she) feared for her.\u201d Over the course of production, Priscylla left Shekinah, too, and shared her story. The Shinn family and the Derricks did not participate in the docuseries, though Miranda has stated on social media that she is \u201cnot in a cult.\u201d BDash described 7M as a \u201csecular for profit company run by people who have faith in God,\u201d in his own statement. \u201cIt is their job to manage/control our bookings or schedules\u2026 That is not a cult activity, it\u2019s called doing business.\u201d \u201cIs it wrong for Christians to be involved in a non faith based entertainment business?\u201d he continued. \u201cIf 7M was run by (an) unbeliever, then is it no longer a cult?\u201d The Derricks and a lawyer for Robert and Hannah Shinn did not return CNN\u2019s request for comment. The Derricks have also previously refuted claims that she is being kept from her family, framing the situation instead as a personal family dispute. In 2022, a lawyer for 7M Films told Rolling Stone: \u201cIt is pathetic and contemptible to try to turn her (Miranda\u2019s) private family matters into a tawdry public scandal for clicks and clout.\u201d In 2022, Shinn filed a lawsuit claiming defamation and trade libel against several former church members, including the Lee sisters, that alleges the defendants made \u201cfalse statements\u201d referring to Shinn\u2019s organizations as a cult, and launched a campaign to \u201ccancel\u201d Shinn \u201cthrough flagrant, defamatory attacks on social and other media.\u201d The following year, Davis, Fisher and Douglas, among others, joined a cross-complaint with the former church members against Shinn, his wife, their entities and other affiliated individuals. The claims accuse them of fraud, forced labor and human trafficking, as well as Robert of sexual battery. The case is scheduled to go to trial in July 2025 in Los Angeles; to date, no criminal charges have been filed. Today, Derrick is back in contact with her family, occasionally documenting their holidays together on her social media accounts \u2014 though the docuseries alleges this is mostly for optics, and that she is still close to Shinn. Derrick did not return CNN\u2019s request for comment about this allegation. For members who do leave Shinn\u2019s organizations, the documentary makers learned it\u2019s not an easy path, as they follow Priscylla\u2019s struggle to adapt to a new life outside of the church and her pursuit of justice. \u201cYou don\u2019t come out healed; you don\u2019t come out necessarily disavowing many of the teachings,\u201d Doneen said. \u201cThat was a bit of a learning curve for me to understand. Once you\u2019re out, it is day one of a very long journey \u2014 a very long road to recovery.\u201d \u201cDancing for the Devil: The 7M TikTok Cult\u201d is available on Netflix on May 29.

Snapped while taking a stroll in New York City, the model, writer and actor was seen wearing a graphic T-shirt printed with Stormy Daniels face (Daniels is the adult film star and director who was allegedly paid $130,000 by Trump to keep quiet about an affair ahead of the 2016 election). The\u00a0$95 shirt\u00a0was designed by cartoonist Robert Crumb\u00a0and,\u00a0according to the brand Platform, directly supports the New York based domestic violence and sexual assault organization, \u201cSafe Horizon,\u201d\u00a0by donating a\u00a0portion of its sales. Fashion has long been an important vehicle for political expression, particularly for those in the spotlight. In 1984, British designer Katherine Hammett\u00a0became an early proponent of politically charged T-shirts, when she arrived to meet then British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in a top that read \u201c58% don\u2019t want Pershing\u201d \u2014 a phrase lifted from an\u00a0opinion poll on the undemocratic proliferation of American nuclear missiles across Europe. Hammett later told the Guardian in 2018 she hid the top tightly under her jacket, only exposing the words when she was in front of a wall of cameras. Thatcher bent down to read her shirt and \u201clet out a squawk,\u201d Hammett said. Today, statements can range from the enigmatic to the undeniable. Ratajkowski herself is no stranger to the art of sartorial support, wearing a\u00a0conspicuous\u00a0Rage Against the Machine\u00a0T-shirt\u00a0in 2020\u00a0featuring a young Bernie Sanders. However in 2017,\u00a0while delivering a televised speech on Brexit legislation, the late Queen Elizabeth II \u2014 well versed in the semiotics of clothing \u2014\u00a0wore\u00a0a blue and yellow floral hat\u00a0that many\u00a0interpreted\u00a0as subtle\u00a0homage to the EU flag. Similarly, at the\u00a0Cannes Film Festival\u00a0earlier this month, many online questioned whether Cate Blanchett\u2019s Haider Ackermann dress was a tacit show of solidarity with Palestine amid the war in Gaza. The silk satin haute couture gown was half black and half blush-toned pink, with a striking emerald green lining only visible when she tossed her frock open. In an image captured by an elevated photographer, the pastel pink in Blanchett\u2019s gown appeared\u00a0almost\u00a0white \u2014 a combination of colors, especially considering the red carpet of the Promenade de la Croisette, was enough for some to\u00a0perceive\u00a0as a nod to the\u00a0de\u00a0facto\u00a0Palestinian\u00a0flag. Neither Blanchett nor Ackermann (who made the dress in January 2023,\u00a0some\u00a09 months before the October 7 attacks) issued an official statement on the dress. But in the digital age,\u00a0explicit displays of support are sometimes at risk of being censored. On Wednesday,\u00a0Vanity Fair France issued an apology\u00a0after\u00a0it was revealed that\u00a0the magazine had edited out a Palestinian pin worn by actor Guy Pearce during a photoshoot. \u201cAs the Palestinian people are already suffering great trauma and loss due to the vengeful regime of Netanyahu it is most unfortunate that a reputable publication like VF attempts to eliminate support that I or anyone chooses to offer,\u201d Pearce told CNN in an emailed statement. \u201cPersonally I think it is a disgrace.\u201d Hammett believes the quality of modern protest T-shirts have diminished to \u201cwatered-down messages,\u201d and while there is no striking statistic\u00a0or slogan\u00a0on Ratajkowski\u2019s top,\u00a0there\u2019s poetry in her choice of design.\u00a0Daniels, whose claims were long underestimated because of her career as a sex worker, refused to be pressured by a powerful man into silence. Similarly, Ratajkowski has spoken at length in her 2021 book \u201cMy Body\u201d about her experience enduring several instances of sexual assault. \u201cMy position brought me in close proximity to wealth and power and brought me some autonomy, but it hasn\u2019t resulted in true empowerment,\u201d wrote Ratajkowski in the opening to her book. \u201cThat\u2019s something I\u2019ve gained only now, having written these essays and given voice to what I\u2019ve thought and experienced.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/style/emily-ratajkowski-stormy-daniels-sartorial-support/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_style_franz-kafka-letter-writers-block-auction-intl-scli", "text": "A letter giving a rare insight into Franz Kafka\u2019s struggle with writer\u2019s block is going up for auction. Best-known for the 1915 novella \u201cThe Metamorphosis,\u201d the Prague-born Jewish writer struggled throughout his short life with anxiety, hopelessness and isolation \u2013 themes that came to define his work \u2013 but little has been known about his creative process. The one-page letter, which is expected to sell for \u00a370,000 to \u00a390,000 ($89,000 to $115,000) at Sotheby\u2019s in London, is dated to spring 1920, according to the auction house. This means it would have been written while Kafka was undergoing treatment for tuberculosis, with which he was diagnosed three years earlier. He took intermittent sick leave from his job with an insurance company and would often spend periods at sanatoriums. He retired in 1922 and died in a clinic near Vienna two years later. \u201cI haven\u2019t written anything for three years, what\u2019s published now are old things, I don\u2019t have any other work, not even started,\u201d Kafka lamented in the letter, written in German and addressed to his friend, the Austrian poet Albert Ehrenstein. Giving a reason for this literary dry spell, Kafka wrote: \u201cWhen worries have penetrated to a certain layer of inner existence, writing and complaining obviously cease, indeed my resistance was not too strong.\u201d The letter was written in response to Ehrenstein asking him to contribute to his magazine, Sotheby\u2019s said in a media statement issued Monday. Ehrenstein made the request after seeing a newly published work by Kafka \u2013 probably the 1919 short story collection \u201cEin Landarzt\u201d (\u201cA Country Doctor\u201d). \u201cThe life and works of Franz Kafka have long been a source of fascination throughout the world,\u201d Sotheby\u2019s Books & Manuscripts specialist Gabriel Heaton said in the release. \u201cThe letter reveals how writing made intense demands on him, and required deep reserves of inner strength, as he grappled with deep insecurity and worry about the futility of his work. We can also all be thankful that Kafka would continue to pick up his pen despite his crippling writer\u2019s block,\u201d he added. At the time the letter was written, Kafka had also begun an intense love affair with Czech journalist and writer Milena Jesensk\u00e1. So, despite his physical health continuing to decline, Kafka was given renewed confidence with Jesensk\u00e1\u2019s support and was able to begin his final literary endeavors, including \u201cA Hunger Artist\u201d and \u201cThe Castle,\u201d according to the release. Both these books were published posthumously, in 1924 and 1926, respectively \u2013 despite Kafka requesting that his unpublished manuscripts be destroyed upon his death. Though he was sought out by avant-garde publishers during his life, Kafka\u2019s greatest literary acclaim came posthumously. His works, all written in German, were rediscovered in Germany and Austria after 1945, and he began to have a huge influence on German literature that extended globally by the 1960s. They have been widely adapted for the cinema, TV and theater.

The complex was decorated with painted plaster, mosaics and there was a collection of tiny, tightly-coiled lead scrolls suggesting some sort of ritual or pilgrimage might have taken place there, according to a press release. The villa in Grove would have been \u201ccentral for this area of Oxfordshire,\u201d Francesca Giarelli, project officer for Red River Archaeology Group and the site\u2019s director, told CNN on Thursday. She described a building that likely had multiple levels. The structure, which stretched across 1,000 square meters (10,800 square feet) on just the ground floor, was probably visible for miles, Giarelli added. Hundreds of coins, plus rings, brooches, mosaic tesserae and painted plaster with floral motifs have been uncovered during the year-long excavation, allowing archaeologists to pinpoint a long period of Roman activity at the site from the 1st or 2nd century into the late 4th or early 5th century. Archaeologists also discovered an aisled building, a bigger and more impressive hall-like structure built after the villa once the family that owned it became richer over time, Giarelli said. In Roman times, villas were not simply residential dwellings but more like \u201csmall administrative centers,\u201d Giarelli explained, often with responsibilities for maintaining roads, planning the crops surrounding it and acting as a \u201csafe space\u201d to store food products during unstable times. Even in the late Roman period, this particular villa continued to show signs of human activity. A horse-headed buckle, dated to 350-450 AD, suggests the presence of late Roman elites or someone who still wished to be associated with that period, though such buckles can also be associated with early Anglo-Saxon burials, archaeologists said in a statement to CNN. Excavating the site, described as \u201cremarkable\u201d in a press statement, began before the housing developers Barratt and David Wilson Homes started their building work and after two evaluation trenches had been dug. The trenches revealed a \u201chigh potential for archaeological presence,\u201d Giarelli said, prompting an archaeological investigation, which began two months before the building work and is still ongoing. The site still holds some mysteries to unravel in the continuing excavations.  Archaeologists haven\u2019t yet found \u201cwhere all the people ended up,\u201d Giarelli said, though they believe there is a burial somewhere on the site, and there have been some artifacts, such as the lead scrolls, that point toward a sanctuary present, but still hidden underground.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/28/style/roman-villa-development-oxfordshire-intl-scli-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_style_julie-satow-department-stores-fifth-avenue-women", "text": "Before the nationwide influx of suburban malls and the convenience of online shopping, there was a golden age of American department stores. More than merely local shopping hubs, these ostentatious emporiums offered tea rooms, child care, beauty services and exotic animals for sale, if you could afford a pet monkey or a baby puma. Though the buildings belonged to billionaire men, it was women who strategized and oversaw the commercial and cultural success of some of the biggest and best department stores in America: Hortense Odlum at Bonwit Teller, Dorothy Shaver at Lord & Taylor and Geraldine Stutz at Henri Bendel among them. This trio are among the subjects of Julie Satow\u2019s new book, \u201cWhen Women Ran Fifth Avenue: Glamour and Power at the Dawn of American Fashion.\u201d As Satow illustrates, department stores were places where women gathered, gossiped and dreamed of more luxurious lives.\u00a0In Europe, there was Harrods (or Liberty) in London and Le Bon Marche Rive Gauche in Paris \u2014 stores that had established the culture of shopping as an event, buzzing with a life of their own. And from the Depression era through to the swinging Sixties in New York, Odlum, Shaver and Stutz built their domains into similar fashion and cultural destinations. Satow knits their stories together to explore how the evolution of department stores reflected the changing values of women as business leaders, how closely our identities are tied to where we shop (and what we buy) and how the role of humans is integral to the experience of shopping \u2014 or, perhaps, any service industry threatened by automatization. \u201cWhen department stores originally opened, (they represented) one of the rare opportunities for women to congregate together in public,\u201d\u00a0Satow told CNN. \u201cIt was almost a fantasy world, and a place for women to come together for advice and a sense of community. Shopping was a sentient, sensual experience.\u201d Even for those on the other side of the counter, it was momentous: Employment gave many women their first taste of independence, and aspirations to careers in retail, fashion and hospitality. And the stores also offered something much greater to the women Satow profiles. In a period in which it was nearly impossible for women to pursue business leadership, independently or at all, Odlum, Shaver and Stutz were largely unsung pioneers. \u201cNone of these women have biographies,\u201d Satow noted. \u201cDorothy Shaver paved the way for many other women who rose through the ranks in the retail industry. She broke so many ceilings in terms of women at work\u2026 In 1947, she was named \u2018the No. 1 career woman\u2019 in TIME magazine, which was a rarity.\u201d That year, Shaver was overseeing a $40 million business, and by the time she died in 1959 \u2014 still president of Lord & Taylor to the end \u2014 annual sales had reached $100 million. Shaver was also a founding member of the organization of women within the American fashion\u00a0industry, Fashion Group (now known as the Fashion Group International) alongside\u00a0Elizabeth Arden\u00a0and\u00a0Helena Rubinstein in 1930, and the architect of the \u201cAmerican Look,\u201d which in the 1940s transformed the national fashion industry and instilled a sense of pride in less restrictive, affordable American clothing, the forerunner of modern sportswear. Until that point, American women had become accustomed to buying European fashion or cheaper, locally produced copies of what appeared on Parisian runways. \u201cWomen running department stores (had) an innate understanding that men lacked,\u201d Satow explained. \u201cHortense Odlum was very much trying to make the department store a welcoming place\u2026 She saw herself as a hostess, in a way.\u201d (Odlum\u2019s perspective was, in large part, driven by her own experiences; until her husband\u2019s law career flourished with the couple\u2019s move to New York, she had been all-too-budgeted in her fashion choices and all-too-conscious of clothes as a status symbol. Her motivation was to make department stores enticing \u2014 and accessible \u2014 for women of all means.) And Geraldine Stutz, who transitioned into the retail business after roles in fashion media, implemented concepts still relevant to the industry today. Henri Bendel recruited her in 1964 as a last ditch attempt to save their store from bankruptcy \u2014 there, \u201cshe originated the boutique experience that we still see today, including the divisions of brands within a store,\u201d Satow said. Within three years, Stutz had doubled sales; she was elected to the Fashion Industry Hall of Fame in 1985. \u201cAll three women created a special atmosphere and ambiance within their stores. Today, shopping is not nearly as immersive and experiential as it was,\u201d Satow explained. \u201cI think there is a nostalgia for the golden era of the department store, and it is always bittersweet when an era like that ends,\u201d she continued. \u201cNow, with everything from Etsy to TikTok, nearly anyone with (the) will and a small budget can start their own brand. The opportunities department stores afforded women are less critical than they once were.\u201d Add to queue: Shop it like it\u2019s hot Read: \u201cThe Women In Black\u201d by Madeleine St. John (1993) This novel is set within the fictional F.G. Goode department store in 1950s Sydney, Australia. The titular women in black are the saleswomen, whose personal and professional dramas intersect as they weather the politics of the womenswear department. Considered an Australian classic, the book has been translated onto the big screen and stage. Watch: \u201cMannequin\u201d (1987) In this quintessentially \u201880s cult classic, Kim Cattrall plays, wait for it, a mannequin seemingly dreamed into life by jack-of-all-trades Jonathan Switcher (Andrew McCarthy). The pair build a partnership, both professionally \u2014 staging attention-grabbing window displays at a failing department store \u2014 and romantically. The catch to this love story: Emmy only comes to life for Jonathan. Is it ridiculous and campy? Of course, but Hollywood Montrose would have it no other way. Read: \u201cThe Dallergut Dream Department Store\u201d (2024) A bestseller in Korea, the debut novel (and first of a two-book series) from author Miye Lee weaves a fantastical narrative around, as its title suggests, a department store selling consumers\u2019 perfect dreams. In lieu of traditional store floors and sections like womenswear or home furnishings, shoppers can browse well-curated dream worlds \u2014 nostalgia, travel, fantasy and even nightmare \u2014 to find the perfect fit for their slumber; promoting the value of bedtime like any good sleep salesman would, the book also highlights the importance of quality shut-eye on the subconscious. Watch: \u201cThe Devil and Miss Jones\u201d (1941) It was common practice in department stores of the 1930s and 40s to employ undercover shoppers and in-store detectives to keep an eye on both customers and employees, identifying union organizers in particular \u2014 as American workers today are increasingly looking to unions to combat stagnant wages and layoffs, the 1941 film \u201cThe Devil and Miss Jones\u201d feels remarkably prescient. Its plot sees John P. Merrick (Charles Coburn) as the New York retail tycoon who pretends to be a shoe clerk at one of his stores where he suspects his workers are attempting to form a union, opposite Mary Jones (Jean Arthur) as the captivating salesgirl who somehow wins her boss over to sympathizing with their cause.

And now, as stars Nicola Coughlan and Luke Newton, who play love interests Penelope Featherington and Colin Bridgerton (Polin, to the shippers), promote the remaining episodes, Coughlan is pulling out all the sartorial stops to match the romance of the season. At the Toronto red-carpet premiere earlier this week, Coughlan stepped out in a structured lavender mini dress rippling with petal-like silk organza, paired with a voluminous red gathered cloak fit for early 19th-century yearning. The couture ensemble is by designer Sara Mrad and served as another example of Coughlan\u2019s stylist, Aim\u00e9e Croysdill, playing up the Irish actress\u2019s curves with exaggerated silhouettes. Coughlan has long been admired for her bold red-carpet looks \u2014 including her debut at the Met Gala in 2022 in an extravagant pink and black Richard Quinn ball gown \u2014 but she\u2019s amplified her style on her \u201cBridgerton\u201d press tour. In April, she glimmered at a London event in a sculptural 22-karat gold-plated corset by MISHO that featured an anatomical heart. Last month, she wore a dramatic white peplum hourglass gown by Danielle Frankel to the New York premiere. (Nearly all her looks have also been accessorized with a red pin that signals her support for a ceasefire in Palestine, too). This season has been a milestone for her character Penelope, who takes the spotlight at court, and Coughlan. As the former \u201cDerry Girls\u201d actor has stepped into the role of leading lady, she\u2019s intentional about how she wants to be portrayed. \u201cThere\u2019s one scene where I\u2019m very naked on camera, and that was my idea, my choice. It just felt like the biggest \u2018f*** you\u2019 to all the conversation surrounding my body; it was amazingly empowering,\u201d she told Stylist magazine earlier this year, which was reported on by BuzzFeed. And though Coughlan\u2019s power dressing can speak for itself, the actor has been candid with her fans about what\u2019s appropriate and what isn\u2019t, writing on Instagram earlier this year that \u201cit\u2019s really hard to take the weight of thousands of opinions on how you look being sent directly to you every day.\u201d But she\u2019s also responded with wit that rivals Penelope\u2019s. At the Dublin premiere, she was asked about her \u201cbravery\u201d in showing her body on screen. She replied: \u201cYou know it is hard because I think women with my body type \u2013\u2014 women with perfect breasts \u2014 don\u2019t get to see ourselves on screen enough.\u201d \u201cI hope you enjoy them,\u201d she added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/style/nicola-coughlan-bridgerton-lotw/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}

And it\u2019s now been sold at auction for more than $700,000. \u201cOften mistakenly referred to as a door, the ornate structure was in reality part of the door frame just above the first-class lounge entrance,\u201d Heritage Auctions wrote in the auction notes. The prop\u2019s pivotal role in the \u201cbig scene, big goodbye\u201d moment, as the auction house had described it, features Rose floating on the floral-carved panel as Jack, having tried and failed to also rest atop, has succumbed to the cold. As a rescue boat arrives, Rose is forced to pry her hand from his frozen grip \u2014 while uttering the famous line \u201cI\u2019ll never let go, I promise,\u201d through chattering teeth \u2014 as she swims to her rescuers. The ornate balsa wood panel had previously been displayed at a Planet Hollywood in Orlando, Florida before being stored in their archives for some two decades, the auction house told CNN. It was sold alongside a roster of other props at the \u201cTreasures From Planet Hollywood\u201d auction, which included memorabilia items once displayed at Planet Hollywood locations worldwide and from its archives. These included pieces such as the whip from\u00a0\u201cIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\u201d and the ax from \u201cThe Shining.\u201d Across almost 1,600 lots in total, the five-day-long auction brought in $15.7 million, according\u00a0to a press release. But the \u201cTitanic\u201d flotsam took the prize for the highest-priced piece, far exceeding its starting price of $40,000 and selling for a grand total of $718,750 following a high-energy bidding war. Several other \u201cTitanic\u201d props were also put up for sale, including the pastel chiffon evening gown Rose wears in the movie on the night of the sinking and the ship\u2019s helm wheel, which sold for $118,750 and $200,000 respectively. A 2012 episode of the Discovery show \u201cMythBusters\u201d infamously found that two people could have survived long enough on the panel \u2014 which measures approximately eight feet (2.4 meters) long and just over three feet (1 meter) wide \u2014 if they added a life jacket for extra buoyancy. Remarking on the results, however, \u201cTitanic\u201d director James Cameron told the show\u2019s hosts, Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage, that Jack needed to die regardless. And in 2022, Cameron, alongside a hypothermia expert, tried to put an end to the debate once and for all with a\u00a0simulated test\u00a0to see if two people of the same body mass as Winslet and DiCaprio could have really stayed afloat on a piece of wood of the same size. Their final answer was no, it was not possible. There was no additional testing of these theories on the prop itself prior to its sale, as the auction house chooses to \u201chandle all items with great care when in transit and in storage,\u201d Heritage Auctions told CNN. But its new owner, who is choosing to remain anonymous, could well be planning a pool day, having been drawn in by the allure of the over two-decade-long mystery. \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is this massive interest in the films of the 1980s and 1990s,\u201d said Joe Maddalena, executive vice president of Heritage Auctions, in a statement. \u201cThere has been a generational shift to where these massive franchises of the 1980s and 1990s \u2014 the \u2018Home Alone\u2019s, the \u2018Indiana Jones\u2019 films, the \u2018Die Hard\u2019s \u2014 are now collectors\u2019 favorites\u2026 Collectors are finally rewarding these artifacts as what they are: cultural artifacts akin to the fine art of old.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/style/titanic-door-prop-auction-planet-hollywood/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}

Representing Bulacan, a province to the north of Manila, Manalo beat out 52 other contestants from around the archipelago and overseas. The competition was held at the SM Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay. As the competition narrowed down to the top five finalists, Manalo was asked on stage how she would use her beauty and confidence to empower others. \u201cAs a woman of color, I have always faced challenges in my life. I was told that beauty has standards, actually,\u201d she said, adding that she was taught to \u201cbelieve in my mother, to always believe in yourself, uphold the vows that you have.\u201d \u201cBecause of these, I am already influencing a lot of women who are facing me right now,\u201d she said, gazing out to the packed arena. Manalo\u2019s win is part of a wider conversation about diversifying notions of beauty in the Philippines, a country where certain Western ideals have long persisted, shaped in part by the country\u2019s colonial past. Lighter-skinned actors and models typically star in major TV shows, movies and fashion campaigns and as common in other Asian countries, skin lightening treatments and products are pervasive. Manalo, who began modeling at 14, described her own insecurities growing up, in a YouTube video on Empire Philippines, which livestreamed the event. \u201cI grew up having insecurities as I was always bullied because of my skin and my hair type,\u201d she said, crediting her friends and family for helping her \u201crealize that I am beautiful in my own extraordinary way.\u201d Manalo will represent the Philippines in the Miss Universe pageant to be held in Mexico in September. She is vying to earn the fifth title for the country, following the footsteps of Gloria Diaz in 1969, Margie Moran in 1973, and Pia Wurtzbach in 2015 (after host Steve Harvey initially declared the wrong winner.)

This year will see the competition remove any upper age limit set for its contestants \u2014 previously, those competing were required to be between the age of 18 and 28.

{"id": "2024_03_29_style_kim-kardashian-donald-judd-furniture-cec", "text": "Kim Kardashian\u2019s oft-divisive interior design aesthetic is under new scrutiny. The estate of minimalist contemporary artist Donald Judd filed a lawsuit against Kardashian this week, claiming the fashion and beauty mogul promoted \u201ccheap knockoffs\u201d of his furniture designs. The basis of the suit is a 2022 video Kardashian posted to YouTube, in which she gives a guided tour of the offices for her then-brand new makeup company, Skkn by Kim. (The video, which the suit alleged received some 3.7 million views, was seemingly made private following the lawsuit filing.) While touting her office\u2019s minimalist design, Kardashian specifically praises a sleek, large-scale wooden table with a set of matching chairs that are perfectly sized to slide beneath \u2014 creating a piece resembling less a dining table and more a brutalist sculpture. \u201cThese Donald Judd tables are really amazing and totally blend in with the seats,\u201d Kardashian says, moving a chair out to show the camera. An artist and sculptor, Judd was known for his minimalist designs emphasizing clean whole shapes and industrial materials. As they appear in the video, the table and its matching chairs in Kardashian\u2019s office resemble Judd\u2019s famous La Mansana Table and Chair 84 \u2014 pieces that have become iconic among furniture designers and collectors since they were first produced in 1982. The Judd Foundation still manufactures and sells these designs, though they come at a cost: the table is priced at $90,000, while the chairs retail for $9,000 each. But Kardashian\u2019s wares were not authentic pieces, the Judd Foundation wrote in the lawsuit filed Wednesday against both Kardashian and Clements Design, the interior design firm she worked with in designing the Skkn office space. (And even if they were, the foundation \u201ccategorically prohibits customers from using purchased Donald Judd furniture for marketing and promotional purposes,\u201d it says in its court filing.) The foundation is claiming trademark infringement, copyright infringement, unfair competition, false advertising and false endorsement of the knockoff items. \u201cConsumers who watched the video or read the media coverage were misled to believe Ms. Kardashian\u2019s tables and chairs were authentic Donald Judd pieces,\u201d the foundation states in the filing. It is seeking the profits it argues Kardashian and Clements Design made off the use of Judd\u2019s name. Clements Designs, according to the court filing, said it never claimed the tables and chairs were authentic Judd pieces, and directed the foundation to settle the issue with Kardashian. In a statement provided to CNN, the design firm said the pieces it produced for Kardashian\u2019s office had \u201cobvious key differences\u201d to Judd\u2019s designs. \u201cThe Judd Foundation\u2019s prior counsel acknowledged these differences and since then, we have not heard from them in over a year, and are now being blindsided with a lawsuit,\u201d Clements Design\u2019s statement read. \u201cEfforts were made to resolve this issue amicably at the time and the Judd Foundation was unwilling to settle on reasonable terms. These claims have absolutely no merit.\u201d To add further insult, Kardashian\u2019s knockoffs were also, the lawsuit claims, seemingly made from plywood \u2014 a material that the Judd Foundation does not authorize.\u201d \u201cThese poor-quality imitations masquerading as authentic Donald Judd tables and chairs harm the Donald Judd brand,\u201d the lawsuit argues. \u201cConsumers will see the cheap knockoffs\u2026 and erroneously associate (the) low-grade pieces with the Donald Judd brand,\u201d the lawsuit states. The foundation claimed it also offered to replace the counterfeit tables and chairs with authentic pieces at a discount if Kardashian issued a retraction and edited the video, the lawsuit claims. Representatives for Kardashian offered to promote the Judd Foundation in a social media post, which the foundation rejected, and also offered to issue a retraction in the video caption, but not remove the video, the lawsuit claims. Kardashian did not respond to requests for comment from CNN. Judd, who died in 1994, was very selective about who was allowed to manufacture and carry his designs, paying particularly close attention to the quality of materials used. Only a few galleries and stores \u2014 like the MoMA Design store and the Salon 94 gallery, both in New York \u2014 are authorized to sell his furniture.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/29/style/kim-kardashian-donald-judd-furniture-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments.

The move, which was quickly called out on social media, has been labeled by some as an attempt at censorship. \u201cAs the Palestinian people are already suffering great trauma and loss due to the vengeful regime of Netanyahu it is most unfortunate that a reputable publication like VF attempts to eliminate support that I or anyone chooses to offer,\u201d Pearce told CNN in an emailed statement. \u201cPersonally I think it is a disgrace.\u201d Pearce was featured in Vanity Fair France last week as part of a series of actor portraits at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival, which wrapped its 11-day stint on May 25 and where Pearce was supporting his new film \u201cThe Shrouds.\u201d Featured alongside stars like Sebastian Stan and\u00a0Bella Hadid, Pearce sported a black Yves Saint Laurent suit in his portrait, smiling straight at the camera. But social media sleuths detected an issue. A small Palestinian flag pin, which Pearce had been wearing on his lapel throughout Cannes, was missing from the photograph, though a different photo, featuring the pin, was posted to the magazine\u2019s Instagram the same day the article published. A white, red, black and green bracelet \u2014 the colors of the Palestinian flag \u2014 was still visible on his wrist. The sleuthing went viral on sites like X and TikTok, prompting the magazine to replace the un-edited photo and issue a correction to the article. An apology was also posted to social media on Sunday. \u201cWe have published by mistake a modified version of this photo on the site,\u201d the magazine wrote in French on X in response to a viral post criticizing the edited photo. \u201cThe original version was posted on Instagram the same day. We have rectified our mistake and we apologize.\u201d It\u2019s unclear why a modified version of the picture existed in the first place. Cond\u00e9 Nast, Vanity Fair\u2019s parent company, did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Following the controversy, Pearce also reiterated his support for the Palestinian cause in a post on X, writing \u201cPalestinians are being murdered as we speak. Displaced, traumatised, ruined. The lives and futures of Palestinian children are being eradicated by a vengeful tyrant.\u201d Since October, more than 36,000 people in Gaza have been killed, according to the Ministry of Health in the enclave. Israel\u2019s military operation in Gaza started after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. Last weekend, Israel launched an airstrike on a refugee camp in Rafah, killing at least 45 people. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the civilian deaths a \u201ctragic error\u201d but would not cease the war, despite international condemnation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/style/vanity-fair-france-guy-pearce-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_06_02_style_tschabalala-self-artist-painting-black-bodies", "text": "Both a source of inspiration and a place to ground herself, Harlem holds a special meaning for the artist Tschabalala Self. \u201cIt definitely sculpted my personal worldview,\u00a0style and perspective,\u201d said Self of the Manhattan neighborhood, her hometown, famed for fostering generations of Black creatives, artists and intellectuals. \u201cIt\u2019s this world within the world of New York, the largest and most vibrant city in the world. I\u2019ve always been very proud to be from Harlem.\u201d This pride is most recently manifested in her latest exhibition, \u201cAround the Way,\u201d currently on show at the Espoo Museum of Modern Art, Finland. The show\u2019s title is a nod to Black American slang, referring \u201cto someone who\u2019s from our neighborhood,\u201d she told CNN. From referencing the brownstone brick-patterned architecture to real-life friends, family and local residents, the works on display serve as Self\u2019s homage \u2014 and tribute \u2014 to her Harlem. Self has become known in particular, perhaps, for featuring fuller figured Black women in her artworks, and incorporating sewn fabric and printmaking techniques. The Black female body is \u201cmy visual language, my visual aesthetic,\u201d she explained. \u201cThat\u2019s my muse.\u201d Her work has been shown at institutions including MoMA PS1 in New York City, LA\u2019s Hammer Museum, and London\u2019s Parasol unit \u2014 and on numerous occasions in Harlem-based galleries. As a multidisciplinary creative, she works across fields including sculpture, performance, fashion and more, and is also as editor-in-chief at arts and visual culture magazine Elephant. Yet she\u2019s most at home describing herself as a painter, and credits her training in printmaking as heavily influencing her practice. \u201cI personally think of painting as being more of a philosophy than a literal application of paint,\u201d she said of her work, which is rooted in how different colors relate to each other. This relationship can then be replicated through other mixed media, including fabrics. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to think about new and innovative ways to approach painting\u2026 I describe it more as assemblage because the fabric is so dimensional,\u201d she explained of the appliqu\u00e9 techniques in which she works with fabrics on stretched canvas. \u201cSimilar to how other painters have a palette, I have hundreds of bits and scraps of fabrics\u2026 It\u2019s basically an accumulation of all my different fragmented memories or impressions from individuals that I knew well, or that I just happened upon,\u201d she continued. \u201c\u201cThrough the formal aspects of my work, I\u2019m able to address my central conceptual concern that one\u2019s identity is really the sum of many parts. Some of these parts are inherent, but others are projected and collected.\u201d This sense of collecting and gathering is epitomized in a piece in the new show, titled \u201cAnthurium.\u201d The work blends sewn, painted and printed elements to create a scene of domesticity \u2014 a key focal point of Self\u2019s work previously explored in her \u201cHome Body\u201d series, which depicted scenes of intimacy and interiority. Self\u2019s own relationship with the concept of home has evolved in recent years. Now based in upstate New York, the process of leaving her childhood home prompted her to investigate the significance of domestic spaces, both real and imagined. \u201cI think that the home is an actual site, but it also occupies an emotional and psychological space in people\u2019s minds,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s symbolic of something other than what it really is in reality, and those are the kind of environments I like to explore in my artwork.\u201d When considering Self\u2019s body of work on display in \u201cAround the Way,\u201d and more broadly, it\u2019s also clear that the physical body embodies a further exploration of \u201chome\u201d as a place of belonging, of community and of self-care. Her figures are as at home in their physicality as they are  in the world. She describes her approach to rendering and depicting Black women in particular as \u201can instinct,\u201d but she says that she was able to articulate this further through researching the significance of the Rubenesque figure. \u201cIt was interesting to me that the women had this physical aesthetic that was speaking to their abundance and plentitude. They did not have any need,\u201d she said. In her own practice then, this sense of abundance shows up in the way Self\u2019s characters boldly claim space within the picture frame, with their power rooted in their identity, femininity and physicality. This conversation with the traditional western canon of painting is ongoing for Self, and influences other facets of her work. In March 2024, Self was awarded the prestigious public art commission for London\u2019s Fourth Plinth \u2014 her sculpture, \u201cLady in Blue,\u201d will sit atop one of the plinths in Trafalgar Square, a landmark and tourist destination in the city also renowned for its commitment to highlighting contemporary art, starting in 2026. The piece will be a bronze statue of a Black woman striding in movement forward, wearing a bright blue dress. That color was inspired by lapis lazuli and ultramarine, a rare pigment used with significance in the western art canon. \u201cA lot of classical paintings have used lapis lazuli to denote a sense of honor and prestige to a revered figure. I wanted to use this color\u2026 to bestow that same significance.\u201d \u201cEspecially being an American artist, I think it\u2019s a great honor and I feel a lot of trust from the people of London,\u201d Self said. In thinking about the concept for \u201cLady in Blue,\u201d Self considered the increased attention on monuments, particularly in recent years. Instead of uplifting or exalting individuals, her preferred approach is to look to symbolic representations of shared identities and societies instead. But the commission also represents much more than the sculpture\u2019s identity or physicality alone, added the artist. \u201cIt\u2019s about having a figure that can simultaneously speak to the future and the past, and I honestly feel like a Black female figure is the best figure to do that for a number of cultural and historical reasons. \u2018Lady in Blue\u2019 can be seen as an historical mother, but also as a representation of our collective future.\u201d Tschabalala Self: Around the Way is presented in collaboration with the Saastamoinen Foundation at EMMA\u2013Espoo Museum of Modern Art from 8 May 2024 - 5 May 2025 as part of the In Collection exhibition series.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/style/tschabalala-self-artist-painting-black-bodies/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_style_india-elections-purple-voter-ink-intl-hnk", "text": "India\u2019s massive, twice-a-decade exercise in democracy is once again leaving its mark on the country\u2019s people, in the form of purple-streaked index fingers. The Election Commission uses indelible ink, or \u201cvoter ink\u201d, to prevent fraud or duplicate votes. Once a voter arrives at the booth to cast their ballot and has their ID verified, the ink is painted across the top of their left index finger, leaving a stain that can take up to two weeks to wash off. It may be rudimentary, but the method has been so effective that it\u2019s been in place for more than seven decades. \u201cRight from the prime minister to the most common person, everybody flashes their (marked) finger,\u201d said K Mohammed Irfan, managing director of Mysore Varnish and Paints Limited (MVPL), the state-owned company that exclusively makes and distributes the liquid to polling booths across the nation. \u201cFrom celebrities to film stars\u2026 (it has become) a mark of democracy that I think is synonymous with elections,\u201d he told CNN in a video interview. More than 960 million people are eligible to vote in India\u2019s election, the world\u2019s biggest. And workers at the company\u2019s factory in Mysuru, a city in southwestern Karnataka state, have spent months preparing nearly 2.7 million ink\u00a0vials, its largest order to date. The orange containers were filled and carefully packed for distribution ahead of this year\u2019s elections, which are underway and end\u00a0June 1. Each vial contains enough liquid to mark approximately 700 voters. The key to the ink\u2019s literal staying power? A tightly guarded formula which has remained unchanged since 1951. \u201cIndelible ink serves no other purpose,\u201d said Irfan. \u201cWe only manufacture the required quantity.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0While Irfan says the company is \u201cbound to secrecy\u201d when it comes to the ink\u2019s exact composition, it does contain the chemical compound silver nitrate, which causes a purplish stain when it comes into contact with skin and is exposed to sunlight. One dab at a time When newly independent India held its first-ever general elections in 1951 and 1952, organizers turned to the idea of using indelible ink to mark voters, in efforts to ensure a fair ballot. \u201cIn a country where there was no systematic registration of births, or identity documents, and with millions of people on the move as refugees, the question of how to prevent impersonation and double voting was a source of great concern,\u201d said Ornit Shani, author of \u201cHow India Became Democratic: Citizenship and the Making of the Universal Franchise.\u201d Some officials thought the method would take too much time and complicate the voting process, according to Shani, but public opinion eventually won out. \u201cCombined with the practice that all voters, irrespective of their caste, class and religions would stand in the same line, (having to wait) for their turn to have their finger marked (before they) cast their vote, further contributed to making concrete and visible the core value of the equality of the vote,\u201d Shani said in an email to CNN. \u201cOne man, one woman, one vote.\u201d Lasting appeal MVPL was founded as a paint supplier in 1937 by the then maharaja or ruler of Mysore, Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV, and retains that side\u00a0of its business. According to Irfan, when the company isn\u2019t producing ink, it\u2019s supplying, among other products, paint for the public transport sector. The ink\u2019s appeal has spilled beyond India\u2019s borders too. The company now supplies indelible ink to more than 35 countries, including to Ghana beginning in the late 1970s. However, Ghana\u2019s election commission recently announced it would phase out the use of indelible ink, opting for biometric verification methods instead. But the use of the ink in India doesn\u2019t appear to be going away any time soon. For Mukulika Banerjee, an associate professor of anthropology at the London School of Economics, the practice of marking a body may not translate well in other cultures, but it works in India due to common\u00a0cultural practices. \u201cPeople routinely have their hands decorated with henna, or women have their feet decorated with different colors,\u201d said Banerjee in a phone interview. \u201cI would argue that the marking of the finger (semi-permanently) kind of fits into it in a way that it might not fit in other contexts.\u201d She also pointed to an unintentional effect of marking voters with ink: creating an environment of peer pressure. Banerjee was able to find instances of this during her research on democracy and elections in West Bengal. \u201cFirst thing on polling day people do is check out each other\u2019s fingers,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if your left index finger is not carrying the indelible mark, they\u2019ll look at you and the first thing they\u2019ll say is \u2018Why haven\u2019t you voted?\u2019 \u201cYou can make excuses, but by the fifth time in the day, if somebody asks you and it gets so annoying, it\u2019s actually easier to go and vote than to not vote.\u201d The peer pressure extends to movie stars and athletes, who are likely to post their ink-stained fingers to their millions of fans on social media. \u201cThese guys have begun to hold up (their fingers) and take selfies of having voted and say \u2018I\u2019ve voted, have you?\u2019 because they feel they have a civic duty to encourage others to vote as well,\u201d she added. \u201cSo it becomes aspirational; then you want to be like your hero and you want to be able to do the same thing.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/india-elections-purple-voter-ink-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_style_how-the-super-rich-ship-their-cars", "text": "Ameerh Naran is relentlessly international. Born and raised in Zimbabwe to an Indian family of shoemakers, he once became Harare\u2019s first importer of sex toys. After going on to make millions in private aviation (his planes have been used by celebrities, politicians and on \u201cKeeping Up With The Kardashians\u201d), he now spends most of his time in Dubai and London \u2014 which can present logistical challenges for driving his fleet of cars. \u201cI have a rare Porsche Carrera GT that cost me \u00a31.5m ($1.9m) and I keep it at the airport in Dubai,\u201d says Naran, whose company, Vimana Private Jets, also has offices in Los Angeles and New York. \u201cIf I fly anywhere, Emirates will put it on the earliest flight to wherever I\u2019m going so my car meets me there.\u201d Naran, who\u2019s 38, is one of thousands of wealthy car owners who think little of buying plane tickets for their automobiles, taking advantage of specialist freight services for cars that many of the major airlines offer, particularly those based in the Middle East. An ecosystem of car transport specialists has evolved to work with the airlines and the family offices of the ultra-rich so that favored vehicles magically follow them around the globe. It\u2019s traditionally a busy time of year for these services as the richest residents of the Gulf states prepare to jet off to cooler climes for the summer after Ramadan. The last time Naran flew his Porsche from Dubai to London on Emirates, he says it cost \u00a328,000 ($36,000) \u2014 a little more than he could have paid after landing for a brand-new Golf at a West London Volkswagen dealership. But then serious car guys tend not to want to be seen in family hatchbacks. \u201cI also have jet clients who are very wealthy and less price sensitive than me and don\u2019t want to put their cars on commercial airlines, in which case they\u2019ll charter a cargo plane from us, which costs in the millions,\u201d Naran tells me from Cape Town where\u2019s he\u2019s just arrived for a wedding, without the need for a car. The ultra-wealthy will often take whole fleets of cars with them when they travel, loading vehicles, along with motorbikes and other toys, onto chartered cargo aircraft that follow their private jets. Covered trucks are used to complete journeys to clients\u2019 addresses or garages; owners baulk at the idea of random delivery drivers adding mileage to their beloved cars. Naran says his richest clients barely blink at such excesses; one recently chartered a cargo plane to be ready to fly straight away when his newly acquired Samsung TV wouldn\u2019t fit through the door of his own jet. Rare cars can be worth millions, but not always. \u201cI have one client who transports a Nissan Patrol 4x4\u201d Naran says. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that it\u2019s worth anything, but he likes it and it\u2019s costing him millions to fly it around with his Bugatti.\u201d Dan Hallworth started shipping cars about 15 years ago after cutting his teeth at his uncle\u2019s freight firm in Manchester, England, after finishing school. Back then he says most of the business was in the summer and tended to involve cars coming from the Middle East to London. Newspapers used to be full of reports of hypercars roaring around chichi parts of the British capital at the hands of Qatari princes who cared little for speed limits or the parking fines they collected outside luxury department store Harrods. Hallworth, who says he can send a car between Dubai and London for around \u00a310,000 ($13,000) on cheaper airlines, says the market has changed since then. Police and councils in London started to clampdown on the showiest drivers, and viral videos of watch muggings and other crimes have put many of his clients off London. \u201cNow they go skiing and everything like that and it\u2019s much more all-year-round,\u201d says Hallworth, whose company, Dan Car Logistics, now ships more than 100 vehicles a year by air and thousands more by road. His clients are still mostly based in the Middle East and include royal families. He recently transported a \u201chumongous\u201d Mercedes to Los Angeles for \u00a320,000 ($25,000) and a \u00a312m ($15.3m) bespoke Bugatti Chiron Hermes edition to Marbella, Spain, for a Qatari prince. If anything, he says, the flow of wheels has reversed; he\u2019s often transporting cars from London to Dubai for people travelling or doing business there. It\u2019s a trend the airlines are noticing too; Etihad Cargo tells me the greatest demand for its FlightValet car shipping service is now in the UK. More than half of the 139 shipments of 151 cars it flew in 2023 originated from Heathrow, mostly bound for Abu Dhabi and Dubai. December was the busiest month, and the biggest destinations for cars leaving the UAE were Frankfurt, Zurich and Chicago. Etihad will only deal with registered freight agents rather than individuals \u2014 cars are considered to be \u201cdangerous goods\u201d and the paperwork required for them to clear customs can be extensive. Hallworth, who\u2019s 33, says an annual insurance policy covers all his work, the cost of which he includes in his fees. Occasionally he politely declines new customers if things seem, well, a little off. \u201cWe always want the owner\u2019s ID, the registration documents of the cars and to get a feel of the customer,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be just, like, \u2018yeah I can do that\u2019, and the next minute you\u2019ve got a stolen car on a plane and some serious questions to answer.\u201d Like Naran, who is now developing his own hypercar (the Naran will be yours for north of \u00a32m or $2.6m), Hallworth has grown his business thanks to word-of-mouth marketing at the highest levels. This can occasionally present him with tricky requests. \u201cI\u2019ve been asked to transport horses and camels,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not really my bag, and I would never say yes to a job if I\u2019m not 100% sure the cargo is going to be alive when it arrives.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/style/how-the-super-rich-ship-their-cars/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_style_black-figurative-art-london-exhibition", "text": "Dressed in an ivory white leotard and tutu, a tall Black figure poses in retir\u00e9. Arms and legs angular, chest turned towards the light. It\u2019s a traditional oil on linen \u2014 the frothy movement of the ballerina skirt almost like an Edgar Degas. The image, a self-portrait of Chicago-born figurative painter Thelonious Stokes, is haunting and formidable. The composition appears split in two: In the dancer\u2019s right hand extended towards the shadows, he holds two thirds of watermelon, while a chicken stands at his feet. His face, turned away from the light, is painted coal black \u2014 a recurring reference throughout Stokes\u2019s work to the racist practice of blackface. As the dancer\u2019s body lifts up elegantly towards the top left of the painting, the figure seems torn, metaphorically snatched backward by this constellation of racialized tropes. Two of Stokes\u2019 oil paintings\u00a0\u2014 \u201cTired of Being a N*gger; Champion of A Fowl; Crossroads red ribbons and chalk lines\u201d (2023)\u00a0 and \u201cThe Cry\u201d (2023) \u2014 are on display at a new London exhibition exploring the boundaries of Black figurative painting. \u201cThe Whole World Smiles With You,\u201d a group show curated by Alayo Akinkugbe at Opera Gallery, offers a more complex view of the genre often overridden, said Akinkgube, by the market\u2019s collective preference for work that expresses \u201cBlack Joy\u201d \u2014 a phrase used to define resistance and liberation through celebration. The show takes its name from the second half of the 1928 song, \u201cWhen You\u2019re Smiling (The Whole World Smiles With You),\u201d made famous by Louis Armstrong. \u201cIt\u2019s this idea that if (a Black person) is happy, then all is good,\u201d Akinkugbe told CNN during a preview of the exhibition. \u201cThese bright, vivid, happy, palatable paintings did really well post-2020,\u201d he said, referencing the killing of George Floyd on May 25 by then-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. \u201cThese were the images that were easy for the art world to engage with. But what happens if you don\u2019t make work that\u2019s so overtly Black, joyous or positive?\u201d Split into three themes, Akinkugbe has sought out artists whose work escapes a neat definition. In the bright yellow-green gallery, viewers are first welcomed with giant, sunny portraits by Adjei Taiwah and tall, sumptuous musings on flesh by Amoako Boafo. These are the \u201cbright, vivid\u201d works Akinkugbe notes have been leading the charge. Later, the Black figure is extrapolated completely \u2014 a comment on the racist history of Black caricatures, what happens when the Black physicality is changed according to a political narrative. Faces are obscured by drifting loose threads as in Noel Anderson\u2019s woven image; or, as is the case with multimedia artist Jazz Grant, the vast plains of personhood are rendered literally in collage-style cuttings of clouds, horizons, terrains and textures. \u201cWhen we think of figurative art, it can be quite limited,\u201d said Akinkugbe. \u201cI hope this exhibition shows how sprawling it can be.\u201d Technically, the definition of figurative art is broad \u2014 it\u2019s only prerequisite being that it must depict the human form \u2014 yet it has historically\u00a0 been defined by white painters such as Leonardo da Vinci, Vermeer, David Hockney, Lucien Freud and Jenny Saville. In 2013, two years after his death, Francis Bacon\u2019s 1969 figurative triptych \u201cThree Studies of Lucian Freud\u201d broke the world record for the most expensive painting ever sold at auction. But what happens when your reflection is missing from the gallery walls? You simply paint yourself into the picture. That idea of active representation, of grabbing back the mirror, is Akinkugbe\u2019s final theme. \u201cI\u2019ve always found that very interesting,\u201d she said. \u201cThe ways that artists try to usurp the canon. Either supplanting white figures or bringing them to the fore, adopting tropes of European portraiture but using a Black figure.\u201d \u2018I paint for the Black grandmas of the future\u2019 Stokes calls his penchant for painting classic European Judeo-Christian scenes of Anunications, cherubs and Jesus on the cross using exclusively Black forms \u201cBlackwashing.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s giving people something to have, something to hold,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I was riding through Ghana for the first time in West Africa, I saw a lot of depictions of the Anglo Saxon Christ. It was a little disheartening.\u201d These are not, he insists, reimaginings, as some might be tempted to call them. \u201cThe term reimagining is to neglect so many genuine narratives,\u201d he said. \u201cI like to say we\u2019re reclaiming.\u201d But challenging art history is less interesting to Stokes, whose primary aim is empowerment within his community. \u201cI paint for the Black grandmas of the future,\u201d he said, \u201cFor them to have something in their house. I want those Judeo-Christian images to be bootlegged, re-copied and printed. I want people to have those pictures in their homes.\u201d While public and institutional interest in Black art has been increasing steadily since 2008, attention and engagement is often inextricably linked to the news cycle. According to a report published by ArtNews and Morgan Stanley earlier this year, sales of works by African-born artists (born after 1974) jumped from $16.2 million to $40.6 million in 2021. However by 2023, the total had dropped from $52.1 million down to $17.9 million. \u201cI do think that in the art world, there was a huge reaction to 2020. So I guess the question is, where are we going from here?\u201d said Akinkugbe. \u201cIt\u2019s not that this hasn\u2019t happened before, with the Black Arts Movement in the US and the UK in the \u201880s, also with the Harlem Renaissance (in the 1920s.) We\u2019ve had these movements where there\u2019s been a peak in interest, almost like Black creators have become a trend, then it passes.\u201d Could exhibitions like \u201cThe Whole World Smiles With You\u201d ever make a dent in the pervasive white syllabus of art history? \u201cI would love for someone to see these paintings and have their gaze challenged,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it could broaden someone\u2019s idea of what Black art is.

{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_style_gregory-crewdson-photos-suburbia-retrospective", "text": "By now, the famed photographer Gregory Crewdson\u2019s well-oiled, large-scale shoots are well documented. He has shut down areas of small towns and built soundstages of shadowy home interiors to get at what lays beneath the suburban facade, encapsulating a disquieting view of America. His weekslong productions include a full crew (and costs) comparable to small independent films,\u00a0as well as a casting process to find subjects who have a particular sense of melancholy. But for his earliest bodies of work, made in the late 1980s and early \u201990s, Crewdson hacked it the best he could. As a student at Yale\u2019s MFA photography program, he shot what he could find in homes in Connecticut and Western Massachusetts, directing families to act out scenes of creeping unease. He built uncanny table-top sets and tableaus of animals in nature akin to museum dioramas, using forced perspective to make them seem larger-than-life. For his formative images of small-town landscapes, he procured a tree surgeon\u2019s crane to get high above the rooftops, and \u2014 dangerously \u2014 pirated electricity from homes to light scenes rather than rent generators. \u201cIt was such a ragtag team,\u201d Crewdson recalled in a video call with CNN. \u201cIt was a bit like the Wild West \u2014 we had very few permissions or permits. We were just out there improvising, and it felt so exciting.\u201d Three decades later, Crewdson is reflecting across all his work as a major retrospective opens at the Albertina museum in Vienna, showing all his series together (minus his commercial work) for the first time. Among them, the self-titled show\u00a0brings together his grand, eight-year endeavor \u201cBeneath the Roses\u201d from the mid-2000s, his earlier low-budget black-and-white images of \u201cHover\u201d from 1996, and his meditative return to photography after a difficult period of divorce and transition, \u201cCathedral of the Pines\u201d in 2013. The show\u2019s curator, Walter Moser, framed the exhibition and catalog around Crewdson\u2019s long dialogue with cinema, including inspirations such as David Lynch, Steven Spielberg and Alfred Hitchcock. \u201cHe really is quoting popular culture,\u201d Moser said in a phone call with CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s a visual language we all know\u2026 so we can connect to that. At the same time, his topics are very in the present.\u201d When Crewdson began his career, he was among a set of postmodernist photographers \u2014\u00a0including Jeff Wall, Cindy Sherman and Philip-Lorca diCorcia \u2014 who were concerned with the artificiality of photography, often blurring truth and fiction. \u201cThey analyze how we perceive reality, and how reality is constructed in photography,\u201d Moser said. With Crewdson\u2019s work, he added: \u201cIt\u2019s completely staged, and every detail is thought through. But at the same time, it\u2019s also documentary in the sense that he\u2019s really reflecting the state of society.\u201d From the beginning, the now-familiar elements in his work were already present. Consider an image taken in the late \u201980s made in Pittsfield, Massachusetts \u2014 a city he has continually returned to, including amid its industrial decline for 2018\u2019s \u201cAn Eclipse of Moths.\u201d In the cool glow of nighttime, he photographed the view of a lit baseball field outside of a bedroom window, gauzy curtains pushed back. The composition of mysterious lighting, nighttime stillness and window \u2014 motifs that he\u2019s often returned to in the years since \u2014 clicked something into place, he said, a sense of something \u201cthere but not there\u201d that he\u2019s strived for ever sense. (The phrase is also the title of a 2017 documentary short directed by his studio manager and romantic partner, Juliane Hiam.) \u201cI remember taking it and knowing that it felt meaningful to me. There was something beautiful to me about looking through a window at something that\u2019s slightly outside of reach,\u201d Crewdson explained. \u201cWhen I look at the work I made when I was 25 or 26, it\u2019s like \u2014 in a very early stage \u2014 it\u2019s not that far from what I even did last week,\u201d he added. A \u2018hyperreal\u2019 environment Desire and disconnection have served as the architectural foundations on which neighborhoods are built in Crewdson\u2019s world, which he described as sitting \u201cpartially outside of reality.\u201d His final images are composites of multiple frames, allowing\u00a0for every area of the image\u00a0to be sharp, making them appear \u201chyperreal,\u201d as Moser described. Lost in thought or memory, the characters Crewdson places together rarely interact in these exaggerated environments. Instead, they are often confronted with strangeness cutting through the banality of the day in the form of a blinding spotlight, blazing fire or blood in the sink\u00a0\u2014 a callback to Spielberg\u2019s aliens lurking off-screen in \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind,\u201d or the found severed ear in Lynch\u2019s \u201cBlue Velvet.\u201d Artists such as Sherman, Edward Hopper and William Eggleston, who played a role in Crewdson\u2019s take on the American psyche, are also all apparent. But by now, the photographer\u2019s highly recognizable and inimitable style has helped shape the country\u2019s image, too. Some of his forays into pop culture were by his own hand, like when he teamed up with HBO\u2019s \u201cSix Feet Under\u201d \u2014 another uncanny, iconic study of the American family \u2014 to shoot a verdant kitchen scene with the cast for the promotion of the show\u2019s third season. Another, his lone editorial commission, \u201cDream House,\u201d for the New York Times Magazine in 2002, cast A-List actors Julianne Moore, Tilda Swinton, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Gwyneth Paltrow as nameless residents of a\u00a0Vermont home, nearly obscuring their celebrity. But\u00a0his vision permeates elsewhere, too, through direct or presumed nods from other creatives: the eeriness of life in the small town of \u201cStranger Things,\u201d or the surreal floral-laden bedroom scenes of Taylor Swift\u2019s music video \u201cLavender Haze\u201d (with the latter parallels spotted by Swifties on TikTok). \u201cThat\u2019s the way culture works; it\u2019s like a two-way street,\u201d Crewdson said of unexpected references to his work. \u201cAnd sometimes it can be a little beguiling, but\u2026 you just have let that be part of the equation.\u201d Though Crewdson\u2019s body of work spans societal shifts that have included political polarization, an epidemic of loneliness, suburban anxiety and rural decline, he refrains from making specific commentary \u2014 though he contends \u201cit\u2019s in the work.\u201d He also avoids markers of place or time, switching out street signs or storefront text, and favoring non-distinct cars and clothing. Nor is his view of America a particularly wide one, shot primarily in Massachusetts, as well as New York and Connecticut, in the areas where he\u2019s lived, studied and taught his whole life. (Crewdson is\u00a0now the director of the graduate program he attended at Yale in New Haven, and resides in the Berkshires). Over time, he\u2019s revisited streets or buildings he\u2019s previously photographed and recast some of the same characters, creating subtle narrative connections across his series. \u201cThere are photographers who chronicle the American landscape in a vast way \u2014 for me, it\u2019s always been going back over and over again to the same towns,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of that\u2019s practical, because once you become a known figure in the town you can shut down streets and work with the fire department for wet downs,\u201d he explained, referring to the method to drench a set for atmospheric or weather effects. \u201cBut the bigger part is psychological. I have a connection to this place in terms of an aesthetic response \u2014 it feels familiar to me.\u201d Chasing stillness Even when Crewdson began his career, he knew his love for cinema would guide his work, though he has always stuck with teasing out the enigmatic narratives of still pictures rather than moving into film. But he didn\u2019t foresee that his productions would eventually become so immense. \u201cIt built slowly and organically, until all of the sudden you realize, \u2018This is kind of crazy, all these people,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut you have to block all that out and think about the picture in the end.\u201d He hasn\u2019t been behind the camera himself since \u2018Hover\u2019 in the 1990s; Instead, his longtime director of photography, Rick Sands, has that honor, while Crewdson prefers to have the scene come together in front of his eyes. \u201cThis might sound disingenuous, but it\u2019s the only way I really know how to make a picture now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s how I\u2019ve figured out how to reflect what I see in my head.\u201d In the 2017 documentary short \u201cThere But Not There,\u201d he describes the tranquility that occurs as the chaos of production comes together into that \u201celusive\u201d moment \u201cwhen the picture actually works,\u201d he said. It\u2019s that moment \u2014 not the final picture \u2014 that he\u2019s always chasing, he reiterated on the call. It doesn\u2019t always come easily, though; in a recent shoot, it happened, \u201cbut barely,\u201d he added with a laugh. Crewdson acknowledges that many of the themes he\u2019s returned to repeatedly, including the sense of being both \u201cpresent yet absent,\u201d are reflections of himself. His desire for a moment of stillness has wider implications in his own life. \u201cWe live our lives in like partial chaos. There are so many things that are destabilizing in life, and I have a lot of anxiety day to day \u2014 that\u2019s just a condition of being alive,\u201d he said. \u201cI think part of why we are drawn to art in general is to feel a certain sense of order or meaning. Even though my pictures can feel dystopic or sad, there\u2019s that moment where everything just comes together, and it feels like it makes sense.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/style/gregory-crewdson-photos-suburbia-retrospective/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_04_17_style_copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl", "text": "Police launched an investigation Wednesday into the fire that tore through Copenhagen\u2019s famous stock exchange building, causing the collapse of its spire and damaging centuries-old artwork and architecture. The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through\u00a0the building \u2013 known locally as B\u00f8rsen \u2013\u00a0from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen\u00a0police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a \u201ccomplicated process.\u201d Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already \u201cconducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.\u201d \u201cBut of course, there is still a lot to do, especially as we have not yet had the opportunity to examine\u00a0B\u00f8rsen itself,\u201d Belling added. The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. \u201cMy first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be the same but it\u2019s iconic to\u00a0Copenhagen\u00a0and Denmark,\u201d teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters. Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, told the news agency that a firefighter gave him the top of the spire on Wednesday morning after it was recovered following its fall. \u201cIt gives me hope because we have decided to rebuild the stock exchange because it\u2019s part of European history as a trading continent,\u201d he said. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. It has been at the heart of Danish business since then; while it no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, it serves as the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday a \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d was on fire, calling the building \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt added that 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/17/style/copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_03_19_style_big-biba-london-1960s-store-history", "text": "\u201cMy God, it\u2019s dull,\u201d said interior designer Steven Thomas of the British retail landscape in 2024. As the creative force behind the look of the wildly popular 1970s London fashion store Big Biba, Thomas knows a thing or two about engineering excitement. Big Biba \u2014 a daring, 20,000 square foot destination by fashion illustrator Barbara Hulanicki and her former marketing executive husband, Stephen Fitz-Simon \u2014 was conceived with a level of detail usually reserved for high-end concept stores.\u00a0Opened in September 1973,\u00a0it was the\u00a0fourth and final outpost of the-then iconic brand.\u00a0The\u00a0seven-floor Art Deco emporium on London\u2019s fashionable Kensington High Street featured\u00a0a soup stand inspired by Andy Warhol, a roof garden featuring real flamingos and penguins, and a much-lauded celebrity hotspot the \u201cRainbow Room\u201d. \u201cBecause the Rainbow Room looked the way it did, it didn\u2019t take long for the glitterati to latch on; it was very much a place to be seen dining,\u201d recalled Thomas in an interview with CNN. Originally designed by architect Marcel Hennequet in 1933 and named after its multi-colored ceiling (the dining room was otherwise all white tablecloths and fake plants), it \u201cbecame a venue of choice,\u201d he suggested. \u201cDavid Bowie, Mick Jagger, Bryan Ferry all dropped in.\u201d \u201cFitz employed the son of a friend who had an extraordinary knack of picking people up, like Ian Dury and the Blockheads,\u201d continued Thomas, recalling the unofficial booker. \u201cHe got the New York Dolls to play when they came over, another coup. They did a vandalizing tour of the first floor, shoplifting all the women\u2019s clothes.\u201d These stories and more are all explored in \u201cWelcome to Big Biba,\u201d Thomas\u2019s gold-fronted monograph of the venture republished this month by ACC Art Books to celebrate the brand\u2019s 60th anniversary. \u201cThis book is a testament to creative freedom,\u201d writes the now 87-year-old Hulanicki in the foreword, reflecting on her legacy. \u201cYou can do it all as long as you learn to wear a suit. Of course, your secret will be that the suit is lined in gold lam\u00e9.\u201d Making fashion democratic The Biba story began in May 1964 when Hulanicki and Fitz-Simon began running \u201cBiba\u2019s Postal Boutique,\u201d a mail-order store selling limited runs of stock. Singer Annie Lennox described the venture as having led \u201cthe way for those of us living in provincial places where we felt we were dying of drabness.\u201d Inspired by decadent styles from bygone times \u2014 albeit with drastically shortened hemlines \u2014 in earthy or muted colors such as olive, rust and \u201cbruised purple,\u201d Biba\u2019s wares certainly struck a chord with young female shoppers, and the brand rode the wave of what Thomas described as \u201cthe first burst of teenage energy and finance availability.\u201d \u201cBiba made fashion democratic,\u201d explained Martin Pel, author of \u201cThe Biba Years 1963-1975\u201d and curator of a new exhibition at London\u2019s Fashion & Textile Museum, in an email. \u201cThis expression is often overused of designers in the 1960s, particularly Mary Quant. Quant\u2019s clothes whilst youthful, were expensive. Biba was inexpensive, well designed, good quality, and up-to-the-minute.\u201d By September 1964, Hulanicki and Fitz-Simon had opened their first brick and mortar store in a former drugstore, twice moving the business into bigger premises throughout the 60s. In 1966 the brand\u2019s second shop on Kensington Church Street \u2014 where Vogue editor Anna Wintour famously did a stint as a Saturday girl \u2014 was described by Vanity Fair magazine as \u201cthe most exotic shop in London.\u201d and in the early 1970s, a boutique launched in New York\u2019s Bergdorf Goodman department store. \u201cAn act of bravery\u201d Interior designer Thomas had already designed Hulanicki and Fitz-Simon\u2019s home and the third Biba store in 1968 before being approached about the landmark seven-level store. \u201cFitz offered me two floors (of Big Biba) but I wanted it all,\u201d he recalled of his initial involvement. \u201cA moment of complete lunacy, considering Tim (Whitmore, his creative partner) and I were ex-painting students working out of my bedroom. It was an extraordinary act of bravery on their part, giving us the contract, it wouldn\u2019t happen today.\u201d Stocking Big Biba\u2019s seven floors was equal parts intimidating and invigorating said Thomas, explaining that he and Whitmore worked closely with Hulanicki throughout. \u201cBiba was always a reflection of Barbara\u2019s life,\u201d he noted, \u201cso because Barbara had a kid, of course we had a kid\u2019s floor,\u201d with d\u00e9cor inspired by Disney World, a carousel ride and miniature cottage kids caf\u00e9 with toadstool seating. On Saturdays, an actor would visit and read stories and a cr\u00e8che \u2014 a revolutionary concept in fashion retail now, let alone 50 years ago \u2014 allowed parents freedom to explore the other floors. A maternity section and a space for 11-13 year old\u2019s were similarly modern for the time, likewise the introduction of communal changing rooms \u2014 although true to the spirit of the times, many clients reportedly changed in the middle of the store itself. Elsewhere menswear took over the third floor, complete with a \u201cmistress\u201d section for purchasing more sensual items with discretion. Biba-branded household items were upstairs. While each floor took on its own theme (maternity for example was fitted with comedic outsized furniture, inspired by Ken Russell\u2019s 1971 musical comedy \u201cThe Boyfriend\u201d), much of the store was furnished in Biba\u2019s distinctive black and gold colorway, with mirrored fixtures, ostrich feathers and leopard print features. While Wintour\u2019s shopgirl life was short-lived, Big Biba\u2019s staff were a vital component of the experience remembered Thomas. \u201cThey loved working there, it was their club,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if a (customer) bought a Biba poster and stuck it on her wall, she felt part of the club. It was the theater of retail really.\u201d It was an unmitigated success. When the store opened its legendary roof gardens in 1974, they were ushered in by a party described in the British press as \u201clike walking into a film set of rather jolly moral depravity.\u201d Shoppers from all over the country, and even internationally, convened at the store to buy into the zeitgeist. According to Hulanicki, during its two-year run, Big Biba was the number two tourist attraction in the British capital after the Tower of London, with Buckingham Palace being number three. But Biba\u2019s success was short-lived. In 1969, the independent company sold a majority of its shares to another British fashion retailer Dorothy Perkins which, in August 1973 (a month before Big Biba opened), was then bought by a property development company called British Land. The high cost of keeping the store open and the faltering British economy of the mid-70s meant the new owners closed the store\u2019s third and fourth floors in March 1975, and the rest of the store followed that September against the backdrop of a nationwide property slump. Six decades on however, Biba\u2019s legacy outlasts its footprint on the high street. Its low-cost yet well-made clothing is still coveted today, with heirloom designs sometimes retailing for hundreds of dollars. As Pel noted, \u201ctoday Biba clothes stand as a lesson to both consumers and retailers that inexpensive fashion does not have to be disposable.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/style/big-biba-london-1960s-store-history/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_style_india-elections-bollywood-modi-bjp-influence-intl-hnk-dst", "text": "For nearly a century, Bollywood has held a mirror to Indian society, the plotlines of the world\u2019s most prolific movie industry reflecting the changing tides of a vast, developing nation. India\u2019s multibillion-dollar movie industry produces around 1,500 to 2,000 films per year in over 20 languages \u2013 more than any other country. And most of these are Hindi films, meaning Bollywood holds an outsized influence on the country\u2019s culture, identity and economy. And while the industry is perhaps most famous for its lavish musical productions, many films also tackle the political, religious and social issues of any given era. But where Hindi cinema once reflected certain secular, democratic values championed by India\u2019s founding fathers, many critics say the industry has veered toward the right over the past decade \u2013 coinciding with the populist rule of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Alarmed liberals and some industry insiders point to a string of recent blockbusters that they say perpetuate anti-Muslim stereotypes and sideline opposition views. While they only represent a fraction of movies produced each year, they receive outsized publicity and sometimes government support \u2013 and critics worry they serve as propaganda tools for the BJP as it aims to win a third straight term in ongoing nationwide elections. Observers and insiders say the change is profound \u2013 as if Hollywood was increasingly pandering to the Republican party\u2019s most right-wing sensibilities. These types of films swap the common romantic heartthrob archetype with heroes that champion Modi\u2019s Hindu-first policies, and villains are almost always Muslims who threaten the country\u2019s majority-Hindu population. Even movies without a religious lean are being used to amplify the BJP\u2019s domestic policies, critics say. \u201cThere are a lot of these releases coming out now,\u201d said award-winning director Raja Sen in a video interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not the kind of thing that you should be allowed to do in an election year.\u201d With voting underway in the world\u2019s most populous nation, a significant portion of its more than 200 million Muslims have voiced fear over Modi\u2019s widely expected victory. They cite sweeping BJP changes to legislation that human rights groups say unfairly target followers of the minority faith, along with a rise in anti-Islamic rhetoric. While films echoing the ruling party\u2019s views are not produced or directly funded by the BJP, many of them are publicly endorsed by the government \u2013 some by Modi directly. Though divisive, the prime minister enjoys enormous support across the country thanks to his economic wins, overseas diplomacy and brand of Hindu nationalist populism. Modi\u2019s seal of approval can therefore boost a movie\u2019s audience and bring commercial success, experts say, all while pushing anti-Muslim narratives into the mainstream and deepening India\u2019s religious divide. \u201cI have seen firsthand this tidal change in popular Hindi cinema, of films not just toeing the government line, but also just becoming \u2026 more and more vile,\u201d said Tanul Thakur, a film critic and journalist based in Mumbai, the home of Bollywood, in a phone interview. \u201cThe degree to which we are seeing the infusion of politics in popular Hindi cinema, coupled with \u2026 this very blatant disregard for India\u2019s religious minorities, and any kind of multiplicity of narratives \u2026 has been very disconcerting.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Ministry of Culture, the BJP, and the regulatory Central Board of Film Certification for comment on the claims made by critics in this story. A BJP national spokesperson has previously told CNN the\u00a0party is not prejudiced against Muslims, and the community has benefited from Modi\u2019s leadership, saying: \u201cIndia\u2019s constitution protects the Indian democracy.\u201d Changing climates Every expert who spoke with CNN agreed that the production of pro-government and anti-Muslim movies has accelerated during Modi\u2019s time in office. They pointed to a number of recent releases that pushed that agenda \u2013 including this year\u2019s \u201cSwatantrya Veer Savarkar,\u201d a biopic of a leading figure in India\u2019s Hindu-nationalist movement, and the upcoming \u201cJNU,\u201d which critics worry will demonize the titular university known for left-wing student activism. Two of the most famous examples are \u201cThe Kashmir Files\u201d of 2022 and \u201cThe Kerala Story\u201d of 2023, which were both criticized for vilifying Muslims, perpetuating negative stereotypes, worsening religious tensions and distorting historical facts. Both were also massive box office successes \u2013 \u201cThe Kashmir Files\u201d raked in over $30 million on a $3 million budget \u2013 in part because they received enthusiastic government praise. While the BJP didn\u2019t fund the productions, prominent party politicians, including Modi, publicly endorsed the two movies, and some BJP-ruled states waived tax on tickets for both. Other states gave police officers and government workers time off to watch \u201cThe Kashmir Files.\u201d \u201cThe Kashmir Files\u201d was based on the mass exodus of Kashmiri Pandits \u2013 members of Hinduism\u2019s highest caste, the Brahmin, or \u201cpriestly class\u201d \u2013 from the restive region as they fled violent Islamist militants in the 1990s. It was well received in many quarters with praise for the actors\u2019 performances, especially from some Kashmiri Hindus who claimed the film shed a light on a neglected period of their history. Its director, Vivek Agnihotri, has repeatedly rejected criticism of the movie, telling CNN in 2022: \u201cThe film is only against terrorism. I have not criticized Muslims.\u201d Sudipto Sen, director of \u201cThe Kerala Story,\u201d has similarly denied that his film propagated Islamophobia, telling local media \u201cIt has nothing to do with any religion.\u201d Then there\u2019s the recently released \u201cArticle 370,\u201d also endorsed by Modi, named after the Indian government\u2019s controversial 2019 decision to remove the special autonomy of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state, Jammu and Kashmir.\u00a0Some media and rights groups slammed the government\u2019s heavy-handed crackdown at the time, while critics of the film argued it distorted the facts and drove a government narrative that the move was essential. Critics say these types of movies stretch back years during Modi\u2019s tenure \u2013 with a similar spate of pro-government films that sprung up around the 2019 election season, including a glowing biopic of the prime minister himself which was ultimately held for release until after polls closed, due to concerns it would serve as political propaganda. Though nationalist movies rarely attract direct political backing, support from the government may also take the form of what is and is not shown in theaters. The country\u2019s strict national censor board can pull movies from cinemas or ban them from release, with reasons ranging from religious objections to accusations that plots are \u201cobscene\u201d or \u201cimmoral.\u201d The impact of Bollywood\u2019s transformation has been profound \u2013 with far-right Hindu nationalists attacking movies that offend their sensibilities, such as those critical of the government or depicting Hindu-Muslim unity. Experts say it has forced filmmakers to self-censor and streaming platforms to fall in line \u2013 with several high-profile instances in recent years of India\u2019s entertainment industry facing pressure campaigns from religious groups. They include Netflix\u2019s 2020 show \u201cA Suitable Boy,\u201d which depicts a young Hindu woman being kissed by a Muslim man at a Hindu temple, and Amazon\u2019s 2021 series \u201cTandav,\u201d which included depictions of some Hindu deities. Another example is this year\u2019s release of Netflix\u2019s \u201cAnnapoorani: the Goddess of Food,\u201d which follows a high-caste Hindu woman cooking and eating meat as she trains to become a chef. In all three instances, the filmmakers faced backlash from far-right Hindu nationalists and politicians who called for boycotts and filed police complaints against the streaming platforms and production companies. Netflix later removed \u201cAnnapoorani\u201d from its platform, saying it had been pulled \u201cat the request of the licensor.\u201d \u2018Growing intolerance\u2019 Objections to movie storylines on religious grounds date back as far as the colonial era, says Debashree Mukherjee, an associate professor at Columbia University\u2019s department of Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African studies. But what\u2019s happening now is different because it\u2019s not just individuals taking offense \u2013 rather, \u201cthe forces that are actually in power and in the demographic majority are crying wolf in order to completely silence any minority voices,\u201d she said in an email interview. Thakur and Sen both lamented the self-censorship that has ensued, saying there may be countless filmmakers and artists concerned about these issues who feel unable to speak out \u2013 which can come at a hefty cost. Movies are expensive to make, meaning there\u2019s little incentive for filmmakers to produce controversial movies that could be pulled from streaming platforms or censored by authorities \u2013 especially for independent creators without much funding, says Darab Farooqui, a screenwriter based in Jaipur and Mumbai. Under Indian law, insulting \u201creligious feelings\u201d is punishable by up to three years in prison and/or a fine. And, Farooqui says, there\u2019s the personal toll of being targeted by the far-right. \u201cThere are going to be articles in right-wing publications, there are going to be character assassinations,\u201d he told CNN in a phone interview. \u201cImagine your son or your daughter is now in college, and she\u2019s being told by her friends, \u2018What is wrong with your father, your father has turned anti-national\u2019 \u2026 you don\u2019t want to put your kids through that.\u201d Even Bollywood\u2019s biggest names aren\u2019t spared. Muslim superstar Aamir Khan was dropped from two brand ambassadorships, including the government\u2019s own tourism body, after speaking out about \u201cgrowing intolerance\u201d in 2015, according to local media reports. Now, within India\u2019s arts and film community, \u201ceven those people who used to talk a lot very openly \u2026 a lot of them have gone quiet now,\u201d Farooqui says. CNN reached out to several people from the film industry for this story, some of whom declined to be interviewed due to sensitivities around the topic. A more progressive time Bollywood wasn\u2019t always this way. Many of its prominent early filmmakers were influenced by the country gaining independence from British rule in 1947 and the bloody partition that ensued \u2013 sending Muslims to the newly formed nation of Pakistan, while Hindus and Sikhs fled to India. The traumas of Partition and religious violence, as well as the secular values enshrined in India\u2019s constitution and championed by its first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, shone in early Bollywood movies \u2013 with a \u201cnew round of Hindu-Muslim brotherhood films\u201d in the 1950s, says Mukherjee, the associate professor at Columbia University. In that era, she adds, Bollywood was \u201ca very mixed scene with a cacophony of voices,\u201d including renowned directors like Yash Chopra. His films often depicted romantic and familial relationships between Hindus and Muslims, making \u201cdeeper comments against social and religious prejudice.\u201d That\u2019s not to say all early Bollywood films preached harmony; over the decades, there were patriotic films about India-Pakistan conflicts that cast Muslims or Pakistan as the villain, often reflecting Delhi\u2019s foreign policy stance at various times. Raja Sen, the director, argues the 9/11 attacks in the United States and the ensuing wave of Islamophobia in the West also seeped into Hindi films. It encouraged some Bollywood filmmakers to \u201c(lean) into the caricature of the Muslim villain,\u201d he says. The shift we\u2019re seeing now is a far cry from earlier decades when governments offered tax waivers for \u201csafe films that would tackle, say, the evils of caste system,\u201d says Thakur, the journalist, referring to India\u2019s 2,000-year-old social hierarchy imposed on people by birth that still exists in many aspects of life, despite being officially abolished in 1950. The films that used to receive government support \u201cspoke largely for the nation, films that spoke about something that we could all be unified about,\u201d Thakur adds. Avenues for dissent India\u2019s shift to the right has had a widespread impact on the creative arts, according to Sen. He points to drama schools clamping down on what students can watch or produce, and the detention of comedians for allegedly hurting religious sentiment. Journalists have also voiced alarm over the decline of press freedoms under Modi\u2019s government. \u201cOver the last three or four years, we started seeing \u2026 a crackdown in a lot of creative output,\u201d Sen says. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had a lot of arbitrary (censorship), but I think now is where it started really getting after specific examples (of), \u2018You will not be anti-government.\u2019\u201d With avenues for dissent shrinking within Bollywood, independent filmmakers are now looking instead to regional Indian cinema, filmed in local languages away from the industry\u2019s traditional center of Mumbai. These films are growing fast; outside Bollywood, earnings from the South Indian media and entertainment industry have nearly doubled year on year, according to a 2023 report by the Confederation of Indian Industry. And these regional sectors offer space for bolder stories, especially in states not ruled by the BJP. Tamil and Malayalam cinema \u2013 mainly based in the southern states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, neither of which is governed by the BJP \u2013 both \u201cdo a fairly good job\u201d of allowing plural, critical voices, says Farooqui. And it\u2019s \u201cbecause they have political protection \u2013 they have their governments there,\u201d he says. \u201cYou cannot have great art without political protection.\u201d But the prospect of another five-year term for Modi and the BJP has filled some filmmakers with pessimism about Bollywood\u2019s near-term future. \u201cSomething\u2019s definitely got to give,\u201d Sen says. \u201cI think we are at a point where, over the next couple of years, if this government does return this year, then the oppressiveness on creativity is going to just increase.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/style/india-elections-bollywood-modi-bjp-influence-intl-hnk-dst/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}

At just over 9,000 square feet, the house from the \u201cHome Alone\u201d movie was last sold in 2012 for $1,585,000, according to real estate marketplace Zillow. With five bedrooms and six bathrooms, the Georgian-style property, built in 1921, has plenty of space to accommodate hijinks like those from the iconic 1990 film. \u201cIt\u2019s a chance to own a piece of cinematic history,\u201d said the Dawn McKenna Group, the real estate team selling the property, adding that it\u2019s a \u201crare opportunity to own one of the most iconic movie residences in American pop culture.\u201d The Christmas classic starred a young Macaulay Culkin as Kevin McCallister, an 8-year-old boy forced to fend for himself after his family accidentally leaves him at home during the holiday season. While Kevin\u2019s family is on holiday in Paris, he enjoys life to himself in the grand home \u2013 feasting on junk food and sledding down the stairs.

{"id": "2024_04_19_style_wash-day-photos-black-hair-tomesha-faxio", "text": "\u201cI was having wash day with my kids, and I was looking at their hair,\u201d the photographer Tomesha Faxio, a mother of two daughters, explained to CNN in a video call of her new monograph. \u201cI was just sitting in that moment, and it just dawned on me. Like, oh, wait a minute \u2014 this is it. I knew I wanted to showcase our hair in its natural state. I wanted to show the inherent beauty of Black natural hair.\u201d For Black women and children, wash day is equal parts essential maintenance and self-renewal. In my natural-haired family, our weekly or bi-weekly wash day starts with the gathering of the first set of tools; a wide-toothed comb, two body towels \u2014 one that can stand to get wet during the wash, another to wrap hair in afterwards \u2014 as well as shampoo, conditioner and deep conditioner. Once the two washes and conditionings have been completed in the kitchen sink, we head to the playroom, where we finger detangle with a product. Depending on if they\u2019re getting braids or not, my husband or I will blow dry our child\u2019s hair on low heat or let it air dry. (We don\u2019t typically do both of our kids\u2019 hair on the same day.) The process takes maybe three hours, but as a whole hinges on the styling that comes after the wash. This can also take hours, making it feel like every bit of a day. In the series of portraits that make up \u201cWash Day,\u201d Faxio sat with 26 families and took photos as they went through their distinct routines. Though each family had their own methods \u2014 and hair stories, which are shared in texts accompanying Faxio\u2019s photos \u2014 the cyclical nature of washings and styling has made the\u00a0day something that is universally understood, and appreciated, across Black communities. In her approach, Faxio took a pointed interest in hair as it was, versus how it was to become. \u201cI think that there\u2019s been beautiful work done on our hair portraiture and work that\u2019s been done with the hair styled in all these beautiful, intricate ways,\u201d she explained. \u201cBut I hadn\u2019t, at that time, seen a ton of work where the hair was just as is, and that\u2019s what I wanted to capture.\u201d The natural hair movement, with its first wave coming during the Black Is Beautiful era of the 1970s and the second during the digital revolution, has done their part in easing tensions around kinky, unprocessed hair, but old habits die hard. We talk often, after all, about the obsession with hair being \u201cdone\u201d and the intra-communal shame that sometimes comes with natural hair. Even as the Crown Act, a bill meant to stop hair-based discrimination, reverberates country-wide, the predisposition with how Black hair will be perceived \u2018on the job\u2019 \u2014 shorthand for by White observers \u2014 has fed into racist viewpoints and judgments on the acceptability of certain hairstyles. Faxio is hoping her book can further help foster conversations and encourage people to love their hair as it is. \u201cSo many of us have learned to accept ourselves more fully, and, in turn, are able to teach our children to do the same. We are now more informed about why we grew up thinking our hair was ugly\u2026 we can see that that these views are steeped in racism,\u201d she writes in the introduction to \u201cWash Day.\u201d \u201cWhile our children will likely continue to contend with non-inclusive beauty standards, we are putting them in a better position to understand and eradicate them.\u201d Speaking with Faxio, and engaging with her photobook, reminds me of my own childhood wash days. I had a head full of black, thick hair. Keeping me calm during washings was a task; I was afraid of water and recoiled at the idea of each session, let alone the actual practice. One weekend \u2014 my wash days were always on weekends \u2014 my mother needed support. She trotted upstairs to a cousin\u2019s apartment, hoping the elders there would help soothe my fears and step in so she wouldn\u2019t have to do it alone. (She was tired of doing things alone.) There, Mom walked me to the sink, turned the warm water on and started lathering. My aunt and grandmother took turns. I nearly soaked a towel while trying to keep the water from touching my face, but through the fear, I felt cared for. \u201cCalm down. Brooklyn, what if you turn around so your head is facing upward? Right, like that.\u201d  Twenty-five years later, I have a daughter of my own. For us too,\u00a0wash day is a high energy sport \u2014 and it\u2019s also a bonding exercise that neither of us will forget. Therein lies the beauty of the experience. \u201cI learned so much from these moms,\u201d Faxio said. \u201cThe greatest thing for me is a renewed love for wash day and renewed sense of value in the process.\u201d Before she set out to write \u201cWash Day,\u201d she\u2019d try to push back her daughters\u2019 washes because she knew that when it was all said and done, her arms would be sore and she\u2019d want to just melt in bed. Now, though, she welcomes the experience. \u201cIt\u2019s work. But spending time with these moms and thinking about how we are able to pass on love of our hair \u2014 an inheritance of pride and joy in our hair, to our kids,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt just renewed my love for the process.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/19/style/wash-day-photos-black-hair-tomesha-faxio/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_style_taiwan-celebrities-political-pressure-china-intl-hnk", "text": "As Taiwan\u2019s biggest rock band took to the stage in Beijing late last month, their home island was reckoning with the latest act of Chinese aggression. For two days, the self-governing democracy was encircled by Chinese warships and fighter jets in the largest military exercises in over a year. Addressing the tens of thousands of fans at the sold-out Bird\u2019s Nest stadium, Mayday\u2019s lead singer Ashin did not mention the aggression. But what he did say has since caused no less friction. \u201cWe Chinese people must eat roast duck when we come to Beijing!\u201d he said. It may sound like an innocuous travel tip, but his choice of words was freighted with political meaning. Ashin \u2013 one of Taiwan\u2019s biggest music stars \u2013 had referred to himself as Chinese, instead of Taiwanese. The choice of words delighted the crowd, but sparked immediate anger back home \u2013 reflecting the precarious position of Taiwanese stars with mainland appeal. Growing numbers of people in Taiwan \u2013 especially the younger generation \u2013 view themselves as distinctly Taiwanese. Many have no desire to be part of China, whose authoritarian ruling Communist Party views the self-ruled island as its territory, despite having never controlled it. Beijing has long sought to bolster its claims by emphasizing the cultural and historical ties between the two sides, but polls show only\u00a03% of Taiwan\u2019s population identify primarily as Chinese\u00a0\u2013 while 67% see themselves as primarily Taiwanese, and less than 10% now support an immediate or eventual unification with China. Under the leadership of Xi Jinping,\u00a0Beijing has become more aggressive toward Taiwan, and has abandoned official ties since the island\u2019s ruling Democratic Progressive Party came to power in 2016. But there is still considerable cultural overlap. Both sides speak Mandarin, meaning musicians from Taiwan \u2013 population 23 million \u2013 often seek to enter the lucrative market of 1.4 billion across the strait. As Beijing and Taipei have drifted further apart politically, these artists have come under increasing pressure to toe Beijing\u2019s political line. The same evening that Mayday was playing in Beijing,\u00a0Taiwanese pop queen Jolin Tsai proclaimed on stage that fans in \u201cour Chinese city of Nanchang\u201d were the most passionate, as she performed in the southern city. The phrase was taken by some Chinese fans as implying she and her audience were compatriots. Meanwhile on Weibo, China\u2019s X-like platform, dozens of Taiwanese actors, musicians, and celebrities reposted a state media post championing Beijing\u2019s claims of sovereignty over the island. \u201c\u2018Taiwan independence\u2019 is a dead end, and the reunification of the motherland is unstoppable!\u201d broadcaster CCTV said in the post, which has been retweeted nearly\u00a018 million times since it was published last Wednesday. On Douban, a popular site for reviewing movies, books and music, users compiled a list of nearly 100 Taiwanese celebrities, detailing whether each of them had shared the post. Despite her on-stage expression of kinship, some lashed out at Tsai for not reposting it. A comment with 14,000 upvotes called for authorities to suspend her concerts in China, because she \u201chad never spoken out directly.\u201d CNN has reached out to Tsai for comment. On Saturday, CCTV publicly endorsed Taiwanese celebrities who shared its post, sharing the screenshots of 36 such reposts \u2013 fueling a further backlash against those who hadn\u2019t. \u201cThose who didn\u2019t endorse and take a stand, can you not come to the mainland to make money?\u201d said a top comment with 55,000 upvotes. Lin Chen-yu, a lecturer at Cardiff University who specializes in China\u2019s censorship of Taiwanese music, said acts such as Tsai and Mayday were facing problems because \u201cboth the government and private sectors are increasingly reacting to and engaging with digital nationalism.\u201d And the marketing apparatus that can launch mainland careers is equally set up to avoid upsetting Beijing authorities. \u201cFor instance, management or touring contracts for activities in China increasingly include clauses that ban celebrities from making statements against the ideologies of the Chinese state,\u201d she said. \u201cThis, of course, includes any pro-Taiwan statements.\u201d Celebrities deemed as crossing Beijing\u2019s political red lines are often blocked from the Chinese market, with their names and works erased from television and online platforms. \u201cFor example, musicians\u2019 work can be easily removed from streaming platforms (in China), often automatically, if their names become keywords for censors on these platforms and media,\u201d Lin said. Backlash at home Mayday appear to have avoided upsetting officials in China during their Beijing show, but many Taiwanese fans say they are deeply disappointed. A whole generation of Taiwanese people grew up listening to the band\u2019s happy-go-lucky, pop-infused rock songs about the hope and heartbreak of youth, so much so that the 25-year-old band is sometimes dubbed the \u201cAsian Beatles.\u201d \u201cAs much as I used to like you, now I\u2019m just as disappointed,\u201d said a comment on Mayday\u2019s Facebook page, after the Beijing concert. \u201cI\u2019m Taiwanese. Goodbye.\u201d a fan said on Ashin\u2019s Facebook page. CNN has reached out to Mayday\u2019s record company B\u2019in Music for comment. On Monday, Taiwan\u2019s Mainland Affairs Council weighed in, accusing the Chinese Communist Party of requiring Taiwanese artists to express a political stance. \u201cSuch political maneuvers will not win over the hearts and minds of Taiwanese people, and will only deepen Taiwanese society\u2019s resentment towards the Chinese Communist regime,\u201d the council said in a statement. The remarks and retweets by Taiwanese artists of the CCTV unification post came against the backdrop of China\u2019s largest show of force around the island in more than a year. The Chinese military called the drills a \u201cstrong punishment\u201d for Taiwan\u2019s so-called \u201cseparatist acts\u201d and said they were designed to test its ability to \u201cseize power.\u201d That military muscle-flex was sparked by the inauguration of Taiwan\u2019s new President Lai Ching-te, who is openly loathed by Beijing for championing the island\u2019s sovereignty and distinct identity. As the backlash mounted in Taiwan against the musicians, Lai struck a conciliatory tone. \u201cThis is not the first time, and probably not the last, that Taiwanese artists are forced to make a political stand in China,\u201d said the leader. \u201cUnder the roof of others, it\u2019s one thing what our artists say, but what\u2019s more important is what they truly feel in their hearts. We should offer them understanding and empathy.\u201d Beijing officials said the Taipei administration was wrong to say artists were being coerced. Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office, said Taiwanese celebrities who reposted the Weibo \u201creunification\u201d message wanted \u201cto express that both sides of the Taiwan Strait are both Chinese.\u201d \u201cThese are natural expressions of true feelings,\u201d Zhu said.

The common opinions about Brutalist architecture are a far cry from the way we often describe the natural world: lush, colorful, verdant. But a new photobook is exploring nature\u2019s relationship with Brutalist architecture \u2014 from a theater in Japan to a library in Canada \u2014 and finding beauty in the contrast. Called \u201cBrutalist Plants,\u201d the book is a \u201cmix of looking into the future but also looking back,\u201d said Olivia Broome, curator of the book and creator of the @brutalistplants Instagram community of more than 30,000 followers. Broome hopes the images will inspire people to look at the built environment differently \u2014 and see it as a place that can complement nature. \u201cEither we all exist in harmony with nature and concrete, or we all mess it up so badly that nature is going to overtake everything that we build,\u201d she said. Dystopia or utopia? Brutalism, sometimes referred to as \u201cNew Brutalism,\u201d is an architectural style typified by its imposing form, use of geometric shapes and clean lines, exposed concrete, and monochromatic color schemes. Its popularity peaked between the 1950s and \u201870s and it\u2019s commonly associated with the UK and Eastern Europe, but this international style has its roots in much earlier 20th-century structures from around the world, particularly those of Swiss architect Le Corbusier, whose work prioritized functionality and large, sculptural shapes. Born in the UK, Broome grew up in Geneva, Switzerland, which first sparked her interest in Brutalism. \u201cWhere I grew up, there were a lot of mountains and concrete,\u201d she said, adding that in Geneva there were a lot of buildings by Le Corbusier: \u201cLooking back, (Brutalist buildings) feel like a homely space for me.\u201d The \u201cBrutalist Plants\u201d platform started as a hobby: Broome shared images on Tumblr before she moved it to Instagram in 2018. The account reposts the work of photographers, with tags and credits, and as the community has grown into the tens of thousands, many photographers and content creators now submit work to her. Broome was attracted to the images because of the contrast of the cold concrete with the softness of nature, which has an ambiguous \u201cdystopian or utopian feel.\u201d \u201cA lot of them are quite modernist, which is a bit more like a utopia,\u201d said Broome. Some of the photos imagine \u201chow we could be living, with plants or balconies,\u201d and the inclusion of architectural renders and AI-generated scenes show hopeful visions of our stark urban world co-existing peacefully alongside nature. On the flip side, some of them have a darker feeling. \u201cThere are a few images in there where it\u2019s genuinely overgrown architectural spaces that no longer exist,\u201d she said, adding that many were submitted by urban explorers of abandoned buildings. People are notably absent from the photos; most of the images are only of architecture and nature, but in a few instances, Broome said humans have been removed from the images to focus the narrative on the built environment\u2019s relationship with nature, which Broome feels is muddled by human presence. \u201cNobody lives in the book, really. There are no human beings. It\u2019s just plants doing their thing,\u201d she added. Controversial structures Featuring 150 photos of buildings, artworks and sculptures, the book includes a mix of images shared on the Instagram account and unseen photos sourced elsewhere, said Broome. With 41 countries featured in the book, Broome is excited to show the huge spread and variety of Brutalist works, and the architectural style\u2019s influence on more recent structures and artworks. One of the \u201cmost contested images\u201d Broome shared with her audience on Instagram, which has also made the cut for the book, is of a sculpture by German artist Karsten Fo\u0308dinger. \u201cIt\u2019s this slab of concrete that sits slightly slanted, held up by pine trees in a row. It kind of looks like a table of concrete that\u2019s attached to these trees,\u201d explained Broome. Online, some people commented it was \u201cawful for the trees\u201d and an affront to nature, while others felt the unity of concrete and wood \u2014\u00a0commonly used in house building \u2014 reflected ideas of shelter and put an artistic twist on it. \u201cThere was a lot of debate back and forth,\u201d said Broome. A lot of the images hold special meaning for Broome: a photograph of a building in Geneva is \u201ctwo minute\u2019s walk\u201d from where her father lives, and some of the buildings photographed in Melbourne and Canberra in Australia are places she\u2019s visited with family and friends. Broome, who moved back to London to study design and journalism at university, now lives in the UK where there are many Brutalist buildings to provide inspiration \u2014\u00a0including the Barbican Theatre, where the book will be launched. She believes Brutalist structures should be preserved for the future \u2014 and the integration of nature shows their adaptability. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of Brutalist (architecture) that is endangered because people don\u2019t see the value,\u201d she said. \u201c(But) there are more architects, and some feature in the book, that are working to make brutalism more accessible and more beautiful, and really showcase what it can do for different spaces.\u201d Brutalist Plants, published by Hoxton Mini Press, is out on May 16, 2024", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/brutalist-plant-photos-c2e-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "style_yushi-li-the-smothering-dream-snap", "text": " A group of men lie at the foot of a sofa, their naked bodies peeking out through a carpet of rose petals. Some look toward the photograph\u2019s protagonist, an Asian woman in a lime green dress laying across the cushioned loveseat. Others gaze away, seemingly indifferent, as if caught in some sort of hazy spell. Despite Chinese photographer Yushi Li\u2019s gentle staging, her title for the photograph, \u201cThe Smothering Dream,\u201d suggests something more sinister is at play. Referencing Dutch painter Lawrence Alma-Tadema\u2019s 1888 work \u201cThe Roses of Heliogabalus,\u201d in which a Roman emperor watches on as unsuspecting banquet guests slowly suffocate in flowers, Li\u2019s modern take \u2014 shot on a set awash with pastel colors and delicate furniture \u2014 is equally deceptive at first glance. Li, is not only the photographer, but also the muse at the center of the image. \u201cI made this very pink and kitsch dream,\u201d she said, describing the London living room set in a phone interview. \u201cBut underneath it, there is, like, some kind of violence. It\u2019s a fantasy of love and eroticism\u2026 smothering these men I desire.\u201d Shot in 2022, \u201cThe Smothering Dream\u201d was recently on show at Photofairs Shanghai as part of a group exhibition called \u201cA Quiet Gaze.\u201d It was a fitting title to showcase the work of an artist for whom an examination of the male and female gazes has been a recurring theme. Li\u2019s wider portfolio of subversive images include softly-lit nude portraits of strangers she scouted through a dating app (a series titled \u201cMy Tinder Boys\u201d). Stripped of their clothes and therefore their character, she said, the men lounge around their homes doing banal tasks: one scoops out of a fresh watermelon, while another casually balances a plate of spaghetti over his private parts. The series is partly a response to erotic images objectifying women that are historically ubiquitous in art, advertisements and photography. Although a canon of male nudes does exist, it largely comprises images shot by gay male photographers. When Li began the series in 2017, she noticed a lack of images depicting naked men as objects of desire from a woman\u2019s perspective. After some mistook her work as being shot by a male photographer, she began inserting herself into the photos \u2014 fully clothed alongside naked counterparts, and often the only person looking directly at the camera. \u201cInstead of being a passive, \u2018looked-at\u2019 thing, I want to be the one who is in control, who is creating the story, who is expressing my fantasy,\u201d said Li. Her images have also pushed back against the longstanding fetishization of Asian women, often by Western men, something Li said she has experienced first-hand: \u201cI\u2019m a small person, and come across as quiet, so I kind of fit the stereotype.\u201d Li, who was born in China\u2019s Hunan province and now lives in the UK. She said she feels flattered when women reach out to her online to say they feel empowered by her photographs. \u201cAs a woman, especially as an Asian or Chinese woman, you (should be able to) feel that you can also express your erotic desire.\u201d Who\u2019s in power? Li has been fascinated with how the idea of the gaze has, today, become \u201cless binary.\u201d She has also been examining and playing with the way classical paintings depict power dynamics, portrayals of desire and representations of the body. She brings these ideas into \u201cPaintings, Dreams and Love,\u201d an ongoing project to which \u201cThe Smothering Dream\u201d belongs. (A second photo from the same shoot, entitled \u201cAfter the Dream,\u201d hints at what has just taken place, with satin cushions and wilted petals strewn about the scene). Other sources of inspiration include Swiss painter Henry Fuseli\u2019s 1781 \u201cThe Nightmare,\u201d showing an incubus crouching menacingly atop a sleeping woman, and \u201cThe Death of Actaeon,\u201d Renaissance painter Titian\u2019s 16th-century oil painting of the Romans\u2019 goddess of the hunt, Diana, transforming the Theban hero into a stag that is then killed by his own hounds. In Li\u2019s reinterpretations, she is in full control. In the former, she wears a tight, red turtleneck as she casually sits on an unsuspecting male figure, thwarting the idea of seduction. In the latter, she strikes a calm, calculated pose, pointing a bow and arrow at a naked man in a window. But control, Li says, is subjective in images where multiple gazes can co-exist. \u201cSome of these men (in the photographs) also look at me, and the viewer also looks at all of us,\u201d she said. The internet age, she added, has only further complicated matters. \u201cNow you can look at so many things like instantly, everywhere, or wherever, whenever you want\u2026 it\u2019s something very different, it\u2019s not (just) a physical thing, it\u2019s a digital thing. \u201cThere\u2019s also the gaze from the algorithm, and the gaze from the screen that reflects yourself when you look at it\u2026 the internet (means) we\u2019re subjected to the gaze more, in a way.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/yushi-li-the-smothering-dream-snap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_style_princess-diana-exhibition-london-intl-scli-gbr", "text": "Some of the most unforgettable photos of Princess Diana, such as her \u201crevenge dress\u201d that broke royal protocol and her handshake with an AIDS patient that changed the way the world treated those with the illness, have gone on display in a new exhibition in London. The exhibition, which is being held at Dockside Vaults just north of London\u2019s Tower Bridge and runs from May 25 to September 2, traces Diana\u2019s life as a humanitarian, a mother and a fashion icon. It displays a carefully curated selection of work by renowned royal photographer Anwar Hussein, 85, who started snapping Diana when she was 19. \u201cAt first, some told me \u2018you can\u2019t do pictures of royals,\u2019\u201d Anwar told CNN ahead of the exhibition\u2019s launch. \u201cI said, \u2018why not? I want a change.\u2019 I was doing rock and roll pictures - Bob Marley, Elton John, The Beatles. And then I got fed up with show business.\u201d Weaving through the vault\u2019s underground network of tunnels, CNN was given a tour of the exhibition by Anwar\u2019s two sons, Samir, 45, and Zak, 43. The pair have followed in their father\u2019s footsteps to become royal photographers in their own right, snapping viral photos of younger generations of the royal family. \u201cDiana did really buck the trend, especially for royals. She changed so much, and things that are now seen as normal, such as what Kate or Meghan wear, it was really Diana that changed all of that,\u201d said Samir, standing in front of a floor-to-ceiling print of the famed \u201crevenge dress\u201d photo, taken at a Vanity Fair party on the same day that Charles publicly admitted to adultery. \u201cA lot of people didn\u2019t think she was going to come out, and then she just came out looking like a million dollars and made a really big statement that, \u2018I\u2019m not going to hide away, I\u2019m still going to be my own person,\u2019\u201d Zak added. For Anwar, it\u2019s a very different photo that stands out to him. \u201cThis was Diana\u2019s favorite,\u201d he said, looking up at a photo of Diana cradling a young cancer patient during a trip to a hospital in Lahore, Pakistan, in 1996. \u201cThe boy was blind. He smelled of all these chemicals they had been using, but she didn\u2019t care and she cuddled him,\u201d Anwar said. \u201cLater on, he died and she was very sad about that. It shows her humanitarian side.\u201d Over the years, Anwar and his sons have taken hundreds of thousands of photos of the royal family. There is one word, however, which seems to encapsulate the images on display: legacy. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want (the exhibition) to be controversial. We wanted it to be a celebration of Diana\u2019s life and her legacy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had \u2018The Crown,\u2019 we\u2019ve had films about Diana, so it feels like there is a whole new generation experiencing it.\u201d And for Samir and Zak, their father\u2019s influence has also had a profound impact on their lives, something which is illustrated by two almost identical, yet eerily different, photos on display in another part of the exhibition. In the first photo, taken in 1992, Diana sits alone in front of the Taj Mahal in India, her red and purple suit, designed by Catherine Walker, is a pop of color against the softer backdrop of the ivory-white marble mausoleum. Anwar was told on the day of the Taj Mahal visit that Charles had other engagements, so Diana went without him, Zak says, recalling his father\u2019s recollections. \u201cShe ended up posing up in front of it, in front of this monument to love,\u201d he said. \u201cFairly soon afterwards, they announced their separation.\u201d Some 24 years later, Zak returned to the same spot to photograph Prince William and his wife, Catherine. \u201cThere was a lot of speculation. Would they recreate the picture of Diana there?\u201d Zak said. \u201cThey arrived and sat on the bench, but this time it\u2019s two people that are very much in love.\u201d In many ways, the exhibition is a love letter to two families: the Husseins behind the lens, multiple generations of royals in front of it. \u201c(Our father has) never done anything like this before,\u201d Samir said. \u201cHe\u2019s getting on now, he\u2019s a bit older and I think he really wanted to do a celebration of what he had done and a celebration of her as a person.\u201d In a statement, Anwar said: \u201cI am delighted that the images captured, as well as those of my sons, are coming home to London to recognize and memorialize such a remarkable woman and her sons.\u201d Tickets for the exhibition, which start at \u00a317 (about $22), include a 60-minute audio tour detailing the first-hand accounts behind each photograph.
