The exhibition, which is being held at Dockside Vaults just north of London\u2019s Tower Bridge and runs from May 25 to September 2, traces Diana\u2019s life as a humanitarian, a mother and a fashion icon. It displays a carefully curated selection of work by renowned royal photographer Anwar Hussein, 85, who started snapping Diana when she was 19. \u201cAt first, some told me \u2018you can\u2019t do pictures of royals,\u2019\u201d Anwar told CNN ahead of the exhibition\u2019s launch. \u201cI said, \u2018why not? I want a change.\u2019 I was doing rock and roll pictures - Bob Marley, Elton John, The Beatles. And then I got fed up with show business.\u201d Weaving through the vault\u2019s underground network of tunnels, CNN was given a tour of the exhibition by Anwar\u2019s two sons, Samir, 45, and Zak, 43. The pair have followed in their father\u2019s footsteps to become royal photographers in their own right, snapping viral photos of younger generations of the royal family. \u201cDiana did really buck the trend, especially for royals. She changed so much, and things that are now seen as normal, such as what Kate or Meghan wear, it was really Diana that changed all of that,\u201d said Samir, standing in front of a floor-to-ceiling print of the famed \u201crevenge dress\u201d photo, taken at a Vanity Fair party on the same day that Charles publicly admitted to adultery. \u201cA lot of people didn\u2019t think she was going to come out, and then she just came out looking like a million dollars and made a really big statement that, \u2018I\u2019m not going to hide away, I\u2019m still going to be my own person,\u2019\u201d Zak added. For Anwar, it\u2019s a very different photo that stands out to him. \u201cThis was Diana\u2019s favorite,\u201d he said, looking up at a photo of Diana cradling a young cancer patient during a trip to a hospital in Lahore, Pakistan, in 1996. \u201cThe boy was blind. He smelled of all these chemicals they had been using, but she didn\u2019t care and she cuddled him,\u201d Anwar said. \u201cLater on, he died and she was very sad about that. It shows her humanitarian side.\u201d Over the years, Anwar and his sons have taken hundreds of thousands of photos of the royal family. There is one word, however, which seems to encapsulate the images on display: legacy. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want (the exhibition) to be controversial. We wanted it to be a celebration of Diana\u2019s life and her legacy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had \u2018The Crown,\u2019 we\u2019ve had films about Diana, so it feels like there is a whole new generation experiencing it.\u201d And for Samir and Zak, their father\u2019s influence has also had a profound impact on their lives, something which is illustrated by two almost identical, yet eerily different, photos on display in another part of the exhibition. In the first photo, taken in 1992, Diana sits alone in front of the Taj Mahal in India, her red and purple suit, designed by Catherine Walker, is a pop of color against the softer backdrop of the ivory-white marble mausoleum. Anwar was told on the day of the Taj Mahal visit that Charles had other engagements, so Diana went without him, Zak says, recalling his father\u2019s recollections. \u201cShe ended up posing up in front of it, in front of this monument to love,\u201d he said. \u201cFairly soon afterwards, they announced their separation.\u201d Some 24 years later, Zak returned to the same spot to photograph Prince William and his wife, Catherine. \u201cThere was a lot of speculation. Would they recreate the picture of Diana there?\u201d Zak said. \u201cThey arrived and sat on the bench, but this time it\u2019s two people that are very much in love.\u201d In many ways, the exhibition is a love letter to two families: the Husseins behind the lens, multiple generations of royals in front of it. \u201c(Our father has) never done anything like this before,\u201d Samir said. \u201cHe\u2019s getting on now, he\u2019s a bit older and I think he really wanted to do a celebration of what he had done and a celebration of her as a person.\u201d In a statement, Anwar said: \u201cI am delighted that the images captured, as well as those of my sons, are coming home to London to recognize and memorialize such a remarkable woman and her sons.\u201d Tickets for the exhibition, which start at \u00a317 (about $22), include a 60-minute audio tour detailing the first-hand accounts behind each photograph.

{"id": "2024_05_27_style_on-becoming-a-guinea-fowl-cannes-rungano-nyoni-interview-spc", "text": "The final, searing shot of Rungano Nyoni\u2019s \u201cOn Becoming a Guinea Fowl\u201d is a convergence of everything that\u2019s come before. The film, about a sudden death and family secrets in Zambia, comes to a thundering conclusion in a shouting match that threatens to drown out all empathy. Trauma, misogyny and Kafkaesque logic combine in a toxic brew that\u2019s difficult to stomach, for us as well as its main character. For a film that has remained even-tempered in its study of family values \u00ad\u2013 and the groupthink family can foster \u2013 finally, its pulse quickens. You realize that rage, that had felt disquietingly absent before, was there all along. Nyoni\u2019s first movie \u201cI Am Not A Witch\u201d broke through at the Cannes Film Festival in 2017 and won her a BAFTA. The Zambian British filmmaker returned to the festival with another acerbic work, this time with heavyweight backing in the form of US distributor A24 (\u201cEverything Everywhere All At Once,\u201d \u201cThe Zone of Interest\u201d) and producer Element Pictures (\u201cPoor Things\u201d), winning the award for best director in the Un Certain Regard competition on May 24. Like her debut, a satire on the practice of witch camps, also set in Zambia, the country of Nyoni\u2019s birth, \u201cGuinea Fowl\u201d deals with injustice in tragicomic fashion. This time the writer-director\u2019s target is historic abuse, and what happens when the perpetrator can\u2019t or won\u2019t be held accountable. The idea came from a scrapped plotline for Nyoni\u2019s previous film, she told CNN, in an interview during the festival. She revived it through intensive research, interviewing survivors in Zambia for her Bemba and English-language screenplay. \u201cWhat I found quite remarkable was how casual people are about sexual abuse,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes everybody knows the perpetrator and sits at the (same) dinner table. How do you cope with that? How do you cope with somebody, that everybody knows they do that, and then ask them to pass the salt? It\u2019s bizarre to me. How do you not get up and just set everything on fire?\u201d That most people don\u2019t is the thread Nyoni wanted to pull at. \u201cThe difficulty of speaking up and the submissiveness you experience in that silence,\u201d she said, is \u201can ongoing subject\u201d in her filmmaking. Her sophomore feature concerns Shula (Susan Chardy), a middle-class Zambian who has recently returned from a life abroad. One night, on the way back from a fancy dress party, she discovers her uncle dead by the roadside. She reports this to her father only to be met with the first of a series of bizarre responses to the news. \u201cUncle Fred can\u2019t die. Just sprinkle some water on him,\u201d she\u2019s told. Her father is right, albeit for the wrong reasons: Uncle Fred has been living in Shula\u2019s head ever since he abused her as a child. She\u2019s not the only survivor in the family, we learn, nor was any of this much of a secret. Nevertheless, there\u2019s a funeral to be arranged, public displays of mourning to wail through, and a lot of history to be swept under the carpet. Spiking her drama with surreal images and poetic flourishes, Nyoni sends audiences through the looking glass, then pulls them back with pitch black humor, asking us to question whether what we\u2019re watching is all that absurd in the first place. \u201cYou don\u2019t even look traumatized,\u201d one affronted aunty tells Shula in the aftermath of Fred\u2019s discovery. Later at a gathering of mourners, another aunty instructs her to \u201ccry a bit.\u201d \u201cWhy are you so cold hearted?\u201d she adds, \u201cYou\u2019re embarrassing us.\u201d Nyoni sees her film as corrective to how abuse is often depicted. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you see in a lot of movies,\u201d she explains, \u201c(where) you say your secret, and everyone comes around you. From my experience \u2013 and from what I saw from other people \u2013 sometimes that doesn\u2019t happen. Then how do you live with that?\u201d \u201cGuinea Fowl\u201d zeroes in on a bitter irony: the same conspiracy of silence that is breaking apart individuals is also holding the family together. Deference and duty remain paramount, and to the mourners who descend on the family home to pay their respects, everyone appears outwardly functional. (That this is happening in a matriarchal society, where men are largely side-lined, makes it even more confounding.) \u201cI know quite well about keeping secrets,\u201d said the writer-director, cryptically. Of the film\u2019s family dynamics, \u201cI know this subject,\u201d she elaborated, \u201cbut this is definitely a fictionalized version of whatever it is I\u2019ve experienced.\u201d Faced with a family omerta and a dead perpetrator, there\u2019s nowhere for Shula to place her anger. \u201cYou can\u2019t question a corpse,\u201d her father says, imploring her to let bygones be bygones. It\u2019s taboo to speak ill of the dead. But as memories continue to hemorrhage through, her reaction to her abuser\u2019s death poses questions of his enablers. In her feature debut, Chardy rises to the challenge of playing Shula. \u201cI empathize with her a lot,\u201d said the actor. \u201cAs a person I have a lot to say, and to find this medium where you\u2019re trying to say something without saying something, it\u2019s a push and pull between feeling powerless and powerful at the same time.\u201d The writer-director also sees some of herself in her lead. \u201cI have this rage,\u201d Nyoni said. \u201cYou can see it, but maybe it\u2019s more subtle, it\u2019s somehow repressed.\u201d Screenwriting is \u201calways a reflection of what I\u2019m going through,\u201d she added, \u201cI try not to get in the way of that.\u201d Shula is not the only perspective the director was interested in, however. Nyoni increasingly folds in the narrative of Fred\u2019s young widow (played by Norah Mwansa) \u2013 a victim herself, further victimized by his death. \u201cThe widow I struggled with, so we found people who\u2019ve been in the same situation,\u201d Nyoni said. \u201cThey were very candid, and told me about their stories and were really open.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got worse stories to tell about what happens (than what appears in the film),\u201d she added. \u201cWidows end up being a scapegoat for a lot of people\u2019s frustrations.\u201d In its final act, \u201cGuinea Fowl\u201d shows how difficult it can be to truly break the cycle of abuse. Yet Nyoni\u2019s complicated portrait of family trauma is not without hope, thanks to Shula and a last gasp moment full of sound and fury, signifying everything. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s the most powerful shot in the film,\u201d said Chardy. \u201cIt\u2019s bigger than \u2018(Shula) finds strength;\u2019 she owns what happened to her and wants to take everybody else with her.\u201d Chardy hopes the film\u2019s sense of resolve will resonate. \u201cThere are a lot more women in the world who have gone through this, and you really don\u2019t know until you speak to someone,\u201d she added. \u201cI hope that (audiences) will be able to find some strength from the journey that Shula finds herself on.\u201d \u201cOn Becoming A Guinea Fowl\u201d premiered at the Cannes Film Festival and is coming soon to theaters in the US and UK.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/style/on-becoming-a-guinea-fowl-cannes-rungano-nyoni-interview-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_04_04_style_taipei-101-earthquake-design-intl-hnk", "text": "The deadly 7.4 magnitude earthquake that hit Taiwan on Wednesday and left at least 9 people dead, also damaged 770 buildings, according to the latest estimates from the island\u2019s National Fire Agency (NFA). In the capital Taipei, just 80 miles away from the epicenter, buildings also shook violently during what was Taiwan\u2019s strongest earthquake in 25 years. But in a triumph of modern engineering, the soaring Taipei 101, once the world\u2019s tallest skyscraper, emerged from the island\u2019s latest seismic event undamaged. Footage from the quake appears to show the 1,667-foot-tall tower slightly swaying, its structural flexibility helping to counter the powerful motion of the quake. This movement perfectly demonstrated how the skyscraper\u2019s single most important defense against earthquakes is the very material it is constructed from: reinforced concrete. Combining concrete\u2019s compressive strength with steel\u2019s tensile strength, the material makes the building flexible enough to sway, yet rigid enough to resist high winds and the typhoons that frequently hit Taiwan. (The principle that buildings can endure seismic forces by moving with them, rather than against them, has underpinned traditional architecture in earthquake-prone East Asian countries for centuries, from Japanese pagodas to Chinese palaces.) High within the tower,\u00a0however, another technological innovation helps protect the 101-story skyscraper \u2014 a huge orb-like device known as a tuned mass damper. Giant counterweight Suspended from 92 thick cables between the 87th and 92nd floors, the golden steel sphere can move about 5 feet in any direction. As a result, it acts like a pendulum that counteracts (or \u201cdampens\u201d) swaying motions. \u201cIt\u2019s essentially a very large counterweight,\u201d explained Stefan Al, author of \u201cSupertall: How the World\u2019s Tallest Buildings Are Reshaping Our Cities and Our Lives,\u201d in a phone interview. \u201cIn the case of Taipei 101, it\u2019s 660 tons. That seems really heavy, but if you compare it to the overall weight of the building, it\u2019s just a fraction. \u201cWhen a building starts to shake, (the tuned mass damper) will move in the opposite direction. In the case of Taipei 101, it\u2019s suspended\u2026 so it will lag behind as the tower sways and will absorb the kinetic energy by moving in the opposite direction,\u201d Al said, explaining that hydraulic cylinders between the ball and the building convert this energy into heat, which is then dispersed. Tuned mass dampers are used in skyscrapers around the world, including the \u201csuper-skinny\u201d Steinway Tower in New York and Dubai\u2019s sail-shaped Burj al-Arab, which has 11 of them. The device crucially protects against the violent motion caused by \u201charmonic vibration,\u201d which can cause structural failure during an earthquake, Al said. \u201c(That\u2019s) when buildings start to vibrate at their own resonance,\u201d he said, comparing the phenomenon to a tuning fork. \u201cThis can lead to a collapse, (as the building) will start shaking faster and faster and faster.\u201d Tuned mass dampers, which are also known as harmonic absorbers, are \u201ctuned\u201d to resonate at the same frequency as the building \u2014 but with wavelengths starting earlier or later, helping to dissipate the potentially catastrophic energy. The stability they provide can also reduce the uncomfortable \u2014 or even nauseating \u2014 effect swaying can have on a building\u2019s occupants in high winds. Structural support Designed by Taiwanese firm C.Y. Lee & Partners, Taipei 101 was the world\u2019s tallest building from 2004 until 2007, when it was surpassed by the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. An observation deck overlooking its groundbreaking tuned mass damper is now a popular visitor attraction, especially when it moves during strong winds. The giant sphere is not, however, the only design feature helping stabilize the tower, which stands close to a major fault line. For one, the skyscraper sits on exceptionally deep foundations \u2014 namely 380 reinforced concrete and steel piles drilled down into the bedrock below. Above them, the building\u2019s core is connected to a series of \u201cmega-columns,\u201d located around its perimeter, via enormous steel outrigger trusses. The high-rise complies with strict anti-seismic building codes that are as stringent as one might expect on an island located along the \u201cPacific Ring of Fire,\u201d which runs around the edge of the Pacific Ocean and causes massive seismic and volcanic activity from Indonesia to Chile. But while the design also underwent extensive digital modeling and \u201cshake table\u201d testing (in which scale models are tested on a device that replicates the movement of an earthquake), how a building like Taipei 101 would react to a stronger or closer seismic event remains, to an extent, theoretical. \u201cEven though we have computer simulations, there\u2019s still something about the physical that that we cannot really get from digital simulations,\u201d said Al, adding: \u201cDespite our technological advances, we are still testing (designs) in wind tunnels and shaker tables.\u201d This article has been updated to reflect the latest estimates on the number of buildings damaged.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/04/style/taipei-101-earthquake-design-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_04_27_style_rr-head-labs-denver-barbers-prison", "text": "\u201dThis is nerve-wracking,\u201d James Canody exclaimed \u2014 through an exhale \u2014 of his new job as an apprentice at the Denver-based business R&R Head Labs. When speaking with CNN, Canody had been working as an apprentice at the barbershop for 13 days. Fourteen days ago he had been released from prison, where he served 6 and a half years of an 18-year sentence. Canody is one of 650,000 people released from prison every year across the United States, according to the Department of Justice. That\u2019s a population of which nearly 75% are still unemployed a year after being released. According to the Brookings Institution, stable employment has been shown to reduce recidivism, but even for those who find a job, earning capacity is likely hindered: Based on a report released by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, formerly incarcerated people who do find employment after their release tend to earn just 53% of the median US worker\u2019s wage. Canody is one of eight employees \u2014 apprentices, barbers and managers \u2014 at R&R Head Labs, a barbershop which opened its doors in February exclusively employing formerly incarcerated and justice-impacted individuals. It aims to address the financial, logistical and emotional inequities associated with their reentry into society. Fresh starts and fresh cuts R&R Head Labs\u2019 model creates a pathway to employment by utilizing skills \u2014 and sometimes a barbering license \u2014 its employees gained while in prison. (Prison programs offering barber/cosmetology licenses are not federally mandated, rather determined state-by-state based on a variety of factors.) Barbering skills aren\u2019t a requirement to work at R&R Head Labs, however, as its paid apprentice program shepherds employees through training, the 2,000 hours of working as an apprentice and 300 hours of classroom or in-shop time required to get a barber license in Colorado. \u201cThis opportunity feels surreal and overwhelming,\u201d said Canody. \u201cBut that\u2019s a good thing. I am getting comfortable with being uncomfortable and see how barbering can help me change my life.\u201d R&R Head Labs is the brainchild of James Repenning,\u00a0a former president of the national barber chain Floyd\u2019s 99. After learning about prison barbering programs, he saw potential in combining his professional experience with a greater purpose. Together with an advisory council \u2014 a group which includes formerly incarcerated people turned advocates \u2014 Repenning has also implemented mentorship programs and community outreach in Denver. \u201cWe started by asking ourselves how we find barbers who have really committed to change and then asking, what do they need?\u201d Repenning explained in a Zoom interview with CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s about understanding how we support them in the work environment, because the pinnacle of what we want to do is give them hope and a path.\u201d Repenning and his team work with Colorado prisons to recruit individuals and get them into the apprenticeship program. According to Repenning, the support from the Colorado Department of Corrections has exceeded expectations, with parole officers facilitating barber tool starter sets and arranging job fairs. \u201cIt\u2019s important (for formerly incarcerated people) to make money \u2014 both because parole requires it and for basic survival,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe solution was to create apprenticeships, so someone can start working immediately and toward the hours they need to earn their barber license.\u201d Transformational opportunities In Denver specifically, R&R Head Labs recruitment and reentry efforts are steered by Charles Smith, a member of the company\u2019s advisory council. Smith served 24 years in prison; after his release, he became the director of advocacy and earned income strategies for CommunityWorks, a non-profit organization which provides job seekers with support service and job readiness instruction. Speaking about the main challenges formerly incarcerated individuals face, Smith lists housing and employment as the most crucial. \u201cEmployment is going to sustain you,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe idle mind is the devil\u2019s workshop. You start doing things, you start drifting. Employment keeps you stable and focused.\u201d \u201cThe model would be to have someone like Charles in every state we go to,\u201d added Repenning. \u201cMany of the people we talk to are people he served with, so there\u2019s a great deal of trust there.\u201d Smith aims to connect with inmates around 90 days before their release date, to start mentoring and prepping them to make their acclimation to life outside of prison easier and more tolerable. Understanding the \u201cpolitics of what happens in prison\u201d is something Smith considers a crucial aspect of his work, and one he believes offers an advantage in approaching and vetting prospective barbers. Several of the seven full-time and part-time barbers currently working at the first location are people Smith knew while serving his own sentence \u2014 including James Canody. \u201cPeople in prison are a forgotten population,\u201d said Smith. \u201cIt is a huge help to people coming out of prison to see and feel that someone finally believes in you. It makes you want to be better.\u201d In\u00a0keeping with its overarching ethos, even R&R\u2019s physical space was designed to best accommodate formerly incarcerated people. With guidance from the\u00a0advisory board, the space was specifically designed to minimize triggers for its employees,\u00a0down to its color palette and barber chair positioning. \u201cEverything by design has to do with connectedness,\u201d explained Repenning. \u201cA lot of barber shops are stainless steel\u2026 ours needs to be super welcoming and warm.\u201d Repenning and his team learned which colors and palettes to stay away from: Certain shades of orange, red, green and blue (which could serve as a reminder of jumpsuit colors) were out; brighter colors, embodying outdoor themes of woodlands and greenery were chosen instead to soften the environment and make it feel uplifting, energetic and approachable. Barber chairs are positioned so that no barber\u2019s back is to the door, another potential vulnerability for an employee who had previously served prison time. \u201cPrison can be a very dangerous place,\u201d said Repenning. \u201c\u2018Watching your back\u2019 takes on extra significance, thus our barbers tend to want to know who\u2019s behind them and who\u2019s walking into the space.\u201d A round bar where people are invited to sit and wait for their appointment was designed specifically to facilitate conversation and community. A barber\u2019s compensation includes floor earnings and commission comparable to other barbershops \u2014 but less commonly, barbers at R&R Head Labs are able to set (and raise) their own prices. Employees also receive health insurance and vacation pay. R&R Head Labs is looking to open an additional shop in Denver later this year, with future expansion into the Boston, Chicago, and New York markets planned.  In its first months of business, the R&R Head Labs location has attracted a diverse crowd, Repenning told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing every race, hair type, gender, income level and age. It\u2019s been a predictably slow start because our barbers typically don\u2019t come with a \u2018book\u2019 (of pre existing clients) as they would if they were transferring from another barbershop.\u00a0However, we are attracting 10+ new customers per day.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like bringing the \u2018hood and Beverly Hills together,\u201d added Smith. \u201cAnd creating this amazing beautiful space.

{"id": "2024_05_23_style_catherine-princess-wales-tatler-scli-intl", "text": "A new portrait of Catherine, Princess of Wales has stoked controversy online, with some royal fans criticizing the work for its portrayal of the future British Queen. The painting, by British-Zambian artist Hannah Uzor, features on the cover of the July issue of Tatler magazine. It aims to honor the \u201cstrength and dignity\u201d of the princess, according to a statement from the publication sent to CNN Thursday. It depicts Catherine during her appearance at the first state banquet of King Charles III\u2019s reign, and Uzor said she studied photographs of the princess in the process of creating the work. \u201cWhen you can\u2019t meet the sitter in person, you have to look at everything you can find and piece together the subtle human moments revealed in different photographs: do they have a particular way of standing or holding their head or hands? Do they have a recurrent gesture?,\u201d she said in the statement. Uzor also revealed that Kate\u2019s recent video announcing a cancer diagnosis informed the work. \u201cAll my portraits are made up of layers of a personality, constructed from everything I can find about them,\u201d she said in the statement. However, not everybody appreciated the portrayal of the princess. \u201cThis is dreadful - somehow, I\u2019m not sure the artist is a fan of the Princess - it looks like a bad GCSE project,\u201d reads one comment under a post from Tatler on X. \u201cThis looks nothing like the Princess of Wales. It\u2019s so awful, it\u2019s disrespectful,\u201d reads another. \u201cI agree with the sentiments of strength and dignity but the portrait lacks any resemblance to the Princess of Wales,\u201d said another. However, some did praise the work, with one calling the painting \u201cbeautiful.\u201d \u201cAm I the only person who likes this? It\u2019s art, not a photo,\u201d wrote another commenter. And it wasn\u2019t just social media users who reacted to the painting. Alastair Sooke, chief art critic at UK newspaper The Daily Telegraph, said in an article that the painting was \u201cintolerably bad\u201d and \u201cshows no flicker of resemblance to its subject.\u201d \u201cHas there been a flatter, more lifeless royal portrait in living memory?\u201d Sooke wrote. \u201cBeneath a Lego-like helmet of unmodulated, monotonously brown \u2018hair,\u2019 this Princess of Wales has as much charisma as a naff figurine atop a wedding cake.\u201d Kate Mansey, royal editor at The Times of London, was also non-plus. \u201cI\u2019m not quite sure what to say about this one, except, hmm\u2026\u201d she wrote on X. The backlash follows a similar discussion surrounding the first official portrait of King Charles III since his coronation, which was revealed earlier this month. The 8.5 by 6.5-foot painting by British artist Jonathan Yeo depicts the monarch wearing the uniform of the Welsh Guards, sword in hand, against a fiery red background that appears to almost swallow him whole, as a butterfly looks like it\u2019s about to land on his shoulder. While the King is reportedly happy with the portrait, others criticized the lurid red brushstrokes, with one person likening it to a \u201cposter for a horror film.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/style/catherine-princess-wales-tatler-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_style_miss-ai-beauty-pageant-scli", "text": "Ten women participating in a beauty pageant is nothing new. Some pose candidly, some play to the camera, their beauty forever frozen in this moment in time. Like many other pageants held\u00a0in countries around the world,\u00a0the contestants are young, thin and\u00a0embody many of the standards defining traditional \u201cbeauty.\u201d But that is where the similarities to a traditional beauty pageant end. None of these women are real \u2014 everything about them, even the emotion that flickers across their faces, is generated by artificial intelligence (AI), for the world\u2019s first ever AI beauty pageant. Each has a creator or team of creators, who use programmes like Open AI\u2019s DALL\u00b7E 3, Midjourney or Stable Diffusion to generate images of the women from text prompts. These 10 contestants have been selected from a pool of more than 1,500 entrants to make the final of \u201cMiss AI,\u201d scheduled to be held at the end of June and broadcast online by its organizers \u201cThe World AI Creator Awards.\u201d For those involved, the event is an opportunity to showcase and demystify the technology\u2019s extraordinary abilities. But for others, it represents a further proliferation of unrealistic beauty standards often linked to racial and gender stereotypes and fueled by the ever-increasing number of digitally enhanced images online. \u201cI think we\u2019re starting to increasingly lose touch with what an unedited face looks like,\u201d Dr Kerry McInerney, a research associate at the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence at the University of Cambridge, told CNN in a video interview. Each of the contestants has a unique and distinctive personality, as well as face. One red-haired, green-eyed avatar named Seren Ay poses for Instagram photos as she travels around the world and through time, appearing next to Turkey\u2019s first president Kemal Ataturk, on the Oscars red carpet or wandering through the neon-lit streets of Kyoto, Japan at night. And like real life pageant contestants, some AI avatars promote specific causes. One, named Aiyana Rainbow, posts in support of the LGBTQ community, her allyship literally displayed by her rainbow-colored hair, and name. Another, Anne Kerdi, posts about cleaning the oceans, her native region of Brittany in France and travelling. Zara Shatavari, posts tips on her blog for dealing with depression or strategies for losing \u201cstubborn belly fat.\u201d All are beautiful. But, echoing the reality of most modern Miss USA beauty pageant winners since the competition\u2019s inception in 1921, most are White, thin and have long hair and symmetrical features, detailed Hilary Levey Friedman \u2014 a sociologist and author of \u201cHere She Is: The Complicated Reign of the Beauty Pageant in America\u201d \u2014 in a phone interview.   Racial and gender biases ingrained within beauty standards also seep into programmes that use AI to generate images \u2014 since they have \u201clearned\u201d from the troves of data on the Internet that already contain these biases. As such, research has found that AI reflects these gender and racial stereotypes when generating images, reducing beauty into a homogenous ideal. To reflect standards, or to challenge them? Most of the models on the \u201cMiss AI\u201d shortlist, McInerney said, are \u201cvery very light-skinned and the vast majority are still White women, still thin, still really not diverging very much from that norm.\u201d \u201cThese tools are made to replicate and scale up existing patterns in the world,\u201d she added.  \u201cThey\u2019re not made necessarily to challenge them, even if they\u2019re sold as tools that enhance creativity so when it comes to beauty norms\u2026 They\u2019re capturing the existing beauty norms we have which are actively sexist, actively fatphobic, actively colorist, then they\u2019re compling and reiterating them.\u201d Open AI has acknowledged that it finds \u201cDALL-E 3 defaults to generating images of people that match stereotypical and conventional ideals of beauty.\u201d But while AI images can perpetuate these standards, some argue the technology doesn\u2019t represent a completely new phenomenon due to the huge number of digitally edited images online, enhanced by filters or airbrushing. \u201cWhen we look at the beauty standards of influencers, they are not real as well\u2026\u201d Furkan Sahin, one of Seren Ay\u2019s creators told CNN in a video interview. \u201cThey look perfect, it\u2019s like an AI.\u201d Though judge Sally-Ann Fawcett acknowledged \u201cthere\u2019s a long way to go,\u201d she told CNN in a phone interview that \u201cwe wanted women who are more diverse in every way, in size, in age, in flaws\u2026 It\u2019s taken 50 years for pageants to get where they are today, with AI it can be done on fast forward.\u201d Fawcett, who has written four books about beauty pageants and is the head judge at Miss GB, added that she had \u201cdoubts\u201d when she was first approached by the competition\u2019s organizers, but that she saw it as an opportunity to shift the public perception of AI-generated women. Creators of these AI models add that the technology itself is not necessarily the problem. \u201cAI makes it perfect but perfect is how people want it,\u201d said Sahin, \u201cand we are not really changing any beauty standards.\u201d Similarly, Sof\u00eda Novales, a project manager at The Clueless Press which created the popular AI model Aitana L\u00f3pez who \u201csits\u201d on the pageant\u2019s judging panel told CNN by email that \u201cwe are not here to solve this long-standing problem.\u201d \u201cBut we aim to encourage AI personalities to be diverse and acknowledge the existing issues surrounding beauty standards.\u201d AI and robotics have long been used, often by men, to create the image of a \u201cperfect woman,\u201d said McInerney, referencing the Stepford Wives trope and the 2014 movie \u201cEx Machina.\u201d As technology becomes increasingly entwined with creating this version of an ideal woman, the in-person beauty pageant world has responded with a shift towards emphasizing authenticity, says Levey Friedman. \u201cThere\u2019s been a turn in the past decade that\u2019s really focused on be yourself, be authentic, be perfectly imperfect, all these sorts of catchphrases,\u201d she added. Such notions have found their way into pop culture too \u2014 Merriam Webster\u2019s 2023 word of the year was \u201cauthentic,\u201d partly thanks to \u201cstories and conversations about AI, celebrity culture, identity and social media,\u201d the dictionary said at the time. Rewarding more than just beauty? Competition organizers say entrants will be judged on more than just their beauty. They will earn points for their creators\u2019 use of AI tools as well as their social media influence and have to answer questions like \u201cif you could have one dream to make the world a better place what would it be?\u201d Fawcett said that she is looking for \u201csomeone with a powerful, positive message,\u201d while Novales said that they are \u201cnot just evaluating beauty, but also the technology behind it\u2026 and, above all, the backstory behind each avatar.\u201d Many of these AI avatars were originally created as marketing tools, to act in the same way as a human social media influencer might. Seren Ay was created to promote an online jewellery store when its founders found it difficult to work with human influencers, they said. Aitana L\u00f3pez, can earn up to \u20ac30,000 (around $32,000) a month from sponsored posts, Novales said. Such AI influencers have already proved their worth in recent years \u2014 one named Lil Miquela has amassed millions of Instagram followers and worked with brands like Calvin Klein and Prada. Unlike their human counterparts, they appear flawless, ageless and free of scandal. They don\u2019t need to be paid and they can be directly owned by a marketing agency or by the company whose products they are promoting. \u201cInfluencers are just behind a screen,\u201d Mohammad Talha Saray, one of Seren Ay\u2019s creators, said. \u201cThey\u2019re not real for us, they\u2019re just a girl or guy on the Internet and when you think about that, there\u2019s not much difference between AI and an influencer.\u201d Other avatars have a different story. Anne Kerdi\u2019s creator S\u00e9bastien Keranvran set out to present AI in a \u201cfun and informative way,\u201d in an attempt to counter the \u201chypothetical dystopian view\u201d of the technology and offer people the opportunity to interact with it. He told CNN by email that he created Anne from different AI systems and programmed her so that \u201cshe is free to say what she wants as long as it does not involve misinformation.\u201d \u201cIt is sometimes frustrating for me to see her on video at important events expressing a view different from mine, or writing in a way I would have imagined differently but\u2026 we each have our own free will.\u201d Both Anne Kerdi and Seren Ay exist as more than simply images for their followers who often interact with them, asking advice of Seren as if she were their \u201cbig sister,\u201d said  Sahin, or wishing Anne goodnight, said Keranvran. \u201cJust as we become attached to literary or movie characters, some people are attached to Anne,\u201d he said. \u201cShe responds affectionately and sometimes humorously when someone asks how she is doing.\u201d Creators of some AI avatars use this relationship with people for the adult entertainment industry. \u201cMiss AI\u201d is sponsored by Fanvue \u2014 a site that is similar to OnlyFans and hosts both AI and human content creators. Understanding the data that is being used to train AI avatars used for sex work is crucial, McInerney said, \u201cbecause so much of the available data out there is not only really sexist, it\u2019s also very heterosexual, it might not leave spaces for other kinds of sexual orientations, identities, experiences.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/style/miss-ai-beauty-pageant-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_style_digital-dermatology-rise", "text": "Not so long ago, seeing a dermatologist was only deemed necessary if you had skin problems or possessed a famous face to be pored over in magazines or on the big screen. Not anymore. Whether it\u2019s due to the rise of social media or celebrity culture, the past decade has seen our quest for apparently flawless skin go up a gear. A recent study found Gen Z spend more cash\u202fon their skin than any other age group (and more than previous generations). And in 2023 alone, spending on skincare by tweens and teens \u202fleapt 20%. Technology has also made getting expert advice increasingly achievable, too. Online dermatology developed quickly during the pandemic when Covid-19 restrictions meant that over 90% of dermatologists were using \u201cteledermatology\u201d (e.g. video calls and digital images to discuss skin concerns remotely) compared to 14.1% pre-Covid, said the American Academy of Dermatology. The advent of digital dermatology, pushed forward by increasingly innovative and sophisticated digital tools \u2014\u00a0not only smartphones and video calling apps but artificial intelligence \u2014 is enabling a growing number of global brands to diagnose, prescribe and produce bespoke creams via virtual consultation rooms. It\u2019s dermatology without the wait list, minus the travel and, somewhat ironically, without the need for a face-to-face interaction. But is it any good? \u201cThe pandemic clearly accelerated the popularity of digital dermatology and (it) is rapidly advancing, encompassing not only teledermatology but also consumer tech, machine learning, augmented reality, and artificial intelligence,\u201d said Shoshana Marmon, Assistant Professor of Dermatology at New York Medical College. \u201cThe increased sophistication of remote offerings is a natural progression.\u201d I have never visited a dermatologist before (digitally or otherwise) or used a prescription cream, but aged 43, I am beginning to notice fine lines, large pores and signs of sun damage that require something stronger than my typical drugstore go-tos. I tried Klira, a digital dermatology service co-founded in 2021 by British dermatologist Dr. Emma Craythorne. After filling an online questionnaire about my medical history and lifestyle, I answered dozens of detailed questions about my face, sharing everything from my pore size and levels of sun exposure to shininess. This information is analyzed by Klira\u2019s in-house team of consultant dermatologists who review the questionnaire along with photos of my make-up free face. Within 24 hours, the results are back. I am a \u201cSkinSize 04,\u201d one of 12 skin categories defined by Dr. Craythorne to reflects how skin looks, feels and ages. Essentially, it means that while I have a tendency towards blocked follicles due to excess sebum, my skin is otherwise easy to manage, as long as I remember my SPF (and I haven\u2019t over the years). I am prescribed a bespoke \u201cKlira Solution\u201d to tackle \u201caccumulative UV exposure,\u201d which will be delivered straight to my door within seven days. It\u2019s for use at night and contains the chemical exfoliant tretinoin (only available on prescription) and the anti-inflammatory azelaic acid. The formula should enhance collagen production, strengthen skin barrier and even out skin tone. Support is attained via an online \u201cpersonal portal,\u201d which features instructions clinical notes, instructions on how to use the cream, plus recommendations for complimentary products to cleanse, moisturize and protect. There is a one and three-month check in via email, but you can contact the team online whenever you have questions. While the monthly subscription can be cancelled anytime on the \u00a365 flexible membership ($82), the idea is you continue until your skin goals have been reached and ideally beyond that to maintain results. Speedy, simple but not the same Although, changes to my skin might require patience (at least six weeks to see an increased \u201cglow\u201d), the speed and simplicity of the digital process itself is undoubtedly impressive. \u201cThese days, we want answers to our skin concerns fast and by using an online dermatology service, I got fantastic knowledge and experience without having to leave the house or be placed on a waiting list,\u201d said Claire Todd, 35, from Cleethorpes, England who turned to Klira to treat pigmentation. \u201cI was dubious at first as I\u2019ve used creams in the past to no avail, but after eight weeks, I could see there was a difference and at 12 weeks, (my patches of pigmentation) had almost completely gone.\u201d In Los Angeles, Emily Thompson, also 35, used an AI-powered skin technology created by Dr Simon Ourian \u2014 dermatologist to the likes of Kim Kardashian and Megan Fox \u2014 to rejuvenate her skin. An uploaded photo is analyzed by AI \u2014 alongside a detailed questionnaire about your lifestyle and skin concerns \u2014 before an avatar of Dr Simon prescribes personalized products known as the \u201c3 Daily Essentials\u201d (cleanser, toner moisturizer). \u201cI\u2019d read about Dr. Simon Ourian, so when I learned about his AI-powered skin analysis, I wanted to give it try.\u202fMy life is busy and finding time for in-person specialist appointments was always a challenge,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cThis analysis doesn\u2019t replace in-person visits for serious skin concerns,\u202fbut it worked for what I needed \u2014 my skin to feel hydrated, smoother and more radiant. I love\u202fthat I get to do this\u202ffrom home.\u201d While digital dermatology makes it possible to access the expertise of people who might otherwise be out of your price bracket or zip code, there are inevitable drawbacks and limitations to using a digital dermatologist exclusively. \u201cWhile it can offer many benefits, there are situations where in-person consultations are essential, particularly for complex or serious skin conditions requiring physical examination, biopsy or blood tests,\u201d says Dr\u202fIfeoma\u202fEjikeme, Medical Director and Founder of Adonia Medical Clinic in London. It is why Bryony Firth-Bernard, 28, from Gloucestershire, England decided to see a dermatologist in real life to get some help with her severe acne. \u201cI decided to see a dermatologist face-to-face because I\u2019d tried using an online service and there was no change in my skin. Seeing someone was the best money I\u2019ve ever spent. I was put on Roaccutane, which requires blood tests and is not something to be taken lightly, but it was transformative,\u201d she told CNN in a phone interview. \u201cI understand why people would choose a digi dermatologist, acne crushes your confidence, and you\u2019ll do anything to fix it, and it works for some people, but what I needed could only be prescribed by someone in person.\u201d Even if you do not require in-person treatment, the absence of human contact might not be for everyone. Christal Alert, 29, founder and CEO of Tonal Cosmetics based in New York used online dermatology service Apostrophe to treat severe acne and hyperpigmentation and has mixed feelings about the experience. \u201cAlthough it was not a total transformation, my skin did get a bit better and I would recommend the digital dermatologist route,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy and hassle-free but I felt direct communication with the dermatologist on a virtual call to discuss treatment options in more detail would have enhanced the experience. As with any treatment, it may require further trial and error to find the perfect solution.\u201d If you do decide to dip your toe, be sure to do your homework. \u201cLook at the platform\u2019s reputation and track record in delivering accurate diagnoses and treatment recommendations. Ask who the provider is, and whether they have the correct credentials and training to give skin or skincare recommendations,\u201d advised Dr Ejikeme. \u201cCheck how the platforms ensures privacy and data security, and check what the process is for follow-up consultations and referrals when more help is needed.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/style/digital-dermatology-rise/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_style_louis-vuitton-pietro-beccari-olympics", "text": "There are familiar sights synonymous with every Olympics and Paralympics \u2014 emotional athletes, jubilant crowds, stands filled with colorful flags. And at next month\u2019s upcoming Games, Louis Vuitton are hoping they too will become a hallmark of the same grand occasion. The luxury house\u2019s distinctive Damier checkerboard trunks will house the Olympic torch as it travels across France, and Vuitton has created medal cases for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Seven French athletes \u2014 from fencer Enzo Lefort and swimmer L\u00e9on Marchand to wheelchair tennis champion Pauline D\u00e9roul\u00e8de and para-cyclist Marie Patouillet \u2014 will also act as ambassadors for the brand. The Olympics, and the extraordinary journeys that athletes take to reach them, closely align with the values at the heart of the French luxury fashion house, its chairman and CEO Pietro Beccari told CNN in an interview at the brand\u2019s headquarters in Paris. \u201cWe talk about excellence, we spoke about quality, we spoke about being prepared for every challenge, and that is something that is very close to our heart,\u201d Beccari said, adding that Louis Vuitton is \u201cvery proud to be a French group\u201d and willing to support its home Olympics in the \u201cmost beautiful city in the world.\u201d As one would expect from a company who also designs the trophy trunks for such events as the soccer World Cup and the F1 Grand Prix de Monaco, these are no ordinary pieces of luggage. The interiors of both trunks are lined with matte black leather; one featuring circular \u201csockets\u201d in its base and lid to safely house and transport the Olympic torch, while the other contains enough drawers to store hundreds of medals. LVMH \u2013 the luxury conglomerate that owns Louis Vuitton \u2013 spent \u20ac150 million ($163 million) on its sponsorship deal with the Olympics, Vogue reported citing sources, though calculating the precise returns on this investment is \u201cdifficult,\u201d said Beccari.  \u201cWe believe this campaign is building values, building desirability,\u201d he said. \u201cQuantifying it is very difficult, not that we didn\u2019t try but it\u2019s very very difficult or impossible.\u201d The fashion house has long associated itself with sport, sponsoring nautical events like the Americas Cup, as well as launching a recent campaign centered around the friendship of tennis legends Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. \u201cWe are very close to sport,\u201d Beccari said, recalling the slogan \u201cVictory travels in Louis Vuitton,\u201d the fashion house used when one of its trunks housed the FIFA World Cup in 2010. \u201cI think it incarnates very well the DNA of Louis Vuitton, of what I was saying before, the challenges, the willingness to overcome yourself, to reach your destination and to be willing to go and discover more.\u201d This messaging underpinned a new campaign with Federer and Nadal sitting on a Louis Vuitton case on a snowy mountain in the Dolomites, discussing their rivalry, their biggest achievements and their sporting heroes. They\u2019re \u201ctwo beautiful young people that started from their little villages respectively in two different parts of Europe,\u201d Beccari said, \u201cand they became who they became so it\u2019s really part of this philosophy of excellence, of quality, of envy to surpass yourself over time again.\u201d While Louis Vuitton posted record profits last year and LVMH outperformed other luxury brands, the current economic environment with rising inflation leaving consumers with less disposable income poses challenges ahead, though Beccari downplayed such difficulties. \u201cIn terms of crisis, you always have to have the courage to see the opportunities and that\u2019s what we do,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there is a curve, and we like to do the curve with speed, so when the road will be straight again we\u2019ll have sufficient speed to be ahead of the others.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/style/louis-vuitton-pietro-beccari-olympics/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_style_first-lady-jill-biden-vogue-cover-2024", "text": "First lady Dr. Jill Biden is Vogue\u2019s August cover star just as election season is kicking off in earnest in the United States \u2014 and only days after President Joe Biden\u2019s shaky first debate performance rattled the Democratic party. On the cover \u2014 her second for the fashion magazine \u2014 Dr. Biden appears in a cream-colored Ralph Lauren silk tuxedo dress, lensed by the veteran fashion photographer Norman Jean Roy. The accompanying profile, by Maya Singer, was written pre-debate, as the Vogue writer shadowed FLOTUS during two April campaign stops in Minnesota: one to speak to the coalition Women for Biden-Harris in Minneapolis, and another to speak to Educators for Biden-Harris. \u201cWe are the first generation in half a century to give our daughters a country with fewer rights than we had,\u201d she said in her speech at the first event, according to Vogue. \u201cBook bans. Voting laws gutted. Court decisions that strip away our most basic freedoms. But circumstance is not destiny. \u2026 When our bodies are on the line, when our daughters\u2019 futures are at stake, when our country and its freedom hang in the balance, we are immovable and unstoppable.\u201d Following the first presidential debate by President Biden and former President Trump, which was moderated by CNN on June 27, Biden advisers told CNN that his family continued their steadfast support in his bid for reelection. Vogue, too, reached out to the first lady following the debate amid calls for the president to step down as the Democratic nominee. She told the magazine that they \u201cwill not let those 90 minutes define the four years he\u2019s been president. We will continue to fight.\u201d Over those past four years, Biden has stepped into her role as FLOTUS with a hands-on approach. Earlier this year, the White House announced her new, critical initiative to fund research into a range of women\u2019s health issues that have been vastly understudied, from endometriosis to heart disease. As an English professor at Northern Virginia Community College, she\u2019s been an advocate for increased funding for in-school help for students particularly as the Covid-19 pandemic strained school systems and left gaps in education. And, as she told Vogue, she\u2019s seen the career-related frustrations of military spouses due to the often transient nature of their lives, so she has supported flexibility for remote work for some government jobs. \u201cReally, in so many different areas, I tell him what I\u2019m seeing, what I\u2019m hearing, and he gets it,\u201d she said of her husband. \u201cAnd this is where the magic happens.\u201d The first lady\u2019s sleeves-rolled-up approach is often reflected in her wardrobe. She favors a polished but practical style, from power suits and classic trenches to clothes with simple messaging (like her embellished \u201clove\u201d jacket at the G7 summit that\u00a0drew\u00a0contrasts to her predecessor\u2019s infamous \u201cI really don\u2019t care, do u?\u201d fashion statement). She places emphasis on American designers, often wearing pieces by Sergio Hudson, Michael Kors and Ralph Lauren. Following up on the periwinkle blue suit she wore at the presidential debate, she wore a black dress with white lettering by Christian Siriano at a North Carolina rally the next morning meant to re-energize voters. Her choice of garment conveyed her point loud and clear: \u201cVote,\u201d it repeated all over. However the political path forward unfolds, the first lady is sure to be key to the president\u2019s decisions. In Vogue\u2019s cover story, political journalist and author Katie Rogers noted that Dr. Biden is often not counted as one of the president\u2019s key advisers, but that she\u2019s \u201chis gut check and closest confidant.\u201d In the interview, the first lady struck a hopeful chord, but warned against the polarization that has split the country. \u201cWe don\u2019t need more chaos,\u201d she said. \u201cFundamentally, Americans care about each other. And this anger and animosity and divisiveness\u2026 it\u2019s not who we are. We\u2019re good people.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/style/first-lady-jill-biden-vogue-cover-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "style_zaha-hadid-architects-muscat-oman-waterfront-development-spc", "text": "Oman\u2019s capital of Muscat is set to get an expansive $1.3 billion waterfront development, designed by globally renowned Zaha Hadid Architects (ZHA). The 3.3 million square-meter Al Khuwair Muscat Downtown and Waterfront development will include a residential complex, a marina, a cultural district, numerous canal walkways and a ministerial campus. Work is set to start at the end of this year and the area is expected to house more than 60,000 people when completed. ZHA\u2019s associate director, architect Paolo Zilli, told CNN he spent around a year finalizing the model he presented to Oman\u2019s Ministry of Housing and Urban Planning. Central to ZIlli\u2019s design was facilitating access to public transport. \u201cThe vision is actually to remove all the cars, to remove all the fences and to create a campus of the ministry with many functions that can attract families and a new generation,\u201d he said. ZHA says it will encourage pedestrians by providing shading and passive cooling, and incorporate infrastructure to improve cycling safety. The use of onsite solar power will be \u201cmaximized\u201d and native plant species will be conserved and restored.

{"id": "2024_05_24_style_parties-monaco-grand-prix-f1", "text": "The Monaco Grand Prix gets underway this weekend in Monte Carlo with its heady combination of glamor and adrenaline, not only for the tens of thousands who descend on the pristine principality, but for the millions watching across the world. Even those who are typically indifferent to motorsports can find themselves enraptured, or at least intrigued, by the sheer spectacle of Formula One cars hurtling along the country\u2019s winding streets. It is also where you will find celebrities happily jostling their way through the crowds and cameras. \u201cIt is unlike anything I have ever been to, it is electric,\u201d exclaimed Spider-Man actor Tom Holland while walking last year\u2019s grid. And of course, there is plenty of wealth on display. Monaco is nicknamed \u201cthe billionaires\u2019 playground\u201d for good reason. Here, designer stores, supercars, multi-million-dollar yachts and astronomically priced restaurants are \u2018la norme\u2019, but during the three-day Grand Prix, the eye-watering ostentation increases three-fold. When demand is high and options are limited, it is all to play for among the world\u2019s wealthiest who are keen to revel in the race\u2019s iconic location and party \u2018til dawn. If they are not using their own superyacht as a base, they might book into a private villa on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur or check-in to Fairmont Hotel, H\u00f4tel Hermitage or H\u00f4tel de Paris in Monte Carlo itself. A pioneer of Grand Prix party culture Of course, it is not only about finding the finest suites to rest your head, but the premium spots for dining and clubbing, whether it is the top table at Cipriani, Sass Caf\u00e9 or Caf\u00e9 de Paris or the best booth at exclusive night spots such as Jimmy\u2019z or Amber Lounge. The latter has the distinction of being the go-to destination for the F1 fraternity, including Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen, while previous guests have included Justin Bieber, Kim Kardashian, Kylie Minogue and Prince Albert of Monaco. Established in 2003 by former racing driver Eddie Irvine\u2019s sister Sonia as a \u201cpost-race destination\u201d for drivers and VIP guests, Amber Lounge is regarded a pioneer of the Grand Prix party culture. Notably, it will be marking its 20-year milestone (there was a year off during Covid) as \u201cthe most exclusive party in the world\u201d with panache over the Monaco weekend with three nights of events costing just over \u20ac1.5m ($1.6m) to produce. There will be after parties at an Amber Lounge beach club on the terrace of Le Meridien Beach Plaza (the only hotel in Monte Carlo with its own private beach), as well as VIP viewing of the race from aboard a 108ft superyacht moored just feet from the circuit\u2019s famous Tabac corner. \u201cThe size of the yacht also means we are as close to the action as you can get, unlike the larger yachts that are pulled back (from the coast). It also feels more intimate and exclusive on board. We have a lot of repeat clients (typically from the US, UK and Middle East) who want to network and build relationships,\u201d said Lauren Green, Managing Director of Amber Lounge who oversees logistics of the three-day pop-up event in Monaco, as well as other F1 locations including Singapore, Las Vegas and Abu Dhabi. Unsurprisingly, a ticket to one of the most coveted trackside spots does not come cheap. A one-day VIP viewing package for the race itself on Sunday costs \u20ac3,500 ($3,800) per person \u2014 and the 65 available tickets sold out within two weeks of going on sale in May 2023. While the dress code is \u2018Riviera chic,\u2019 shoes, however expensive, must be discarded on embarking so as not to ruin the yacht\u2019s teak decking. Tickets include free-flowing beverages, including champagne, wine and signature cocktails, as well as food, a DJ and dancers before tenders return to shore at 6.30pm. \u2018The center of the universe for a weekend\u2019 At the club\u2019s after parties held over the race weekend, a small army of waiting staff serve ever-flowing drinks for a 1000 strong crowd on Saturday and Sunday nights. On arrival, guests ring a bell and a gloved hand appears through a flower wall proffering a glass of champagne. Attendees have paid anything from \u20ac600 ($650) for entry to the afterparty on Saturday (the F1 qualifying day) to \u20ac800 ($870) on the Sunday (race day) in the hope they can party alongside drivers, celebrities and guests of high net worth, away from the public gaze. For \u20ac40,000 ($43,400), partygoers can book what\u2019s known as a \u201cdiamond table package\u201d for 10 people \u2014 a prime table with unobstructed views of the stage and DJ booth (Fatman Scoop and Jax Jones are the acts for 2024), as well as cirqus-themed performances, and Methuselahs of champagne (6-liters) and premium vodka. Add an extra \u20ac10,000 ($10,800) on for a Salmanazar \u2014 a nine-liter bottle of champagne that requires a team of four to carry it to the table, or \u20ac20,000 ($21,600) for a 12-liter Balthazar-sized bottle. The top-tier tables also have their own \u201chosts,\u201d who act as a concierge; liaising with VIPs\u2019 assistants or drivers to ensure guests can be greeted and escorted along the black carpet without having to queue. Amber Lounge might be one of the most exclusive and expensive events taking place during the Monaco Grand Prix weekend, but Monte Carlo itself is a veritable party hub. It\u2019s common for champagne glasses and bottles to be cleared from the track from the previous night\u2019s revelry ahead of that day\u2019s qualifying or race sessions. \u201cThe C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur is one of the truly exceptional global destinations, and Monaco is at the heart of it. The scenery, the sophistication, and the opulence are unmatched,\u201d said Bruce Bundrant, Senior Vice President of Business Development for rEvolution, a global sports marketing agency who lived in Monaco for three years as Commercial Director for AS Monaco FC. \u201cAs a former resident, I can tell you there are two sides to the F1 Grand Prix arriving in Monaco. On one side, your town is now the center of the universe for a weekend where the top 1% of the 1% from all over the world arrive and engage in outrageous parties and events on yachts, at luxury hotels suites, and in hilltop mansions,\u201d Bundrant explained. \u201cOn the other, it\u2019s the hybrid of the arrival of a hurricane and New Year\u2019s Eve. A week out from the race, grocery store shelves are emptied as locals know it\u2019s impossible to move around the principality when the F1 circus is in town. During the Grand Prix, your quiet, regular neighborhood bar has a line around the corner, charges a $100 cover charge, and a drink that typically costs $20 will be $50. But it\u2019s a truly unforgettable weekend, with an unreplicable buzz and energy. Sure, it\u2019s expensive, but come the Monday, things are back to normal.\u201d As normal as it can ever be in a place as excessive as Monaco. As the jet set move onto their next port of call, and the racetrack is dismantled, so too is the Amber Lounge club as preparations continue for their next F1 event, which will be Singapore in September. \u201cThere is no rest at Amber Lounge,\u201d Green quipped. \u201cJust a lot of adrenaline. And a lot of coffee.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/style/parties-monaco-grand-prix-f1/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_style_anant-ambani-radhika-merchant-wedding-preview-intl-hnk", "text": "Billionaire heir Anant Ambani is set to marry his longtime girlfriend Radhika Merchant later this month, in a lavish ceremony widely described as the country\u2019s wedding of the year. Extravagant pre-wedding celebrations have already sent Indian media into a frenzy and social media feeds are abuzz over what\u2019s to come. In March, the couple had a three-day pre-wedding party in the western city of Jamnagar, attended by around 1,200 high-profile guests, including Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates. An elaborate light show featuring 5,500 drones lit up the sky above a glass palace custom-built for the festivities where partygoers danced the night away to a performance by none other than Rihanna. Then, over a weekend in late May, the couple held a four-day Mediterranean cruise for friends and family, which made multiple stops through Europe, and included a bevy of Bollywood A-listers, with performances by Katy Perry, the Backstreet Boys and opera star Andrea Bocelli. The Mumbai wedding is set to take place July 12 to 14 at the home of Anant\u2019s parents Mukesh and Nita Ambani \u2013 a 27-story residence called Antilia \u2013 as well as the family-owned Jio World Convention Centre, a sprawling venue with a capacity for more than 16,000 people. Details have been tightly guarded, but if the pre-wedding events are anything to go by, the upcoming nuptials are expected to be grand. Here\u2019s what we know. Who are the bride and groom? Ambani, 29, is the youngest son of Asia\u2019s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, who has an estimated fortune of $118 billion, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His son is responsible for driving the expansion of the energy sector of the family\u2019s conglomerate, Reliance Industries. The youngest of three siblings, Ambani graduated from Brown University. His brother and sister are on the board of Reliance and manage other parts of the company. Anant has been concerned about animal welfare since childhood. He recently launched his passion project, Vantara, a 3,000-acre animal shelter, which was toured by VIP guests dressed in jungle-themed attire during the pre-wedding party in Jamnagar. Merchant, 29, is the daughter of pharma tycoon Viren Merchant, and works for his company, Encore Healthcare. A graduate of New York University, she told Vogue that she met Ambani through mutual friends during a drive in 2017. \u201cThat first meeting just sparked something special between us, and it wasn\u2019t long before we started dating,\u201d she said.  Merchant is also formally trained in Bharatnatyam, a form of Indian classical dance. Speaking of his wife to-be, Ambani said during a speech in Jamnagar: \u201cI am 100% the lucky one. It feels like I met Radhika yesterday, but every day, I fall more and more in love.\u201d What can we expect at the wedding? In keeping with Hindu tradition, the couple\u2019s wedding dates were reportedly chosen according to auspicious days on their birth charts. Hindu weddings typically include several events and take place over more than one day. The festivities usually include a haldi ceremony, where guests apply turmeric paste on the bride and groom\u2019s arms and face for good luck and protection from evil spirits. Then there\u2019s the mehndi, a ritual where an artist paints intricate henna patterns on to the hands of the bride and guests. The night before the wedding is usually reserved for the sangeet, when the bride and groom\u2019s wedding party dances for guests. According to a leaked wedding invitation posted by ANI, one of India\u2019s largest news agencies, festivities will kick off on July 12 with the \u201cShubh Vivaah\u201d or \u201causpicious wedding\u201d ceremony. The following day is the \u201cShubh Aashirwad\u201d or \u201cdivine blessing\u201d ceremony, and festivities conclude on July 14 with the \u201cMangal Utsav\u201d or reception. The invitation was placed in an ornate red box with a depiction of the Hindu god Vishnu on its front, according to a video published by ANI. Manish Malhotra, one of the country\u2019s most famous designers, has been appointed as the wedding\u2019s creative director, collaborating with Nita Ambani and numerous vendors to execute the family\u2019s vision. Malhotra told CNN that he built on Nita\u2019s \u201cvisionary approach,\u201d with his team creating themes and experiences for the wedding that \u201cembody the essence of India while reflecting the couple\u2019s distinct personalities.\u201d \u201cEach detail, from the decor and cuisine to the attire and ambiance; each event, from the vibrant Sangeet to the ceremonial wedding day and the grand reception, is designed to immerse guests in an atmosphere of joy, love and celebration,\u201d he explained via e-mail. What can we expect from the wedding fashion? The bride and groom are expected to wear statement-making attire showcasing Indian craft and textiles, homegrown talent as well as pieces imbued with symbolism. The couple\u2019s outfits worn in the pre-wedding events included striking pieces from top Indian designers, such as Malhotra, Sabyasachi Mukherjee and Tarun Tahiliani. Malhotra designed two lehengas that Merchant wore to the pre-wedding bash. The golden garment was studded with 20,000 Swarovski crystals and employed the knowledge of over 70 artisans while an Art Deco inspired blue lehenga took 5,700 hours to make. Ambani\u2019s looks have also been bold. At one of the events in Jamnagar, he wore an ivory sherwani, a traditional Indian two-piece suit, designed by Rohit Bal, with a custom brooch by Lorraine Schwartz. Luxury\u00a0fashion labels have been seen alongside up-and-coming labels. Merchant wore Versace during the March celebrations \u2014 a custom pink version of the gown previously worn by Blake Lively at the 2022 Met Gala. On the Mediterranean cruise, Merchant wore a black and white gown designed by Hong Kong-born Robert Wun, with a love letter from her fiance printed onto the chiffon skirt. Coordinating with Merchant, Ambani also wore a custom black suit designed by Wun, encrusted with jewels. For the July wedding, Malhotra said his team has \u201cdedicated several months of meticulous craftsmanship to create exquisite pieces.\u201d While he was unable to reveal the details of the garments ahead of the occasion, he said work on some of them began before the pre-wedding celebrations. At the upcoming wedding, guests are expected to dress in \u201ctraditional Indian\u201d attire on Friday, according to the wedding invitation, which could include a saree for women, and a kurta \u2013 loosely fitted pants with a tunic \u2013 for men. Guests have been asked to wear \u201cIndian formal\u201d attire the following day and \u201cIndian chic\u201d for Sunday\u2019s reception event. Malhotra described the \u201cIndian chic\u201d dress code as something that \u201cmarries traditional Indian elements with contemporary fashion.\u201d For the couple, he said, this translates into \u201cstriking ensembles that honor our rich cultural heritage while reflecting their personal style. Think of intricate embroidery and innovative silhouettes that capture both tradition and modernity.\u201d As for the guests, Malhotra said, we can expect to see \u201ctimeless sarees and lehengas paired with modern blouses, or traditional sherwanis with a contemporary twist. \u201cThe key is to celebrate Indian craftsmanship while embracing a sophisticated, stylish aesthetic that feels both timeless and fresh.\u201d What it takes to pull off a wedding on this scale An event of this magnitude takes months to plan and likely involves hundreds of people working behind the scenes to make it happen. \u201cAny kind of mega project like this usually requires about nine to 12 months of preparation work, and there is the involvement of nearly 40 to 45 big agencies or partners,\u201d Mareesha Parikh, a Mumbai-based wedding planner and founder of Swaaha Weddings, told CNN on a phone call. Separate teams will likely be dealing with reservations, securing entertainment, managing production design, handling logistics, among others tasks on the day, she added. India\u2019s wedding industry has dramatically evolved over the last decade, with Bollywood and celebrity culture inspiring couples to throw grander and even more expensive affairs. But with the intense public fascination with Ambani and Merchant\u2019s wedding, also comes some criticism. To some, the opulence of the event stands in stark contrast to the poverty affecting tens of millions in the country, and points to what critics say is an increasing wealth gap between the rich and poor. The Ambanis, aware of their privilege, have carried out charitable acts before some of the celebrations. On Tuesday, they staged a mass wedding for 50 \u201cunderprivileged\u201d couples in the city, gifting them jewellery as well as household items and groceries for a year. Now valued at\u00a0around $130 billion,\u00a0according to the Confederation of All India Traders,\u00a0the wedding sector is country\u2019s fourth largest industry, employing millions of people. In December, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a \u201cwed in India\u201d campaign to keep the money spent on weddings inside the country. \u201cAreas of specialization have also grown,\u201d Parikh said. \u201cTake gift hampers for example. We used to source those and wrap them ourselves. Now there\u2019s a separate agency that does the sourcing and a separate agency that does the packaging.\u201d Vanessa Almeida, the Goa-based owner of The Gift House, who was responsible for packaging some 8,000 gifts for Ambani\u2019s guests in Jamnagar told CNN she was in the city for two weeks to ensure all the preparations were going to plan. \u201cDuring the event, we were asked not to take photos of the event, of the people or of the work that we were doing,\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cThey had very respectfully even asked the guests not to do so as they had their own teams capturing everything.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/style/anant-ambani-radhika-merchant-wedding-preview-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_03_27_style_titanic-door-prop-auction-planet-hollywood", "text": "It\u2019s one of the most iconic, and hotly-debated, props in cinematic history: The floating wood panel that spared Kate Winslet\u2019s \u201cTitanic\u201d character Rose DeWitt Bukater from icy North Atlantic waters after the titular ocean liner\u2019s sinking \u2014 but not Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s Jack Dawson. And it\u2019s now been sold at auction for more than $700,000. \u201cOften mistakenly referred to as a door, the ornate structure was in reality part of the door frame just above the first-class lounge entrance,\u201d Heritage Auctions wrote in the auction notes. The prop\u2019s pivotal role in the \u201cbig scene, big goodbye\u201d moment, as the auction house had described it, features Rose floating on the floral-carved panel as Jack, having tried and failed to also rest atop, has succumbed to the cold. As a rescue boat arrives, Rose is forced to pry her hand from his frozen grip \u2014 while uttering the famous line \u201cI\u2019ll never let go, I promise,\u201d through chattering teeth \u2014 as she swims to her rescuers. The ornate balsa wood panel had previously been displayed at a Planet Hollywood in Orlando, Florida before being stored in their archives for some two decades, the auction house told CNN. It was sold alongside a roster of other props at the \u201cTreasures From Planet Hollywood\u201d auction, which included memorabilia items once displayed at Planet Hollywood locations worldwide and from its archives. These included pieces such as the whip from\u00a0\u201cIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\u201d and the ax from \u201cThe Shining.\u201d Across almost 1,600 lots in total, the five-day-long auction brought in $15.7 million, according\u00a0to a press release. But the \u201cTitanic\u201d flotsam took the prize for the highest-priced piece, far exceeding its starting price of $40,000 and selling for a grand total of $718,750 following a high-energy bidding war. Several other \u201cTitanic\u201d props were also put up for sale, including the pastel chiffon evening gown Rose wears in the movie on the night of the sinking and the ship\u2019s helm wheel, which sold for $118,750 and $200,000 respectively. A 2012 episode of the Discovery show \u201cMythBusters\u201d infamously found that two people could have survived long enough on the panel \u2014 which measures approximately eight feet (2.4 meters) long and just over three feet (1 meter) wide \u2014 if they added a life jacket for extra buoyancy. Remarking on the results, however, \u201cTitanic\u201d director James Cameron told the show\u2019s hosts, Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage, that Jack needed to die regardless. And in 2022, Cameron, alongside a hypothermia expert, tried to put an end to the debate once and for all with a\u00a0simulated test\u00a0to see if two people of the same body mass as Winslet and DiCaprio could have really stayed afloat on a piece of wood of the same size. Their final answer was no, it was not possible. There was no additional testing of these theories on the prop itself prior to its sale, as the auction house chooses to \u201chandle all items with great care when in transit and in storage,\u201d Heritage Auctions told CNN. But its new owner, who is choosing to remain anonymous, could well be planning a pool day, having been drawn in by the allure of the over two-decade-long mystery. \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is this massive interest in the films of the 1980s and 1990s,\u201d said Joe Maddalena, executive vice president of Heritage Auctions, in a statement. \u201cThere has been a generational shift to where these massive franchises of the 1980s and 1990s \u2014 the \u2018Home Alone\u2019s, the \u2018Indiana Jones\u2019 films, the \u2018Die Hard\u2019s \u2014 are now collectors\u2019 favorites\u2026 Collectors are finally rewarding these artifacts as what they are: cultural artifacts akin to the fine art of old.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/style/titanic-door-prop-auction-planet-hollywood/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_style_jesus-ai-artificial-intelligence-social-media-cec", "text": "AI images have become an unavoidable roadside attraction on Facebook and other social media, where dramatic and outlandish depictions of emotional scenes lure users into doling out likes, shares and \u201cAmens.\u201d Among the funhouse images of fake children crying in the street and police officers saving inexplicably huge Bibles from the rain, countless depictions of Jesus Christ seem to take up an outsized amount of AI real estate. It makes sense. The central figure of Christianity invokes potent reactions from billions of followers around the globe. For the last 2,000 years, faithful hands have labored to create likenesses of their professed savior, projecting onto him various theologies and mythologies combined with aesthetics of the time: Jesus suffering on the cross, Jesus as the Good Shepherd, Jesus the creator of miracles, Jesus the word made flesh, Jesus as cosmic judge. Now, in the age of AI, Jesus can assume an infinite variety of roles with just a few keystrokes. Jesus as a durian fruit, for instance. Or Jesus battling shirtless with Satan. Sometimes, Jesus is cuddling a person in need in a hospital bed, his chiseled features and strong hands providing divine comfort. None of these things are in the Bible, but they are alive in the minds of particularly imaginative Christians, or just those who want some easy engagement on Facebook. What\u2019s unsettling is how many AI-created images of Jesus are unnecessarily handsome and rugged, like one of those Instagram influencers who wears a lot of pendants and is always wandering barefoot through an island jungle. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that, per se. The Bible doesn\u2019t get specific about Jesus\u2019 looks, and certainly artists over the millennia have taken creative license when it comes to his physique (and, to a different point, his skin tone). However, generative AI, like the kind that can create images from text prompts, doesn\u2019t work like an artist\u2019s brain. All of these handsome AI Jesus images are created from patterns a machine picks up from the information it is fed. What does that say about us, and how we view the figures most important to our cultural identities? The aesthetics of religious figures Since programs that generate AI art are trained on existing forms of art and imagery, the conundrum of handsome AI Jesus has two parts: How Jesus has been depicted in the images fed to such machines, and how the machines interpret the images they are given in order to spit out new ones. We\u2019ll start with the historical part first. \u201cDepicting religious figures in an idealized form far predates Christianity,\u201d says art historian and former classics professor Brenda Sanderson. \u201cGreeks and Romans portrayed their gods in a way that depicted strength and good health. While certain images of Jesus may not be intended to be sexual, they reflect a formal ideal that corresponds with the spiritual ideal.\u201d Sanderson also says some of these depictions merely reflect the sensibilities of the artist. The Sistine Chapel ceiling, painted by Michelangelo between 1508 and 1512, is considered one of the crowning achievements of sacred art. While its vibrant frescoes illustrate saints, prophets and characters of the Bible, it also includes a full-on depiction of God\u2019s bare behind. \u201cThings like that that some may consider sacreligious today weren\u2019t quite as scandalous at the time,\u201d she says. The question of whether a religious depiction is \u201ctoo sexy\u201d doesn\u2019t stop with Jesus. A very famous pair of sculptures created for St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral in Li\u00e8ge, Belgium in the 1800s has become a beloved part of art history lore. The first, \u201cL\u2019ange du mal,\u201d was created by artist Joseph Geefs, but was removed from the church because church officials worried about its effect on female worshipers and reportedly said, \u201cthe devil is too sublime.\u201d It was replaced by a different sculpture by Geefs\u2019 brother, Guillaume. However, in a humorous twist, many art lovers consider \u201cLe g\u00e9nie du mal\u201d to be even more suggestive than the original. Even today, the question of sexualized religious images in art is alive and well. In early 2024, a \u201csexualized\u201d painting of Jesus by Spanish artist Salustiano Garc\u00eda Cruz was decried as \u201coffensive\u201d and \u201cevil\u201d by critics. \u201cBiblical figures and saints have often been made attractive or \u2018sexy\u2019 in art history, whether it\u2019s images of the scantily-clad young Saint Sebastian pierced by arrows, the naked body of Mary Magdalene covered only by her hair, or the muscular torso of Christ in works by Michelangelo and others,\u201d art historian Morgan Haigh told the BBC about Garc\u00eda\u2019s work. How AI interprets art Now that we know there is a long history of humans depicting their religious figures in, well, idealized form, the prevalence of handsome AI Jesus makes more sense. Christopher Framer, a generative AI certified programmer from Petaluma, California, explains that different AI models are trained on different pieces of art, and the outcome relies on a person\u2019s input as well. \u201cFrom a consumer view you can\u2019t usually tell what kind of images an AI model has been fed, but what is generated can vary on other specifications like image type \u2014 does the person specify they want a photorealistic image? You see a lot of those on Facebook.\u201d Framer says other inputs can greatly vary the images, like the addition of words like \u201cstrong,\u201d \u201cfighting,\u201d or \u201cpower.\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you for sure, but when people are looking to create images that elicit a specific response, they just need to add a single word or describe a situation, and that can create a huge difference.\u201d That\u2019s one reason why some depictions of AI Jesus include curious details, like tattoos, bulging biceps, hairy chests or soulful dreamboat eyes. \u201cThese programs don\u2019t actually know who Jesus is, or what he means. They know, through what they\u2019ve been fed, that most images of Jesus may look a certain way. Adding more into a prompt introduces more information into the image that may be at odds with what people think a religious image should look like.\u201d AI-generated images are becoming somewhat of a problem on social media, where engaging with a religious picture may take half a second and doesn\u2019t necessitate a close look at the content. Many AI photos of Jesus online also include elements of patriotism or politics, which, through Framer\u2019s explanation, alter the nature of the depiction. There are other complications that lead to the persistence of handsome AI Jesus. Some AI art experts fear the more AI images that are created, the more the programs that run them will create a kind of \u201cfeedback loop,\u201d where the same type of images get generated over and over again. These images attract thousands of likes and comments as people scroll by them, despite, at times, being very obviously manipulated. Many pages offering this kind of content also contain links to questionable websites, spam-like hashtags or repeated variations of the same type of image. All in all, it\u2019s not a very human experience.

{"id": "2024_06_03_style_franz-kafka-letter-writers-block-auction-intl-scli", "text": "A letter giving a rare insight into Franz Kafka\u2019s struggle with writer\u2019s block is going up for auction. Best-known for the 1915 novella \u201cThe Metamorphosis,\u201d the Prague-born Jewish writer struggled throughout his short life with anxiety, hopelessness and isolation \u2013 themes that came to define his work \u2013 but little has been known about his creative process. The one-page letter, which is expected to sell for \u00a370,000 to \u00a390,000 ($89,000 to $115,000) at Sotheby\u2019s in London, is dated to spring 1920, according to the auction house. This means it would have been written while Kafka was undergoing treatment for tuberculosis, with which he was diagnosed three years earlier. He took intermittent sick leave from his job with an insurance company and would often spend periods at sanatoriums. He retired in 1922 and died in a clinic near Vienna two years later. \u201cI haven\u2019t written anything for three years, what\u2019s published now are old things, I don\u2019t have any other work, not even started,\u201d Kafka lamented in the letter, written in German and addressed to his friend, the Austrian poet Albert Ehrenstein. Giving a reason for this literary dry spell, Kafka wrote: \u201cWhen worries have penetrated to a certain layer of inner existence, writing and complaining obviously cease, indeed my resistance was not too strong.\u201d The letter was written in response to Ehrenstein asking him to contribute to his magazine, Sotheby\u2019s said in a media statement issued Monday. Ehrenstein made the request after seeing a newly published work by Kafka \u2013 probably the 1919 short story collection \u201cEin Landarzt\u201d (\u201cA Country Doctor\u201d). \u201cThe life and works of Franz Kafka have long been a source of fascination throughout the world,\u201d Sotheby\u2019s Books & Manuscripts specialist Gabriel Heaton said in the release. \u201cThe letter reveals how writing made intense demands on him, and required deep reserves of inner strength, as he grappled with deep insecurity and worry about the futility of his work. We can also all be thankful that Kafka would continue to pick up his pen despite his crippling writer\u2019s block,\u201d he added. At the time the letter was written, Kafka had also begun an intense love affair with Czech journalist and writer Milena Jesensk\u00e1. So, despite his physical health continuing to decline, Kafka was given renewed confidence with Jesensk\u00e1\u2019s support and was able to begin his final literary endeavors, including \u201cA Hunger Artist\u201d and \u201cThe Castle,\u201d according to the release. Both these books were published posthumously, in 1924 and 1926, respectively \u2013 despite Kafka requesting that his unpublished manuscripts be destroyed upon his death. Though he was sought out by avant-garde publishers during his life, Kafka\u2019s greatest literary acclaim came posthumously. His works, all written in German, were rediscovered in Germany and Austria after 1945, and he began to have a huge influence on German literature that extended globally by the 1960s. They have been widely adapted for the cinema, TV and theater. The auction will run from June 26 to July 10.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/style/franz-kafka-letter-writers-block-auction-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_03_29_style_kim-kardashian-donald-judd-furniture-cec", "text": "Kim Kardashian\u2019s oft-divisive interior design aesthetic is under new scrutiny. The estate of minimalist contemporary artist Donald Judd filed a lawsuit against Kardashian this week, claiming the fashion and beauty mogul promoted \u201ccheap knockoffs\u201d of his furniture designs. The basis of the suit is a 2022 video Kardashian posted to YouTube, in which she gives a guided tour of the offices for her then-brand new makeup company, Skkn by Kim. (The video, which the suit alleged received some 3.7 million views, was seemingly made private following the lawsuit filing.) While touting her office\u2019s minimalist design, Kardashian specifically praises a sleek, large-scale wooden table with a set of matching chairs that are perfectly sized to slide beneath \u2014 creating a piece resembling less a dining table and more a brutalist sculpture. \u201cThese Donald Judd tables are really amazing and totally blend in with the seats,\u201d Kardashian says, moving a chair out to show the camera. An artist and sculptor, Judd was known for his minimalist designs emphasizing clean whole shapes and industrial materials. As they appear in the video, the table and its matching chairs in Kardashian\u2019s office resemble Judd\u2019s famous La Mansana Table and Chair 84 \u2014 pieces that have become iconic among furniture designers and collectors since they were first produced in 1982. The Judd Foundation still manufactures and sells these designs, though they come at a cost: the table is priced at $90,000, while the chairs retail for $9,000 each. But Kardashian\u2019s wares were not authentic pieces, the Judd Foundation wrote in the lawsuit filed Wednesday against both Kardashian and Clements Design, the interior design firm she worked with in designing the Skkn office space. (And even if they were, the foundation \u201ccategorically prohibits customers from using purchased Donald Judd furniture for marketing and promotional purposes,\u201d it says in its court filing.) The foundation is claiming trademark infringement, copyright infringement, unfair competition, false advertising and false endorsement of the knockoff items. \u201cConsumers who watched the video or read the media coverage were misled to believe Ms. Kardashian\u2019s tables and chairs were authentic Donald Judd pieces,\u201d the foundation states in the filing. It is seeking the profits it argues Kardashian and Clements Design made off the use of Judd\u2019s name. Clements Designs, according to the court filing, said it never claimed the tables and chairs were authentic Judd pieces, and directed the foundation to settle the issue with Kardashian. In a statement provided to CNN, the design firm said the pieces it produced for Kardashian\u2019s office had \u201cobvious key differences\u201d to Judd\u2019s designs. \u201cThe Judd Foundation\u2019s prior counsel acknowledged these differences and since then, we have not heard from them in over a year, and are now being blindsided with a lawsuit,\u201d Clements Design\u2019s statement read. \u201cEfforts were made to resolve this issue amicably at the time and the Judd Foundation was unwilling to settle on reasonable terms. These claims have absolutely no merit.\u201d To add further insult, Kardashian\u2019s knockoffs were also, the lawsuit claims, seemingly made from plywood \u2014 a material that the Judd Foundation does not authorize.\u201d \u201cThese poor-quality imitations masquerading as authentic Donald Judd tables and chairs harm the Donald Judd brand,\u201d the lawsuit argues. \u201cConsumers will see the cheap knockoffs\u2026 and erroneously associate (the) low-grade pieces with the Donald Judd brand,\u201d the lawsuit states. The foundation claimed it also offered to replace the counterfeit tables and chairs with authentic pieces at a discount if Kardashian issued a retraction and edited the video, the lawsuit claims. Representatives for Kardashian offered to promote the Judd Foundation in a social media post, which the foundation rejected, and also offered to issue a retraction in the video caption, but not remove the video, the lawsuit claims. Kardashian did not respond to requests for comment from CNN. Judd, who died in 1994, was very selective about who was allowed to manufacture and carry his designs, paying particularly close attention to the quality of materials used. Only a few galleries and stores \u2014 like the MoMA Design store and the Salon 94 gallery, both in New York \u2014 are authorized to sell his furniture.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/29/style/kim-kardashian-donald-judd-furniture-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}

At just over 9,000 square feet, the house from the \u201cHome Alone\u201d movie was last sold in 2012 for $1,585,000, according to real estate marketplace Zillow. With five bedrooms and six bathrooms, the Georgian-style property, built in 1921, has plenty of space to accommodate hijinks like those from the iconic 1990 film. \u201cIt\u2019s a chance to own a piece of cinematic history,\u201d said the Dawn McKenna Group, the real estate team selling the property, adding that it\u2019s a \u201crare opportunity to own one of the most iconic movie residences in American pop culture.\u201d The Christmas classic starred a young Macaulay Culkin as Kevin McCallister, an 8-year-old boy forced to fend for himself after his family accidentally leaves him at home during the holiday season. While Kevin\u2019s family is on holiday in Paris, he enjoys life to himself in the grand home \u2013 feasting on junk food and sledding down the stairs. But when he overhears that burglars are going to target the house, he sets up a series of booby traps to foil their plans. The home for sale is located in Winnetka, Illinois and \u201cepitomizes\u201d the classic architecture of the Chicago suburbs, the Dawn McKenna Group said in its online listing. The home was fully renovated and expanded in 2018, the listing added, but the \u201cintegrity of the home\u2019s most memorable and recognizable spaces\u201d have been maintained. Features include a \u201cmagazine-worthy gourmet kitchen with double islands,\u201d a hot tub and a movie theater.

In 2021,\u00a0fans of the movie were given the opportunity to rent the house for one night only \u2013 and for just $25. Prospective visitors were free to feast on Chicago pizza and Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, much like the youngest McAllister opted for when he was left home alone.

Teijo\u2019s age is not the only reason her participation broke barriers in the pageant world. She is also\u00a0married, a mother and previously divorced \u2013 all previous disqualifiers until last year, when the Miss Texas USA rules changed, according to\u00a0the pageant\u2019s website. Born in 1952, Teijo grew up on a cotton and maize farm in Lazbuddie, a small town in Northwest Texas. She is the second oldest of four children, and she and her siblings spoke English among themselves and Spanish to their parents, who migrated to the US\u00a0from Mexico. \u201cMy father made us work every summer, from dawn to when the sun set. But I liked it. It was a lot of walking. We had to walk up and down the rows and take out all the weeds with a hoe,\u201d Teijo recalled. She said those early days on the farm instilled a love of being active. As an adult, Teijo said she ran, exercised at the gym and even\u00a0started competing in bodybuilding competitions when she was 40. \u201cI have twelve trophies,\u201d Teijo said. For more than four decades, the grandmother of three taught second grade and was a substitute teacher. After she retired during the pandemic, she was recruited to join a modeling agency. Teijo said she was urged to compete in a local pageant, but she initially decided against it. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was something I would be able to do,\u201d Teijo said. But she changed her mind when her agent told her how much she could inspire others with her healthy lifestyle. She was already doing it in her community. \u201cI thought, \u2018Yeah, you know what. If I\u2019m already getting a few people that tell me that I\u2019m their inspiration, I can inspire a lot more,\u2019\u201d she said. But I thought it would just be Houston and El Paso.\u201d To prepare for pageant competitions, Teijo said she\u00a0hired a \u201ctough\u201d trainer and started weightlifting more intensively. She said because she\u2019s in her early 70s, she worried if she trained really hard, she\u2019d get injured. Instead, she\u2019s now in\u00a0even better shape than before. But at the pageant rehearsal last weekend, when\u00a0a choreographer instructed contestants on where to walk for each portion of the competition, Teijo said her confidence waned. \u201cThe practice was grueling. Oh my gosh. I kept making so many mistakes. I was getting nervous,\u201d she admitted. Her pageant roommate noticed her struggling with the choreography and gave her a hand. \u201cShe said, \u2018Do you want me to help you down the stairs?\u2019 I said yes because I was afraid of falling. And when she walked down the stairs, she stopped and held out her hand so I could walk down. I thought that was so kind of her,\u201d recounted Teijo. The septuagenarian said she was surprised by how accepting all the other contestants were, too. \u201cAll the girls were so nice and sweet to me, and they came up to compliment me, telling me I was beautiful and \u2018How do you get your abs?\u2019 It was just really, really nice.\u201d Despite the flubs while practicing, Teijo proudly told CNN she got it right during the competition. Aarieanna Ware, who was previously Miss Dallas, took home the title of Miss Texas USA. She\u2019s set to compete in Miss USA on August 4. After the competition was over, women of all ages waited for her in the lobby of the Hilton Houston Post Oak hotel, showering her with praise and admiration. She said positive comments have flooded her Instagram and Facebook pages, too. \u201cI wasn\u2019t as fancy and as polished as the other girls, but I did it,\u201d said Teijo. She said she knew she wouldn\u2019t win, but that wasn\u2019t her goal. It was to inspire women to be active, especially through weightlifting and healthy eating. \u201cIt\u2019s something that will keep you looking young, and you don\u2019t just do it for vanity\u2019s sake. You don\u2019t do it for beauty. It\u2019s to be healthy, to be strong and be able to do things as you get older.\u201d Things like Miss Texas USA.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/style/marissa-teijo-71-beauty-pageant-contestant-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_style_china-rihanna-fenty-beauty-promotion-intl-hnk", "text": "There\u2019s a reason why Rihanna is a billionaire. She\u2019s a business mogul in every sense: Aside from a prolific music career, she\u2019s launched successful brands including her cosmetics empire Fenty Beauty \u2013 worth an estimated $2.8 billion according to Forbes \u2013 and her lingerie label Savage X Fenty. Her latest move in China to promote makeup products is something of a masterclass in how to tap into its lucrative \u2013 mostly online \u2013 Gen Z market. On Tuesday night, the chart-topping singer attended a Fenty Beauty pop-up held at a Shanghai photography museum, \u201cservin\u2019 face\u201d according to brand\u2019s Instagram, and \u201cjianbing\u201d \u2013 a popular Chinese breakfast crepe that costs about a dollar. Dressed in a head-to-toe black ensemble, Rihanna cracked an egg, spread yolk, sprinkled scallions, brushed sauce and placed a crunchy cracker onto the savory street food favorite, made on a glittery food cart. Influential makeup bloggers invited to attend captured the spectacle and Chinese social media sprung to life. \u201cShe makes crepes but not her new album,\u201d joked one user on Douyin, China\u2019s TikTok, while another wrote on Weibo, \u201cShe\u2019s so good at it, it\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s her first time.\u201d Rihanna is already a beloved star in China, recently appearing on April\u2019s Vogue China cover. She has been viewed as appreciating Chinese culture, famously wearing a glorious golden yellow creation by master couturier Guo Pei to 2015\u2019s China-themed Met Gala. And the decision to serve up jianbing was a savvy move \u2013 one that embraced the star\u2019s moniker among Chinese fans and displayed knowledge of her audience. In 2011, Chinese fans dubbed her the \u201cQueen of Shandong,\u201d after her hit \u201cWe Found Love\u201d was phonetically translated to \u201cweifang de ai\u201d \u2013 meaning love of Weifang, a city in eastern China\u2019s Shandong province. Jianbing is believed to have originated from the same province more than 2,000 years ago and for many in China, the 36-year-old\u2019s turn at making the humble crepe was a full circle moment, with one viral comment on Weibo reading \u201cshe\u2019s certified her own Chinese nickname\u201d with the act. The jianbing buzz only added to the chatter online about the singer\u2019s appearance earlier in the day on Douyin, where she hosted three livestream sessions showcasing Fenty Beauty lip glosses, blushes and other products. Rihanna then became the number one trending topic on Weibo, with the hashtag #RihannasfirstlivestreaminChina viewed over 81 million times. Another hashtag, #RihannashowsupinShanghai was viewed over 75 million times. Besides being a video app, Douyin is a major platform for online shopping \u2013 with products and discounts displayed on-screen during livestreams and purchases just a swipe or a click away. In 2022, there were more than 460 million livestreaming e-commerce users in mainland China, according to the Academy of China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, a body affiliated with Beijing\u2019s commerce ministry. Other foreign luxury brands have already hosted their own livestream sessions, including Gucci, Dior and Louis Vuitton. China is now the world\u2019s second largest beauty market. Rihanna\u2019s appearance was part of the platform\u2019s wider \u201c618\u201d (or June 18) campaign, one of China\u2019s most important online shopping events after Singles Day in November, that sees widespread promotions starting nearly a month ahead. While Fenty Beauty products have been available in the country since 2019, the brand announced this March that it would be expanding its presence via Sephora stores on the mainland. In 2017, the brand launched with an unprecedented 40 shades of foundation and has since added more. Its outsized profitability has dramatically shifted the beauty landscape, with many companies now offering their own more diverse and inclusive range of cosmetics.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/style/china-rihanna-fenty-beauty-promotion-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "style_article_kate-moss-glastonbury-fashion-remember-when", "text": "Remember when Kate Moss wore wellies (that\u2019s rain boots for those outside the UK) to Glastonbury? As the historic festival once again returns to Worthy Farm, we look back at one of its most memorable fashion moments. After all, no British summer would be complete without copious amounts of mud.  And no one has conquered it quite like Moss.   Some 19 years ago, Britain\u2019s best-known supermodel broke fashion\u2019s proverbial fourth wall and joined the mortals in their muddy squalor. Sure, she\u2019d probably spent the weekend glamping in the festival\u2019s VIP zone. But a filthy field is England\u2019s great leveler \u2013 and during those brief, well-photographed walks through the Glastonbury grounds, cigarette in hand, she was just like us. Until, that is, her choice of practical footwear transformed festival fashion and helped save a heritage boot maker from the brink of obsolescence. It was the summer\u00a0of 2005 and Moss was near the height of her powers. Media interest in her festival whereabouts was amplified by a fixation with her then-nascent dalliance with Pete Doherty. But while The Libertines\u2019 frontman certainly looked more at home in the conditions, it was Moss who grabbed the limelight.  Matching a pair of classic black Hunter rain boots with a waistcoat, short shorts and studded belt (and later a glittering tunic), the model was a picture of understated glamor. Below the knee her look was interchangeable with that of a Somerset pig farmer. But above it, she could just have easily emerged from a Chelsea mansion to a well-placed paparazzi ambush. The images quickly went viral (or as viral as they could in the pre-social media age). The bastion of mid-1990s so-called \u201cheroin chic\u201d had become the face of its slightly older, more respectable cousin: mid-2000s festival chic. In the process, wellies secured their place in the popular imagination. No longer the preserve of agriculture, they had become a rubbery status symbol best matched with trilby hats, cravats and other questionable noughties accessories. This once-practical boot had morphed into bourgeois badge of honor indicating that the wearer was prepared to \u201crough it\u201d and still look fabulous (the drug-afflicted rockstar boyfriend remained an optional part of the look). Suddenly, festival wear became its own category of clothing, something far greater than an amalgam of items you didn\u2019t mind ruining. But an even more profound transformation was also taking place \u2013 that of the then-struggling Hunter Boot Limited. The Scottish brand\u2019s true heyday may have been during the World Wars, when it produced huge quantities of waterproof boots for the front lines. But never before in the company\u2019s then 149-year history had its sensible footwear been so desirable. While one shouldn\u2019t overstate the power of the Moss effect (her endorsement couldn\u2019t save the boot maker from entering administration in 2006), it helped set in motion a remarkable turnaround in the company\u2019s fortunes.  By 2007, the firm was under new ownership and reporting an 85% increase in year-on-year sales. It has since become a bona fide festival fixture, producing rainwear, outerwear and boots in all manner of colors and styles. Once prized for keeping gangrene at bay in the trenches, Hunter has completed the ultimate 21st-century transformation to become the rainy-day boot de jour for celebrities from Rita Ora to Rihanna, Cara Delevingne to Alexa Chung. And to think that all Kate wanted was a pair of snug, dry feet.", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/article/kate-moss-glastonbury-fashion-remember-when/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "style_article_liu-heung-shing-coca-cola-snap-mic-intl-hnk", "text": "A young man stands grinning in Beijing\u2019s Forbidden City. It\u2019s the dead of winter, and one of his hands is buried deep into the pockets of his long overcoat to protect it from the chill. The other grasps the unmistakable contours of a glass Coca-Cola bottle. Today, Coke is the world\u2019s most famous soft drink and can be found just about anywhere. But back in 1981, when the image was shot by Pulitzer-Prize winning photographer Liu Heung Shing, it was only just getting into the hands of ordinary Chinese people. Liu, who was in his late 20s when he began working for Time magazine in Beijing, felt the country was on the cusp of a great cultural shift following the death of Mao Zedong in 1976.  \u201cThe changes (at first) were subtle, and unless you lived there, you wouldn\u2019t have noticed,\u201d he recalled during an interview at his home in Hong Kong.  He had earlier photographed people grieving for Mao along the banks of the Pearl River in Guangzhou. It was here that he was struck by how differently people carried themselves compared to what he had seen in late-1950s China, where he grew up during the disastrous Great Leap Forward campaign \u2014 a series of failed industrialization policies \u2014 before moving back to Hong Kong as a child. Under Mao, the country went on to suffer from widespread famine and poverty, and the tumultuous years of the Cultural Revolution. But in the aftermath of the Chinese leader\u2019s death, Liu said, \u201csuddenly, people\u2019s steps looked a little bit lighter, they dropped their shoulders and their faces looked more relaxed.\u201d It would prove to be a relatively liberal period in Chinese history \u2014 politically, economically and in terms of everyday life, which Liu captured in candid shots. One photo from the time showed a plastic surgeon and his client after a cosmetic procedure. Another depicted people gathering at a \u201cDemocracy Wall\u201d in Beijing, where they wrote now-unthinkable criticisms of the government. One of Liu\u2019s most iconic images was captured on his way into the Time bureau after he had the strange feeling that something was \u201cmissing.\u201d He turned his car around and, sure enough, a large portrait of Mao that had once hung prominently on a building had been freshly taken down. He quickly shot images of workers gathered around the depiction of the late Chairman, with some of their scaffolding visible in the frame. This was China \u201cmoving out of the shadow of Mao,\u201d he said. \u2018It tastes so-so\u2019 In December 1978, Coca-Cola became the first foreign enterprise permitted to enter the mainland Chinese market since the communist revolution. That same month, Beijing and Washington announced the normalization of Sino-American relations and Deng Xiaoping kick-started China\u2019s transformative economic reforms with his \u201cOpen Door\u201d policy. (Coca-Cola was first introduced to China in the 1920s but had been forced to leave in 1949, along with other foreign companies, by a government that regarded it as bourgeois). Liu had photographed the opening of a joint-venture bottling plant in Beijing, capturing Coke chairman Roberto Goizueta and Chinese trade officials drinking Coca Cola and holding bottles aloft to cries of \u201cganbei\u201d (cheers). He then thought to himself, \u201cNow where do I find a (regular) Chinese person enjoying this (drink)?\u201d He headed to the Forbidden City, with its heavy flow of tourists, and soon found a man named Zhang Wei purchasing a Coke from a small stand. \u201cI remember he made a comment when he drank this syrupy Coke: \u2018It tastes so-so\u2019\u201d said Liu, who ended up taking a few shots with one of the imperial palace\u2019s picturesque pavilions in the background.  The response to Coke itself may have been underwhelming, but the snap perfectly captured the curiosity and openness many Chinese people felt at the time. \u201cAs a photographer, I of course realized the significance. That this man, dressed in a ubiquitous PLA (People\u2019s Liberation Army) coat, was one of the very first people to taste it,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cBut I didn\u2019t realize it would become part of the Chinese collective memory.\u201d The image would be widely published and displayed in the following years, and he later became friends with Zhang. In 1983, it appeared in Liu\u2019s photography book \u201cChina after Mao,\u201d a collection of images taken between 1976 and 1982. More recently he included it in his book \u201cLiu Heung Shing: A Life in a Sea of Red.\u201d   The photographer would go on to document other periods and profound events in the country\u2019s modern history, including the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. And just like those pictures of young student activists calling for democracy, Liu\u2019s Coca-Cola photograph feels part of another era altogether. With its apparent embrace of the new and the foreign \u2014 ideas encapsulated in that most American of drinks \u2014 the image stands in stark contrast to today\u2019s China, where relations with the US are at an all-time low. Xi Jinping\u2019s nationalist agenda has generated increasingly xenophobic attitudes towards the West.   \u201cI realized that the story I did in the last quarter of the 20th century (would) continue to carry relevance into the 21st century,\u201d Liu said. \u201cEspecially with the story of China, I never doubt that these photographs are in the Chinese people\u2019s collective memory. \u201cEven though this memory keeps being re-edited\u2026 the good thing about a photograph, is you cannot re-edit it. It becomes an image seared in people\u2019s minds.\u201d Top image: A 1981 photograph of a man with a Coke bottle in Beijing\u2019s Forbidden City, shot by Liu Heung Shing.

The 1989 \u201cStudy for Portrait of Jos\u00e9 Capelo\u201d is the fourth painting to be recovered of the group, which is estimated to be worth a combined \u20ac25 million. In February, police arrested two people accused of the receipt of stolen artworks in the Spanish capital, leading them to ultimately discover the painting at a property in Madrid. Since the investigation began, 16 people believed to have masterminded and carried out the robbery have been arrested, police said in a statement. Three of the paintings were\u00a0recovered in 2017. Police said they continue to investigate Spanish citizens with links to organized groups from Eastern Europe in the hope it will lead them to the fifth painting. According to local media, the paintings were stolen from the apartment of Jos\u00e9 Capelo, Bacon\u2019s friend and former lover, although police would not confirm or deny that information. Dublin-born Bacon, who died in Madrid in 1992, was one of the most acclaimed artists of the 20th century, known for his disturbing vision of the human body.

Roberts, an actor who has become a mainstay of rom coms and campy horror \u2014 the latter, most recently with recurring roles in the anthology series \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d \u2014 bought the home, which she shares with her three-year-old son Rhodes, in 2022 and hired the design firm Pierce & Ward to overhaul its interiors. In the May issue of Architectural Digest, she reveals the results of that makeover. For Roberts, having a space that feels like home is a particular priority, she explained, as she moved often as a child. So when she saw the property listed as a rental on Instagram (it has been reported as a former residence of Minnie Driver), she inquired if she could purchase it instead. \u201cI think I lived in 10 houses by the time I was 15 \u2014 so for me now, having a son, I wanted a place that felt really ours.\u201d she told AD. \u201cI have a picture of the day we moved in\u2026 I just remember feeling like we are exactly where we need to be.\u201d The designers, Louisa Pierce and Emily Ward, with whom Roberts had previously worked, are known for down-to-earth spaces that mix bohemian, mid-century modern and rustic styles. Their clients have included Roberts\u2019 \u201cMadame Web\u201d co-star Dakota Johnson as well as Kate Hudson and Leonardo DiCaprio. \u201cWe want a house to look like it\u2019s been there for 50 years,\u201d Pierce told AD in the cover story. \u201cWe never want a home to look new.\u201d In that spirit, much of Roberts\u2019 furniture, art and decor is repurposed or reupholstered. In the living room, beneath a disco ball-like globe light, paperbacks are enclosed in living room cabinets while rarer books are openly displayed. Framed photographs of Debbie Harry and Joni Mitchell rest on wooden cabinets; elsewhere, one of Roberts\u2019 most treasured artworks \u2014 a Julian Wasser portrait of Joan Didion in front of a Corvette \u2014 hangs on the wall. Though many pieces are courtesy of design studios or antique finds, Pierce and Ward don\u2019t look down on more accessible commercial brands. Roberts recalled when she asked if her new kitchen island was custom-made, they laughed and said it was from Urban Outfitters. As for a room for Rhodes, who is starting his own book collection, Roberts opted for a soothing wallpaper scene of flying ducks on the ceiling, above a lush forest-themed upholstered bed. \u201cI remember as a kid, whatever\u2019s on your wall and your ceiling is seared into your brain for the rest of your life,\u201d Roberts explained. \u201cSo I wanted to make it extra cozy and fun, but not too overwhelming.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/16/style/emma-roberts-la-home-architectural-digest/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "style_article_reuben-wu-landscape-photography", "text": "The first time Reuben Wu saw the warm sandstone hues and vast, open skies of the American West, he was watching the landscapes pass him by from the window of a tour bus.  The British visual artist, now based in Chicago, has become known for his sublime imagery of remote landscapes using drone lighting, enhancing craggy peaks with halos, or writing glyphs in the sky like signals from a supernatural entity. But for a long time, art was just a passion project while he focused on a music career as one of the four members of the synth-pop band Ladytron. \u201c(Photography) started as an all-consuming hobby,\u201d he explained in a phone interview. But when Ladytron took a break in 2011 after five studio albums (they released a self-titled sixth album in 2019, and the seventh, \u201cTime\u2019s Arrow,\u201d this month), he began a new career from scratch. \u201cWhile the others did their own solo projects, making their own music and releasing their own albums, this was my solo project.\u201d Wu\u2019s imagery takes a classic photographer\u2019s combination \u2014 light and landscape \u2014 and marries the two in transformative ways. He often begins with dusky evening light or the ink-black shadows of night, then strategically illuminates portions of the scene with custom-built consumer drones. In one image, a bright horizontal line hangs over a glacier in the Peruvian Andes, revealing the brilliance of the ice against a dark sky. In a different motion piece, Wu simulated an electrical storm in Goblin Valley, Utah, but with perfectly straight strikes of light rather than the jagged bursts of lightning.  The artist\u2019s 2018 photo book \u201cLux Noctis\u201d is in the collections of the Guggenheim and Museum of Modern Art, in New York, and he has shot commercial work for Apple, Audi and Google as well as the DJ and music producer Zedd. Last summer, Wu revealed a colossal project for National Geographic: a cover story and timelapse multimedia piece about Stonehenge, which featured the enigmatic monument lit by his custom drones. In November, one of his NFTs, a 4K video loop titled \u201cAn Irresistible Force,\u201d outperformed its high estimate by over 25% during an auction at Sotheby\u2019s Hong Kong, selling at 441,000 HKD (about $56,500). \u201cI couldn\u2019t have dreamed of where I am now,\u201d Wu said. \u201cI just wanted to be able to make a living from doing art and from doing photography.\u201d  Alien inspiration Wu has always been drawn to wild, remote places where he could find solitude. His parents immigrated from Hong Kong to the UK before he was born, and he grew up an introverted child in Liverpool, he said, who didn\u2019t quite click with school. He was fascinated with science-fiction films that mix the alien with the everyday, such as Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind,\u201d which featured Wyoming\u2019s Devils Tower as a site for extraterrestrial contact. (Unfamiliar with American topography, he initially thought the butte, a national monument, was a fictional geological entity, he explained with a laugh).  The film\u2019s visuals of remote desert scenes mixed with eerie lights have been a formative inspiration in his own work. \u201c(It\u2019s) cemented into my brain, the idea of these seemingly impossible lights moving through the sky, kind of like search lights on very ordinary (American) landscapes,\u201d he said.  He embarked on his first cross-country photography trip across the US in 2013, around a decade after getting a taste on the road with Ladytron. The resulting series featured vivid depictions of the Grand Canyon and South Dakota Badlands, as well as a time-lapse image of Devils Tower at night among star trails.  Two years later, Wu discovered the effect that drone lighting could have on the natural world while working on an outdoor automotive shoot. \u201cI flew the drone up above some cliffs, and I was absolutely fascinated by the effect it had on the actual landscape,\u201d he explained. It made the cliffs glow, reaching areas that were otherwise impossible to light artificially.  Wu rigs lights on drones to suit his needs on any given shoot or project. The first iteration, he said, which he used when the technology was still nascent, was a \u201cmassive\u201d eight-rotor drone outfitted with homemade lights that only had about eight minutes of flight time. The next used a 3D-printed bracket with an LED hot light, but still only gave him an additional two minutes in the air. The tech he uses now gives him a bit more breathing room, with a half hour to fly out, capture images and return to him, but he\u2019s had to learn to work within the bounds of each set-up. \u201cI\u2019m a lot less anxious now, because I\u2019ve crashed a number of drones,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in the end, they\u2019re just tools.\u201d  Experimental series After developing series of still images such as \u201cLux Noctis\u201d and \u201cAeroglyphs,\u201d which experiment with ghostly lighting and geometric shapes in the skies, Wu found himself wanting to incorporate motion and sound into his work because of his own background in music. He began creating 15-second video loops from his images, showing light beams forming patterns or the moon arcing across the sky, to the beats of atmospheric electronic music that he produced. \u201cThese (works) were very much experimental and had no end goal \u2014 they were just things that I did for love out of love,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t license them, I couldn\u2019t print them\u2026 and so they were just there, stacking likes on my Instagram.\u201d But in January 2021, Wu found a way to make them a more substantial part of his career when he was introduced to NFT art. He minted his first \u201cnon-fungible token\u201d  on the marketplace Foundation two months later \u2014 an \u201caeroglyph\u201d of bright lines forming a rectangle above a beachside cliff. It sold for 30 ETH ($45,000), a portion of which he donated to the National Parks Conservation Association and the AAPI Community Fund. Later that year, the web3 arts organization Obscura commissioned him to produce a new set of images titled \u201cAeroglyph Variations,\u201d which took him into the New Mexico badlands for a 20-hour shoot that resulted in 55 images of the same setting, each with different lighting conditions and patterns. Wu has also experimented with presenting the work in different ways, from animations, to AR experiences, to projection mapping moving images onto physical prints. \u201cIt\u2019s very much a hybrid medium, and so I\u2019d like to expand that horizon even more, and think about the end goal for my work,\u201d he said. \u201cAm I creating a nice piece of art for people to look at and appreciate, or am I creating an experience for people to share?\u201d Wu is leaning towards the latter as he continues to experiment with the form his work takes, but no matter the medium, his vision of and approach to the natural world remains consistent. \u201cA lot of people always say that my work is otherworldly \u2014 that is the first word that people think of when they think about my work,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not trying to create an alien-looking image; I\u2019m trying to show that this is our planet. And there are so many new ways that are available to see it that can renew your perspective.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/article/reuben-wu-landscape-photography/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_style_hot-rodent-men-celebrities", "text": "In the Chinese zodiac, 2024 is the year of the dragon. To the internet, it is the year of the rat. It began, seemingly, with a few innocuous social media posts comparing Mike Faist, co-star of the titillating tennis throuple film \u201cChallengers,\u201d to a dormouse. Soon, the complexity of the analogy snowballed to odd levels of specificity: He\u2019s a field mouse. No, he\u2019s a cartoon mouse. No, he\u2019s Despereaux (the dumbo-eared mouse from the 2008 animated film \u201cThe Tale of Despereaux\u201d). No, he\u2019s Stuart Little, if Stuart Little was hot. He was \u201clike if a sleepy cartoon mouse came to life and then got really into cross fit,\u201d wrote journalist Lucy Ford on X. And it wasn\u2019t long until fans on social media began examining the facial features of other male celebrities for similar signs of rodent likeness \u2014 Faist\u2019s \u201cChallengers\u201d co-star Josh O\u2019Connor, for example. Barry Keoghan. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. Jeremy Allen White. Glen Powell. This list goes on. From chinchillas to capybaras,\u00a0the rodent comparisons sped across social media like a runaway wheel of cheese, warping the image (and perhaps the confidence) of many popular, young white male celebrities in its path. On June 2, a Daily Mail article introduced this internet in-joke to the masses. \u201cHow \u2018hot rodent\u2019 men became Hollywood\u2019s sexiest heartthrobs: Gen Z fans are going wild for actors with unusual features including Barry Keoghan, Kieran Culkin and Jeremy Allen White,\u201d read the headline. The trend has since been covered by the New York Times, the Guardian, the London Times, NBC and the Today Show, among others. How do these men \u2014 heartthrobs of the moment, even \u2014 feel about being categorized as \u201chot rodents\u201d? Powell, who was first likened to a rodent back in 2023, has gamely praised the ingenuity of the chronically online. \u201cThis is why the internet\u2019s a great place,\u201d he told Jimmy Fallon last December. \u201cI really kind of own the capybara thing now. I am the capybara.\u201d Despite outreach, CNN did not receive a response from O\u2019Connor, Chalamet, Keoghan or White. (Faist\u2019s agent, meanwhile, confirmed that the actor does not use social media. A small mercy). But more broadly, the informal sampling of average Joes \u2014 or should that be average Jerrys? \u2014 CNN reached for comment largely didn\u2019t mind being dubbed ratty. Surveyed in a Whatsapp friend group, one 20-something admitted hearing the term would \u201churt,\u201d while another said he would be happy to embrace \u201chot rat summer.\u201d A third man polled shared\u00a0that despite an initial knee jerk reaction, he understood that \u201crodent men are very hot right now\u201d and so would probably be \u201cflattered.\u201d For some, the question goes beyond the hypothetical. One had already been called a \u201crat boy\u201d by his current girlfriend. \u201cShe\u2019s still with me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSo I\u2019ve taken it well.\u201d Similarly, Gustav, a 22-year-old X user, has also been compared to a mouse. (Stuart Little, to be precise \u2014 just like Faist.) \u201cI\u2019d say I mostly found the comment amusing,\u201d he told CNN via X. \u201cIt was clearly not meant as an insult and even though some people would take it as an insult, I mostly felt it was a way of saying that I was cute.\u201d While by no means exhaustive, these responses suggest men feel mostly fine with the \u201chot rodent\u201d trend. But if any male celebrity is struggling with the break-neck transition from traditional dreamboat to furry pin-up, perhaps the Chinese zodiac \u2014 which believes rats to be among the most intelligent, popular and charming animals of the 12-year cycle \u2014 can be some comfort, after all.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/style/hot-rodent-men-celebrities/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_style_highlights-menswear-shows-paris-fashion-week", "text": "Paris may be readying itself for the Summer Olympics, but sporting events are not the only buzzy affairs taking place in the French capital. This past week, fashion designers converged in the city for Paris Fashion Week Spring-Summer 2025 menswear collections \u2014 but nothing was business as usual. Both the menswear shows and the couture shows (now in full swing) were moved up a week to avoid interfering with sport\u2019s most celebrated event, and simmering political tensions ahead of the country\u2019s surprise snap election, called by President Emmanuel Macron, have filled the streets with near daily protests in the past few weeks. In this climate, there was no shortage of political commentary on the menswear runways, but perhaps the loudest by the American designers showing in the city. At Rick Owens\u2019 grandiose show at the Palais de Tokyo, which featured a near-all white collection mixing biblical references and Art Deco, he sent out a diverse cast of models whom he called his \u201cWhite Satin Army of Love\u201d and urged solidarity with one another. \u201cExpressing our individuality is great but sometimes expressing our unity and reliance on each other is a good thing to remember too\u2026 especially in the face of the peak intolerance we are experiencing in the world right now,\u201d he wrote in the show notes. Rapper A$AP Rocky, too, made a statement for his Paris Fashion Week debut \u2014 a secret show for his label AWGE, which launched earlier this year. Calling the presentation \u201cAmerican Sabotage,\u201d it was hosted in Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s former home, the 18th-century mansion H\u00f4tel de Maisons, and attended, of course, by\u00a0Rihanna, as well as Pusha T, Casey Affleck, and designers Jonathan Anderson and Willy Chavarria. Guests were greeted with invitations bearing an antiwar sign and cakes resembling guns and cocaine bags, for an air of dystopia. On the runway, models marched with their heads covered by American eagle flags, wore slogans like \u201cDon\u2019t be Dumb\u201d and carried plastic bags filled with cash. In the show notes, the rapper declared that his label is \u201cmore than just a brand\u2014it\u2019s a movement.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re wrecking boundaries and making statements through every piece, reflecting the spirit and resilience of our communities. This is fashion with purpose, where art meets activism,\u201d he explained. For his fourth showing with Louis Vuitton, Pharrell also played up military symbols, combining camouflage and damier \u2014 the luxury house\u2019s signature checkerboard \u2014 into \u201cdamoflage.\u201d The show, hosted at UNESCO headquarters, featured cartography graphics and military berets, and pointed to travel, aviation, international diplomacy and a creative dialogue \u2014 notably through collaborating with the creative collective Air Afrique on graphics. And then there was KidSuper, another majestic show with giant marionette hands to which the models staggered out like puppets. Designer Colm Dillane wanted to \u201cexplore interconnectedness and the unseen forces shaping our world,\u201d he wrote in show notes, inviting the audience to \u201creflect on autonomy\u201d and the narratives we each construct for ourselves. Subcultures as craft Elsewhere on the runways, designers brought subculture styles to the fore. German magazine 032C showed something akin to techno couture, which bridged a party-to-office lifestyle. Minimalist and functional, clothes spanned neon orange workwear to faux vintage sportswear to chokers and XXL cargo pants, all reminiscent of Berlin\u2019s legendary nightlife style. Junya Watanabe, meanwhile, presented a mix of tartan and heavy metal with reworked ACDC, Skorpions and Black Sabbath t-shirts onto a tailored wardrobe; and Doublet mixed club-kid aesthetics with suiting and graffitied tops. Models carried gold and silver pom poms \u2014 some as props, others as clutches \u2014 adding an unexpected accessory to both casual and more formal looks. And of course there was queer fashion label Jeanne Friot, with feather-adorned denim pants and belt bandeau skirts for all genders, entirely crafted out of deadstock. The designer wants to offer a wider range of expressions for men. \u201cFor me, punk today means\u2026 doing things locally, responsibly\u2026 just as much as addressing gender norms,\u201d Friot explained in an interview following the show. Pretty boys Across the menswear shows, other designers joined Friot in redefining what menswear looks like. Storied luxury house Comme des Gar\u00e7ons played with bright fuchsia tailoring and skirt pants, blending former gender distinctions. The layered maximalist collection featured ruffles, giant lapels and tulle, evoking the elaborate and delicate court attire of France\u2019s former monarchy rather than functional fashion. Japanese brand Sacai, meanwhile,\u00a0brought experimental couture to everyday clothes with a collection that focused on the joy and freedom of discovery, offering up\u00a0skirts-shorts, layered suits and giant bouffant sleeves.\u00a0The label Taakk also offered romantic lines, sheer shirts, floral motifs and a sense of delicacy, with candy-coloured silk and satin, as well as coiled pin curls worn by models. Last but not least, Etudes Studio centered its work on what artists might need, quoting Andy Warhol and notably Jean-Michel Basquiat as an inspiration for his \u201claid-back, nonchalant\u201d sense of elegance, as the trio of designers \u2014 J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Egry, Aur\u00e9lien Arnet and Jos\u00e9 Lamali \u2014 described backstage.

Shown on a runway made of silver foil, the shimmery, delicate pieces were not a \u201cbest-of\u201d or a retrospective, but a final collection that will no doubt sell. The show received a standing ovation as\u00a0Donna Summer\u2019s \u201cI Feel Love\u201d set the ebullient mood.

Composed of more than 50 items, the collection featured several of Diana\u2019s evening gowns, suits, shoes, hats and handbags, as well as personal letters and photographs. Memorabilia that belonged to other members of the British royal family, such as Queen Victoria, Princess Margaret and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, also formed part of the auction, which closed Thursday. A magenta silk and lace evening gown, featuring an off-the-shoulder bodice and tiered skirt, worn by Diana twice in 1987, proved the most expensive lot of the night, selling for $910,000, more than four times its estimate of $200,000. Its designer, Victor Edelstein, also created the famous off-the-shoulder, midnight blue velvet evening gown Diana wore while dancing with John Travolta at the White House.

Instead of your Cinderellas, Elsas and Annas in their royal best, it\u2019s a fuzzy pink fox that\u2019s inspiring the princess-esque outfits of Disney-goers in their teens and 20s. LinaBell is the latest addition to a line of plush toys called \u201cDuffy and Friends,\u201d created by Disney for the Asian market. She has never made it onto the big screen, but she and her furry companions have resonated with fans in the region, becoming one of the company\u2019s best-selling franchises in the city\u2019s theme park. Young women in particular are drawing inspiration from the pastel-colored characters, creating coquettish looks. \u201cLinaBell is my favorite,\u201d said Liang Xiaoyu who was visiting from the Chinese city of Guangzhou. The 18-year-old was dressed in a pink-trimmed white frock, her hair in two loose ponytails, and was carrying a LinaBell backpack and keychain. Others spotted during a rainy June day channeled CookieAnn (a yellow dog who loves to bake), by wearing dog-ear headbands as well as ShellieMay and Duffy, the line\u2019s two bears. Dressing up is popular at Disney theme parks across the world \u2014 not just for kids, but for adults as well. Known as \u201cDisneybounding,\u201d the phenomenon sees visitors circumvent rules on wearing full Disney costumes (some masks, for instance, are banned\u00a0to avoid any confusion with the parks\u2019 own costumed employees) by using clothing and accessories that evoke their favorite characters. Qin Wuxiao, dressed from head to toe as Jessie the cowgirl doll from the \u201cToy Story\u201d franchise, was taking photos with her mother in front of the Castle of Magical Dreams. The 23-year-old student said it\u2019s become popular for young people to dress up like characters and post pictures of themselves on Chinese social media apps like Xiaohongshu. Charmy Chan and her friend Yanni Chung dressed for the day as Officer Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde from \u201cZootopia.\u201d The Hong Kong Baptist University students grew up watching Disney movies and now that they\u2019re in college they find themselves with more time to visit. \u201cWe usually come to the park once a month,\u201d said Chan, in front of the park\u2019s bakery on Main Street USA.  And at Hong Kong Disneyland, Disney characters aren\u2019t the sole fashion inspiration for dedicated fans. All around the park, there were guests like 27-year-old Li Mengru from China\u2019s Fujian province and 16-year-old Chen Xinyu from Guangdong province, dressed as Lolitas.  Not a Nabokovian Lolita, but women who dress in an unabashedly feminine style of clothing popularized in Japan in the mid-1990s. Think petticoats, dainty shoes and accessories. Li wore a light baby blue dress with statement bows and elaborate crystal nails, while Chen went with a more gothic look. Linda Lee, meanwhile, wore a bold striped black and white dress adorned with cherries and red ribbons. In the age of Instagram and TikTok, the park lends a perfect background for Disneybounders and cosplayers to immerse themselves in a fantasy world. There\u2019s the World of Frozen that opened in November last year, where influencers can be found taking photos in front of a snowflake fountain on the streets of Arendelle. Tomorrowland lends itself as a futuristic backdrop for Marvel and \u201cStar Wars\u201d fans while Toy Story Land with its outsize wooden blocks, green army men and race cars make for some playful shots. A sweet escape Since the pandemic, the city \u2013 which imposed some of the world\u2019s strictest travel restrictions \u2013 has been looking to boost tourism numbers by launching a \u201cHello Hong Kong\u201d campaign, that included giving away free flights. Though most visitors to the park are local residents, the majority government-owned Hong Kong Disneyland Resort is one of the key attractions being promoted to tourists. The Hong Kong Tourism Board\u2019s exit survey of around 93,000 people in 2023 showed the park was the third most visited attraction in the city. The shopping district of Tsim Sha Tsui and scenic spot The Peak were the two top spots respectively. Many of the non-local visitors to Hong Kong Disneyland live in mainland China or countries in Southeast Asia like the Philippines, Thailand and Singapore, with some coming from Japan and South Korea as well. Wandering into Adventureland from Grizzly Gulch, 34-year-old Kris Yang and 35-year-old Jimmy Redinger stopped to chat with CNN.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s crazy about Disney,\u201d said Yang who is from mainland China of his partner, who is from the United States. The two primary school teachers were visiting from the northern Chinese province of Hebei. They wore shirts from \u201cZootopia\u201d and \u201cHercules\u201d and were decked out in Disney paraphernalia. \u201cIf you like my outfit today, you should have seen me yesterday,\u201d said Redinger who proudly identified himself as a \u201cDisney adult,\u201d a term that might come with some baggage in the United States, given some of the extremes fans have gone viral for. \u201cI was in a full Goofy movie get-up.\u201d \u201cI embrace the idea of a \u2018Disney adult\u2019,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s in the name. Adults who love Disney. Someone who really has that connection to the company and parks.\u201d In Asia, the penchant for child-like things as adults broadly carries less social stigma than in the West. China\u2019s \u201cmeng\u201d and Japan\u2019s \u201ckawaii\u201d cultures embrace cuteness. Many, like 37-year-old Mariko Otomo kitted out in Disney accessories, were there as a form of escape. \u201cUsually we work very hard. We go office and back, office and back,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we finally come to Disney we forget the daily stuff.\u201d \u201cEven just walking here, (I) have a good feeling,\u201d said Ankh Wong a 24-year-old saleswoman who has visited the park more than 20 times over the past six years. As soon as she got her first job, she bought a ticket to the park. \u201cIt\u2019s a place for happiness and I can put down my worries,\u201d said 16-year-old Deng Chundan. Tactics like themed staycations and special events, collaborations with brands like Le Creuset, Godiva and local jeweler Chow Tai Fook and cultivating successful franchises such as Duffy and Friends are part of the park\u2019s strategy to appeal to Gen Z and millennials. In recent years, the park has invested a reported $1.4 billion in expanding some of its attractions, which included a new \u201cFrozen\u201d themed section of the park. (\u201cFrozen,\u201d which came out in 2013, is likely one of the first Disney films Gen Z would have watched as children). Disney declined CNN\u2019s request for information on the ages of its annual visitors, but it\u2019s clear the Hong Kong park draws many grown-up fans. Redinger said nostalgia brings him back time and time again. \u201cAs the parks grow, we grow with the parks, reliving that time with our families (that) we had.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/style/hong-kong-disneyland-dress-up-disneybound-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_style_thom-browne-couture-show-2024", "text": "True to his theatrical form, Thom Browne\u2019s fall 2024 couture show opened with spectacle. Men grasping a rope battled for supremacy in a staged game of tug of war at the hallowed \u201cMus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs\u201d gallery in Paris, where the American designer riffed off the upcoming Olympic Games to tell a story about sports, old-world couture and camp. Quoting both antiquity and American myths, models replicated stereotypical poses of athletes throughout time \u2014 from archers and disc throwers to weightlifters \u2014 playfully deconstructing both gender roles and classical tailoring. The latter molded bodies into exaggerated shoulder lines and tiny waists reminiscent of vintage sport iconography. Tennis skirts and dramatic heel-less track boots, complete with laurel wreath headdresses paved the way for playful homages to France: dresses adorned with hand-painted blue swimming briefs or red bikinis (the two-piece was invented in France in 1946) and beaded \u2018tricolore\u2019 lapels on jackets and overcoats. Browne launched his label in 2001 in New York\u2019s West Village, first operating by appointment only, and has since won the CFDA Menswear Designer Award in 2006, 2012, and again in 2016. His collections have been coveted by celebrities, collectors and museums. Thom Browne (which has, since 2018, been part of Zegna group who own a 90% stake) is also a ready-to-wear business currently offered in over 300 department-stores and boutiques across 40 countries, as well as in 110 Thom Browne retail stores.\u00a0\u201cI have a very successful commercial side of my business,\u201d Browne explained in an interview with CNN backstage. \u201c(Couture) balances the other side of what I do.\u201d As is the way with Browne, the show was an entertaining and playful vehicle to exhibit traditional couture techniques. \u201cI like to tell a story,\u201d he explained. \u201cI like to entertain and to ground it in beautifully made clothes.\u201d Perhaps surprisingly for a couture collection, it was muslin \u2014 the simple, lightweight cotton used to create initial mock-ups of clothes (called \u201ctoiles\u201d) at ateliers \u2014 that comprised much of Browne\u2019s finished pieces. To quote the show-notes: \u201cThe toile as the source text\u2026 The toile as the finale garment\u2026 The work-in-progress becomes the final work\u2026 Couture.\u201d Using exposed stitching as well as ancient techniques including hand-basting (an intricate and ancient method used by artisans when working with delicate fabric or to create precise alignments), the designer\u2019s aim, he said, was to play with tailoring and proportions. Jared Ellner, a celebrity stylist who dressed influencer Emma Chamberlain and actor Molly Gordon for the show and regularly works with singer Sabrina Carpenter said of Thom Browne: \u201cIt\u2019s so easily and instantly recognizable, yet pushes barriers aesthetically\u2026 Never making everyone look the same but allowing each person to add their own style to it\u2026\u00a0(Sabrina and Emma) like to dress up like a character\u2026\u00a0really pushing their own individuality.\u201d And at a time when most discreet details are lost on camera, perhaps that could be the ultimate luxury.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/style/thom-browne-couture-show-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "style_yushi-li-the-smothering-dream-snap", "text": " A group of men lie at the foot of a sofa, their naked bodies peeking out through a carpet of rose petals. Some look toward the photograph\u2019s protagonist, an Asian woman in a lime green dress laying across the cushioned loveseat. Others gaze away, seemingly indifferent, as if caught in some sort of hazy spell. Despite Chinese photographer Yushi Li\u2019s gentle staging, her title for the photograph, \u201cThe Smothering Dream,\u201d suggests something more sinister is at play. Referencing Dutch painter Lawrence Alma-Tadema\u2019s 1888 work \u201cThe Roses of Heliogabalus,\u201d in which a Roman emperor watches on as unsuspecting banquet guests slowly suffocate in flowers, Li\u2019s modern take \u2014 shot on a set awash with pastel colors and delicate furniture \u2014 is equally deceptive at first glance. Li, is not only the photographer, but also the muse at the center of the image. \u201cI made this very pink and kitsch dream,\u201d she said, describing the London living room set in a phone interview. \u201cBut underneath it, there is, like, some kind of violence. It\u2019s a fantasy of love and eroticism\u2026 smothering these men I desire.\u201d Shot in 2022, \u201cThe Smothering Dream\u201d was recently on show at Photofairs Shanghai as part of a group exhibition called \u201cA Quiet Gaze.\u201d It was a fitting title to showcase the work of an artist for whom an examination of the male and female gazes has been a recurring theme. Li\u2019s wider portfolio of subversive images include softly-lit nude portraits of strangers she scouted through a dating app (a series titled \u201cMy Tinder Boys\u201d). Stripped of their clothes and therefore their character, she said, the men lounge around their homes doing banal tasks: one scoops out of a fresh watermelon, while another casually balances a plate of spaghetti over his private parts. The series is partly a response to erotic images objectifying women that are historically ubiquitous in art, advertisements and photography. Although a canon of male nudes does exist, it largely comprises images shot by gay male photographers. When Li began the series in 2017, she noticed a lack of images depicting naked men as objects of desire from a woman\u2019s perspective. After some mistook her work as being shot by a male photographer, she began inserting herself into the photos \u2014 fully clothed alongside naked counterparts, and often the only person looking directly at the camera. \u201cInstead of being a passive, \u2018looked-at\u2019 thing, I want to be the one who is in control, who is creating the story, who is expressing my fantasy,\u201d said Li. Her images have also pushed back against the longstanding fetishization of Asian women, often by Western men, something Li said she has experienced first-hand: \u201cI\u2019m a small person, and come across as quiet, so I kind of fit the stereotype.\u201d Li, who was born in China\u2019s Hunan province and now lives in the UK. She said she feels flattered when women reach out to her online to say they feel empowered by her photographs. \u201cAs a woman, especially as an Asian or Chinese woman, you (should be able to) feel that you can also express your erotic desire.\u201d Who\u2019s in power? Li has been fascinated with how the idea of the gaze has, today, become \u201cless binary.\u201d She has also been examining and playing with the way classical paintings depict power dynamics, portrayals of desire and representations of the body. She brings these ideas into \u201cPaintings, Dreams and Love,\u201d an ongoing project to which \u201cThe Smothering Dream\u201d belongs. (A second photo from the same shoot, entitled \u201cAfter the Dream,\u201d hints at what has just taken place, with satin cushions and wilted petals strewn about the scene). Other sources of inspiration include Swiss painter Henry Fuseli\u2019s 1781 \u201cThe Nightmare,\u201d showing an incubus crouching menacingly atop a sleeping woman, and \u201cThe Death of Actaeon,\u201d Renaissance painter Titian\u2019s 16th-century oil painting of the Romans\u2019 goddess of the hunt, Diana, transforming the Theban hero into a stag that is then killed by his own hounds. In Li\u2019s reinterpretations, she is in full control. In the former, she wears a tight, red turtleneck as she casually sits on an unsuspecting male figure, thwarting the idea of seduction. In the latter, she strikes a calm, calculated pose, pointing a bow and arrow at a naked man in a window. But control, Li says, is subjective in images where multiple gazes can co-exist. \u201cSome of these men (in the photographs) also look at me, and the viewer also looks at all of us,\u201d she said. The internet age, she added, has only further complicated matters. \u201cNow you can look at so many things like instantly, everywhere, or wherever, whenever you want\u2026 it\u2019s something very different, it\u2019s not (just) a physical thing, it\u2019s a digital thing. \u201cThere\u2019s also the gaze from the algorithm, and the gaze from the screen that reflects yourself when you look at it\u2026 the internet (means) we\u2019re subjected to the gaze more, in a way.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/yushi-li-the-smothering-dream-snap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_style_how-britains-political-parties-got-their-colors", "text": "With the UK\u2019s general election just days away, British voters have seen their TV screens, mailboxes and newsfeeds fill with color. Just like commercial brands, political parties know that using a single, bold shade can make them easier to recognize \u2014 whether that\u2019s out on the campaign trail or checking the latest polls. On July 4, the blue of the ruling Conservatives will go head-to-head with the red of Labour. While these are the only two parties with a realistic chance of winning the election, other smaller parties across the British political system offer a veritable kaleidoscope of differing \u2014 and sometimes duplicate \u2014 colours. The Liberal Democrats (orange), and Reform UK (turquoise) and the Green Party (you guessed it), are all vying for votes. The Scottish National Party uses yellow, while Northern Ireland\u2019s Sinn F\u00e9in and Wales\u2019 Plaid Cymru are represented by nearly identical shades of green. Although the older, established parties trace these associations back to their foundation, the importance of color in campaigning blossomed with the advent of new technology and advertising between the 1950s and 1970s, explained Dominic Wring, a professor of political communication at the UK\u2019s Loughborough University. \u201cThe advertising industry itself underwent a change around the introduction of color television, so, increasingly, colors and more ambitious or innovative designs became quite significant,\u201d he said in a phone interview, adding that, during this time, \u201cparties began to simplify their messaging.\u201d Beyond simple brand recognition, certain colors have long been associated with various values and ideologies. Yellow, for instance, is often linked to liberalism, while black has traditionally represented anarchism or fascism \u2014 especially in Britain, where followers of the British Union of Fascists in the 1920s and 1930s were known as \u201cBlackshirts.\u201d For the Labour Party, the use of red was a natural choice for a group allied with trade unions, social democrats and democratic socialists. Since the French Revolution, the color has been widely associated with left-wing politics, symbolizing the blood of workers who died in the struggle against their oppressors. Upon Labour\u2019s inception at the beginning of the 20th century, the party used a red flag as its official logo. \u201cThe color is central and symbolic to the labor movement, and has been since that period,\u201d said Wring, noting that the party logo has since changed to a red rose. The Conservative Party, meanwhile, has historically adopted all the colors of the United Kingdom\u2019s flag \u2014 red white and blue \u2014 in order, perhaps, to promote itself as a defender of British values. Of those three colors, an ultramarine blue emerged as its predominant shade (though the party\u2019s current tree logo is a paler shade than some of its predecessors). Traditionally the most expensive color to produce, blue has long held connotations of wealth and conservatism. Among the smaller parties, color choices have sometimes been relatively straightforward \u2013 the Green Party uses green, unsurprisingly, due to its obvious connections with environmentalism. Others have been more pragmatic. Take the Liberal Democrats\u2019 orange, for instance, which emerged from the combination of the two parties it was created from: the Liberal Party (yellow) and the Social Democratic Party (then associated with the red of Labour, which it broke away from in the early 1980s). Yet for the Liberal Democrats \u2014 the UK\u2019s third largest party until the 2019 election \u2014 the color orange had another benefit: it was otherwise unclaimed. With the Scottish National Party growing in prominence in the 1970s, switching from a clashing yellow made it easier for the Lib Dems to differentiate themselves. Indeed, for recent newcomers \u2014 like the short-lived Referendum Party in the 1990s (pink), or the UK Independence Party (purple) \u2014 distinct colors may simply help them stand out in a crowded political marketplace. And while some colors have historical links, none are indelibly tied to ideologies. Elsewhere in Europe, orange is associated with both the Christian Democrats and, in the east, post-Soviet uprisings (see Ukraine\u2019s so-called \u201cOrange Revolution\u201d). In other countries, green may represent Islamic parties rather than environmental ones. And while brown has longstanding links to Nazi groups, it also features prominently in the logo of the Marijuana Party of Canada. Even the simple idea that blue and red represent right and left-wing parties, respectively, is inconsistent. In the US, Democrats are blue while the more conservative Republicans are red (though before the 1988 presidential election, TV networks often did the opposite, and the current notion of \u201cred states\u201d and \u201cblue states\u201d did not come into common parlance until the 2000 presidential run-off). Of course the irony, in both the US and Britain, is that despite the color-coded campaigning, when people get to the polling booths on voting day, the various shades won\u2019t be displayed for their final, crucial decision \u2014 that\u2019s because the ballot papers are printed in black and white.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/style/how-britains-political-parties-got-their-colors/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}

{"id": "style_worlds-largest-3d-printer-homes-maine-hnk-spc-intl", "text": "Dozens of 3D-printed homes have been built across the world \u2013 to house a family in the US state of Virginia or members of an impoverished community in rural Mexico. The world\u2019s largest 3D-printed neighborhood is currently under construction outside of Austin, Texas. The technology could be especially handy in a place like the US state of Maine, where approximately 80,000 new homes will be needed by 2030 to address a shortage, according to a report released last year by three state agencies. \u201cPeople can\u2019t find homes, they\u2019re very expensive. We also have an aging population \u2026 so there\u2019s less and less people who are electricians, plumbers, or builders,\u201d Habib Dagher, the executive director of the University of Maine\u2019s Advanced Structures and Composites Center (ASCC), told CNN via video call. He says he\u2019s got a solution. Last month, the ASCC unveiled what it says is the world\u2019s largest polymer 3D printer. Dagher hopes the-so-called \u201cFactory of the Future 1.0\u201d can help address the state\u2019s housing crisis \u2013 and revolutionize 3D-home-printing in the process. \u201cThe approach we\u2019ve taken is quite different from what you\u2019ve seen, and you\u2019ve been reading about for years,\u201d he says. A home every 48 hours In recent years, 3D-printing has been used to build everything from businesses to bridges to mosques. One non-profit is even working on printing schools in a war zone. Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, holds the Guinness World Record for the world\u2019s biggest 3D-printed structure and aims to have 25% of new buildings constructed with 3D printing technology by 2030. A great majority of current printing relies on concrete, with a robotic arm equipped with a nozzle layering wet concrete into the right shape. ASCC is flipping the script. Its giant printer, and its predecessor, which in 2019 was certified by Guinness World Records as the \u201clargest prototype polymer 3D printer,\u201d are the only printers building homes with wood residuals, says Dagher. The technology has already been tested. In late 2022, the university unveiled the \u201cBioHome3D,\u201d a 600-square-foot single-family unit which it says is the world\u2019s first 100% bio-based 3D-printed home, built from local wood fiber and bio-resin materials. \u201cWhen they\u2019re doing concrete, they\u2019re only printing the walls,\u201d says Dagher. He adds that the floor, roof and walls of the BioHome3D were all printed. Concrete homes also need to be built on site, he says. That can be problematic, especially during the snowy New England winter. \u201cWhen the weather goes bad for two weeks at a time, you can\u2019t print,\u201d he adds. By contrast, ASCC printed prefabricated modules at the university and bolted them together on site to create BioHome3D. The new printer can produce objects as large as 96 feet long by 32 feet wide by 18 feet\u202fhigh and can print up to 500 pounds per hour. Dagher says that the goal is to be able to print 1,000 pounds of material in an hour. At that rate, it could reproduce the BioHome3D in 48 hours, he says. If they can reach that target, their 3D-printed homes will be \u201cvery competitive with current housing construction costs,\u201d he adds. But it can be difficult to process wood materials at such a high speed. Even ASCC\u2019s record-breaking printers sometimes jam. While printing BioHome3D, for example, the printer stopped working due to a dust buildup. \u201cNobody\u2019s ever done this before with these kinds of materials,\u201d says Dagher. \u2018When can I have one?\u2019 The BioHome3D\u2019s warm wooden floors and walls give it the look of a sleek, modern Scandinavian-inspired log cabin. \u201cMany people feel concrete is a cold thing to look at and it\u2019s not necessarily where you want to live,\u201d says Dagher. The BioHome3D, however, is \u201cvery warm and inviting.\u201d It\u2019s also sustainable. When a home is no longer needed or wanted it can be ground up and used to print something else. ASCC is using wood residuals from Maine\u2019s sawmills in its research, and looking into scaling up production using these local byproducts. Thousands of people have toured the prototype on the university\u2019s Orono, Maine campus, and Dagher says it\u2019s a rare occurrence when a visitor doesn\u2019t ask, \u201c\u2019When can I have one?\u2019\u201d \u201cWe hear, \u2018You know, I\u2019m retiring, and I want to downsize. Can I put one of these up?\u2019\u201d Dagher says. There are some obstacles to overcome first. \u201cIt takes years for codes to change,\u201d says Dagher, referring to building codes that construction companies must meet. The printer won\u2019t displace traditional home construction, but in the future 3D printed homes are likely to comprise a larger share of the world\u2019s housing stock, he predicts. The ASCC is now doing work on how to incorporate conduits for wiring and plumbing \u201cexactly where an architect would want them\u201d into the printing process, he adds. The printer\u2019s next big project is a nine-home neighborhood for people experiencing homelessness. ASCC is partnering with a local NGO to design the structures, and printing is set to kick off in 2025.", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/worlds-largest-3d-printer-homes-maine-hnk-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_06_02_style_tschabalala-self-artist-painting-black-bodies", "text": "Both a source of inspiration and a place to ground herself, Harlem holds a special meaning for the artist Tschabalala Self. \u201cIt definitely sculpted my personal worldview,\u00a0style and perspective,\u201d said Self of the Manhattan neighborhood, her hometown, famed for fostering generations of Black creatives, artists and intellectuals. \u201cIt\u2019s this world within the world of New York, the largest and most vibrant city in the world. I\u2019ve always been very proud to be from Harlem.\u201d This pride is most recently manifested in her latest exhibition, \u201cAround the Way,\u201d currently on show at the Espoo Museum of Modern Art, Finland. The show\u2019s title is a nod to Black American slang, referring \u201cto someone who\u2019s from our neighborhood,\u201d she told CNN. From referencing the brownstone brick-patterned architecture to real-life friends, family and local residents, the works on display serve as Self\u2019s homage \u2014 and tribute \u2014 to her Harlem. Self has become known in particular, perhaps, for featuring fuller figured Black women in her artworks, and incorporating sewn fabric and printmaking techniques. The Black female body is \u201cmy visual language, my visual aesthetic,\u201d she explained. \u201cThat\u2019s my muse.\u201d Her work has been shown at institutions including MoMA PS1 in New York City, LA\u2019s Hammer Museum, and London\u2019s Parasol unit \u2014 and on numerous occasions in Harlem-based galleries. As a multidisciplinary creative, she works across fields including sculpture, performance, fashion and more, and is also as editor-in-chief at arts and visual culture magazine Elephant. Yet she\u2019s most at home describing herself as a painter, and credits her training in printmaking as heavily influencing her practice. \u201cI personally think of painting as being more of a philosophy than a literal application of paint,\u201d she said of her work, which is rooted in how different colors relate to each other. This relationship can then be replicated through other mixed media, including fabrics. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to think about new and innovative ways to approach painting\u2026 I describe it more as assemblage because the fabric is so dimensional,\u201d she explained of the appliqu\u00e9 techniques in which she works with fabrics on stretched canvas. \u201cSimilar to how other painters have a palette, I have hundreds of bits and scraps of fabrics\u2026 It\u2019s basically an accumulation of all my different fragmented memories or impressions from individuals that I knew well, or that I just happened upon,\u201d she continued. \u201c\u201cThrough the formal aspects of my work, I\u2019m able to address my central conceptual concern that one\u2019s identity is really the sum of many parts. Some of these parts are inherent, but others are projected and collected.\u201d This sense of collecting and gathering is epitomized in a piece in the new show, titled \u201cAnthurium.\u201d The work blends sewn, painted and printed elements to create a scene of domesticity \u2014 a key focal point of Self\u2019s work previously explored in her \u201cHome Body\u201d series, which depicted scenes of intimacy and interiority. Self\u2019s own relationship with the concept of home has evolved in recent years. Now based in upstate New York, the process of leaving her childhood home prompted her to investigate the significance of domestic spaces, both real and imagined. \u201cI think that the home is an actual site, but it also occupies an emotional and psychological space in people\u2019s minds,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s symbolic of something other than what it really is in reality, and those are the kind of environments I like to explore in my artwork.\u201d When considering Self\u2019s body of work on display in \u201cAround the Way,\u201d and more broadly, it\u2019s also clear that the physical body embodies a further exploration of \u201chome\u201d as a place of belonging, of community and of self-care. Her figures are as at home in their physicality as they are  in the world. She describes her approach to rendering and depicting Black women in particular as \u201can instinct,\u201d but she says that she was able to articulate this further through researching the significance of the Rubenesque figure. \u201cIt was interesting to me that the women had this physical aesthetic that was speaking to their abundance and plentitude. They did not have any need,\u201d she said. In her own practice then, this sense of abundance shows up in the way Self\u2019s characters boldly claim space within the picture frame, with their power rooted in their identity, femininity and physicality. This conversation with the traditional western canon of painting is ongoing for Self, and influences other facets of her work. In March 2024, Self was awarded the prestigious public art commission for London\u2019s Fourth Plinth \u2014 her sculpture, \u201cLady in Blue,\u201d will sit atop one of the plinths in Trafalgar Square, a landmark and tourist destination in the city also renowned for its commitment to highlighting contemporary art, starting in 2026. The piece will be a bronze statue of a Black woman striding in movement forward, wearing a bright blue dress. That color was inspired by lapis lazuli and ultramarine, a rare pigment used with significance in the western art canon. \u201cA lot of classical paintings have used lapis lazuli to denote a sense of honor and prestige to a revered figure. I wanted to use this color\u2026 to bestow that same significance.\u201d \u201cEspecially being an American artist, I think it\u2019s a great honor and I feel a lot of trust from the people of London,\u201d Self said. In thinking about the concept for \u201cLady in Blue,\u201d Self considered the increased attention on monuments, particularly in recent years. Instead of uplifting or exalting individuals, her preferred approach is to look to symbolic representations of shared identities and societies instead. But the commission also represents much more than the sculpture\u2019s identity or physicality alone, added the artist. \u201cIt\u2019s about having a figure that can simultaneously speak to the future and the past, and I honestly feel like a Black female figure is the best figure to do that for a number of cultural and historical reasons. \u2018Lady in Blue\u2019 can be seen as an historical mother, but also as a representation of our collective future.\u201d Tschabalala Self: Around the Way is presented in collaboration with the Saastamoinen Foundation at EMMA\u2013Espoo Museum of Modern Art from 8 May 2024 - 5 May 2025 as part of the In Collection exhibition series.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/style/tschabalala-self-artist-painting-black-bodies/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_style_paris-haute-couture-week-2024", "text": "Since the 19th century, haute couture has been bringing together both ancient craftsmanship and the evolving needs of clients, as social backdrops shift and change, aiming to provide a rarefied elegance for the happy few who can afford it. \u201cCouture serves to maintain France\u2019s excellency on a world map, both in terms of creation and know-how, also serving as a conservatory of traditions inherited from as far back as Louis XIV\u201d explained Alice Litscher, professor at Paris\u2019s Institut Fran\u00e7ais de la Mode in an interview. In the wake of last week\u2019s Haute Couture Fashion Week and in the midst of the decisive\u00a0French elections, a general sense of unrest is palpable in the country. Even though politics have been increasingly present on the ready-to-wear runways, the couture collections reflect focus back on the garments, offering quiet excellence for some, and a \u2014 much-needed \u2014 space for fantasy for others. Practical reality A few weeks after Chanel announced the\u00a0departure of creative director Virginie Viard\u00a0(who took over Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s position in 2019), the house unveiled a new collection \u2014 albeit designed by the studio. Presented in the grandiose Opera Garnier, it explored elegance in a hushed, restrained manner, safely building on the well-established, transgenerational style vocabulary of the house: Richly embroidered and bejeweled pastel tweeds, skirt-suits embellished with ruffled sleeves, long dress-coats, hair pulled back with oversized black bows and, fittingly, considering the venue, opera capes aimed at a clientele who travels, dines, but might not cherish social-media-ready pieces. At Patou, the \u201cRose\u201d collection also suggested a quiet sense of elevation. \u201cThis season, I want the Patou woman to be committed, but not necessarily to have the appearance of her commitment\u2026 I want her to be fresh before anything,\u201d said creative director Guillaume Henry backstage \u2014 perhaps suggesting a move away from the performative activism of recent years. He showcased candy and floral toned daily pieces, tailored denim, functional knitwear, shirt dresses, a play on accessories with neck scarves and gold detailing, saying his work at Patou is \u201cthe alliance of elegance, form, simplicity and joy.\u201d As show notes underline, this era is a sensible one: \u201cPatou\u2019s Rose is a collection grounded in reality: a practical one.\u201d Entering their Villain Era Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung developed the concept of a \u201cshadow self,\u201d the dark facet to every identity:\u00a0\u201cOne does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious,\u201d the philosopher wrote. That notion, also known in modern parlance as \u201centering a villain era\u201d has become surprisingly popular on TikTok, and also ran through several collections. At Charles de Vilmorin, for a collection entitled \u201cR\u00eaveuse Bourgeoise\u201d (Dreamy Bourgeoise), the show was set up as a play, filled with visual elements fit for fairy tales or \u201ccommedia dell\u2019arte\u201d (Italian comedy) plays: a rodent mask, feathers aflame, drapes and capes; each seeming to evoke a grandiose baddie fit for a historical drama. Gowns with the flair of theater costumes (a distinct departure from his ready-to-wear garments) turned haute couture into an escape from reality. At Robert Wun, on the other hand, each silhouette evolved to a different element. For his tenth anniversary, the designer presented a collection revolving around time, showing cycles of life, metamorphosis, death even; playing with the darker facets of the human experience (including a full skull mask). Decaying flowers, flesh, bones and skulls were all referenced in the collection and textiles, celebrating the multifaceted, transient nature of life. Science meets nature For some designers, couture is also a laboratory of experimentation \u2014 including\u00a0Iris Van Herpen, who combined savoir-faire in areas including technology, science and art. The designer showed aerial sculptures featuring models embedded in the garments and hung to the wall.\u00a0The collection also included pieces replicating the effects of waves on the sand and sea, dresses that played with a gradient of pearls (some sculpted with a heat gun) and a process fusing organza with 3D printing and lace. These creations are the result of a discussion with French chemist Emmanuel Farge from Institut Marie Curie:\u00a0\u201cabout\u00a0the primal organisms within the sea 700 million years ago and how they have changed our senses (and what we) experience today\u201d said the designer during the presentation, elaborating upon how nature informs her sensitivity and creative eye. In a similar vein,\u00a0ArdAzAei\u00a0explored how geometry and mathematics reveal rhythms of nature, imagined by\u00a0Bahareh Ardakani, founder and artistic director of the house. She played with some notions of quantum physics and their potential visual impact, and explored how multiple dimensions of string theory, laid flat, can look like flower petals. This was materialized in silk and satin petals on envelope skirts, fishtailed gowns, both geometric and natural, crystals arranged in floral compositions and via the use of double embroidery for a \u201cbig bang effect of light exploding from a dress\u201d she said. Conceptual couture Viktor and Rolf\u2019s \u201cHaute Abstraction\u201d collection looked, as show notes pointed out, to \u201cexpress a certain absurdism.\u201d Evoking their \u201cAtomic Bomb\u201d collection from 1998, it played with geometrical shapes, squares and spheres, both childlike and conceptual. \u201cWe were thinking of something abstract, like boxes, cubes, balls, and combining them with the human body. When we are in the mood for abstraction, we get a feeling of freedom\u2026 There is no interpretation, but a moment of space,\u201d said the duo backstage, adding that this was achieved in \u201cvery couture-oriented materials\u201d such as silk duchesse, Lurex and jacquard. In a different vein, designer Rahul Mishra\u2019s collection, \u201cAura,\u201d quoted mysticism and the universe for a spiritual, experimental take on fashion.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026all about creating something intangible, something we know exists, but we cannot see\u201d he said backstage. The statuesque, surrealist silhouettes were created with metal structures and glass elements, all contrasting with embellishment and hand embroidery, and all made in India, where the designer lives. The color black used throughout the pieces designates \u201ca condensation of all colors, mystery, infinity,\u201d he explained. Sporty elevation With the approach of the Olympic Games, Dior jumped on the occasion \u201cThis d\u00e9fil\u00e9 represents an extraordinary opportunity to combine couture and sportswear with classicism, rebellion, collective energy\u201d the show notes report, and in front of a fresco of women athletes, the show paid tribute to \u201csportives,\u201d with peplum elements, draping, silk dresses, skirts that revealed draped trousers, as well as moir\u00e9 jacquard, for a sporty, effect and sense of a body in motion. For Balenciaga, (also notable for drag queen Alexis Stone\u2019s appearance impersonating Miranda Priestley from 2006 movie \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada\u201d), the show was an occasion to merge founder Cristobal Balenciaga\u2019s DNA with \u201ca tribute to subculture codes,\u201d including a hand-dyed faux fur coat in synthetic hair; a knitted, embroidered goth maxi dress featuring black upcycled beads and jackets worn tied around the hips reworked into trousers \u2014 all elevating the often mundane. And, as every year, Jean-Paul Gaultier invited a new designer to present under his name. This time head of Courr\u00e8ges Nicolas Di Felice, known for his sporty, techno-inspired wear, showed a minimalist collection, evoking a sporty, contemporary life-gone-couture. This included a sheath dress in tulle held together with 42,000 hooks and a trompe-l\u2019\u0153il dress, each model with sheathed face, asking, perhaps, for anonymity\u2026 Something scarce in 2024.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/style/paris-haute-couture-week-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_style_india-elections-purple-voter-ink-intl-hnk", "text": "India\u2019s massive, twice-a-decade exercise in democracy is once again leaving its mark on the country\u2019s people, in the form of purple-streaked index fingers. The Election Commission uses indelible ink, or \u201cvoter ink\u201d, to prevent fraud or duplicate votes. Once a voter arrives at the booth to cast their ballot and has their ID verified, the ink is painted across the top of their left index finger, leaving a stain that can take up to two weeks to wash off. It may be rudimentary, but the method has been so effective that it\u2019s been in place for more than seven decades. \u201cRight from the prime minister to the most common person, everybody flashes their (marked) finger,\u201d said K Mohammed Irfan, managing director of Mysore Varnish and Paints Limited (MVPL), the state-owned company that exclusively makes and distributes the liquid to polling booths across the nation. \u201cFrom celebrities to film stars\u2026 (it has become) a mark of democracy that I think is synonymous with elections,\u201d he told CNN in a video interview. More than 960 million people are eligible to vote in India\u2019s election, the world\u2019s biggest. And workers at the company\u2019s factory in Mysuru, a city in southwestern Karnataka state, have spent months preparing nearly 2.7 million ink\u00a0vials, its largest order to date. The orange containers were filled and carefully packed for distribution ahead of this year\u2019s elections, which are underway and end\u00a0June 1. Each vial contains enough liquid to mark approximately 700 voters. The key to the ink\u2019s literal staying power? A tightly guarded formula which has remained unchanged since 1951. \u201cIndelible ink serves no other purpose,\u201d said Irfan. \u201cWe only manufacture the required quantity.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0While Irfan says the company is \u201cbound to secrecy\u201d when it comes to the ink\u2019s exact composition, it does contain the chemical compound silver nitrate, which causes a purplish stain when it comes into contact with skin and is exposed to sunlight. One dab at a time When newly independent India held its first-ever general elections in 1951 and 1952, organizers turned to the idea of using indelible ink to mark voters, in efforts to ensure a fair ballot. \u201cIn a country where there was no systematic registration of births, or identity documents, and with millions of people on the move as refugees, the question of how to prevent impersonation and double voting was a source of great concern,\u201d said Ornit Shani, author of \u201cHow India Became Democratic: Citizenship and the Making of the Universal Franchise.\u201d Some officials thought the method would take too much time and complicate the voting process, according to Shani, but public opinion eventually won out. \u201cCombined with the practice that all voters, irrespective of their caste, class and religions would stand in the same line, (having to wait) for their turn to have their finger marked (before they) cast their vote, further contributed to making concrete and visible the core value of the equality of the vote,\u201d Shani said in an email to CNN. \u201cOne man, one woman, one vote.\u201d Lasting appeal MVPL was founded as a paint supplier in 1937 by the then maharaja or ruler of Mysore, Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV, and retains that side\u00a0of its business. According to Irfan, when the company isn\u2019t producing ink, it\u2019s supplying, among other products, paint for the public transport sector. The ink\u2019s appeal has spilled beyond India\u2019s borders too. The company now supplies indelible ink to more than 35 countries, including to Ghana beginning in the late 1970s. However, Ghana\u2019s election commission recently announced it would phase out the use of indelible ink, opting for biometric verification methods instead. But the use of the ink in India doesn\u2019t appear to be going away any time soon. For Mukulika Banerjee, an associate professor of anthropology at the London School of Economics, the practice of marking a body may not translate well in other cultures, but it works in India due to common\u00a0cultural practices. \u201cPeople routinely have their hands decorated with henna, or women have their feet decorated with different colors,\u201d said Banerjee in a phone interview. \u201cI would argue that the marking of the finger (semi-permanently) kind of fits into it in a way that it might not fit in other contexts.\u201d She also pointed to an unintentional effect of marking voters with ink: creating an environment of peer pressure. Banerjee was able to find instances of this during her research on democracy and elections in West Bengal. \u201cFirst thing on polling day people do is check out each other\u2019s fingers,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if your left index finger is not carrying the indelible mark, they\u2019ll look at you and the first thing they\u2019ll say is \u2018Why haven\u2019t you voted?\u2019 \u201cYou can make excuses, but by the fifth time in the day, if somebody asks you and it gets so annoying, it\u2019s actually easier to go and vote than to not vote.\u201d The peer pressure extends to movie stars and athletes, who are likely to post their ink-stained fingers to their millions of fans on social media. \u201cThese guys have begun to hold up (their fingers) and take selfies of having voted and say \u2018I\u2019ve voted, have you?\u2019 because they feel they have a civic duty to encourage others to vote as well,\u201d she added. \u201cSo it becomes aspirational; then you want to be like your hero and you want to be able to do the same thing.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/india-elections-purple-voter-ink-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_style_marina-abramovic-glastonbury-crowd-silence", "text": "On Friday, Marina Abramovi\u0107 staged a collective seven minute silence at the UK\u2019s biggest music festival. In case her messaging was unclear, the Serbian artist wore a white sculptural column dress that, when her arms were outstretched, opened out into a peace sign. World-famous for her seemingly fearless approach to performance art, Abramovi\u0107 once invited members of the public to interact with her however they liked during a 6-hour sitting. The 1974 piece, titled \u201cRhythm 0,\u201d resulted in a loaded gun being held to her head. On the Glastonbury main stage Abramovi\u0107\u00a0asked the festival\u2019s 250,000 attendees to turn inward.\u00a0\u201cPeople come to have a good time. They\u2019re drinking, taking drugs, the weather is good,\u201d she told Vogue ahead of the event. \u201cBut I\u2019m asking them to be silent and to reflect on the state of this planet, which is really hell right now.\u201d If silencing a music festival the size of a small English town wasn\u2019t powerful enough, the artist\u00a0also chose an outfit to remember. Standing tall, her shoulders sloped to create the top of the peace sign \u2014 her hands lost in the round of the giant white sleeves. At hip level, more fabric jutted out to create the upside-down \u2018V\u2019 shape. The dress, designed by her friend and former Burberry creative director Riccardo Tisci, was inspired by the Japanese kimono. According to Abramovi\u0107, it will eventually be exhibited in a museum. While we\u2019re more familiar seeing peace signs printed on crop tops or canvas tote bags, Abramovi\u0107 and Tisci\u2019s IRL-rendering is closer to the symbol\u2019s creation story. Designed by British artist Gerald Holtom, the icon first debuted on a London peace march in 1958 and was later adopted by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). Holtom wrote that the idea for the sign came from his own human form. \u201cI drew myself: the representation of an individual in despair, with hands and palms outstretched, outwards and downwards in the manner of Goya\u2019s peasant before the firing squad. I formalized the drawing into a line and put a circle round it.\u201d More than six decades later, Holtom\u2019s peace sign has become one of the world\u2019s most recognized symbols \u2014 particularly on the runway. Throughout the years, it has adorned everything from Fendi Baguette bags to Dior knitwear. At Moschino in 2014, the design was fashioned into luxurious pendants on heavy, golden donkey rope chains; while the following year at Chanel, it appeared in Sharpie-style scrawl on distressed messenger bags \u2014 a punctuation mark to the revised phrase \u201cMake fashion, not war.\u201d Abramovi\u0107\u2019s outfit was very much in-keeping with Glastonbury\u2019s overarching theme for 2024: Peace. Holtom\u2019s sign was seen throughout the festival grounds, crowning the roof of the newly erected Peace Stage, and earlier in the week, appearing in the sky during the event\u2019s first ever drone display. As she faced the crowd, Abramovi\u0107 surrendered to the power of the symbol sewn into her dress. \u201cSee how we can feel positive energy in the entire universe,\u201d she told on-lookers.

{"id": "2024_04_29_style_dodecahedron-roman-object-mystery-scn-scli-intl", "text": "Amateur archaeologists in England have unearthed one of the largest Roman dodecahedrons ever found, but mystery surrounds what it was actually used for. The 12-sided object is one of just 33 known to exist in Roman Britain, and one of approximately 130 in the world. It is considered \u201cone of archaeology\u2019s great enigmas,\u201d according to the Norton Disney History and Archaeology Group, an amateur group based in the English region of Lincolnshire where it was found in June. Measuring about 8 centimeters (3 inches) across, the dodecahedron is hollow and covered with 12 holes of varying sizes. The 1,700-year-old object will be displayed at the Lincoln Museum from May 4 until early September. \u201cIt\u2019s a real pleasure to have the Norton Disney dodecahedron joining us\u2026 just a stone\u2019s throw from where it was found,\u201d Andrea Martin, exhibitions and interpretations manager at the museum, said in a Lincolnshire County Council press release. \u201cTo have the opening of the display coincide with the Lincoln Festival of History is a real coup.\u201d The release describes the dodecahedron as \u201cone of the largest examples\u201d discovered. However, experts still aren\u2019t sure exactly what the Romans used the dodecahedron for. \u201cIt is completely unique,\u201d said Richard Parker, secretary of the Norton Disney History and Archaeology Group, adding that no similar objects have ever been found. He said that, unlike other dodecahedra, this one is undamaged. \u201cOurs is absolutely in a fabulous condition. It\u2019s complete, undamaged, and it clearly was considered of great value by whoever made it and by those that used it,\u201d Parker said. \u201cSo there must have been a very important reason for it to be deposited in the ground in the way that it was.\u201d Parker told CNN there are no descriptions of the dodecahedron in Roman literature, and they have not been depicted pictorially in mosaics. There are also several features that make it difficult to discern what its intended purpose was. All of the dodecahedra are of different sizes, meaning they were not used for measurement, he said. Because it is undamaged with no signs of wear, it is unlikely to have been a tool, Parker added. Parker\u2019s group does have one working theory, however. \u201cMost likely they were some form of religious or ritual object,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Romans were a very superstitious lot, and generally required signs to allow them to make decisions in their daily lives.\u201d One indication supporting that idea is that the object was found near a small Roman mounted rider god figurine with \u201cstrong religious connections,\u201d Parker said. The artifact was discovered in 1989 by metal detectorists, and the figurine is \u201coften found on temple sites.\u201d The organization plans to return to the dig site later this year to conduct further excavations, which Parker hopes will help establish context on how the area was used. Parker said he is optimistic that the mystery will be solved because this dodecahedron was found in an archaeological excavation area, whereas \u201cmany of those that were found 200 or 300 years ago had no context to where they were found.\u201d \u201cIt is quite a complex story to tell that we\u2019re just starting to tease out,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/29/style/dodecahedron-roman-object-mystery-scn-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}

Four other trainees at a martial arts academy near the Shaolin Temple in China\u2019s Henan province lounge nonchalantly, seemingly unaware of the gravity-defying action taking place above their heads. Their bright orange robes and\u00a0Feiyue\u00a0sneakers stand in contrast to the earthen wall behind them. The blurred back of a man on the left side of the image highlights the sharp movement at its center. A monk stretching in the background demonstrates his dexterity in a split-like stance. \u201cThere\u2019s this high-level action,\u201d photographer Steve McCurry told CNN of the photo\u2019s composition in a video call from his home in Philadelphia. \u201cAnd these other boys are just hanging out.\u201d The\u00a0image\u00a0is featured in Magnum\u2019s\u00a0Square Print Sale, which ends May 5,\u00a0alongside other photographers\u2019 works.\u00a0He shot it back in 2004,\u00a0as part of a personal project, while traveling the world to document various forms of Buddhism. While he doesn\u2019t consider himself to be Buddhist, McCurry has long been interested in the religion and applies some of its\u00a0principles to his own life. The Shaolin Temple \u2013 which was founded in\u00a0AD 495\u00a0on the slopes of the sacred Mount Song \u2013\u00a0is said to be the home of Chan Buddhism. Although the religion emphasizes nonviolence, the temple\u2019s warrior monks initially practiced martial arts to defend themselves from\u00a0bandits. Over time, their rigorous physical training became inexorably linked with their quest to achieve enlightenment. Today, Shaolin kung fu is widely known, and the monks\u2019 feats in athleticism have been emulated in popular movies.\u00a0The 1982 movie \u201cThe Shaolin Temple,\u201d which launched Jet Li\u2019s career and was filmed on location, was one of the films that brought renewed interest in the monastery. By the time McCurry visited in 2004,\u00a0dozens of martial arts schools had sprung up on the road leading up to the temple. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible to watch them perform and train,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine that people can actually do that with their bodies.\u201d A career on the road McCurry started his career working at a local newspaper after graduating from Pennsylvania State University. He then started traveling abroad as a freelance photographer, shooting images of people in some of the world\u2019s most dangerous and remote places. His career took off in earnest after he snuck across the border from Pakistan into Afghanistan in 1979, right before the Soviet invasion.\u00a0He smuggled film out\u00a0by hiding it in his clothing,\u00a0providing the world some of the first photos of the conflict that left at least 500,000 Afghans dead and millions displaced. His 1984\u00a0\u201cAfghan girl\u201d\u00a0photograph \u2013 which captured the piercing green eyes of a 12-year-old refugee in Peshawar, Pakistan and was featured on National Geographic magazine\u2019s June 1985 cover \u2013 is one of the world\u2019s most famous photos. Over the course of his 50-year career, McCurry,\u00a0now 74,\u00a0has filled more than 20 passports, snapping animals and festivals, worshippers and fighters,\u00a0conflicts\u00a0and catastrophes\u00a0in destinations from Niger to India.\u00a0He captures the ancient against the modern, the curious amid the day-to-day and accentuates the familiarity of strangers. In 2016, McCurry came under fire when one of his photos in an exhibition was discovered to be digitally altered. He\u00a0said\u00a0it had happened in his studio while he was out traveling, but more images that appeared to be manipulated began surfacing, igniting a debate around the ethics of photojournalism. In response\u00a0to the allegations, the photographer told Time magazine\u00a0later that year that beyond the\u00a0brief stint at the local newspaper in Pennsylvania, he had never been employed by a newspaper, news magazine or news outlet. As a freelancer, he had taken on various assignments, including advertising campaigns. He said his work had \u201cmigrated into the fine art field\u201d and that he considered himself a \u201cvisual storyteller.\u201d He added that he understood it could be \u201cconfusing \u2026 for people who think I\u2019m still a photojournalist,\u201d and that going forward, he would only use Photoshop \u201cin a minimal way, even for my own work taken on personal trips.\u201d \u2018Going back again and again\u2019 Before shooting the photograph of the wall-running monk, McCurry had already paid a visit to the Shaolin Temple two decades earlier.\u00a0He says it was \u201creally empty\u201d during that first trip, and he saw only \u201cbicycles and people in these Mao suits.\u201d By the time he returned, a kung fu craze had gripped the nation.\u00a0The area\u00a0felt more commercial, he recalled.\u00a0Tens of thousands of (mostly) Chinese boys and men were inspired by a wave of kung fu movies, and were training at the\u00a0dozens of schools in the area. The photographer was granted permission at one of the academies and spent a few days with the monks as they went about their daily routine, which included practicing acrobatics on repeat.\u00a0Some of the boys ate with McCurry at a noodle joint across the street, sharing their hopes to eventually land jobs in security services, performance troupes, as well as the entertainment industry.\u00a0\u201cThey were normal kids,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they were very, very dedicated and serious about this practice.\u201d He captured other photographs of monks\u2019 intense training regimes during his stay, including several hanging upside down by their feet, hands calmly pressed into a prayer pose. McCurry\u00a0sought to find the right combination of variables like the subject, angle, light, and background, as the monks perfected their moves.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a (matter) of photographing and going back again and again.\u201d His perseverance paid off.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a picture that evokes a lot of emotion,\u201d he said of the final shot of the wall-running monk. \u201cIt either brings a smile to people\u2019s faces, or they\u2019re kind of in awe of the physicality of these young boys.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/03/style/steve-mccurry-shaolin-monks-photo-intl-hnk-snap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}

Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}

Some passersby even joined emergency services to run inside the burning building and help carry large Renaissance paintings and other objects away from the blaze. Among the paintings saved was Danish artist Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s 1895 work \u201cFrom the Copenhagen Stock Exchange,\u201d the Chamber of Commerce said. Denmark\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, called the fire \u201cour own Notre Dame moment,\u201d referring to the blaze that destroyed the roof and spire of the Paris cathedral, five years ago almost to the day. The fire began at around 8.30 a.m. local time (2.30 a.m. ET), a Copenhagen fire department chief told CNN, and by 11 a.m. nearly half of the building had been destroyed. The fire was still burning by late afternoon. The Chamber of Commerce said it is \u201cat a loss for words for how great a tragedy this is.\u201d It said it was \u201ca sad day for our country\u201d and that \u201cthe damage will unfortunately be very expensive.\u201d \u201cWe have tried to rescue a lot of historic paintings that were inside the building and the historic furniture,\u201d Jakob Vedsted Andersen, an executive director at the Greater Copenhagen fire and rescue service, told CNN. He said it was \u201cway too soon\u201d to speculate about the causes of the blaze. Copenhagen police have told people to avoid the area and there have been no reported injuries so far. People were in the building when the fire started but they were all evacuated, said a police spokesperson who added that military personnel were at the scene to support fire-fighting efforts. A \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d is on fire, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said, calling the building\u2019s cultural heritage \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d The B\u00f8rsen building has been at the heart of Danish business since the 17th century. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt said 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he added in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Emergency services were working to control the fire but it had spread to all floors through the elevator shaft. Frank Trier Mikkelsen, operations manager at the Greater Copenhagen fire department, said the fire is burning \u201cviolently\u201d inside the building, according to TV 2, a government-owned TV channel. Forty firefighters were inside the building, with valuables being rescued, TV 2 reported. Mikkelsen told the Danish broadcaster that the fire is of a type that emergency managers dread, explaining parts of the building\u2019s roof need to be removed to extinguish it. He added machines have been called in to remove some of the copper roof, as the water just bounces off it.

{"id": "2023_07_03_style_felipe-romero-beltran-dialect-spain-migration", "text": "Photographer Felipe Romero Beltr\u00e1n\u2019s depiction of a migrant facility in Spain oozes with the boredom and malaise of life in legal limbo. His young subjects are seen smoking cigarettes, lifting weights and trimming one another\u2019s hair. Other images show them hanging out in a grubby yard or lying around on mattresses. The photos were shot with the help of nine young Moroccans whom Beltr\u00e1n befriended in Seville, capital of the southern region of Andaluc\u00eda. Published in his new book \u201cDialect,\u201d the pictures were initially intended to be personal, not political. But they ultimately spoke to what Beltr\u00e1n called a \u201cKafka-esque\u201d system in which the men waited for years to learn whether their residency applications would be approved. \u201cAt the beginning, it was just about this group of guys,\u201d Beltr\u00e1n said on a video call from Madrid. \u201cBut of course, I realized that I was photographing these really specific political bodies, or political subjects in this bureaucracy.\u201d Last year, nearly 30,000 migrants arrived in Spain by sea, down from a record of over 58,000 in 2018, according to UNHCR data. Of these, most arrived in the Canary Islands or Andaluc\u00eda, a region separated from Morocco by the Strait of Gibraltar, a stretch of water just 13 kilometers (eight miles) at its narrowest. The nine men, who didn\u2019t previously know one another, were among those to arrive by boat during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic in search of a better life. Recounting his journey with an essay in \u201cDialect,\u201d one of Beltr\u00e1n\u2019s subjects, Youssef Elhafidi, recalls another terrified teen migrant being forced by smugglers to pilot their boat. \u201cHe did not want to drive, the fear was paralyzing him, they took out a knife and put it on his neck, threatening him to start the engines,\u201d Elhafidi wrote. \u201cThe boy started the machine between trembling and crying and we headed north.\u201d Killing time According to Beltr\u00e1n, his nine subjects were required to stay in Spain for three continuous years before applying for residency. Undocumented and without the right to work during this time, they were dependent on the state for food and housing. While living at the government-run facility, the men took Spanish lessons and joined workshops to help them adapt to life in Spain \u2014 some of which were run by Beltr\u00e1n. Overcoming an initial language barrier, the photographer began working with the group to produce images and videos. As well as candid portraits, the pictures focus on conditions at the facility, from peeling walls to basic food supplies. Many of the images were, however, staged. As Beltr\u00e1n looked for different ways to engage with his subjects, he asked them to re-enact moments from their respective migration journeys. In one, a subject lies motionless on blue gym mats, just as he had upon landing on Spain\u2019s coast. Another shows two of the men carrying a third on their shoulders to recreate the moment he fainted during a day-long walk to Seville from a small town to its south. The resulting book is thus part documentary and part performance, with Beltr\u00e1n toeing the line between mentor and collaborator, photographer and choreographer. More than just an artistic decision, staging photos directly responded to the tedium of the migrants\u2019 abundant free time. \u201cThere was an activity around taking the images \u2014 it was something during the day that (could get them) excited. And it was fun,\u201d Beltr\u00e1n recalled. \u201cEveryone was laughing, and they just make jokes each other during the sessions.\u201d Lost in translation When Beltr\u00e1n began delivering workshops at the facility in 2020, he was all too familiar with the system his subjects were trapped in. A few years earlier, he had relocated to Spain from his native Colombia, and \u2014 even as a college-educated Spanish speaker \u2014 also struggled to navigate the complex immigration processes. To illustrate the challenge facing his francophone subjects, his project included a video titled \u201cRecital\u201d in which they attempted to read the first four pages of the Spanish immigration law that would determine their futures. \u201cThey weren\u2019t understanding a word,\u201d he recalled, noting that, although lawyers were assigned to act on the men\u2019s behalf, the language barrier and dense legalese removed their agency. The opening pages of \u201cDialect\u201d \u2014 whose title alludes to these very linguistical challenges \u2014 are dedicated to stills from the video. Pictures of the men struggling to comprehend the legislation are overlaid with technical terminology (\u201cRight to effective judicial protection\u201d reads the text on one frame; another says, \u201cAuthorizations for the purpose of carrying out profit-making activities\u201d). \u201cThese legal procedures are really, really complicated, even for native speakers,\u201d said Beltr\u00e1n, who is now completing a PhD program in photography in Madrid. \u201cIt becomes almost like translation work \u2014 translating these laws and bureaucracies into (something understandable to) normal people like us.\u201d The result, he said, is an inevitable sense of helplessness. \u201cYou can\u2019t talk with anyone,\u201d Beltr\u00e1n added. \u201cYou can\u2019t ask, \u2018Who is the law?\u2019 or \u2018Who is the state?\u2019 You don\u2019t have anyone to approach. You don\u2019t have any tools to make a living\u2026 The system is built to avoid you, or to deny you access to (it).\u201d Describing the group as \u201cjust young people trying to figure out what to do with life,\u201d the photographer hopes his project can humanize migrants\u2019 experiences in a world increasingly desensitized to images of their suffering. Since Beltr\u00e1n completed his project, most of his subjects have completed their three-year wait and now formally reside in Spain, he says. He remains in touch with some \u2014 including Elhafidi, who he says works in a restaurant and has accompanied him at promotional events for the book\u2019s launch. In the conclusion of his essay, Elhafidi recalled how he felt when he secured his residency, writing: \u201cIt took me three years of searching and putting courage to life, until finally the moment came, after being cold, scared, hungry and the most difficult thing, my mother\u2019s tears\u2026 I got it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI got the papers. Now after getting it I have another look at life, I finally feel that I have the opportunity to be whoever I want to be.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re building their lives,\u201d Beltr\u00e1n said of those, including Elhafidi, who have secured residency. \u201cFortunately, they now can go back to Morocco to visit and see their families.\u201d \u201cDialect,\u201d published by Loose Joints, is available now.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/07/03/style/felipe-romero-beltran-dialect-spain-migration/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}

Two baroque thrones for the bride and groom. But perhaps the most memorable detail of all: The newlyweds dressed in matching purple Antonio Berardi outfits for their reception. This was, of course, the holy union of Victoria and David Beckham. The British power couple got hitched in 1999, fusing the worlds of fashion and football forever.

The painting depicts Jesus, Mary and Joseph resting on their way to Egypt after learning that Herod, King of Judea, wanted to kill the young Christ. Titian, whose real name was Tiziano Vecellio, made the work in the first decade of the 16th century, at the beginning of his career. Measuring just 18.25 inches by 24.75 inches (46.2 centimeters x 62.9 centimeters), the painting is tiny compared with some of the massive works for which Titian became known later in his life. The oil-on-canvas work has a remarkable history. After changing hands among various European aristocrats, the painting was looted by Napoleonic troops during the French occupation of Vienna in 1809 and taken to Paris. It was returned to Vienna in 1815 and again moved through private collections before ending up with John Alexander Thynne, 4th Marquess of Bath, in Wiltshire, England. In 1995, it was stolen from Longleat, the home of Thynne\u2019s descendants, and disappeared for seven years, before it was found at a bus stop in London by art detective Charles Hill.

{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_04_17_style_copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl", "text": "Police launched an investigation Wednesday into the fire that tore through Copenhagen\u2019s famous stock exchange building, causing the collapse of its spire and damaging centuries-old artwork and architecture. The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through\u00a0the building \u2013 known locally as B\u00f8rsen \u2013\u00a0from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen\u00a0police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a \u201ccomplicated process.\u201d Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already \u201cconducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.\u201d \u201cBut of course, there is still a lot to do, especially as we have not yet had the opportunity to examine\u00a0B\u00f8rsen itself,\u201d Belling added. The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. \u201cMy first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be the same but it\u2019s iconic to\u00a0Copenhagen\u00a0and Denmark,\u201d teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters. Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, told the news agency that a firefighter gave him the top of the spire on Wednesday morning after it was recovered following its fall. \u201cIt gives me hope because we have decided to rebuild the stock exchange because it\u2019s part of European history as a trading continent,\u201d he said. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625.

{"id": "2024_03_19_style_big-biba-london-1960s-store-history", "text": "\u201cMy God, it\u2019s dull,\u201d said interior designer Steven Thomas of the British retail landscape in 2024. As the creative force behind the look of the wildly popular 1970s London fashion store Big Biba, Thomas knows a thing or two about engineering excitement. Big Biba \u2014 a daring, 20,000 square foot destination by fashion illustrator Barbara Hulanicki and her former marketing executive husband, Stephen Fitz-Simon \u2014 was conceived with a level of detail usually reserved for high-end concept stores.\u00a0Opened in September 1973,\u00a0it was the\u00a0fourth and final outpost of the-then iconic brand.\u00a0The\u00a0seven-floor Art Deco emporium on London\u2019s fashionable Kensington High Street featured\u00a0a soup stand inspired by Andy Warhol, a roof garden featuring real flamingos and penguins, and a much-lauded celebrity hotspot the \u201cRainbow Room\u201d. \u201cBecause the Rainbow Room looked the way it did, it didn\u2019t take long for the glitterati to latch on; it was very much a place to be seen dining,\u201d recalled Thomas in an interview with CNN. Originally designed by architect Marcel Hennequet in 1933 and named after its multi-colored ceiling (the dining room was otherwise all white tablecloths and fake plants), it \u201cbecame a venue of choice,\u201d he suggested. \u201cDavid Bowie, Mick Jagger, Bryan Ferry all dropped in.\u201d \u201cFitz employed the son of a friend who had an extraordinary knack of picking people up, like Ian Dury and the Blockheads,\u201d continued Thomas, recalling the unofficial booker. \u201cHe got the New York Dolls to play when they came over, another coup. They did a vandalizing tour of the first floor, shoplifting all the women\u2019s clothes.\u201d These stories and more are all explored in \u201cWelcome to Big Biba,\u201d Thomas\u2019s gold-fronted monograph of the venture republished this month by ACC Art Books to celebrate the brand\u2019s 60th anniversary. \u201cThis book is a testament to creative freedom,\u201d writes the now 87-year-old Hulanicki in the foreword, reflecting on her legacy. \u201cYou can do it all as long as you learn to wear a suit. Of course, your secret will be that the suit is lined in gold lam\u00e9.\u201d Making fashion democratic The Biba story began in May 1964 when Hulanicki and Fitz-Simon began running \u201cBiba\u2019s Postal Boutique,\u201d a mail-order store selling limited runs of stock. Singer Annie Lennox described the venture as having led \u201cthe way for those of us living in provincial places where we felt we were dying of drabness.\u201d Inspired by decadent styles from bygone times \u2014 albeit with drastically shortened hemlines \u2014 in earthy or muted colors such as olive, rust and \u201cbruised purple,\u201d Biba\u2019s wares certainly struck a chord with young female shoppers, and the brand rode the wave of what Thomas described as \u201cthe first burst of teenage energy and finance availability.\u201d \u201cBiba made fashion democratic,\u201d explained Martin Pel, author of \u201cThe Biba Years 1963-1975\u201d and curator of a new exhibition at London\u2019s Fashion & Textile Museum, in an email. \u201cThis expression is often overused of designers in the 1960s, particularly Mary Quant. Quant\u2019s clothes whilst youthful, were expensive. Biba was inexpensive, well designed, good quality, and up-to-the-minute.\u201d By September 1964, Hulanicki and Fitz-Simon had opened their first brick and mortar store in a former drugstore, twice moving the business into bigger premises throughout the 60s. In 1966 the brand\u2019s second shop on Kensington Church Street \u2014 where Vogue editor Anna Wintour famously did a stint as a Saturday girl \u2014 was described by Vanity Fair magazine as \u201cthe most exotic shop in London.\u201d and in the early 1970s, a boutique launched in New York\u2019s Bergdorf Goodman department store. \u201cAn act of bravery\u201d Interior designer Thomas had already designed Hulanicki and Fitz-Simon\u2019s home and the third Biba store in 1968 before being approached about the landmark seven-level store. \u201cFitz offered me two floors (of Big Biba) but I wanted it all,\u201d he recalled of his initial involvement. \u201cA moment of complete lunacy, considering Tim (Whitmore, his creative partner) and I were ex-painting students working out of my bedroom. It was an extraordinary act of bravery on their part, giving us the contract, it wouldn\u2019t happen today.\u201d Stocking Big Biba\u2019s seven floors was equal parts intimidating and invigorating said Thomas, explaining that he and Whitmore worked closely with Hulanicki throughout. \u201cBiba was always a reflection of Barbara\u2019s life,\u201d he noted, \u201cso because Barbara had a kid, of course we had a kid\u2019s floor,\u201d with d\u00e9cor inspired by Disney World, a carousel ride and miniature cottage kids caf\u00e9 with toadstool seating. On Saturdays, an actor would visit and read stories and a cr\u00e8che \u2014 a revolutionary concept in fashion retail now, let alone 50 years ago \u2014 allowed parents freedom to explore the other floors. A maternity section and a space for 11-13 year old\u2019s were similarly modern for the time, likewise the introduction of communal changing rooms \u2014 although true to the spirit of the times, many clients reportedly changed in the middle of the store itself. Elsewhere menswear took over the third floor, complete with a \u201cmistress\u201d section for purchasing more sensual items with discretion. Biba-branded household items were upstairs. While each floor took on its own theme (maternity for example was fitted with comedic outsized furniture, inspired by Ken Russell\u2019s 1971 musical comedy \u201cThe Boyfriend\u201d), much of the store was furnished in Biba\u2019s distinctive black and gold colorway, with mirrored fixtures, ostrich feathers and leopard print features. While Wintour\u2019s shopgirl life was short-lived, Big Biba\u2019s staff were a vital component of the experience remembered Thomas. \u201cThey loved working there, it was their club,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if a (customer) bought a Biba poster and stuck it on her wall, she felt part of the club. It was the theater of retail really.\u201d It was an unmitigated success. When the store opened its legendary roof gardens in 1974, they were ushered in by a party described in the British press as \u201clike walking into a film set of rather jolly moral depravity.\u201d Shoppers from all over the country, and even internationally, convened at the store to buy into the zeitgeist. According to Hulanicki, during its two-year run, Big Biba was the number two tourist attraction in the British capital after the Tower of London, with Buckingham Palace being number three. But Biba\u2019s success was short-lived. In 1969, the independent company sold a majority of its shares to another British fashion retailer Dorothy Perkins which, in August 1973 (a month before Big Biba opened), was then bought by a property development company called British Land. The high cost of keeping the store open and the faltering British economy of the mid-70s meant the new owners closed the store\u2019s third and fourth floors in March 1975, and the rest of the store followed that September against the backdrop of a nationwide property slump. Six decades on however, Biba\u2019s legacy outlasts its footprint on the high street. Its low-cost yet well-made clothing is still coveted today, with heirloom designs sometimes retailing for hundreds of dollars. As Pel noted, \u201ctoday Biba clothes stand as a lesson to both consumers and retailers that inexpensive fashion does not have to be disposable.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/style/big-biba-london-1960s-store-history/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_style_spinel-tourmaline-gemstones", "text": "In 2016, jeweler Olivia Young of Ouroboros sold a red spinel ring for \u00a36,000 ($7,700). Last year, the client\u2019s insurance company paid out \u00a330,000 ($38,400) to replace it. Experts say that this previously overlooked gemstone is rocketing in desirability and value, as collectors look beyond the so-called \u201cBig Four\u2019\u201d (diamonds, emeralds, rubies and sapphires) for more affordable, niche gemstones that may just be a shrewd investment. Found in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Tajikistan and some African countries, spinels come in a range of colors, from vivid blue, pink and red to dusky grey, green and purple. Until they were properly identified in the 18th century, red spinels were called rubies; the 170-carat Black Prince\u2019s Ruby at the front of the Imperial State Crown, part of the British Crown Jewels, is in fact a spinel. In 2015, the auction house Bonhams sold the 50.13-carat Hope Spinel for a world-record \u00a3962,500 ($1.22m) \u2014 over six times its estimate \u2014 helping to catapult the stone into public consciousness. \u201cHistorically, spinels have been regarded as less important and therefore more affordable, but they are becoming increasingly desirable,\u201d said Jennifer Tonkin, Bonhams co-head of jewelry, over email. She noted that \u201cfire-engine red\u201d and hot-pink spinels from Burma, as well as rose-pink examples from Tajikistan, are most sought after by connoisseurs. Rahul Kadakia, international head of jewelry at Christie\u2019s, agreed that pink and purple spinels \u201cshould continue to see market appreciation,\u201d and shared that fine examples sell for up to $25,000 per carat. \u201cThe escalating prices of the \u201cbig four\u201d gems have compelled buyers to explore unconventional alternatives,\u201d he said in an email, but explained that appreciation of spinels\u2019 rich colors is no new phenomenon. \u201cThey were, after all, one of the favorite gems of Mughal rulers.\u201d A matter of ethics London-based jeweler Lily Gabriella features spinels in myriad shades in her one-off collectors\u2019 edition designs. She has seen a \u201cnotable increase\u201d in their price, reflecting \u201cboth their aesthetic appeal and their rarity\u201d she said via email, adding that spinels are \u201coften sourced from small-scale operations, presenting fewer ethical concerns compared to other stones.\u201d Charles Abouchar, director of Abouchar SA, a Geneva-based dealer who exhibits at the trade show Gem Gen\u00e8ve, said that rising demand for colored gemstones has led to a shortage of quality specimens, driving up prices. \u201cAs rubies, sapphires, and emeralds have become very expensive and scarce, people have begun buying other gemstones that were previously more affordable, causing prices to rise significantly,\u201d he said over email. \u201cSpinels and Paraiba tourmalines have seen a steady increase in demand over the last decade.\u201d Originally discovered in the 1980s in a now-exhausted mine in the Brazilian state of Paraiba, this once-niche variety of tourmaline is distinctive for its electric turquoise color, the result of traces of copper. Experts posit that only one Paraiba tourmaline is mined for every 10,000 diamonds \u2014 and while similar hues are found in Madagascar, the scarcity of Brazilian stones has seen prices soar. At Bonhams, Tonkin said prices for top-quality Paraiba tourmalines reached $75,000 per carat in 2022, compared with $4,800 per carat in 2009. Roberto Boghossian, Managing Partner of the jewelry house Boghossian, added that the price of Paraiba tourmalines has doubled in the last three to five years, which he attributes to their \u201crarity, beauty and enduring appeal,\u201d describing their neon glow as \u201ca refreshing alternative to more traditional gemstones.\u201d Moti Ferder, founder of Lugano Diamonds, began working with Paraiba tourmalines over 20 years ago. \u201cThere is an undeniable attraction to them \u2014 they are very rare and absolutely mesmerizing,\u201d he said in an email. Ferder foresees continued growth in value as demand increases and supply diminishes, \u201cmaking it one of the market\u2019s most coveted and prized gemstones.\u201d So, what if you\u2019re already priced out of the market for a Paraiba? Olivia Young is buying as much tourmaline from Afghanistan as she can, because these newer deposits offer \u201cincredibly beautiful bi-chrome material that\u2019s blue-green in one direction and grass-green at 90 degrees,\u201d describing them as \u201cthe most exquisite and vibrant gemstones I have ever seen.\u201d Likewise, gemmologist and founder of Minka Jewels Lucy Crowther counts blue-green tourmalines as the connoisseur\u2019s choice, having personally discovered them in India 15 years ago. \u201cThese incredibly vibrant, clean gemstones really stirred something in me,\u201d she explained\u00a0in an email. Now, she sources top-quality examples for unconventional engagement rings and colorful cocktail rings. \u201cWith lab-grown diamonds becoming increasingly popular, colored stones are a great choice for those wanting to stand out and have something natural that is also unique.\u201d Crowther and Young are both determined to educate clients that there\u2019s more to life than the Big Four. \u201cI believe across the board, that tourmalines of top-quality material and significant sizes will sky-rocket,\u201d said Young. \u201cThere is a finite amount of the incredible material and it is exceptionally beautiful, so I can only see its popularity exploding.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/style/spinel-tourmaline-gemstones/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_style_kinds-of-kindness-costumes", "text": "Yorgos Lanthimos \u2014 the movie director behind award season darlings \u201cThe Favourite\u201d and \u201cPoor Things\u201d \u2014 is hailed as a genius by fans of his often strange and unsettling oeuvre. He\u2019s made his name by courting the absurd and keeping audiences on their toes, embellishing his fables of love, power and free will with discordant musical motifs and disarming cuts to a wide lens. His latest project, \u201cKinds of Kindness,\u201d traces recognizable power dynamics \u2014 those with your boss, with your spouse or even with religious leaders \u2014 onto a surreal universe where they are intensified to their greatest (and often bloodiest) extremes. The film is told in three short stories. In the first, \u201cThe Death of R.M.F.,\u201d Jesse Plemons plays Robert, the hapless puppet of his boss Raymond (Willem Dafoe). In the second tale, \u201cR.M.F. is Flying,\u201d Plemons is a police officer whose wife (Emma Stone) has gone missing on a diving trip. When she returns, she seems fundamentally changed, prompting Plemons to test her love for him in progressively revolting ways. In the third instalment, \u201cR.M.F. Eats a Sandwich,\u201d Stone and a now-shaven headed Plemons are the disciples of a purity cult led by Dafoe, tasked with locating someone able to revive the dead. Although apparently detached from one another \u2014 bar the rotating cast and transient presence of the mysterious R.M.F. character (played by Yorgos Stefanakos) \u2014 each entry into the anthology repeats Lanthimos\u2019 career-spanning thesis: human agency is a myth, and people will commit unhinged acts to be accepted by the powerful. Happily, that dark existentialism didn\u2019t cloud the mood on set. \u201c(Lanthimos) puts together a group of really like-minded, lovely people that he feels will get along,\u201d Jennifer Johnson, the film\u2019s costume designer, told CNN via video call. \u201cWorking with Yorgos in general is a very satisfying, exhilarating and scary place, all at the same time. It\u2019s really fun!\u201d Power dressing \u201cKinds of Kindness\u201d is a film imbued with symbolism, and the costumes were critical in defining characters\u2019 relative status; in the first relationship we meet, Robert (Plemons) and Raymond (Dafoe) each wear their power quite literally on their sleeves. Raymond, dressed expensively in Italian suits, is \u201csomebody who has a lot of money, and exudes power and style but does it in his own way,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s this sense of confidence that was really important to telegraph very quickly, and this subtly eccentric way of dressing.\u201d His looks took inspiration from Gianni Agnelli, the head of Fiat between 1966 and 1996, who was a champion of Italy\u2019s nonchalantly chic \u201cSprezzatura\u201d style. \u201cHe would take hiking boots and wear them with a custom suit, with his watch worn on the outside of his shirt,\u201d Johnson recalled of Agnelli. \u201cIt\u2019s this mixing and matching that we take for granted now, but when (Agnelli) was dressing that was something that was very unusual.\u201d Per Raymond\u2019s written instructions \u2014 detailing not only how Robert should dress, but what he should read (always Tolstoy\u2019s \u201cAnna Karenina\u201d); what he should eat, and when he should have sex with his wife \u2014 Plemons is also immaculately suited, if self-consciously so. \u201c(Raymond) gives him things that would make most men really uncomfortable,\u201d Johnson said, pointing to a pink Tom Ford turtleneck Robert\u2019s made to wear. \u201cIt\u2019s (one of) the little signifiers of eccentric power play.\u201d Three stories, three looks Having crafted a visual language to reflect one power dynamic, the film\u2019s structure meant the same also had to be done for the second and third chapters. \u201cEach story plays for about an hour, so there\u2019s definitely enough character development within each one that it is a full movie. That was very difficult in our short production time,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWillem is such a great example: you are a CEO, and then you\u2019re (Stone\u2019s) father, and now you\u2019re a leader of a sex cult. To traverse that territory and walk all those distances in one (costume) fitting was a challenge, for sure.\u201d Most of the cast shoulder three characters each but, in the final chapter, Margaret Qualley had the additional task of playing identical twins Rebecca and Ruth. For Johnson, this required carving out clear character traits. \u201cWhat was nice is that one twin was really wild and had a punk rock spirit; you can imagine she\u2019s into indie music and is not really walking to a mainstream beat, whereas her twin sister is a veterinarian who is kind of bookish,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was important (the veterinarian) wore comfort shoes, so they were her Dansko clogs, and that she would have a darned sock; something that feels homemade. She likes pretty things, but she\u2019s not interested in fashion. You make these rules for each person.\u201d Dressing for laughs Despite the film\u2019s grim subject matter, there are unexpectedly comedic moments \u2014 not so much to offer respite but, if anything, to add to the jarring effect. Several of them rely on costuming to provide the visual gag \u2014 with Dafoe leading the charge. As Raymond, he stands up from the sofa after lambasting Robert to reveal a pair of exposed knees to the camera; a switch in tone sharp enough to pull roars of laughter from the audience in the movie theater. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of men in the world who can wear a knee-high sock and a white pleated short and look really gorgeous at the same time!\u201d Johnson joked. In the third chapter Dafoe plays a cult leader, freed from Raymond\u2019s designer suits and instead sporting little else besides eyeliner and orange Speedos. \u201cWillem is just one of the most lovely, delightful and intelligent collaborators you could ever ask for,\u201d Johnson beamed. \u201cHis physicality is so beautiful and lends itself to wearing clothing so well, so he can really go for it and wear the most absurd thing \u2014 but it\u2019s not wearing him; he\u2019s wearing it.\u201d The brightly-colored swimwear \u2014 a reflection of the cult\u2019s affinity for water \u2014 was a surprise pick for Dafoe, who made a beeline for it in the fitting room. \u201cBecause the cult is very sexual, I thought it would be great if we could get him in the least amount of clothes possible,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt was the first thing that he saw and he said \u2018yup, I\u2019m putting that on!\u2019. It was a very fun moment because we didn\u2019t tell Yorgos about it. (Dafoe) walked out for the camera test in it, and it definitely got a laugh!\u201d On their hunt for the elusive \u201cwaker of the dead,\u201d Stone and Plemons\u2019 outfits \u2014 earth-tone, loosely-fitted suits paired with sandals \u2014 are also laughably conspicuous. Johnson drew reference to \u201cThe X Files,\u201d but Ken and Barbie trying to blend in on Venice Beach also springs to mind. \u201cThey\u2019re like detectives, and they\u2019re cult members but they have to pretend to be normal,\u201d Johnson explained. \u201cI think those characters thought \u2018oh, well a suit makes us look normal,\u2019 when in actuality they look really weird and more scary; they would have been better off in their cult wear, which was just outdoor gear.\u201d Plemons\u2019 suit was one of two found in a gargantuan thrift store \u2014 \u201clike a whole city unto itself\u201d \u2014 in New Orleans, where the film was shot. \u201cIt\u2019s really fun when you find that; you can just imagine the gentleman who donated it,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt came in dark brown and tan, but the dark brown one never made it onto the camera.\u201d \u201cKinds of Kindness\u201d is an oddly-dressed, oddly-paced detour from a traditional blockbuster, but it does make a compelling argument for the collective, visceral experience of cinema. Over the course of an almost three-hour screening, Lanthimos\u2019 efforts provoked audible gasps, averted eyes and strangled groans. There was laughter: full-bodied at times, faltering at others, as viewers grappled with whether they were being entertained or horrified in real time. People recoiled. One person cried. As the credits rolled, a stunned silence fell over the room. The atmosphere had taken on its own heightened reality; complementary to Lanthimos\u2019 style, difficult to stop thinking about on the way home.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/style/kinds-of-kindness-costumes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}

Now, the King\u2019s very own blue suede shoes have sold for the princely sum of \u00a3120,000 (around $152,000) after they went up for grabs at British auction house Henry Aldridge and Son on Friday. Bidding for the shoes, which were described as \u201can iconic lot of showbusiness memorabilia that simply transcends 20th\u00a0century popular culture,\u201d began at \u00a355,000 (around $69,600). The shoes were bought by a client from California, Henry Aldridge and Son told CNN. The shoes, which are size 10 and a half and stamped with the \u201cNann-Bush\u201d brand, were worn by Presley both on and off stage during the 1950s, according to a description on the auction site. Presley wore the shoes while singing \u201cI Want You, I Need You, I Love You\u201d and \u201cHound Dog\u201d on \u201cThe Steve Allen Show\u201d in 1956, according to the auctioneer, and gave them to his friend Alan Fortas in 1958, the night before leaving for the US Army. The shoes have been authenticated by Jimmy Velvet, a close friend of Presley and the founder of the Elvis Presley Museum. The lot was accompanied by a letter of authenticity hand-signed by Velvet, as well as a letter by Fortas, which describes the events of the evening he was given the shoes. \u201cThe night before Elvis\u2019 army induction here in Memphis, Elvis had an all night party at Graceland,\u201d the letter says, according to the auction site. \u201cAfterwards we went to the Rainbow roller rink. When we all got home Elvis called some of us upstairs and was giving away some of his clothes he didn\u2019t think he would be wearing or wanted when he came back from the army.

Born and raised in Zimbabwe to an Indian family of shoemakers, he once became Harare\u2019s first importer of sex toys. After going on to make millions in private aviation (his planes have been used by celebrities, politicians and on \u201cKeeping Up With The Kardashians\u201d), he now spends most of his time in Dubai and London \u2014 which can present logistical challenges for driving his fleet of cars. \u201cI have a rare Porsche Carrera GT that cost me \u00a31.5m ($1.9m) and I keep it at the airport in Dubai,\u201d says Naran, whose company, Vimana Private Jets, also has offices in Los Angeles and New York. \u201cIf I fly anywhere, Emirates will put it on the earliest flight to wherever I\u2019m going so my car meets me there.\u201d Naran, who\u2019s 38, is one of thousands of wealthy car owners who think little of buying plane tickets for their automobiles, taking advantage of specialist freight services for cars that many of the major airlines offer, particularly those based in the Middle East. An ecosystem of car transport specialists has evolved to work with the airlines and the family offices of the ultra-rich so that favored vehicles magically follow them around the globe. It\u2019s traditionally a busy time of year for these services as the richest residents of the Gulf states prepare to jet off to cooler climes for the summer after Ramadan. The last time Naran flew his Porsche from Dubai to London on Emirates, he says it cost \u00a328,000 ($36,000) \u2014 a little more than he could have paid after landing for a brand-new Golf at a West London Volkswagen dealership. But then serious car guys tend not to want to be seen in family hatchbacks. \u201cI also have jet clients who are very wealthy and less price sensitive than me and don\u2019t want to put their cars on commercial airlines, in which case they\u2019ll charter a cargo plane from us, which costs in the millions,\u201d Naran tells me from Cape Town where\u2019s he\u2019s just arrived for a wedding, without the need for a car. The ultra-wealthy will often take whole fleets of cars with them when they travel, loading vehicles, along with motorbikes and other toys, onto chartered cargo aircraft that follow their private jets. Covered trucks are used to complete journeys to clients\u2019 addresses or garages; owners baulk at the idea of random delivery drivers adding mileage to their beloved cars. Naran says his richest clients barely blink at such excesses; one recently chartered a cargo plane to be ready to fly straight away when his newly acquired Samsung TV wouldn\u2019t fit through the door of his own jet. Rare cars can be worth millions, but not always. \u201cI have one client who transports a Nissan Patrol 4x4\u201d Naran says. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that it\u2019s worth anything, but he likes it and it\u2019s costing him millions to fly it around with his Bugatti.\u201d Dan Hallworth started shipping cars about 15 years ago after cutting his teeth at his uncle\u2019s freight firm in Manchester, England, after finishing school. Back then he says most of the business was in the summer and tended to involve cars coming from the Middle East to London. Newspapers used to be full of reports of hypercars roaring around chichi parts of the British capital at the hands of Qatari princes who cared little for speed limits or the parking fines they collected outside luxury department store Harrods. Hallworth, who says he can send a car between Dubai and London for around \u00a310,000 ($13,000) on cheaper airlines, says the market has changed since then. Police and councils in London started to clampdown on the showiest drivers, and viral videos of watch muggings and other crimes have put many of his clients off London. \u201cNow they go skiing and everything like that and it\u2019s much more all-year-round,\u201d says Hallworth, whose company, Dan Car Logistics, now ships more than 100 vehicles a year by air and thousands more by road. His clients are still mostly based in the Middle East and include royal families. He recently transported a \u201chumongous\u201d Mercedes to Los Angeles for \u00a320,000 ($25,000) and a \u00a312m ($15.3m) bespoke Bugatti Chiron Hermes edition to Marbella, Spain, for a Qatari prince. If anything, he says, the flow of wheels has reversed; he\u2019s often transporting cars from London to Dubai for people travelling or doing business there. It\u2019s a trend the airlines are noticing too; Etihad Cargo tells me the greatest demand for its FlightValet car shipping service is now in the UK. More than half of the 139 shipments of 151 cars it flew in 2023 originated from Heathrow, mostly bound for Abu Dhabi and Dubai. December was the busiest month, and the biggest destinations for cars leaving the UAE were Frankfurt, Zurich and Chicago. Etihad will only deal with registered freight agents rather than individuals \u2014 cars are considered to be \u201cdangerous goods\u201d and the paperwork required for them to clear customs can be extensive. Hallworth, who\u2019s 33, says an annual insurance policy covers all his work, the cost of which he includes in his fees. Occasionally he politely declines new customers if things seem, well, a little off. \u201cWe always want the owner\u2019s ID, the registration documents of the cars and to get a feel of the customer,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be just, like, \u2018yeah I can do that\u2019, and the next minute you\u2019ve got a stolen car on a plane and some serious questions to answer.\u201d Like Naran, who is now developing his own hypercar (the Naran will be yours for north of \u00a32m or $2.6m), Hallworth has grown his business thanks to word-of-mouth marketing at the highest levels. This can occasionally present him with tricky requests. \u201cI\u2019ve been asked to transport horses and camels,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not really my bag, and I would never say yes to a job if I\u2019m not 100% sure the cargo is going to be alive when it arrives.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/style/how-the-super-rich-ship-their-cars/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}

{"id": "style_article_sunil-gupta-india-gate-snap", "text": "To passersby, the sight of two men embracing besides New Delhi\u2019s India Gate in 1986 might have seemed unremarkable. In a city where public displays of platonic male affection are relatively commonplace, it was photographer Sunil Gupta who attracted more attention at the time. \u201cMen holding hands or lying in each other\u2019s laps is not an issue \u2014 it looks very romantic from (the outside), but they\u2019re usually just hanging out,\u201d he said in a video interview from the UK, before recalling: \u201cI was creating more interest than them, because I was standing there with a tripod and a camera, so everybody was focused on me.\u201d Onlookers may not have realized, but Gupta was creating a subtly subversive image in what he has described as the \u201crepressive atmosphere\u201d of 1980s India. At a time when homosexuality was more taboo in the country than it is today \u2014 and with consensual gay sex then criminalized as an \u201cunnatural offense\u201d \u2014 the photographer had found his subjects via the informal networks constituting Delhi\u2019s gay scene. The pair in question had chosen the war monument\u2019s gardens for their photo shoot due to its reputation as a cruising spot.  Having lived in New Delhi until his mid-teens, London-based Gupta knew this from personal experience. \u201cI passed that place on my way to school every day for 11 years,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just had to hop off the bus and get laid on your way home. It was very easy.\u201d The image forms part of the photographer\u2019s series \u201cExiles,\u201d which was first exhibited in the UK in 1987 but is this week showing at the India Art Fair in New Delhi. Primarily shot outdoors around India\u2019s capital, it captures gay men sat on benches or in public places popular among those looking for casual sexual partners, their faces often out of shot or turned away from the camera. Concerned about \u201couting\u201d his subjects, Gupta treated them as collaborators in what he called a \u201cconstructed documentary\u201d approach. After shooting his images and developing the film in London, he returned to Delhi with printed contact sheets to ensure the men were comfortable with the pictures he selected for his show. \u201cThere was quite a bit of horsing around in the pictures,\u201d he said of the India Gate shoot. \u201cAnd there were other photos that were (more suggestive)\u2026 So I picked a somewhat tamer one to put in the series.\u201d The other ethical challenge, he recalled, was communicating to the duo how the images would be used \u2014 and the art of photography itself. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t for publication, and the only way they saw pictures was in a magazine, so it took some explaining,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThen I tried to explain the process.\u201d Photography for many at the time, Gupta observed, was still \u201ca very mysterious thing that only a few people did in a darkroom.\u201d   For \u2018the canon\u2019  Now among India\u2019s most celebrated photographic artists, Gupta often addressed LGBTQ experiences in his explorations of race, immigration and identity. While studying in the US in the mid-1970s he produced a now-celebrated series of photos from New York\u2019s Christopher Street that captured the city\u2019s gay scene in the years between the Stonewall Riots and onset of the AIDS epidemic. Although \u201cExiles\u201d presented a rare portrait of gay life outside the West, Gupta\u2019s intended audience was always back in London. Homophobia was rife in 1980s Britain, and the photographer said he faced \u201ca lot of hostility\u201d at art school for making work relating to his sexuality. \u201cI couldn\u2019t make gay work, and I couldn\u2019t make gay work about India, especially,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was none in the library for reference. So, I thought, \u2018I\u2019m making it my mission to make some. Not for India, but for this canon \u2014 we need to have gay Indian guys in our library, in our art schools, over here.\u2019\u201d New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art has since acquired several of the pictures for its permanent collection, signifying the series\u2019 place in contemporary photography. But it was not an instant success. \u201cIt didn\u2019t have any impact when it was first shown,\u201d Gupta said of its debut.  \u201cI think it was too early.\u201d By the 1990s, however, interest in Gupta\u2019s work was growing, as art made by, and about, gay people of color became increasingly visible in the West. The fact that \u201cExiles\u201d is now showing in India, where he said it is positively received, is testament to changes on the subcontinent, too.  Although the country\u2019s LGBTQ communities still face significant social stigma, gay sex was decriminalized in 2018 and the arrival of apps like Grindr have been transformative, Gupta said. (\u201cThose sorts of chance meetings behind the bush are not happening \u2014 or maybe happening less,\u201d he added). This modern context and the power of hindsight have helped paint the photos in a new light. \u201cI think it has become historical enough that people are curious about what gay life was like before Grindr and the internet,\u201d Gupta said. \u201cPeople think it was all doom and gloom, and people jumping off buildings. They don\u2019t seem to appreciate that we also managed to have some kind of a life back then.\u201d This is a message reflected in the photographer\u2019s carefree India Gate shoot, which he recounts as a relaxed day of fun and abundant sunlight. \u201cIt just seemed very pleasurable. It was a nice day out, and I got to hang out with these guys who were having a good time and having a laugh.\u201d \u201cExiles\u201d is showing via Vadehra Art Gallery at India Art Fair, which runs February 9-12 in New Delhi, India. A book of outtakes from the series, published by Aperture, is available now.", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/article/sunil-gupta-india-gate-snap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_04_19_style_wash-day-photos-black-hair-tomesha-faxio", "text": "\u201cI was having wash day with my kids, and I was looking at their hair,\u201d the photographer Tomesha Faxio, a mother of two daughters, explained to CNN in a video call of her new monograph. \u201cI was just sitting in that moment, and it just dawned on me. Like, oh, wait a minute \u2014 this is it. I knew I wanted to showcase our hair in its natural state. I wanted to show the inherent beauty of Black natural hair.\u201d For Black women and children, wash day is equal parts essential maintenance and self-renewal. In my natural-haired family, our weekly or bi-weekly wash day starts with the gathering of the first set of tools; a wide-toothed comb, two body towels \u2014 one that can stand to get wet during the wash, another to wrap hair in afterwards \u2014 as well as shampoo, conditioner and deep conditioner. Once the two washes and conditionings have been completed in the kitchen sink, we head to the playroom, where we finger detangle with a product. Depending on if they\u2019re getting braids or not, my husband or I will blow dry our child\u2019s hair on low heat or let it air dry. (We don\u2019t typically do both of our kids\u2019 hair on the same day.) The process takes maybe three hours, but as a whole hinges on the styling that comes after the wash. This can also take hours, making it feel like every bit of a day. In the series of portraits that make up \u201cWash Day,\u201d Faxio sat with 26 families and took photos as they went through their distinct routines. Though each family had their own methods \u2014 and hair stories, which are shared in texts accompanying Faxio\u2019s photos \u2014 the cyclical nature of washings and styling has made the\u00a0day something that is universally understood, and appreciated, across Black communities. In her approach, Faxio took a pointed interest in hair as it was, versus how it was to become. \u201cI think that there\u2019s been beautiful work done on our hair portraiture and work that\u2019s been done with the hair styled in all these beautiful, intricate ways,\u201d she explained. \u201cBut I hadn\u2019t, at that time, seen a ton of work where the hair was just as is, and that\u2019s what I wanted to capture.\u201d The natural hair movement, with its first wave coming during the Black Is Beautiful era of the 1970s and the second during the digital revolution, has done their part in easing tensions around kinky, unprocessed hair, but old habits die hard. We talk often, after all, about the obsession with hair being \u201cdone\u201d and the intra-communal shame that sometimes comes with natural hair. Even as the Crown Act, a bill meant to stop hair-based discrimination, reverberates country-wide, the predisposition with how Black hair will be perceived \u2018on the job\u2019 \u2014 shorthand for by White observers \u2014 has fed into racist viewpoints and judgments on the acceptability of certain hairstyles. Faxio is hoping her book can further help foster conversations and encourage people to love their hair as it is. \u201cSo many of us have learned to accept ourselves more fully, and, in turn, are able to teach our children to do the same. We are now more informed about why we grew up thinking our hair was ugly\u2026 we can see that that these views are steeped in racism,\u201d she writes in the introduction to \u201cWash Day.\u201d \u201cWhile our children will likely continue to contend with non-inclusive beauty standards, we are putting them in a better position to understand and eradicate them.\u201d Speaking with Faxio, and engaging with her photobook, reminds me of my own childhood wash days. I had a head full of black, thick hair. Keeping me calm during washings was a task; I was afraid of water and recoiled at the idea of each session, let alone the actual practice. One weekend \u2014 my wash days were always on weekends \u2014 my mother needed support. She trotted upstairs to a cousin\u2019s apartment, hoping the elders there would help soothe my fears and step in so she wouldn\u2019t have to do it alone. (She was tired of doing things alone.) There, Mom walked me to the sink, turned the warm water on and started lathering. My aunt and grandmother took turns. I nearly soaked a towel while trying to keep the water from touching my face, but through the fear, I felt cared for. \u201cCalm down. Brooklyn, what if you turn around so your head is facing upward? Right, like that.\u201d  Twenty-five years later, I have a daughter of my own. For us too,\u00a0wash day is a high energy sport \u2014 and it\u2019s also a bonding exercise that neither of us will forget. Therein lies the beauty of the experience. \u201cI learned so much from these moms,\u201d Faxio said. \u201cThe greatest thing for me is a renewed love for wash day and renewed sense of value in the process.\u201d Before she set out to write \u201cWash Day,\u201d she\u2019d try to push back her daughters\u2019 washes because she knew that when it was all said and done, her arms would be sore and she\u2019d want to just melt in bed. Now, though, she welcomes the experience. \u201cIt\u2019s work. But spending time with these moms and thinking about how we are able to pass on love of our hair \u2014 an inheritance of pride and joy in our hair, to our kids,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt just renewed my love for the process.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/19/style/wash-day-photos-black-hair-tomesha-faxio/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_style_cambodia-statue-repatriation-met-museum", "text": "The return to Cambodia this week of 14 sculptures looted from the country during a period of war and unrest is like welcoming home the souls of ancestors, Cambodia\u2019s culture minister, Phoeurng Sackona, said Thursday. The items repatriated from New York\u2019s\u00a0Metropolitan Museum of Art arrived Wednesday and were displayed to journalists and VIPs on Thursday at the National Museum in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh. They \u201cwere made between the 9th and 14th centuries in the Angkorian period and reflect the Hindu and Buddhist religious systems prevailing at that time,\u201d the museum said in a statement. A statement from Cambodia\u2019s Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts said the \u201chistoric homecoming of national treasures\u201d followed several years of negotiations between Cambodia\u2019s art restitution team, United States federal prosecutors in New York, investigators from the US Department of Homeland Security and the Metropolitan Museum. The culture minister added that the return of the artifacts was very important to the Cambodian people for recalling the heritage of their ancestors through good times and bad. \u201cThe pieces were staying a long, long time abroad, but today they returned to Cambodia, like a blessing for our people for peace, stability in our country now,\u201d said Sackona, adding that to Cambodians, the returned artworks carry with them the souls of their ancestors. Bringing back the souls of ancestors also includes bringing history, admiration and knowledge, she explained, noting that Cambodia hopes to soon receive another 50 artifacts from the US. Cambodia claims that other items illegally trafficked from the country are still at the Metropolitan Museum, as well as at other museums and in the hands of private collectors. \u201cThese returns contribute to the reconciliation and healing of the Cambodian people, who endured decades of civil war and suffered tremendously from the tragedy of the Khmer Rouge regime,\u201d Sackona said. \u201cThey also demonstrate the truly positive partnership we have developed with the United States.\u201d For the art world, their return is the fruit of a reckoning in recent years over art and archaeological treasures taken from their homelands. These include not only ancient Asian artworks, but also pieces lost or stolen during turmoil in other places, such as Syria, Iraq and Nazi-occupied Europe. The pieces returned to Cambodia from the Met were looted during a long period of civil war and instability in Cambodia, which was ruled by the brutal communist\u00a0Khmer Rouge regime\u00a0in the 1970s. They were bought and trafficked by well-known art dealer Douglas Latchford, who was indicted in 2019 for allegedly orchestrating a multiyear scheme to sell looted Cambodian antiquities on the international art market. Latchford, who died the following year, had denied any involvement in smuggling. Cambodia\u2019s Culture Ministry highlighted two works among those returned that are expected to be restored by reuniting them with other parts already in their possession. The repatriation includes the \u201cextraordinary\u201d stone sculpture from the 10th century of the female goddess Uma from the ancient royal capital of Koh Ker, it said, adding that the sculpture\u2019s foot had already been retrieved from its original site. \u201cAt last, the Uma can be reunified to achieve its full magnificence as one complete statue,\u201d it said. \u201cMoreover, a significant returned artifact is a 10th century bronze head of the deity Avalokiteshvara, which the Ministry highly anticipates finally being reunited with its matching torso, currently on display at the National Museum of Cambodia.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/style/cambodia-statue-repatriation-met-museum/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_style_new-miss-usa-crowned-hawaii-savannah-gankiewicz", "text": "Amid a dramatic two weeks of resignations and allegations made against the Miss USA organization, Miss Hawaii USA Savannah Gankiewicz \u2014 who had originally placed as the first runner-up at the 2023 Miss USA pageant \u2014 has stepped up to be crowned Miss USA. \u201cWhile this decision was not made lightly, I firmly believe that this opportunity was meant for me and I am ready to make a positive impact with this organization that I hold dear to my heart,\u201d said the 28-year-old, who was crowned by the governor of Hawaii Josh Green at a ceremony in Honolulu, Hawaii, on Wednesday. \u201cI am dedicated to taking action and making a difference. With my background as a certified mental health first aid responder and training in anti-bullying suicide prevention. I understand, the importance of prioritizing your well-being and advocating for those in need. I believe that the true change starts from within and I am determined to lead by example and empower the class of 2024 and beyond,\u201d she said, addressing a crowd in a hotel in Waikiki, a small aquarium in the background. Gankiewicz has taken over the title from Noelia Voigt, who suddenly gave up her crown earlier this month. Voigt cited her mental health as her reason for stepping down, but her resignation letter to the Miss Universe organization,\u00a0obtained\u00a0by CNN, accused CEO Laylah Rose, of \u201cactively building a culture of fear and control.\u201d Among her claims, she wrote that Miss USA management often failed to provide her with travel accommodations or an \u201ceffective handler,\u201d the latter leading to an instance where Voigt says she was sexually harassed during a Christmas parade in Sarasota, Florida, while alone with an unnamed person in a car. The Miss Universe organization and Rose, through Miss USA, did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Two days after Voigt\u2019s resignation, Miss Teen USA 2023 UmaSofia Srivastava relinquished her title as well, writing on Instagram that her values \u201cno longer fully align with the direction of the organization.\u201d In her first official appearance since the controversy, Rose did not address any of the allegations. She welcomed Gankiewicz to the Miss USA family telling her to \u201cembrace this moment of influence and let your words carry the power of positive change,\u201d and thanked her corporate partners and sponsors for their \u201cunwavering support.\u201d Rose said that this year\u2019s Miss Teen USA and Miss USA pageants would take place in Los Angeles and would broadcast on the CW network. The CW announced a multi-year agreement to air the two pageants in April, but in light of recent allegations, USA Today reported Monday that the network was \u201cevaluating\u201d its relationship with the Miss USA organization. The CW did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Tumult and turnover Currently, the Miss Teen USA role remains unfilled. The first runner-up from 2023, New York\u2019s Stephanie Skinner, declined to be crowned in a public statement on Instagram. On Tuesday, Voigt and Srivastava\u2019s mothers spoke out on \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d saying their daughters remained under strict non-disclosure agreements in their contracts and could not talk about their experiences. \u201cThe job of their dreams turned out to be a nightmare,\u201d Barbara Srivastava said. \u201cThe girls decided to step down and give (up) their dream of a lifetime \u2014 a crown, a national title. Why would two girls decide to give that up?\u201d During their reigning year, she added, their daughters were \u201cill-treated, abused, bullied and cornered,\u201d she added. Miss USA and Miss Universe Organization have not returned CNN\u2019s multiple requests for comment. Though many current Miss USA state titleholders expressed their public support on Instagram following Voigt\u2019s resignation, this week, the reigning Miss Colorado USA, Arianna Lemus, gave up her title completely. \u201cMy values were compromised. Silencing women is not the definition of pageantry,\u201d she told CNN on Wednesday. \u201cAs a collective, the 2023 (Miss USA) class came together in solidarity with Noelia, but that wasn\u2019t enough for me\u2026 and that\u2019s why I resigned.\u201d Gankiewicz will only hold the Miss USA title for a few months this summer, until a new contestant from the 2024 class of state titleholders takes the national crown in August at the next Miss USA pageant. On Instagram, she had acknowledged the limitations of her role, saying, \u201cWith the little time I have as Miss USA, it is my intention to bring attention and focus onto the rebuilding of Lahaina on my island of Maui. I also look forward to helping the 2024 delegates transition into a new era of Miss USA and supporting them on their own journeys towards the crown.\u201d Lemus, meanwhile, called on urgent action to protect 2024 titleholders and beyond from restrictive contracts. Voigt\u2019s mother, Jackeline Voigt, said on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d that contestants should reconsider competing at all. \u201cLook at what happened to Noelia and UmaSofia,\u201d she said. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s not the right time to participate.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/style/new-miss-usa-crowned-hawaii-savannah-gankiewicz/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "style_article_moshe-safdie-architect-singapore", "text": "There are few buildings that have more drastically shaped a city\u2019s image than Marina Bay Sands. Just as the Eiffel Tower and Burj Khalifa define the skylines of Paris and Dubai, the soaring three-tower resort, joined across the top by a horizontal \u201cskypark\u201d and the world\u2019s most famous infinity pool, is an icon both in and of Singapore. In fact, the hotel-casino project is so successful that the man who designed it doesn\u2019t even stay there. \u201cIt\u2019s too noisy,\u201d said Israeli-Canadian architect Moshe Safdie. \u201cI\u2019m a swimmer and I can never get in the pool because there are so many people taking pictures.\u201d Now resuming his once-frequent trips to Singapore amid easing travel restrictions, Safdie prefers the nearby Ritz-Carlton, where we meet for afternoon tea. (\u201cI had a British mother,\u201d he explained, \u201cso I\u2019m a sucker for scones and tea.\u201d) At a top-floor table overlooking his best-known creation, he reflected on the sometimes-fraught task of designing contemporary landmarks. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t on my mind as much as it was on their minds,\u201d he clarified, recounting the call for design proposals issued by the city-state\u2019s government in the mid-2000s. \u201cThey didn\u2019t quite say the building should become the icon of Singapore, but they talked about it being iconic.  \u201cWhen we made the submission, I said, \u2018Some buildings have the magic to become memorable and associated with a place.\u2019 And I mentioned Sydney Opera House as the classic contemporary example. But, I said, \u2018It\u2019s a mystery what makes that happen.\u2019\u201d The trick, it transpired, was designing something striking yet simple. Constructing a 0.2-mile-long cantilevered roof terrace atop three skyscrapers required a feat of complex engineering but, at its most abstract, Marina Bay Sands can be sketched in four basic strokes. In Singapore Sign Language, the landmark is referenced by simply raising three fingers of one hand and resting another digit across the top. Visible for miles around, it appears on postcards and newscast backdrops. The structure also stars in the official Singapore Lego set, which the architect proudly displays at his office back in Somerville, Massachusetts.  \u201cThat kind of stuff, you can\u2019t quite plan for or design \u2013 it just happens,\u201d he said of the building\u2019s success. \u201cBut I\u2019m very happy about it. It changed our lives in terms of the work we get.\u201d  Safdie\u2019s eponymous firm is in high demand. In the years since Marina Bay Sands opened in 2010, he has realized almost 20 major projects. Among them are the serene Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas and a dual-tower residential complex in Colombo, Sri Lanka, that sees one high-rise lean dramatically against the other. The architect also bequeathed Singapore with another landmark in 2019: Jewel, a nature-themed entertainment and retail complex that attracts throngs of Instagrammers to Changi Airport each day thanks to its verdant indoor waterfall.  Safdie has said he considers seeing finished projects in use to be among an architect\u2019s greatest pleasures. He makes a point of visiting Jewel whenever he\u2019s in Singapore. \u201cI was concerned about how the plants were doing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I was relieved to see they\u2019re thriving.\u201d The architect is not in Singapore to indulge in past glories, however. In the days after our interview, he will inspect two new developments: a gardenesque office complex in the island\u2019s west and a pair of residential towers on the upmarket Orchard Road. The latter features multiple skybridges \u2013 a recurring theme in Safdie\u2019s work that was recently taken to new extremes in Chongqing, China, where he lay a gargantuan \u201chorizontal skyscraper\u201d (containing an infinity pool, restaurants and an indoor garden) atop four 820-foot-tall towers.   Then there is the small matter of Marina Bay Sands\u2019 second phase. The expansion plans feature, among other things, a fourth tower \u2013 though Safdie dismissed early suggestions that his iconic skypark might be extended to rest across its top. In any case, Singapore officials have expressed that he shouldn\u2019t, in his words, \u201cscrew around\u201d with an icon. Instead, the new tower will stand apart from the other three, forming \u201csort of an exclamation mark,\u201d he explained, motioning punctuative strokes: \u201cBoooom\u2026 boom.\u201d  Radical vision  At 84, Safdie shows little sign of slowing down. Other recent trips have taken him to Sao Paolo, Brazil, where his glass-roofed Albert Einstein Education and Research Center recently opened its doors, and to the Ecuadorian capital Quito, where his tree-covered Qorner Tower will do so later this year. Covid-19 eased the architect\u2019s unrelenting travel schedule, but he used the downtime to pen a memoir, \u201cIf Walls Could Speak: My Life in Architecture.\u201d He said he felt it was \u201ctime to document things.\u201d  Published this week, \u201cIf Walls Could Speak\u201d serves as a reminder that much of Safdie\u2019s six-decade career has been dedicated to humbler pursuits \u2013 museums, memorials and social housing that reimagined how people might live in densely populated cities.  Before Marina Bay Sands, his best-known project was his very first: Habitat 67, a radical 1960s housing development that saw hundreds of identical prefabricated concrete units stacked into clusters along Montreal\u2019s Saint Lawrence River. Safdie\u2019s dream that it would spark a wave of large-scale \u201cHabitats\u201d around the world proved overly optimistic. His attempts to repeat the feat in other cities, including New York, Toronto and Iran\u2019s capital Tehran, have often been thwarted. Projects of such size require land, funding and political will, and Safdie\u2019s book openly recounts times when all three were lacking. But the principles underpinning the experiment \u2013 that apartment dwellers should enjoy access to outdoor space, views in multiple directions and the opportunity to interact with nature and neighbors \u2013 defined his work thereafter. Born in 1938 in Haifa, then part of British-controlled Palestine, Safdie has credited much of this architectural ethos to his childhood. As a boy, he always lived in apartment buildings, first in a Bauhaus-style block on Haifa\u2019s Mount Carmel and then at his family\u2019s new home further up the hill. At the latter, he would enter via a bridge, while the famous Baha\u2019i Gardens \u201calmost functioned as my backyard,\u201d he writes in \u201cIf Walls Could Speak.\u201d One need not look far for the inspiration behind the skybridges and elevated urban gardens that have since characterized his oeuvre. Safdie moved to Canada with his parents aged 15. (In a neat turn of events, he departed Israel via Lod Airport, since renamed Ben Gurion Airport, where decades later he would design a terminal building.) It was in Montreal that Safdie decided to pursue architecture \u2013 and where he first grew his signature mustache. He attended the city\u2019s McGill University and wrote a college thesis, \u201cA Case for City Living,\u201d outlining his vision for a flexible housing \u201csystem\u201d that could be adapted to different contexts and climates. Those early ideas have long shaped Safdie\u2019s outlook. They would shape his fortunes, too. After showing his college drawings to the influential modernist Louis Kahn, he secured an apprenticeship at the architect\u2019s Philadelphia office. Soon after, he was offered the chance to put his ideas into practice at a scale unimaginable to most young graduates.  Montreal was due to host the 1967 World Fair, or Expo 67. Despite having never completed a building, the then 24-year-old Safdie was asked by the event\u2019s mastermind (and his thesis adviser), architect Sandy van Ginkel, to develop a master plan for the site. He was also tasked with building on his ideas, eventually proposing a village-sized development of some 1,200 prefabricated dwellings stacked 20 to 30 stories high. His meticulous placement of each factory-built module was calculated to maximize garden space, allow in sunlight and improve residents\u2019 views. Interconnected pedestrian walkways and bridges lifted the urban realm above ground.  Political and financial realities scaled back his design; the final Habitat 67 comprised just 154 apartments \u2013 made from 354 modules and stacked 12 stories high across three \u201cclusters.\u201d It was, nonetheless, a major statement. In a postwar world rethinking how to accommodate rapidly urbanizing populations, Safdie\u2019s system of repeated modular forms offered a bold new model for housing. Three of the 20th century\u2019s most important architects, I.M. Pei, Paul Rudolph and Philip Johnson, toured the project together prior to its opening. Only when Johnson told Safdie that he had \u201coutdone\u201d the classical Italian architect Giovanni Battista Piranesi did he realize the project \u201cwas a game changer,\u201d he recounted. Habitat 67 was not universally adored. A New Yorker cartoon, which Safdie also displays at his Boston office, poked \u201cgentle fun\u201d at the project by depicting a spade-wielding child stacking sand into similar formations. Various journalists and fellow architects were more barbed in their criticisms.  \u201cIt\u2019s strange that something so radical done by a young person gets so much crap thrown at it,\u201d Safdie mused. \u201cBut that\u2019s been true of my career.\u201d   \u2018For everyone a garden\u2019  To define Safdie\u2019s career by either his breakout success or the \u201cmegascale\u201d projects of recent years would be to ignore much else in between.  In the early 1970s, he opened an office in Jerusalem, a city whose urban fabric he has profoundly transformed. As well as designing major institutions like the Hebrew Union College and the Yad Vashem Holocaust History Museum, he oversaw a full-scale rebuild of the destroyed Jewish Quarter and planned an entirely new city, Modi\u2019in-Maccabim-Re\u2019ut, about 15 miles to its northwest. At one point, he even considered running for mayor of Jerusalem. He has also built widely in North America, where his output spans from the meditative (a nondenominational chapel at the Harvard Business School) to the mammoth (Terminal 1 of Toronto\u2019s Pearson Airport). A citizen of Israel, the US and Canada, Safdie may be best known in the latter for the National Gallery in Ottawa, a grand glass palace housing some of the country\u2019s most treasured art.  Despite earlier setbacks Safdie has, more recently, found fertile ground for his \u201cHabitats\u201d in Asia. In 2017, he completed the first phase of the sprawling Habitat Qinhuangdao \u2013 in the titular city, about 200 miles from Beijing \u2013 a series of 16-story \u201cmini blocks\u201d connected by garden bridges. Back in Singapore, Safdie\u2019s pixelated Sky Habitat tower saw him stretch his familiar stacked forms high above the ground to maximize floor space on a comparatively small plot. In both cases \u2013 and throughout Safdie\u2019s career \u2013 ideals articulated in the 1960s have been adapted to meet the realities of new sites and clients. Yet, the architect maintains that his approach to housing remains, fundamentally, the same. \u201cThe belief in apartments being rethought as houses, in having gardens for every apartment, in quality of life, in streets and communities and making buildings that belong to their culture \u2013 from the outset these were fundamental to my beliefs,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they haven\u2019t changed. If anything, they have reinforced themselves as years go by.\u201d \u201cI think, without bragging, there\u2019s been consistency,\u201d he added. \u201cIn fact, you could say I\u2019ve not been dynamic enough, but I\u2019ve been pretty consistent.\u201d  Idealism and compromise   There were other high-profile proposals that never came to fruition. Among the most divisive was the Columbus Center, a pair of heavy-set towers once set to loom over Manhattan\u2019s Central Park at Columbus Circle before plans were scrapped following 1987\u2019s Wall Street crash (and amid vociferous criticism from the likes of Henry Kissinger and Jacqueline Onassis).  But Safdie\u2019s legacy will not be measured only by what was, or wasn\u2019t, built. Many of the once-radical ideas he championed are now mainstream \u2013 something he can take an amount of credit for. For one, his fixation on plant life, a principle he dubbed \u201cfor everyone a garden\u201d in a 1974 book of the same name, is now widely shared by younger architects. Urban gardens and \u201cliving walls\u201d are now almost de rigueur for new large-scale developments.  Plants do not always thrive, though. In his memoir, Safdie distinguishes between \u201csignificant plant life\u201d and \u201csorry shrubs.\u201d So-called biophilic architecture may now be all the rage, but it can be undone by insufficient planning or maintenance, leaving occupants with dying trees and even bug infestations. As such, Safdie welcomes the trend while cautioning again token gestures. \u201cThe idea of green buildings is a battle cry \u2013 everyone is for it,\u201d he said. Making them work, however, is another matter altogether. \u201cThere\u2019s a cynicism about so many architects presenting buildings that are fairly conventional and then, in the renderings, everything is green and every balcony is oozing with trees. When you look (closer), you see there\u2019s no preparation for the earth, there\u2019s no depth \u2013 it\u2019s a fantasy.\u201d Prefabrication, championed by the architect since his college thesis, is also enjoying a renaissance. Just two miles away from Marina Bay Sands, for instance, a Singaporean design firm is overseeing two 630-foot-tall residential skyscrapers built from units constructed in a factory over the border in Malaysia.  \u201cFor a long time, people totally gave up on (prefabrication),\u201d Safdie said. \u201cBut now there is a real shortage of labor and skilled labor \u2013 not in China, because they\u2019ve got an extraordinary workforce, and not in India, but everywhere else in Southeast Asia, in Singapore, in the West. So, anything that is labor-saving is now up for grabs.\u201d Much else has changed since Safdie formed his architectural ideals. For one, he \u201cnever would have imagined\u201d how densely populated cities would become in the past 50 years. \u201cPrograms change, lifestyles change, priorities change and technologies change,\u201d the architect added.  But what about him? Has his outlook changed, too? \u201cMy daughter accused me of not being as idealistic as I was,\u201d the architect said. \u201cI disagree with her.\u201d Safdie is nonetheless aware that the lofty principles of his youth may not be shared by the casinos or corporate clients he often works for. Being an architect sometimes means serving \u201cregimes you\u2019re not in love with and business entities whose values are different to yours,\u201d he noted.  \u201cTake the dilemma I had with Marina Bay Sands,\u201d he said, motioning once more toward the window and our view of the complex from the Ritz-Carlton\u2019s lounge. \u201cOn the one hand, the idea of doing a building that could promote \u2018gaming\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s a nice word for it, but \u2018gambling\u2019 is the reality \u2013 is almost immoral if you go there and see poor people with limited means wasting their money.  \u201cBut, to me, that was 2% or 3% of the area of a project that\u2026 could show what the public realm could be in a city. And that took over from the issue that nagged me.  \u201cThat\u2019s compromise,\u201d he concluded. \u201cBut the basic value, the idealism of the end product, has not diminished. Without it, I don\u2019t know how you can be an architect.\u201d \u201cIf Walls Could Speak: My Life in Architecture,\u201d published by Grove Atlantic, is available now.", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/article/moshe-safdie-architect-singapore/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "style"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_style_fumihiko-maki-architect-dies", "text": "Tokyo (AP) \u2014 Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for designs praised as smartly and artfully fusing the East with the West, has died. He was 95. Maki, who taught architecture and urban design at Harvard, died June 6, his office, Maki & Associates, said Wednesday. Japanese media reports attributed the cause of death to old age. The office declined to confirm the reports. The National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto is considered one of his classic designs, with floating forms of glass, metal and concrete. Its gray exterior appears simple at first glance but sets off patterns of reflected light on rough and polished marble. In the U.S., Maki\u2019s projects included the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and 4 World Trade Center in New York. He also did the Makuhari Messe exhibition hall in Chiba, Japan, and the Hillside Terrace Complex in Tokyo. Maki in the 1980s designed Tokyo\u2019s Spiral building, whose management mourned his death and thanked him for \u201cthe beautiful slopes and the rich space that envisioned an urban park.\u201d In 2013, Maki\u00a0complained about the then planned spaceship-like design\u00a0of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics stadium, slamming it as too expensive and clashing with its surroundings. He said he had the support 100 other people, including architects, in opposing the size of the proposed design by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. \u201cThe problems I see with the planned stadium all relate to the issue of scale,\u201d he said.That design was eventually ditched for a more modest-looking design by\u00a0Kengo Kuma\u00a0which used pieces of wood for a natural Japanese look. Born in Tokyo in 1928, Maki was educated at the University of Tokyo, the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Before opening his own design firm in 1965 in Tokyo, he worked in various offices including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, or SOM, based in Chicago, and Sert, Jackson & Associates in Cambridge, as well as the campus planning office of Washington University in St. Louis. A devoted educator, Maki, in addition to teaching at Washington University, Harvard and the University of Tokyo, lectured around the world. His essays were published in a collection called \u201cNurturing Dreams\u201d by MIT Press in 2008. In it, he explored the Japanese sense of space called \u201coku,\u201d which Maki described as \u201cthe core of this high-density space organized into multiple layers like an onion.\u201d Utilizing oku allowed the Japanese to deliver a feeling of depth even in a cramped area, according to this theory. \u201cIn the formation of urban space, certain stable concepts that have been sifted and committed to memory by the collective unconscious of the community work automatically,\u201d Maki wrote. \u201cOku, a spatial concept peculiar to Japan, is a good example, and I believe an understanding of this way of perceiving space is important in formulating ideas of what future cities should be like.\u201d Maki was the second Japanese to win the Pritzker, hailed as the Nobel Prize of architecture, after Kenzo Tange, his mentor. Maki, along with fellow Tange students\u00a0Arata Isozaki\u00a0and\u00a0Kisho Kurokawa, were the pillars of Japanese modernism. The Pritzker, in selecting Maki, praised him as part of a new wave of architects rebuilding postwar Japan. \u201cHe uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of every design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony. He uses detail to give his structures rhythm and scale,\u201d Bill Lacy, a member of the international panel of jurors that selected Maki, said at the time. Maki was honored with other awards, such as the Wolf Prize from Israel in 1988 and the Arnold Brunner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1999. In 2011, the American Institute of Architects honored Maki with its highest accolade, the AIA Gold Medal. Japanese media reports said a memorial service was planned.

{"id": "2024_06_25_style_paris-2024-olympic-village", "text": "When Paris last hosted the Summer Olympics 100 years ago, organizers were so keen to bring athletes under the same roof that they built the first-ever Olympic Village. It was spartan, made up of furnished wood huts, and it was razed shortly after. The competition is back in the City of Lights a century later, but French officials are doing something completely different this time around. As part of their effort to make Paris 2024 the \u201cmost responsible and sustainable games in history,\u201d they\u2019re building something that\u2019s meant to last. \u201cThis village was thought up as a neighborhood, a neighborhood that is going to have a life afterwards,\u201d said Georgina Grenon, the Paris 2024 director of sustainability. \u201cParis 2024 is renting it for a few months.\u201d Instead of rooming in apartments tailor-made for them, athletes in the Olympic Village this summer will be living in what will become someone else\u2019s home or workplace. Once the Paralympics have finished on September 8, the village \u2014 which contains 82 buildings \u2014 will be converted into office space for 6,000 workers and apartments to house another 6,000 people. The hope is that the project will provide a model to alleviate a housing crisis in the French capital, where rising interest rates, surging prices and a supply crunch have made it harder than ever to buy or rent a home. Demand for affordable housing is so intense that when a small 10 square meter (108 square feet) apartment in Paris\u2019 up-and-coming 10th arrondissement hit the rental market last year at a price of 610 euros ($614) per month, it attracted a staggering 765 applicants in less than a week. The site for the Olympic Village was chosen in the hopes it would revitalize some of the city\u2019s historically impoverished northern suburbs. The village lies at the juncture of three suburbs: Saint-Denis, a diverse, working-class neighborhood long associated with crime and insecurity; the rapidly gentrifying Saint-Ouen; and Ile-Saint-Denis, an island on the Seine River. Organizers say post-Olympics, 32% of the new homes in Saint-Denis and Saint-Ouen, and 48% of those in Ile-Saint-Denis built for the Games will be set aside for public housing. There\u2019s a risk, however, that current residents could be priced out. Similar pledges to build affordable housing in east London were made in advance of the 2012 Olympics, but those promises ended up largely falling flat. A BBC report in 2022 found that of the 9,000 homes built within the Olympic Park, less than 200 were offered at the cheapest levels of rent. \u2018It\u2019s a huge test lab\u2019 Like the Olympics themselves \u2014 which organizers say will run 100% on renewable energy \u2014 everything built for the village was done with sustainability in mind. To minimize the amount of construction, organizers temporarily or permanently retrofitted several existing structures on the site, including an old electric factory that\u2019s been turned into a \u201cresident center.\u201d They also rented existing movie studios in the area to be used as training facilities for athletes instead of building new training facilities which has been done at some other Games. The buildings that were erected were built with wood and recycled materials, employing processes that, according to Grenon, reduced the project\u2019s carbon footprint by 30% per square meter \u2014 more than French ecological regulations require. A third of all the rooftops are equipped with solar panels, while another third have gardens meant to bring down the temperature inside, Grenon said. And long, straight openings leading to the Seine were left in between the buildings to form wind tunnels carrying the fresh air near the river as far inland as possible. Temperatures this summer are expected to be warmer than normal, according to France\u2019s national weather service, and there is widespread concern heat could jeopardize athlete safety. But the structures themselves aren\u2019t the only thing that will be recycled. The village will house about 3,000 apartments containing a total of 14,250 beds made with recyclable materials similar to the ones used in Tokyo. The mattresses were manufactured with reused materials and their firmness can be adjusted by flipping them over. Stools were made with cardboard meaning they can be easily recycled after the Olympics. Across the village, organizers are running a handful of experiments to see if new green technologies and construction methods are viable in the real world. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge test lab,\u201d Grenon said. One sidewalk has been made with seashells. In theory, those shells are supposed to absorb rain. On hot days, the stored water should evaporate and help cool passers-by. The village\u2019s main drag features five experimental outdoor air filters. These giant, UFO-like towers are designed like vacuums to suck in the polluted air and filter out dangerous particles. The device can clean \u201c95% of the air of the particulate matter \u2014 all sizes,\u201d its creator, Jerome Giacomoni, told CNN. The five devices can clean the equivalent of the volume of 40 Olympic-sized swimming pools an hour with very little electricity consumption, Giacomoni said. Keeping cool The most scrutinized innovation will likely be the geothermal cooling system, as athletes in Paris could face the same level of sweltering heat and humidity that broiled Tokyo during the Summer Olympics there three years ago. \u201cClimate change should increasingly be viewed as an existential threat to sport,\u201d Sebastian Coe, the president of World Athletics, said in a report published last week (June 18) examining the heat risks associated with this summer\u2019s games. While the ground floor of some buildings in the Olympic Village are equipped with traditional air conditioning because they will be converted into shops after the Olympics, the athlete apartments will use geothermal cooling instead of air conditioning. This system takes water cooled to 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit) from wells as deep as 70 meters (230 feet) underground at a nearby geothermal plant and transports them to pipes under the floors of each apartment. That cold water should be able to cool the building by 6 to 10 degrees Celsius compared to the temperature outside, according to Laurent Michaud, the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Village director. While the system will be controlled at the building level, each apartment has a thermostat that allows them to lower or raise the temperature by 2 degrees Celsius in each unit. The system will also heat apartments in the winter. The human-caused climate crisis has made heat waves more frequent and intense, and they are starting earlier in the year in many parts of the world. Paris is particularly vulnerable \u2014 people in the French capital are more likely to die from extreme heat than any other city in Europe, a study that looked at more than 850 cities showed. As of 2022, just 19% of all households in Europe were equipped with air conditioning, according to the most recent figures from the International Energy Agency. But extreme heat across the world has driven up global demand for AC units, creating a climate Catch-22, as air conditioning systems use large amounts of energy, much of which still comes from fossil fuels that emit carbon dioxide and heats the planet. For delegations concerned about the system\u2019s efficacy during a heat wave, the village will offer them the option to rent individual air conditioning units. Asked about the lack of air conditioning in the Village by news agency Reuters in March, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said the village was \u201cdesigned to avoid the need for air conditioning, even in very, very high temperatures.\u201d \u201cWe are on the brink of a precipice.
