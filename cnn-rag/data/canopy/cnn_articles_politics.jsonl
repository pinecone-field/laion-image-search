{"id": "2024_07_17_politics_jd-vance-rnc-speech", "text": "A faint burst of applause broke out from the Republican National Convention floor as Sen. JD Vance took the stage Tuesday afternoon in Milwaukee for the first time as Donald Trump\u2019s running mate. The Gettysburg Address was loaded into the teleprompters, adjusted for Vance\u2019s towering frame. Arms crossed over a navy suit and gold tie \u2013 an Ohio State man dangerously close to sporting Michigan colors \u2013 Vance looked out during his midday walkthrough, a hint of a smile on his face. Before him was\u00a0an arena of empty chairs soon to be filled by members of the party he has been hand-picked to one day lead. On Wednesday, when Vance addresses the convention, he will do so not only as the party\u2019s vice presidential nominee but as its MAGA heir-in-waiting. In tapping a 39-year-old first-term senator from the country\u2019s heartland over more experienced Republicans with deeper party ties, Trump is looking ahead to the future of his political movement. Those close to Trump say he\u00a0is looking to Vance to lead the party beyond his time in office, an expectation he never seriously harbored for his previous vice president, Mike Pence. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that Trump wants someone who can carry the movement on,\u201d a person close to Trump told CNN said of the Vance selection. His choice of whom to carry the torch remained concealed until Trump was ready to reveal it, but the anointment of Vance shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. Trump\u2019s campaign had said for months that the former president sought in a running mate \u201ca strong leader who will make a great president for eight years after his next four-year term concludes.\u201d How could that person be North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who would be 71 years old next election cycle? Or Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican well liked by donors but who still faces skeptics among Trump\u2019s most loyal supporters. How could it have been anyone other than Vance, who in two years in Washington has embodied a new generation of populist, pugilistic leaders styled after Trump? \u201cWhat Trump\u2019s doing here,\u201d said Jack Posobiec, a right-wing devotee of the former president with millions of online followers, \u201cis showing that he wants the next generation of America first, the next generation of conservatives, the next generation of the party to really be one that has come up through his movement, through his wing of the party, as opposed to the more neo-conservative George Bush wing.\u201d Once a self-described \u201cNever Trump guy,\u201d Vance reemerged in politics as a supporter with the help of the former president\u2019s eldest son. Donald Trump Jr., who has always understood and connected with his father\u2019s most ardent supporters better than most in their family, identified early the traits he believed made Vance worth reconsidering. Vance carried a compelling backstory \u2013 son of a heroin addict, raised by his grandparents in poverty-stricken rust-belt Ohio before\u00a0enlisting in the Marines and attending the Ohio State University and Yale Law\u00a0\u2013 that he captured in his best selling book \u201cHillbilly Elegy.\u201d He was a gifted public speaker, too, whose message resonated with middle America and put elites in both parties on notice. The two became close friends, a relationship that helped Vance earn Trump\u2019s endorsement in a contested primary for an open Ohio Senate seat. Vance eventually won the primary and the general election in 2022. As a senator, Vance quickly won over the thought leaders of Trump\u2019s populist movement. He has not only proven an effective defender of Trump on cable television, he has also articulated the isolationist wing skepticism of US involvement in the Russia-Ukraine war. A deeply reported Politico profile that declared Vance the standard-bearer of the New Right included glowing praise from the vanguards of the MAGA movement. Conservative commentator Tucker Carlson said Vance was \u201cby the far the smartest and the deepest (senator) of any I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon \u2013 who hosted Vance occasionally on his far-right \u201cWar Room\u201d podcast before heading to prison earlier this month for refusing to cooperate with a congressional investigation into the January 6, 2021,\u00a0attack on the US Capitol \u2013 told Politico in March: \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll run for the presidency one day.\u201d Bannon, Carlson and Trump Jr. proved instrumental in influencing Trump\u2019s pick, including in conversations with the former president in the final days before his announcement. Vance and Trump Jr. embraced on the convention stage Tuesday afternoon as they prepared for their moments in the spotlight. \u201cI have seen his actions in the Senate,\u201d said Trump Jr., who will introduce Vance on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten to know him over the last few years. The youth, the vigor, his ability to really prosecute the case. I see him do so much better in,\u00a0sort of, let\u2019s call it hostile media territory.\u201d Inside the convention hall, many Republicans quickly coalesced around Vance as their new vice presidential nominee and the future of their party. \u201cIf Donald Trump feels confident and has that certainty for JD to carry that mantle, he is going to make sure that person is sincere in his belief in the MAGA movement, in the America First movement,\u201d said Florida Rep. Kat Cammack, a millennial like Vance who has become a leading voice among the new generation of Republicans. Still, doubters remain. A senior Republican official told CNN, \u201cI don\u2019t know what Vance brings to the ticket\u201d and another Republican adviser working on House and Senate races bristled at the suggestion Vance could help attract voters turned off by Trump. \u201cHow does JD win over (Nikki) Haley voters?\u201d the adviser asked. Challenges certainly remain for Vance to maintain his position as next in line to the throne in Trump\u2019s party. No one other than Trump has demonstrated they can hold together the loose coalition of voters that currently make up the party\u2019s base, some of whom never cast a ballot before the former reality television star decided to dabble in politics. Only Trump has managed to\u00a0appease Evangelical voters and pro-business Republicans while still convincing some of the Democratic Party\u2019s bedrock supporters \u2013 Black voters, Latinos and union households \u2013 to consider switching parties. As some of his detractors eagerly pointed out during Trump\u2019s search, Vance won his Senate seat two years ago by just\u00a06 points in solidly red Ohio \u2013 running 19 points behind the state\u2019s Republican governor, Mike DeWine, in the same election. Trump, too, is known to turn quickly on those who he doesn\u2019t feel are still politically useful to him. No one knows that better than Vance\u2019s predecessor on the GOP ticket, Pence. As one long-time confidante of the former president put it, Vance \u201cwill be the front runner as long as (Trump) says so.\u201d Other Republicans will also certainly have a say as to who they believe should lead the party next \u2013 especially if the Trump-Vance ticket fails to win back the White House this November. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t guarantee it but Ronald Reagan was president for two terms and George Herbert Walker Bush was president after that,\u201d said former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, himself once considered the future of his party. \u201cIn the end,\u00a0it all depends on getting elected first and foremost but what happens after that.\u201d Still, Vance is viewed as an immediate obstacle for anyone looking beyond Trump to 2028. Michelle Crawford, president of the Iowa Federation of Republican Women, cautioned four years is a long time but acknowledged Vance would likely have a major advantage in her state, the traditional first stop on the GOP presidential\u00a0nominating calendar. \u201cSo much can transpire, but I think there\u2019s absolutely potential for that,\u201d Crawford said. \u201cAnd if Trump has confidence in him, the Iowa delegation will get behind that as well.\u201d Inside Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 political orbit, hope rested on Trump naming\u00a0Burgum as\u00a0his running mate, believing it would leave a greater opening for someone else to emerge as the new face of the GOP in four years, multiple people told CNN. One fundraiser for DeSantis said Vance as a \u201cyoung peer leader of the Trump wing of the party\u201d represents an immediate threat to the Florida governor\u2019s political future. Among Trump\u2019s staunchest allies, people like DeSantis who challenged the former president or didn\u2019t stand by him sufficiently are now viewed as unworthy successors. \u201cGov. DeSantis had a perfect opportunity to be the heir if he wanted to be,\u201d Posobiec told CNN. \u201cHe could\u2019ve endorsed Donald Trump and he could\u2019ve been his greatest champion throughout this entire process and maybe it would\u2019ve been him getting the pick today. But as we know, he made his decision.\u201d John Fredericks, a longtime conservative radio host in Virginia who has interviewed Trump on several occasions, called the selection of Vance a \u201c12-year legacy pick\u201d that \u201cended the presidential aspirations\u201d of his home state governor, Glenn Youngkin, and others eyeing a shot at the party\u2019s nomination once Trump is no longer in the picture. \u201cYou can forget about Youngkin,\u201d Fredericks told CNN from the convention floor Monday. \u201cTrump iced them all out. This is his legacy. He knows it. He has four years and he\u2019s done. So he needs someone to continue that legacy. That\u2019s why he picked JD Vance.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny and Alayna Treene contributed to this story.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/jd-vance-rnc-speech/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Because he did seem a little off.\u201d Her husband, fellow Biden voter Troy Reissmann, hung in to the debate\u2019s end, reaching for the phone during former President Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0closing statement. \u201cYeah, it was definitely scary,\u201d Troy Reissmann said of Biden\u2019s performance. \u201cThe first people that I\u00a0called were my parents, who are really old. And I said, \u2018What did you guys think about that?\u2019 Because I still know where I\u2019m going to vote, where my vote is going to lie. But\u00a0they don\u2019t. And they were equally as scared.\u201d The Reissmanns own the Shinery, a moonshine bar in\u00a0Cedarburg, a small, picturesque\u00a0city about 30 minutes north of Milwaukee. What were once textile mills are now bars, restaurants, inns and art galleries.\u00a0Local after local talks about living in a real-life Hallmark movie or a Norman Rockwell painting. The Reissmanns \u2014 civil, affable and politically minded \u2014 have a message for the candidate they both supported in 2020. \u201cThink of the future. Think of our kids and grandkids,\u201d Troy Reissmann said. \u201cMaybe you should step aside only because there\u2019s \u2014 the future doesn\u2019t look too bright with the other side taking\u00a0over. And maybe I\u2019m wrong, and I hope I would be, but you know, it\u2019s scary.\u201d Lisa Reissmann agreed. \u201cI think it is time. We just need fresh leadership, new leadership. \u2026 I like Joe Biden as a person, you know. I think he stands for good things. But I am just not sure he\u2019s there anymore to lead the\u00a0country.\u201d The Reissmanns \u2014 and\u00a0Cedarburg \u2014 are now part of a\u00a0CNN project designed to track the 2024\u00a0campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds and are part of\u00a0critical voting blocs. Cedarburg, population 12,000, would not have made such a list until recently. It was once reliably Republican. Mitt Romney won 63% of the vote here just a dozen years ago, in 2012. Trump won in 2016, but his share of the vote dropped to 55%. Then Biden eked out a 19-vote win in\u00a0Cedarburg in 2020 \u2014 a\u00a0combination, locals say, of population shifts and Trump\u2019s suburban struggles with moderate Republicans and GOP-leaning independents. Gina\u00a0Cilento fits, though perhaps not perfectly, in the latter group. \u201cI\u00a0can\u2019t say right now,\u201d\u00a0Cilento said when asked her 2024 presidential preference. \u201cI\u2019m undecided.\u201d Biden\u2019s debate debacle hasn\u2019t automatically translated into more support for Trump, at least in Cedarburg. Cilento tends to vote Republican and has never voted for a Democrat for president. But she is disgusted with today\u2019s politics and\u00a0calls herself \u201cleaning more independent or straight up libertarianism.\u201d \u201cMy politics are\u00a0currently very \u2014 a place of being kind of over it,\u201d\u00a0Cilento said in an interview at her growing\u00a0Cedarburg pickleball studio. \u201cEvery time you go to the polls \u2014 this is the best our\u00a0country\u00a0can do? \u2026 We are one of the greatest\u00a0countries in the whole entire world and this is what we\u2019re \u2014 these are our deliverables? It\u2019s very frustrating. \u2026 I just feel overall sadness, and to me the biggest issue is that a house divided\u00a0cannot stand. And there\u2019s truth to that and I\u2019m seeing our\u00a0country erode instead of thrive.\u201d We find dismay and disgust at the presidential\u00a0choices everywhere we travel. Worries about political polarization \u2014 \u201ca house divided\u201d as\u00a0Cilento put it \u2014 were common among Americans who have a history of voting Republican but a hard time voting for Trump because of a tone they find abrasive and antagonistic. To that end,\u00a0Cilento said she \u201cwould entertain\u201d voting third-party. She\u00a0cannot imagine voting for Biden and said she was saddened by his debate performance.\u00a0She said she would at least take a look at a new Democrat if Biden stepped aside. \u201cI\u2019m in a place where I\u2019m wanting to feel\u00a0connected,\u201d she said. Cilento \u2014 a former tennis pro turned\u00a0competitive, touring pickleball player \u2014 sees voters of all stripes at her facility. But political\u00a0conversations there tend to be brief and polite. \u201cIt is really just a place for people to forget what is going on in the real world, and they\u00a0can focus on just having fun and getting along,\u201d\u00a0she said. Cilento was the grand marshal of this year\u2019s Fourth of July parade in\u00a0Cedarburg, an event \u2014 once featured in a Toby Keith music video \u2014 that is a source of enormous local pride. During the parade, which runs for about two hours, the sidewalks are packed with families as marching bands, antique tractors, and floats sponsored by local businesses wind past stone and shingled buildings with rich histories. \u201cThe\u00a0city itself was really powered by textile mills,\u201d said Melissa Wraalstad, who runs the Wisconsin Museum of Quilts and Fiber Arts, which is located on a\u00a0Cedarburg farmstead once owned by German immigrants. \u201cMid-20th century into the 1970s, the mills\u00a0closed. So\u00a0Cedarburg had to reinvent itself and\u00a0come up with another idea,\u201d Wraalstad said in an interview. \u201cA lot of other towns faltered (but)\u00a0Cedarburg was able to reinvent itself as an arts destination and a tourist town.\u201d Wraalstad noticed another\u00a0change to Cedarburg in 2020, when, for the first time, the lawn signs were roughly evenly split between the Democratic\u00a0and Republican\u00a0candidates.\u00a0Her favorite? A neighboring house where the husband and wife split the lawn \u2014 half Trump; half Biden. Everyone says there are fewer signs this year. Maybe it is just early. Or maybe it\u2019s a reflection of what Wraalstad heard a lot from museum visitors and friends after the debate. \u201cPeople weren\u2019t thrilled with either of them, for the most part,\u201d she said. And the review of Biden\u2019s debate? \u201cThe same\u00a0concerns people all over the\u00a0country have about age,\u201d said Wraalstad, who said she was an independent\u00a0who\u00a0could not discuss her personal opinions because of her museum role. The lack of enthusiasm for both major-party\u00a0candidates was also evident at a giant post-parade picnic\u00a0at a local park. There were a modest number of Trump hats and shirts; some, but fewer, signs of Biden branding.\u00a0Conversations with a half-dozen Democrats were dominated by their worries about Biden\u2019s debate performance and their view it had damaged his\u00a0chances of winning Wisconsin again. (The president narrowly carried the state in 2020 after Trump won it four years earlier.) Allen Naparalla tracks the political\u00a0change here by the dwindling number of eye rolls and\u00a0complaints about the slogan of his\u00a0Chiselled Grape Winery right along\u00a0Cedarburg\u2019s main drag: \u201cSexy Wines \u2013 Taste the Juice.\u201d Five years ago, he said, when he opened the shop, he had \u201csome issues with people.\u201dPeople said things like \u201c\u2018what is that?\u2019\u201d and \u201c\u2018that\u2019s disgusting,\u2019\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cNow you are kind of getting on an even keel between\u00a0conservative and liberal.\u201d Naparalla moved here to\u00a0care for his aging mother. His wines are made and bottled in\u00a0California and sold in a welcoming\u00a0caf\u00e9 where locals mingle with tourists. In a\u00a0campaign year like this, politics are a frequent topic\u00a0of\u00a0conversation. \u201cI make it a safe environment,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cEveryone has a right to speak. Everyone has a right to say what they feel.\u201d He\u00a0calls himself a fiscal\u00a0conservative and social liberal, someone who thinks Washington should spend less money but ban assault-style rifles. \u201cI\u2019m having a horrible, difficult time,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u00a0constant fighting and bickering. \u2026 It\u2019s the middle\u00a0class that is not being represented anymore. The actual worker. The small businessman.\u201d In one breath, he says he is undecided when it\u00a0comes to the 2024 presidential election. In the next, he says he\u00a0can\u2019t vote for Trump and doesn\u2019t see a viable third-party option. Naparalla, too, watched the debate. \u201cHorrible. I mean it was awful,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cWatching Biden try to get through his words was just bad. Just bad. Now everyone has a bad day. I get it. But the thing is, this was a time \u2014 this was your time to shine, you know?\u201d Did Biden look\u00a0capable of serving four and a half more years? \u201cI don\u2019t, I think that what\u2019s \u2026\u201d said Naparalla \u2014 not often at a loss for words \u2014 as he stumbled a bit trying to settle on his answer. \u201cLet me put it this way: I\u2019m voting for the party right now.\u201d This sentiment from Naparalla\u00a0came up a lot in our\u00a0Cedarburg\u00a0conversations: \u201cBefore the debate, I thought Biden\u00a0could still pull it out.\u201d Now, Naparalla and many\u00a0certain or likely Biden voters here voice doubts that the president\u00a0can\u00a0carry Wisconsin and win reelection. And they fear a Trump return to the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be probably a hairy time for a while,\u201d Naparalla said. Yet he is not\u00a0convinced switching\u00a0candidates is the answer. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said when asked whether he believed Vice President Kamala Harris is qualified to be president. He spends a lot of time in\u00a0California and said he does not think Gov. Gavin Newsom should be the nominee, either. Naparalla understands why some people are\u00a0calling for Biden to step aside. But he is skeptical. \u201cWho\u2019s going to do it?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s so late in the election process that, you know, Trump will be a shoo-in anyway. \u2026 I just think it is too late.\u201d Naparalla was not the only voter we spoke to in\u00a0Cedarburg to pose this challenge to Biden\u2019s team and top Democrats: \u201cIf you\u2019re really\u00a0concerned about your party, then do something before this. You know what I mean?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/politics/wisconsin-voters-biden-debate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_13_politics_republicans-democrats-strategy-flawed-candidates-what-matters", "text": "Which one of these candidates is facing calls from members of their own party to step aside in the presidential race: \u25ba Is it the recently convicted felon, also indicted for election interference and mishandling classified documents, who was also found liable for sexual abuse and defamation as well as lying about his net worth to get loans tied to his massive real estate portfolio? \u25ba Or is it the incumbent president with a recent record of accomplishment in a bipartisan infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act, which is a dubiously named piece of legislation that nonetheless addressed many of his party\u2019s priorities, like climate change? Both men are well into retirement age. Both ramble through answers to questions when they bother to take them. Both mix up names. Neither took part in debates during a primary season in which they racked up wins. And yet one of the men, former President Donald Trump, 78, has been able to remake the Republican Party around his own divisive persona. The other, President Joe Biden, 81, has now spent weeks defiantly defending his fitness for the job, slowly emerging from a protective bubble at the White House after a disastrous debate and spotty subsequent interviews. The next week will offer a fresh look at what must feel like a cruel dichotomy to Biden supporters. The GOP is now built around Trump When the Republican National Convention gets underway Monday, it will show off a speaking schedule full of far right personalities and an official party platform rewritten and simplified around Trump\u2019s priorities. Trump, between now and then, will pick a vice president from a short list of people who have previously criticized him but are now all in. In 2016, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination with insults about the size of Trump\u2019s hands, calling him a con man and arguing he couldn\u2019t be trusted with nuclear codes. Now Rubio is a Trump convert. So is Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, who went from never-Trumper to true believer. Some Democrats are moving in an opposite direction. Longtime supporters now want Biden out of the race for fear he can\u2019t beat Trump, which\u00a0is\u00a0the one and only goal of Democrats afraid of his return to the White House. In any event, Rubio and Vance, along with Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who are also reportedly on Trump\u2019s vice presidential short list, should be wary. His previous vice president, Mike Pence, is among the many people who served in Trump\u2019s first White House who have not endorsed Trump\u2019s latest election bid after an angry mob, inspired by Trump, stormed the Capitol with chants of \u201chang Mike Pence.\u201d Republicans had the opportunity to go a different direction. A CNN poll released back in February, before Trump had sealed the Republican presidential nomination, suggested his top Republican rival, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley would fare much better in a head-to-head contest with Biden. Republican primary voters doubled down, decisively, on Trump. One of Haley\u2019s major policy proposals was a test for for older candidates like Biden and Trump, a prescient idea since Biden is now facing calls that he take a cognitive test and Trump has bragged that he could easily pass one. Still trying to convince fellow Democrats While Trump eyes a convention to celebrate his dominance next week, Biden is fighting back the argument that Democratic convention delegates should pick a younger successor next month. The latest in a series of public tests of Biden\u2019s abilities will be another interview with a network news anchor, NBC this time, broadcast in prime time on Monday. It\u2019s late in the election cycle for Democrats to be having this conversation, since the primary season has ended, their convention takes place next month and Trump is currently thought to have an advantage in key states heading into the November election. There are some indications Biden is regaining some support among key Democrats. While over a dozen lawmakers have called on him to drop out, with the number continuing to rise Friday, Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, a longtime ally, said on the \u201cToday\u201d show that the conversation about Biden\u2019s fitness needs to end before it hurts the party. \u201cI\u2019m ridin\u2019 with Biden,\u201d Clyburn said. If Biden dropped out, Clyburn said he would back Vice President Kamala Harris. Progressives lawmakers, people like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent \u2013 not Biden\u2019s natural allies on the policy front \u2013 are also standing up for Biden, arguing the party should rally around him and mobilize for November. Biden, meanwhile, despite the majority of polling that suggests he trails Trump in key states likely to decide the election, said at a rare news conference Thursday that he hasn\u2019t been shown polling data that suggests he would lose in November. The fact that he said polling data could theoretically convince him to leave the race is an adjustment from last week, when he told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos only \u201cthe Lord Almighty\u201d could sway him. A bridge no more Biden also said at the news conference that he had changed his mind about a 2020 pledge to be a \u201cbridge\u201d between his older generation of lawmakers and and a new generation of leaders. \u201cWhat I realized was, my long time in the Senate had equipped me to have the wisdom and know how to deal with the Congress to get things done,\u201d he said. Convinced he can beat Trump Biden also clearly believes that he is still the best person to beat Trump \u2013 the motivating principle for any Democrat these days \u2013 and Biden has been shocked during his presidency at the staying power of Trump and the MAGA turn of the GOP. \u201cHe thought it would be in the rearview mirror by now,\u201d said Chris Whipple, author of a recent book about Biden\u2019s presidency, \u201cThe Fight of His Life,\u201d speaking to CNN\u2019s Jessica Dean Friday. \u201cI don\u2019t think he was necessarily planning to be a two-term president, but now that Trump is the alternative, Joe Biden really believes in his bones that he\u2019s the guy to beat him,\u201d Whipple said. In an odd twist, then, the thing keeping Biden in the race may be the very thing that has caused other Democrats to call for him to drop out.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/politics/republicans-democrats-strategy-flawed-candidates-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_politics_senate-races-biden-analysis", "text": "The stakes for Democrats in their extraordinary public schism over whether President Joe Biden should withdraw from the 2024 presidential race extend far beyond the White House. A decisive loss at the top of the ticket could cost Democrats control of the US Senate for the remainder of this decade and cement Republican dominance of the Supreme Court for a generation. So far, Democratic anxiety about the presidential race\u2019s impact on the Senate has been muted because public polling has almost invariably shown their candidates still leading in the key states where Biden has fallen behind former President Donald Trump. But recent history raises deep questions about whether Democratic Senate candidates can continue to levitate as far above the presidential ticket as polls now show. Throughout this century, but especially over roughly the past decade, it has grown increasingly difficult for Senate candidates in either party to win in states that usually vote for the other side in presidential contests. During the 2016 and 2020 election years, Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine was the only candidate, out of 69 total Senate races, who won in a state that voted the other way at the presidential level. This year, Democrats are defending an unusually large concentration of Senate seats in states that now appear at risk for them in the presidential contest. If Democrats lose a substantial number of those seats this year, it could be very difficult for them to recapture a Senate majority before these same seats come up again in 2030. The reason is that very few of the other Senate seats Republicans now hold are in states where Democrats have a realistic chance of winning, absent a dramatic change in their political balance. In turn, extended GOP control of the Senate, coupled with a return of Trump to the White House, would give the party ample time to nominate and confirm much younger replacements for Samuel Alito (74) and Clarence Thomas (76), the two oldest and most conservative Supreme Court Justices, and possibly also Sonia Sotomayor (70), the oldest Democratic-appointed justice. \u201cBecause of the big sorting out of the states \u2026 Democrats have a narrower path to a Senate majority than Republicans do, which means this year is crucial,\u201d said former Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana. \u201cThe margin of error [for Democrats] is not high, and the consequences will be with us for another six years.\u201d If the presidential and Senate elections go badly for Democrats, Bayh added, Republicans \u201ccould change the judicial branch of government for a generation.\u201d Vulnerable Democratic Senate seats this year fall into three broad buckets. The first includes three states that Trump carried in 2016 and 2020 and that he is virtually certain to win again \u2014 likely by a substantial margin. In that group, both sides concede the GOP will win the West Virginia seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Joe Manchin, who\u2019s now an independent but still caucuses with Democrats; veteran Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jon Tester of Montana, who have survived difficult reelections even as their states have moved right, are facing substantial challenges this year. If Republicans win just two of those three states, they would still seize control of the Senate (absent offsetting Democratic wins in any GOP-held seats, which are unlikely). But if Democrats only lost some combination of the three 2020 Trump states, they would remain close enough to the GOP in the chamber to retain realistic hopes of recapturing the Senate in 2026 or 2028. The real risk to Democrats is that their losses could extend beyond that inner circle of strongly red-leaning states \u2014 particularly if the presidential race goes badly. Democrats are defending five more Senate seats this year in presidential swing states where most polls now show Biden trailing, or at best running even. That list includes Democratic Sens. Bob Casey in Pennsylvania, Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin and Jacky Rosen in Nevada, as well as Reps. Elissa Slotkin and Ruben Gallego, who are seeking open Senate seats now held by Democrats in Michigan and Arizona respectively. (Retiring Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona still caucuses with Democrats after becoming an independent.) Biden\u2019s 2020 margin of victory was three points or less in all of those states. As Biden\u2019s position has weakened since last month\u2019s CNN debate, strategists in both parties are just beginning to look at another circle of Democratic-held Senate seats in more strongly blue-leaning states where some polls have suggested an unexpectedly competitive presidential race. Topping that list are the contests in New Mexico, where Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich is facing Nella Domenici, the daughter of the late Pete Domenici, a long-time Republican senator from the state; and New Jersey, where Republicans chose a relatively centrist nominee, Curtis Bashaw, to oppose Democratic Rep. Andy Kim in a race complicated by the\u00a0possible independent candidacy\u00a0of indicted Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez. Even if the Democrats\u2019 vulnerability ultimately does not extend to that outer perimeter, significant losses for the party in the first two circles,\u00a0as I\u2019ve written, could leave them with few paths back to a Senate majority for the remainder of this decade. This year, the only Republican senators Democrats are targeting are Rick Scott in Florida and Ted Cruz in Texas, and Biden\u2019s difficulties in both states leave Democrats facing huge headwinds in those races. The list of other Republican-held Senate seats that Democrats can realistically target in the years to come, based on the states\u2019 current political leanings, is small. Republicans hold only two Senate seats in states that voted for Biden last time (Collins, who will face reelection in 2026, and Wisconsin\u2019s Ron Johnson, who isn\u2019t up until 2028 after narrowly winning another term in 2022). North Carolina is the only other state with Republican senators where Biden finished within 3 points of Trump in 2020 \u2014 and even there, Democrats have not won a presidential or Senate contest since 2008. Beyond these four seats \u2014 Maine, Wisconsin and the two in North Carolina \u2014 Democrats have no more tempting targets before 2030 among Republican-held Senate seats than Florida, Iowa and Ohio, all of which are long shots for them. Meanwhile, Democrats will have another round of their own swing state Senate seats to defend over those two elections. All of this means the seats Democrats could lose this year if the presidential ticket drags down their Senate nominees in states such as Michigan, Nevada and Arizona are virtually irreplaceable for them. \u201cA Democratic Senate majority coalition relies on having both Senators from a state such as Michigan,\u201d said Daniel Hopkins, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist. Absent a major external event, such as an economic crash while Republicans hold the White House, \u201cif the Democrats don\u2019t hold their own in the Senate this year, it is hard to see how they recover\u201d before 2030, he added. The prospect that Biden\u2019s eroding position could produce a lasting Senate deficit \u2014 which, in turn, could allow Republicans to further reshape the federal judiciary, including the Supreme Court \u2014 hasn\u2019t produced panic among Democrats yet because of the public and private polls consistently showing their Senate candidates running well ahead of the president.\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s true before the debate is true after: for voters, Senate campaigns are candidate vs. candidate battles,\u201d said David Bergstein, communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Optimistic Democrats believe the personal vulnerabilities of the GOP challengers \u2014 which include a disproportionate number of wealthy business people without much, or any, prior political experience \u2014 will allow their candidates to survive even a substantial undertow in the presidential contest. \u201cRepublicans have a roster of deeply flawed recruits, and we\u2019ll win because we have the better candidates,\u201d Bergstein said. But Republicans say the Democratic advantage in these races is only temporary. \u201cOur challengers are still building name ID, which is the reason they are lagging the Presidential ballot at this point,\u201d Mike Berg, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in an email. \u201cExpect the horse race numbers to tighten significantly as Republican candidates begin advertising more heavily. The more important number to look at right now is the ballot share the [Democratic] incumbents are receiving - which is consistently below 50 in our target states.\u201d Lee Drutman, a senior fellow in the political reform program at New America, a center-left think tank, likewise thinks \u201cit seems unlikely that you could have as big of a gap\u201d between Biden and Democratic Senate candidates as polls now show. While many of the GOP nominees are weak, Drutman said, Biden\u2019s struggles could depress Democratic turnout in a way that hurts the party up and down the ballot. \u201cIf Democrats stick with Biden after all this,\u201d Drutman predicted, \u201cI would expect Democratic voter enthusiasm to plummet.\u201d Many Democratic pollsters and operatives are also nervous about the contrast between current polling and recent history. One leading Democratic pollster, who asked for anonymity while discussing campaign strategy, told me that in several of the swing states, post-debate polls show Democratic Senate candidates clinging to small leads while Biden has fallen substantially behind Trump. \u201cI just don\u2019t know if we can hold that kind of gap,\u201d the pollster said. \u201cYou are setting up the classic dynamic where the Senate candidates have to win with people who are not voting for him [Biden].\u201d Jason Kander has experience trying to navigate those treacherous waters. In 2016, as the Democratic Senate candidate in Missouri, Kander ran over 8 percentage points ahead of presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, one of the widest gaps anywhere in the country that year. But when Clinton lost the state by almost 525,000 votes, Kander still fell short against Republican Sen. Roy Blunt. Kander said that it is impossible for any Senate candidate to completely escape the gravitational pull of the presidential contest. \u201cThe presidential race doesn\u2019t just dominate politics, it dominates popular culture during a presidential year,\u201d he told me. \u201cNearly everything is a response to that. Not just in politics, but in everything.\u201d Kander said he believes it will be easier for incumbent senators, who have longer relationships with voters, to establish an identity separate from the presidential nominee than it was for him as a challenger. But, in either circumstance, he believes the key to outrunning the presidential ticket is to convey authenticity and independence. That doesn\u2019t require, he said, breaking from the presidential ticket on high-profile policy issues: \u201cI can\u2019t even think of an issue where it would be in the political interest of a candidate to break from Biden this year, with the exception of regional issues,\u201d he said. But it does demand, he believes, that candidates show themselves to be genuinely rooted in the values and experiences of their state. Given that necessity, Kander said that it would be a mistake for the White House to demand that Democrats unwaveringly dismiss voter concerns about Biden\u2019s age. \u201cIf what happens in this election is President Biden asks down-ballot candidates to go to voters and say that they have zero concerns whatsoever and what they saw in the debate didn\u2019t bother them at all, there is a possibility that you are asking them to sacrifice some credibility in the exact same way that President Trump did in the mid-terms when he required a lot of candidates to go out and say that the election was rigged,\u201d Kander said. \u201cA lot of independent voters looked at that and said that makes me question your credibility on every other argument you are making.\u201d Bayh, who had stepped down from the Senate in 2010, also ran on that 2016 ballot with Clinton when he tried to regain an open Indiana Senate seat. Bayh ran about 5 points ahead of her, but fell to Republican Todd Young when Clinton lost Indiana by about 525,000 votes. Bayh told me that over the course of his political career, which included two elections as Indiana\u2019s governor beginning in 1988, the number of voters willing to vote for presidential candidates of one party and lower-ballot candidates of the other markedly declined, especially in congressional and Senate races. In many ways, he said, that has been a rational response from voters to the transformation of the House and Senate into quasi-parliamentary institutions with much higher levels of party-line voting than through most of the 20th\u00a0century. \u201cThe public has kind of looked at that and figured it out that it\u2019s become more parliamentary,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see a dramatic decline in split ticket voting and much more people voting red team or blue team.\u201d That shift has accelerated in recent years. As recently as the 1980s, it was common for voters to split their tickets in Senate races. After Ronald Reagan\u2019s landslide victory in 1984, for instance, Democrats still controlled about half the Senate seats in the states that voted for him both times \u2014 many of them conservative Southern states still unwilling to vote for Republicans below the presidential level. By 2012, though, Democrats held over four-fifths of the Senate seats in the states that twice voted for Barack Obama while Republicans held more than three-fourths of them in the states that twice voted against him. Still, even that alignment left room for some Senate candidates to swim against this general tide. When Obama was first elected in 2008, six Democrats won in states that voted against him, and Collins won in Maine, which voted for him. In Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection, five other Democratic Senate candidates won in states that voted against him, while Republican Dean Heller won in Nevada, which supported Obama. Since 2012, though, voters have relentlessly pruned these \u201cmismatched\u201d Senate candidates. In the 2014 and 2018 midterm elections, Democrats lost nine of the 11 Senate seats they won in states that voted against Obama during his two presidential races. And while Collins was reelected in 2014, Heller \u2014 the only other GOP senator elected in a state that voted Democratic during Obama\u2019s two races \u2014 was defeated in 2018. In the presidential election years, the pull of the presidential outcome on Senate results has become even more profound. In 2016, for the first time since the direct election of senators, all 34 Senate races went the same way as the presidential result in that state; in 2020, when 35 Senate contests (including two special elections) were held, only Collins defied the presidential outcome. The 2020 results demonstrated the strength of this current most powerfully in the failed Democratic attempt to capture six GOP-held Senate seats in Republican leaning states. Democratic Senate challengers that year in Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Montana, South Carolina, and Texas spent a combined $382 million on their campaigns, a remarkable sum. And yet when Biden lost those states, so did all six Democratic challengers. Despite the huge sums the six raised and spent, Montana\u2019s outgoing Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock was the only one among them who ran more than 2.1 percentage points ahead of Biden in their state. In those races, Republicans recognized they could win even if the Democratic candidates outspent them or maintained relatively favorable personal images, said Republican consultant Jesse Hunt, who served as the NRSC\u2019s communications director in 2020. \u201cAs long as everything was kept close, we knew the sheer atmospherics\u201d of the presidential race would tip the result, he said. \u201cMoney, personal popularity, image and name identification don\u2019t actually matter if the margin at the top of the ticket is overwhelming.\u201d Like other Republicans, Hunt believes that these historic trends in Senate races mean that the Democrats now clinging to their leads as Biden slips \u201care all at risk.\u201d\u00a0Several Democratic sources told me the party senators on the ballot this year are acutely aware that just one of the 69 Senate races in 2016 and 2020 favored the party that lost the presidential race in that state. This history, by itself, doesn\u2019t answer whether Democratic Senate candidates would have better prospects with or without Biden as their presidential nominee. But it does tell them that the consequences of the party\u2019s choice on whether to stick with Biden are certain to reverberate beyond the White House. \u201cDemocrats certainly cannot rely on the idea that Senate races will be decoupled from the presidential race,\u201d said Hopkins, the political scientist, \u201cbecause they won\u2019t.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/politics/senate-races-biden-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_politics_special-counsel-appeals-dismissal-of-trump-classified-documents-case", "text": "Special counsel Jack Smith said Wednesday that\u00a0he is appealing\u00a0a judge\u2019s\u00a0decision to throw out the\u00a0indictment against Donald Trump\u00a0concerning his handling of classified documents. The special counsel team filed a notice of appeal, the initial procedural mechanism that sets the appeal in motion, on Wednesday, just two days after US District Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the prosecution and well ahead of the 30-day deadline the prosecutors faced for bringing the appeal. This means the shock ruling would be reviewed by judges from the 11th US Circuit Court of\u00a0Appeals based in Atlanta. The two-page filing from Smith\u2019s team did not indicate whether the prosecutors will seek to speed up the appeals process. Though the appellate court is conservative-leaning, with half of the full-time judges being appointed personally by Trump, some of its rulings have defied the court\u2019s ideological tilt. A three-judge panel ruled against Cannon on a critical legal matter earlier in the Trump documents investigation. The three GOP appointees on that panel\u00a0unanimously overturned\u00a0her decision to appoint a \u201cspecial master\u201d to review the materials that the FBI seized during their raid of Mar-a-Lago in summer 2022. In another notable ruling, the\u00a0appeals court last year\u00a0unanimously rejected\u00a0former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows\u2019 attempt to move his Georgia election subversion criminal case to federal court. That decision was penned by a conservative judge who was appointed by former President George W. Bush. Cannon in her ruling on Monday had said that Smith\u2019s appointment as special counsel was unconstitutional, warranting the dismissal of the case against Trump. Another court will weigh the legality of special counsels Cannon\u2019s dismissal decision brought to an end \u2014 at least for now \u2014 the criminal proceedings that had been inching along in her Fort Pierce, Florida, courtroom since the charges were brought last summer. The former president was charged with 32 counts of unlawfully retaining national defense information and another eight counts related to his alleged obstruction of the federal probe into the documents. Smith additionally charged two of Trump\u2019s employees \u2014 his personal valet, Walt Nauta, and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira \u2014 for allegedly assisting in the obstruction scheme. The case was one of four criminal cases brought against the former president last year. Unlike the other cases, which relied on somewhat novel legal theories targeting Trump\u2019s conduct in the 2016 and 2020 elections, the documents case was seen as more straightforward for how it resembled prosecutions the Justice Department brings routinely against current and former government officials who mishandle sensitive documents. But prosecutors encountered many hurdles in how Cannon presided over the case, culminating in her bombshell ruling on Monday invalidating Smith\u2019s appointment. Her decision was at odds with the rulings of judges across the country that rejected attacks on the legality of special counsel appointments. But Cannon\u2019s legal rationale \u2013 in which she concluded that Congress had not passed any laws giving Attorney General Merrick Garland the authority to appoint a special counsel like Smith \u2014 was foreshadowed by a concurring opinion written by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas in the high court\u2019s recent presidential immunity case. Thomas raised similar concerns about the constitutionality of Smith\u2019s appointment, though no other justices joined him in the concurrence, which he wrote in a dispute arising from the election subversion case Smith election brought in Washington, DC. The entire Supreme Court may eventually be forced to weigh in, particularly if the 11th Circuit agrees with Cannon, which would stand to create a so-called circuit split with a previous ruling from the federal appeals court in DC upholding the department\u2019s use of a special counsel. Absent a move to speed the appeal in the Trump documents case, it will likely take several months for the appeal to play out in the Atlanta-based appeals court. This case will be the first instance that the 11th Circuit, which oversees federal appeals from Florida, Alabama and Georgia, confronts the question.

{"id": "2024_07_16_politics_teamsters-president-rnc-what-matters", "text": "It was a remarkable moment Monday night at the Republican National Convention, surely creating some amount of confusion among longtime Republicans, when Sean O\u2019Brien, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, delivered a stemwinder of a speech in prime time. He called former President Donald Trump a \u201ctough S.O.B.\u201d O\u2019Brien did not endorse Trump, but he leaned into the incongruity of speaking at the convention of a party that has long fought workers\u2019 ability to organize. The union could vote to endorse a candidate later this year. \u201cThe Teamsters are doing something correct if the extremes in both parties think I shouldn\u2019t be on this stage,\u201d O\u2019Brien said, adding that the union has endorsed Republican presidents Richard Nixon and George H.W. Bush in the past. This year, the Teamsters may not endorse any candidate, even though Biden has fashioned himself as the most pro-labor president in US history. Biden became the first president to join a picket line, when he appeared with striking auto workers in Michigan in 2023. \u201cAt the end of the day, the Teamsters are not interested if you have a \u201cD,\u201d \u201cR\u201d or an \u201cI\u201d next to your name. We want to know one thing,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cWhat are you doing to help American workers?\u201d Appearing Tuesday on \u201cInside Politics,\u201d O\u2019Brien told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash he would speak at both conventions, but has not yet been invited to the Democratic convention. \u201cThe partisanship is not working. We need bipartisan support, we need bipartisan cooperation,\u201d O\u2019Brien said, adding he would definitely speak at the Democratic convention. This after Biden bailed out a Teamster pension fund Biden must be particularly frustrated by O\u2019Brien\u2019s speech since as president in 2022, he OK\u2019d a $36 billion, one-time bailout of a Teamsters pension fund, warding off pension cuts for 350,000 workers and retirees. While Biden has the endorsement of key labor organizations like the AFL-CIO, there\u2019s growing concern among many labor leaders about his ability to win in November. Bash pointed out Trump\u2019s long history of opposing union rights, which O\u2019Brien did not dispute. \u201cIf we\u2019re not having the discussions, how can we change people\u2019s opinions?\u201d he asked. Republicans generally oppose organized labor, but JD Vance joined a picket line During his speech Monday night O\u2019Brien acknowledged the anti-union bent of much of the GOP and said it needs to change. That could take a while. Also Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Elon Musk, the anti-union Tesla boss who has endorsed Trump, would be showering a pro-Trump super PAC with $45 million per month in cash. But it is notable, as O\u2019Brien pointed out, that a handful of Republican senators, including Trump\u2019s new running mate Sen. JD Vance, have joined picket lines in recent years. Vance and other Republican senators, however, oppose the Democrats\u2019 proposal to pass a nationwide law, the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, supported by labor unions including the Teamsters. Also, the selection of Vance, who also spent years as a Silicon Valley Venture Capitalist, was praised by Musk. An anti-corporate message directed at workers, but an anti-union legacy for Trump If there was an overriding theme in speeches at the first night of the Republican convention, which were supposed to focus on Make America Wealthy Again, it was an anti-corporate and anti-elitist message, with frequent mentions of helping workers. That\u2019s in keeping with Trump\u2019s appeal to those who feel marginalized and left behind. Despite Trump\u2019s longtime pro-worker rhetoric, his record as president was decidedly anti-union, as CNN\u2019s Chris Isidore has written. The help Republicans were offering for workers at the RNC Monday, from a policy standpoint, is indirect. They\u2019re not endorsing raising the minimum wage, as Democrats have long supported. Trump is, on the other hand, pushing an idea to exempt tips from taxes. Many states allow employers to pay workers who get tips below that state\u2019s minimum wage. Trump and Vance\u2019s answer to helping auto workers is to end Democrats\u2019 emissions goals, which are meant to pivot the US toward more electric vehicles. The United Auto Workers is among the unions to endorse Biden. Marginal shifts are meaningful In an election that may yet be decided by marginal shifts in the electorate, any movement toward Trump among union households could spell disaster for Biden, who performed better in 2020 than Hillary Clinton in 2016 among union households both nationally and in key states. O\u2019Brien has a brash persona. He made headlines for nearly coming to fisticuffs with Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a Republican from Oklahoma who also happens to have been a professional mixed martial arts fighter. In a nod to that episode, O\u2019Brien namechecked Mullin and said he was paraphrasing the senator with this line: \u201c\u2018It\u2019s time for both sides of Congress to stand their butts up.\u2019 We need trade policies that put American workers first. It needs to be easier for companies to remain in America. We need legal protections that make it safer for workers to get a contract.\u201d On the other hand, it\u2019s worth going back to that original standoff between Mullin and O\u2019Brien, in which Mullin complained that a union had tried to infiltrate his plumbing business. That sounds a little more to type when you\u2019re considering traditional Republican views of unions. In Wisconsin, where the convention is taking place, the former Republican Gov. Scott Walker made a career out of busting government worker unions in his state until he lost a bid for reelection in 2018. Walker did enact so-called \u201cright to work\u201d legislation opposed by unions by making it easier for employees to work for companies without paying union dues even when there is a collective bargaining agreement. Multiple US states, most of them dominated by Republicans, have such legislation. There are many different types of unions and they each have different priorities. Police unions are going to see things differently than auto workers. Trump\u2019s promise to abolish taxes on tips seems tailored to gain some marginal support in Nevada, where he announced the proposal. Government worker unions are a strong part of the labor movement and unlikely to be getting any overtures from a new Trump administration, which has tried to paint the federal bureaucracy as an organized deep state opposed to him. But small movements among certain union members could have a huge impact in November.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/politics/teamsters-president-rnc-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_politics_joe-biden-tests-positive-covid-19", "text": "President Joe Biden tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday, disrupting a key campaign event meant to shore up support with Latino voters at a critical juncture in the election. Biden, 81, was experiencing mild symptoms and has received his first dose of the antiviral drug Paxlovid, according to his doctor. \u201cI feel good,\u201d Biden, who is fully vaccinated and boosted, told reporters Wednesday in Las Vegas, flashing a thumbs-up before boarding Air Force One to head to his Delaware residence. The president will self-isolate there in line with US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance. Biden and his aides have repeatedly cited recent stops on the campaign trail as a demonstration of his vigor as the presumptive Democratic nominee, an attempt to tamp down growing anxieties within the party. Wednesday\u2019s event in Las Vegas \u2013 where he was expected to speak at the UnidosUS annual conference \u2013 was billed as an example of that direct engagement, in this case with a diverse coalition. The UnidosUS event, however, came to a screeching halt with the news that the president had tested positive for Covid-19 following an active day participating in an interview and meeting voters at a local supermarket. \u201cI was just on the phone with President Biden. And he shared his deep disappointment at not being able to join us this afternoon. The president has been at many events as we all know and he just tested positive for Covid,\u201d\u00a0UnidosUS President and CEO Janet Murgu\u00eda told attendees, to audible gasps, after Biden was an hour and a half late to his scheduled appearance onstage. It\u2019s unclear where and when the president contracted Covid-19. But the sudden diagnosis will place him behind closed doors at a time when Democratic lawmakers have been clamoring to see him out front. The CDC recommends staying home until the infected person has been without a fever \u2013 with no fever-reducing medicine \u2013 for at least 24 hours and symptoms have been improving for 24 hours. It then recommends wearing a mask for five days after. As for Biden\u2019s schedule in the coming days and his ability to stay engaged, a White House official told CNN that the president has had Covid-19 before and gotten through those periods by doing a lot of video calls. Something similar should be expected in the days ahead, the official said. A campaign source separately told CNN that the Biden campaign will readjust and do as much as possible remotely. Biden was at his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, residence last weekend as well, making calls to key groups of lawmakers, some of whom continue to harbor deep concerns about his viability as a candidate. The attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump appeared to put public calls for Biden to step aside as the party\u2019s presumptive nominee on pause. But they returned as Biden hit the campaign trail again this week. Just hours before the White House announced Biden\u2019s Covid-19 diagnosis, California Rep. Adam Schiff, a Senate candidate and former House Intelligence chairman, became the most prominent elected Democrat to\u00a0publicly call on the president to drop out of the race. As Trump is set to formally accept the GOP nomination for president at\u00a0this week\u2019s Republican National Convention\u00a0in Milwaukee, Democratic fears persist that Biden cannot defeat him and risks taking down Democrats in down-ballot races with him in November. But even though anger and panic has been steadily rising inside the Democratic Party after Biden\u2019s alarming debate performance in Atlanta nearly three weeks ago, the White House and the Biden campaign are in a new place, multiple Democratic officials told CNN. \u201cThe private conversations with the Hill are continuing,\u201d a senior Democratic adviser tells CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid alienating the campaign and the White House. \u201cHe\u2019s being receptive. Not as defiant as he is publicly.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s gone from saying, \u2018Kamala can\u2019t win,\u2019 to \u2018Do you think Kamala can win?\u201d the adviser said. \u201cIt\u2019s still unclear where he\u2019s going to land but seems to be listening. Despite Biden\u2019s diagnosis, Vice President Kamala Harris was set to keep her Thursday appearance at a campaign event in Fayetteville, North Carolina, as planned, an administration staffer said Wednesday evening. Harris\u2019 husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, tested positive for Covid-19\u00a0earlier this month \u2013 though the vice president tested negative for the virus at the time. Biden, who was spotted not wearing a mask Wednesday before boarding Air Force One, was wearing one in the car and wore one aboard the aircraft to Delaware, a White House official said. Biden had \u201cupper respiratory symptoms, to include rhinorhea (runny nose) and non-productive cough, with general mailaise,\u201d a note from his doctor provided by White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. \u201cHe felt okay for his first event of the day, but given that he was not feeling better, point of care testing for COVID-19 was conducted, and the results were positive for the COVID-19 virus,\u201d the note continued. The president first\u00a0tested positive\u00a0for Covid-19 in July 2022 and suffered\u00a0a second, so-called rebound case in the days after. Biden has received multiple Covid-19 vaccine booster shots, most recently in September 2023,\u00a0according to a memo from his physician. During his first bout with the disease, he experienced mild symptoms, including runny nose, fatigue, high temperature and a cough and was treated with Paxlovid. Covid-19 levels across the country have\u00a0risen in recent weeks, according to the CDC. The most recent data shows that during the week ending July 6, there was a 23.5% increase in emergency visits for Covid-19 compared with the previous week. The CDC also reports that the viral activity level for Covid-19 in wastewater is high nationally as of July 6. This story has been updated with additional developments.

{"id": "2024_07_17_politics_us-imposes-visa-restrictions-elor-azaria", "text": "The Biden administration imposed visa restrictions on former Israel Defense Forces (IDF) sergeant Elor Azaria \u201cfor his involvement in a gross violation of human rights, namely an extrajudicial killing in the West Bank,\u201d State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller announced Wednesday. As a result of the action, Azaria and his immediate family will generally be blocked from coming to the United States. The State Department is \u201calso taking steps to impose visa restrictions on an additional group of individuals for having been involved in or meaningfully contributed to undermining the peace, security, or stability in the West Bank,\u201d Miller said in a statement. \u201cSpecifically, these visa restrictions are being pursued against those who have used violence against persons or property, or unduly restricted civilians\u2019 access to essential services and basic necessities to include access to food, water, electricity, or medical supplies,\u201d he said. \u201cThe immediate family members of these individuals may also be subject to these restrictions.\u201d The Biden administration has taken a series of punitive measures against those accused of perpetrating violence and human rights violations in the West Bank. Last week, the administration imposed its latest tranche of sanctions on an extremist organization and settlements in the Palestinian territory. US officials have called on the Netanyahu government to take further action to hold violent settlers accountable. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been appropriate accountability across the board\u201d in response to the violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, Miller said at a press briefing Wednesday. Miller added that it appeared the Israeli government was taking note of the measures, and had taken \u201csome steps\u201d to crack down on settler violence, but said they need to take further steps. \u201cPart of the point is not just to impose accountability on people who\u2019ve engaged in acts of violence or people who\u2019ve engaged in other acts that increase instability in the West Bank, it is also to let others know that we are paying attention and we are watching and we\u2019re not going to hesitate to act,\u201d Miller said. However, the Biden administration has yet to make a decision on whether to restrict aid to one IDF battalion \u2013 Netzah Yehuda \u2013 which the US found to have committed gross violations of human rights prior to the start of the war in Gaza. A CNN investigation found that former commanders of that unit have been promoted to senior positions in the IDF and are now active in training Israeli ground troops as well as running operations in Gaza. Azaria in 2016 was charged with manslaughter in the fatal shooting of a wounded Palestinian assailant. He was sentenced to 18 months in military prison in 2017. A Palestinian, Abdel Fattah al-Sharif, 21, was one of two men accused of stabbing another Israeli soldier in the West Bank city of Hebron in March. Charges were brought against Azaria after video footage emerged showing him shooting Sharif in the head as he lay on the ground, injured and already subdued. The second Palestinian suspect had already been shot dead. At the State Department briefing Wednesday, Miller explained that the US is required to impose visa restrictions on officials found to have committed gross violations of human rights.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/us-imposes-visa-restrictions-elor-azaria/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_politics_fact-check-night-2-republican-national-convention", "text": "Speakers at the second night of the Republican National Convention made many false and misleading claims throughout the night which focused heavily on immigration and crime. Here is a list of fact checks from CNN\u2019s Facts First team. Speaker Mike Johnson makes false claim about crime under Biden After criticizing President Joe Biden as weak, House Speaker Mike Johnson claimed in his Tuesday speech at the Republican National Convention that Democrats\u2019 policies have brought communities \u201cdramatic increases\u201d in \u201cviolence, crime and drugs.\u201d Similarly, House Republican Conference Chair Rep. Elise Stefanik referred to \u201cBiden\u2019s violent crime crisis,\u201d and a video played near the beginning of the Tuesday evening proceedings featured a narrator saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not just big cities. Rising crime is a problem everywhere.\u201d Facts First: Johnson\u2019s claims about dramatic increases in violence and crime are false, as is the convention video\u2019s claim that there is a problem \u201ceverywhere\u201d with \u201crising crime.\u201d Official data published by the FBI shows violent crime dropped significantly in the US in 2023 and in the first quarter of 2024, though there were increases in some communities; violent crime is now lower than it was in 2020, President Donald Trump\u2019s last calendar year in office. Stefanik\u2019s claim of a \u201cviolent crime crisis\u201d under Biden is subjective, but she certainly did not acknowledge that the current numbers under Biden are superior to final Trump-era numbers. Preliminary FBI data for 2023 showed a roughly 13% national decline in murder and a roughly 6% national decline in overall violent crime compared to 2022, bringing both murder and violent crime levels below where they were in 2020. And preliminary FBI data for the first quarter of 2024 showed an even steeper drop from the same quarter in 2023 \u2013 a roughly 26% decline in murder and roughly 15% decline in overall violent crime. There are limitations to the FBI-published data, which comes from local law enforcement \u2013 the numbers are preliminary, not all communities submitted data, and the submitted data usually has some initial errors \u2013 so these statistics may not precisely capture the size of the recent declines in crime. But these statistics and other data sources make it clear crime has indeed declined to some extent nationally, though not everywhere. Crime data expert Jeff Asher, co-founder of the firm AH Datalytics, said that if the final 2023 figures show a decline in murder of at least 10% from 2022, this would be the fastest US decline \u201cever recorded.\u201d And he noted that both the preliminary FBI-published data from the first quarter of 2024 and also \u201ccrime data collected from several independent sources point to an even larger decline in property and violent crime, including a substantially larger drop in murder, so far this year compared to 2023, though there is still time left in the year for those trends to change.\u201d From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Scalise claims Biden has \u2018erode\u2019 American \u2018energy dominance\u2019 House Majority Leader Steve Scalise claimed Tuesday in his Republican National Convention speech that the Biden administration has \u201ceroded the American energy dominance that President Trump delivered.\u201d He also claimed that Democrats are waging an \u201cassault on American energy.\u201d Facts First: Scalise\u2019s claims are misleading.\u00a0The US under President Joe Biden is producing more crude oil than any country ever has. The world record was set by the US in 2023, according to the federal Energy Information Administration, averaging about 12.9 million barrels per day \u2013 exceeding the Trump-era record, an average of about 12.3 million barrels per day in 2019. US production of dry natural gas also hit a new high in 2023.\u00a0So did US crude oil exports. CNN\u2019s Matt Egan reported in December that the US was exporting the same amount of crude oil, refined products and natural gas liquids as Saudi Arabia or Russia were producing, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights. None of this is to say that Biden is the reason that domestic oil production has increased; market factors are the key driver of companies\u2019 investment and production decisions, and the Energy Information Administration has credited technological improvements in fracking and horizontal drilling technology that have made oil wells more productive. Egan reported in August: \u201cThe American Petroleum Institute, an oil trade group that has been critical of the Biden administration\u2019s regulatory efforts, noted that approved federal permits and new federal acres leased have both fallen sharply under Biden.\u201d Still, despite Biden\u2019s often-critical rhetoric about fossil fuel companies, some policy moves to get tougher on those companies and his major investments in initiatives to fight climate change, he certainly has not come close to stopping fossil fuel production as Trump has claimed. Biden has also approved some significant and controversial fossil fuel projects, including the Willow oil drilling project in Alaska and the Mountain Valley gas pipeline from West Virginia to Virginia. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale and Piper Hudspeth Blackburn\u00a0 Scalise on migrants coming to the US Scalise said Tuesday that migrants are arriving in the US after having been deliberately freed from prison. \u201cOn the border, Biden and Harris opened it up to the entire world. Prisons are being emptied,\u201d said Scalise,\u00a0a Louisiana Republican. Facts first: There is no evidence for Scalise\u2019s claim that \u201cprisons of being emptied\u201d\u00a0so that prisoners can travel to the US as migrants.  \u201cI do a daily news search to see what\u2019s going on in prisons around the world and have seen absolutely no evidence that any country is emptying its prisons and sending them all to the US,\u201d said Helen Fair, who is co-author of the\u00a0World Prison Population List, which tracks the global prison population, and a research fellow at the Institute for Crime & Justice Policy Research at Birkbeck, University of London. Trump, now the Republican presidential nominee, has repeatedly made such claims in his own speeches and interviews. But Trump has never provided any proof for the claim. Trump\u2019s campaign has provided CNN with only a vague 2022 article from right-wing website Breitbart\u00a0about a supposed federal intelligence report warning Border Patrol agents about Venezuela freeing violent prisoners who had then joined migrant caravans. But this supposed claim about Venezuela\u2019s actions has never been corroborated, and experts have told CNN, PolitiFact and FactCheck.org that they know of no proof of any such thing having happened. The recorded global prison population increased from October 2021 to April 2024, from about 10.77 million people to about 10.99 million people, according to the World Prison Population List. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale\u00a0 Lara Trump\u2019s claims about unemployment records under Trump Lara Trump, the co-chair of the Republican National Committee and the former president\u2019s daughter-in-law, hailed the state of the country during the Trump administration. Among other things, she said there were \u201crecord low unemployment rates for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans and women.\u201d Facts First: These claims need context. Lara Trump didn\u2019t mention that the Trump-era record lows for African American unemployment, Hispanic Americans unemployment and women\u2019s unemployment were all beaten or matched during President Joe Biden\u2019s presidency, though the Trump-era record for Asian American unemployment still stands. The current record low for the Black or African American unemployment rate, 4.8%, was\u00a0set under Biden in April 2023.That beat the Trump-era low that was a record at the time, 5.3% in August 2019 and September 2019. (A cautionary note: This official data series goes back only to 1972.) The Hispanic or Latino unemployment rate hit 3.9% under Biden in September 2022, tying the record low first set in 2019 under Trump. The unemployment rate among women hit 3.4% under Trump in September 2019 and October 2019, the lowest since the 1950s, but it fell to 3.3% under Biden in January 2023. The record set under Trump for Asian American unemployment, 2% in June 2019, has not been matched under Biden. The lowest Biden-era rate was 2.3% in July 2023. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale Rep. Stefanik claims that Biden presidency has led to the highest inflation of her lifetime Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York claimed in her Republican National Convention speech Tuesday that Biden\u2019s presidency has led to the \u201chighest rate of inflation\u201d in her lifetime. Facts First: This claim is out of date.  While the year-over-year inflation rate in June 2022, about 9.1%, was the highest since late 1981,\u00a0inflation has declined sharply since that Biden-era peak, and the most recent available rate, for June 2024, was about 3%. That rate was exceeded as recently as 2011.Stefanik was born in 1984. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale and Piper Hudspeth Blackburn\u00a0 Wisconsin Senate candidate exaggerates the numbers of fentanyl deaths Eric Hovde, the Republican running for Senate in Wisconsin, claimed in his RNC speech Tuesday that the Biden administration \u201cemboldened drug cartels to flood our streets with fentanyl killing over 100,000 Americans every year\u201d by opening the country\u2019s southern border and allowing \u201ccriminals and terrorists to enter the country.\u201d Facts First: It\u2019s a significant exaggeration that fentanyl kills more than 100,000 Americans every year due to the country\u2019s \u201copen\u201d borders. The number of overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids in 2023, including fentanyl, was approximately 75,000, according to estimated and provisional data.\u00a0 The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said\u00a0in May\u00a0that roughly 107,500 people in the US died from a drug overdose, but that is the total number of people who died from an overdose from any kind of drug. Synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, were involved in the majority of those fatalities, making up nearly 70% of overdose deaths in 2023, but they did not account for all of them. In fact, compared with 2022, there were around 1,500 fewer overdose deaths involving fentanyl and other synthetic opioids in 2023. The estimated number of deaths involving cocaine and psychostimulants such as methamphetamines increased in 2023. Specifically, in 2023, there were 74,702 deaths from synthetic opioids, and most of those deaths were from fentanyl. By comparison, in 2022 the estimated number was 76,226, according to the CDC. It is also worth noting that fentanyl is\u00a0largely\u00a0smuggled by US citizens\u00a0through legal ports of entry,\u00a0rather than by migrants sneaking into the country. Contrary to frequent claims by Republicans, the border is not \u201copen\u201d; border officers have seized\u00a0an increasing amount of illicit fentanyl, numbering in the hundreds of millions of pills, under Biden. From CNN\u2019s Jen Christensen Trump makes false claims about election fraud in RNC video\u00a0 For the second consecutive night, the Republican National Convention played a video in which Trump urged Republicans to use \u201cevery appropriate tool available to beat the Democrats,\u201d including voting by mail.\u00a0Trump\u00a0relentlessly disparaged\u00a0mail-in voting during the 2020 election, falsely claiming it was rife with fraud, and he has\u00a0continued to sharply criticize\u00a0it during the current campaign But Trump\u2019s comments in the convention video also included some of his regular false claims about elections. After claiming he would \u201conce and for all secure our elections\u201d as president, Trump again insinuated the 2020 election was not secure, saying, \u201cWe never want what happened in 2020 to happen again.\u201d And he said, \u201cKeep your eyes open, because these people want to cheat and they do cheat, and frankly, it\u2019s the only thing they do well.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claims are nonsense \u2013 slightly vaguer versions of his\u00a0usual lies that the 2020 election was rigged\u00a0and\u00a0stolen\u00a0and\u00a0that Democrats\u00a0are serial election cheaters.\u00a0The\u00a02020 election was highly secure; Trump lost fair and square to Joe Biden by an Electoral College margin of 306 to 232; there is no evidence of voter fraud even close to widespread enough to have changed the outcome in any state; and there is no basis for claiming that election cheating is the only thing at which Trump\u2019s opponents excel. The Trump administration\u2019s\u00a0Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, part of the Department of Homeland Security,\u00a0said\u00a0in a post-election November 2020 statement: \u201cThe November 3rd election was the most secure in American history.\u201d From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale\u00a0 Kari Lake on her opponent\u2019s record about voting laws Kari Lake said Tuesday that Democratic Arizona Rep. Ruben Gallego, her likely opponent in the state\u2019s US Senate race this fall, voted last week to let undocumented immigrants \u201cillegally cast a ballot in this upcoming election.\u201d \u201cThese guys are full, they\u2019re full of bad ideas,\u201d Lake said in her speech. \u201cJust last week Ruben Gallego voted to let the millions of people who poured into our country illegally cast a ballot in this upcoming election.\u201d Fact First:\u00a0This claim is false. The House did not vote on whether to allow noncitizens to vote. The chamber\u00a0passed a bill on July 10\u00a0that would require documentary proof of US citizenship to register to vote in federal elections. Gallego voted against the legislation, which is not expected to be taken up by the Democratic-controlled Senate. It is already illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal elections, and\u00a0experts say it rarely occurs. When people register to vote, they must provide a driver\u2019s license or Social Security number, and their identity is checked against existing databases. Voters are required to swear under penalty of perjury that they are a US citizen.\u00a0Noncitizens who vote illegally can face imprisonment or deportation. Gallego\u00a0said in a statement\u00a0that he opposed the bill because its \u201conly purpose is to disenfranchise tens of thousands of Arizonans, and I will not vote to take away the rights of Arizonans to stop something that is already illegal.\u201d \u201cOf course, only U.S. citizens should vote,\u201d said Gallego. \u201cBut this bill isn\u2019t about that, it\u2019s about making it harder for Arizonans to vote, including married women, servicemembers, Native Arizonans, seniors, and people with disabilities.\u201d From CNN\u2019s Piper Hudspeth Blackburn Perry Johnson\u2019s incorrect claim about median family income Perry Johnson, a Michigan business owner who previously ran for governor and president, said Tuesday that income rose consistently under Trump. \u201cUnder Trump, family income went up every year. That is a fact,\u201d Johnson told the crowd. Facts first: Johnson is incorrect. Median family income fell in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic in both inflation-adjusted and non-adjusted terms. Typical family income grew by several thousand dollars during each of Trump\u2019s first three years in office, before adjusting for inflation. But it fell by $1,660 in 2020, when the pandemic wreaked havoc on the US economy. After factoring in inflation, typical family income fell by nearly $2,900 in 2020, after rising in each of the first three years of Trump\u2019s administration.

But it wasn\u2019t Ohio Sen. JD Vance\u2019s name alone that elicited the reaction for the founder of the\u00a0Republican Hindu Coalition\u00a0and the chair of the\u00a0Hindu and Indian Coalition\u00a0of the Republican National Committee. It was Vance\u2019s wife, Usha, a 38-year-old Yale graduate and the daughter of Indian immigrants. \u201cHindus have come a long way,\u201d Kumar said, noting the growth of their population and political power since he moved to the United States in the late \u201860s. \u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d he said, adding the Vances \u201care going to represent a new generation of Americans.\u201d The 2024 presidential campaign has seen three politicians of South Asian descent vying for the White House: Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy both competed during the Republican primaries, while Vice President Kamala Harris is running for a second term with President Joe Biden. On the second night of the convention, both Haley and Ramaswamy unequivocally backed the Trump-Vance ticket during prime-time speeches at the Republican National Convention. And Wednesday night, Usha Vance will introduce her husband as Trump\u2019s running mate in a speech that marks her first official move as a member of the Trump-Vance campaign. As Asian Americans take a more central role in the 2024 presidential campaign, political activists from both parties say they hope the increase in representation will correspond with a push to connect with a voting bloc that has long been overlooked. The fastest-growing voting bloc The increase in South Asian representation in politics is \u201cphenomenal,\u201d said Chintan Patel, executive director of Indian American Impact, a national organization that works to increase representation and civic engagement among Indian and South Asian communities. \u201cSince Impact was founded in 2016, representation within South Asian communities went from approximately 50 elected officials to more than 300 nationwide, including obviously the vice president of the United States Kamala Harris,\u201d Patel told CNN. That representation, Patel added, is key because \u201cit helps reimagine what\u2019s possible for our community.\u201d Trump campaign sources tell CNN they think Usha Vance could appeal to minority voters. Asian Americans are the fastest-growing racial or ethnic group of eligible voters in the United States, according to a recent analysis by Pew Research Center. Since 2020, according to Pew, the number of eligible Asian American voters has increased by 2 million \u2013 roughly the population of Nebraska. But despite their growing electoral power, both parties need to do more to engage with this critical voting bloc, said Christine Chen, executive director of APIAVote, a nonpartisan group dedicated to empowering Asian American and Pacific Islander voters. \u201cHeading into this cycle, we believe that the scars of 2020, in terms of what we experienced with the rise of anti-Asian hate as well as dealing with the pandemic, that everyone understands the role that elected officials play and the importance of us casting our vote,\u201d Chen said. \u201cWe\u2019re also trying to reemphasize to the campaigns and the parties that they really need to do a better job in terms of reaching out to our growing base of (the) electorate, but also doing it early.\u201d Last week, APIAVote, in collaboration with AAPI Data, Asian Americans Advancing Justice and the AARP  released\u00a0the 2024 Asian American Voter Survey, a survey of the key issues driving Asian American voters this election cycle. While 90% of Asian American voters surveyed said they plan to vote for president, Congress and other offices this November, the survey also notes that half said they have not been contacted by the Democratic Party, and 57% said the same of Republicans. \u201cThis is disturbing because this has consistently been the case cycle and after cycle,\u201d Chen said. That\u00a0lack of outreach, she said, has the potential to swing elections in battleground states like Georgia, where APIAVote\u2019s data shows the number of eligible Asian American voters exceeds the margin of victory in 2020. The key issues for Asian American voters But, Patel said, like every voting bloc,\u00a0the powerful symbol that representation brings also has to be married with substance and commitment to the issues that matter to Asian American voters. According to the Asian American voter survey, the economy, education, inflation and immigration were \u201chighly important\u201d for Asian Americans this election cycle. Kumar said immigration is top of mind for many South Asian Republican voters because of the backlog facing millions of Hindu and Indian Americans who are waiting for green cards. And while they differ politically, Patel said his organization has heard from many progressive Indian American voters who are also concerned about immigration, particularly the plans outlined in Project 2025 \u2013 the conservative blueprint for the next Republican president \u2013 that call for mass deportations. Chen said the work must continue to engage with Asian American voters \u2013 many of whom are immigrant, first-time voters \u2013 to understand the key role they could play in the upcoming election. \u201cIt\u2019s actually for us to protect a democracy,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cEveryone needs to participate. It\u2019s no longer a democracy if only a few participate in the election process.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/politics/south-asians-representation-usha-vance-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_politics_takeaways-rnc-day-2", "text": "Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, in her speech to the Republican National Convention on Tuesday, cheered America\u2019s\u00a0\u201cincredible ability to self-correct.\u201d Haley, so recently a political rival and fierce critic of former President Donald Trump, might have been talking about herself. On the second night of the convention in Milwaukee, less than 24 hours after a top union leader denounced corporate America in the same hall, Haley executed a stark about-face, pledging her support to Trump and asking others who had expressed similar concerns about his potential return to power to consider the alternative: President Joe Biden. Other speakers, such as Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump and grief-stricken parents telling their own families\u2019 agonizing stories, offered more poignant messages as the GOP and Trump\u2019s campaign tried again to sand off the former president\u2019s rough edges. \u201cI will start by making one thing perfectly clear: Donald Trump has my strong endorsement. Period,\u201d Haley said at the beginning of her speech \u2013 dispelling any remaining suggestions to the contrary and, in the moment, warming up a crowd that had greeted her coolly. Haley\u2019s speech, delivered a night after Trump was formally nominated, firmly closed the door on whatever remains of the dissent that hung over parts of the 2024 GOP primary campaign.\u00a0But if\u00a0she\u00a0was trying to thread a needle, backing Trump the candidate without endorsing all his ideas, she was the exception. The other speakers were unanimously loyal to the former president, describing him as a self-sacrificial leader who, while in office, took America to its greatest heights only to see his work undone by Biden\u2019s feckless presidency. Former foes lined up to sing Trump\u2019s praises, admit the error of their ways and tell voters that the halcyon days of Trump\u2019s first term would seem mild compared with the promise of another. Here are five takeaways from the second night of the Republican convention: Haley gets on board Haley took the stage, at the invitation of Trump, to\u00a0a\u00a0mix of cheers and jeers. She quickly set about to win over the faithful. First, she offered a full endorsement and then, nodding to their occasionally nasty, if one-sided, primary fight, issued a \u201csimple\u201d message. \u201cYou don\u2019t have agree with Donald Trump 100% of the time to vote for him,\u201d Haley said. \u201cTake it from me.\u201d In\u00a0the 2024 primary,\u00a0Haley\u00a0consistently scored above 20% among GOP voters \u2013 and won two contests \u2013 underscoring Trump\u2019s lingering issues with moderate, suburban Republicans. On Tuesday, Haley said she was speaking to them \u2013 the fence-sitters. \u201cFor the sake of our nation, we have to go with Donald Trump,\u201d Haley said, a little before telling delegates, \u201cI\u2019m here tonight because we have a country to save.\u201d She also took repeated jabs at Vice President Kamala Harris, a crowd-pleasing venture, and spoke, with gusto, about Trump\u2019s foreign policy chops\u00a0and cheered his worldview. Haley would know, of course, having served as Trump\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations for two years. Her takeaway from that time? \u201cHe appreciated advice and input,\u201d she said Tuesday. The (other) ring kissers It was not only Haley who used the occasion to ask for a kind of forgiveness from Trump and the Republican base. Other onetime rivals, such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, whose primary campaign fizzled out shortly after voting began, also kissed Trump\u2019s ring. They includedVivek Ramaswamy, former Housing and Urban Development secretary Ben Carson, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (whose 2016 run opposing Trump was endorsed by Haley) and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. \u201cDonald Trump is the president who will actually unite this country,\u201d Ramaswamy said. Cruz, who told a similar audience to \u201cvote your conscience\u201d at the 2016 RNC, focused most of his remarks on the \u201cliteral invasion\u201d of undocumented migrants at the southern border and, as he put it, on speaking up for young women who had been victimized by those immigrants. DeSantis also applauded Trump, but mostly used his time to warn against reelecting Biden, whom he described as a \u201ctool for a leftist agenda.\u201d \u201cAmerica,\u201d the Florida governor insisted, \u201ccannot afford four more years of a \u2018Weekend at Bernie\u2019s\u2019 presidency.\u201d Christie and the \u2018unity\u2019 brigade vs. RNC speakers Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie long ago evolved from a top Trump ally to one of the former president\u2019s most vocal Republican critics. On Tuesday, just as a night of RNC speeches filled with calls for unity got underway, he dropped a bombshell op-ed in\u00a0The New York Times,\u00a0calling Trump\u2019s early attempts to \u201crein in some of the worst rhetorical impulses\u201d in their party \u201cless than promising.\u201d \u201cIt is not enough for this to be only a momentary call for unity,\u201d Christie wrote. \u201cThis change has to go beyond this week, next month and the November elections to be a real transformational shift. Otherwise, all we are left with is just another fleeting political moment.\u201d Others, on the convention floor and outside the venue, have preached unity and rapprochement. Not just within the Republican Party, they insisted, but across the board, among an increasingly sick and angry body politic. The heinous attempt on Trump\u2019s life this past weekend in Pennsylvania, Republicans agreed, meant it was time for everyone to turn down the temperature. That memo reached many of the night\u2019s speakers \u2013 but not all. Kari Lake, the hard-line conservative candidate for Senate in Arizona, falsely claimed that her Democratic opponent, Rep. Ruben Gallego, \u201cvoted to let the millions of people who poured into our country illegally cast a ballot in this upcoming election.\u201d She also attacked the media, per usual, for lying \u201cabout everything.\u201d Republican Eric Hovde, who is running for Senate here in Wisconsin, embraced a similar theme, accusing the media of \u201cdividing us.\u201d \u201cThe bottom line to why we are here,\u201d said West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, another Senate candidate, \u201cthe bottom line to every single thing that\u2019s going on in this great country today is one thing: We become totally unhinged if Donald Trump is not elected in November.\u201d Down-ballot candidates and leaders make their cases Several Republican candidates in key House and Senate races made their own cases Tuesday night \u2014 with a range of approaches, from Lake\u2019s combative words to Pennsylvania Senate contender Dave McCormick\u2019s call for unity. House Republican Majority Leader Steve Scalise, in a battle to keep his party\u2019s narrow majority, used six words, over and over, to make his point: \u201cPresident Trump and the Republican majority \u2026\u201d None of what he said after, Scalise implied, would matter if the first two parts weren\u2019t secured. Lake began her speech by calling out what she called \u201cthe fake news\u201d and \u201cdisastrous Democrat policies.\u201d Hovde followed up Lake by continuing to blame news organizations for national divisions, saying that the media has to \u201cstop dividing us.\u201d \u201cWe need to heal this country from the division that the left has brought,\u201d he said in his speech. McCormick, meanwhile, talked of being in the front row Saturday at Trump\u2019s Butler, Pennsylvania, rally, where a gunman attempted to assassinate the former president. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins afterward, McCormick said Americans need to \u201cmake sure that we\u2019re not talking in ways that dehumanizes people and ultimately contributes to an environment where violence is going to happen.\u201d Collins then asked about Lake\u2019s comments. \u201cI\u2019m only worried about myself. I wasn\u2019t watching anybody else,\u201d McCormick said. Family programming Lara Trump, the former president\u2019s daughter-in-law and co-chair of the national party, closed out the festivities with a tribute to the nominee and the makings of an olive branch to Trump-curious Democrats and independents. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to love everything he tweeted,\u201d she said of the former president, \u201cbut you cannot deny you were better off when Donald Trump was in office.\u201d Her address was also a reprise of sorts of the 2016 GOP convention, when Trump\u2019s children all gave speeches attesting to their father\u2019s good humor and self-sacrifice. She accused Democrats of trying to fear-monger about a second Trump term, an implicit reference to concerns over the Heritage Foundation-led \u201cProject 2025\u201d manifesto. And she spoke, emotionally, about the attempt on her father-in-law\u2019s life this past weekend. The scene had emotionally scarred her and her children, Lara Trump said, but also brought out the best in America, which came together in horror over the shooting. \u201cMaybe you got to see a side of Donald Trump on Saturday,\u201d she said of his triumphal response to the would-be assassin\u2019s near-miss, \u201cthat you didn\u2019t know existed until you saw it with your own eyes.\u201d \u201cHe is a lion,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is bold, he is strong, he is fearless \u2013 and he is exactly what this country needs right now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/takeaways-rnc-day-2/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_politics_joe-biden-polling", "text": "Joe Biden just made a false statement about his current polling position. He told BET that \u201cpresidents who have won at this stage of the game, the last seven or eight presidents, five of them were losing at this time by significant margins.\u201d A look at history, however, shows no such thing. Instead, it reveals that Biden is in a weak position for an incumbent president, and incumbents who are trailing at this point in the campaign rarely come back to win. It\u2019s not entirely clear whether Biden was referring to sitting presidents (i.e., counting only races with incumbents) or future presidents (i.e., counting all presidential races). Either way, his statement doesn\u2019t hold water. Let\u2019s talk about incumbents first. I went back and looked at all available polling data from the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research (from 1940 to 2020) and Gallup (for 1936). This includes 15 presidential races that featured incumbents. Just two incumbents (George W. Bush in 2004 and Harry Truman in 1948) were trailing by any margin at this point in the campaign and came back to win. That\u2019s a far cry from five of the last seven or eight presidents, as Biden put it to BET. Of the past eight incumbents who ran for reelection, five faced a deficit in the average of polls at this point. Four of them lost \u2014 Trump in 2020, George H.W. Bush in 1992, Jimmy Carter in 1980 and Gerald Ford in 1976. Only George W. Bush was down at this stage in 2004 and went on to win. Incumbents such as Barack Obama in 2012, Bill Clinton in 1996 and Ronald Reagan in 1984 were all ahead by now. All would be reelected. Indeed, the track record for incumbents who were leading at this point in their campaigns is strong \u2014 and since 1936, all of them emerged victorious. Biden, though, may not just have been referring to incumbents. He may have been including future presidents too. Open races, in which the candidates are often less well known, tend to be more unpredictable. In this case, though, Biden\u2019s statement is still wrong. The candidate leading at this point in the campaign has won six of the past eight presidential elections. Trump in 2016 and George W. Bush in 2004 were the exceptions. (Note: I\u2019m talking about winning the election, not the popular vote. Though if we\u2019re examining the popular vote, it would still remain six out of eight because while the 2016 polls at this point would have predicted the correct popular vote winner, the 2000 polls would not.) For the purposes of understanding the depth of Biden\u2019s problem, we can go back even further. Although Biden didn\u2019t say this himself, I was interested to see, going back to 1936, how often a candidate trailed by a significant margin just before the party conventions but went on to win. You can find others who were doing worse than Biden is right now and won. George H.W. Bush was losing in 1988 to Michael Dukakis. Richard Nixon was down to Hubert Humphrey in 1968. Add those to Trump in 2016 and Truman in 1948, and you get four examples of candidates who were trailing at this point by at least as much as Biden is currently and went on to win. Still, that\u2019s not the five Biden said, and we\u2019ve widened the sample size to more than double what he mentioned in his BET interview. You can get to five if you include George W. Bush, whose deficit in 2004 was not as bad as Biden\u2019s. Biden is behind by about 3 points or worse in the swing states, while Bush was down by 1 to 2 points nationally. A 5 out of 21 (23%) chance of victory isn\u2019t where an incumbent president wants to be right now. Lastly, I\u2019ll note that if we focus solely on races in which presidents were seeking reelection, we can see what Biden\u2019s real problem is. He\u2019s an incumbent with an approval rating south of 40% and a disapproval rating north of 50%. There have been other incumbents running for reelection with similarly bad numbers \u2014 Carter in 1980 and George H.W. Bush in 1992. Both lost, and not by small margins. Ironically, the best hope for Biden is the example of Trump, who was down at this point in 2020 by far more than Biden is now. Trump had an approval rating right at 40% (so not significantly better than Biden\u2019s current numbers) and a disapproval rating well above 50%. Trump ended up barely losing in the pivotal battleground states. Now this Trump example doesn\u2019t make Biden\u2019s remark about the polls to BET somehow true. No matter how you look at it, his statement is incorrect. Perhaps more worrisome is it\u2019s not the first time Biden has tried to diagnose his polling in public in a way that is at best misleading. He did so during his news conference last week, when he said, \u201cThere are at least five presidents running or incumbent presidents who had lower numbers than I have now.\u201d While he seemed to give himself a little more wiggle room than he did in his BET interview, the idea he is trying to push \u2014 that plenty of people in his position have come back to win \u2014 is a constant theme. But it gives his supporters false hope. While I wouldn\u2019t consider his prospects dire \u2014 a Biden victory is possible \u2014 the president is in quite a bad place polling-wise.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/joe-biden-polling/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_politics_republican-senate-candidates-rnc-convention", "text": "The excitement at the Republican National Convention isn\u2019t just about Donald Trump and his new running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance \u2013 it also extends to Senate candidates who the party believes can help deliver the former president a GOP majority on Capitol Hill. While Democrats in competitive Senate races have largely been overperforming President Joe Biden in polling so far this year, Republicans are hopeful that that movement in favor of Trump at the top of the ticket will close those gaps and potentially expand this year\u2019s playing field. That was reflected in the roster of candidates speaking Tuesday night, which included Hung Cao, the GOP Senate nominee in Virginia, a state Biden won by 10 points in 2020. Besides Virginia \u2013 which New York Times/Siena College polling out this week showed to be a margin-of-error presidential race \u2013 Republicans are also eyeing the Senate race in New Mexico, a state Biden carried by 11 points. Montana Sen. Steve Daines, the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, specifically touted New Mexico GOP nominee Nella Domenici, the daughter of the late Sen. Pete Domenici, at a CNN-Politico Grill event in Milwaukee on Monday. Polling conducted by the NRSC and Domenici\u2019s campaign last month showed her in a margin-of-error race with Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich. Democrats, however, don\u2019t see trouble signs for their incumbents in those states. \u201cWhile Democrats are taking nothing for granted, New Mexico and Virginia have elected Democrats to the US Senate for over a decade and will do so again this cycle,\u201d said a national Democrat working on Senate races. Republicans need to pick up just one or two seats to flip the Senate, depending on who wins the White House. And with Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin retiring from deep-red West Virginia, they\u2019re likely to get at least one of those. The top three seats on CNN\u2019s ranking of the Senate seats most likely to flip have consistently been in states Trump twice won comfortably, followed by presidential battlegrounds. Maryland, which backed Biden by more than 30 points, joined the list of GOP targets after former two-term Gov. Larry Hogan entered the race. But the popular Republican, who has made clear he isn\u2019t supporting Trump despite having the former president\u2019s support, was unsurprisingly not onstage Tuesday night. Election observers don\u2019t see improving numbers for Trump drastically changing a map that already favored his party. \u201cIt expands the map for Republicans at the very margin of the battlefield. But the status quo was already a pretty expansive list of opportunities for Republicans,\u201d Jacob Rubashkin, deputy editor of Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales, told CNN, arguing that New Mexico is a more realistic takeover opportunity for Senate Republicans than Virginia. Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez\u2019s conviction Tuesday in his federal corruption trial \u2013 and his colleagues\u2019 calls for him to step down \u2013 has put a fresh spotlight on New Jersey, where Democratic Rep. Andy Kim has a strong path to election in a state that backed Biden by 16 points in 2020. There\u2019s still the possibility Menendez could run as an independent and split the Democratic vote, but Rubashkin doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s a big threat to Democrats. \u201cThe reality was that (Menendez) was so unpopular in the state by the time the verdict came down that any support he would have gotten would not have complicated Andy Kim\u2019s path in a major way,\u201d he said. While the Senate landscape unquestionably benefits Republicans, some of the most vulnerable Senate Democratic incumbents have leaned on strong brands in their states and fundraising advantages to create separation from Biden. Republicans recruited a large crop of wealthy candidates, many of them businessmen, to run this year. But that hasn\u2019t yet closed Democrats\u2019 fundraising edge, and it\u2019s fueled Democratic attacks on the Republican candidates\u2019 business ties and out-of-state connections. Daines argued Monday that polling from this spring and early summer won\u2019t reflect what happens in November, suggesting that lower-propensity voters who support Trump will turn out this year in a way they did not during the 2022 midterms. Daines said the NRSC halted its polling on Saturday after the assassination attempt on Trump to let things \u201ccool off a bit.\u201d There\u2019s been limited public polling \u2013 especially of Senate races \u2013 since last month\u2019s presidential debate. Since the debate, some GOP Senate candidates have run ads questioning Biden\u2019s mental fitness for office, trying to pressure Democratic incumbents into answering whether he\u2019s fit to serve. But Daines said this week that the president\u2019s policies, rather than his acuity, should be the focus. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to talk about President Biden\u2019s mental acuity,\u201d Daines told Politico\u2019s Rachael Bade during the CNN-Politico Grill interview, reflecting the shift in Republican messaging that was largely seen onstage Monday during night one of the RNC. But while most Senate GOP candidates didn\u2019t directly go after Biden\u2019s age and mental acuity Tuesday, they didn\u2019t all adhere to the unity message the party attempted to project a night earlier. Arizona\u2019s Kari Lake, who is all but certain to win this month\u2019s GOP primary, opened the Senate portion of the programming by blaming the media for divisions in America. \u201cActually, I don\u2019t welcome everyone,\u201d she said to the crowded convention hall, pointing her finger up at what she said was the \u201cfake news.\u201d Lake \u2013 who is expected to face Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego in a state that Biden flipped in 2020 but that will be tough for him to hold this year \u2013 set the tone by attacking what she called \u201cBiden\u2019s invasion.\u201d The US southern border has been a central theme in GOP Senate campaign messaging this cycle, even in states that are hundreds of miles from Mexico. Banking executive Eric Hovde, who\u2019s challenging Sen. Tammy Baldwin in the convention\u2019s home state of Wisconsin, blamed Democrats for the fentanyl crisis. He then pivoted to lamenting the divisions in the country and calling for Americans to take off their \u201cred and blue jerseys.\u201d But, like Lake, Hovde went after the media \u2013 which went over well among the Trump delegates in the audience. \u201cThe media, you have to stop dividing us,\u201d he said. Former House Intelligence Chairman Mike Rogers, who\u2019s running to flip Michigan\u2019s open Senate seat, blamed Biden for inflation and bashed the president\u2019s electric vehicle policies. He also picked up on the law-and-order message and snuck in a rare reference to \u201cnap time\u201d at the White House in another dig at Biden. Among the other Republicans in top-tier races on stage Tuesday night was businessman Tim Sheehy, who is taking on the most vulnerable Senate incumbent running for reelection \u2013 Montana Sen. Jon Tester. \u201cThe world is on fire under Joe Biden,\u201d said Sheehy, who talked up his military service. Army veteran Sam Brown, who\u2019s challenging first-term Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen in Nevada, also leaned into his military service. Another veteran, Pennsylvania\u2019s\u00a0Dave McCormick, addressed the weekend assassination attempt against Trump. McCormick was in the front row at Saturday\u2019s rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. He cast Democratic Sen. Bob Casey as a career politician, tying him to Biden and arguing that the election presented a choice between \u201cgreatness and decline.\u201d Ohio businessman Bernie Moreno, whom Democrats boosted in the GOP primary because they thought he\u2019d be the weakest challenger to Sen. Sherrod Brown, invoked the most famous Ohioan at this week\u2019s convention. Vance, the state\u2019s junior senator, also backed Moreno in the primary and pushed Trump to do the same. Cao, the GOP nominee in Virginia, also referred to a more famous politician to explain his race to the convention crowd. \u201cI\u2019m running against Hillary\u2019s running mate, Tim Kaine,\u201d he said. And in the race for the seat that\u2019s most likely to flip this year, West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a former Democrat, touted his close friendship with the Trump family But the real start of the show was sitting on a leather chair beside him. Babydog, Justice\u2019s English bulldog, is projecting a GOP victory, the governor said.

{"id": "2024_07_16_politics_trump-return-rnc-analysis", "text": "Donald Trump has gone from an insurrection to a resurrection. The searing picture of a nation in dystopian decline that defines the ex-president\u2019s politics was largely missing on the first night of the Republican National Convention. In its place was a sense of the divine \u2014 a pulsating belief in miracles among thousands of Republican delegates and a feeling that God spared their hero after he was nearly killed in an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania on Saturday. Thousands of Trump supporters in Milwaukee on Monday night hailed their leader, elevating him from MAGA superhero to saint-like status. Trump, a white bandage over his wounded right ear, stood below the stands of the Milwaukee Bucks NBA arena, like a heavyweight boxer waiting to climb into the ring in a title fight. The crowd cheered as his face suddenly appeared on a giant screen. Then he walked deliberately into the spotlight \u2014 raising his fist, in an electric political moment before slowly ascending to the VIP box to greet his new vice presidential pick, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio. Trump didn\u2019t speak to the crowd, but mouthed \u201cthank you\u201d over and over again. Usually, Trump\u2019s face projects anger or rage or sarcasm. But on Monday night, it wore unusual emotion. It looked as if tears welled in Trump\u2019s eyes. A man who normally projects strength and seeks to dominant every room he enters betrayed a trace of wistfulness and vulnerability, as might befit someone coming to terms with their life being saved by a stroke of luck and a turn of the head. \u2018The devil \u2026 holding a rifle\u2019 Trump\u2019s supporters have long seen him as a God-like figure and his own campaign has played into the trope with advertising. He\u2019s styled himself as the secular prophet who leads a populist movement. For Trump\u2019s millions of American fans, Monday night was a validation of their faith in God and the ex-president and the righteousness of his mission. \u201cOn Saturday, the devil came to Pennsylvania holding a rifle. But an American lion got back on his feet and he roared!\u201d said South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, who reached for a preacher\u2019s cadence and was among many speakers who argued that Providence had saved Trump so he could save America. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem also sanctified the ex-president following his brush with death. \u201cWe already knew that President Donald Trump is fighter. He is the toughest man that I have ever met,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody has endured more than what he has gone through. They\u2019ve attacked his reputation, they impeached him, they tried to bankrupt him, and they unjustly prosecuted him. But even in the most perilous moment this week, his instinct was to stand and to fight.\u201d Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene \u2013 one of the rare speakers who broke from the unity message \u2013 said,\u00a0\u201cI thank God that his hand was on President Trump.\u201d The ex-president\u2019s escape spared the country another of the unfathomable political tragedies that have scared its history. Two pictures of Trump But where some voters see Trump as a messiah-like figure, others see a cult. Where some see inspiration, others sense demagoguery. And the veneration of Trump as a sort-of quasi-religious figure will cause deep fear given that he has made no secret of his authoritarian streak and a desire for retribution against his enemies if he wins a second term. That threat has taken on new relevance in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent ruling that expanded presidential immunity. This unbridgeable national estrangement over the 45th president encapsulates the political divide that is deepening in America, which means calls for unity and a cooling of political rhetoric, while welcome, are unlikely to be sustained in the long term. After all, Trump\u2019s triumphant appearance on the day the Republican convention made him its nominee marked the official embrace of a figure who tried to destroy American democracy to stay in office after losing the 2020 election. This was the same man who summoned a mob to Washington on January 6, 2021, and told supporters to \u201cfight like Hell\u201d before they invaded the US Capitol, beat up police and tried to thwart the certification of President Joe Biden\u2019s election victory. These jarring and dueling perspectives toward Trump are one reason why it will be hard for many Americans to buy into Trump\u2019s assurance about he\u2019d now try to heal a polarized nation. The former president insisted in an interview with the Washington Examiner on Sunday that his perspective had changed after he survived the shooting, implying that he\u2019d desist from using a political technique that relies on tearing at societal, cultural and racial divides. \u201cThis is a chance to bring the whole country, even the whole world, together.\u201d Multiple times during his administration,\u00a0pundits declared at a moment of national emergency that Trump had changed and \u201cpivoted\u201d to being presidential. But the ex-president did as much as anyone to foment the toxic political culture that is more intense now than at any time since the 1960s and which many political leaders blame for Saturday\u2019s assassination attempt and other political violence. Until he proves otherwise, voters might give the ex-president a hearing for any tempered tone given the horror of what unfolded in Pennsylvania, when Trump survived but a rally goer \u2014 father, fisherman and fireman Corey Comperatore \u2014 was killed while shielding his family. Old habits die hard Almost every Republican speaker got the memo Monday \u2014 that instead of Trump\u2019s normal characterization of a nation under siege from rampant crime, invading migrants and far left ideology, the prime-time picture was one of unity and inclusion. A list of Black Republican and female Republican lawmakers gave speeches, offering a somewhat misleading perception that the GOP has a deep and diverse bench. One GOP source said speechwriters at the convention had thrown out all their pre-written material for the week\u2019s top speakers and started again. Only Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson struck a discordant note as his old speech was loaded into the teleprompter and he went on a tear about how \u201ctoday\u2019s Democrat agenda, their policies are a clear and present danger to America, to our institutions, to our values and our people.\u201d But there were earlier signs that the new sunny face of Trump\u2019s post-assassination GOP went only so far. The president\u2019s selection of Vance elevated one of the most fervent proponents of MAGA rhetoric. The Ohio senator responded in the aftermath of Saturday\u2019s shooting with one of the most discordant statements at a time when politicians on all sides were trying to calm a traumatized nation. \u201cThe central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs,\u201d Vance wrote on X. \u201cThat rhetoric led directly to President Trump\u2019s attempted assassination.\u201d The assassination attempt aside, Trump came into the convention on a roll, leading in most of the polls, well positioned in battleground state and profiting from the aftermath of Biden\u2019s disastrous debate performance last month. He got another monumental win on Monday when Florida Judge Aileen Cannon threw out special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s classified documents case in a move that cemented the emerging reality that the ex-president may never be held accountable for his multiple alleged transgressions against the rule of law, apart from in his conviction in his hush money trial in New York. The reaction of Trump and his allies was just as misleading, angry and injurious to vital democratic institutions of accountability as it has always been. \u201cAs we move forward in Uniting our Nation after the horrific events on Saturday, this dismissal of the Lawless Indictment in Florida should be just the first step, followed quickly by the dismissal of ALL the Witch Hunts \u2014 The January 6th Hoax in Washington, D.C., \u2026\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social. \u201cThe Democrat Justice Department coordinated ALL of these Political Attacks, which are an Election Interference conspiracy against Joe Biden\u2019s Political Opponent, ME.\u201d New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, one of Trump\u2019s top supporters on Capitol Hill, accused the Justice Department of trying to \u201cshred the Constitution.\u201d The rhetoric was a sign from some corners of the GOP that national unity is possible only if Trump is handed the right to rule in an unfettered manner shielded from any criminal consequences for his actions. So, while Trump is promising change and a new tone, some old habits die hard. The ex-president has a new chance at politics and life in the wake of his assassination attempt. This week will begin to show how he uses it.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/politics/trump-return-rnc-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_politics_rudy-giuliani-spending", "text": "Rudy\u00a0Giuliani\u00a0has drained roughly half of the money in a personal bank account in the last week to pay for personal expenses, a court proceeding revealed Wednesday, as he\u00a0attends the Republican National Convention while being hounded from afar\u00a0by people to whom he owes millions. The numbers are being publicly revealed now because\u00a0Giuliani\u00a0owes around $350,000 to a forensic accountant who worked on tracing his assets during the bankruptcy, and a federal judge is following up, with growing frustration, on how to get that bill paid. Giuliani\u00a0only appears to have a portion of that amount in his personal bank account, which keeps being depleted to pay\u00a0other bills, Wednesday\u2019s federal court\u00a0proceedings in White Plains, New York, revealed. Giuliani\u00a0has been slow to disclose what cash he has on hand in liquid accounts, and hasn\u2019t been fully transparent, the judge has found. Rachel Strickland, a lawyer for two 2020\u00a0election workers from Georgia to whom Giuliani\u00a0owes nearly $150 million, said in court Wednesday that the former New York City mayor\u00a0is \u201cup to\u00a0Giuliani\u00a0shenanigans yet again.\u201d She told the judge Wednesday afternoon Giuliani\u2019s lawyers had provided new information about one personal bank account, where\u00a0he\u00a0had $60,000 a week ago. But in the last few days, the account went to \u201chalf that much,\u201d Strickland said. She noted a $14,000 check cashed for his New York condo expenses and $25,000 in fees paid related to another condo he owns in Florida. She also said his account showed a wire transfer to a condo association two days ago, small charges for Amazon and Apple, and expenses related to his travels this week to Milwaukee, where the Republican National Convention is taking place. Last Friday,\u00a0Giuliani\u2019s bankruptcy protection ended, and creditors such as the 2020 election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss \u200bare now able to pursue his $10 million net worth. Giuliani\u2019s wealth is primarily in two pieces of real estate he owns, the New York co-op apartment and the condominium in Palm Beach, Florida. While Moss, Freeman and others will be able to try to seize the properties and other personal assets he has, like baseball memorabilia, the bankruptcy judge can still focus on having\u00a0Giuliani\u00a0pay for professional services related to the bankruptcy.\u200b Frustrated judge warns of \u2018bad things\u2019 for\u00a0Giuliani Judge Sean Lane, who is presiding over\u00a0Giuliani\u2019s bankruptcy case, held two hearings on Wednesday to push for a way to get the bankruptcy administrative bills paid. His frustration growing with\u00a0Giuliani\u2019s lack of answers, Lane threatened to force\u00a0Giuliani\u00a0to come to his courtroom and potentially testify. Throughout the bankruptcy proceeding,\u00a0Giuliani\u00a0has only called in to listen over a phone line, while his lawyers are often in Lane\u2019s courtroom in person. Lane told\u00a0Giuliani\u2019s\u00a0lawyers on Wednesday he may consider \u201crequiring your client to come and sit in this witness box \u2026 Does your client want to do that?\u201d Yet Lane said he would wait to decide what to do in a day or so. He told\u00a0Giuliani\u2019s lawyers they had until Thursday at \u201chigh noon; that\u2019s appropriately theatrical\u201d \u200bto notify the court of a plan for\u00a0Giuliani\u00a0to resolve his bills. \u201cIf your client persists in this course of action, there are a lot of bad things that can happen,\u201d Lane told\u00a0Giuliani\u2019s attorneys on Wednesday. \u201cThere are a lot of things your client doesn\u2019t want to happen that will happen. None of this is a surprise.\u201d \u201cThis isn\u2019t complicated nor is it unexpected nor is it unusual. I\u2019m really at a loss. I strongly, strongly urge you and your client to sit down and figure out what you really want the endgame\u00a0to look like,\u201d the judge added. Giuliani flies first class to Milwaukee Giuliani\u2019s bankruptcy attorneys, Heath Berger and Gary Fischoff, said during the court hearing they sometimes had difficulty reaching\u00a0Giuliani\u00a0and needed time. Giuliani\u00a0is currently in Milwaukee, attending the GOP convention, where his former client Donald Trump will formally accept the party\u2019s presidential nomination on Thursday. He flew there on Sunday, with a first-class seat on a Delta flight from New York\u2019s LaGuardia Airport, accompanied by a personal assistant whose plane tickets he has paid for regularly. On Tuesday, he\u00a0told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins\u00a0on the floor of the convention hall he had \u201cno regrets at all,\u201d acknowledged\u00a0that Freeman and Moss were trying to seize everything he owned, and compared his bleak\u00a0situation in the court system to the suffering of Japanese Americans in internment camps during World War II. He later\u00a0tripped, falling across folding chairs to the convention floor. His assistant Ted Goodman said in a statement Wednesday that\u00a0Giuliani\u00a0\u201ctripped over a dip in the walkway\u201d because he was filming video at the same time. Goodman noted\u00a0Giuliani\u2019s \u201cjam-packed schedule, collecting video footage and talking with reporters\u201d and his wish to support his \u201cfriend\u201d Trump.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/rudy-giuliani-spending/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_politics_fact-check-night-3-republican-national-convention", "text": "Night\u00a0three of the Republican National Convention has kicked off in Milwaukee. CNN\u2019s Facts First team is fact checking the convention and will update this page throughout the\u00a0night. Newt Gingrich on the war in Afghanistan under Trump Former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich claimed that \u201cPresident Trump orchestrated an orderly end to the Afghanistan war with no American killed in nearly two years.\u201d Facts first: Both of these claims are false. Although Trump oversaw a deal with the Taliban aimed at the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, the war did not end under his presidency. The last US troops left Afghanistan in August 2021 under the Biden administration. Moreover, there is no period of \u201cnearly two years\u201d under Trump\u2019s presidency where no American service member was killed. During his four years in office, there were 45 US service member hostile deaths, according to the Defense Casualty Analysis System. The longest stretch without combat deaths was at the end of his presidency, from March 2020 until he left office in January 2021 \u2013 less than a year. From CNN\u2019s Jennifer Hansler Former Trump intel chief misleadingly says \u2018Taliban is back\u2019 Richard Grenell, who served as the acting Director of National Intelligence in 2020, said Wednesday night that under President Joe Biden \u201cthe Taliban is back.\u201d \u201c[A]fter four years of Joe Biden, wars are back, the Taliban is back and members of ISIS have slipped through America\u2019s broken southern border,\u201d Grenell said. Facts first: The claim that the \u201cTaliban is back\u201d is misleading, as\u00a0it insinuates the Taliban ever left.  While it\u2019s true that the Taliban returned to power after the United States\u2019 2021 withdrawal, the Taliban remained present in Afghanistan throughout former President Donald Trump\u2019s time in office. The US, under the Trump administration, and the Taliban signed a historic agreement in 2020 that set into motion the US\u2019 withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan. Officials within the Trump administration also met with Taliban representatives \u201crepeatedly\u201d in Doha for nearly a year, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction said in a 2019 report. From CNN\u2019s Haley Britzky Rep. Ronny Jackson\u2019s false claim of \u2018record-high inflation\u2019 Rep. Ronny Jackson of Texas claimed in his Republican National Convention speech on Wednesday that there has been \u201crecord-high inflation\u201d under the Biden administration. Facts First: This is false. The record for US inflation, set in 1920, is 23.7%; the Biden-era peak was 9.1% in June 2022. Jackson could fairly say there was a four-decade high under Biden \u2013 that June 2022 figure was the highest since late 1981 \u2013 but there was nothing close to a new record. In addition, Jackson didn\u2019t mention that inflation has fallen sharply since the Biden-era peak two years ago. The current inflation rate, for June 2024, is 3%. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale RNC chairman\u2019s false claim about Russia\u2019s nuclear missiles near Cuba RNC Chairman Michael Whatley claimed in his opening speech on Wednesday evening that Russia has \u201cparked a nuclear missile capable boat\u201d in Cuba. \u201cWhere are we today? Russia has invaded Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve parked a nuclear missile capable boat 90 miles off our shore in Havana, Cuba.\u201d Facts first: This claim about the status of a Russian boat is false. While Russia did have a nuclear-powered submarine visiting Cuba in June along with other Russian Navy vessels, all of the vessels \u2013 including the submarine \u2013 have since left.  A group of four Russian Navy vessels arrived in Cuba on June 12 as part of what Pentagon and State Department officials stressed is a routine activity and noted that Cuba has hosted Russian ships every year between 2013 and 2020. A Pentagon spokesperson, Maj. Charlie Dietz, said in June that \u201cgiven Russia\u2019s long history of\u00a0Cuban port calls, these are considered routine naval visits, especially in the context of increased US support to Ukraine and NATO exercises.\u201d The nuclear-powered submarine, the Kazan, was the first of the vessels to leave Havana on June 17. From CNN\u2019s Haley Britzky RNC video falsely claims there was peace in the Middle East under Trump A video played early in the Republican National Convention proceedings on Wednesday night claimed that the \u201cstrength\u201d of President Donald Trump kept \u201cthe Middle East at peace.\u201d Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley had similarly claimed in his convention speech on Monday that the Middle East was \u201cat peace\u201d four years ago under Trump. Facts First:\u00a0The claim that there was peace in the Middle East under Trump is false. Whatever the merits of the Abraham Accords that Trump\u2019s administration helped to negotiate, in which Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates\u00a0agreed in 2020 to normalize relations with Israel\u00a0(Morocco and Sudan followed), there was still lots of unresolved armed conflict around the Middle East when Trump left office in early 2021. The list notably included\u00a0the civil war in Yemen;\u00a0the civil war in Syria; and the conflicts between Israel and Palestinians in\u00a0Gaza\u00a0and\u00a0the West Bank, between Israel and\u00a0Hezbollah on its border with Lebanon,\u00a0between Israel and Syria, and what former State Department official\u00a0Aaron David Miller called \u201cthe war between the wars\u00a0between Israel and Iran on air, land and sea.\u201d\u00a0Also,\u00a0the US, its allies and civilians\u00a0continued to be attacked\u00a0in an unstable Iraq. \u201cIt\u2019s a highly inaccurate statement,\u201d Miller, who worked on Mideast peace negotiations while in government and is now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said last fall, when Trump himself made a similar claim about having achieved peace in the Middle East. Dana El Kurd, senior nonresident fellow at the Arab Center Washington DC think tank, also called that claim \u201cfalse\u201d when Trump made it. She said in a November email: \u201cThe Abraham Accords did not achieve peace in the Middle East. In fact, violence escalated in Israel-Palestine in the aftermath of the Accords (using any metric you can think of \u2013 death tolls, settlement violence, etc).\u201d From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale RNC video cites right-wing think tank without mentioning it was doing so A video played at the beginning of Republican National Convention proceedings on Wednesday evening attacked President Joe Biden\u2019s handling of foreign policy \u2013 and featured a narrator saying, \u201cThe Defense News reports today that the US military is in decline and threats from China are formidable.\u201d Facts First: This claim is misleading. Defense News, an independent publication covering national security, did not itself assert that the US military is in decline. Rather, the publication reported that the right-wing Heritage Foundation think tank had made that assertion. A Defense News article in October 2022 was headlined, \u201cUS military in decline, threats from China \u2018formidable,\u2019 report says.\u201d\u00a0The article explained that these assertions came from \u201ca new\u00a0report\u00a0by the\u00a0Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that each year analyzes the strength of the armed forces and the threats to America.\u201d From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/fact-check-night-3-republican-national-convention/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_politics_trump-shooter-requested-saturday-off-from-work", "text": "The shooter who attempted to assassinate former President Donald Trump on Saturday normally would have been at work that day, but he told his boss he needed that the day off because he had \u201csomething to do,\u201d according to multiple law enforcement officials. Thomas Matthew Crooks told his coworkers he would be back to work on Sunday. While investigators have not been able to identify a motive for Crooks\u2019 attack at the rally in Butler County, Pennsylvania, they are piecing together more of his activities. By 3 p.m. on Saturday, roughly three hours before the shooting, Crooks was at the security screening area for the rally. He first aroused suspicion when he passed through the magnetometers carrying a\u00a0rangefinder, which looks similar to a small pair of binoculars and is used by hunters and target shooters to measure distances when setting up a long-range shot, according to a senior law enforcement official briefed on the investigation. The rangefinder would not have prevented Crooks from getting through the security screening point, but it did attract the attention of security personnel who kept an eye on him until he left the secure area. Investigators are unsure of where Crooks went after he left the screening area but the working theory is that he went to his car to retrieve the rifle. Around the same time witnesses alerted police that Crooks was crawling on the roof of the American Glass Research building, one of the four counter-sniper teams observed Crooks looking at their position through the rangefinder, according to the senior law enforcement official. \u201cThey were looking at him while he was looking at them,\u201d the official said. Crooks gained access to the rooftop by climbing on top of the building\u2019s air conditioning system and hoisting himself up, according to a senior federal law enforcement official briefed on the investigation. Around 11 p.m., Crooks\u2019 father reported him missing, law enforcement officials told CNN. His father told agents that he believed his son had taken the rifle Saturday to go to the shooting range and thought he would be back by around 1:00 p.m., the sources said. After the shooting, multiple law enforcement sources said investigators found a bulletproof vest, three fully-loaded magazines, and two remote-controlled explosive devices in Crooks\u2019 car. Investigators are uncertain as to whether Crooks had a plan to use the body armor, nearly 100 rounds of additional ammunition from those loaded magazines, and two remote-controlled bombs, had he escaped after the shooting. Additionally, after a search of his residence, investigators discovered another bulletproof vest, another remote-controlled explosive device, and a 3D printer, according to multiple law enforcement sources. In the last several months, Crooks received multiple packages, including some marked as possibly containing hazardous materials, according to a joint FBI and Department of Homeland Security bulletin obtained by CNN.

{"id": "2024_07_16_politics_iran-plot-assassinate-trump-secret-service", "text": "US authorities obtained intelligence\u00a0from a human source\u00a0in recent weeks on a plot by Iran to try to assassinate Donald Trump, a development that led to the Secret Service increasing security around the former president,\u00a0multiple\u00a0people briefed on the matter told CNN. There\u2019s no indication that\u00a0Thomas Matthew Crooks, the would-be assassin who attempted to kill the\u00a0former\u00a0president on Saturday, was connected to the plot, the sources said. The existence of the intelligence threat from a hostile foreign intelligence agency \u2014\u00a0and the enhanced security for Trump \u2014 raises new questions about the security lapses at the Saturday rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and how a 20-year-old man managed to access a nearby rooftop to fire shots that injured the former president. A US national security official said the Secret Service and Trump campaign were made aware of the threat before Saturday\u2019s rally. \u201cSecret Service learned of the increased threat from this threat stream,\u201d the official told CNN. \u201cNSC directly contacted USSS at a senior level to be absolutely sure they continued to track the latest reporting.\u00a0USSS shared this information with the detail lead, and the Trump campaign was made aware of an evolving threat. In response to the increased threat, Secret Service surged resources and assets for the protection of former President Trump. All of this was in advance of Saturday.\u201d The Trump campaign would not disclose whether it was made aware of the Iran threat.\u00a0\u201cWe do not comment on President Trump\u2019s security detail. All questions should be directed to The United States Secret Service,\u201d the campaign said in a statement. Secret Service officials have warned the Trump campaign repeatedly against holding outdoor rallies, which pose greater risks than events to which the agency can better control access, people briefed on the matter said.\u00a0The warnings have been more general in nature, the sources said. \u201cThe Secret Service and other agencies are constantly receiving new potential threat information and taking action to adjust resources, as needed,\u201d Anthony Guglielmi, an agency spokesman, said on Tuesday. \u201cWe cannot comment on any specific threat stream, other than to say that the Secret Service takes threats seriously and responds accordingly.\u201d At one point during this\u00a0election\u00a0cycle, the campaign stopped holding spontaneous\u00a0off-the-record events where guests weren\u2019t swept by\u00a0Secret\u00a0Service beforehand due to security concerns, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. The FBI, which is conducting the investigation into Saturday\u2019s shooting, declined to comment. NSC spokesperson Adrienne Watson said there\u2019s\u00a0no\u00a0known link between shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks and\u00a0anyone\u00a0else at the moment. \u201cThe investigation of Saturday\u2019s attempted assassination of former President Trump is active and ongoing.\u00a0At this time, law enforcement has reported that their investigation has not identified ties between the shooter and any accomplice or co-conspirator, foreign or domestic,\u201d Watson said. The Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations denied there is an Iranian plot to assassinate Trump. \u201cThese accusations are unsubstantiated and malicious. From the perspective of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Trump is a criminal who must be prosecuted and punished in a court of law for ordering the assassination of General Soleimani. Iran has chosen the legal path to bring him to justice,\u201d a spokesperson for the mission told CNN, referencing Qasem Soleimani, the commander of the Iranian military\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, who was killed\u00a0by a US airstrike at Baghdad International Airport in January 2020. CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria pressed Iran\u2019s acting Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani on the alleged Iranian assassination plot, asking in an interview if the plot was in retaliation for Soleimani\u2019s killing, which took place during the Trump administration. \u201cI told you explicitly that we would resort to legal and judicial procedures and frameworks at the domestic level and international level in order to bring the perpetrators and military advisers of General Soleimani\u2019s assassination to justice,\u201d Kani told Zakaria in an interview that will air Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cFareed Zakaria GPS.\u201d Pressed further if that meant not using violent measures, Kani said, \u201cWe will only resort to Iranian and international legal and judicial procedures.\u201d \u201cUntil now, we have done it, and this is our right and of course we will continue it. And the Americans openly said that, that they assassinated the senior Iranian military commander. So it is our natural right in order to follow this issue, and those who are accused in this case, they should be brought to justice in a \u2014 in a just court,\u201d Kani said. Trump and the Republican vice presidential nominee, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, will hold their first official campaign rally together on Saturday at an indoor arena in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the campaign announced Tuesday. Surge of threats from Iranian state-backed media Iran has repeatedly vowed revenge for the US military\u2019s killing of Soleimani. And former senior Trump administration officials who worked on national security have had tight security since leaving\u00a0the\u00a0government. In August 2022, the Justice Department announced criminal charges against a member of the IRGC for allegedly trying to orchestrate the assassination of John Bolton, who served as Trump\u2019s national security\u00a0adviser.\u00a0US\u00a0prosecutors said the plot against Bolton was \u201clikely in retaliation\u201d for Soleimani\u2019s assassination. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was also a target of the Iranian assassination plot, according to a federal law enforcement source familiar with the investigation and a source close to Pompeo. Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, had a US government security detail due to threats from Iran, like Pompeo and other former Trump officials, but that detail was dropped last summer, according to sources familiar with the matter. O\u2019Brien is now paying for his own private security detail, sources said. Lawmakers were not given a specific reason for the decision, which led to frustration. O\u2019Brien did not respond to a request for comment. Bolton still has his Secret Service detail. For months, law enforcement officials have been concerned about the persistent threat of Iran potentially attempting to assassinate former Trump officials and the former president himself, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. But the recent intelligence suggested a significant uptick in the threat, the sources told CNN. Warnings about that operational planning have coincided with a noticeable surge of online messaging from Iranian accounts and state-backed media mentioning Trump, which has raised security concerns among US officials, one of the sources told CNN.

King was expected to appear for a preliminary hearing in a military court, on Tuesday at Fort Bliss, Texas, but it\u00a0was delayed according to a spokeswoman for the Army\u2019s Office of Special Trial Counsel.\u00a0The spokeswoman said the delay was requested by King\u2019s defense counsel and OSTC didn\u2019t object. Rosenblatt told CNN in a phone call on Tuesday that\u00a0while his team sent the email requesting the delay, it\u00a0was the result of a joint request from both sides as negotiations are ongoing. \u201cWe are negotiating a resolution and because of that, no need to have the [Article 32 hearing] right now,\u201d Rosenblatt said, adding that the Article 32 hearing has been delayed for two weeks\u00a0and would likely not\u00a0be necessary if a plea agreement is reached. King\u00a0is facing eight charges under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, including desertion, possession of child pornography, assaulting a noncommissioned officer, and disobeying a superior officer. His case was taken over by the Army\u2019s Office of Special Trial Counsel \u2014 a new office within each of the military services that handles the prosecution of crimes such as murder, sexual assault, kidnapping and domestic violence \u2014\u00a0on July 10, the spokesperson for the office, Michelle McCaskill, told CNN. Rosenblatt declined to provide details of the plea agreement which was first reported by Stars & Stripes. A spokesperson for OSTC declined to comment on the possibility of a plea deal but said prosecutors did not object to delaying the Article 32 hearing. Roughly a week before fleeing into North Korea in July 2023,\u00a0King\u00a0had been released from a detention facility in South Korea, where he\u2019d been held over after an October 2022 incident in which he allegedly pushed and punched a victim in the face at a club in Seoul. The day he crossed the border into North Korea,\u00a0King\u00a0was supposed to have boarded a flight back to Texas, but he instead left the airport after US Army escorts left him at the security checkpoint. King\u00a0was returned to US custody last September. Since his return, Rosenblatt said\u00a0King\u00a0spent three weeks at the Defense Department\u2019s reintegration center, run by US Army South in San Antonio, Texas. He then went to Fort Bliss; when he arrived, Rosenblatt said,\u00a0King\u00a0was ordered into pre-trial confinement where he has remained since October 18. He is now being held in a detention center in New Mexico that is run by a company contracted by the Army, Rosenblatt said.

{"id": "2024_07_17_politics_how-atf-identified-trump-rally-shooter", "text": "Within 30 minutes of the shooting at Donald Trump\u2019s Pennsylvania rally on Saturday, federal law enforcement used a byzantine paper records system to track down decade-old\u00a0gun\u00a0sales records to help identify the 20-year-old\u00a0would-be assassin. Law enforcement agents initially ran into roadblocks as they attempted to name the shooter, later identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks. Crooks was not carrying any ID when he was shot by Secret Service agents. But what he did have was an AR-style rifle used to carry out the deadly shooting. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives analysts at a facility in West Virginia search through millions of documents by hand every day to try to identify the provenance of guns used in crimes. Typically, the bureau takes around eight days to track a weapon, though for urgent traces that average falls to 24 hours. It\u2019s a process that has been used for several other high-profile and time sensitive investigations. After the Highland Park, Illinois,\u00a0mass shooter fled in July 2022, police\u00a0used the ATF tracing system\u00a0on a firearm he left at the scene to learn his identity. And police used a firearm that bystanders wrestled away from the man who shot and killed 11 people in\u00a0Monterey Park, California, to identify him. The firearms tracing system is \u201cinvaluable,\u201d Brian Gallagher, a former supervisor at the ATF Philadelphia field division, told CNN. \u201cIn situations where we have high profile shootings and where firearms are recovered, the local ATF offices can request an emergency trace\u201d for the weapons found at a crime scene, Gallagher said. Some critics say that the ATF tracing system is cumbersome or unreliable or point out that the US is also a nation awash in guns, which can be bought and sold privately without creating official records. In an era of high-tech evidence gathering, including location data and a trove of evidence from cell phones and other electronic devices used by shooting\u00a0suspects, ATF agents have to search through paper records to find a gun\u2019s history. In some cases, those records have even been kept on microfiche or were held in shipping containers, sources told CNN, especially for some of the closed business records like in this case. The\u00a0outdated\u00a0records-keeping system stems from congressional laws that prohibit the ATF from creating searchable digital records, in part because gun rights groups for years have fanned fears that the ATF could create a database of firearm owners and that it could eventually lead to confiscation. But the urgent ATF trace Saturday proved indispensable in identifying the Pennsylvania shooter, giving authorities a key clue toward his identity in less than half an hour. \u201cATF completed an urgent trace through ATF\u2019s National Tracing Center based on out of business records from a closed gun dealer,\u201d the ATF said in a statement Sunday. \u201cResults were provided to the FBI and Secret Service in less than 30 minutes that helped identify the shooter.\u201d Agents tracked the AR-15 style rifle the shooter used to a 2013 purchase from the\u00a0now-closed\u00a0dealer, sources familiar with investigators\u2019 findings told CNN. The revelation added to complications for the FBI, ATF and other agencies who were trying to identify the gunman after he was shot and killed by a US Secret Service sniper. ATF agents worked with the gun\u2019s manufacturer, and manually searched through the closed gun shop\u2019s paper records, eventually tracing the rifle to the shooter\u2019s father.\u00a0Investigators believe that the shooter\u2019s father may have been an avid firearms collector or bought and sold weapons, sources briefed on the matter said. The finding brought federal law enforcement officers to Crooks\u2019 home and allowed investigators to hone in on who was responsible for the assassination attempt.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/how-atf-identified-trump-rally-shooter/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Arrests along the US southern border dropped 29% in June, according to new data released by US Customs and Border Protection, following the Biden administration\u2019s order severely limiting asylum-seeker crossings. June arrests totaled just over 83,000, the lowest since President Joe Biden took office. \u201cRecent border security measures have made a meaningful impact on our ability to impose consequences for those crossing unlawfully,\u201d CBP Acting Commissioner Troy A. Miller said in a statement. Last month, the Biden administration invoked an authority to shut off access\u00a0to asylum for migrants who cross the US-Mexico border illegally,\u00a0a significant attempt\u00a0to address one of the president\u2019s biggest political vulnerabilities. It was the administration\u2019s most dramatic move on the US southern border and used the same authority former President Donald Trump tried to use in office. Speakers at the Republican National Convention this week have sought to exploit immigration as a key differentiator between Biden and Trump, though many have made false and misleading claims. The order temporarily freezes asylum processing when daily arrests reach 2,500. Senior administration officials said it would be lifted when there\u2019s a daily average of fewer than 1,500 encounters in between ports of entry. Unaccompanied children, victims of a severe form of trafficking, those who present an acute medical emergency or an imminent and extreme threat to life and safety \u2013 among select others \u2013 are exempt. After the order was enacted, USCBP reported that the seven-day average of daily arrests fell more than 50% by the end of last month. Data released by CBP also claimed that the Department of Homeland Security has repatriated more 70,000 individuals to over 170 countries since the order\u2019s implementation. Removals in the past year exceed removals of any fiscal year since 2010. Migrant levels surged in 2023, with federal authorities reporting a seven-day average of more than 9,600 migrant encounters along the US southern border in the last month of the year, according to a Homeland Security official, among the highest amounts ever recorded. Still, Biden\u2019s order received backlash from immigration advocates and member of the Democratic caucus. Later in June, the administration announced another order allowing certain undocumented spouses and children of US citizens to apply for lawful permanent residency without leaving the country.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/border-arrests-june-biden-order/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_politics_donald-trump-robert-f-kennedy-vaccine-skepticism", "text": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s son, Bobby Kennedy III, posted a video of a phone call between Kennedy and former President Donald Trump in which the former president appeared to endorse false theories about the safety of vaccines. Kennedy III posted a brief video on social media Tuesday morning filming Kennedy Jr. as he listens to Trump speak on the phone. Kennedy III said the video was taken on Sunday, the day after Trump was injured during a shooting at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Kennedy III deleted the post containing the video hours later. In the video, Trump can be heard discussing the amount of doses of vaccines that are scheduled for children, and suggested that after taking a high volume of vaccines, \u201cyou see the baby all of a sudden starting to change radically.\u201d \u201cWhen you feed a baby, Bobby, a vaccination that is, like, 38 different vaccines and it looks like it\u2019s been for a horse. Not a, you know, 10-pound or 20-pound baby,\u201d Trump says on the call. \u201cAnd then you see the baby all of a sudden starting to change radically. I\u2019ve seen it too many times.\u201d Trump also appeared to express some skepticism toward public health professionals who accurately state the recommended immunization schedule for children is safe and effective, saying, \u201cAnd then you hear it doesn\u2019t have an impact, right?\u201d By age 6, children may receive vaccinations that protect them from\u00a016 different diseases, including life-threatening infections such as measles, pertussis and polio. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the vaccines are recommended for very young children\u00a0before\u00a0they are likely to come into contact with serious diseases, as they are at highest risk of serious illness or death. Vaccines are often combined into a single dose in order to\u00a0reduce the number\u00a0of office visits and shots. Needles used for\u00a0infant vaccines\u00a0are typically an inch or less long, and for some vaccines, dose sizes for the very young are smaller than those used for older children or adults. Some infant vaccines are also administered orally, and certain flu vaccines for people as young as 2 can be administered as a nasal spray. Kennedy Jr. apologized to Trump for the video of the phone call being released after his son took the video down. \u201cWhen President Trump called me, I was taping with an in-house videographer. I should have ordered the videographer to stop recording immediately. I am mortified that this was posted. I apologize to the president,\u201d Kennedy wrote on social media Tuesday. When asked whether Trump knew he was being recorded, Trump\u2019s advisers pointed CNN to Kennedy\u2019s tweet, in which he said a videographer was filming him for a separate project. The Biden campaign said in a statement Tuesday, \u201cTrump and his anti-vax bud \u2018Bobby\u2019 are spreading dangerous conspiracy theories that threaten the lifesaving care that tens of millions of people depend on.\u201d \u201cThis leaked footage is further proof Trump can\u2019t be trusted to protect Americans\u2019 health care. It\u2019s frightening, and if he gains power, it could be the devastating reality for working families across the country,\u201d the statement said. CNN has reached out to the Kennedy campaign and Trump campaigns for comment. The phone call shown in the video came one day before Trump and Kennedy met in Milwaukee. Kennedy campaign spokesperson Stefanie Spear told CNN the two presidential candidates discussed \u201cnational unity\u201d during the meeting. A source familiar with the conversation said the two also discussed Trump\u2019s vice presidential nomination decision hours before he selected Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate. In January 2017, before Trump was inaugurated, Kennedy said Trump had asked him to lead a commission to study vaccine safety following a meeting between the two at Trump Tower in New York. The commission ultimately never materialized. Trump appeared to reference the meeting in the clip of the phone call. \u201cYou and I talked about that a long time ago,\u201d Trump tells Kennedy on the call. Trump has long entertained vaccine skepticism, but his stance toward vaccines has taken added political urgency after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis made his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic a major issue during the Republican primary. Trump has said he would defund any public school that enforces vaccine mandates. The policy agenda on his campaign website questions the origins of \u201can unexplained and alarming growth in the prevalence of chronic illnesses and health problems, especially in children.\u201d As a candidate, Kennedy has repeatedly made false claims about the safety and efficacy of vaccines. He\u2019s regularly criticized Trump for approving public health restrictions during the pandemic and implementing a plan to accelerate the development of a Covid vaccine. Kennedy often attempts to link Trump to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who helped lead the US Covid response during the Trump and Biden administrations and has become a focal point of criticism from some on the right. All vaccines that are approved or authorized for use in the United States have been proven safe and effective through rigorous scientific study. Childhood vaccinations are particularly important because they train the body\u2019s immune system to recognize viruses it has not yet been exposed to, and protect the body from the harmful effects of those viruses. Severe allergic reactions are exceedingly rare \u2013 occurring in roughly 1 in 1 million people. Far more common are mild side effects, such as pain or swelling at the injection site, which tend to subside quickly. Worldwide, vaccines prevent more than 4 million deaths every year, according to the World Health Organization. And while there is still no scientific consensus on what causes autism, vaccines, conclusively, do not. Trump also discussed with Kennedy the shooting on Saturday, which left him wounded in his right ear, and the phone call he received from President Joe Biden following the assassination attempt. \u201cHe was very nice actually. He called and he said, \u2018How did you choose to move to the right?,\u201d Trump says in the video of his call with Biden. \u201cI said, \u2018I was just showing a chart.\u2019 I didn\u2019t have to tell him the chart was going all the people pouring into our country, right?\u201d \u201cI just turned my head to show the chart and something raps me,\u201d he continues. \u201cAnd it sounds like a giant, like the world\u2019s largest mosquito. And, uh, it was. It was a bullet.\u201d CNN\u2019s Steve Contorno and Alayna Treene contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/politics/donald-trump-robert-f-kennedy-vaccine-skepticism/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_politics_corey-comperatore-trump-shooting-victim", "text": "Friends and neighbors are remembering firefighter Corey Comperatore \u2013 the 50-year-old man shot and killed during the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump \u2013 as a family man who served his community and was quick to help friends in need. Comperatore was one of the thousands of people who attended the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, part of Trump\u2019s 2024 reelection effort. He died trying to protect his family, according to Gov. Josh Shapiro. Pennsylvania State Police confirmed his identity on Sunday. Two other spectators were seriously wounded in Saturday\u2019s attack, and the gunman\u00a0was killed by Secret Service agents at the scene after the shooting. The FBI is investigating the attack as an assassination attempt, the agency said. Shapiro, who directed flags to be flown at half-staff in Comperatore\u2019s memory, said he spoke to Comperatore\u2019s wife and two daughters Sunday. An avid Trump supporter who was excited to be at the rally, Comperatore dove on his family to protect them from the gunfire, Shapiro said. \u201cCorey was a girl dad. Corey was a firefighter. Corey went to church every Sunday. Corey loved his community. Most especially, Corey loved his family,\u201d said Shapiro. In an interview with the New York Post on Monday, Helen Comperatore, the widow of Corey Comperatore, shared her husband\u2019s last words, spoken as he shielded his family from bullets that ultimately took his life. \u201cHe\u2019s my hero,\u201d Helen Comperatore said. \u201cHe just said, \u2018Get down!\u2019 That was the last thing he said.\u201d Comperatore also is survived by daughters Allyson and Kaylee, his mother, two sisters and a stepbrother, according to an obituary posted by Redmond Funeral Home in Freeport, Pennsylvania. Mike Morehouse, who lived next to Comperatore for years, told The Associated Press he counts Comperatore as a hero and intends to vote in the upcoming election in his memory. \u201cAs soon as I heard what happened and then learned that it was to Corey, I went upstairs as soon as I got home and I registered to vote,\u201d Morehouse told the AP. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve ever voted and I think it will be in his memory.\u201d Other victims are stable at a hospital The two rallygoers who were wounded \u2013 David Dutch, 57, of New Kensington, Pennsylvania, and James Copenhaver, 74, of Moon Township, Pennsylvania \u2013 are stable, state police said Sunday in a news release. Copenhaver\u2019s family released a statement Tuesday through Allegheny General Hospital, saying he was in critical condition but stable. They denounced the shooting as a \u201chorrible, senseless, and unnecessary act of violence.\u201d Copenhaver was praying for \u201ca safe and speedy recovery\u201d for the other victims, their families and the former president, the family statement reads. The Marine Corps League of Pennsylvania, Inc. identified Dutch as a commandant in their organization\u2019s location in Westmoreland County. Vice Commandant Matt Popovich said on Facebook Dutch underwent two surgeries after being \u201cshot in the liver and chest.\u201d \u201cThese victims and their families are certainly in our thoughts today,\u201d said state police commissioner Col. Christopher Paris. \u201cThe Pennsylvania State Police continue to work tirelessly alongside our federal, state and local partners as this investigation continues.\u201d The former president was shot in his right ear, he said on social media, leaving his face streaked with blood. A GoFundMe campaign for the victims\u2019 families, verified by the fundraising platform, had raised more than $5 million as of Tuesday evening, more than triple its initial goal. More than 63,000 donations have poured in, according to the website. A separate GoFundMe campaign for Comperatore\u2019s family, also verified by the platform, collected more than $1.1 million by Tuesday evening. That campaign, organized by a man who described himself as a neighbor and friend, had an initial goal of $7,000. \u2018It was going to be a nice day with family,\u2019 widow tells paper Helen Comperatore told the New York Post she and Corey were childhood sweethearts and about to celebrate their 29th\u00a0wedding anniversary when the family headed to the rally to support Trump. \u201cMe and the kids were all there as a family,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was just excited. It was going to be a nice day with the family.\u201d Describing her late husband to the newspaper as a \u201csimple man,\u201d Helen Comperatore said he put \u201chis wife and kids first all the time.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t lift a finger,\u201d she said. \u201cHe did everything.\u201d His obituary said his life was guided by his faith, and he inspired others to live with purpose and grace. \u201cCorey\u2019s legacy is not just in the major milestones he achieved but in the small acts of kindness that marked his everyday life,\u201d the obituary says. \u201cHe was quick to help those in need, never expecting anything in return, and his impact on the lives he touched was profound.\u201d Trump has spoken with Helen Comperatore, she said on her private Facebook page Tuesday, according to the\u00a0New York Post. CNN has reached out to the Comperatore family to verify the post. \u201cPresident Trump called me to share his condolences,\u201d the post reportedly said. \u201cHe was very kind and said he would continue to call me in the days and weeks ahead.\u201d \u201cI told him the same thing I told everyone else. He left this world a hero and God welcome him in. He did not die in vain that day,\u201d she added, according to the New York Post. When Trump was asked by the New York Post this weekend whether he was considering attending Comperatore\u2019s funeral, he said yes. The funeral home obituary said details of that event are private. Trump\u2019s call comes after the widow told the New York Post on Monday that President Joe Biden did try to call her after the shooting, but she doesn\u2019t want to speak to him. \u201cMy husband was a devout Republican, and he would not have wanted me to talk to him.\u201d However, Helen Comperatore added she does not hold the current president responsible for what happened to her family. \u201cI don\u2019t have any ill-will towards Joe Biden,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not one of those people that gets involved in politics. I support Trump, that\u2019s who I\u2019m voting for, but I don\u2019t have ill-will towards Biden.\u201d \u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything to my husband. A 20-year-old despicable kid did,\u201d she continued. Speaking Sunday afternoon, Biden expressed his condolences to Comperatore\u2019s family. \u201cWe also extend our deepest condolences to the family of the victim who was killed,\u201d the president said. \u201cHe was a father; he was protecting his family from the bullets being fired when he lost his life. God love him. We are also praying for the full recovery of those who were injured.\u201d A community in mourning The Buffalo Township Volunteer Fire Company hung Comperatore\u2019s uniform outside the fire station Sunday in a memorial to his life. \u201cOur company is dealing with a tragic loss that not only is affecting our members, but this community and Corey\u2019s family and friends,\u201d the fire company said on Facebook, also calling Comperatore \u201ca brother, son, husband, father and friend.\u201d Matthew Achilles, who lived near Comperatore, told CNN affiliate WTAE, \u201cHe was a real good guy. He really was. You hear stories all the time that it\u2019s always the good ones that end up getting taken out, and unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened.\u201d \u201cHe helped us out when I was real sick a couple years ago. I was in the hospital and almost died. Corey was one of the first people to message me and say \u2018Hey, how can I help you,\u2019\u201d Achilles said. Bishop David Zubik of the Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh said in a statement, \u201cComperatore\u2019s selfless act in the face of danger speaks to his strength of character, deep faith, and dedication to serving others.\u201d \u201cLet us also take this moment to pray for unity and an end to violence and inflammatory rhetoric in our community and across our nation,\u201d he said. In the outpouring of sympathy, many have highlighted Comperatore\u2019s dedication to the community he served. \u201cCorey Comperatore died a hero, the way he lived, shielding his family from gunfire. He was a former\u00a0fire\u00a0chief, a proud father and loving husband.\u00a0We will pray for his family.\u00a0May he rest in peace,\u201d Robert\u00a0Brooks, president of the Pennsylvania Professional Fire Fighters Association, told CNN in a statement Sunday. The Buffalo Township Board of Supervisors condemned political violence in a statement to CNN Sunday. \u201cCorey was a dedicated husband, father, friend, and volunteer to the community, and will be sorely missed,\u201d the statement said.

{"id": "2024_07_16_politics_nikki-haley-trump-rnc-speech", "text": "Former South Carolina Gov.\u00a0Nikki Haley\u00a0endorsed Donald Trump\u2019s campaign Tuesday night in her Republican National Convention speech, her latest step toward embracing her former rival and unifying the party after their bitter presidential primary. \u201cI\u2019ll start by making one thing perfectly clear: Donald Trump has my strong endorsement, period,\u201d\u00a0Haley said Tuesday. As Trump watched on from the convention center\u2019s VIP suite, Haley used her speech to defend the former president\u2019s foreign policy record and speak directly to voters who disagree with him on certain issues. \u201cThere are some Americans who don\u2019t agree with Donald Trump 100% of the time,\u201d she said. \u201cMy message to them is simple: You don\u2019t have to agree with Trump 100% of the time to vote for him.\u201d Haley\u2019s speech Tuesday capped off a gradual easing of tensions between the former governor and Trump after a bruising, yearlong campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, in which Haley urged GOP voters to back her to avoid the \u201cchaos\u201d that she said follows the former president. Haley, who released her delegates last week and implored them to support Trump, was a late addition to the program. She was invited to appear onstage in Milwaukee\u00a0only over the weekend, which coincided with the\u00a0assassination attempt on Trump\u00a0and\u00a0the former president\u2019s call for themes of unity at the convention. Unity between Trump and his former primary rivals was a key theme Tuesday. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis used his speech, which followed Haley\u2019s, to call on Republicans to help elect the former president. \u201cDonald Trump, he\u2019s been demonized. He\u2019s been sued. He\u2019s been prosecuted. And he nearly lost his life,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cWe cannot let him down, and we cannot let America down.\u201d A bitter campaign After primary losses in New Hampshire and her home state of South Carolina, Haley defied calls to drop out and rally around Trump. Instead, she leaned harder into criticisms of the former president and his age. At campaign events, she frequently pointed out that polls suggested she would be more competitive than Trump against President Joe Biden in a general election matchup and warned that his legal troubles would dominate much of the campaign cycle. When Haley did end her campaign in early March, the day after Super Tuesday, she did not endorse the former president as primary rivals such as DeSantis had done. \u201cIt is now up to Donald Trump to earn the vote \u2013 those in our party and beyond it, who did not support him. And I hope he does that,\u201d she said in her exit announcement. But in May, Haley, who served as Trump\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, said she would vote for the former president, arguing that Biden would be worse for America. And last week, shortly after she released her delegates to vote for Trump, her former rival said he would \u201ctake a look\u201d at inviting her to speak at the convention. \u201cThere was a lot of bad blood there,\u201d Trump told Fox News radio last week. \u201cShe stayed too long. She was being soundly defeated at every place, but she just wouldn\u2019t leave.\u201d Michael Whatley, the chair of the Republican National Committee, told reporters at a Bloomberg event Tuesday afternoon that he thought it was \u201ctremendously important\u201d that Haley would be speaking at the convention. \u201cWe want to talk about unifying the country, and I think that that\u2019s really where the president wants to go, particularly coming out of Saturday,\u201d Whatley said. \u201cSo having Ambassador Haley here is very important for us.\u201d Whatley declined to say when exactly the invitation to speak at the convention had been extended to Haley. Haley won less than 100 delegates, compared with the more than 2,200 who are bound to Trump, and she won just two primaries, in Vermont and Washington, DC. But in the weeks after\u00a0dropping out, she continued to receive tens of thousands of votes in primaries, including in key battleground states such as Arizona and Pennsylvania. The Biden campaign\u00a0has sought to reach Haley\u2019s supporters\u00a0through television and digital ads in hopes of reminding them of Trump\u2019s insults aimed at their candidate. Facing the convention crowd The question now is whether the unity Republicans are projecting at their convention has extended to Haley voters. Some supporters think it will. \u201cThe Nikki Haley voters will come around to Trump,\u201d Katon Dawson, a longtime Haley ally and former South Carolina Republican Party chairman, said before the speech. \u201cIt might take a while, but they\u2019ll come.\u201d Dawson pointed to his own decision to back Trump and argued that, despite Haley\u2019s past criticism of the former president, the country couldn\u2019t handle another four years of Biden. \u201cShe\u2019s doing the right thing,\u201d Dawson said of Haley speaking at the convention. South Carolina Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette, a convention delegate who backed Trump during the primary, told CNN after Haley spoke that the speech was \u201cexactly what President Trump has been calling for \u2013 a message of unity, bringing the party together and growing the party.\u201d But Tuesday\u2019s crowd also included thousands of Republican Party activists, some of whom told CNN before Haley\u2019s address that they were still wary of her after the primary. \u201cI have no problem with her speaking tonight, only if she puts her complete support behind President Trump,\u201d said Susan Cheatham, an Arizona delegate who said she thought Haley stayed in the race as long as she did to \u201cdiscredit and disrupt\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign. Aaron Farris, an uncommitted delegate from Minnesota \u2013 where Haley won nearly 30% of the primary vote \u2013 said he voted for Trump but respects the former ambassador\u2019s work at the United Nations. \u201cStuff gets said during primaries,\u201d Farris said. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s important that we\u2019re all unified going into November.\u201d Julia Black, another South Carolina delegate, said she supported Haley when she led the state but always planned to vote for Trump in the primary. The criticisms the former governor previously leveled at Trump were just a normal part of politics, she said. \u201cWho won?\u201d Black said. \u201cPoliticians. They say what they\u2019ve got to say.\u201d This story and headline have been updated with additional information.

On another night awash in emotion after Trump escaped an assassination attempt just days before, speakers joined a choreographed attempt to soften his hardman image, portraying him as a caring and even benevolent, leader, boss and grandfather while smoothing the rougher edges of his populist and authoritarian worldview. The message on night two in Milwaukee was double-edged and impossible to miss: this is indisputably and irrevocably Trump\u2019s party now and the GOP is united in pursuit of victory. \u201cDonald Trump has my full endorsement, period,\u201d said former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who warned during primary season that Trump would foment global and political chaos and who declared in February, \u201cI feel no need to kiss the ring.\u201d Her genuflection, which came shortly after Trump made another triumphant entrance into the arena, might have come through gritted teeth, but it closed off the unfinished business of an acrimonious primary race that saw the former UN ambassador win hundreds of thousands of votes long after her campaign ended. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis once billed himself as Trumpism without the pandemonium and as a potential president who could actually enact the MAGA agenda. But on Tuesday night, he implored the crowd, \u201cLet\u2019s make the 45th President of the United States the 47th President of the United States.\u201d DeSantis, whom Trump first saw as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and then a traitor, drew a rare guffaw from the ex-president at someone else\u2019s joke when he declared, \u201cAmerica cannot afford four more years of a \u2018Weekend at Bernie\u2019s\u2019 presidency,\u201d\u00a0referring to the 1989 dark comedy in which two employees pretend their dead boss is still alive. Many grassroots Republicans who backed Trump confided on this year\u2019s campaign trail that they saw the Florida governor as a potential successor \u2014 once the ex-president had moved on. But Trump watched Tuesday alongside his newly anointed MAGA heir apparent, vice presidential nominee JD Vance. The first, affectionate flush of their political infatuation was obvious and it laid bare the price DeSantis may pay for ignoring the maxim of Omar from \u201cThe Wire\u201d: \u201cYou come at the king, you best not miss.\u201d Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has spent years paying penance for his bitter 2016 primary fight with Trump, which has seen him swallow his fury at the ex-president\u2019s insults over his father and wife. He\u2019s long since dropped any hope that he can be a powerful political operator outside Trump\u2019s shadow. And he made sure many seconds did not elapse on Tuesday before roaring, \u201cGod Bless Donald J. Trump.\u201d The poetry of Trump\u2019s red-hatted followers In 2016, Trump obliterated Marco Rubio\u2019s hopes of a generational transformation of the Republican Party. The Florida senator was once a GOP hawk and orthodox conservative who backed comprehensive immigration reform in the mold of the GOP\u2019s spiritual leader before Trump, former President Ronald Reagan. But to remain politically viable, Rubio has undergone the reeducation in populist nationalism that anyone who wants a future in the GOP must endure. On Tuesday, he used his personal political heritage as a platform to lionize Trump for turning the GOP into a party for the working class, in a soaring speech that showcased the eloquence that once led pundits to put him on a fast track to the Oval Office.\u00a0Those ambitions clearly have not been fully sated \u2014 one possible reason why Trump passed him over for a spot as his vice presidential nominee. Rubio sought to imbue Trumpism and the millions of supporters who crowd into the ex-president\u2019s rallies with a kind of poetic nobility. \u201cFor those still wondering in the press and many watching at home, these, these are the Americans who wear the red hats and wait for hours under a blazing sun to hear Trump speak,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they want, what they ask for, it is not hateful or extreme.\u201d Rubio said these citizens just want the basics \u2013 good jobs, lower prices, secure borders and safety from criminals and terrorists. \u201cThere is absolutely nothing dangerous or anything divisive about putting Americans first.\u201d A mix of hero worship and personal ambition Tuesday\u2019s myth making came as no surprise. Trump has long cultivated a personality cult in the Republican Party. He demands total loyalty from subordinates and basks in public praise \u2014 as demonstrated in on-camera Cabinet meetings when officials lined up to laud him. His curated image of strength and bombast honed on the \u201cApprentice\u201d developed along lines that delighted his fans. But it horrifies many Americans since his grasps for unaccountable power often cross into demagoguery. His vows to use a second term to enact \u201cretribution\u201d could augur contentious days ahead, despite his pledge to forge national unity after narrowly avoiding death in a Pennsylvania park on Saturday afternoon. The idea of Trump as a superhuman leader has taken on a theocratic dimension since the attempt to kill him. Almost every speaker at the convention has argued that divine intervention spared the ex-president so he could be installed once again in the Oval Office on a mission of national salvation. As Trump\u2019s former White House press secretary and current governor of Arkansas, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, put it: \u201cNot even an assassin\u2019s bullet could stop him. God Almighty intervened because America is one nation under God and he\u2019s certainly not finished with President Trump.\u201d The idea that a greater force is at work is deeply felt by many delegates in Milwaukee amid an overwhelming sense that Trump has been divinely blessed. But as Trump sat alongside Vance overlooking the arena, it was also hard not to draw comparisons with the imagery of the Soviet Union, as a rotating MAGA politburo of officials and family members moved in and out of his balcony box and subordinates around him followed his every move \u2014 popping up out of their seats to join him in standing ovations and looking for cues as he pumped his fist. In bowing before Trump, his supplicants look to a distant future But Tuesday night was not exclusively about elevating Trump. His former foes had their self-interest at heart. Even Trump cannot go on forever. And on a distant day where the once and possibly future president has moved aside, there will be a GOP vacancy. Vance might have leapfrogged Trump\u2019s past rivals by snaring the vice-presidential nomination after an intense effort to impress his new ticket mate. But in any future contested fight for the Republican nomination, the approval of the Trump base will be paramount. By 2028, or whenever the next contested Republican race takes place, Rubio will be an elder statesman \u2014 far older than Vance, who\u2019s 39 and will be a heartbeat away from the presidency if the GOP ticket wins in November. Cruz may still have designs on the social and evangelical conservative sector of the GOP \u2014 which is critical to launching GOP presidential campaigns in Iowa. Huckabee Sanders could rival him for those voters. She\u2019s always been with Trump and figures to be a prominent female MAGA standard bearer in future presidential campaigns. Haley, who does well with the hawkish, internationalist wing of the party, will need to bolster her support with MAGA voters if she\u2019s to do better in a primary race in the coming years. After offering her endorsement of Trump, she effectively loaned Trump her voters \u2013 many of whom were repelled by the ex-president. \u201cThere are some Americans who don\u2019t agree with Donald Trump 100% of the time,\u201d she said. \u201cMy message to them is simple: You don\u2019t have to agree with Trump 100% of the time to vote for him.\u201d Haley smartly stressed areas where she and traditional conservatives might agree with Trump \u2013 for instance, on a hardline policy that is pro-Israel and anti-Iran. But the most remarkable foreign policy content of her speech came when she sought to reframe the ex-president\u2019s frequent cozying up to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Haley, who served as ambassador to the United Nations under Trump, is a devotee of the staunch US foreign policy creed of Reagan, whom Republicans once memorialized for winning the Cold War. But 40 years on, a Democrat, President Joe Biden, has assumed Reagan\u2019s\u00a0role of facing down Moscow\u2019s tyrant. So key GOP figures are whitewashing Trump\u2019s hero worship of Putin by suggesting that in office he wielded some kind of mystical inner strength that deterred the former KGB lieutenant colonel. \u201cPutin didn\u2019t attack Ukraine, because he knew Donald Trump was tough. A strong president doesn\u2019t start wars; a strong president prevents wars,\u201d Haley said. Her willingness to paper over her glaring foreign policy differences with Trump was another sign that the former South Carolina governor shares the reality of all the GOP presidential candidates Trump left in his wake. The only possible path to power in the future lies in homage to Trump now.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/trump-haley-desantis-rnc-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Navarro is expected to quickly travel to Milwaukee so he can appear at the Republican National Convention, where his former boss has been formally nominated as the GOP\u2019s 2024 presidential nominee. He is one of two members of Trump\u2019s circle who were convicted for failing to comply with subpoenas from the now-defunct House Select Committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, insurrection. Trump adviser Steve Bannon started\u00a0serving his four-month sentence\u00a0earlier this month at a federal prison in Connecticut. Navarro, who is in his 70s, worked as a law library clerk during his time in the prison camp, his prison consultant Sam Mangel told CNN. \u201cEverybody has to work,\u201d Mangel said. \u201cIt gave him a chance to write.\u201d Mangel said Navarro was liked and respected by his fellow inmates while in the prison. \u201cWhen I went to visit him, guys were coming up to him, high-fiving him,\u201d Mangel said. When lawmakers demanded Navarro\u2019s participation in their probe into Trump\u2019s election subversion schemes, they pointed to reports that he was involved in efforts to delay Congress\u2019 certification of the 2020 presidential results, as well as to his own account in his memoir describing the election-related plots. After just a few hours of deliberations, a federal jury found Navarro guilty last summer on two counts of contempt: for his failure to produce documents and for not showing up for an interview that the committee had demanded. Before the trial, Navarro had sought to argue to the jury that he was acting at the direction of Trump, who had invoked executive privilege, when he refused to comply with the subpoena. The judge, however, barred him from putting forward that defense, having concluded that the former White House aide had not present sufficient evidence that Trump had formally asserted the privilege. While Navarro was unsuccessful in an emergency appeal to delay his prison sentence, he is now appealing his conviction on the merits. The federal correctional facility where Navarro has lived since March is one of the oldest prison camps in the country, housing fewer than 200 inmates in its aging infrastructure, with a large Puerto Rican population.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/peter-navarro-released-from-prison-contempt/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_politics_guo-wengui-found-guilty", "text": "Guo Wengui, the exiled Chinese billionaire, was convicted in a US federal court on Tuesday for defrauding thousands of his followers of more than $1 billion. Guilty of nine out of 12 counts involving racketeering conspiracy and securities fraud, wire fraud and money laundering, Guo, who is also known as Miles Guo, \u201cfaces decades in prison\u201d when the judge hands down a sentence on November 19, according to the prosecutor. \u201cMiles Guo \u2026 brazenly operated several interrelated fraud schemes, all designed to fleece his loyal followers out of their hard-earned money\u201d to fund his luxury lifestyle when he was in exile, US Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement after the verdict. \u201cToday, Guo\u2019s schemes have been put to an end.\u201d After the verdict,\u00a0Guo\u00a0smiled at his lawyers and dozens of staunch supporters, who stuffed the\u00a0courtroom\u00a0throughout the seven-week trial in New York. He then hugged\u00a0lawyer Sabrina Shroff and shook hands with other members of the defense team. Guo\u2019s defense lawyers declined to comment on the verdict. When his\u00a0supporters\u00a0rushed out of the courtroom, a handful of them could be seen sobbing. Hao Haidong, a former soccer player\u00a0for China\u2019s\u00a0national team and one of\u00a0Guo\u2019s closest allies, declined to comment. Guo, who was exiled from China in 2014, gained a huge number of loyal followers during a series of livestreaming events when he portrayed himself as a former insider to reveal scandals, sometimes fabricated, of senior Chinese officials and elite businessmen. Guo is a close ally to former President Donald Trump\u2019s adviser Steve Bannon, who reported to federal prison earlier this month to serve a four-month sentence for defying a congressional subpoena. During closing arguments, prosecutor Ryan Finkel told the jury that Bannon was paid $1 million by Guo because Guo wanted to \u201cuse Bannon\u2019s notoriety and his fame to promote himself.\u201d Finkel said in the closing arguments last week that Guo raised more than $1 billion by guaranteeing his online followers that they would not lose money if they invested in his business and cryptocurrency schemes from 2018 to 2023. Prosecutors said Guo used money raised from victims as his \u201cpersonal piggy bank\u201d to maintain his luxurious lifestyle in the United States, after governments of China and Hong Kong seized his assets for money laundering investigations in 2017. \u201cGuo\u2019s schemes were sprawling,\u201d Finkel said. \u201cThey were vast. But they collapsed to a simple, inescapable, and obvious truth: Miles Guo lied to take other people\u2019s money.\u201d Guo\u2019s lawyer, Sidhardha Kamaraju, described\u00a0Guo\u00a0as a political dissident who had to conceal his locations and use cryptocurrency to move money freely from an oppressive regime. Kamaraju\u2019s final witness\u00a0detailed\u00a0that Jho Low,\u00a0a Malaysian fugitive\u00a0wanted by the US government, spent around $100 million trying to lobby the Trump administration to get\u00a0Guo\u00a0extradited to China. \u201cThe goal of making investors rich was also a way to spit in the eyes of the CCP,\u201d Kamaraju said,\u00a0referring to the Chinese Communist Party. \u201cMr. Guo is simply trying to show people that they could live the same life afforded to China\u2019s elites \u2026 elites like him.\u201d Prosecutors argued that Guo\u2019s political activism did not play a role in the fraud. \u201cIs Miles Guo a real political activist or not? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t care \u2026 because that\u2019s not what this trial is about,\u201d said prosecutor Juliana Murray in her rebuttal to the defense\u2019s closing argument. \u201cGuo preyed on a community of individuals who shared in the anti-CCP view,\u201d Murray said. Murray also replayed for the jury a secretly recorded phone call between Guo and his subordinates in 2021. \u201cJust shut up. Shame on you. Shameless bastard, go to hell,\u201d Guo was heard lashing out in Mandarin to his subordinates over the frustration that he couldn\u2019t move $100 million between companies. \u201cYou bastard, get the f**k out of here!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the boss of a criminal enterprise,\u201d Murray said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/politics/guo-wengui-found-guilty/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_politics_fbi-dhs-warning-trump-shooting", "text": "The FBI and Department of Homeland Security are concerned about the potential for violent \u201cfollow-on or retaliatory attacks\u201d in response to the\u00a0attempted\u00a0assassination of former President Donald Trump, the agencies said in a joint intelligence bulletin obtained by CNN. \u201cIndividuals in some online communities\u201d have threatened or encouraged violence in response to attempted assassination, the FBI and DHS said in the bulletin, which was dated July 15 and distributed to federal, state and local officials. The\u00a0attempted\u00a0assassination of Trump \u201creinforces our assessment that election-related targets are under a heightened threat\u201d of attack or disruption, the documents states. National security and law enforcement officials have been on edge since Saturday, when a gunman identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks fired at Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania,\u00a0striking the former president in the ear and killing one spectator and critically injuring two others. The new intelligence bulletin does not identify a specific or credible threat of an attack. However, the document says: \u201cWe cannot rule out the possibility\u201d that some domestic violent extremists or other people may attempt follow-on or retaliatory acts of violence in response to the attempted assassination of Trump. Intelligence assessments like the bulletin are routine in the aftermath of major security incidents. Politico first\u00a0reported\u00a0on the bulletin. There is also a general concern among law enforcement officials that extremists will step up attempts to disrupt or attack election-related infrastructure during the 2024 election cycle. Domestic violent extremists \u201cacross ideologies are likely to view\u201d a wide range of entities associated with elections as \u201cviable targets for violence,\u201d the bulletin says. \u201cLone actors\u201d or domestic violent extremists \u201coperating in small cells\u201d likely will continue to view publicly accessible locations like political rallies and campaign events as \u201cattractive targets,\u201d the bulletin adds. Some of the tactics aimed at election officials that law enforcement is concerned about include hoax bomb threats, the leaking of officials\u2019 personal information online, and \u201cswatting,\u201d in which a caller makes a bogus crime report intended to trigger a massive law enforcement response to a target\u2019s residence. \u201cWe remain concerned that the use of these tactics will increase,\u201d the bulletin says. The new threat assessment comes as the Republican National Convention continues this week in Milwaukee. The convention could be an \u201cattractive\u201d target for violent extremists looking to sow chaos by disrupting a high-profile political event, federal agencies\u00a0said\u00a0in a previous assessment. In a statement, the FBI said: \u201cWhile our standard practice is not to comment on specific intelligence products, which includes addressing their veracity, the FBI regularly shares information with our law enforcement partners to assist in protecting the communities they serve.\u201d A DHS spokesperson told CNN: \u201cWe continue to work with our partners to evaluate the threat environment, provide updates to the American public, and protect our homeland.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/politics/fbi-dhs-warning-trump-shooting/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_politics_us-military-ends-pier-mission-gaza", "text": "The US military is\u00a0ending\u00a0its\u00a0temporary pier mission\u00a0off the Gaza coast that has been plagued with challenges after roughly 20 days of operational use, as humanitarian aid begins being brought in through an Israeli port instead. \u201cOur assessment is that the temporary pier has achieved its intended effect to surge a very high volume of aid into Gaza and ensure that aid reaches the civilians in Gaza in a quick manner,\u201d deputy commander of US Central Command Vice Adm. Brad Cooper told reporters on Wednesday. The US service members operating the pier, called the Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore, or JLOTS, will soon redeploy back to the US, though Cooper did not specify when. Cooper said the pier was operational for \u201ca little more than 20 days\u201d and delivered 19.4 million pounds of aid. Going forward, aid will be brought from Cyprus directly through the Ashdod port in Israel \u2014 which Cooper called a \u201cmore sustainable path\u201d \u2014\u00a0or through land crossings into Gaza. In the last several weeks, he said, more than a million pounds of aid\u00a0was delivered through the Ashdod port. \u201cIsrael has been fully supportive of this effort,\u201d he said. For the aid now coming through the Ashdod port, Cooper said it will be taken on trucks through the Erez crossing into Gaza.\u00a0\u00a0The US military will continue to help deliver the remaining aid from Cyprus to Ashdod, Cooper said. While Cooper repeatedly\u00a0claimed that the pier had completed its mission and was successful, the effort has been plagued with issues since\u00a0the pier\u00a0was\u00a0first anchored\u00a0to the beach in Gaza in May. The pier was announced by President Joe Biden in his State of the Union address in March. \u201cA temporary pier would enable a massive increase in the amount of humanitarian assistance getting into Gaza every day,\u201d Biden said. But the pier which cost $230 million did little to alleviate the grave humanitarian situation in Gaza as the war between Hamas and\u00a0Israel,\u00a0which has claimed thousands of civilian\u00a0lives, continues. It was operational for only a week before heavy seas and a North African storm broke the pier apart, forcing it to be towed to Israel for repairs. During the same storm, four US Army vessels supporting the pier were washed ashore on beaches in Gaza and Israel. It was reattached over a week later, only to have to be temporary dismantled\u00a0again\u00a0less than a week after that in advance of more heavy seas. It was disconnected from the beach for\u00a0a third time\u00a0at the end of June, and the sea states had prevented its reattachment. During its mission, three US service members were also injured. While two experienced minor injuries and were returned to duty the same day, the third service member was in critical condition and was transferred back to the US last month to be treated at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas. Cooper said Wednesday that the soldier is no longer in critical condition but remains at the hospital. In addition to the logistical challenges with the weather, aid delivered across the pier began piling up on the beach as the World Food Programme suspended distribution due to security concerns on the ground. In mid-June, the UN\u2019s World Food Programme (WFP) paused its operations from the pier due to security concerns.\u00a0In early July, the WFP made arrangements with commercial contractors to move all of the humanitarian aid that had been offloaded from the US military\u2019s temporary pier to warehouses, a WFP spokesperson and a US official told CNN. That aid was moved by the commercial contractors to warehouses in order \u201cto avoid waste or spoilage,\u201d said WFP senior spokesperson Steve Taravella, who called it a \u201cone-off\u2019 process.\u201d WFP\u2019s distribution of aid\u00a0from the pier did not resume after it was paused. Sonali Korde, assistant to the administrator of USAID\u2019s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, told reporters alongside Cooper on Wednesday that distribution remains a \u201ckey challenge.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jennifer Hansler contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/us-military-ends-pier-mission-gaza/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_politics_2024-campaign-transformed-analysis", "text": "Donald Trump will reemerge after an attempted assassination as an even greater mythical hero of his MAGA movement with the Republican National Convention opening Monday after an extraordinary two weeks that have transformed the 2024 campaign. More than 24 hours on, the horror of Saturday\u2019s shooting is only beginning to distill into a shocking new national trauma. But both the former president and President Joe Biden are gaming out how to navigate the political aftershocks. And there was another stunning development on Monday morning, when a district judge in Florida threw out special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s case regarding Trump\u2019s handling of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort. The shock move swept away one of the four criminal cases hanging over the ex-president in a huge victory for his campaign as the convention opens. It cements the notion that, apart from his hush money conviction in New York, he will not face legal accountability before November\u2019s election. The latest twist in Trump\u2019s legal dramas came as the country was still processing the aftermath of Saturday\u2019s horrific events. An assassination attempt against a presidential candidate, with all the historical allusions it evokes, raises fears that bloodshed will beget more bloodshed as the toxic politics of the last decade threaten to take an even more ominous turn. \u201cA former president was shot, an American citizen killed while simply exercising his freedom to support the candidate of his choosing. We cannot \u2014 must not \u2014 go down this road in America,\u201d Biden said, calling for calm and for a polarized nation to unite in an address from the Oval Office on Sunday night. The president mourned Corey Comperatore, a firefighter and father, who died at the Trump rally shielding his family and joined the haunting roll of Americans lost to political violence. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, joined calls for restraint, telling CNN: \u201cIt\u2019s a dark time in the history of the country. This is a dangerous time. And we\u2019ve been suggesting that all elected officials, from the president on down, really try to draw the country together. We need a unified message. We need to turn the temperature down.\u201d In his first interview since the attempt on his life, the former president pledged that his RNC keynote address Thursday \u2014 which had been expected to be an update on his \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d inaugural address in 2017 \u2014 would be a \u201clot different.\u201d \u201cThis is a chance to bring the whole country, even the whole world, together,\u201d Trump told Salena Zito of the Washington Examiner. An earth-shaking two weeks since the CNN presidential debate has rescripted a race that had, for all its quirks, been a relatively stable grind between two unpopular candidates, neither of whom the public really wanted. Trump will show up to a convention in front of many followers who already saw him in almost a divine, superhuman light, having escaped a would-be assassin\u2019s bullet, to claim his third straight GOP nomination. The weekend\u2019s terrible events will only reinforce his control over his party. And pollsters\u00a0will be\u00a0watching to see whether sympathy over what happened swells his already broadening lead in swing states. Biden, meanwhile, spent the last two weeks fighting to save his own nomination, after his debate debacle in Atlanta exposed the 81-year-old\u2019s struggles with age and unleashed panic among Democrats that he\u2019ll hand Trump the White House and the GOP a monopoly on Washington power. The uproar over the Trump assassination attempt may pause\u00a0the intraparty\u00a0rebellion against Biden for now, especially as he assumes his role as the leader of a nation\u00a0in sudden crisis. Only the oldest Americans lived through the political assassinations of the 1960s, and those who remember the attempt to kill President Ronald Reagan in 1981 are now middle-aged. So, millions of people, who have already endured political paroxysms of recent years, are now experiencing the consequent and frightening sense of a nation off its axis for the first time. But despite the shock of the last few days, politics will always fill a vacuum \u2014 especially after a political tragedy. Indeed, Trump\u2019s defiance \u2014 he was pictured with blood streaking his face and clenching his fist while Secret Service rushed him offstage Saturday \u2014 was a gesture that is likely to define his career and his life. \u201cA lot of people say it\u2019s the most iconic photo they\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Trump told The New York Post on Sunday. \u201cThey\u2019re right, and I didn\u2019t die. Usually you have to die to have an iconic picture.\u201d It is too early to say how voters will respond to the deeply disturbing events at the Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, or the sitting president\u2019s pledge that he\u2019s fit to serve until January 2029 despite his performance at the debate. But the decisions that each man makes in the coming days and the tone they seek to strike will be critical to how the campaign evolves. One thing about the election likely won\u2019t change. In a nation that was already deeply divided, the core vote for both Trump and Biden was probably locked in. Tens of thousands of voters in a handful of swing states probably still hold the fate of the White House \u2014 and the nation\u2019s future in their hands. Trump\u2019s tactical choices The convention, taking place in the home arena of the Milwaukee Bucks in the critical battleground state of Wisconsin, will formally nominate Trump in the fabled roll call of the states. And the GOP is on alert for him to name his vice presidential pick, after a reality show-style process in which he\u2019s teased out potential ticket mates, including North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance. The ex-president told supporters on Truth Social on Sunday that he\u2019d been planning to delay his trip to Wisconsin by two days, \u201cbut have just decided that I cannot allow a \u2018shooter,\u2019 or potential assassin, to force change to scheduling, or anything else.\u201d Trump has conducted his attempt to regain the White House as a campaign of personal and political vengeance amid his claims that his legal cases, including his conviction in a hush money trial in New York and two pending trials over his attempt to thwart the will of voters in 2020, are proof of political persecution. There can be no justification for an assassination attempt on a candidate \u2014 an assault on democracy. But if the attack on Saturday sprung from a fetid political culture, Trump has been an enthusiastic participant with rhetoric that often seemed to incite violence and that coarsened the public square. This included his racist conspiracy theories about the birthplace of former President Barack Obama and apparent mockery of the injuries suffered by Paul Pelosi, the husband of former Speaker Nancy Pelosi who was attacked with a hammer inside his home. The ex-president\u2019s summoning of protesters to Washington on January 6, 2021, and his call for them to \u201cfight like hell\u201d preceded the assault on the US Capitol and the beating of police officers by his supporters. Trump faces a choice. He could interpret the assassination attempt as a catalyst for less poisoned rhetoric. This could be a politically astute move at a time when many Americans are feeling frightened. His past conduct, however, would mean many voters would struggle to believe him. The alternative course would be to fit the assassination attempt into his claims of personal persecution by an amorphous \u201cleft\u201d that is seeking to crush his political ambitions, end his freedom through the courts and even take his life. (The motivation of the lone gunman who took aim at Trump is so far unclear as the investigations continues.) If Trump reacts to the assault on his life by vowing vengeance, the current political crisis and moment of national upheaval could worsen considerably. Many Republican politicians issued calls for calm and an easing of political rhetoric after the shooting \u2014 as did Democrats. But some GOP lawmakers also seemed to be using their comments to try to shut down criticism of a former president who sought to overturn the 2020 election and who has vowed to seek \u201cretribution\u201d in a second term. Vance, for instance, wrote on X that \u201cthe central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs.\u201d He added: \u201cthat rhetoric led directly to President Trump\u2019s attempted assassination.\u201d \u00a0The choice of Vance for Trump\u2019s running mate would therefore send an unmistakable message. And Johnson accompanied his calls for calm by implying that Democrats\u00a0\u2014 in advancing their arguments against Trump \u2014 had somehow abetted the assassination attempt. \u201cIt\u2019s objective truth that Donald Trump is probably the most persecuted and attacked political figure in history, certainly among presidents, maybe at least since Abraham Lincoln, Civil War era,\u201d the Louisiana Republican told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper. \u201cThat takes a toll, \u2026 When my colleagues go out and say, \u2018Democracy will end, the republic will be in an emergency stage if Donald Trump wins for president,\u2019 it\u2019s just not true.\u201d He added: \u201cWhen they say that kind of rhetoric and they heat it up like that, there are people out there that take these things to heart and act upon them.\u201d Biden\u2019s new political challenge \u2014 and opening Biden now faces one of the most intricate tests of presidential dexterity for years. He is embracing his duty to protect political discourse \u2014 even that of an opponent \u2014 and has called for an investigation of apparent Secret Service failings in the attack. At the same time, he\u2019s trying to revive his own political fortunes by looking presidential, while still taking on Trump. Biden\u2019s flexing of the symbolic power of the office \u2014 and the spotlight on the Republican National Convention this week \u2014 may serve to blunt attention on Democratic anxieties about his prospects, although all it would take to revive public concerns would be more alarmingly shaky public performances. His Oval Office address, while moving, was marked by several of the verbal flubs that Trump has mercilessly mocked and that after the debate disaster have turned every public event into an excruciating examination of his capacity. Biden now faces the difficult decision about when to return to the offensive against Trump \u2014 one that may be conditioned by the tone his rival adopts. But he subtly signaled during his Oval Office address that he will not water down his warnings that his predecessor and possible successor represents a threat to democratic freedoms that define the soul of America. He did so by citing several events in which Trump, his supporters or far-right groups were involved \u2014 mentioning \u201cmembers of Congress of both parties being targeted and shot, or a violent mob attacking the Capitol on January 6, or a brutal attack on the spouse of former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi or \u2026 intimidation on election officials, or the kidnapping plot against a sitting governor (Michigan Democrat Gretchen Whitmer) or an attempted assassination on Donald Trump.\u201d \u201cThere is no place in America for this kind of violence, for any violence ever,\u201d Biden said. His sentiments are shared by many. But bitter experience suggests he may not be the last president to say so.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/politics/2024-campaign-transformed-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Cheatle\u00a0added\u00a0that no assets from the agency\u00a0were diverted from the rally that day,\u00a0even though there were other events in the state on Saturday requiring agency protection. \u201cAt that particular site, we divided up areas of responsibility, but the Secret Service is totally responsible for the design and implementation and the execution of the site,\u201d she told CNN. In a prior interview with ABC News,\u00a0Cheatle\u00a0had said that local law enforcement was responsible for the building where 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks climbed onto the roof and fired shots at Trump at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday. \u201cWhat I was trying to stress was that we just divided up areas of responsibility, and they provided support to those areas of responsibility,\u201d\u00a0Cheatle\u00a0said of local law enforcement, adding that the agency\u00a0\u201ccouldn\u2019t do our job without them.\u201d Although a full advance had been completed that day, the director, said if \u201cthere are things that we need to change about our policies, or our procedures, or our methods, we are certainly going to do so.\u201d Cheatle\u00a0didn\u2019t provide specifics on where the USSS would make adjustments, saying the service is waiting for its own internal review and findings, as well as an external review. CNN asked Cheatle if Trump\u2019s security included a full Secret Service counter-assault team \u2013 the agency\u2019s version of a tactical or SWAT team \u2013 or if it filled gaps with local law enforcement. \u201cHe\u00a0had\u00a0counter-assault\u00a0members,\u201d Cheatle said. \u201cIt varies on\u00a0what\u00a0the\u00a0full\u00a0complement\u00a0is. He\u00a0also\u00a0had\u00a0assistance\u00a0from\u00a0local\u00a0tactical\u00a0teams\u00a0that\u00a0were\u00a0on\u00a0site\u00a0as\u00a0well.\u201d Cheatle did not describe the team as \u201cfull,\u201d but instead said the team size was \u201cnormal.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very nuanced,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cIt depends\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0venue,\u00a0it\u00a0depends\u00a0on\u00a0where\u00a0we\u00a0are. He had a counter-assault\u00a0team\u00a0element\u00a0that\u00a0was\u00a0there,\u201d adding that additional counter-assault assets were provided by local law enforcement. Department of Homeland Security personnel were used at posts as well, she said.  \u201cWe\u00a0were\u00a0actually\u00a0beyond\u00a0the\u00a0numbers\u00a0that\u00a0we\u00a0would\u00a0have\u00a0as\u00a0a\u00a0normal\u00a0compliment,\u201d Cheatle said.  The Secret Service director is facing a flurry of questions about how a gunman was able to get a clear line of sight to Trump at the rally site, and there have been calls from her resignation from some members of Congress, including House Majority Leader Steve Scalise. When asked by CNN if the perimeter at the rally was too small,\u00a0Cheatle\u00a0said it \u201cencompassed the area that we needed to secure the event that we had on that day.\u201d \u201cWhat happened is a terrible incident and should never happen,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd we are obviously going to make sure move forward we take whatever any lessons that come out of this and adjust accordingly.\u201d CNN reported earlier Tuesday that the US obtained intelligence of an Iranian assassination plot targeting Trump, which the gunman did not appear connected to. Asked whether the Secret Service had increased the security it provides to the former president as a result,\u00a0the director said, \u201cWe have been doing that over a series of several months, to include on that day.\u201d Cheatle\u00a0would not, however, say whether\u00a0all elements of the former president\u2019s detail were increased as a result of the threat from Iran. Cheatle\u00a0said she has spoken with a \u201cnumber of our personnel\u201d who worked the day of the rally, adding that she plans to speak with the remainder of the people she hasn\u2019t talked with yet. \u201cThey\u2019re obviously difficult conversations. Everyone works for the Secret Service never wants to have a day like that,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cWe perform our job flawlessly. The people who covered and evacuated the president on that day, the counter sniper \u2013 performed their job flawlessly, and I\u2019m very proud of the actions that they took.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/politics/secret-service-director-interview/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_politics_democratic-national-commitee-joe-biden-virtual-roll-call", "text": "The Democratic National Committee\u00a0is\u00a0moving ahead with\u00a0its\u00a0controversial\u00a0plan to virtually nominate President Joe Biden ahead of the\u00a0Democratic convention\u00a0in Chicago\u00a0next month\u00a0\u2013 ignoring the growing calls from some of the party\u2019s elected officials to ditch that strategy given the serious ongoing debate about whether the president should continue to seek a second term. According to an email sent to members of the convention rules committee within that was obtained by CNN, the committee will proceed with a previously scheduled meeting on Friday to deliberate \u2013 and begin to set in motion \u2013 the steps and timeline for virtually nominating Biden. The letter notably states that \u201cno virtual voting will begin before August 1\u201d \u2013 a new decision that appears aimed at addressing the fury inside the party that was prompted by reporting from CNN and other outlets that some Biden allies have been quietly pushing to fast-track the virtual roll call. Wednesday\u2019s letter, which makes clear that the DNC is doubling down on its virtual nomination plan, now sets up a key deadline for Democrats by which to resolve questions around Biden\u2019s candidacy. While it could be possible for the party to revisit the results of the vote at the convention in Chicago, the DNC has long made clear that it is committed to locking in their nominee before the convention begins \u2013 and specifically before August 7, which, they say, is critical to ensure ballot access in a state like Ohio. \u201cOur discussion on Friday of how the Convention will operate will include discussion of a virtual voting element, which will end before the in-person Convention,\u201d the letter says. \u201cWe will elaborate on the reasoning below as to why a virtual vote is the wisest approach, and will explain how a virtual vote would work.\u201d A growing faction of House Democrats, convinced that Biden is too politically damaged to defeat Donald Trump in November,\u00a0has been\u00a0calling on the DNC to ditch the virtual nomination plans\u00a0altogether, and a draft letter is circulating among Democratic lawmakers calling on the party to slow down the process, as CNN reported. In Wednesday\u2019s letter, the co-chairs of the rules committee alluded to reports of Biden allies hoping to accelerate the virtual roll call, writing: \u201cNo matter what may be reported, our goal is not to fast-track.\u201d \u201cNone of this will be rushed,\u201d they said. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries was involved in the lobbying push by Democrats to delay the DNC\u2019s virtual roll call vote past August 1, according to multiple sources. Jeffries was relaying concerns he was hearing from his members, many of whom were furious that the DNC was considering holding the vote next week. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer also pushed for the delay, according to a source familiar with the matter. Jeffries has publicly maintained he supports Biden atop the ticket, even as panic is growing in Democratic ranks over Biden\u2019s chances. Appearing on \u201cCNN News Central\u201d Wednesday, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a co-chair of the DNC\u2019s rules committee and one of the letter\u2019s authors,\u00a0also\u00a0rejected suggestions that the DNC is trying to fast-track Biden\u2019s nomination. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it behooves us to fall into conspiracy theories. The Republicans have cornered the market on that,\u201d Walz said. \u201cLook, this is the process that we\u2019ve done. There is nothing going to happen on Friday other than to start to set the rules. Again, if our convention would have been held last month, then no one would be talking about this, but we have to get the work done,\u201d he added. He was referring to the initial rationale for the virtual roll call process, which was intended to step around an issue in Ohio that threatened to leave Biden off the ballot in that state if he wasn\u2019t nominated by August 7. Lawmakers in Ohio have since passed a law to make that issue moot, but the DNC has pointed to the potential of a legal challenge by Ohio Republicans for moving forward with the virtual roll call anyway. In his letter, Walz and co-chair Leah Daughtry defend the virtual vote \u201cbecause it ensures ballot access in the states that we need to win in November and avoids potential risks if there is delay in the process.\u201d In addition to Ohio, Walz and Daughtry cite other state deadlines that fall during the in-person convention, some of which they say, require documents to be filed in person. \u201cWe cannot and should not allow these timing complications to jeopardize whether the Democratic ticket appears on the ballot in must-win states,\u201d they say. Democratic Rep. Lloyd\u00a0Doggett, who was the first House member to publicly call for Biden to drop out, said Wednesday that the DNC should drop the push for virtual roll call. \u201cMy call for President Biden to step aside remains even more urgent. Our decision must consider the reality of steadily, worsening poll numbers, not just more wishful thinking. The risk of Trump tyranny is so great that we must put forward our strongest nominee.\u201d He added of the\u00a0DNC: \u201cFast-forwarding the nomination process is no way to convince the many unconvinced voters in the growing number of battleground states.\u00a0Those so eager to overly protect President Biden ignore his own words inviting anyone questioning his nomination to do so at the Convention.\u201d Rep. Jared\u00a0Huffman, a progressive Democrat from California, told CNN on Tuesday that there is a \u201cgrowing number of members\u201d concerned about the virtual roll call vote, calling it a \u201cterrible idea\u201d and a \u201cdumb thing.\u201d \u201cIf the election were held today, he would get crushed,\u201d\u00a0Huffman\u00a0said of Biden. \u201cWe have got to do something about it.\u201d A spokesperson for Huffman\u00a0told CNN that in light of the DNC letter to hold a virtual roll call in August, they will not be sending their formal letter calling on the party to delay nominating Biden that was circulated earlier this week. Huffman had drafted a letter to House Democrats to delay Biden\u2019s nomination until delegates gathered at the convention. The spokesperson said that the California congressman is pleased to see the pressure members were putting on the DNC not to hold a virtual roll call by the end of July was successful.

{"id": "2024_07_17_politics_kfile-jd-vance-abortion-comments", "text": "Former President Donald Trump\u2019s running mate, JD Vance, said two-and-a-half years ago he was open to a national abortion ban, a stark contrast to comments he made this week where the Ohio senator said he adhered to Trump\u2019s view that abortion should be a state issue. Vance argued in 2022 that people seeking abortions would travel from states where abortion is banned to states with liberal abortion laws, necessitating federal action. \u201cI certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally,\u201d Vance said in January 2022 on a podcast when running for Senate. On Monday, the Ohio senator said he adhered to Trump\u2019s view that abortion was a state issue, though in practice that means abortion can be banned in one state and entirely protected in another. \u201cMy view is that Donald Trump is the leader of the Republican Party, and his views on abortion are going to be the views that dominate this party and drive this party forward,\u201d Vance said to Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity on Monday. \u201cAlabama\u2019s going to make a different decision from California. That is a reasonable thing. And that\u2019s how I think we build some bridges and have some respect for one another.\u201d Since the Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 Dobbs decision overturned the constitutional right to abortion, voters have consistently supported abortion rights in state measures, and the 2022 midterm elections saw numerous anti-abortion Republicans defeated. Many Republicans, including Vance, have shifted or moderated their abortion positions to align with the current political climate, where anti-abortion rhetoric and policies are seen as increasingly toxic and detrimental to election success. After Ohio voters approved a constitutional amendment to protect abortion rights in 2023, effectively repealing the state\u2019s six-week ban, Vance critiqued the Republican Party\u2019s messaging on abortion. \u201cWe have to recognize how much voters mistrust us (meaning elected Republicans) on this issue,\u201d he wrote in a post on X. Vance\u2019s office pointed CNN to past statements on abortion from Vance as a senator, including one from CNN last December where he said, \u201cWe have to accept that people do not want blanket abortion bans.\u201d He also expressed support for exceptions in the case of the \u201clife of the mother, for rape, and so forth.\u201d Vance once supported a \u201cnational minimum standard\u201d for abortion restrictions and signaled support for a 15-week federal abortion ban to CNN before determining there was no appetite for it in the current climate. Yet in January 2022, Vance argued that while lawmakers couldn\u2019t ban abortion in the current climate, he was sympathetic to the view that a national ban was necessary. Vance proposed a hypothetical scenario where if Roe vs. Wade was overturned and Ohio banned abortion by 2024, liberal mega donor and philanthropist George Soros \u2014 a popular bogeyman in conservative circles might then facilitate abortions for \u201cdisproportionately black women\u201d by flying them to California. \u201cI\u2019m sympathetic to the view that like, okay, look here, here\u2019s a situation \u2014 let\u2019s say Roe vs. Wade is overruled. Ohio bans abortion, in 2022 or let\u2019s say 2024. And then, you know, every day George Soros sends a 747 to Columbus to load up disproportionately black women to get them to go have abortions in California. And of course, the left will celebrate this as a victory for diversity \u2014 uh, that\u2019s kind of creepy.\u201d \u201cAnd, and it\u2019s like, if that happens, do you need some federal response to prevent it from happening?\u201d Vance said, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sympathetic to that actually. So, you know, how hopefully we get to a point where Ohio bans abortion in California and the Soroses of the world respect it.\u201d \u201cThe left has this weird desire to conquer everything, right? So I tend to think that these balances are always a little tenuous and eventually, either on any given issue, the left is gonna win or we\u2019re gonna win,\u201d he concluded. On Monday, delegates at the Republican National Convention approved their party\u2019s new platform with toned-down rhetoric on abortion that aligned with Trump\u2019s state-based approach to the issue. The move has angered some anti-abortion groups who opposed abandoning the party\u2019s old long-standing language, including the de-emphasis on abortion restrictions.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/kfile-jd-vance-abortion-comments/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_politics_biden-urge-supreme-court-student-loan-repayment-plan", "text": "The Biden administration asked the Supreme Court on Wednesday to let it continue cutting monthly student loan payments for roughly three million borrowers enrolled in a student loan repayment plan implemented last year. The fate of the program, known as SAVE (Saving on a Valuable Education), is in flux as lower courts consider two legal challenges to it. Earlier this month, a group of three GOP-led states behind one of those challenges\u00a0asked the high court to maintain a partial block on the program\u00a0while the states\u2019 larger legal challenge to it unfolds. A Denver-based appeals court later allowed the Biden administration to move forward with the program, which it began implementing this month. The Biden administration originally began phasing in the student loan repayment plan last year, before it was temporarily paused amid the legal challenges. Lawyers for the Biden administration told the high court on Wednesday that it should keep in place the order that let the program move forward. They argue that \u201cborrowers would stand to suffer significant and irreparable harm\u201d and many would \u201cexperience intense confusion\u201d about the status of their loans if the court blocked the administration from lowering their monthly payments as planned. Many borrowers have already seen their monthly payments decrease and it would take at least several months for the administration to recalculate them, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said in court papers. Prelogar argued that the \u201cwidespread harm\u201d that would come to borrowers if the court sides with the states outweighs any harm the states may experience as a result of the program staying in effect while litigation plays out. \u201cTo revert to the pre-SAVE plan approach, the Department and its servicers would have to reprogram their systems, retrain their staff, and recalculate monthly payments,\u201d she wrote, arguing that the Department of Education would also be harmed if the freeze were lifted. SAVE is one of the Biden administration\u2019s key student loan policies. The Department of Education implemented the repayment plan last year after the Supreme Court struck down the administration\u2019s sweeping, one-time student loan forgiveness program in 2023. SAVE is currently the government\u2019s most generous student loan repayment plan. Low-income borrowers enrolled in SAVE can see lower monthly payments and a faster path to student loan forgiveness than those enrolled in other repayment plans. Since SAVE was launched last year, about 8 million people have enrolled and 4.6 million of them have a $0 monthly payment. Currently, those enrolled in SAVE can still benefit from the plan while the lawsuits play out. But any further student loan forgiveness under the plan has been put on hold by a lower court in a separate case. Under the plan\u2019s rules, borrowers can be eligible for debt forgiveness after making a certain number of payments.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/biden-urge-supreme-court-student-loan-repayment-plan/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Malinconico is\u00a0an independent\u00a0and a\u00a0college geology professor in Northampton\u00a0County, Pennsylvania, a bellwether area in one of the nation\u2019s most\u00a0competitive presidential battlegrounds. \u201cI\u2019m extremely\u00a0concerned,\u201d Malinconico said just after the\u00a0CNN debate Thursday night. \u201cPresident Biden performed poorly, His voice was weak. He stumbled and had difficulty staying on track with his answers.\u201d Still, he\u00a0cannot fathom the alternative and ended his debate night take with this: \u201cDespite my significant\u00a0concerns about Biden\u2019s\u00a0capabilities,\u00a0I will still vote against Trump.\u201d But early Friday afternoon, Malinconico reached out to add this: \u201cAfter sleeping on the debate overnight \u2026 now I\u2019m much more in favor of supporting moves to have President Biden drop out or for an open (brokered perhaps)\u00a0convention.\u201d It was one of a flood of voter reactions highly\u00a0critical of the president\u2019s debate performance, and one of several suggesting the debate, at least in the short term, damaged the incumbent\u2019s standing with voters\u00a0critical to his reelection\u00a0 hopes. Pat Levin is another\u00a0Northampton\u00a0County resident. The 94-year-old told us when we first met a few months ago that she was not worried about Biden\u2019s age. She is still planning to vote Biden, but her reaction was also quite telling. Levin had nice things to say about Vice President Kamala Harris and\u00a0California Gov. Gavin Newsom, praising their interviews after the debate. \u201cNothing good to say,\u201d though, about Biden \u2013 and the overall substance of the\u00a0CNN Presidential Debate. \u201cBiden whispered, spoke haltingly and appeared exceedingly vulnerable,\u201d Levin, told\u00a0CNN in a text message. \u201cIt was a sad night for American politics.\u201d Michael Pesce, a self-described Reagan Republican who says he\u00a0cannot support Trump, offered a similar take. \u201cLast night was a horror show,\u201d Pesce said Friday. \u201cBiden looked old and doddering and not at all presidential. Trump was angry and bombastic\u00a0and unable to say anything truthful.\u201d Pesce told us in May he would reluctantly vote for Biden because he sees Trump as unfit for the presidency. His morning after debate take was telling \u2013 and, again, troublesome for Biden. \u201cThe Democrats need to have an open\u00a0convention and rally behind a much younger\u00a0candidate,\u201d Pesce said. Pesce, 60, lives in Bucks\u00a0County in the\u00a0Philadelphia\u00a0suburbs, and like Northampton, is a battleground within the battleground. Malinconico, Levin and Pesce are participating in a\u00a0CNN project designed to track the 2024\u00a0campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in the\u00a0 battlegrounds and are part of\u00a0critical voting blocs. There are 60 voters participating so far, across 10 states, and they are diverse in every way. But the overwhelming\u00a0consensus after the debate, from Democrats and Republicans alike, was that Biden\u2019s showing was alarming. \u201cI\u2019m really scared that if Biden stays on the ticket, Trump is going to win,\u201d said Davette Baker, an African American and longtime Democratic\u00a0organizer in Milwaukee. And while strong Trump supporters were happy with his performance, the former president, too, faced some harsh\u00a0criticism from many of our voters, even\u00a0Republicans. \u201cSame old Donald, talked about himself,\u201d said Matt Vrahiotes, a\u00a0Christian\u00a0conservative who owns a small winery in Hall\u00a0County, Georgia. \u201cStroked his ego.\u201d Still,\u00a0Vrahiotes said Trump \u201cseems to be more\u00a0cognitive and mentally sharper.\u201d When we first\u00a0met, Vrahiotes said he would\u00a0consider a third party option, and his after the debate take reflected his\u00a0continued despair at the major party\u00a0choices. \u201cWhy not allow Kennedy on stage,\u201d he said of independent\u00a0candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who failed to meet the\u00a0CNN debate\u00a0criteria. Four big takeaways from our voters: \u2013\u2013 Those already unhappy with their\u00a0choices\u00a0came away from the debate even more sour about a Biden-Trump rematch. \u201cI hate that Trump talks down about America,\u2019\u201d said Antonio Munoz, a veteran who owns a Las Vegas restaurant and\u00a0catering business. \u201cI\u2019m not motivated to vote. Biden\u2019s\u00a0closing was weak.\u201d \u2013\u2013 Younger voters who align with Biden on many issues but feel little\u00a0connection with him because of his age were taken aback by his performance. \u201cI was genuinely shocked,\u201d said\u00a0Christine Ngyuen, 29, a former nurse who recently opened a Boba tea house in the Atlanta suburb of Decatur. \u201cBoth of our\u00a0candidates are far too old to be doing what they are doing,\u201d said Summer Matkin, a student at Wayne State University who lives in the Detroit suburbs. \u2014 Committed Democrats who plan to vote for Biden regardless of his performance still voiced exasperation because the debate reinforced their worries Trump\u00a0could win the election. \u201cIt felt like he let Trump drive a dangerously false narrative and\u00a0could do nothing more than say, \u2018That\u2019s a lie\u2019 without fully establishing the truth strongly,\u201d said Anushka Jalistagi, a recent University of Michigan graduate and former\u00a0co-president of the\u00a0campus\u00a0College\u00a0Democrats. \u2014 Trump supporters approved of his debate performance but there was no evidence in our group that he gained support. \u201cSad. We don\u2019t have the sharpest tacks in the box to vote for,\u201d said Kim\u00a0Cavaliere, a nurse in suburban Atlanta who is undecided and unhappy with her\u00a0choices. \u201cI bet other\u00a0countries are laughing at us. I was.\u201d Ibrahim Ghazal, a Palestinian-American law student from the Detroit area, is angry with Biden over the Hamas-Israel\u00a0conflict and leaning against voting for him again. But he had a dim view of Trump before the debate, and a dimmer one after. \u201cTrump had much better stage presence than Biden,\u201d Ghazal said in a text Friday. \u201cWhat was most disturbing to me was that Trump used the word \u2018Palestinian\u2019 as a slur.\u201d This was Trump during an exchange about the Hamas-Israel\u00a0conflict: \u201cYou should let them go and let them finish the job. He doesn\u2019t want to do it. He has become like a Palestinian. But, they don\u2019t like him because he is a very bad Palestinian. He is a weak one.\u201d Linda Rooney, a registered Republican who lives just\u00a0outside of Philadelphia,\u00a0voted for Biden in 2020 but said this year she would either \u201chold my nose\u201d and vote for Trump or write in a\u00a0conservative. There are 18 weeks left in the\u00a0campaign, but Trump\u2019s debate showing\u00a0did not win a\u00a0commitment from Rooney. \u201cLast night\u2019s debate was a disaster for Biden but what scares me more is that the Republicans\u00a0can\u2019t say they have a good\u00a0candidate either,\u201d she said. \u201cHow did my party get to the point where the only way we may win the presidency again is because we are up against someone who is feeble and not well? \u2026 Republicans should not be taking\u00a0a victory lap.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/politics/voters-trump-biden-debate-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Even though anger and panic\u00a0have\u00a0been steadily rising inside the Democratic Party for nearly three weeks, after\u00a0the president\u2019s\u00a0alarming debate performance in Atlanta, the White House and the Biden campaign are in a new place, multiple Democratic officials told CNN. \u201cThe private conversations with the Hill are continuing,\u201d a senior Democratic adviser told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid alienating the campaign and the White House. \u201cHe\u2019s being receptive. Not as defiant as he is publicly.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s gone from saying, \u2018Kamala can\u2019t win,\u2019 to \u2018Do you think Kamala can win? \u201c the adviser said. \u201cIt\u2019s still unclear where he\u2019s going to land but seems to be listening.

The developments come at a crucial time for the Biden campaign. ABC News\u2019 Jonathan Karl reported earlier Wednesday that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told Biden on Saturday that it would be best if Biden bowed out of the presidential race. In a statement responding to the ABC News reporting, a Schumer spokesperson said, \u201cUnless ABC\u2019s source is Senator Chuck\u00a0Schumer\u00a0or President Joe Biden the reporting is idle speculation. Leader\u00a0Schumer\u00a0conveyed the views of his caucus directly to President Biden on Saturday.\u201d What that statement did not say, however, was three important words that Schumer has included every time he is asked whether Biden\u2019s candidacy should proceed: \u201cI\u2019m with Joe.\u201d The private meeting between Schumer and Biden, which was held at the president\u2019s beach house Saturday in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, is seen by Democratic officials as one of the most important moments in this escalating drama. Earlier Wednesday, Rep. Adam Schiff, who\u2019s running for Senate in California, became the latest high profile member of Biden\u2019s party to call on the president to exit the race, the first congressional Democrat to do so publicly following the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump.

Biden is finalizing plans to propose major structural changes to the third branch of government. From a report by CNN\u2019s MJ Lee and Devan Cole: Biden\u2019s move is a long time coming for progressives and Democrats who have been pushing for court reform based on the following evidence: \u25ba Citing an election year in 2016, Republicans delayed the appointment of a successor to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, refusing to hold a hearing for President Barack Obama\u2019s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland, now Biden\u2019s attorney general. \u25ba Ignoring their own election year precedent, Republicans rushed through the appointment of a successor to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, creating a new 6-3 majority of Republican-appointed justices that could last for decades. \u25ba That new majority went in the opposite direction of public opinion, upending decades of precedent and reversing a federal constitutional right to an abortion. \u25ba The conservative majority has also taken a more active role in striking down environmental policy while granting a form of superimmunity to presidents and reinterpreting the 2nd Amendment. \u25ba Justice Clarence Thomas has been found to have accepted multiple gifts from billionaire friends. \u25ba Thomas did not recuse himself from January 6, 2021, cases even though his wife actively worked with White House officials pushing for Trump\u2019s effort to overturn the election. \u25ba Justices have ignored calls that they impose a binding ethics code on themselves. Biden has long opposed Supreme Court reform. In 1983, as a senator, Biden called Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s plan to place term limits on older justices and expand the size of the court \u201cboneheaded.\u201d He may still feel that way. Biden\u2019s proposal does not appear to include an expansion of the size of the court, although Congress has made the court larger and smaller multiple times. In 2020, during the Democratic primary, he was a voice against calls to reform the court, arguing that adding or subtracting justices would ruin its credibility. Instead, he promised to commission a panel to explore the issue. That commission \u2013 The Presidential Commission on the Supreme Court of the United States \u2013 issued its final report years ago, in December 2021. It explored various proposals for court reform, including expansion and term limits, but did not endorse any of them. It is very clear from the report that Congress has been fighting over the Supreme Court for all of US history. Commission members, who came from a breadth of ideologies, were split on whether Congress has the power to simply create a system of term limits for justices. There would also be obstacles to implementing the system over the course of years. There is historical precedent for expanding and contracting the court, on the other hand. The most notable effort to expand the court \u2013 opponents call it court packing \u2013 came from Franklin D. Roosevelt, who became frustrated when the Supreme Court of the day struck down New Deal policies. The report notes that while the court packing plan was ultimately defeated in Congress, the threat of changing the court clearly changed its behavior, what\u2019s known as a \u201cdoctrinal shift.\u201d From the Commission: Roosevelt\u2019s plan, unlike anything Biden is likely to propose, had some chance of passing. Roosevelt\u2019s Democrats had a filibuster-proof majority of 69 votes in 1937. Biden\u2019s Democrats are barely in the majority at the moment. Any Biden proposal would almost certainly be squashed by the Republican minority in the Senate if it were to come up for consideration this year. Next year, Republicans may hold power in the White House and the Senate with hopes to appoint new, young conservative justices, not modify the court.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/bidens-41-year-evolution-on-supreme-court-reform/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_politics_senate-seat-ohio-jd-vance", "text": "The Senate is narrowly divided and Democrats hold a slim majority. But there\u2019s no need for Ohio Sen. JD Vance, whom former President Donald Trump selected as his running mate Monday, to leave the chamber during the campaign. It makes sense to look to a senator as vice president: The role\u2019s main official duty is to serve as president of the US Senate, although recent vice presidents don\u2019t tend to spend too much time on Capitol Hill. In fact, there is a long history of presidential candidates selecting senators as running mates. President Joe Biden was at the end of a long career as a US senator from Delaware when he was tapped as then-Sen. Barack Obama\u2019s running mate in 2008.\u00a0Biden and Obama both continued to serve in the Senate during the campaign, as did Sen. John McCain, the Arizonan who was Republicans\u2019 pick that year. Biden picked then-Sen. Kamala Harris as his own running mate in 2020. In 2016, Hillary Clinton picked Sen. Tim Kaine as her running mate. Kaine never gave up his seat and went back to serving as a senator after Clinton\u2019s loss to Trump.\u00a0In 2004, then-Sen. John Kerry, a Democrat, picked then-Sen. John Edwards as his running mate. So what does that mean for the seat? Usually, when a senator is elected as either president or vice president, they will resign from their Senate seat in early January after the election. Biden, however, is an outlier in this. He kept his Senate seat longer than most in early 2009, perhaps so that he could\u00a0edge past some other former senators\u00a0in the all-time Senate tenure list.\u00a0Biden sits\u00a0at No. 19. Vance\u00a0won his seat\u00a0in the Senate in 2022 and won\u2019t be up for reelection as a senator until 2028. If he and Trump win in November, Vance would need to resign before taking the oath of office on January 20. It would then fall to Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, himself a former senator, to appoint a replacement until the\u00a0next regular state election, when there would be a special election to fill the rest of the term. This can be a fraught process. Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich went to federal prison for essentially trying to trade away the appointment to fill out Obama\u2019s term. For Biden, longtime aide and friend Ted Kaufman was appointed in 2009 to succeed him in the Senate. Kaufman did not run for the seat in his own right. California Gov. Gavin Newsom appointed Sen. Alex Padilla to succeed Harris in the Senate, and Padilla has since been elected to the seat.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/politics/senate-seat-ohio-jd-vance/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_politics_student-loan-debt-bankruptcy", "text": "More student loan borrowers have successfully received debt relief through bankruptcy after the Biden administration implemented a new policy to make the process easier nearly two years ago, according to data released by the Department of Justice Wednesday. A total of 588 people filed cases seeking student debt discharges through bankruptcy between October 2023 and March \u2014 a 36% increase from the prior six-month period. As of March, a total of 1,220 new cases had been filed since the new federal guidance was put in place. Of cases decided by the courts during that time, 98% have provided a full or partial student debt discharge. Previously, a student debt discharge was largely out of reach for people going through the bankruptcy process because \u2014 unlike credit card, medical and other consumer debts \u2014 borrowers must show that paying off the student debt would cause them \u201cundue hardship.\u201d Removing that legal requirement would require an act of Congress.\u00a0But the federal guidance put in place in November 2022 simplified the burdensome process of showing undue hardship and made it easier for government lawyers to recommend to courts that the debt be discharged. \u201cThe results are clear: this guidance has helped make the promise of a fresh start in bankruptcy a meaningful option for individuals weighed down by student loan debt,\u201d acting associate attorney general Benjamin C. Mizer said in a statement. Some consumer advocates say that even though there\u2019s been an increase in student loan borrowers seeking debt relief through bankruptcy, the number of people doing so pales in comparison to how many may be eligible for a discharge. In May, Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren and Sheldon Whitehouse urged a government watchdog group to ramp up its education efforts so that borrowers, attorneys, and courts understand the new guidance. A quarter of a million people with student loans file for bankruptcy each year, said Aaron Ament, president of the National Student Legal Defense Network. \u201cWe are happy to see some progress in addressing a broken system, but successfully supporting a tiny fraction of those borrowers is not a cause to declare \u2018mission accomplished\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s a sign of how much work remains,\u201d Ament said. As the November election approaches, the Biden administration has been eager to show voters how it has relieved student debt burdens for millions of borrowers. Even though the Supreme Court struck down President Joe Biden\u2019s signature, one-time student debt forgiveness program last year, the administration has used other means to successfully cancel student loans for about 4.75 million people.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/student-loan-debt-bankruptcy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}

McIver was among 11 Democrats running in the state\u2019s 10th Congressional District to serve out the remaining term of the late Democratic Rep. Donald Payne Jr. The seat, which includes parts of Newark and Jersey City and the nearby suburbs, is the most Democratic in the state. Joe Biden would have carried it under its current lines by 60 points in 2020, making McIver the favorite against Republican Carmen Bucco in the special general election on September 18.

{"id": "2024_07_15_politics_vance-trump-political-heir-analysis", "text": "JD Vance is the embodiment of the populist, nationalist and blue-collar transformation of the old establishment Republican Party. That\u2019s why ex-President Donald Trump \u2014 who never forgets the enthusiasms of his base \u2014 picked the Ohio senator as his vice-presidential running mate and effectively named him as a political heir who is now the best positioned Republican to inherit the keys to the MAGA kingdom whenever Trump exits. Trump rarely comes across as someone preoccupied with posterity \u2014 he lives in the present. But the selection of Vance is a nod to his legacy and anoints a leader of the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement who could be active long after its author has left the scene. Perhaps it\u2019s no coincidence that Trump chose an heir apparent a few days after surviving an assassination attempt \u2014 a horrific event that underscored the constitutional duty of vice presidents to secure the chain of power and assume the presidency themselves if the worst happens. The Ohio senator, who is only 39, injects a dash of youth into an election season dominated by two elderly men who have both been elected president. His selection caps a stunning political rise \u2014 he\u2019s been in the Senate for less than two years. And if Trump wins the election in November, a millennial will be a heartbeat away from the presidency. Vance made his name by explaining the political forces behind the rise of Trumpism before most people were paying attention to them in his book \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d about growing up poor in Appalachia. The memoir describes human blight, economic pain and drug addiction sown by deindustrialization and globalization in Kentucky and Ohio. Eight years ago, he was often sought out by liberal commentators looking to understand Trumpism\u2019s populist appeal. In many ways, his quintessential American story is the antidote to Trump\u2019s biography. Unlike his new boss, he didn\u2019t come from wealth \u2014 he\u2019s a self-made man who rose from the lowliest of circumstances, heading to the Ohio State University, to service with the Marine Corps in Iraq and graduating with top honors from Yale Law School. Vance is exceedingly smart and eloquent and makes a case for Trumpism and his party\u2019s revolutionary departure from its internationalist, corporate roots in a way that Trump, who operates on emotion and feral political instincts, embodies but rarely intellectualizes. From Never Trumper to true believer But Vance was not always on the Trump train. He was an early, self-declared \u201cNever Trumper\u201d who once called the ex-president \u201cnoxious.\u201d Critics, therefore, accuse him of opportunism and of trashing his beliefs to become one of Trump\u2019s most vocal sycophants in the pursuit of power. The Ohio Republican has turned on the establishment and elite academe that helped make his name with the vehemence that only a defector can muster. But he has explained that he was wrong about Trump and now believes that he was a great president. Since Trump left the White House, Vance has emerged as one of his most vehement defenders and has enthusiastically embraced the idea that the ex-president is the victim of weaponized justice. He has also downplayed the assault on the US Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters on January 6, 2021, and in an interview with CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins earlier this year, cast doubt on the facts of the most flagrant attack on American democracy of the modern age. \u201cI\u2019m extremely skeptical that Mike Pence\u2019s life was ever in danger. I think \u2026\u00a0in politics, people like to really exaggerate things, from time to time,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of folks, in the Democratic Party act as if January the 6 was the scariest moment of their lives.\u201d Vance went on: \u201cJanuary 6 was a bad day. It was a riot. But the idea that Donald Trump endangered anyone\u2019s lives, when he told them to protest peacefully, it\u2019s just absurd.\u201d But while Vance may juice MAGA turnout, he could alienate the critical suburban voters in swing states, especially women, who usually decide US elections, especially with his hardline position on abortion. Trump critics are also seizing on the pick to question Trump\u2019s commitment to his new unity message after he escaped the assassination attempt. Vance responded with the most searing reaction of any Republican. He claimed that President Joe Biden\u2019s arguments that Trump was an \u201cauthoritarian fascist\u201d led to the attempt to kill him, despite the motive of the gunman being unclear. There is always intense debate about how much a vice-presidential nominee really matters in an electoral context and whether such picks really help put a ticket over the top. But the Vance move makes a lot of sense when Biden\u2019s own team has said his best path to a second term runs through the Blue Wall states. Most assessments of the electoral map suggest Biden must at a minimum win those states \u2013 Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2013 and add a single electoral vote in the Omaha, Nebraska, area to get to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. Vance has a particular talent for talking to voters in the post-industrial Midwest. He won his Senate seat by more than 6 points in 2022 and he is an avatar for the political forces that turned the Buckeye State into a Republican bastion after years as a political bellwether. Why European allies won\u2019t relish the Vance pick The new Republican vice-presidential pick is also the embodiment of Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies abroad and augurs another rocky period between the US and its European allies if the ex-president reclaims the Oval Office. He is in the vanguard of a new generation of pro-Trump lawmakers who reject the traditional US foreign policy consensus. He traveled to the belly of the internationalist beast at the Munich Security Conference earlier this year to rebuke America\u2019s European allies. And at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in the US, he explained why he thinks America should no longer finance Ukraine\u2019s fight for its freedom. \u201cI have \u2026 Republican colleagues, who are much more emotionally invested in what\u2019s going on 6,000 miles away than they are in their own country,\u201d Vance said at the conference. He backs Trump\u2019s position that the war in Ukraine should end and the killing should stop. \u201cIt\u2019s good for the country to have somebody saying, \u2018How long does this go on? How much money are we supposed to funnel into this country?\u2019\u201d said Vance, who has also argued the US lacks the manufacturing capacity or sufficient military reserves to send more ammunition to Ukraine. \u201cIf you care about Ukraine, but most importantly, if you care about America, you should be wanting this thing to come to some diplomatic resolution.\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky rebuked Vance\u2019s criticism of the war in an interview with CNN\u2019s Collins in February. \u201cTo understand it is to come to the front line to see what\u2019s going on, to speak with the people, then to go to civilians to understand \u2026 what will (happen to) them without this support. And he will understand that millions \u2026 will be killed. It\u2019s a fact,\u201d Zelensky said. \u201cOf course, he doesn\u2019t understand. God bless you don\u2019t have the war on your territory,\u201d he said. But Vance is listening to Trump, not Zelensky or the foreign policy establishment. It\u2019s not hard to imagine him deep in the West Wing as vice president implementing the hardline \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda at home and abroad, almost like a modern day \u2014 and far more populist \u2014 version of former Vice President Dick Cheney in the Bush administration. Ultimately, Trump is clearly comfortable with Vance, a favorite of his firebrand son Donald Trump Jr. They are cut from the same ideological and temperamental cloth \u2014 unlike the ex-president and his first vice presidential pick, the pious Mike Pence, who eventually broke with Trump on January 6 after concluding he lacked the constitutional power to throw the 2020 election to his boss. \u201cI think he was a good president. And I think that he made the country more prosperous. And I think he made the world more peaceful,\u201d Vance said of his future ticket mate in his interview with Collins, saying,\u00a0 \u201cWhat gives me pause is another four years of Biden\u2019s administration, where he\u2019s opened the borders, and where you have, effectively a conflict, a major world conflict in nearly every continent in the world.\u201d There is little distance between Vance and Trump. The Ohio senator made sure of that and it\u2019s made him one of the most significant rising powers in American politics.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/politics/vance-trump-political-heir-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}

In private messages, he wondered ahead of Trump\u2019s election whether he was \u201cAmerica\u2019s Hitler\u201d and in 2017 said the then-president\u00a0was a\u00a0\u201cmoral disaster.\u201d In public, he agreed Trump was a \u201ctotal fraud\u201d who didn\u2019t care about regular people and called him \u201creprehensible.\u201d \u201cI go back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical asshole like Nixon who wouldn\u2019t be that bad (and might even prove useful) or that he\u2019s America\u2019s Hitler,\u201d Vance wrote in a message to a friend\u00a0in 2016. \u201cHow\u2019s that for discouraging?\u201d In 2016 and 2017, Vance, then best-known for penning the best-selling book \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d said Trump was \u201ccultural heroin\u201d and \u201cjust another opioid\u201d\u00a0for Middle America. He told CNN ahead of the 2016 election that he was \u201cdefinitely not\u201d voting for Trump and he also contemplated voting for Hillary Clinton (he ultimately said he planned to vote for independent candidate Evan McMullin.) \u201cFellow Christians, everyone is watching us when we apologize for this man. Lord help us,\u201d\u00a0he tweeted\u00a0after the\u00a0\u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d\u00a0tape was published in 2016. Vance also\u00a0liked tweets\u00a0that said Trump committed \u201cserial sexual assault,\u201d called him \u201cone of USA\u2019s most hated, villainous, douchey celebs,\u201d and harshly criticized Trump\u2019s response to the deadly 2017 White nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. \u201cThere is no moral equivalence between the anti-racist protestors in Charlottesville and the killer (and his ilk),\u201d Vance\u00a0wrote in\u00a0a deleted-tweet. Trump\u2019s vice president announcement on Monday caps a dramatic reversal on Vance\u2019s part. He made his most critical remarks when he was promoting his memoir\u00a0\u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d\u00a0\u00a0which was published in 2016. The book had catapulted him to fame as a \u201cTrump whisperer,\u201d capable of explaining Trump\u2019s appeal to the White working class. \u201cI\u2019m definitely not gonna vote for Trump\u00a0because I think that he\u2019s projecting very complex problems onto simple villains,\u201d Vance told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper ahead of the 2016 election. But by 2020, Vance fully embraced Trump, telling podcaster Megyn Kelly after the election he voted for him. A year\u00a0later,\u00a0Vance announced he was running for Senate in Ohio and vied for Trump\u2019s endorsement, which he ultimately received. But at the beginning of that campaign, Vance was\u00a0forced to apologize\u00a0after CNN resurfaced old tweets from the 2016 campaign and early in 2017 in Trump\u2019s administration that he had deleted. \u201cI did say those critical things and I regret them, and I regret being wrong about the guy,\u201d Vance told Fox News\u00a0in 2021.\u00a0 In a\u00a0statement to CNN last month, Vance cited Trump\u2019s \u201cmany successes in office\u201d for changing his mind on\u00a0the former president. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be one of his strongest supporters in the Senate today and I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to ensure President Trump wins in November - the survival of America depends on it.\u201d Vance won his Senate race in 2022 by\u00a06 percentage points\u00a0\u2013 less than the\u00a08.1 percentage points Trump\u00a0won the state\u00a0by\u00a0in 2020. Vance\u2019s remarkable political evolution underscores the broader trend of realignment in the country and the GOP as the party becomes one of\u00a0working-class\u00a0White\u00a0voters. \u2018I\u00a0don\u2019t think he actually cares about folks\u2019 In comments promoting his book, Vance often said Trump played\u00a0to\u00a0or exploited\u00a0White\u00a0working-class\u00a0voters\u2019 fears and prejudices. \u201cAnd I cannot stand Trump because I think he\u2019s a fraud,\u201d\u00a0one radio host said\u00a0to Vance when promoting his book in 2016. \u201cI think he\u2019s a total fraud that is exploiting these people.\u201d \u201cI do too. And it\u2019s like you, like you said, I, I agree with you on Trump because I don\u2019t think that he\u2019s the person. I don\u2019t think he actually cares about folks,\u201d Vance said. \u201cI think he just recognizes that there was a hole in the conversation and that hole is that people from these regions of the country, they feel ignored.\u201d In\u00a0September 2016, Vance argued Trump\u2019s immigration policies like the \u201cgreat Mexican Wall,\u201d were overly simplistic and aimed to give folks something to latch on to. \u201cAt the heart of Trump\u2019s immigration message is that if we had less immigration, we would have much better jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a lot more complicated than that. My own sense is that Trump definitely simplifies these problems. I don\u2019t think if you build a great Mexican wall, all of a sudden, all of these steel mill jobs are going to come back to southern Ohio, but it at least gives people something to latch onto.\u201d Vance also argued in 2016 that if White working-class people attended church, they would not be as attracted to Trump. \u201cI think Trump provides that sense of community that many in the White working class would have, if they actually went to church,\u201d Vance\u00a0told\u00a0New York public radio. \u201cI think if folks went to church a little bit more, they may not be as excited or as attracted to the sort of social experience that Trump provides.\u201d Vance once said racism played a role in Trump support Vance also said that racism and xenophobia played a role in Trump\u2019s rise. \u201cThere is definitely an element of Donald Trump\u2019s support that has its basis in racism, xenophobia, but a lot of these folks are just really hardworking people who are struggling in really important ways,\u201d Vance\u00a0said\u00a0in a September 2016\u00a0\u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d\u00a0Interview. \u201cDefinitely some people who voted for Trump were racist and they voted for him for racist reasons,\u201d Vance\u00a0said\u00a0in an interview at the University of Chicago\u2019s Institute of Politics. Speaking with CNN in October 2016, Vance criticized Trump for\u00a0\u201cactively antagonizing\u201d\u00a0Black voters, claiming this tactic was a long-standing Republican strategy. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that Donald Trump doesn\u2019t speak to issues of special concern of minority voters or Black voters, it\u2019s that he seems to like actively antagonizing a lot of the Black voters,\u201d Vance\u00a0said during a panel discussion. In a July 2016 interview with American Conservative, a right-leaning publication, he added Trump was making the problem of racial resentment \u201cworse\u201d by talking about \u201crapist immigrants and banning all Muslims\u201d as part of his message. To that end \u2013 Vance once tweeted he found Trump reprehensible. \u201cTrump makes people I care about afraid. Immigrants, Muslims, etc. Because of this I find him reprehensible. God wants better of us,\u201d\u00a0he wrote in October 2016.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/politics/kfile-jd-vance-comments-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_politics_adam-schiff-joe-biden-congress", "text": "Rep. Adam Schiff on Wednesday became the most prominent elected Democrat to publicly call on President Joe Biden to drop out of the race. The announcement by Schiff, who is running for US Senate in California, makes him the first Democrat to urge Biden to step aside since the failed assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump over the weekend. Schiff\u2019s call also is notable as he, unlike many of the other Democrats who have so far publicly called for Biden to drop out, is not in a swing district and he is close to former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. \u201cWhile the choice to withdraw from the campaign is President Biden\u2019s alone, I believe it is time for him to pass the torch. And in doing so, secure his legacy of leadership by allowing us to defeat Donald Trump in the upcoming election,\u201d Schiff said in a statement. The California Democrat served as an impeachment manager during one of Trump\u2019s impeachments and has been one of the sharpest critics of the former president. In his statement, Schiff praised Biden\u2019s legacy but added, \u201cour nation is at a crossroads.\u201d \u201cA second Trump presidency will undermine the very foundation of our democracy, and I have serious concerns about whether the President can defeat Donald Trump in November,\u201d he continued. Previously, in the aftermath of Biden\u2019s disastrous performance in the CNN debate last month, Schiff would only go so far as to say the president \u201cshould take a moment to make the best-informed judgment\u201d about the future of his campaign. A Biden campaign official responded to the call from Schiff by pointing to a\u00a0July 8 letter from Biden to congressional Democrats noting his intention to stay in the race, along with his support from Democratic lawmakers, like Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chair Nanette Barragan, among others. The Democratic Party remains roiled about the path forward amid fears that, in light of the debate, Biden cannot defeat Trump and he risks taking down-ballot Democrats with him in November. Earlier Wednesday, CNN reported that the Democratic National Committee\u00a0is\u00a0moving ahead with\u00a0its\u00a0controversial\u00a0plan to virtually nominate Biden ahead of the\u00a0Democratic convention\u00a0in Chicago\u00a0next month\u00a0\u2013 ignoring the growing calls from some of the party\u2019s elected officials to ditch that strategy given the serious ongoing debate about whether the president should continue to seek a second term. This story is breaking and will be updated. CNN\u2019s Owen Dahlkamp, Priscilla Alvarez and Annie Grayer contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/adam-schiff-joe-biden-congress/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_politics_supreme-court-reform-joe-biden-ethics-immunity-term-limits", "text": "President Joe Biden is seriously considering publicly endorsing major reforms at the Supreme Court, a move that would make him the first sitting president in generations to back seismic changes to the way the nation\u2019s highest court operates, according to two sources familiar with the deliberations. Chief among the changes Biden is planning to publicly back are term limits for the nine justices, who currently serve lifetime appointments. The president is also said to be preparing to throw his support behind an ethics code for the court that would contain an enforcement mechanism, which was notably absent from the code the court adopted last year. Liberal lawmakers and groups have been calling for these actions in recent years. Additionally, Biden is considering whether he should push for a constitutional amendment that would effectively reverse the historic ruling from the court earlier this month that gave presidents immunity for some actions they take while in office. The Washington Post first reported the president\u2019s plans to publicly support the reforms. Biden alluded to the fact that he was considering major reforms on a call with members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus over the weekend, a source familiar with the call told CNN. He told lawmakers that while he did not want to get ahead of himself, major reforms were likely coming and that he was in the process of consulting with constitutional lawyers, the source said, adding that Biden did not get into specific details during this meeting. If adopted by Congress, the changes would represent some of the biggest to hit the court in decades. Progressives have in recent years been pushing for such dramatic reforms at the court, but Biden has not fully embraced their proposed reforms, instead taking a much more cautious approach to the court that has included him forming a commission to look at potential reforms during the early days of his presidency. But as the Supreme Court came under intense scrutiny in 2023 following a series of blockbuster investigative pieces that turned a spotlight on the alleged ethical lapses of several of the justices, Democrats in Congress pushed for meaningful reforms at the court, though the issue never fully gained steam. The nine justices eventually released an ethics code in November that did little to assuage concerns from the court\u2019s critics. The reforms backed by Biden would need congressional approval and the constitutional amendment would require ratification by 38 states in a process that seems nearly impossible to succeed. The issue of lifetime appointments was illuminated by the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 2020, who was one of just a few justices this century to die while serving on the bench. Her death gave then-President Donald Trump an opportunity to appoint his third justice to the court, infuriating some Democrats who had wanted the liberal icon to step down during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. The court\u2019s decision earlier this month in Trump\u2019s immunity case also drew negative attention to the court from Democrats. Though the opinion penned by Chief Justice John Roberts technically allows special counsel Jack Smith to inch his election subversion case agains the former president toward resolution, it left many questions unresolved \u2013 making it increasingly unlikely that a trial can get underway before the November election. A concurrence from Justice Clarence Thomas was then used by Judge Aileen Cannon in Florida in order to throw out the mishandling classified documents case against Trump. The Supreme Court has faced dismal approval ratings in recent years, with the public\u2019s view of the court worsening after a series of highly charged rulings \u2013 chief among them is the conservative majority\u2019s 2022 reversal of Roe v. Wade \u2013 and the\u00a0controversies over ethics and transparency\u00a0among some of the justices, including conservative Justices Thomas and Samuel Alito. Biden has cited the Roe decision and others in his reelection bid. Asked about reproductive rights and the Supreme Court in an interview Tuesday with BET News\u2019 Ed Gordon that aired on \u201cCBS Evening News,\u201d Biden warned about what he believes a future Trump presidency would mean in terms of future appointments to the bench. \u201cThere\u2019s probably gonna be two more appointments to the court. There\u2019s probably two people who are going to resign \u2013 uh resign, retire,\u201d Biden said. \u201cJust imagine \u2013 if he has two more appointments on that, what that means forever.\u201d News of Biden\u2019s forthcoming announcement was met with immediate praise from some progressive court reform groups. \u201cReforming this broken court is imperative \u2013 not just for protecting the hard-won rights of the last century, but for making any progress as a nation in the future,\u201d said Sarah Lipton-Lubet, president of the group Take Back the Court. \u201cWhile ethics rules and term limits alone cannot fully restore balance and independence, today\u2019s announcement is a watershed moment in the fight to take back the court.\u201d CNN\u2019s Sam Fossum contributed to this report.
