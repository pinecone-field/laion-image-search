{"id": "2024_05_28_politics_rafah-camp-attack-biden-israel-support", "text": "President Joe Biden is not altering his policy toward Israel following a deadly strike that resulted in the death of more than 45 people, the White House said Tuesday, suggesting the incident had not yet crossed a red line that would force changes in American support. Instead, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the US would look for answers from Israel following the country\u2019s investigation of the incident, which he described as \u201cheartbreaking.\u201d \u201cAs a result of this strike on Sunday, I have no policy changes to speak to. It just happened,\u201d Kirby told reporters at the White House. \u201cThe Israelis are going to investigate it. We\u2019re going to be taking great interest in what they find in that investigation. And we\u2019ll see where it goes from there.\u201d It was the clearest indication yet that Biden has not yet reached the point where he would consider suspending arms shipments or other aid to Israel, despite saying in a CNN interview earlier this month he wouldn\u2019t allow certain US weapons to be used in a major offensive in Rafah. While Kirby called on Israel to take precautions to protect civilian lives and warned there was a danger in Israel becoming more isolated from its traditional allies, he asserted there were no indications yet that it had waged a military campaign that would prompt Biden to withhold aid or weapons. Israeli tanks were seen in central Rafah on Tuesday for the first time in Israel\u2019s seven-month war against Hamas, signaling a new phase of its offensive as Israel presses on despite mounting international pressure. Over the weekend, Israel launched an airstrike on a displacement camp in the southern Gaza city, killing dozens and sparking global outrage. The strike also took out two Hamas leaders, Israel said. Footage obtained by CNN showed the camp in flames, with scores of men, women and children frantically trying to find cover from the nighttime assault. Burned bodies, including those of children, could be seen being pulled by rescuers from the wreckage. \u201cThe word tragic doesn\u2019t even begin to describe it,\u201d Vice President Kamala Harris said of the incident on Tuesday, declining to answer when questioned about whether it crossed a red line. Still, Kirby said Israel\u2019s actions in the southern Gaza city have thus far not amounted to such a major ground operation, defining such a scenario as thousands of troops entering the locale. \u201cShould that occur, then it might make him have to make different decisions in terms of support. We haven\u2019t seen that happen at this point,\u201d Kirby said. Biden has not commented publicly on either development but has been kept appraised of actions inside Israel over the weekend, Kirby said. The US response has stood in sharp contrast to leaders in Europe and elsewhere, who sharply condemned Israel\u2019s actions and called for an end to the violence in Gaza. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was \u201coutraged\u201d by the strikes and called on operations in Rafah to stop. \u201cThere are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cI call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire.\u201d In a news conference on Tuesday, Israel Defense Forces spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said that Israel is looking into the possibility that the Sunday strike may have unintentionally set off possible stored\u00a0weapons\u00a0in a nearby compound and subsequently a large fire that decimated the tented displacement camp. Kirby suggested the US would look to Israel\u2019s assessment of the incident as it gauges a path forward. \u201cWe aren\u2019t on the ground. We aren\u2019t flying the aircraft. We\u2019re not choosing the targets. We\u2019re not providing the intelligence that leads to every target that Israeli society to hit. It is their operation,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir troops involved, their capabilities, their pilots, they have the obligation to investigate this themselves and they\u2019ll do that, and we will take a look and see what it says.\u201d The United\u00a0States \u201cwill be watching\u201d the results of the Israeli investigation into the deadly strike and subsequent fire in\u00a0Rafah\u00a0\u201cclosely,\u201d\u00a0State\u00a0Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Tuesday, saying that the findings should be \u201cpresented openly and transparently to us and to the world.\u201d \u201cAs soon as the United\u00a0States saw reports of this incident, we reached out to the Government of Israel to express our deep concern over what happened, ask for more information and urge them to undertake a full investigation,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/politics/rafah-camp-attack-biden-israel-support/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_biden-pledge-progressives-supreme-court-vacancies", "text": "President\u00a0Joe\u00a0Biden promised Black voters Wednesday that he would appoint progressives to the US Supreme Court if elected to a second term, suggesting he expects vacancies on the high court over the next four years. \u201cThe next president, they\u2019re going to be able to appoint a couple justices, and I\u2019ll be damned \u2014 if in fact we\u2019re able to change some of the justices when they retire and put in really progressive judges like we\u2019ve always had, tell me that won\u2019t change your life,\u201d he said during a campaign rally in Philadelphia. It was as explicit a warning as Biden could offer about the stakes of the upcoming election, and a clear reminder that some of the nine justices have entered their seventies. Clarence Thomas is 75 and Samuel Alito is 74; both are conservative and appointed by Republican\u00a0presidents.\u00a0Sonia Sotomayor,\u00a0a liberal\u00a0who was nominated by President Barack Obama, turns 70 next month. Retirements of any or all of those justices could provide a key opportunity for either Biden, who has named one\u00a0justice\u00a0to the Supreme Court, or his Republican rival Donald Trump, who named three during his four-year term. The ideological makeup of the court has emerged as one of the defining facets of American political power. The current conservative majority \u2014 made possible by Trump\u2019s three appointments \u2014 overturned in 2022 the nationwide right to abortion enshrined in Roe v. Wade, opening a major front in this year\u2019s election. Gun ownership rights, voter protections and regulatory issues have also come before the panel. Justices rarely signal their intentions to retire before announcing them through the court. And presidents have traditionally tread carefully when speaking publicly about the prospect of retirement-age justices stepping down. At the start of his term, Biden made clear to aides there would be no efforts to pressure Justice Stephen Breyer, then age 83, into retirement, even though many Democrats were eager for the political opening such a vacancy would provide. The hands-off approach was rooted in respect for the\u00a0justice,\u00a0whose confirmation Biden oversaw as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and out of fear an overt pressure campaign might backfire. Liberal groups not affiliated with the White House were more explicit in calls for Breyer to retire. Breyer announced his retirement in January 2022, allowing Biden to fulfill a campaign pledge to nominate a Black woman to the court, Ketanji Brown Jackson. Other presidents have adopted a somewhat similar approach. Trump, through his White House counsel Don McGahn, did not make explicit calls for Justice Anthony Kennedy to retire early in his term. Instead, he consulted the\u00a0justice\u00a0on lower court nominations as a way to cultivate a degree of comfort with the process. Obama is said to have danced around the retirement question with Ruth Bader Ginsburg at a lunch in 2013. Then the court\u2019s oldest member, she did not retire during Obama\u2019s term. She died while still on the bench in 2020, and Trump quickly nominated conservative Amy Coney Barrett to replace her. As he attempts a return to the White House, Trump has made his own\u00a0nominees\u00a0to the court a selling point, and promised additional conservative selections if he were to win. \u201cMany presidents never get the opportunity to appoint a Supreme Court justice. I had three. They are gold,\u201d he said at a 2023 speech at the Moms for Liberty summit. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll get three or four more. Can you imagine?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/politics/biden-pledge-progressives-supreme-court-vacancies/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_politics_peter-strzok-lisa-page-fbi-settlement-doj", "text": "Former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page have reached a settlement with the Justice Department after they alleged their privacy rights were violated when their text messages were released and became political fodder for Donald Trump to oppose the Russia investigation during his presidency. The settlement, described as a \u201ctentative agreement\u201d in a court filing on Tuesday, will resolve in full the 5-year-old case Page brought against her former employer. She had sought financial damages of at least $1,000 for alleged privacy violations after her text messages critical of Trump were released to the media. Strzok, who was ultimately fired from the FBI, hasn\u2019t settled the portion of his lawsuit in which he sued for backpay and his job back, the filing said. The settlement has not yet been finalized or approved by a judge. Lawyers for Strzok and Page declined to comment or to provide further detail on the settlement. Strzok in his 2019 lawsuit had accused the Justice Department of wrongfully terminating him because of Trump\u2019s publicly stated anger toward him and the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\u00a0Strzok played a senior role on special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team until he was removed after an internal investigation first revealed his texts with Page, with whom Strzok had an extramarital relationship, that could be read as exhibiting political bias. Page, who had also briefly served on Mueller\u2019s team, resigned from her role as a lawyer for the FBI after the messages were discovered. Page\u2019s suit alleged that \u201cDOJ and/or FBI officials\u201d provided the messages to reporters \u201cfor multiple improper reasons, including to elevate DOJ\u2019s standing with the President.\u201d It claimed that journalists were brought to the Justice Department \u201cto review the messages at night, prohibiting the reporters from copying or removing the set of messages from the building, and instructing them not to reveal DOJ as the source.\u201d Strzok\u2019s lawyers added in a later filing that the defendants \u201cshould not be heard to complain about the notoriety and putative damage to the FBI\u2019s reputation from Strzok\u2019s speech when it was their own illegal disclosures, magnified and distorted by the false attacks made by the President and his allies, that placed a spotlight on Strzok\u2019s opinions.\u201d The suits also led to Trump being deposed last year after a yearslong back and forth, with the Biden Justice Department seeking to shield Trump from giving the testimony, citing legal protections surrounding presidents and their actions while in office. Strzok\u2019s and Page\u2019s attorneys were able to ask Trump at the time about his public statements and other communications he made about the pair in 2017 and 2018. This story has been updated with additional reporting.

{"id": "2024_05_08_politics_young-michigan-voters-biden-israel-gaza", "text": "The nervous Democrat in Jade Gray will get to the worrying part soon enough. But graduating college surrounded by demonstrations and protest was a full circle moment worth cherishing. \u201cIt was in my application letter that this was a campus with a history of protests, a rich history of social justice movements,\u201d Gray said in an interview at the University of Michigan Student Union. \u201cIt was in my application letter,\u201d she repeated with a smile. \u201cI have to be proud that\u2019s the response on campus now. Although the situation is dire, and I\u2019m not remotely happy with what is going on in the world, I am impressed with how people are responding to it. And I think we should feel empowered and inspired by that.\u201d Now to the worrying part. Gray spoke to us alongside fellow new graduate Anushka Jalisatgi. They were co-presidents of the campus College Democrats and they know the pro-Gaza encampment that sprung up on campus for the final weeks of school is a sign of deep political problems for President Joe Biden in a state he likely cannot afford to lose. \u201cAll roads to the White House go through Michigan,\u201d Gray said. \u201cMichigan is up for grabs, and I did not think I would be saying this right now. And I wish I wasn\u2019t saying this right now. But I am genuinely concerned about which way Michigan will go.\u201d Jalisatgi will be back on campus to start law school in September and hopes there is no encampment. \u201cJoe Biden has the ability to make sure that there isn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that starts with calling for a cease fire, for listening to his student voters across the country.\u201d Jalisatgi and Gray are part of a 2024 CNN project designed to experience the presidential campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in battleground states and are members of voting blocs most likely to determine the outcome. Younger voters were critical to Biden returning Michigan to the blue column in 2020; exit polling showed Biden winning 61% of voters aged 18-29, to just 37% for Donald Trump.\u00a0Younger voters also helped Michigan Democrats score big 2022 midterm victories. But our conversations exposed profound troubles with this group for Biden in 2024, even more so than we found in our initial visits\u00a0with these voters back in mid-November. That was just weeks after the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel; the campus activism critical of the Israeli response and Biden\u2019s handling of the crisis was just beginning. Now, that campus activism is a defining chapter for many young voters. Dampened enthusiasm for voting for Biden Summer Matkin, for example, was getting her freshman footing when we first visited her at Wayne State last November. She was home in suburban Detroit when we circled back last week. \u201cIt was stressful,\u201d she said of adjusting to her first year at college. Last fall, she raised giant concerns about the president\u2019s age but did not hesitate when asked who she would pick if the November ballot was a Biden-Trump rematch. \u201cI\u2019d go Biden,\u201d she said in that November interview at Wayne State\u2019s computer gaming lounge. This will be Matkin\u2019s first presidential vote, and she was visibly excited talking about that last fall. Still excited? \u201cQuestionable.\u201d That\u2019s because Matkin has more questions about Biden. \u201cHis age will always play a factor in how I think about him,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter how many Taylor Swift references you make, you will never understand us. But my thing is, I think he has handled everything with Israel and Palestine terribly.\u201d Matkin still leans Biden \u2014 because she cannot stomach the return of Trump to the White House. But she is part of a spirited conversation with friends. \u201cI\u2019ve considered going third party as well,\u201d Matkin said. \u201cA lot of our generation is also considering going third party. But I kind of fear it is going to split up the votes and end up having it fall back on Trump, which I wouldn\u2019t want to happen.\u201d A tepid endorsement There was some progress for Biden in our group. Wayne State student Maya Siegmann was likely Biden when we spoke in November. Certain Biden, she says now. Though her endorsement was hardly overwhelming. \u201cHis age definitely is still a barrier,\u201d Siegmann said in an interview at her suburban Detroit home. \u201cI do still think there should be an age cap on politics in general. \u2026 I would vote Biden. I think that he\u2019s the less bad option for president.\u201d She\u00a0is thrilled with her grades. But Siegmann, who is Jewish, is more thrilled this school year is over \u2014 providing a glimpse into the fear of many Jewish students from the nationwide campus unrest. \u201cIt was terrifying. It was terrifying,\u201d she said of the past semester. \u201cThe escalation on other campuses has made me fear for my campus.\u201d Wayne State was relatively calm. There were modest protests and on a couple of occasions the campus Hillel organization was locked down as a precaution when pro-Palestinian students demonstrated at the student union building where the campus Jewish organization has its offices. Siegmann told us in November she was excited to join a breakdancing club. This visit, she told us she quit because it held a fundraiser for Palestinians and she feared the money would end up going to Hamas. Siegmann said when she asked a club leader questions about the event, he blocked her phone number. It happened again, Siegmman said, when a Jewish student and former Hillel member became highly critical of Israel\u2019s response to the October 7 Hamas attacks. \u201cShe asked for unbiased proof that Hamas is trying to eradicate the Jewish people,\u201d Siegmann said. \u201cI sent her the Hamas charter. And then she blocked me.\u201d Siegmann\u2019s father is Israeli and she is spending the summer in Israel. But her unflinching support of the Jewish state is separate from her views of the Israeli government, especially Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cI personally don\u2019t agree with how he is operating,\u201d she told us. \u201cI think he is trying to prolong the war. \u2026 I think there should be a new prime minister of Israel.\u201d Eyeing third-party options Like Siegmann, Wayne State law student Ibrahim Ghazal speaks with nuance often missing when politicians discuss the conflict and the campus protests. Ghazal is of Palestinian descent and has distant relatives in Gaza. But he is no fan of Hamas and acknowledges Israel\u2019s right to respond to terrorism. \u201cWe don\u2019t want human rights violations,\u201d Ghazal told us during a break in his finals work. \u201cIf you are going to conduct war, conduct it within the rule of law, international law. That\u2019s all people are asking for. Nothing more.\u201d Our November visit was just five weeks after the October 7 Hamas attacks, and already it was clear that Biden\u2019s standing in Michigan\u2019s Arab and Muslim communities was taking a pounding. Ghazal said the president\u2019s predicament is decidedly worse now. \u201cWhat is he going to do to earn our vote?\u201d Ghazal asked. \u201cSending unconditional aid to Israel with a disregard for any of the human rights violations that have been recorded by international agencies continuously, not just denying but preventing independent probes and investigations into possible war crimes that have been committed and reported. \u201cThat\u2019s an issue. If President Biden valued Palestinian lives, valued lives in Gaza, he would definitely allow for independent probes and investigations. If Biden wants to get certain votes, he needs to change course.\u201d Ghazal said he has been too busy with school to find time but plans to research third-party presidential options over the summer. Many friends are likewise looking third party, he said. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s definitely a conversation,\u201d Ghazal said. \u201cNobody wants to vote for Biden.\u201d That sentiment was backed up in Michigan\u2019s Democratic presidential primary. Biden lost to the \u201cuncommitted\u201d option on the ballot in the three Michigan communities with the highest number of voters of Arab descent: Dearborn, Dearborn Heights and Hamtramck. But Ghazal is no fan of Trump and said he understands sitting out or voting third party could help the presumptive GOP nominee in Michigan. But he is prepared to do so if he doesn\u2019t see a major shift from Biden. \u201cThe only reason I haven\u2019t closed the door is because I think he still has an ability to change course,\u201d Ghazal said. Comparing Biden to his GOP opponent New University of Michigan graduates Jalisatgi and Gray promise to be active Biden supporters in the fall even though their College Democrats stint is over and even though they, too, have some reservations about him. Jalisatgi is going home to Missouri for the summer. Gray is already working for a Michigan progressive group. Both hope a break from campus protests and demonstrations will give younger voters time and space to see a bigger picture. \u201cTo me, there isn\u2019t another option,\u201d Gray said. \u201cBecause I\u2019m certainly not voting for the guy who is in court right now and who incited an insurrection and put three extremists on the Supreme Court who took away [abortion] rights for the first time in history. Who\u2019s demonized the LGBTQ community of which I am a part. \u2026 I know there is frustration with Biden, and some of his decisions have been inexcusable, but the reality is we need to vote for him.\u201d At the moment, though, emotions are raw. \u201cHundreds of thousands of people in Gaza and across Palestine have been displaced. Have been starved, have been killed,\u201d Jalisatgi said. \u201cSo, I think it really does come down to people\u2019s own judgments on the motivation of the president.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/politics/young-michigan-voters-biden-israel-gaza/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_04_09_politics_rfk-jr-campaign-official-january-6-trump", "text": "A New York-based campaign official for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. who raised the possibility that voting for the independent presidential candidate would help Donald Trump defeat President Joe Biden previously promoted false claims that the 2020 election was rigged\u00a0and attended \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rallies after the election,\u00a0including\u00a0the rally on January 6, 2021, in Washington, DC, that preceded the deadly riot at the US Capitol. Rita Palma, who has identified herself as the Kennedy campaign\u2019s state director in New York, also\u00a0repeatedly called\u00a0Trump her \u201cfavorite president,\u201d according to tweets along with comments she posted on\u00a0the conservative social media site Parler that have since been made private. According to a KFILE examination of those now-private posts, Palma also posed for a photo at the former Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, alongside Sidney Powell \u2013 the pro-Trump attorney who pleaded guilty in Georgia\u2019s election subversion case. In February 2021,\u00a0Palma tweeted her support\u00a0for Trump as a presidential candidate in 2024 and even asked whether he could run for a third term in 2028 \u2013 which is not constitutionally allowed as a president can serve only two full terms. \u201c#Trump2024 Can he run in 2028 too?\u201d she tweeted, posting a meme that said she would vote for\u00a0Trump in 2024. In one comment, Palma dismissed suggestions from then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that Trump was to blame for violence at the Capitol. \u201cActually the fault lies with the rigged election. Genius,\u201d she\u00a0wrote\u00a0the day after the riot. There is no indication Palma went to the Capitol or was violent on January 6, but tweets from that day show her in DC for Trump\u2019s rally. Palma later dismissed that day\u2019s violence as the work of a few attendees. \u201cJan 6 was not a riot. A small group of people were trouble. It was 99.9 peaceful, respectful. I was there,\u201d\u00a0she wrote. CNN reviewed Palma\u2019s now-private tweets on the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, where\u00a0she included the hashtag #BidenCheated 86 times from November 2020 to February 2021. Palma\u2019s promotion and attendance at \u201cStop the Steal\u201d events after the 2020 election reflects a segment of support Kennedy has received from Trump supporters, particularly as a means of helping the former president retake the White House in 2024. One of the\u00a0biggest donors\u00a0to Kennedy\u2019s super PAC, Timothy Mellon, is also a major donor to Trump. And polls have suggested Kennedy could take critical votes away from Biden. CNN\u00a0was first to report\u00a0that Palma told a gathering of New York state Republicans that efforts to put Kennedy on the ballot in New York would help \u201cget rid of Biden,\u201d which she called her \u201cNo. 1 priority.\u201d \u201cThe only way that Trump can even, remote possibility of taking New York is if Bobby is on the ballot. If it\u2019s Trump vs. Biden, Biden wins. Biden wins six days, seven days a week. With Bobby in the mix, anything can happen,\u201d Palma said in a video of the meeting viewed by CNN. \u201cThe only way for him, for Bobby, to shake it up and to get rid of Biden is if he\u2019s on the ballot in every state, including New York,\u201d she continued. The Kennedy campaign has since distanced itself from Palma. Amaryllis Fox,\u00a0Kennedy\u2019s campaign director, said in a statement posted on X that Palma was hired by the campaign as a ballot-access consultant and that she doesn\u2019t shape electoral strategy, adding that Palma\u2019s remarks in a circulated video were made as a private citizen. Palma did not respond to a CNN request for comment\u00a0but on Tuesday afternoon posted to her Facebook page: \u201cWow- look at that news cycle. I guess the MSM doesn\u2019t like little ole me exercising my 1A rights? Hi, CNN!\u201d Tweets dating to November 2020 show Palma repeatedly volunteering to go to and attending numerous pro-Trump rallies and events \u2013\u00a0even tweeting at\u00a0\u201cStop the Steal\u201d organizer Ali Alexander she would go to Georgia for a week as the state was recounting votes. \u201cWe are rooting for you\u00a0@realDonaldTrump\u00a0Bigly. YUGE rooting. Biggest fan club EVER. #WeLoveYou\u00a0#BestPresidentEver45\u00a0\u00a0#FourMoreYears,\u201d she wrote on November 19, 2020. Palma also\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0expressed\u00a0an affinity for Powell, one of Trump\u2019s election lawyers who\u00a0promoted\u00a0unhinged conspiracy theories\u00a0about nationwide vote-rigging and who filed meritless lawsuits to overturn the results. \u201cYou were born/ chosen for this fight and you will win, win, win. WE LOVE YOU, TOO!\u201d she\u00a0tweeted at\u00a0Powell. In another\u00a0tweet on December 11, 2020,\u00a0Palma called Powell \u201cMY PERSON OF THE DECADE!!\u201d and posted a photo of the pair at the former Trump International Hotel in DC. Last year, Powell\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0in the Georgia election subversion case, in which Trump and a host of co-defendants are accused of orchestrating a broad conspiracy aimed at overturning Biden\u2019s 2020 electoral win in the state. It appears that Palma was in DC to attend the \u201cMillion MAGA March\u201d on December 12, 2020, as she\u00a0posted\u00a0photos on Twitter driving to the rally and posted on the day of the rally. \u201c#MAGAMillionMarch\u00a0 #MAGA #TrumpWon #BidenCheated #46DoesNotExist,\u201d\u00a0she wrote.

{"id": "2024_05_28_politics_trump-family-members-hush-money-trial", "text": "Donald Trump listened to closing arguments on Tuesday surrounded by three of his adult children and some of their spouses \u2013 the largest family gathering in the Manhattan courthouse since the former president\u2019s hush money trial began six weeks ago. However, the display of familial support also drew attention to those conspicuously absent from the family patriarch\u2019s side: his wife and eldest daughter. With a jury verdict potentially days away, Melania Trump and Ivanka Trump have yet to join the former president as he defends himself against 34 charges. Jared Kushner, Ivanka\u2019s husband and a key adviser to Trump during his four years in Washington, hasn\u2019t journeyed to 100 Centre Street for the trial,\u00a0either. Eric Trump, meanwhile, has on several occasions appeared behind his father inside the dingy Manhattan courthouse. Donald Trump Jr., though recovering from knee surgery, has made a few visits as well. On Tuesday, the two were joined by Eric\u2019s wife, Lara, and, for the first time, Trump\u2019s youngest daughter, Tiffany, and her husband, Michael Boulos. During a break in the closing arguments, Trump\u2019s eldest sons attacked the credibility of Michael Cohen, the prosecution\u2019s star witness, and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who brought the case against Trump.\u00a0Trump Jr. also took aim at Robert De Niro, who had spoken outside of the courthouse earlier on Tuesday on behalf of President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign. De Niro, Trump Jr. said, \u201cneeds attention because it\u2019s been a while since he\u2019s cranked out a good movie.\u201d \u201cWe understand that this is a political persecution,\u201d\u00a0he\u00a0said. \u201cThat was evidenced today, today by the Biden campaign themselves holding a rally here.\u201d Who in the Trump family has and has not popped up in New York is illustrative of their approaches to the spotlight generated by his third White House bid. While the Trump children overall are not nearly as involved as they were in his previous campaigns, Eric\u00a0Trump\u00a0has attended campaign events and legal proceedings in another case.\u00a0Trump\u00a0Jr. has made select appearances on the campaign trail and hosts a regular Rumble\u00a0TV\u00a0show where he touts his father\u2019s policies and interviews some of Trump\u2019s staunchest supporters. Lara Trump remains deeply involved in the former president\u2019s political operation and was recently installed as the co-chair of the Republican National Committee after the previous party leader, Ronna McDaniel, lost the confidence of the party\u2019s presumptive nominee. Melania\u00a0Trump,\u00a0though, has not appeared alongside her husband at a single Trump rally and rarely joins him in public. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign did not respond when asked if she intends to accompany him for any of the final days of his trial. Sources familiar with the dynamic said it was unsurprising that the former first lady had not been present nor that she hasn\u2019t commented on the allegations central to the case. Trump is accused of illegally orchestrating payments to silence Stormy Daniels, a porn star who told jurors she had a sexual encounter with the former president a year into his marriage with Melania Trump. The initial reports of this alleged encounter and the subsequent payments published while Trump was in the White House embarrassed\u00a0the then-first lady\u00a0and put stress on their marriage. During the trial, jurors also heard testimony related to another alleged mistress, Playboy centerfold Karen McDougal, who has publicly claimed an eight-month affair with Trump overlapping with Melania\u00a0Trump\u2019s pregnancy with their son Barron. Ivanka Trump\u2019s absence from the Manhattan trial is not surprising to many close to the former president after she and Kushner\u2019s public distancing from Trump\u2019s latest presidential campaign.\u00a0A\u00a0source close to the campaign didn\u2019t rule out the couple making a joint appearance before the verdict.\u00a0Both served as senior advisers during his presidency, but Ivanka\u00a0Trump\u00a0announced she would not be involved in the 2024 campaign, citing a desire to focus on her family. \u201cI love my father very much,\u201d she said. \u201cThis time around, I am choosing to prioritize my young children and the private life we are creating as a family. I do not plan to be involved in politics.\u201d One source in Trump\u2019s orbit noted that Ivanka had specific concerns about her kids\u2019 awareness of the intense limelight from their famous grandfather. \u201cWhen [Ivanka Trump] was at the White House, her\u00a0kids\u00a0were still at the age where they might not know exactly what was going on,\u201d the source said. \u201cHer kids are older now and that\u2019s no longer the case.\u201d Several sources indicated that Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner\u00a0were given a cold shoulder in some social circles after their time in the White House, after facing backlash from friends over her father\u2019s policies and demeanor while in office. After leaving Washington, the couple left New York and moved to Florida. Kushner\u2019s parents, Charles and Seryl Kushner,\u00a0were co-hosts of a New York fundraiser arranged by billionaire Howard Lutnick during the trial. Trump at the end of his presidency pardoned Charles Kushner,\u00a0 a real estate developer who served prison time in the mid-2000s after he pleaded guilty to 16 counts of tax evasion, one count of retaliating against a federal witness \u2013 his brother-in-law \u2013 and another count of lying to the Federal Election Commission. Trump has at times lashed out at the isolation brought on by his court appearances, both privately and publicly complaining early on that his allies had not made their presence felt inside and outside the court room. Republican lawmakers,\u00a0potential vice presidential contenders, donors and allies responded by flocking to the Manhattan courtroom in droves, sparking daily intrigue over who might show up to defend him. Eric Trump became the first family member to attend the trial. He sat behind his father on the ninth day as a witness laid out the paper trail allegedly connecting Trump to a payment to Daniels. On Tuesday, Eric\u00a0Trump\u00a0apologized to the jury while defending his father. \u201cThis has been the greatest colossal waste of time,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_takeaways-trump-jury-deliberations", "text": "The jury in Donald Trump\u2019s New York hush money trial finished its first day of deliberations Wednesday without reaching a verdict after meeting for more than four-and-a-half hours. Jurors will return on Thursday morning at 9:30 a.m. ET to resume deliberations, but the 12 men and women will also again hear from Judge Juan Merchan. Wednesday afternoon, the jury asked to hear a readback of four separate parts of witness testimony, including from former National Enquirer chief David Pecker and Trump\u2019s former fixer Michael Cohen. Jurors also want to re-hear Merchan\u2019s instructions on the law that he had given them earlier Wednesday morning. The jurors requested four pieces of testimony: Pecker\u2019s testimony about his phone conversation with Trump in June 2016, his testimony about not finalizing Trump\u2019s payment to AMI for Karen McDougal\u2019s life rights, his testimony about the August 2015 Trump Tower meeting, and Cohen\u2019s testimony about the Trump Tower meeting. The testimony the jurors are requesting relates to interactions Trump had directly with Pecker. The testimony from Cohen and Pecker about the 2015 meeting concerns the meeting where Pecker agreed to be the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d of the campaign, while Pecker testified in his call with Trump in June 2016 that he discussed the McDougal story and whether Trump should buy it. The jury will ultimately decide whether a former president is convicted of felony crimes for the first time in American history \u2013 at the same time that Trump is running against President Joe Biden for president this November. Judge\u2019s instructions The political implications of the case were not overtly at issue on Wednesday morning as Merchan spent an hour instructing the jury on the law. He explained the 34 felony counts against Trump for falsifying business records over the reimbursement to Cohen for hush money payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election, going over the elements of the crime that jurors must decide prosecutors have proven beyond a reasonable doubt to return a guilty verdict. Merchan also reminded jurors they must put aside their biases as they decide the defendant\u2019s fate. \u201cRemember, you have promised to be a fair juror,\u201d the judge said. \u201cA fair juror is a person who will keep their promise to be fair and impartial and who will not permit the verdict to be influenced by a bias or prejudice in favor of or against a person who appeared in this trial.\u201d Merchan has asked the jury to clarify Thursday morning whether they wanted the entire, hourlong presentation to be read back, or if there were just portions of it that they needed to hear one more time. The jury was not given a written copy of Merchan\u2019s charging instructions, something CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said is a problem. While most federal judges will send the actual document with the jury as it deliberates, New York state courts forbid this practice. \u201cIt\u2019s the way that New York State courts do it,\u201d Honig said. \u201cThey are obstinate, they are stuck in the past, they are making life difficult for the jury.\u201d While the deliberations are ongoing, Trump and his attorneys are remaining in the courthouse in downtown Manhattan, so they can be ready if the jury returns any additional notes, which could be questions or requests like the one Wednesday afternoon to re-hear testimony. The jurors were also given a laptop that had all of the evidence in the trial, so they could consult it while they deliberate. The judge said the laptop does not have internet access. Meanwhile, the six alternate jurors aren\u2019t yet off the hook. They\u2019ve been asked to come back in the event one of them needs to replace one of the 12 jurors in case they are unable to serve.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/politics/takeaways-trump-jury-deliberations/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_politics_biden-trump-campaign-season-analysis", "text": "Labor Day traditionally heralds the final push for presidential campaigns, but a frenetic, compressed calendar this year means the critical marker is the holiday that signals the start of summer rather than the one that marks its end. Monday\u2019s Memorial Day holiday will be a prelude to a bitter season of politics with a neck-and-neck presidential election already looking almost certain to come down to a few thousand votes in a handful of swing states. The heat will be even more intense because the clash between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will for only the second time ever see two presidents each dueling for a second term. The unprecedented nature of the 2024 race will be immediately underscored on Tuesday when Trump returns to the Manhattan courtroom where he is facing his first criminal trial. He is accused of falsifying financial records to cover up a hush money payment to an adult film star before the 2016 election. (He\u2019s pleaded not guilty and denied the alleged affair with the actress.) After a monthlong trial, lawyers for both sides will crystalize their cases in closing summations before the judge hands the jury the historic task of deciding for the first time whether an ex-president and presumptive nominee will be convicted of a crime. It remains unclear how a conviction or an acquittal would reverberate in a polarized nation during a presidential race that has been remarkably stable with neither candidate able to break away. Would the historic stain of a felony conviction for Trump further alienate the critical suburban swing-state voters who may decide the election? Or has Trump been so successful in spreading his narrative that he\u2019s a victim of politically motivated prosecutions that the impact of a guilty verdict would be neutralized? The former president would almost certainly use an acquittal to argue that his other three criminal indictments are baseless. And with those cases unlikely to come to trial before November\u2019s election, a campaign intertwined with Trump\u2019s legal problems would suddenly look more like a traditional election \u2014 albeit one featuring the most unorthodox ex-president of modern times, who tried to overturn democracy after losing the last election to Biden. As soon as the verdict is announced in New York, attention will switch to the unusually early first presidential debate at the end of June on CNN. Biden, who has been consistently a little behind in swing-state polls, has a strong interest in an earlier-than-usual head-to-head confrontation that could change the momentum in the race. The president also wants Americans to tune into Trump\u2019s wild, anti-democratic personality and focus on how extreme a second term that his rival has said he\u2019d devote to retribution would be. While presidential debates have traditionally been in the fall, the growing prevalence of early and mail-in voting is a reason to shift debates earlier. A second presidential debate has been scheduled for September on ABC, and while Trump is pushing for more one-on-one showdowns with Biden, the president\u2019s campaign is resisting his demands. Biden seizes on new abortion controversy to discomfort Trump With the Trump trial on hold ahead of the Memorial Day holiday, Thursday brought a preview of how the rest of the campaign might unfold. Biden argued that a new bill approved by Louisiana lawmakers that would classify abortion-inducing drugs as controlled dangerous substances was a \u201cdirect result of Trump overturning Roe v. Wade.\u201d He was referring to the conservative Supreme Court majority that Trump built that eradicated the nationwide constitutional right to an abortion. \u201cThis is a scary time for women across America. If Donald Trump regains power, he will try to make what is happening in states like Louisiana a reality nationwide,\u201d Biden said. Abortion is one of the few issues where polls show Biden enjoys higher public approval than Trump, and Democrats are counting on it driving up their turnout at a moment when there are serious questions about the durability of Biden\u2019s electoral coalition. The former president has waffled on abortion and his latest position that decisions on the issue should be left to the states does little to protect him politically every time a conservative state or judge takes a hardline anti-abortion position. Another of the key developments to watch this summer will be whether the ex-president is able to maintain what some polls suggest is an unusually strong position for a Republican among minority voters. Biden is taking urgent steps to shore up his support in communities that usually vote overwhelmingly Democrat. He, for instance, issued two new ads on Thursday implicitly accusing Trump of being a racist, recalling the former president\u2019s call for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, a group of minority teenagers falsely accused of beating and raping a woman in New York\u2019s Central Park in the 1980s. The ads also reminded voters about Trump\u2019s racist conspiracy theory about the birthplace of former President Barack Obama. The Trump campaign accused Biden of trying to \u201cgaslight Black voters\u201d and highlighted Biden\u2019s support as a senator for a 1990s crime bill that raised incarceration rates for Black Americans. In what was billed as an attempt to reach out to Black and Hispanic voters, the former president held a rally in the Bronx on Thursday, in a rare visit for a Republican to one of the country\u2019s most Democratic counties. The former president used the opportunity to argue that minorities were suffering because of what he claims is out-of-control migration \u2014 the issue at the core of his campaign. \u201cThese millions and millions of people that are coming into our country, the biggest impact and the biggest negative impact is against our Black population and our Hispanic population, who are losing their jobs, losing their housing, losing everything they can lose,\u201d Trump said. Trump\u2019s event followed a visit by Biden to Morehouse College \u2014 the alma mater of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. \u2013 in Georgia last weekend in which he took implicit aim at Trump and his right-wing supporters, warning that when \u201cold ghosts in new garments seize power, extremists come for the freedoms you thought belonged to you and everyone.\u201d Biden has multiple vulnerabilities Biden also used his Moorehouse speech to try and insulate himself from another of his vulnerabilities heading into the final months of the campaign \u2014 the fury among young and progressive voters about his support for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu amid Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, which has killed tens of thousands of civilians. \u201cThis is one of the hardest, most complicated problems in the world,\u201d Biden said, adding that he was working around the clock for a ceasefire and toward the distant prospect of a Palestinian state. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing easy about it. I know it angers and frustrates many of you, including my family.\u00a0But most of all, I know it breaks your heart.\u00a0It breaks mine as well.\u201d But on Thursday, the president was given a reminder of the backlash against America\u2019s Israel policies with the eruption of another protest like the ones that have rattled college campuses across the country. Demonstrators chanted \u201cdivest now!\u201d as they demanded UCLA pull out of any investments linked to Israel in a largely peaceful protest in Los Angeles. Any large-scale resumption of protests in the run-up to the election, or at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August, could play into Trump\u2019s hands as he claims that law and order is spinning out of control under Biden and would raise further questions about the president\u2019s capacity to achieve strong support from younger and more progressive voters. Biden badly needs the war in Gaza to ease over the summer, but there is no sign that Netanyahu is willing to heed his calls for a lowering of the conflict\u2019s intensity. The president will also be hoping this summer for the cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve that he has long predicted would come and that could give some relief to Americans weary of the cost of homes and vehicles and high prices at supermarkets. The financial crunch has hollowed out Biden\u2019s reputation for economic management despite robust growth and low unemployment and offered Trump an advantage on the issue that decides most US elections. The former president has been creating an idealized vision of the economy during his term, before the Covid-19 pandemic caused a crash. \u201cThe costs have gone up so much,\u201d Trump said in the Bronx. \u201cI don\u2019t eat bacon anymore, it\u2019s too expensive,\u201d the billionaire former real estate tycoon said. Inflation has fallen substantially \u2014 to 3.4% year on year last month \u2014 well below 40-year highs after the pandemic. But many Americans have yet to see the impact in their wallets \u2014 one reason why Trump has an advantage on the perennial election question when voters ask themselves whether they are better off than they were four years ago.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/politics/biden-trump-campaign-season-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_05_28_politics_trump-hush-money-closing-arguments-takeaways", "text": "Prosecutors told jurors on Tuesday they\u2019ve seen a \u201cmountain of evidence\u201d to prove that Donald Trump falsified business records in order to cover up a damaging story about an alleged affair at the end of the 2016 election. Trump\u2019s attorneys told the jury that the prosecution\u2019s criminal case against the former president is wholly reliant on the testimony of Michael Cohen \u2013 the \u201cMVP of liars\u201d who is out to get Trump. Which narrative the jury believes could ultimately decide Trump\u2019s legal fate. The defense and prosecution gave their closing arguments in Trump\u2019s New York hush money trial, spending many hours late into the evening Tuesday offering the jury diametrically opposed stories about the payment made to\u00a0Stormy Daniels in October 2016 and the subsequent reimbursement to Cohen the following year. On Wednesday, Judge Juan Merchan will give the jury his instructions in the morning, and then jurors will begin deliberations, with the historic and unprecedented trial \u2013 and a pivotal moment in the 2024 presidential election \u2013 hanging in the balance. Here are takeaways from Day 21 of the Trump hush money trial: Defense argues jurors cannot convict on Michael Cohen\u2019s words Defense attorney Todd Blanche was up first, and he spent much of his two-hour closing argument attacking the credibility of Cohen, Trump\u2019s former fixer. He accused Cohen of lying directly to the jury, on top of the lies he was convicted of telling. Cohen lied so much, Blanche alleged, that he should be considered the Tom Brady of lying \u2013 the \u201cGLOAT,\u201d or the \u201cGreatest Liar of All Time.\u201d Blanche focused on Cohen\u2019s claims about his phone call with Trump on October 24, 2016. Cohen testified that Trump bodyguard Keith Schiller put Trump on the phone so Cohen could tell him he was going forward with the Daniels payment. During cross-examination, Blanche confronted Cohen with text messages he sent to Schiller around the same time as the call asking for help about a teenager prankster. \u201cWe all know that he called Keith Schiller to talk about the fact that a 14-year-old had been harassing him for several days and forgot to block his number, and Mr. Cohen wanted to fix that,\u201d Blanche said Tuesday. Blanche told the jury it\u2019s clear they were talking about the teen prankster because Cohen hung up and texted Schiller about the situation then followed up the next morning. \u201cThat is perjury,\u201d Blanche said, raising his voice as he slowly emphasized each syllable of the final word. Blanche also said that prosecutors offered no evidence connecting Trump to the payment to Daniels outside of Cohen\u2019s testimony. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that you can find that President Trump knew about this payment at the time it was made without believing the words of Michael Cohen, period. And you cannot \u2013 you cannot \u2013 believe his words,\u201d Blanche told the jury. At the end of his closing argument, Blanche again returned to Cohen. \u201cHis words cannot the trusted,\u201d Blanche said. \u201cHe came in here, he raised his right hand and he lied to each of you repeatedly. You cannot send someone to prison \u2013 you cannot convict somebody based upon the words of Michael Cohen.\u201d Prosecutors objected to Blanche\u2019s commentary about prison \u2013 and Merchan admonished him for saying it, because jurors are not allowed to consider penalties, that\u2019s up to the judge \u2013 but Blanche had made his point regardless. Prosecution defends Cohen but argues there\u2019s more to the case Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass pushed back against Blanche\u2019s attack when it was his turn to present to the jury in the afternoon, arguing there was plenty of corroboration of Cohen\u2019s testimony, both from documents and the testimony of others, particularly former AMI chief David Pecker. \u201cWe didn\u2019t choose Michael Cohen to be our witness. We didn\u2019t pick him up at the witness store. The defendant chose Michael Cohen as his fixer because he was willing to lie and cheat on his behalf,\u201d Steinglass said of Cohen. Steinglass tried to rebut Blanche\u2019s allegation about the October 24, 2016, call with a bit of role-playing. The prosecutor put his thumb and forefinger to the side of his head and acted out a theoretical call Cohen could have made where he talked to both Schiller and Trump. \u201cHey, Keith, how\u2019s it going? It seems like this prankster might be a 14-year-old kid,\u201d Steinglass began the fake conversation, pretending to move into asking Schiller to pass the phone to Trump and then acting out a quick update on Daniels and the payment. When he finished the fake conversation, Steinglass said, \u201c49 seconds.\u201d The call between Schiller and Cohen lasted 1 minute 36 seconds, according to call logs. \u201cThese guys know each other well. They speak in coded language, and they speak fast,\u201d Steinglass said of Cohen and Trump. Steinglass also focused on testimony from Pecker to help bolster Cohen\u2019s credibility, such as showing that Cohen\u2019s story was corroborated by Pecker\u2019s description of a phone call with Trump about the Karen McDougal story in June 2016. \u201cTrump is deputizing Cohen right in front of Pecker so that Pecker knows that any go ahead from Cohen is a go head from Trump. This call makes it impossible for the defense to claim that Cohen was acting on his own here,\u201d Steinglass said, calling it \u201cpowerful evidence of the defendant\u2019s involvement wholly apart from\u202fCohen.\u201d Prosecution walks jurors back through the whole case Steinglass spent 4 hours and 41 minutes walking jurors back through all of the documents and testimony they had heard over the six-week trial, beginning with the 2015 Trump Tower meeting all the way through Trump\u2019s pressure of Cohen in 2018 before Cohen began cooperating with federal investigators and pleaded guilty. \u201cThe name of the game was concealment, and all roads lead inescapably to the man that benefited the most, the defendant, former President Donald J. Trump,\u201d he said. Steinglass argued that Pecker, Trump and Cohen entered into a conspiracy in 2015 when Pecker agreed to be the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d of the campaign \u2013 alleging that the agreement went well beyond the normal bounds of a press relationship. When the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d story came out in October 2016, Steinglass said that Trump and the campaign went into panic mode. Around the time Trump\u2019s campaign was dealing with the fall out of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, he said, Trump was \u201cnegotiating to muzzle a porn star who was prepared to go public with allegations of extramarital sex.\u201d \u201cStormy Daniels was a walking, talking reminder that the defendant was not only words. She would have totally undermined his strategy for spinning away the \u2018Access Hollywood\u2019 tape,\u201d Steinglass said. Steinglass noted that when Cohen paid Daniels\u2019 attorney the $130,000 wire transfer through an LLC, it shouldn\u2019t be surprising to jurors that Trump wasn\u2019t connected to the documents. \u201cNow it\u2019s true that Mr. Trump didn\u2019t sign these documents himself. That\u2019s kind of the whole point,\u201d Steinglass said. Steinglass walked jurors back through the hand-written calculations from former Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg to repay Cohen, in which Weisselberg wrote on Cohen\u2019s bank statement that the reimbursement would be \u201cgrossed up\u201d to account for taxes. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to prove that the defendant made and created the false entries himself,\u201d Steinglass said. Trump is guilty of false business records when he makes or causes a false entry in his business records, Steinglass argued. Steinglass called the handwritten notes from Weisselberg and former Trump Org. controller Jeff McConney \u201cthe smoking guns.\u201d \u201cThey completely blow out of the water the defense claim that the payments\u201d were for \u201clegal services rendered,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m almost speechless that they\u2019re trying to make this argument.\u201d Defense tries to raise \u2018reasonable doubt\u2019 with jury Throughout his presentation, Blanche continued to raise the concept of reasonable doubt with the jury \u2013 even punctuating the conclusion of his closing argument with \u201c10 reasons\u201d why jurors should have reasonable doubt about the case \u201cEach one of these reasons makes a not guilty verdict a very easy path and a very quick path,\u201d Blanche said. Among his arguments: that the invoices and vouchers created to pay Cohen were accurate because Cohen was working as Trump\u2019s attorney, that Trump had no intent to defraud and that there\u2019s no evidence Trump knew the invoices were sent. Blanche also argued there was no attempt to conceal or commit another crime \u2013 one of the conditions needed for a felony conviction \u2013 and there was \u201cabsolutely\u201d no agreement to influence the 2016 election. Blanche argued that AMI would have run former Trump Tower doorman Dino Sajudin\u2019s story about an alleged love child had it been true, that McDougal did not want her story published and that Daniels\u2019 story was already made public in 2011, well before the election. Blanche concluded where he started, arguing that Cohen was the \u201chuman embodiment of reasonable doubt.\u201d \u201cHe lied to you repeatedly. He lied many, many times before you even met him,\u201d Blanche said. \u201cHe is biased and motivated to tell you a story that is not true.\u201d Next up: The case will be in the jury\u2019s hands Now that closing arguments are done, the panel of seven men and five women are expected to begin deliberations Wednesday. Merchan is set to charge the jury Wednesday morning when they return at 10 a.m., giving them instructions on the law. The alternate jurors are expected to be held in the courthouse separate from the main panel that will consider the 34 counts against Trump. Trump and the attorneys for both sides must stay close to the courtroom in case the jury sends a note during deliberations. Reporters, too, will stay in the main and overflow courtrooms on verdict watch. Six weeks into the trial, this will be the first Wednesday that the jury will work as the usual trial schedule left Wednesdays dark for Merchan\u2019s other docket matters.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/politics/trump-hush-money-closing-arguments-takeaways/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_politics_bob-menendez-corruption-trial", "text": "The slow-burning corruption trial of New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez is poised to reach a combustible new phase this week as prosecutors and defense lawyers test the boundaries of the court, the law and the federal judge running the show. US District Court Judge Sidney Stein, whose gentle speaking style belies his firm grip on the proceedings, has increasingly been faced with decisions about what evidence can and cannot be introduced \u2013 or even discussed \u2013 by the prosecution. The defense, too, has at times tested his patience with its questioning of witnesses and tactical objections. Nearly two weeks after a jury was selected and seated in Manhattan federal court, the question of Menendez\u2019s guilt or innocence, and that of his two co-defendants, appears to hinge on how Stein interprets the protections Menendez enjoys as a sitting US senator. Prosecutors have promised clear evidence that the New Jersey Democrat accepted bribes and acted, as stated in the indictment, as an agent for the Egyptian government. Menendez and his co-defendants have pleaded not guilty. But even as the prosecution continues to lay the groundwork in this complex, sprawling case, defense lawyers \u2013 particularly those representing Menendez \u2013 are carefully seeking to zero out anecdotes, documents\u00a0and other details that they say are impermissible in cases of alleged corruption by public officials. Here are four questions expected to dominate the courtroom \u2013 and a congressional race on the other side of the Hudson River \u2013 over the coming week. Can prosecutors thread the (constitutional) needle? Prosecutors from the Southern District of New York are fighting a legal battle on two fronts. On one side, the government is being hit by the US Constitution\u2019s \u201cspeech or debate\u201d clause, a provision designed to shield lawmakers from having their congressional work used against them in a courtroom. On the other, prosecutors are also contending with a more recent precedent, from 2016, when the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in McDonnell v. United States raised the bar for prosecutors trying to prove corruption charges against elected political leaders. This effectively means that some of the most potentially incriminating evidence against Menendez cannot be displayed or spoken of, at least not directly, in front of a jury. Neither side in the case was taken by surprise here. Menendez\u2019s defense is making clear use of both, while prosecutors have argued, broadly and in the back-and-forth over evidence, that their case is so strong as to be invulnerable to these challenges. Menendez is particularly well-drilled in some of these dynamics, having argued in 2017 that his previous corruption trial should be thrown out owing to protections he derived through the speech or debate clause. The Supreme Court rejected that bid, but his lawyers in this case (the previous one ended in a mistrial) are aggressively invoking the precedent to stifle prosecutors. The government\u2019s ability to sketch a clear and convincing picture for the jury despite these growing constraints will likely determine Menendez\u2019s legal fate. Will Menendez take the stand? The odds are long, yes, but it\u2019s not implausible. There is nothing yet to suggest that Menendez or his defense team is planning to make the high-risk, high-reward move \u2013 one that former President Donald Trump, on trial up the street in Manhattan Criminal Court, rejected before moving on to closing arguments. But the possibility is not as remote as many observers might expect \u2013 leaving the potential for another twist in this already sensational case. That potential has more to do with the makeup of the jury than how the case is unfolding in the courtroom. Specifically, it\u2019s the fact that most of the jurors are college-educated, with more than half holding graduate or postgraduate degrees. Their professions reflect as much \u2013 a banker, therapist and artist-turned-business owner among them. Many prosecutors believe \u2013 as a rule of thumb \u2013 that the more formally educated and professionally accomplished the jury, the more inclined it will be to hear directly from a defendant, especially if that person comes to court with a high profile or political power. It\u2019s unclear if this group of prosecutors takes that view \u2013 or, of course, whether the jury would give Menendez credit for taking the oath. What will the jury make of the Blame (Nadine) Game? The defense kicked off its case by pointing the finger at Nadine Menendez, the senator\u2019s wife, who is facing a separate but related trial this summer.\u00a0She has also pleaded not guilty. As the senator\u2019s lawyer told it, Nadine Menendez was keeping secrets \u2013 occasionally in the form of gold bars stored her bedroom closet \u2013 from her husband, while generally taking advantage of his power and cache to enrich the pair. \u201cShe kept things from him,\u201d lawyer Avi Weitzman told the jury. \u201cShe kept him in the dark.\u201d The prosecution, in its opening statement, told a different story. Assistant US Attorney Lara Pomerantz said that the senator used \u201chis wife as a go-between\u201d with his co-defendants and foreign agents. \u201c(She) communicated with the bribe payers, she passed messages to Menendez, and she collected some of the bribes,\u201d Pomerantz said. \u201cAll in exchange for Menendez\u2019s promises to use his power as a senator.\u201d Was Nadine Menendez a bit player who aided her husband in crimes that benefitted them both, as the prosecution insists \u2013 or was she, as the defense argues, something more like a mastermind? The jury\u2019s answer to that question could decide the case. How does it play back home? Weeks before the jury in Lower Manhattan renders their verdict on Menendez, voters in North Jersey\u2019s 8th Congressional District will have a say on his family\u2019s political standing. Menendez himself is not running for reelection in the Democratic primary on June 4, but his son, freshman Rep. Rob Menendez Jr., is on the ballot and facing a serious challenge from Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla. Menendez Jr. was first elected to the seat in 2022 following the retirement of Democrat Albio Sires, who succeeded Bob Menendez in an earlier version of the seat in 2006 when the latter was appointed to the Senate. Though Bhalla has not argued outright that his opponent is corrupt or should be held accountable for his father\u2019s alleged crimes, some of the outside groups supporting him certainly are. \u201cThey say the apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree, so it\u2019s no wonder that Rob Menendez is defending his father\u2019s corruption,\u201d said one TV ad from America\u2019s Promise, a super PAC backing Bhalla. \u201cJersey has enough bad apples. Rob Menendez \u2013 rotten to the core.\u201d Menendez Jr. directly addressed that line of attack in a recent spot of his own. \u201cMy opponent wants to run against my father because he\u2019s scared to run against me. That\u2019s on him,\u201d Menendez Jr. says, speaking straight to camera. \u201cI\u2019m focused on fighting for you.\u201d The recent backlash\u00a0against Garden State Democrats\u2019 uniquely powerful political machine has also played a significant role in the campaign, perhaps even more than the comings and goings of the trial. But for Menendez, the senator and father, the will of the 8th District\u2019s primary voters could weigh heavily on his political future \u2013 and legacy.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/politics/bob-menendez-corruption-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_texas-republican-election-phelan-gonzales", "text": "Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan, the Republican who led last year\u2019s failed effort to impeach and remove from office scandal-plagued state Attorney General Ken Paxton, will win the primary runoff for his legislative seat, CNN projects. As of Wednesday morning, Phelan led David Covey, a former local county GOP chairman, by 366 votes, with nearly all votes counted. Covey, who had the backing of Paxton and former President Donald Trump, has conceded the race for the Beaumont-area district. A host of influential hard-right figures in the Texas GOP came out against Phelan in the primary. The speaker finished second to Covey in the first round of voting in March, though neither took the majority needed to avoid the runoff. Paxton and Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who runs the more conservative state Senate, cast Phelan as a speaker selected by Democrats \u2014 because all members of the House are allowed to vote on who oversees the chamber. \u201cAs lieutenant governor, I do not want to run the House, but I want a conservative Republican to be speaker who will run the House,\u201d Patrick said at the biennial Texas GOP convention earlier this month, The Texas Tribune reported. Phelan was the top target in Paxton\u2019s revenge tour against state House Republicans who voted to impeach him last year. The speaker was among eight state House Republicans who were forced into runoffs \u2014 a list that includes both Paxton targets and those criticized by Gov. Greg Abbott for voting against school vouchers. Among the targets was state Rep. Justin Holland, who is projected to lose the primary runoff for his Dallas-area district to Katrina Pierson, Trump\u2019s national spokesperson during his 2016 presidential campaign. Gonzales narrowly leads in congressional race Meanwhile, in the Republican primary runoff for Texas\u2019 23rd Congressional District, two-term incumbent Tony Gonzales narrowly leads challenger Brandon Herrera by a few hundred votes, though CNN has not made a projection in the contest as of Wednesday morning. The race for the massive border district, which stretches along the US-Mexico border from El Paso to the San Antonio suburbs, had been among the most expensive and bitter GOP primaries so far in 2024, drawing more than $8 million in television advertising spending. Gonzales was the only member of Texas\u2019 congressional delegation forced into a runoff after he failed to take a majority of the vote during the first round in March. First elected\u00a0in 2020 in what was then a battleground district,\u00a0Gonzales\u00a0was censured by the Texas Republican Party last year for a \u201clack of fidelity to Republican principles and priorities.\u201d The party took issue with several House votes cast by the congressman, including for bipartisan gun safety legislation and the Respect for Marriage Act, which protected same-sex and interracial marriage. A key division\u00a0between Gonzales and Herrera came\u00a0over gun policy. The district includes Uvalde, which experienced one of the worst school shootings in US history two years ago that left 19 children and two teachers dead. Gonzales\u2019 vote for the gun safety bill in the aftermath of the tragedy became a centerpiece of Herrera\u2019s campaign, which had the backing of\u00a0several House Republicans, including Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz and Freedom Caucus Chairman Bob Good. The runoff offered a vivid window into the GOP\u2019s intraparty divisions, with hard-right members growing increasingly willing to derail their party\u2019s agenda if there is a whiff of compromise with Democrats. In an interview with CNN last week, Gonzales said the primary runoff\u2019s result would send a clear message to Republicans amid a particularly discordant stretch that has seen their speaker ousted, parts of their agenda stalled and relations roiled across the conference. \u201cAre we going to be the party that governs and gets things done in a conservative manner?\u201d Gonzales said. \u201cOr are we going to be the party that has jesters that come up here and say wild and crazy outrageous things and just try to burn the place down?\u201d The primary winner will next face Democrat Santos Limon, who won his party\u2019s nomination outright in March. The 23rd District is not on Democrats\u2019 target list this fall \u2013 Trump would have carried it under its current lines by 7 points in 2020.

{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_donald-trump-judgment-day-analysis", "text": "Donald Trump, who built a mystique as the brash epitome of power, has never been more powerless to dictate his own fate. His reputation, future, and even perhaps the White House\u2019s destiny, will on Wednesday be placed in the hands of 12 citizens of his native New York City, proving that not even once-and-possibly future commanders in chief are above the law. Seven men and five women jurors will retire for deliberations on Trump\u2019s six-week hush money trial after Judge Juan Merchan instructs them on the law and their duties. No jury in American history has faced such a task \u2014 deciding whether a former president and presumptive major party nominee will be convicted of a crime. And while the jury, which can deliberate for as long as it needs, is bound to decide its verdict on 34 felony charges on the testimony and evidence in the case alone, its decision will reverberate across the nation and the world at a critical moment of the 2024 presidential election. The trial slogged toward its end on Tuesday in nearly 10 hours of closing arguments that burst into open hostility between rival lawyers. \u201cYou have to put aside the distractions, the press, the politics, the noise. Focus on the evidence and the logical inference that can be drawn from that evidence,\u201d prosecution lawyer Joshua Steinglass told the jury. \u201cIn the interest of justice and in the name of the people of the state of the New York, I ask you to find the defendant guilty. Thank you.\u201d Prosecutors accused the ex-president of \u201ca conspiracy and a cover-up\u201d and of betraying 2016 voters by illegally falsifying financial records to hide a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the election. Trump denies having an affair with Daniels and has pleaded not guilty in this first of four looming criminal cases\u00a0\u2014 which may be the only one to go to trial before November\u2019s election. In order to convict Trump, jurors must first decide that he falsified financial documents and did so with the express purpose of committing another crime. The ex-president watched quietly but intently in court Tuesday after days of firing off furious rhetorical assaults on the judge, prosecutors and the legal system. His lead defense counsel, Todd Blanche, tried to eviscerate the credibility of the case\u2019s central witness, Michael Cohen, branding the self-described former Trump \u201cthug\u201d as the \u201cGLOAT\u201d \u2014 \u201cthe Greatest Liar of All Time,\u201d while insisting there was no crime and no proof Trump orchestrated the plan to pay off Daniels. And conjuring a dark image that seemed to capture his client\u2019s cynical view of democracy, Blanche said: \u201cEvery campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win.\u201d The former president, who chose not to testify in his own defense, looked on, often with his arm draped across a chair, in the unusual position of having to leave others to speak for him. Trump has now spent six ignominious weeks breathing the stale air of a foreboding tower block of a courthouse that has dispensed justice to some of New York\u2019s most storied murderers, crooks and Mafia dons. The yellowing white-wash, austere furniture and florescent lights that form the soulless abyss of America\u2019s criminal justice system may have been an insult to the eyes of a developer who frequently boasts about the splendor of his buildings and is more at home under the glistening chandeliers and gold-leafed opulence of his multiple residencies. The final stages of any criminal trial reach a somber register as the gravity of the moment for the accused begins to come into view. In this case, which is entwined with a presidential election that will decide the country\u2019s future, the consequences are even more profound. And there\u2019s also a poignant personal dimension. The city where Trump made his name and reshaped the skyline while romping through the tabloid era of the 1980s is about to judge its estranged son. A political circus erupts outside the court Events outside the courtroom highlighted the rising stakes of the eventual verdict just five months from a currently tight election between Trump and President Joe Biden. Hollywood legend Robert De Niro showed up on behalf of the Biden campaign to blast \u201cthe loser Trump,\u201d accompanied by some of the police officers beaten up by the ex-president\u2019s mob in the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. The star of \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d and \u201cRaging Bull\u201d \u2014 a New York City icon in his own right \u2014 got into a quintessential finger-pointing standoff with a heckling bystander spreading misinformation about the assault on the Capitol. Moments later, Trump\u2019s adult sons, Don Jr. and Eric, showed up for their father, who has come perilously close to incurring a jail spell for repeatedly violating a gag order. \u201cWe understand that this is a political persecution. That was evidenced, today by the Biden campaign themselves holding a rally here,\u201d Don Trump Jr. said. \u201cThey bring in Robert De Niro \u2026 but apparently he needs attention because it\u2019s been a while since he\u2019s cranked out a good movie.\u201d The Biden campaign has tried to keep its distance from Trump\u2019s criminal tribulations, partly to avoid accusations like those from the ex-president\u2019s camp on Tuesday. But its decision to engage as the presumptive GOP nominee\u2019s trial reached a pivotal point began to answer the question of how Biden\u2019s team will react to the end of the trial \u2014 and Trump\u2019s emergence from weeks of the campaign trail being diverted through the courtroom. Despite the circus unfolding outside the court, there is no sign that the trial has gripped the national imagination like previous celebrity cases \u2014 such as the O.J. Simpson saga or the trial of the late King of Pop Michael Jackson. That\u2019s partly to do with the lack of television cameras in Merchan\u2019s courtroom. Some polls have, however, suggested that a guilty verdict could give some Republican voters pause about choosing a convicted felon in November, despite the way Trump weaponized his legal woes as an asset in the GOP primary and his strategy of portraying himself as a persecuted victim in the general election. In a close White House race, only a few thousand defections from the former president could have an outsize effect since the result is likely to be decided in only a handful of swing states by tens of thousands of votes. If Trump is convicted, he\u2019s sure to lash out and redouble his vow to dedicate any second presidency to personal and political \u201cretribution\u201d in a way that could play into Biden\u2019s dominant campaign theme that US democracy is in mortal peril. An acquittal, on the other hand, could validate for Trump\u2019s supporters his claims that all his legal woes are a witch-hunt. The defense rounds yet again on Michael Cohen Trump bitterly complained on Tuesday that the defense got the right to deliver the first summation, meaning that the prosecution argument could be freshest in the jurors\u2019 minds when they come to deliberate. But he didn\u2019t mention that is how the law works in New York state. On one of the most critical days of Trump\u2019s life, Blanche set out about methodically dismantling the prosecution case, seeking to cast reasonable doubt on multiple examples of testimony and evidence. To begin, as Blanche spoke calmly and conversationally, there were none of the often self-defeating histrionics that the ex-president sometimes demands of his lawyers. All Blanche had to do was to cast doubt in the mind of one juror, which could force the judge to declare a mistrial if the jury cannot reach a unanimous verdict. \u201cWe have no burden to prove anything,\u201d Blanche told the jury. \u201cThe burden is always on the government.\u201d Blanche insisted that Cohen did considerable legal work for Trump as his private attorney, countering prosecution arguments that payments made to him once Trump became president were disguised reimbursements for the $130,000 that Cohen paid to Daniels. He told jurors that there was no proof that Trump orchestrated a scheme to subvert the 2016 election or that he even knew what staffers were doing in his name. The attorney returned time and time again to the credibility of Cohen, the most important prosecution witness, portraying him as a serial liar who was caught \u201cred handed\u201d not telling the truth on the stand and who was making millions of dollars on the back of Trump\u2019s legal storm. \u201cYou cannot convict President Trump,\u201d Blanche said, before repeating himself for emphasis while impressing on the jury the gravity of the historic deliberation that lies before them. \u201cYou cannot convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt based on the words of Michael Cohen.\u201d At the end of his summation, Blanche listed 10 reasons why jurors should have reasonable doubt \u2014 including that there was no intent to falsify documents on Trump\u2019s part and no evidence of an orchestrated attempt to meddle in the 2016 election, while arguing that Trump\u2019s intent was to keep stories about Daniels from embarrassing his family. Blanche kept his Trumpiest flourish for his last moments with the jury \u2014 pleading with them not to send the ex-president to prison, in an infringement of legal etiquette and incurring the fury of Merchan. After the jurors returned from a break, the judge warned that their job was to judge the evidence, not to speculate on what punishments Trump might face if he is found guilty. Prosecution expands its case on election interference Steinglass opened his final argument with a long rebuttal of Blanche\u2019s summation, as he sought to show that Cohen\u2019s credibility was not a deal breaker and that in any case the charges were carried by other testimony. Steinglass repeatedly billed the alleged crime not as a seedy attempt to hide a personal transgression but a threat to the integrity of the electoral system. \u201cYou may say, who cares if Mr. Trump slept with a porn star 10 years before the 2016 election? Many people feel that way. It\u2019s harder to say the American people don\u2019t have the right to decide for themselves whether they care or not,\u201d he said. Some observers have suggested that the extraordinary precedent of indicting and trying an ex-president should stem from an alleged offense that threatens the integrity of the republic itself. Trump\u2019s other looming trials \u2014 including over the attempt to subvert the 2020 election and his alleged mishandling of classified documents \u2014 might come closer to reaching this bar. But Steinglass dismissed the notion that the current case is relatively trivial. He said the value of the \u201ccorrupt bargain\u201d involved \u201ccannot be overstated.\u201d He continued: \u201cIt turned out to be one of the most valuable contributions anyone ever made to the Trump campaign,\u201d adding that \u201cthis scheme cooked up by these men at this time could very well be what got President Trump elected.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/politics/donald-trump-judgment-day-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_politics_third-party-president-what-matters", "text": "They booed former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate who currently leads in polling in some swing states. They rejected Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the independent candidate who is polling at 15% in some polls. Instead, at its convention over the weekend, the Libertarian Party selected a little-known former congressional candidate, Chase Oliver, who is hoping they can get to 2% of the popular vote on Election Day. Turns out that Libertarians are motivated by the ultrasmall-government mindset that leads them to be Libertarians as opposed to an uncomfortable alliance to benefit Trump or help Kennedy get on a debate stage. A match with Kennedy made some sense, at least on paper. Libertarians currently have ballot access in 38 states. Kennedy is currently on the ballot in six, although he promises to be on more by Election Day. But the idea of simply placing Kennedy atop the Libertarian Party ticket to marry his momentum with their organization left Kennedy with an embarrassing loss at the Libertarian Party convention in Washington. Kennedy did not even advance out of the first round of voting. Neither did Trump, who could arguably appeal to some Libertarians with his anti-government rhetoric. After his address, Trump was barred from taking part in the nominating process because his campaign failed to fill out the proper paperwork. Where does Kennedy\u2019s support come from? Kennedy\u2019s politics are unique, melding his history as an environmental crusader, his deeply held belief in conspiracy theories and his notable vaccine skepticism. These views are not necessarily very Libertarian. He is at odds with his own running mate, Nicole Shanahan, the ex-wife of a Google co-founder and a top benefactor of the campaign. Kennedy and Shanahan disagree on both abortion policy and Middle East policy. Among those who didn\u2019t vote for Biden or Trump in 2020 \u2013 including both those who supported another candidate and those who didn\u2019t vote at all \u2013 Kennedy got the support of 37% in CNN\u2019s poll conducted by SSRS in April. Trump got the backing of 30% of these voters who either opted for a major party alternative or simply didn\u2019t vote. Biden got just 12%. Kennedy may well take more support from Trump than from Biden, but not by a lot, according to a recent analysis by CNN\u2019s Harry Enten (watch it below). As evidence, Enten pointed to Quinnipiac University polling that asked Kennedy supporters who they would support in a two-way matchup. About half \u2013 51% \u2013 said they would support Trump in a two-way matchup, compared with 37% who said they would pick Biden. In a written analysis, Enten points to polling that suggests many of Kennedy\u2019s current supporters are not yet familiar with many of his most notable positions, including on vaccines. Support for third-party candidates has a tendency to flag closer to Election Day. The recent high-water mark is Ross Perot, who got 19% of the vote in 1992. The last third-party candidate to win a state and get Electoral Votes was George Wallace, who won Southern states in 1968. The only third-party candidate to outperform a major party candidate was former President Teddy Roosevelt, who outpolled Republicans after he failed to get their nomination in 1912 and then ran as a third-party candidate. Woodrow Wilson, a Democrat, won that election. What are Libertarians aiming for? While Kennedy is polling better than recent third-party or independent candidates, most of them barely register. If Oliver can reach 2% in the popular vote, that would be better than the Libertarian candidate Jo Jorgensen in 2020 but still far short of Gary Johnson\u2019s 3.28% of the popular vote in 2016. CNN\u2019s Aaron Pellish was at the Libertarian convention. When I asked him why there was so much opposition to Kennedy and Trump, Pellish sent me these distinct thoughts: First and foremost, Libertarian opposition to Trump and Kennedy starts with fundamental disagreements on policy. Despite both candidates calling for the US to reduce its involvement in foreign conflicts, many Libertarians feel Trump and Kennedy don\u2019t go far enough to prevent wars globally. Many Libertarians also support eliminating the Federal Reserve and oppose the government taxing citizens, extreme measures neither Trump nor Kennedy endorsed in their remarks at the convention.  Several Libertarians I spoke to were frustrated by what they viewed as attempts by both candidates to pander to party members for votes in November.  A few convention attendees linked Kennedy and Trump to Bob Barr, the former GOP congressman who ran as the Libertarian presidential nominee in 2008, and to Bill Weld, the former Republican Massachusetts gov. who ran alongside Gary Johnson as the Libertarian Party\u2019s vice presidential nominee. Both Barr and Weld left the Libertarian Party after losing their respective elections.  But the memory of past politicians who used the party for their own gain without fully committing to Libertarian values appeared to undergird the resentment some Libertarians held for the two interlopers. The inverse comparison is Ron Paul, who ran for president as a Libertarian in the 1980s but found greater success when he ran as a Libertarian-leaning Republican. Paul did not \u2013 and never was going to \u2013 get the Republican nomination, but he made a calculated decision that he could more effectively influence the policy conversation from within a major party. Now Kennedy\u2019s campaign, and the super PAC that supports it, will have to continue the slog of getting on ballots in enough states to make a mark on the election. The Green Party is the only third party that is consistently on the ballot in all 50 states. It will not officially select a nominee until July. Jill Stein, the Green Party nominee in 2012 and 2016, is seen as a likely bet. The best recent election for the Green Party came in 2000, when Ralph Nader won more than 2% of the vote and arguably kept Al Gore, the Democrat, from winning Florida and the presidency. Less than 2% can sway an election The Republican consultant who orchestrated George W. Bush\u2019s campaigns, Karl Rove, notes in The Wall Street Journal that the Green Party candidate in 2016, Stein, got more votes than Trump\u2019s margin of victory in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. He concludes Stein arguably cost the Democratic ticket, led by Hillary Clinton, the election. The same thing may have happened in 2020, Rove argues, when the Libertarian\u2019s Jorgensen got less than 2% of the national vote but exceeded Biden\u2019s margin of victory in Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin. Those stats are true, but Rove\u2019s assessment may be flawed. Johnson, the Libertarian candidate in 2016, outperformed Stein in each of those states Rove mentioned. Trump won anyway. The election reform advocacy group FairVote has compiled data on recent third-party candidates here. But rather than focus on the relatively few people who turn out for a third-party candidate, why not look at the large number of people who don\u2019t take part in elections at all? The 2020 presidential election won by Biden had the highest turnout of any presidential election since 1900. But only about two-thirds \u2013 66% \u2013 of eligible voters turned out to vote, according to an analysis by Pew Research Center, although turnout was higher in some states than others.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/politics/third-party-president-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Prosecutors can ask for a gag order again, Cannon said, once they give \u201csufficient time\u201d to Trump\u2019s defense team to read the motion and discuss it with prosecutors. The special counsel\u2019s request \u2013 the first in the\u00a0classified documents mishandling case\u00a0\u2013 came after Trump repeatedly and misleadingly criticized the FBI for having a policy in place around the use of deadly force during the\u00a0search and seizure of government records at his resort in August 2022. Trump\u2019s campaign, for instance, sent a fundraising email on Tuesday that claimed FBI agents were \u201clocked and loaded\u201d and that he \u201cnearly escaped death\u201d at Mar-a-Lago. While Trump has told his supporters he could have been in danger because of the policy, it is standard protocol for FBI searches and limits how agents may use force in search operations.\u00a0The same standard FBI policy was used in the searches of President Joe Biden\u2019s homes and offices in\u00a0a separate\u00a0classified documents investigation. In a blistering court filing late on Memorial Day, attorneys for Trump said that the gag order request was an \u201cextraordinary, unprecedented, and unconstitutional censorship application\u201d to target Trump\u2019s speech as he runs for president. The attorneys also said that prosecutors, whom they referred to as \u201cself-appointed Thought Police,\u201d were \u201cseeking to condition President Trump\u2019s liberty on his compliance\u201d with their own views. Though many outside legal experts have been critical of Cannon\u2019s approach to the classified documents case in the past, in this instance, Cannon was \u201cright,\u201d said Mark Schnapp, a south Florida defense attorney not involved in the case, who pointed to the court\u2019s local rules for meeting and conferring. Schnapp said it \u201cjust looks bad\u201d for the prosecutors to move forward with filing the motion on a Friday night of a holiday weekend when the defense team had offered to discuss the gag order request on Monday. \u201cWas it going to be a futile exercise? Yes,\u201d said Schnapp. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t\u00a0the kind of thing that they should have filed without following the rules.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/politics/trump-gag-order-cannon-classified-documents/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_louisiana-ten-commandments-classrooms", "text": "Schools in Louisiana could soon be required by law to display the Ten Commandments in every classroom. The state House of Representatives gave final passage to\u00a0House Bill 71\u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0in a 79-16 vote, sending it to Republican Gov. Jeff Landry\u2019s desk. Only Democrats voted against the legislation. If the governor signs it into law, every Louisiana classroom \u2014 from kindergarten through university level \u2014 at schools that receive state funding would be required to display \u201con a poster or framed document that is at least eleven inches by fourteen inches. The text of the Ten Commandments shall be the central focus of the poster or framed document and shall be printed in a large, easily readable font,\u201d according to the text of the bill. HB 71 also specifies the exact language that must be printed on the classroom displays. Republican state Rep. Dodie Horton has said the Ten Commandments are rooted in legal history and her bill would place a \u201cmoral code\u201d in the classroom. She dismissed concerns from Democrats and other opponents that a state requiring a religious text in all classrooms would violate the establishment clause of the US Constitution, which says Congress can \u201cmake no law respecting an establishment of religion.\u201d In defending the bill, supporters leaned on the 2022\u00a0US Supreme Court decision in Kennedy v. Bremerton School District, which gave a high school football coach his job back after he was disciplined over a controversy involving prayer on the field. The Supreme Court ruled that the coach\u2019s prayers amounted to private speech, protected by the First Amendment, and could not be restricted by the school district. The decision lowered the bar between church and state in an opinion that legal experts predicted would allow more religious expression in public spaces.\u00a0At the time, the court clarified that a government entity does not necessarily violate the establishment clause by permitting religious expression in public. If signed into law, legal challenges are expected to quickly follow. CNN has inquired with Landry\u2019s office as to whether he plans to sign. In a joint statement, the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation said they were \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by the legislation. \u201cThis bill is unconstitutional. The state may not require public schools to display the Ten Commandments in classrooms. Many faith-based and civil-rights organizations oppose this measure because it violates students\u2019 and families\u2019 fundamental right to religious freedom,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cWe are closely monitoring this situation and urge Louisianans to let the governor know that he should veto this bill. Politicians should not be forcing religious scripture on students. Our public schools are not Sunday schools, and students of all faiths\u2014or no faith\u2014should feel welcome in them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/politics/louisiana-ten-commandments-classrooms/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_politics_politicians-blaming-wives-what-matters", "text": "Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito doesn\u2019t deny there was an upside-down American flag flying outside his house days before Joe Biden was sworn in as president, an apparent distress signal that would seem to express sympathy with the plight of Donald Trump supporters who refused to believe their guy lost the 2020 election. But Alito did offer an excuse for the flag, which had become a symbol of the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d movement before and after the election. \u201cI had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag,\u201d Alito said in a written statement to The New York Times, which first reported the story. \u201cIt was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor\u2019s use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.\u201d So the wife did it to get back at the neighbors. Her first name is Martha-Ann, by the way. A Supreme Court justice being unmasked as having a partisan tilt wouldn\u2019t be illegal \u2013 just awkward and icky. Alito won\u2019t even have to recuse himself from any cases for possibly showing an electoral preference since there\u2019s no binding code of ethics for Supreme Court justices. He clarified on May 29 in a letter to lawmakers that he would not recuse himself from any cases as a result of the flag controversy. His wife, Alito said, is entitled to her First Amendment rights. \u201cMy wife is fond of flying flags,\u201d\u00a0Alito\u00a0wrote. \u201cI am not.\u201d And the Alito flag incident is small time compared with the direct involvement of Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019 wife Ginni in the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally on January 6, 2021, and her active texting with officials in the White House about how to overturn election results \u2013 something for which Thomas has not offered excuse, apology or recusal. But the \u201cMrs. defense\u201d could be used in much more serious matters than flag flying. Menendez \u2018in the dark\u2019 Take the prosecution of Sen. Bob Menendez, the New Jersey Democrat on trial in New York for federal bribery charges. Menendez\u2019s trial is severed from one of his co-defendants, his wife, Nadine. Both Mr. and Mrs. Menendez deny wrongdoing, but at the outset of his trial this month, it seemed likely that one element of his defense could be to blame his wife. The senator was \u201cin the dark\u201d on money matters, his attorney told jurors. Most of the communication referenced in the indictment is between Nadine Menendez and the New Jersey businessmen who are alleged to have coughed up gold bars and envelopes of cash, along with much more, as they sought Sen. Menendez\u2019s help. Couples behaving badly Former Rep. Duncan Hunter, a California Republican, pioneered the Mrs. defense when he and his wife were both accused of funneling campaign funds for private use. Hunter\u2019s defense was that his wife, Margaret, handled the finances in their personal lives and for his campaign. Both Hunters ultimately pleaded guilty and were later pardoned by Trump. Will it ultimately be a similar story in the prosecution of Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat, who has been charged in a bribery scheme along with his wife, Imelda? The Cuellars present a united front and deny all wrongdoing. Prosecutors allege payments to the couple were laundered through \u201csham consulting contracts\u201d made to \u201cfront companies\u201d owned by Mrs. Cuellar. Couples behaving badly is nothing new in US politics. Former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., an Illinois Democrat, and his wife, Sandra, pleaded guilty to misusing campaign funds to fuel a lavish lifestyle. Variations on the theme Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, were convicted of public corruption in 2014. Their strategy at trial was to portray the former Republican governor as being in the dark about his wife\u2019s activities. A unanimous US Supreme Court, including Alito, later vacated the governor\u2019s conviction and narrowed the scope by which prosecutors can pursue bribery allegations. The Mrs. defense could conceivably be turned on its head and used by a powerful woman to blame her husband. Rep. Cori Bush, a Missouri Democrat, is under investigation for misusing funds to pay her husband for security services. Bush said in a statement that she retained her husband\u2019s security services \u201cbecause he has had extensive experience in this area, and is able to provide the necessary services at or below a fair market rate,\u201d according to CNN\u2019s report. Wives taking the blame, sometimes deservedly, is not a uniquely Washington problem. In April, an Iowa woman named Kim Taylor was sentenced to eight months in prison, according to local reports, for an unsuccessful ballot stuffing scheme to help her husband in a Republican congressional primary. The husband, Jeremy Taylor, was not charged and was later elected to the Woodbury County Board of Supervisors. Alito has strong views about marriage Blaming his wife for flying an inappropriate flag is not the only reason Alito is connected to a wider discussion of the institution of marriage. He continues to complain about the Supreme Court\u2019s 2015 decision that granted the right of marriage to same-sex couples. He grouses that the court\u2019s blessing of same-sex unions means people who think marriage should be between a man and a woman can be labeled by the government as \u201cbigots.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/politics/politicians-blaming-wives-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Coming\u00a0just days after an Israeli strike killed dozens of displaced Palestinians in Rafah,\u00a0Blinken said Israel should\u00a0ask\u00a0itself\u00a0whether \u201cincremental gains\u201d against Hamas \u201cstack up against\u201d the \u201cunintended horrific\u201d consequences of military action. Israel \u201chas to ask whether, and especially in the absence of a plan for the day after in Gaza, further incremental gains against Hamas, but gains that may not be durable, in terms of Hamas\u2019s defeat, in the absence of the plan, how that stacks up against some of the, again unintended, horrific consequences of military action in a place where the people you\u2019re going after are so closely embedded with civilians,\u201d Blinken said during a\u00a0news\u00a0conference in Moldova. Though the Biden administration has been urging Israel to do more to protect civilians in the war against Hamas for months, Blinken\u2019s remarks were some of the most pointed he\u2019s made to date. However, the US has not gone as far as allies like France in condemning the Rafah strike,\u00a0with the White House making clear\u00a0it believes\u00a0Israel\u00a0has not crossed a red line\u00a0that\u00a0would lead the US to withdraw military support. Blinken called the scenes from the weekend \u201chorrific,\u201d reiterating Biden administration calls for Israel to investigate how the\u00a0Rafah\u00a0attack led to so many civilian deaths. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone who has seen the images cannot be deeply affected by just on a basic human level. We have been very clear with Israel and the imperative and this is as in other instances, to immediately investigate and determine exactly what happened and why it happened,\u201d Blinken said. Blinken said he could not say which weapons were used\u00a0in the\u00a0strike, though a\u00a0CNN\u00a0analysis suggests\u00a0US-made munitions were used.\u00a0Israel has said the resulting fire was not caused solely by weapons it used in the strike and that it is trying to determine whether it was set off by a nearby weapons stockpile. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard from the\u00a0Israelis, but again,\u00a0absent\u00a0a completed investigation,\u00a0I can\u2019t verify any of this,\u00a0that small-diameter weapons were used in a targeted fashion to go after specific terrorist leaders of Hamas,\u201d Blinken said. \u201cAgain, I can\u2019t vouch for that at this moment. We have to see what the investigation shows.\u201d Blinken said that\u00a0even\u00a0if\u00a0one\u00a0takes\u00a0what Israel is saying at face value,\u00a0the Rafah attack reveals that even targeted strikes can have awful consequencs. \u201cI think we also see that even limited, focused, targeted attacks, designed to deal with terrorists who killed innocent civilians that are plotting to kill more, even those kinds of operations can have terrible, horrific, unintended consequences,\u201d he said. On Tuesday,\u00a0White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby called on Israel to take precautions to protect civilian lives and warned there was a danger in Israel becoming more isolated from its traditional allies, though he asserted there were no indications yet that it had waged a military campaign that would prompt\u00a0President Joe\u00a0Biden to withhold aid or weapons. \u201cAs a result of this strike on Sunday, I have no policy changes to speak to. It just happened,\u201d Kirby told reporters at the White House. \u201cThe Israelis are going to investigate it. We\u2019re going to be taking great interest in what they find in that investigation.

The suspension begins July 2, according to a signed order from a state judge in Colorado. Ellis has been an attorney licensed to practice law in Colorado for more than a decade, according to court records. Ellis will be unable to practice law for three years in the state. Other states that may recognize her law license are likely to refuse to allow her to practice law as well. This latest action adds to the fallout for others who assisted Trump, such as Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman, who are also losing their abilities to practice law. The Colorado attorney discipline authorities approved the suspension because of Ellis\u2019 admissions in the Georgia case, where others such as Eastman, Giuliani and Trump himself are still fighting the charges. Ellis pleaded guilty last year to one felony count of aiding and abetting false statements\u00a0and will cooperate with Fulton County prosecutors. She was sentenced to five years of probation and ordered to pay $5,000 in restitution. She delivered a tearful statement to the judge while pleading guilty, disavowing her participation in Trump\u2019s unprecedented attempts to overturn the 2020 election. \u201cIf I knew then what I knew now, I would have declined to represent Donald Trump in these post-election challenges. I look back on this experience with deep remorse,\u201d Ellis said. Prior to her guilty plea in Georgia, the same attorney discipline judge that suspended her in Colorado signed off on publicly censuring Ellis for 10 misrepresentations she made following the 2020 election, such as in media appearances where she insisted Trump won \u201cin a landslide.\u201d Last week, Ellis wrote to the Colorado Supreme Court\u00a0disciplinary authorities, in a fulsome mea culpa for her role in spreading Trump\u2019s election lies, according to documents made public related to her attorney discipline proceedings. This letter from Ellis goes even further than the apology she gave in court in Georgia when she pleaded guilty, which focused more on her own remorse and did not describe as thoroughly how she believed Trump\u2019s lies penetrated his campaign and the country after the 2020 election. \u201cI want to tell the truth. In doing so I wish to express my deep remorse and to acknowledge the harm my misconduct caused,\u201d Ellis wrote. In the two-page letter, Ellis said she initially believed election challenges from Trump\u2019s team were being made \u201cin good faith\u201d but was overzealous and took her colleagues\u2019 lies at face value, fueling the public\u2019s belief in false claims about the election. \u201cHad I known what I know now, I would not have been involved,\u201d she wrote. Ellis also said she hoped her public repudiation of Trump\u2019s post-2020 election position will encourage others still denying the election results to change their opinions. \u201cI will gratefully accept a 3-year suspension in my practice of law as consequence for my actions \u2026 I will hopefully encourage others who may still believe that the election was \u2018stolen\u2019 to consider changing their position. Everything that has come out since has not proven that claim,\u201d Ellis wrote. Ellis was also charged in Arizona last month for allegedly conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election results, along with a number of fake electors and several other individuals connected to Trump\u2019s campaign.

Rarely do US jurists, even in retirement, write so\u00a0bluntly. A 1994 appointee of President Bill Clinton and someone whose name appeared on Democratic short-lists for the high court, Tatel particularly criticizes Roberts\u2019\u00a0opinions on race, including to eliminate voting rights protections, a core plank of America\u2019s civil rights revolution. The Supreme Court, Tatel wrote, has\u00a0\u201ckicked precedent to the curb\u201d and become \u201ca tragedy\u201d for civil rights and the rule of law. Tatel also\u00a0reveals\u00a0high-court insights from private conversations with the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. He said she revealed early dealings among justices that eventually led to\u00a0the\u00a0milestone 2013 Shelby County v. Holder\u00a0decision undermining\u00a0the Voting Rights Act. Ginsburg\u00a0also shared with Tatel the pressure she felt to resign\u00a0while a Democrat was still president\u00a0\u2013\u00a0pressure that the judge speculates may have led her to stubbornly stay on the bench. \u201cDuring one dinner at our house, she took me aside to express her annoyance at commentators who were calling for her retirement. \u2018The timing of a resignation is up to each justice,\u2019 she told me. \u2018John Stevens didn\u2019t step down until he was ninety,\u201d\u00a0Tatel wrote. \u201cI sometimes wonder if the public pressure to retire made Ruth even more stubborn,\u201d Tatel continued. \u201cShe was never one to succumb to pressure. She also believed in the American people, and that Hillary Clinton, not Donald Trump, would succeed President Obama. \u2026\u00a0 Even when Trump was elected, I know Ruth still believed she could see his term through.\u201d Ginsburg\u2019s death in 2020 led to Trump\u2019s third appointment, Amy Coney Barrett, which sealed the court majority that overturned the constitutional right to abortion established in the 1973 Roe v. Wade, with the 2022 decision of Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization. \u201c(I)t\u2019s clear as day,\u201d Tatel added, \u201cthat Dobbs never would have happened if Justice Ginsburg had lived, or if she had retired during Obama\u2019s presidency and been replaced by a like-minded justice.\u201d A despairing view of the Supreme Court Tatel\u2019s book, \u201cVision: A Memoir of Blindness and Justice,\u201d covers his expansive legal career and path toward acceptance of his blindness, arising from retinal disease (retinitis pigmentosa) diagnosed when he was in high school. His German shepherd guide dog, Vixen, is featured with Tatel on the book cover. \u201cI\u2019ve made peace with my blindness,\u201d Tatel, now 82, wrote in the book to be published on June 11. \u201cBut I\u2019m concerned about the Supreme Court\u2019s apparent disregard for the principles of judicial restraint that distinguish the unelected judiciary from the two elected branches of government\u2014and about what that might mean for our planet and our democracy.\u201d He\u2019s writing with new frankness and independence.\u00a0As a\u00a0sitting judge, Tatel tempered his criticism of the high court even as his opinions, including on voting rights, were often reversed. Tatel\u2019s\u00a0ideology is rooted in America\u2019s civil rights era of the 1960s and \u201970s. He\u00a0served as director of the Chicago Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and then as director of the National Committee. During the Jimmy Carter administration, he led the Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. He then spent several years at a prominent law firm in Washington, before President Clinton selected him for the DC Circuit, a bench that specializes in important separation-of-powers disputes and regulatory matters. As Tatel\u00a0recounts his legal journey\u00a0and slowly coming to terms with his blindness, his tone is poignant but positive. He turns despairing when he writes of the Supreme Court,\u00a0where\u00a0Roberts has led the current court on a path that shuns racial diversity and remedial measures. \u201cThe way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race,\u201d Roberts wrote in a 2007 case that rejected school integration plans. Tatel\u2019s response in the book:\u00a0\u201cSo much for healing the festering sores of segregation.\u201d Roberts also took the lead to curtail the reach of the Voting Rights Act,\u00a0notably in the 2013 decision that eviscerated\u00a0the law\u2019s\u00a0provision\u00a0that required states with a history of discrimination to clear redistricting or other electoral changes with the US Department of Justice. \u201cOur country has changed,\u201d Roberts wrote in Shelby County v. Holder, \u201cand while any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions.\u201d How the Voting Rights Act was gutted In his book, Tatel wrote that Ginsburg told him about the behind-the-scenes dealings in a 2009 case, known as Northwest Austin v. Holder, that was the forerunner to Shelby County. The 2009 case left the VRA\u2019s Section 5\u00a0intact, although its reasoning\u00a0laid the groundwork for future obliteration. (Tatel had authored the lower court opinions in both Northwest Austin and Shelby County.) When the Supreme Court ruled\u00a0in 2009, Tatel\u00a0said, \u201cWhat I couldn\u2019t figure out was why the four liberal justices had joined the Chief\u2019s majority opinion. \u2026 (T)he unnecessary and irrelevant jabs at Section 5\u2019s constitutionality? Why had they gone along with that part of the Chief \u2019s opinion? I suspected I knew the answer, and Justice Ginsburg herself later confirmed my suspicions.\u201d \u201cThe justices had initially voted 5\u20134 to declare Section 5 unconstitutional, but they later worked out a compromise: The majority agreed to sidestep the big question about Section 5\u2019s constitutionality, and the would-be dissenters agreed \u2026 to sign on to the critique of Section 5,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cWith that compromise, the liberal justices had bought Congress time to salvage the keystone of the Civil Rights Movement.\u201d Congress never acted, and Tatel contends the 2009 compromise cost the liberals: \u201cThey sure paid a high price: an unrebutted opinion that criticized the VRA and, worse, endorsed a new \u2018equal sovereignty\u2019 doctrine with potentially profound\u00a0implications,\u201d Tatel wrote of the principle that restricted Congress\u2019 ability to single out certain states, in this situation because of past discriminatory practices. \u201cThe\u00a0Court\u2019s opinion in Northwest Austin thus planted the seeds for Section 5\u2019s destruction.\u201d Tatel said Ginsburg often reached out to him regarding his DC Circuit cases that came before the Supreme Court on appeal. \u201cOne particularly memorable case involved an energy task force headed by Vice President Dick Cheney,\u201d he recounted of a 2004 dispute. \u201c\u2026 I wrote an opinion that the Supreme Court reversed 7\u20132. (It would have been 6\u20132, but Justice Scalia had refused to recuse himself notwithstanding his recent duck-hunting trip with Vice President Cheney.) Just minutes after the Court announced its decision, my chambers\u2019 fax machine sputtered to life with a message from Justice Ginsburg. \u2018Dear David: This is the dissenting statement I just read from the bench. Every best wish, Ruth.\u2019\u201d As Tatel observed, justices read excerpts of their dissents from the bench only when they feel especially strongly about a case. Tatel added that he was reluctant to announce his retirement in 2021 after President Joe Biden, a Democrat, came to office. But he decided against waiting another four years, on the chance his successor would be named by a president who campaigned on the court and essentially against the rule of law. \u201cFrankly,\u201d Tatel wrote, \u201cI was also tired of having my work reviewed by a Supreme Court that seemed to hold in such low regard the principles to which I\u2019ve dedicated my life.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/politics/david-tatel-john-roberts-supreme-court-ruth-bader-ginsburg/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Harrison Floyd, who led the organization Black Voices for Trump in 2020, argued during a hearing Tuesday that he should not have been charged in the racketeering case because his concerns about voter fraud and questions about the election results were legitimate. Trump lost to President Joe Biden in Georgia by more than 12,000 votes. Floyd\u2019s attorneys are pushing to access more than 500,000 ballots from Fulton County, claiming they intend to produce \u201cevidence\u201d that thousands of votes were improperly excluded from the final vote tally. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee asked Floyd\u2019s attorneys on Tuesday to file additional information to the court in the coming weeks, including the scope of the expert review of the 2020 votes that they\u2019re seeking. McAfee also said he plans to have another hearing within the next two months to discuss the next steps in Floyd\u2019s attempt to access the ballots. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, found no evidence of fraud in the 2020 election after overseeing three separate counts of the ballots, conducting many other reviews of the process, and investigating more than 250 claims of voter fraud. Floyd is one of 15 remaining defendants, including Trump, facing charges related to efforts by the former president and his allies to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in Georgia. A Maryland resident, Floyd has been charged with three counts in Georgia, including racketeering, conspiracy to commit solicitation of false statements and writings, and influencing witnesses. Chad Alexis, senior assistant attorney for Fulton County, pushed back on 2020 voter-fraud arguments from Floyd\u2019s attorneys. Alexis also said the process of producing the ballots would take \u201cthousands of hours\u201d and that this is a busy presidential election year during which the county needs \u201call hands-on deck.\u201d \u201cThe county shouldn\u2019t have to bear the burden of manpower,\u201d Alexis argued. The Fulton County racketeering case against Trump has effectively been at a standstill. A Georgia appeals court is revisiting the question of whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and her office should be removed from prosecuting the case because of her romantic relationship with her former lead prosecutor Nathan Wade. And a legal argument before the Supreme Court over whether Trump has immunity from prosecution also remains an issue in the Georgia case.

The call was placed by the husband of a neighbor who exchanged words with Alito\u2019s wife, Martha-Ann Alito, after the neighbor put up yard signs critical of Republicans.

{"id": "2024_05_28_politics_trump-closing-arguments-trial-analysis", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s first criminal trial has arrived at its dramatic final act with lawyers for both sides primed on Tuesday to hammer home their cases before jurors consider a verdict that could make history. The summations mark the climax of a trial that started more than a month ago. They are expected to last all day Tuesday and could stretch into the following day. After Judge Juan Merchan instructs jurors on the law, Trump and the rest of the country will be held in suspense to see whether he will become the first ex-president and presumptive GOP nominee to be convicted of a crime after allegedly falsifying financial records to hide a hush money payment to an adult film star in 2016. The verdict will reverberate far beyond the courtroom and Trump\u2019s personal life since the case has become intertwined with his bid to reclaim the White House. The stakes are especially high since this is likely to be the only one of four pending criminal trials expected to go to a jury before November\u2019s election. The former president appeared to be in a bitter mood on the eve of his return to the courtroom, lashing out at opponents he called \u201cHuman Scum\u201d in a message on social media marking Memorial Day. Trump\u2019s defense team is trying to spare their client the ignominy of a conviction that would stain his reputation. The ex-president\u2019s lead lawyer, Todd Blanche, is expected to zero in on the credibility of Trump\u2019s former fixer-turned-nemesis, Michael Cohen, who endured a bruising cross-examination, and to ask why other key figures in the ex-president\u2019s business and personal orbit were not called by prosecutors, CNN\u2019s Kara Scannell reported. Joshua Steinglass, who is conducting closing arguments for the prosecution, will follow Blanche and is expected to spend several hours taking the jury through text messages, phone logs, other witnesses\u2019 testimony and the 34 allegedly falsified documents to corroborate Cohen\u2019s testimony. Ultimately, the team working for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, will try to convince seven men and five women jurors that Trump orchestrated a scheme to keep unflattering information from voters in what was an early example of election interference. Trump has denied having an affair with Stormy Daniels and has pleaded not guilty. His lawyers do not have to convince all of the jury that he is innocent \u2014 they need only one juror to stand firm against the unanimous guilty verdict required to convict. Their conduct of the trial, in which they produced only two witnesses in a brief defense, signals they will argue that the state of New York has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the ex-president ordered and carried out a scheme, which, in any case, they say doesn\u2019t amount to breaking the law. They argued during the trial that there was no evidence of criminal intent. And they will seek to leave jurors with a devastating final picture of Cohen, who admitted on the stand that he was a liar and was benefiting financially from a growing media empire targeting his ex-boss. While there is a big difference with a hung jury that could force the judge to declare a mistrial, leaving an opening for prosecutors to try Trump again, any outcome that doesn\u2019t end in a conviction could serve Trump\u2019s political purposes, at least for now. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the voting public sees much of a difference between the two. For many, including the defendant, the only relevant question is whether he is a convicted felon or not,\u201d said CNN legal analyst Elliot Williams. \u201cSo, I\u2019d assume the defense is really just hoping to plant a seed in the head of that one juror who has enough doubts about the\u00a0case and might be stubborn enough not to back down.\u201d Cohen will be at the center of the drama again Blanche argued earlier in the month that Cohen was so conflicted as a witness that the case should not even go to the jury. He told the judge: \u201cHe testified. And he lied under oath. In this courtroom. And the consequences of that lie, if accepted by the jury, is a conviction, potentially.\u201d Closing arguments are the stage in a case where lawyers summarize weeks of complex testimony and courtroom theatrics and sketch a narrative designed to shape the deliberations over evidence in the jury room. They are also used to impress upon jurors the huge stakes of a trial \u2014 both the grave reality that a person\u2019s reputation and even liberty is on the line and the importance of upholding the rule of law. The jury in this case must work through a complex legal equation at the heart of the case. To reach a guilty verdict, they must agree that New York state prosecutors have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump falsified business records \u2014 which is normally a misdemeanor in the state. Then, to convict Trump of a felony, the jury must determine that this was done to commit another crime \u2014 in this case in relation to the 2016 election. The prosecution is likely to argue that while the defense roughed up Cohen, he was truthful about the key elements of the case, and that his testimony was corroborated in advance by weeks of evidence. Former Manhattan prosecutor Jeremy Saland told \u201cCNN This Morning\u201d on Sunday that it was not important how jurors generally viewed Cohen as a person. \u201cWhether you like Michael Cohen, whether you\u2019d want him to date your sister, whether you\u2019d want (him) to be your brother-in-law \u2026 you don\u2019t have to like the guy. This is not a likability contest. (Was he) truthful in that moment in time? Was he honest and credible?\u201d In days of evidence, the prosecution built a brick-by-brick legal edifice to pre-but the attacks on Cohen\u2019s credibility, which everyone knew were coming since the man who described himself as Trump\u2019s former \u201cthug\u201d went to jail for offenses including lying to Congress. \u201cThere were weeks and weeks of testimony from witnesses who testified and whose testimony was corroborated by emails, bank records, contemporaneous phone calls, text messages, and other documents of a conspiracy,\u201d\u00a0prosecutor Matthew Colangelo argued in court. That evidence was intended to create a storyline that highlighted Trump\u2019s alleged affair with Daniels, in explicit detail, in order to explain to jurors why he might have wanted to cover it up. They secured testimony from former tabloid publisher David Pecker to highlight Trump\u2019s history of shutting down embarrassing stories, and they produced evidence from former Trump associates, including ex-White House communications director Hope Hicks, to counter the idea Trump was simply seeking to hide his embarrassment about Daniels from his family and was instead most worried about voters forming an unfavorable impression of him in 2016. Prosecutors also sketched a paper trail to suggest that Cohen was acting on the ex-president\u2019s orders in making a $130,000 payment to Daniels and that Trump was involved in cooking the financial books while serving as president to disguise a reimbursement to his former fixer. Another test of Trump\u2019s brittle self-control Tuesday\u2019s closing arguments will create another personal test for Trump, whose attacks on witnesses previously caused Merchan to warn he could be jailed over further violations of a partial gag order. While staying just inside Merchan\u2019s red line, Trump has continued to fire off daily rhetorical attacks on the judge, prosecutors and the Justice Department, along with false claims that the trial is part of an overarching conspiracy by President Joe Biden to destroy him before Election Day. Trump has raised doubts that the 12 New Yorkers who will judge him in the city where he made his name will give him a fair trial. And he has been aided by a parade of Republican supporters, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, who showed up to bolster Trump\u2019s assault on the justice system. Trump\u2019s belligerence would be incredible coming from any defendant, let alone one seeking to reassume his role as titular head and ultimate defender of the Constitution as the 47th president. Just over five months from the election, it\u2019s unclear if or how public opinion that is already polarized around Trump will shift when the verdict is announced. The trial has not gripped the attention of the country as it might have were television cameras allowed in the courtroom. And Trump used his multiple criminal indictments to his political advantage in clearing the Republican nominating field. But some polls suggest a conviction could weigh against him in a tight election with Biden. Past behavior also suggests Trump would use any acquittal or a mistrial caused by a hung jury to claim vindication in all his criminal cases and to fuel the campaign of personal and political vengeance around which he\u2019s promised to build a second presidency. The final arguments will go ahead following an unusual weeklong break in the trial that occurred since Merchan wanted to avoid final arguments and jury instruction being interrupted by the Memorial Day holiday. The time off only seems to have escalated Trump\u2019s fury as one of the defining weeks of his life dawns. \u201cHappy Memorial Day to All, including the Human Scum that is working so hard to destroy our Once Great Country,\u201d Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social network that was especially jarring on a day dedicated to fallen members of the military. Trump fulminated against judges who had presided over a massive fraud judgment against him, his firm and his adult sons that was worth nearly half a billion dollars and a defamation suit in which he was ordered to pay the writer E. Jean Carroll $83.3 million. Trump concluded his tirade with the words: \u201cNow for Merchan!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/politics/trump-closing-arguments-trial-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The Chinese man, YunHe Wang, is accused of helping assemble a vast network of infected computers, known as a botnet, that was used to carry out bomb threats, send child exploitation materials online and conduct financial fraud, among other schemes,\u00a0the department\u00a0alleges. Fraudsters used the botnet to submit tens of thousands of fake applications for federal relief\u00a0during\u00a0the coronavirus pandemic, leading to losses of about $5.9 billion,\u00a0according to statements from the Departments of Justice and Treasury. The alleged cybercriminal conduct and the lavish lifestyle it funded \u201creads like it\u2019s ripped from a screenplay,\u201d Matthew Axelrod, a senior US Commerce Department official involved in the investigation, said in a statement. Law enforcement agents seized about $4 million worth of watches, sports cars and other luxury assets, including a Ferrari and Rolls-Royce, and $30 million in real estate properties across East Asia, the Middle East, the Caribbean and the US, Brett Leatherman, a senior FBI official, told reporters.\u00a0Wang used money he earned from renting the botnet to buy property in those locations, according to an indictment unsealed in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. Authorities in Singapore and Thailand worked with the FBI on the bust, the Justice Department said. Court records did not list an attorney for Wang. Leatherman said the US government was pursuing his extradition to the US and that an investigation into other potential suspects was ongoing. Wang and other alleged members of the criminal network used virtual private networking (VPN) to spread their malicious code, infecting 19 million different IP addresses worldwide, including over 600,000 in the US, according to prosecutors. IP addresses are the unique numbers that correspond to individual devices on the internet.

Fraudsters pounced\u00a0on opportunities to exploit\u00a0the more than $2 trillion federal economic stimulus package known as the CARES Act, a 2020 law that the botnet allegedly\u00a0targeted. The problem got so bad that the Secret Service\u00a0named\u00a0a senior official as National Pandemic Fraud Recovery Coordinator to try to claw back some of the many billions that were stolen.

{"id": "2024_05_14_politics_fact-check-biden-inflation-when-he-became-president", "text": "For the second time in less than a week, President Joe Biden falsely claimed Tuesday that the inflation rate was 9% when he began his presidency. Biden was criticized by many Republicans, including former president and current presidential rival Donald Trump, for telling CNN in an interview last Wednesday: \u201cNo president\u2019s had the run we\u2019ve had in terms of creating jobs and bringing down inflation.\u00a0It was 9% percent when I came to office, 9%.\u201d Biden repeated the claim about the inflation rate, albeit in slightly vaguer form, in a Tuesday interview with Yahoo Finance. This time, he said: \u201cI think inflation has gone slightly up. It was at 9% when I came in, and it\u2019s now down around 3%.\u201d Facts First: Biden\u2019s claim that the inflation rate was 9% when he became president is not close to true. The year-over-year inflation rate in January 2021, the month of his inauguration, was about 1.4%. The Biden-era inflation rate did peak at about 9.1% \u2013 but that peak occurred in June 2022, after Biden had been president for more than 16 months. The March 2024 inflation rate, the most recent available rate at the time Biden made these comments, was about 3.5%, up from about 3.2% the month prior. In other words, Biden\u2019s claims make it sound like inflation is much lower today than it was when he was inaugurated \u2013 but it is actually higher, though there has been a steep decline since the June 2022 peak. (That peak followed Russia\u2019s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which sparked global increases in energy and food prices.) And while Biden\u2019s claims make it sound like the end of the Trump presidency was plagued by high inflation, inflation was unusually low during Trump\u2019s last months in the White House amid the economic slowdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Similar to a previous false claim Biden\u2019s false claims in the past week about overall inflation are similar to a false claim he made in October 2022 when talking about gas prices in particular. In both cases, he has wrongly depicted a figure from June 2022 as if it was the Biden-era starting point. A White House official said in a Tuesday email to CNN: \u201cThe President was making the point that the factors that caused inflation were in place when he took office.\u00a0The pandemic caused inflation around the world by disrupting our economy and breaking our supply chains.\u201d The April 2024 inflation rate will be revealed Wednesday with the release of new Consumer Price Index data. Separate Producer Price Index data that was released on Tuesday showed the highest wholesale inflation rate in a year. This story has been updated with comment from the White House.

{"id": "2024_04_10_politics_lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims", "text": "The Republican National Committee last week sent out a scripted call to voters\u2019 phones on behalf of new co-chair Lara Trump saying Democrats committed \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election. It\u2019s the latest example of how the RNC under the former president\u2019s daughter-in-law is perpetuating lies about the 2020 election, even as prominent Republicans say the party needs to look forward to win in 2024. \u201cWe all know the problems. No photo IDs, unsecured ballot drop boxes, mass mailing of ballots, and voter rolls chock full of deceased people and non-citizens are just a few examples of the massive fraud that took place,\u201d the RNC call said. \u201cIf Democrats have their way, your vote could be canceled out by someone who isn\u2019t even an American citizen.\u201d The claim of \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election marks a significant shift in messaging for the RNC because lies about the 2020 election had not been a consistent theme in its messaging since Donald Trump left office. But the call\u2019s message is largely consistent with the views publicly espoused over the past four years by Lara Trump, who was elected as co-chair in early March as part of Donald Trump\u2019s takeover of the GOP. Lara Trump has a long history of echoing his election fraud claims, according to a CNN KFile analysis of her past statements as a commentator and surrogate for the former president. \u201cI\u2019m sure you agree with co-chair Trump that we cannot allow the chaos and questions of the 2020 election to ever happen again,\u201d said the call, which was obtained by CNN\u2019s KFile from the anti-robocall application Nomorobo, which estimated 145,000 calls were sent with the message from April 1-7. It comes amid previous CNN reporting about the RNC asking employees who are reapplying for their jobs whether they believe the 2020 election was stolen in an apparent litmus test for hiring. The RNC denied any such litmus test existed.\u00a0Lara Trump and new chair Michael Whatley succeeded Drew McKissick and Ronna McDaniel, who had earned the ire of the former president because of his dissatisfaction with how the RNC handled claims of fraud around the 2020 election, CNN previously reported. There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, as even some state GOP election officials and former Trump Attorney General William Barr have acknowledged. The former president and his supporters filed more than 60 court cases in six key battleground states following the election and lost every one of them. And, they have still not brought forth any evidence of the rampant cheating they continue to talk about on the campaign trail. But in the years since the 2020 election, Lara Trump has continued to push claims of fraud. Her comments have been in line with those of her father-in-law, who\u2019s successfully reshaped the GOP in his image and easily secured his third-straight GOP nomination this year. Polling, for example, shows that a majority of GOP voters think the 2020 election result was illegitimate. A CNN poll released last September found that 71% of Republicans said President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cdid not legitimately win enough votes to win the presidency.\u201d From November 2020 to February 2024, Lara Trump propagated the narrative of Democratic cheating in the 2020 presidential election. And even after she was elected co-chair and said claims of a stolen election are \u201cin the past,\u201d she didn\u2019t repudiate those baseless accusations. \u201cWell, I think we\u2019re past that. I think that\u2019s in the past. We learned a lot. Certainly, we took a lot of notes,\u201d Trump said in an NBC interview when asked whether claims of a stolen 2020 election would be the official position of the RNC in 2024. She went on to tout lawsuits across 23 states \u201cto ensure that it is harder to cheat and easier to vote,\u201d while raising questions about pandemic-era voting procedures during the 2020 election. In the same interview, Trump also added the GOP needed to \u201ctrust mail-in voting.\u201d Neither the RNC nor Lara Trump responded to multiple requests for comment. A long history of spreading election lies As recently as February 2024, Lara Trump said she did not believe Biden received 81 million votes in the 2020 election. \u201cDoes anyone actually believe that in 2020, 81 million people were so inspired by a guy who could only get 10 people (to attended events) \u2026that he had the most massive turnout in the history of elections?\u201d she said at a Trump event in South Carolina just days before she announced her campaign for RNC co-chair. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t believe that.\u201d On her internet show and podcast, and in public events, she often spread outlandish and nonsensical claims about the 2020 election. On an episode of her show that aired on December 30, 2020, Trump agreed with her co-hosts that the election did not pass the \u201csmell test\u201d and falsely suggested that dead voters helped Biden win. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know if this is true, but somebody sent me this. Donald Trump got 74 million votes. There are 133 million registered voters in the United States. If every single registered voter went out and voted, which we know is basically impossible, doesn\u2019t happen, there would only be 59 million votes left for Joe Biden. So how the heck did he get 81 million votes?\u201d she said. The comments cite a widely debunked analysis that misrepresents the number of people eligible to vote. \u201cYou\u2019re discriminating against all the dead people, Lara. How dare you!\u201d said one co-host. \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s true,\u201d she responded. A CNN analysis previously found no evidence to support this claim, debunking the misinformation spread by Trump supporters online in the aftermath of the 2020 results. The 2020 election saw a record-breaking turnout, with 155 million people casting their votes, as reported by the US Census Bureau. This marked the highest voter participation of the 21st century, with 66.8% of eligible citizens aged 18 and older voting. Later in the episode, Trump said, \u201cI think that [Democrats] know that the Republicans are not gonna let it stand. They\u2019re not gonna certify votes for Joe Biden. And it is likely that they will be voting for Donald Trump for a second term.\u201d In an episode of her podcast weeks earlier, she claimed the odds of Biden winning in swing states were \u201cone in one quadrillion to the fourth power,\u201d as mail-in ballots were counted, failing to cite a statistical analysis. Though Biden narrowly lost with in-person voters, 46% of voters voted by mail in 2020. As votes were counted, Biden pulled ahead, according to an analysis from Pew Research. Though nothing was abnormal or illegal about the process, Lara Trump has also referred to the counting of votes nefariously. \u201cWe gotta make up so much for all the cheating,\u201d Trump said on her podcast in September 2023. \u201cWe know the Democrats love to do that. We need to go into this thing with such a big lead that they\u2019re like, \u2018oh my God, we can\u2019t do a 3:00 a.m. spike with this. We\u2019re never gonna make it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/politics/lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_biden-philadelphia-black-voters", "text": "President Joe Biden launched a nationwide effort to mobilize Black voters during a campaign rally in Philadelphia on Wednesday, aiming to win back support from a slice of the electorate that polls show wavering in support. Joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and a slate of Black elected officials, Biden boosted his achievements while also warning of what his campaign calls a \u201cracist and toxic agenda\u201d being peddled by his rival, former President Donald Trump. He warned the threats posed by a second Trump term would be graver than the first time around, and said his rival was running a campaign of vengeance after losing in 2020. \u201cHe\u2019s running again and he\u2019s clearly unhinged. He called insurrectionists patriots quote patriots,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIf reelected, he wants to pardon every one of them. Let me ask you - what do you think he would\u2019ve done on January 6 if Black Americans had stormed? Think about it - if Black Americans had stormed the Capitol? Don\u2019t think he\u2019d be talking about pardons.\u201d The launch of Black Voters for Biden-Harris, held at a majority-Black prep school in Philadelphia, was intended to revive another corner of the coalition that helped propel Biden to the White House in 2020. It\u2019s his third stop for an event in the city this year; he held seven events in Philadelphia in 2023. Biden didn\u2019t mince his words in describing Trump\u2019s record, saying he \u201cis the same guy who wanted to tear gas you as you peacefully protested George Floyd\u2019s murder. The same guy who still calls the Central Park five guilty, even though they\u2019re exonerated.\u201d Biden\u2019s aides say they aren\u2019t taking Black voters for granted as surveys suggest an erosion of support, particularly among Black men. \u201cListen, we know right now that we\u2019re operating in an incredibly fractured and fragmented media environment, you still have a lot of young voters in particular who have not yet tuned in to the presidential election,\u201d communications director Michael Tyler told CNN ahead of Biden\u2019s speech. \u201cAnd so, that\u2019s why this campaign is relentlessly focused on reaching voters where they are right now, not waiting until September or October as some campaigns have done in the past \u2013 to reach out to\u00a0Black\u00a0voters, young\u00a0Black\u00a0voters in particular, but using every tool at our disposal right now to do so.\u201d Still, the results of those efforts have proven elusive. Many polls have found Black voters more disconnected from the Democratic Party than they have been in decades. A\u00a0New York Times/Siena College survey\u00a0of battleground states released this month found Trump winning more than 20% of Black voters in a two-way matchup with Biden, which would amount to a historic high if it translates to votes in November. Trump won roughly 1 in 10 Black voters nationally in 2020, according to multiple estimates, including 12% in\u00a0CNN\u2019s exit poll. Perhaps more worrisome than a shift to Trump, according to some of Biden\u2019s allies, is a fear that Black voters will sit the election out entirely. Nowhere would that be more problematic than in Philadelphia, whose strong showing for Democrats in past elections \u2014 particularly among its Black population \u2014 has helped deliver Pennsylvania\u2019s 19 electoral votes. Biden has aggressively courted Black voters this month, including a multi-day stretch commemorating the\u00a0historic Brown v. Board of Education case that found laws promoting segregation unconstitutional, campaign stops in Atlanta, a commencement address at Morehouse College and a speech at an NAACP dinner in Detroit. He\u2019s also dialed into Black radio programs and touted issues like infrastructure investments and\u00a0canceling student debt when promoting his record to Black voters. Following Wednesday\u2019s rally in Philadelphia, Biden plans to deliver another set of remarks at a Black-owned small business, attended by members of the city\u2019s Black Chamber of Commerce. As the summer progresses, the Black Voters for Biden-Harris organizational effort will partner with community groups to register voters and strengthen voter protection efforts. Key to the effort, the campaign says, will be engagement with networks of \u201ctrusted messengers\u201d within Black communities and engagement events in battleground states \u2014 including at churches, block parties, barber shops and hair salons. Trump has tried in his own way to court Black voters, even as the Republican Party shut down minority outreach centers in some battleground states. Sometimes his efforts have trafficked in stereotypes \u2013 at a gala in South Carolina earlier this year, Trump suggested Black voters like him more after his criminal charges. \u201cA lot of people said that that\u2019s why the\u00a0Black\u00a0people like me because they have been hurt so badly and discriminated against, and they actually viewed me as I\u2019m being discriminated against,\u201d Trump said in February \u2013 comments that the White House and Biden campaign condemned. And at a rally in Bronx last week, Trump sought to showcase his support among the Black community by posing with hip-hop artists\u00a0\u2013 an effort one Biden adviser likened to a \u201cjanky rap concert.\u201d Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, who represents areas of North Philadelphia, rejected the notion Trump was making inroads with Black voters. \u201cYou can go to places where Black people live, but that\u2019s not outreach to the Black community,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cYou look at that crowd on the Bronx. It was a bunch of people who don\u2019t know Jenny from the Block. They\u2019ve never been to the Bronx. They came from wherever they came from, to hear him tell the same lies over and over and over again.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/politics/biden-philadelphia-black-voters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_jill-biden-urges-americans-to-choose-good-over-evil-in-the-election", "text": "First lady Dr. Jill Biden on Wednesday urged Americans to \u201cchoose good over evil\u201d by backing her spouse come November and defended her husband against concerns about his age. The first lady also offered a preview of Biden\u2019s upcoming campaign travel during an interview on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View,\u201d attempting to tamp down concerns amid dismal polling numbers and low enthusiasm for her husband\u2019s reelection campaign. \u201cWe are going to meet people where they are. We\u2019re going to go to college campuses, we\u2019re going to go to just every state that we can get into \u2014 I\u2019ve been traveling every single day, Joe has been traveling as much as possible, and we\u2019re not going to take anything for granted,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd those polls are going to turn, I\u2019m confident of it, because as time goes on, as people start to focus a little bit more about what\u2019s at stake and start to become educated on the issues and the differences between them \u2014 the two men \u2014 I believe that Americans are going to choose good over evil.\u201d The first lady has previously been willing to take on Trump, showing a willingness to take the gloves off and criticize the former president in a way that her husband and his campaign often don\u2019t. Still, the stark characterization of the election as being between good and evil marked a ratcheting up of the first lady\u2019s rhetoric toward Joe Biden\u2019s opponent. Jill Biden was an active surrogate on behalf of her husband in 2020 and\u00a0campaigned for Democratic candidates down the ballot during the 2022 midterm elections. As she\u2019s traveled the country to promote the administration\u2019s initiatives, she\u2019s appeared in a mix of red states and more moderate areas and is expected to take a similar approach in 2024. Biden campaign advisers believe the first lady\u2019s appeal has far reach, particularly with women and grassroots supporters and in moderate parts of the country. The first lady brushed off worries about her husband\u2019s age during the interview with \u201cThe View,\u201d saying he\u2019s not that much older than his opponent. \u201cThis election is not about age,\u201d the first lady said. \u201cI mean, Donald Trump\u2019s going to be, what? 78? Joe\u2019s 81. They\u2019re basically the same age, right? But it\u2019s about character. This election is about character, so you have two choices \u2014\u00a0you have my husband, Joe, who you all know, who has integrity, he\u2019s strong, he\u2019s steady, he\u2019s a leader, he\u2019s smart, he\u2019s energetic \u2014 or you have chaos.\u201d She also previewed some of the president\u2019s strategy leading to CNN\u2019s debate on June 27,\u00a0tamping down concerns that the debate could devolve into a shouting match between the two candidates. \u201cYou know, they built that in, where they\u2019re going to turn off those mics so that somebody can\u2019t ramble or scream at somebody \u2014 not that my husband would be the one doing that \u2014 and so that\u2019s already been negotiated,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the American people deserve a debate, because you need to see your choices. You need to see Trump and you need to see the president, and you need to see the differences, and my husband. You\u2019re going to see how smart he is and the experience he has.\u201d And she blasted Trump, echoing host Joy Behar, as \u201csomeone who can\u2019t put a sentence together,\u201d adding, \u201cI think you deserve \u2014 the American people deserve to see the two men who are running for this office, because your choice is going to be clear.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/politics/jill-biden-urges-americans-to-choose-good-over-evil-in-the-election/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_politics_trump-presidency-memories-biden-analysis", "text": "During Donald Trump\u2019s four years in the White House, he was famously the only president whose job approval rating never reached 50% in Gallup Organization polls since the firm began systematically tracking that measure in the 1940s. But now more positive retrospective assessments of Trump\u2019s record in office are setting off warning flares for Democrats \u2014 especially as President Joe Biden\u2019s own approval ratings remain stuck at historically low levels. In a CNN poll from April, 55% of Americans said they considered Trump\u2019s presidency a success \u2014 a big jump from the 41% who viewed his presidency so positively when he left office in January 2021, according to a CNN survey from the time. If Biden is to win a second term, \u201cthe fact that Trump is getting this level of credit cannot stand,\u201d said Democratic pollster Jay Campbell, who conducts surveys on the economy with a Republican partner for CNBC. It\u2019s not unusual for approval ratings of presidents to rise out of office. The difference is that none of Trump\u2019s defeated predecessors sought to return to the White House four years later. The public\u2019s shifting ratings of those former presidents was of interest mostly to historians; this year, these reassessments will help decide control of the White House. Generally, Biden\u2019s campaign has spent less time challenging Trump\u2019s record in his first term than highlighting what he might do in a second one. But that balance appears to be shifting. Biden\u2019s campaign has invested heavily in emotional swing-state television advertisements that tie Trump to the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning the constitutional right to abortion with the stark concluding tagline: \u201cDonald Trump did this.\u201d Now, Biden\u2019s team is escalating its efforts to contrast his record against some of Trump\u2019s other controversial initiatives. An ad aimed at Black voters that the campaign released Tuesday, for instance, juxtaposes Trump\u2019s attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act with Biden policies that have expanded coverage, lowered premiums under the law and capped the price of insulin at $35 per month. \u201cTrump was a failure on health care,\u201d a narrator declares, before a Black woman in the ad says: \u201cWe cannot go back.\u201d Michael Tyler, the Biden campaign\u2019s communications director, said more of those messages are coming. \u201cThis is exactly why you run a campaign,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cAs we move forward here, reminding people of the damage he caused, the damage he will cause and how he made you feel every single day is imperative.\u201d Almost every president sees their retrospective approval ratings improve after they leave office; when Gallup last measured views of former presidents in 2023, each one it included except for Bill Clinton received a higher approval rating than when they left the White House. Even Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush, the previous two one-term presidents before Trump, were each much more popular in the poll than when they lost their reelection bids. Trump\u2019s recovery since leaving office is \u201cnot a completely new phenomenon,\u201d said Emory University political scientist Alan Abramowitz, who specializes in studying presidential approval. In Gallup\u2019s poll last year, Trump\u2019s retrospective approval rating stood at 46%. That was up 12 percentage points from his final approval rating in office of 34%. Trump\u2019s improvement in the Gallup poll since leaving office was about the same experienced by both Carter and George W. Bush in their first Gallup post-presidential assessments. Other surveys suggest the backward-looking judgments on Trump have further improved since then. In an April national New York Times/Siena College survey, for instance, slightly more registered voters (48%) now say Trump left the country better off than worse off (46%) after his presidency. Nearly two-thirds of voters in the April New York Times/Siena survey said they approved of how Trump handled the economy and about half said they approved of his handling of both immigration and crime. The April national CNN survey conducted by SRSS reported some of the most dramatic change in attitudes. From the 2021 CNN survey until last month\u2019s poll, the share of people who termed Trump\u2019s presidency a success increased more for women than for men; more for people of color than for White voters; more among working-age adults than seniors; and more among Democratic voters than Republican. The 55% in the recent CNN poll who termed Trump\u2019s presidency a success far exceeded the 39% who gave the same positive verdict to Biden\u2019s time. Abramowitz, the political scientist, said that in today\u2019s highly polarized political atmosphere, it\u2019s not surprising that discontent with Biden is boosting Trump, almost in hydraulic fashion. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be an inverse relationship to some extent in how people assess the current president of one party versus the previous president of the opposite party, but given that partisan loyalties are stronger today, that is probably a stronger tendency now,\u201d Abramowitz said. \u201cIf you are unhappy with how things are going now, that may influence your assessment of the previous presidency.\u201d Republican strategist Brad Todd likewise said that Trump, in effect, looks bigger to many voters because Biden looks smaller. \u201cWe judge presidential approval by strength and success more than anything,\u201d Todd said. \u201cPeople think the economy was better when Trump was president, whether they liked him or not, and they think Trump projected strength rather than weakness, and plenty of voters find aspects of Biden\u2019s presidency weak.\u201d The Biden comparison also could be benefiting Trump in a more specific way: by encouraging voters to shift the issues around which they are judging Trump\u2019s tenure. Because inflation, as well as immigration and crime, are much more relevant to voters today, in their retrospective judgments about Trump\u2019s record they may be focusing more on those issues and less on other elements of his presidency that disturbed them at the time, such as his open use of racist language or the general atmosphere of chaos that surrounded his presidency, strategists in both parties said. Jim McLaughlin, a pollster for Trump, pointed mostly to shifting public concerns and the contrast with Biden to explain these post-presidential gains for the former president. When the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN asked voters what issue was most important to their decision in 2020, McLaughlin noted, the survey didn\u2019t include either the cost of living or immigration as a specific choice. That omission, he said, measured how little concern there was in the country at the time about each problem. Now, both of those issues routinely poll near the top of voters\u2019 worries in 2024, with Biden receiving some of his weakest marks on each. To many voters, said McLaughlin, Trump \u201clooks better and better on these issues compared to Joe Biden\u2019s failures.\u201d Many Democratic pollsters say that shift in emphasis about Trump is particularly evident among Black and Hispanic voters, especially younger to middle-aged men. \u201cParticularly among working-class Latinos. \u2026 They will tell us\u00a0that they think he\u2019s racist, xenophobic, anti-immigrant, anti-Latino,\u201d said Ben Tulchin, who served as the principal pollster for Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 two Democratic presidential campaigns.\u00a0\u201cBut then they say, \u2018Comma but,\u2019 and the \u2018but\u2019 is they view his economic record more favorably than Biden\u2019s. Maybe through rose-colored glasses, but that is a challenge the Biden campaign has.\u201d In that New York Times/Siena survey last month, for example, 70% of Hispanic voters said they disapproved of how Biden is handling the economy, while 74% approved of how Trump did. Democrats acknowledge that while it is important for Biden to improve views about his own economic record, it may be difficult for him to tarnish the positive impressions most voters hold about the economy under Trump \u2014 at least before the Covid-19 pandemic struck in 2020. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible to impeach the state of the economy under Trump,\u201d said Campbell. It will not be easy, he added, to say to voters, \u201c\u2018Well, your memory is wrong, things were not that great in the economy under the previous guy.\u2019 I just don\u2019t think that will get them very far.\u201d Rather than trying to erase positive views on Trump\u2019s economic performance, Campbell and other Democrats think Biden could have more success reminding voters about everything else they didn\u2019t like about his time in office. \u201cEconomy aside, you can\u2019t let people think the rest of life was hunky-dory under Donald Trump, because it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cHis approval never got above 50% for a reason. There is plenty to dislike there and plenty that people did dislike.\u201d In fact, while Trump was president, polls underscored the dynamic Campbell describes. In that final CNN/SRSS poll in 2021 before Trump left office, a majority of Americans said they approved of his handling of the economy, but even so, 55% described his presidency as a failure, and just 26% said he had changed the country for the better. The challenge for Democrats, Tulchin said, is that while current conditions are constantly reminding voters that staples like gas, groceries and rent cost less under Trump, the controversies he ignites tend to burn out faster. \u201cWhat we have seen with eight or nine years of life with Trump as a presidential candidate is\u00a0unless the glaring awful things he does are right in people\u2019s faces \u2014 January 6, \u2018good people on both sides\u2019 post-Charlottesville, kids in cages \u2014 then two weeks later, it fades away,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to force people to watch the horrific person that Trump is. They can\u2019t look fondly back on\u00a0five years ago by overlooking his character flaws, because they are major.\u201d The new Biden ad aimed at Black voters released Tuesday may encapsulate the campaign\u2019s emerging approach to talking about Trump\u2019s record. The ad takes one of the most controversial episodes of Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 his attempt to repeal the ACA \u2014 and uses it to create a point of comparison with Biden\u2019s policy initiatives to expand access to health care and to lower medical costs. The same approach is evident in a new Biden ad aimed at Latino voters that contrasts the former president\u2019s policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the border with Biden\u2019s efforts to reunite the families. Another example of that strategy was evident when Biden last week visited Racine, Wisconsin, where Trump had gone as president to trumpet a $10 billion investment from the Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn, which never materialized. Biden was there to tout a $3.3 billion Microsoft investment in an artificial intelligence center on the site, which he offered as evidence for the success of his broader agenda to promote private-sector investment in advanced industries such as clean energy and semiconductors. \u201cFolks, during the previous administration, my predecessor made promises which he broke more than kept and left a lot of people behind in communities like Racine,\u201d Biden declared. \u201cOn my watch, we make promises and we keep promises. And we leave no one behind.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign expresses optimism that by reminding Americans about Trump\u2019s record on these fronts it can move voters \u2014 particularly in core constituencies that have drifted toward Trump such as younger Black and Hispanic men. Trump\u2019s standing with some of these groups may wilt, these Democrats think, simply as he spends more time back in the spotlight. But Todd, like many Republicans, believes Democrats are wrong to assume that more exposure inevitably means less support for Trump. \u201cDemocratic strategists \u2026 have been saying that for a year now,\u201d Todd said. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to reevaluate that geometry.\u201d Refreshing voters about Trump\u2019s prior record could add weight to all of Biden\u2019s warnings about his future plans. Reminding college-educated voters about Trump\u2019s record on abortion and January 6, for instance, could heighten their concern about how basic rights and democracy itself would fare in a second Trump term. Likewise, recalling for Latinos Trump\u2019s family separation policy may add credibility to Democratic warnings about his plans to undertake a mass deportation program of undocumented immigrants, complete with internment camps. If Trump is convicted in his New York hush money trial, in which he\u2019s pleaded not guilty, it will remind voters not only about his willingness to push the boundaries of law and morality, but also the volatility that perpetually envelops him. What\u2019s less clear is whether enough voters will make their decisions in November based on those concerns as opposed to the issues where polls show they now express more faith in Trump than Biden, such as inflation, the border and crime. In the end, what voters remember about Trump\u2019s presidency may be less important than what they prioritize. The real risk for Democrats is that Biden\u2019s present may have irrevocably changed what swing voters care most about in Trump\u2019s past.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/politics/trump-presidency-memories-biden-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_supreme-court-trump-what-matters", "text": "Former President Donald Trump\u2019s favorite Supreme Court justices might not even be the three he nominated. Trump congratulated Justice Samuel Alito, who was nominated in 2005 by then-President George W. Bush, after the jurist on Wednesday refused to recuse himself from cases related to the January 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol or the 2020 election. Alito said in a letter to lawmakers that he didn\u2019t know that his wife had raised an upside-down flag in the days before President Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration in January 2021. In any event, the deeds of his wife, Martha-Ann Alito, don\u2019t meet his threshold for recusal. Alito did not address the \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag \u2013 which some interpret as pushing for more religion in the public space and has also become a symbol for Trump supporters \u2013 that was flown at the justice\u2019s New Jersey beach house last summer. But Trump was doing the social media equivalent of a fist pump at Alito\u2019s declaration when he said this on his social media platform: Congratulations to United States Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito for showing the INTELLIGENCE, COURAGE, and \u201cGUTS\u201d to refuse stepping aside from making a decision on anything January 6th related. All U.S. Judges, Justices, and Leaders should have such GRIT - Our Country would be far more advanced than its current status as A BADLY FAILING NATION, headed by the Worst President in American History, Crooked Joe Biden! The Supreme Court is currently deliberating over whether Trump, as a former president, should enjoy some level of super immunity from prosecution. It\u2019s a complicated case, but certainly Alito was one of the justices most open to immunity claims during oral arguments in April. Alito is also the justice who wrote the decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, the landmark opinion that overturned Roe v. Wade and ended a nationwide right to abortion for American women. While Trump has waffled on how to handle the abortion issue now that there is a patchwork of laws across the country, his latest position is to leave the matter up to states, not unlike what Alito suggested in writing the opinion. The actions of Alito\u2019s wife, flying an upside-down flag as part of a neighborhood dispute over the outcome of the 2020 presidential election, are well within someone\u2019s First Amendment rights. It\u2019s also true that the Alitos\u2019  judgment in how a Supreme Court justice should appear objective is suspect. These relatively innocuous, political expressions pale in comparison to the actions of another Supreme Court spouse: Virginia \u201cGinni\u201d Thomas, who in addition to being married to Justice Clarence Thomas (who was nominated in 1991 by George H.W. Bush) is a conservative activist featured prominently in the House January 6 report. She was actively strategizing around the fake elector scheme by which Trump\u2019s allies wanted to upend Biden\u2019s victory. In text messages with Trump\u2019s White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, Ginni Thomas referred to the 2020 election as a \u201cheist.\u201d She later told the January 6 committee she regretted the messages. Unlike Alito, who responded to lawmakers\u2019 calls for his recusal, Thomas has stayed silent on the matter, although it is clear at this point he will not be recusing himself from any January 6-related cases.

{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_trump-vp-dark-horse", "text": "In recent weeks, an increasingly familiar list of Republicans has dominated the not-very-subtle competition to become Donald Trump\u2019s running mate. Trump himself has added to the air of inevitability by floating these names in interviews and appearances over and over. But there\u2019s a steady drumbeat of speculation within Trump\u2019s orbit that the former president\u2019s flair for\u00a0the dramatic will at some point take over. Many around the campaign believe the lack of secrecy surrounding the open audition\u00a0raises the possibility Trump ultimately picks someone off the public\u2019s radar. \u201cHistorically, the more he says a name, the less likely it is to be that person,\u201d one adviser told CNN, but noted that they too were speculating. Trump has batted around the same names for months and many of them have spent their recent weeks making public demonstrations of their loyalty, appearing outside the Manhattan courthouse where Trump is on trial or defending him on television. When asked about his potential options in an interview last week, Trump responded, \u201cWe have so many, I don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d before rattling off several names frequently mentioned as likely contenders: former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Ohio Sen. J.D.\u00a0Vance and Rep. Elise Stefanik. \u201cBut I could go on for quite a long time,\u201d he added. Trump has also routinely asked allies their thoughts on Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, both of whom have appeared at recent campaign rallies and regularly defend the former president on cable news. Still, a decision is unlikely until right before or at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July,\u00a0as Trump and his team try to build anticipation surrounding an announcement to maximize the political impact of the selection. Against that backdrop, the list of names under consideration seems to be growing, not shrinking. Trump\u2019s openness to feedback from donors, allies and advisers has also left room for those in his orbit to pitch their top choices to the former president and the media alike. In recent weeks, that has included new consideration for Florida Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Bill\u00a0Hagerty\u00a0of Tennessee,\u00a0former Hawaii Rep.\u00a0Tulsi Gabbard and even former South Carolina\u00a0Gov.\u00a0Nikki Haley. Within Trump\u2019s orbit, a growing number of influential voices have encouraged the former president to consider\u00a0picking a running mate who is Hispanic. The search for a potential bilingual running mate who could help make in-roads with a critical voting bloc has often centered on Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants who regularly defends Trump in English and Spanish. But two sources with knowledge of these conversations said Salazar\u2019s name has circulated as well. Salazar, a respected television journalist for Univision before\u00a0winning a seat in Congress in 2020, provided a fierce defense of the former president while attending his hush money trial in New York. Salazar likened the legal case against Trump to the political prosecution remembered by the residents of her district, many of Cuban and Venezuelan decent. \u201cI am here of my own volition, I am not on the list of the favorites, I am not looking for a job and I paid for my own way,\u201d Salazar said outside the Manhattan courthouse, before echoing Trump\u2019s claims of political persecution. \u201cThousands of my constituents back in Miami are terrified when the courts in this country are used as weapons to crush our political enemies.\u201d Salazar and Trump interacted at Mar-a-Lago in recent months, a source familiar with their relationship told CNN. Salazar and her husband, Lester Woerner, a wealthy businessman based in Palm Beach, are friendly with members of the Trump family, the source added. Still, Salazar\u2019s relative inexperience would make her a bold, if not unlikely, dark horse to be first in line to the presidency. Salazar also faces the same\u00a0potential Florida residency\u00a0hurdle as Rubio.\u00a0While there is no law preventing a president and vice president of the US being from the same state,\u00a0Article II of the Constitution prevents electors\u00a0from voting for two people from the same state. The rule would be even more relevant in a close election, and the Trump campaign currently predicts that the 2024 race will be close, according to conversations with multiple Trump advisers. Cotton would bring more than a decade of Washington experience to the ticket \u2013 serving one term in the US House before being elected to the US Senate in 2014 \u2013 as well as a military background. Unlike his Senate colleagues who are regularly asked about running alongside Trump, Cotton had flown under the radar until The New York Times last week reported he had emerged as an unexpected contender for the job. A source confirmed Trump floated Cotton\u2019s name during a recent private dinner, surprising some of his guests. The source, though, also walked away from the interaction believing Trump is not close to landing on a running mate and isn\u2019t yet having serious conversations with his team to narrow the potential field of candidates. \u201cThis is all still in Trump\u2019s mind,\u201d the person said. Another source explained the interest in Cotton as stemming from Trump\u2019s willingness to hear from outside voices \u2013 in this case, allies of Cotton hoping to pique Trump\u2019s interest in the senator. One source in Trump\u2019s orbit insisted that Gabbard, a former Democratic presidential candidate,\u00a0remains under consideration. After the two met, Trump had indicated a strong affinity for Gabbard and her party switch has made her an intriguing surrogate to the former president. But she faces an uphill climb after voting to impeach Trump while in Congress \u2013 a fact he was recently reminded of by his aides, sources close to him said. Another name that\u2019s been floated privately is Tennessee\u2019s Hagerty. At a recent fundraiser in New York hosted by billionaire Howard Lutnick,\u00a0Hagerty\u00a0attended as a special guest alongside most of the Republicans regularly mentioned as top-tier veepstakes contenders. Doug Kaplan, president of Kaplan Strategies, released a poll in April on how potential running mates would fare with Trump in four swing states vs.\u00a0President\u00a0Joe Biden and\u00a0Vice President Kamala Harris. Hagerty was included in the poll (though his name was misspelled with two G\u2019s) along with\u00a0Florida\u00a0Gov. Ron DeSantis,\u00a0South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem,\u00a0Carson, Rubio\u00a0and\u00a0Vance. Kaplan told CNN he included Hagerty because he was \u201ctrying to think outside the box.\u201d \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have great name recognition,\u201d Kaplan said. But he added Hagerty is \u201csomeone Trump respects on foreign policy\u201d and is \u201cone of those do no harm guys.\u201d Others said they had only heard Hagerty\u2019s name floated for roles in a potential Trump administration including national security adviser and secretary of state. Hagerty previously served as ambassador to Japan under Trump. Earlier this year, Hagerty was spotted at Trump International Golf Club\u00a0in West Palm Beach with\u00a0the former president. A source close to Trump called it \u201csimply two friends having lunch.\u201d Some Republicans have privately \u2013 and even publicly \u2013 pitched Trump to assemble a team of rivals that would include Haley as his running mate. Despite having dropped out of the race months ago, Haley has continued to win a significant share of the vote in primary contests, including nearly\u00a017% of the vote last month in Pennsylvania, a critical general election battleground. She also won about 22% of the vote in Indiana\u2019s primary earlier this month, a surprising result in a traditionally red state. Trump himself has referred to Haley as \u201ctough\u201d and told one person recently that she put up a good fight during the contentious fight for the Republican nomination. Haley extended an olive branch last week when she said she would vote for the former president in her first public remarks since ending her own White House bid.\u00a0Still,\u00a0despite Trump\u2019s welcoming her support and indicating she could play a part in the campaign, the two have yet to speak. Republican Rep. Ralph\u00a0Norman of South Carolina, who endorsed\u00a0Haley\u00a0in the primary before switching his support to\u00a0Trump, said he believes she should be on the GOP ticket \u2014an argument he made to both Republicans. \u201cFor Nikki\u00a0Haley, in Indiana, to pull over 20% and not be on the ballot is amazing,\u201d\u00a0Norman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s why she would make a great VP candidate. And I made that pitch to President\u00a0Trump\u00a0and also to Nikki\u00a0Haley.\u201d Norman said that while\u00a0Haley\u00a0has not expressed interest in joining\u00a0Trump\u2019s ticket, he believes she would consider it. \u201cPolitics is an interesting game,\u201d\u00a0Norman said. \u201cPeople can forget the past and look forward to the future.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/politics/trump-vp-dark-horse/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_11_politics_trump-schedule-court-campaign", "text": "Former President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that his criminal trial in Manhattan has prevented him from campaigning in key swing states. \u201cI should be right now in Pennsylvania, in Florida, in many other states, North Carolina, Georgia - campaigning,\u201d Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, told reporters outside the courtroom on the second day of the trial in April. He made\u00a0similar\u00a0comments in the courthouse hallway on subsequent days,\u00a0saying\u00a0that, if not for the trial he baselessly blamed on President Joe Biden, he was \u201csupposed to be\u201d in Ohio, New Hampshire and South Carolina. It\u2019s certainly possible that Trump would have been campaigning in all of those states if there was no trial. But a review of his activities over the trial\u2019s first four weeks shows that he has done little campaign travel, and held few public campaign events, on days off from court. Instead, he has spent most of his 12 court-free days out of voters\u2019 view at his properties in New York, New Jersey and Florida. And he did not use any of those 12 court-free days to visit Pennsylvania, Georgia, South Carolina, Ohio or New Hampshire, states he asserted the trial was preventing him from visiting. (He is\u00a0scheduled\u00a0to visit Ohio for a fundraiser\u00a0on May 15.) No public events on most free days Trump\u2019s trial is not in session on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays, and the judge also scheduled one Monday off in late April.\u00a0As of this Saturday, May 11,\u00a0that left Trump with 12 court-free days to do as he pleased, compared to 15 days where he was required in court, in the\u00a027 days\u00a0beginning with the\u00a0opening of jury selection on April 15. Trump held no public events on\u00a0seven of the 12 court-free days. And it was no public events on eight of the 12 days\u00a0if you don\u2019t count his one-minute-long appearance for the cameras prior to a private meeting with the president of Poland at Trump Tower in New York City. Trump has visited few swing states since the trial began Trump has done some campaign travel during the trial. He held campaign rallies in the swing states of\u00a0Wisconsin and Michigan on one court-free Wednesday in May, and he booked a weekend April rally in the swing state of North Carolina that was\u00a0called off at the last minute because of severe weather.(He attended a closed-door\u00a0fundraiser\u00a0in the state earlier in the day.) He\u00a0is scheduled to hold\u00a0a rally on Saturday afternoon\u00a0in New Jersey, which has for three decades been a Democratic stronghold in presidential elections, and he\u00a0appeared in May at a Formula One race in Miami. Trump also made campaign-style appearances in Democratic-dominated New York City before or after\u00a0three\u00a0court\u00a0appearances. And he has turned the hallway outside the Manhattan courtroom into a de facto campaigning venue, regularly speaking to media cameras before and after sitting in court. But he has let the majority of the 12 off days pass\u00a0without doing any public campaign events. Instead, he has spent some of the time\u00a0golfing at his Bedminster club in New Jersey,\u00a0attending\u00a0a Republican National Committee fundraiser at his Mar-a-Lago club and residence in Florida, attending a Mar-a-Lago\u00a0dinner\u00a0for people who bought large numbers of his \u201cNFT\u201d digital trading cards, and\u00a0making phone calls and holding meetings. His complete itinerary on the off days is not known. Here is a list showing how he is known to have spent his time from the opening day of the trial, April 15,\u00a0until May 11. April 15: Court April 16: Court (made appearance at New York City bodega afterward) April 17: Day off court.

Thomas Webster, a former New York Police Department officer who\u00a0was found guilty in\u00a02022 of assaulting a police officer during the riot, had challenged his conviction on that and other grounds. His legal arguments echoed public comments about the partisan bent of DC from\u00a0Trump\u00a0and his allies about the criminal case the former president faces in the nation\u2019s capital for his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election. The DC US Circuit Court of Appeals, in an opinion written by Barack Obama-appointed Judge Patricia Millett and joined by Judges Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao, both Trump appointees, rejected the version of the argument put forward by Webster. \u201cWebster asserts that the District overwhelmingly voted for President Biden and historically votes for Democratic candidates. \u2026 That may be,\u201d Millett wrote. \u201cBut the political inclinations of a populace writ large say nothing about an individual\u2019s ability to serve impartially in adjudicating the criminal conduct of an individual.\u201d She pointed to the prosecution of aides to President Richard Nixon for their role in the Watergate cover-up, and wrote that the appeals court \u201cheld that District juries could impartially adjudicate other criminal cases arising out of political matters, including Watergate.\u201d Her opinion also brushed off polling data Webster had offered about the sentiments that the district jury\u2019s pool have about the Capitol attack. The survey of 400 people registered to vote in DC found that they had a \u201cdecidedly negative impression of individuals arrested in conjunction with the activities of January 6, 2021.\u201d The DC Circuit said that \u201cWebster\u2019s focus on the jury pool\u2019s opinion of January 6th and its perpetrators misses the point.\u201d \u201cWe expect jurors to view significant criminal events in their hometown with an unapproving eye, whether it is the January 6th attack on the Capitol, a murder, or an armed robbery spree,\u201d Millett wrote. \u201cGeneralized disapproval of criminal conduct \u2014 even the specific conduct at issue in a defendant\u2019s case \u2014 says nothing about a juror\u2019s ability to be impartial in deciding whether a particular individual committed a crime or not.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/politics/appeals-court-jury-pool-january-6/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_alito-flag-controversy-response-supreme-court", "text": "Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito told lawmakers in a letter Wednesday that he will not recuse from cases involving the 2020 presidential election or the January 6, 2021, US Capitol riot despite concerns about two controversial flags that have flown on his properties. \u201cThe two incidents you cite do not meet the conditions for recusal,\u201d Alito wrote in a letter distributed by the Supreme Court. \u201cAs I have stated publicly, I had nothing whatsoever to do with the flying of that flag. I was not even aware of the upside-down flag until it was called to my attention.\u201d The letter is a highly unusual response, underscoring how the revelations about the flags have dogged Alito for days. Supreme Court justices rarely get into a back-and-forth with lawmakers and many members of the court do not explain their reasons for recusing \u2013 or not. The Supreme Court is weighing major cases tied to the 2020 election and the attack on the US Capitol. In one, the justices are weighing former President Donald Trump\u2019s claim of absolute immunity from special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election subversion charges. In another, a January 6 rioter is challenging an obstruction charge filed against him by prosecutors, arguing that Congress intended that law to apply to people destroying evidence, not storming a government building. Repeating claims he made previously about an upside-down US flag that flew at his Alexandria, Virginia, home in early 2021, Alito said the decision to place the flag was his wife\u2019s. And he blamed that decision on a \u201cvery nasty neighborhood dispute.\u201d \u201cMy wife is a private citizen, and she possesses the same First Amendment rights as every other American,\u201d Alito wrote in one of two letters sent to members of Congress. \u201cShe makes her own decisions, and I have always respected her right to do so.\u201d \u201cMy wife is fond of flying flags,\u201d Alito wrote. \u201cI am not.\u201d Appeal to Heaven flag controversy A second controversial flag \u2013 the \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag which has a history dating to the Revolutionary War, but also has become a symbol for Trump supporters \u2013 flew at the Alitos\u2019 vacation home in New Jersey. The justice on Wednesday said he was aware of the flag but didn\u2019t know how long it was flown. Alito said he was not familiar with the flag\u2019s meaning and said his wife, Martha-Ann Alito, also hoisted that one. \u201cI had no involvement in the decision to fly that flag,\u201d Alito wrote. \u201cI was not aware of any connection between that historic flag and the \u2018Stop the Steal Movement,\u2019 and neither was my wife. She did not fly it to associate herself with that or any other group, and the use of an old historic flag by a new group does not necessarily drain that flag of all other meanings.\u201d Citing the code of conduct the Supreme Court adopted recently in response to another series of scandals, Alito said the flags did not constitute grounds for recusal. Alito said he was \u201cduty bound\u201d to reject requests from members of Congress to recuse. One of the letters was addressed to Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who had requested that Alito recuse from cases involving the attack on the Capitol. Another was addressed to members of the House who had made similar demands. \u201cA reasonable person who is not motivated by political or ideological considerations or a desire to affect the outcome of Supreme Court cases would conclude that this event does not meet the applicable standard for recusal,\u201d Alito wrote. \u201cI am therefore duty-bound to reject your recusal request.\u201d Rep. Hank Johnson, a Georgia Democrat who serves on the House Judiciary Committee, said Alito\u2019s response demonstrated a need for Congress to step in to approve an enforceable code of ethics on the high court. \u201cAny unbiased and reasonable person would find laughable Justice Alito\u2019s \u2018the dog ate my homework, and I didn\u2019t even know I had homework\u2019 defense,\u201d Johnson said. Spat with neighbors The revelation of the flag came from a May 17 report from the New York Times. The outlet published a photo of the inverted American flag on January 17, 2021. Following the story, Alito said in a statement he had \u201cno involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag\u201d and that it was \u201cbriefly\u201d flown by his wife in response to a neighbor\u2019s yard signs, one of which, the justice told Fox News, read \u201cF**k Trump.\u201d Neighbors with whom CNN spoke following reports of the flag said they recalled the flag being inverted but said they didn\u2019t know what it meant and there was no public reaction at the time. According to the Times, a neighbor involved in the exchange with\u00a0Martha-Ann Alito\u00a0called police after several encounters with the justice\u2019s wife in early 2021, after the neighbor had placed yard signs which were critical of Republicans and the justice. Justice Alito also told Fox News the neighbor used the term \u201cc*nt\u201d at one point during the exchanges. Pictures obtained by the Times show the neighbor holding signs that include \u201cAlito was @ Jan6\u201d along with \u201cAbort SCOTUS\u201d following the ruling 2022 overturning Roe v. Wade.

{"id": "2024_05_25_politics_trump-trial-key-moments-what-matters", "text": "With a holiday weekend happening between the final witness testimony and closing arguments in former President Donald Trump\u2019s New York hush money criminal trial, it\u2019s worth taking a moment to look back at what we\u2019ve just seen. CNN\u2019s Kara Scannell, Lauren del Valle and Jeremy Herb were inside the courtroom and an adjacent viewing room for all of the oral arguments \u2013 for all 20 days over the course of a month when the trial was in session. While these are the first criminal trial proceedings against Trump, he also faced a civil fraud trial brought by the New York attorney general and two separate defamation lawsuits brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll. A judge found Trump liable for fraud for inflating his net worth to get friendly loans, and juries found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defaming Carroll. CNN\u2019s reporters have covered all of the trials. I talked to Herb and del Valle about how they went about getting what happened in court out to the world in almost real time and what people watching on TV might have missed. Portions of those conversations, conducted by phone and email and edited for length, are below: What will you take away from covering this trial? DEL VALLE: This is actually my fourth Trump trial. They\u2019ve all been different. This is the first one where he\u2019s had to be there every second. We saw different versions of him, I would say, at each trial. He didn\u2019t show up to the first E. Jean Carroll trial. He came to some of civil fraud trial for big days. He did briefly get up on the stand, and that was a moment in itself that we didn\u2019t get to see here in the criminal trial. We saw a very angry Trump at the second E. Jean Carroll trial where he walked out of closing, was very emotional and had tension with the judge. Here, it\u2019s almost been interesting how at moments it just felt like a regular trial. That\u2019s never really been the case; we go through two levels of security, we have to wait in line hours before the trial starts, and we\u2019re very much controlled by the security for Trump, and that\u2019s not normal. But at the same time, Trump as a defendant has to sit there every second of the day. There are times where you can forget that you are watching the first former president to be on trial facing criminal charges. It\u2019s a shake yourself kind of moment to see him sit there like any other defendant I\u2019ve seen in that courtroom facing what could be a conviction. How did you cover a trial without cameras in real time for coverage on TV? HERB: Kara, Lauren and I watched every day of the trial unfold from two places: inside the courtroom or in an \u201coverflow\u201d auxiliary courtroom, where the proceedings were played on closed-circuit television. This was a historic trial, of course, and we used a brand-new method of filing updates to try to keep readers and viewers informed of what was happening literally second by second. This was possible because the press corps was allowed to use laptops in court (strictly no recording!), so we frantically took notes and then transmitted what we were seeing in real time to a Slack channel. From there, our editors quickly read our Slacks and added them to\u00a0CNN.com\u2019s live story, as well as to a \u201csidestream\u201d feed that was displayed live on air. The idea was to put readers and viewers in the room as best we could \u2013 our dispatches were sent mostly in single sentences so that we could keep updating as quickly as possible. Between the three of us, we tried to capture every moment, big and small, both in terms of quotes being said by the attorneys and witnesses as well as how others in the courtroom \u2013 mainly Trump \u2013 were reacting to what was happening. What did TV viewers miss? HERB: We tried to use descriptive language to describe what we were seeing and hearing, but words can only go so far to replace audio or video. I think it was often hard to capture the tone of a conversation, particularly when it got contentious. We also couldn\u2019t really convey what the jury was thinking \u2013 reporters were far enough away from the jurors that we could see them taking notes or watching the lawyers and witnesses, but it\u2019s hard to know whether they were truly engaged or how they were taking any given bit of testimony. What could you see of Trump? HERB: We made sure to have at least one person in the courtroom and one in overflow, because they give you two different vantage points. Reporters in the courtroom sat behind Trump \u2013 with a view often blocked by the many officers in the aisles of the gallery. In the overflow room, there was a big-screen TV set up that showed four shots: the prosecutors, the defense table, the judge and the witness. From the overflow room, that gave us a clear view of Trump\u2019s face, meaning we could see whether his eyes were closed (which didn\u2019t mean he was necessarily sleeping!). We could also see when he smirked or smiled at something or was writing and passing notes to his attorneys. From the courtroom, that same TV feed was displayed, but it was on a much smaller screen and farther away \u2013 some reporters had binoculars to try to get a better view. What were the most dramatic moments? During Stormy Daniels\u2019 testimony \u2026 DEL VALLE: Midway through the trial, Stormy, in vivid detail, describing certain things that were entirely taboo, that we wouldn\u2019t really expect to hear in a courtroom, was certainly, I wouldn\u2019t say dramatic, but it was definitely a moment that became a sideshow. It\u2019s not necessarily directly tied to the allegations or the charges in this case, but hearing her describe this alleged night with Trump in the hotel room, down to the anecdote of her smacking him on the butt with a magazine and his reaction in court, audibly cursing at that moment, was definitely a memory. During Michael Cohen\u2019s testimony \u2026 DEL VALLE: Then, during Cohen\u2019s testimony, on cross-examination (Trump attorney) Todd Blanche built up into what Blanche clearly thought was a gotcha moment, suggesting that Cohen made up a call keeping Trump informed in the Daniels scheme. Blanche suggested it was actually a call with Trump\u2019s bodyguard, Keith Schiller, about a 14-year-old prankster who had been prank calling Cohen \u2026 in that moment, Blanche was flailing his arms, yelling in a high-pitched tone, telling Cohen he made this up. Cohen responded that, well, no, I think we could have talked about both things at the same time, or I believe this is the call. And Blanche told him the jury isn\u2019t here to hear what you believe. They need to know what the facts are. And that was right before a lunch break, and it kind of left energy in the room, and set a tone for the rest of the day. When the judge cleared the courtroom \u2026 HERB: The most dramatic moment I think happened when the jury was out of the room during the testimony of the final witness, Robert Costello. His testimony had been limited by the judge ahead of time, and prosecutors were successfully objecting repeatedly to Trump lawyer Emil Bove\u2019s questions. Costello was visibly annoyed at this, and even uttered \u201cridiculous\u201d while the attorneys were at a sidebar with the judge. When he let out a \u201cjeez\u201d after another objection, Judge Juan Merchan excused the jury to admonish the decorum of the witness, (who is) an attorney and former federal prosecutor. That\u2019s when things really got heated. \u201cAre you staring me down right now?\u201d Merchan said to Costello after dressing him down. \u201cClear the courtroom!\u201d the judge announced, leading to chaos as court officers forced reporters \u2013 and the attorney representing the media \u2013 to leave the courtroom over vigorous objections. DEL VALLE: I\u2019ve been in this courtroom for other trials many times. I have not seen a judge clear the courtroom of press to admonish a witness in a sidebar in such a way. The way Merchan handled that was definitely a surprise. How did Trump interact with the friends and aides whom he had not spoken to in some time and who testified for the prosecution? David Pecker, Trump\u2019s longtime friend who tried to use the National Enquirer to help \u201ccatch and kill\u201d stories that could hurt Trump \u2026 DEL VALLE: It felt like by the end, Pecker was maybe trying to send Trump a message. Even though they have not spoken since all of this unraveled in 2018, Pecker made a point of saying really positive things about Trump. How long they\u2019ve known each other and had a really strong relationship. How, even though they haven\u2019t spoken recently, Trump has sent him a hello through other people that he\u2019s run into. He still considers Trump a friend all these years later. By the end there, it felt like Trump was watching him and listening to these words, like, who knows, maybe they could be friends publicly again. Hope Hicks, Trump\u2019s former campaign press secretary and White House communications director who has since moved on from Trump\u2019s orbit \u2026 DEL VALLE: It was interesting because she made a point of saying that she was paying for her own attorney. She was not by any means still tied to Trump, but she was actually overcome with emotion when they started the cross-examination. She was so nervous the whole time, but especially when it came to how she might be treated by Trump\u2019s side. I think her candor also caught Trump\u2019s attention, and he was definitely watching her at times \u2013 most of her testimony, actually. Madeleine Westerhout, Trump\u2019s former personal assistant at the White House \u2026 DEL VALLE: The one where it definitely felt like there was a connection \u2013 they exchanged eye contact when she came off the stand \u2013 was Madeleine Westerhout, who cried on the stand, was very emotional about the mistakes she made that led to her exit from the White House. She made clear how apologetic she was and what a great man she felt Trump was. He definitely was paying close attention to her and smiled at her at times, and seemed to give her a nod and a smile and maybe exchanged words with her on her way off the stand. Where were Trump\u2019s many supporters, including high-ranking Republican lawmakers? Was there any indication jurors recognized them? HERB: Both the prosecution and the defense were given the first two rows of seats behind their tables in the well for guests. On the prosecution side, District Attorney Alvin Bragg would sit here whenever he popped into the courtroom. On Trump\u2019s side, this was where the Republican lawmakers and other allies of Trump would sit. Trump aide Boris Epshteyn would often direct traffic and make sure they found their seats. On some days, Trump had so many people attending that a few would get relegated to the back row. As for the jury, it\u2019s hard to say whether they recognized any of the VIP guests. Every time they entered the courtroom, they walked past Trump\u2019s table \u2013 and 99% of the time, all of them looked straight ahead and not at the defendant or his guests. What less dramatic moments stand out? DEL VALLE: With Stormy, it was definitely interesting and we tried to describe it, but she was talking a mile a minute. The court reporter could not keep up at all. The prosecutor and the judge had to stop her several times to ask her to slow down. And at one point later in the day, on her direct examination, she leaned over to the court reporter and smiled at her, and said, \u201cAm I talking slower? Can you get it all?\u201d HERB: One of the things that isn\u2019t obvious if you aren\u2019t watching the proceedings is how collegial the lawyers on the opposing sides can be, even as they are viciously fighting against each other on the case and in rulings to try to help their side. During breaks, Blanche would occasionally jump to the other side of the well to speak with his counterparts, Susan Hoffinger or Joshua Steinglass, and more than a few laughs were shared with whatever it was they were discussing. While the press took up the majority of the seats, there were spaces dedicated to the general public \u2013 and some regulars who showed up every day, either sleeping overnight or, more likely, hiring line sitters who had a lucrative business throughout the trial saving spots in lines outside the courthouse for both media and the general public. My favorite light moment in court may have come when Trump attorney Emil Bove was cross-examining a paralegal for the district attorney\u2019s office, Jaden Jarmel-Schneider, who was testifying to enter into evidence call logs he had analyzed for the case. Bove asked him if putting together call summary charges could be \u201cat times, arguably, tedious work?\u201d \u201cHonestly, I kind of enjoyed it,\u201d Jarmel-Schneider said. The response prompted one of the biggest laughs in the courtroom in the entire trial \u2013 even several jurors were laughing. \u201cI hear that,\u201d Bove said in response. \u201cRespect.\u201d What will stick with you from covering this moment of history? HERB: This has easily been one of the most intense assignments I\u2019ve ever had at CNN. Not only is it historic and unprecedented, but the way we are covering it requires a constant focus throughout every hour of every day of the trial \u2013 and every moment, dramatic or monotonous \u2013 in order to make sure we are conveying it to our readers and viewers quickly and accurately. My hope is that I will be able look back at this unprecedented trial and be able to say we covered the historic moment fast and got it right (which I am not taking for granted until the trial is over!).", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/politics/trump-trial-key-moments-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_rfk-jr-fec-complaint-cnn-debate", "text": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s campaign filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission on Tuesday alleging President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign, former President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and CNN violated federal campaign laws in scheduling the network\u2019s\u00a0June 27 presidential debate. The complaint alleges CNN \u201ccolluded\u201d with the Biden and Trump campaigns in scheduling the debate and setting debate qualification criteria, which the Kennedy team claims amounts to \u201cprohibited corporate contributions\u201d to both campaigns. The Biden campaign directed a request for comment to the Democratic National Committee, which declined to comment. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Kennedy campaign asks the FEC to bar the campaigns and CNN from holding the debate until they address the alleged breaches in federal law. The complaint marks the latest step in Kennedy\u2019s push to appear on the debate stage alongside Biden and Trump. He has frequently argued that the scheduling of the debate unfairly excluded him since the\u00a0event was announced earlier this month. In order to participate in CNN\u2019s debate, candidates must be qualified on enough state ballots to be eligible for 270 electoral votes. Candidates must also earn at least 15% support in four national polls that meet CNN\u2019s polling standards. The window for candidates to earn qualifying polls opened March 13th\u00a0and closes seven days prior to the debate. Kennedy has qualified for the ballot in six states, making him eligible for 89 Electoral College votes. He has earned at least 15% support in three qualifying polls. The Kennedy campaign argues that the qualification criteria are not objective and claims Biden and Trump would not be qualified on any states\u2019 ballot because their parties\u2019 nominating conventions will occur after the debate. \u201cBy demanding our campaign meet different criteria to participate in the debate than Presidents Biden and Trump, CNN\u2019s debate violates FEC law and is a large prohibited corporate contribution to both the Biden and Trump campaigns,\u201d Kennedy said in a statement announcing the filing. A CNN spokesperson said both Biden and Trump will meet the ballot access criteria as the presumptive nominees of their parties. \u201cThe law in virtually every state provides that the nominee of a state-recognized political party will be allowed ballot access without petitioning. As the presumptive nominees of their parties both Biden and Trump will satisfy this requirement. As an independent candidate, under applicable laws RFK Jr. does not. The mere application for ballot access does not guarantee that he will appear on the ballot in any state. In addition, RFK, Jr. does not currently meet our polling criteria, which, like the other objective criteria, were set before issuing invitations to the debate,\u201d the spokesperson said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/politics/rfk-jr-fec-complaint-cnn-debate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_politics_dnc-virtual-roll-call-biden-ohio", "text": "The Democratic National Committee is planning to hold a virtual roll call ahead of the party\u2019s August convention to nominate President Joe Biden in order to meet an Ohio ballot access deadline. The move comes after the Republican-controlled Ohio legislature failed to pass legislation to move back the state\u2019s August 7 deadline for political parties to submit their official nominees. The Democratic convention is taking place August 19-22. \u201cJoe Biden will be on the ballot in Ohio and all 50 states, and Ohio Republicans agree,\u201d DNC Chairman Jaime Harrison said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cBut when the time has come for action, they have failed to act every time, so Democrats will land this plane on our own.\u201d The\u00a0decision by the DNC\u00a0comes after Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine last week called for a special session starting Tuesday to pass legislation to fix the ballot issue. The DNC\u2019s plans were first reported by the Columbus Dispatch and the Washington Post. A virtual roll call would resolve an ongoing struggle between the Biden campaign and GOP officials in the Buckeye State. Last month, legal counsel for Ohio\u2019s Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose warned the campaign that the convention, when the party is expected to formally nominate Biden, will occur after the state\u2019s certification deadline. Democrats\u00a0held\u00a0a remote vote before the convention during the pandemic in 2020. Under that process, delegates were sent individualized ballots, with all votes cast and counted before the convention officially began. During the convention, the party played a\u00a0virtual roll call\u00a0which featured videos and live shots from around the country. The party is planning to formally introduce a resolution to allow for a virtual roll call next week, before sending the measure for a vote by the whole committee. In previous cycles, early certification deadlines were resolved without much fanfare. States have either accepted provisional certification from the parties ahead of their conventions or passed legislation to move back the deadline to accommodate late conventions. Earlier this month, Alabama\u2019s Republican-led legislature moved back the deadline to clear the way for Biden to make the ballot there. Officials in Washington, which also has an earlier deadline than most states, said they would accept a provisional certification. Ohio officials declined to accept a provisional certification and efforts to resolve the issue legislatively failed. State lawmakers in Ohio voted to move back the deadline ahead of the 2012 and 2020 party conventions. Holding a virtual roll call is one of several options Democrats weighed to keep Biden on the ballot. While holding part of the convention virtually could distract from the in-person activities, it is less contentious than a possible legal challenge. Legislative efforts failed after Ohio Republicans sought to extract concessions from Democrats. And while Ohio is no longer a presidential swing state \u2013 former President Donald Trump won there in 2020 by 8 points \u2013 Biden\u2019s presence on the ballot could be decisive in down ballot races, including Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown\u2019s reelection bid.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/politics/dnc-virtual-roll-call-biden-ohio/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_politics_rfk-jr-robert-e-lee-statute-charlottesville", "text": "Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he had a \u201cvisceral reaction against\u201d the removal of the statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee that was once the focal point of the deadly 2017 \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Kennedy said\u00a0in an interview\u00a0with podcast host Tim Pool on Friday that he opposes \u201cdestroying history\u201d when asked about the Charlottesville City Council\u2019s decision in 2021 to remove the town\u2019s statute of Lee and melt it down to create new public art. Kennedy, who went to law school at the University of Virginia, said he had a personal reaction to seeing the statue removed. \u201cI have a visceral reaction against the attacks on those statues,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cThere were heroes in the Confederacy who didn\u2019t have slaves, and you know, I just have a visceral reaction against destroying history. I don\u2019t like it.\u201d \u201cI think we should celebrate who we are,\u201d Kennedy added. \u201cWe should celebrate the good qualities of everybody.\u201d The 2017 decision to remove the statute of Lee from a park in Charlottesville sparked outrage, including from White nationalist sympathizers who gathered at the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d protest that August and violently clashed with counter-protesters. Heather Heyer, a counter-protester, was killed when a man drove his car into a crowd. Kennedy said he doesn\u2019t \u201cthink it\u2019s a good, a healthy thing for any culture to erase its history,\u201d and suggested historical figures like Lee should be celebrated for their positive qualities even if they also took actions that are now \u201cregarded as immoral \u2026 or wrong.\u201d \u201cWe need to be able to be sophisticated enough to live with, you know, our ancestors who didn\u2019t agree with us on everything, and who did things that are now, you know, regarded as immoral, you know, or wrong,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cMaybe they had other qualities that we want to celebrate.\u201d \u201cClearly, Robert E. Lee had extraordinary qualities of leadership,\u201d he added. Kennedy also defended his past celebration of Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day, a holiday celebrated on Columbus Day borne out of Native American advocacy to honor Indigenous peoples who inhabited the Americas. Pool, the podcast host, accused Kennedy of seeking to erase Christopher Columbus\u2019 legacy by celebrating Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day, but Kennedy argued both holidays can be honored alongside each other. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for us to be part of a community where we can recognize all kinds of people. We can recognize Italian Americans to whom that is an important holiday, and at the same time, we can recognize the indigenous people who were, you know, made the ultimate sacrifice of one of the greatest genocides in the history,\u201d Kennedy said. At a rally in Philadelphia in October, during which he formally announced his switch from running in the Democratic primary to running as an independent, Kennedy said it\u2019s \u201ca hopeful sign\u201d that the US celebrates Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day. Prior to his remarks, Kennedy was introduced by Lewis GrassRope, a member of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe. \u201cIt\u2019s a hopeful sign now for our country that we celebrate Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day,\u201d Kennedy said last October. \u201cIt shows that our country is now ready to explore and to tell each other the untold histories of those dispossessed people who have previously languished on the margins.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/politics/rfk-jr-robert-e-lee-statute-charlottesville/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_tennessee-governor-abortion-trafficking-minors-law", "text": "Tennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee on Tuesday signed a\u00a0bill\u00a0into law that criminalizes \u201cabortion trafficking of a minor,\u201d the latest GOP-led state to\u00a0reduce access to abortion following the reversal of Roe v. Wade. The new law is aimed at preventing assistance to minors seeking to obtain an abortion. It does not apply to the parents or legal guardian of the minor. Under the measure,\u00a0a person who helps a minor obtain an abortion, or abortion-inducing drugs, without consent from the minor\u2019s parent, could be sued for money damages by the minor, by the minor\u2019s parents, or by the\u00a0biological\u00a0father. Tennessee joins a number of Republican-led states that have restrictions on abortion either taking effect or enacted for the first time following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in 2022 that overturned the federal right to an abortion. While abortion is\u00a0already banned\u00a0in Tennessee \u2013 with no exceptions for rape or incest \u2013 the new law creates a new layer of punishment for those seeking to help minors obtain an abortion. The law, which takes effect July 1, applies regardless of whether the pregnant minor \u201cconsented to the actions that led to the offense,\u201d\u00a0according to the law, which is a Class A misdemeanor offense and carries a sentence of 11 months and 29 days in prison. Before the measure was signed into law, Bryan Davidson, policy director at the ACLU of Tennessee,\u00a0said\u00a0it \u201charms young people\u2019s ability to access the support of those they trust when they need it most and is an unprecedented attack on the First Amendment right to free speech and expression.\u201d \u201cIt is absurd and cruel to force a pregnant young person to navigate laws and systems that are designed to deprive them of their own bodily autonomy, while simultaneously removing the ability for trusted adults to provide guidance and support when they need it most,\u201d Davidson wrote in a letter to Lee last month. CNN has reached out to Lee\u2019s office for comment. The new law is similar to an Idaho\u00a0\u201cabortion trafficking\u201d\u00a0measure that GOP Gov. Brad Little\u00a0signed\u00a0last year.

{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_turnout-2024-election-analysis", "text": "For decades, Democrats have built their electoral strategies on a common assumption: the higher the turnout, the better their chances of winning. But that familiar equation may no longer apply for President Joe Biden in 2024. A wide array of polls this year shows Biden running best among Americans with the most consistent history of voting, while former President Donald Trump often displays the most strength among people who have been the least likely to vote. These new patterns are creating challenges for each party. Trump\u2019s potential appeal to more irregular voters, particularly younger Black and Latino men, is compelling Democrats to rethink longstanding strategies that focused on mobilizing as many younger and non-White voters as possible without worrying about their partisan allegiance. For Republicans, the challenge will be to build an organization capable of connecting with irregular voters they have not traditionally focused on reaching, particularly in minority communities. \u201cWhat all this means is this election has volatility,\u201d says Daniel Hopkins, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist who has studied the widening partisan divergence between voters with and without a consistent history of turning out. \u201cWe used to expect that the marginal non-voter, the next voter who turned out if an election was very engaging, didn\u2019t look different from people who did vote. In this case, the crowd that hasn\u2019t gotten engaged looks very, very different.\u201d Merged results from the three most recent national NBC polls, conducted by a bipartisan team of prominent Democratic and Republican pollsters, for instance, found that Biden leads Trump by 4 percentage points among people who voted in both 2020 and 2022. But among those who voted in 2020 but not 2022, Trump led Biden by 12 percentage points. Trump\u2019s lead swelled to 20 percentage points among those who did not vote in either 2020 or 2022. Fully 65% of those who did not vote in either of the past two elections said they disapproved of Biden\u2019s performance in office. Combined results from recent national New York Times/Siena College polls likewise have found Biden narrowly leading among potential 2024 voters who turned out in 2020 while trailing Trump by double digits among those who did not vote in their previous contest. Hopkins has conducted perhaps the most ambitious attempt to quantify the divergence between Americans with and without a history of voting. Earlier this year, he and a colleague worked with NORC at the University of Chicago to survey over 2,400 adults about their preferences in the 2024 race. The poll only surveyed people who were old enough to vote in each of the past three elections \u2014 the midterms of 2018 and 2022 and the 2020 presidential race. The results were striking. Among adults who had voted in each of the past three federal elections, Biden led Trump by 11 points, and Biden eked out a narrow advantage among voters who participated in two of the past three races. But, the poll found, Trump led Biden by 12 percentage points among those who voted in just one of the past three elections and by a crushing margin of 18 percentage points among those who came out for none of them. As important, the pattern held across racial lines. In the poll, Trump ran even with Biden among Latinos who voted in two, one or none of the past three elections, while Biden held a nearly 20-point advantage among those who voted in all three. With Black voters, Biden\u2019s lead was just 10 points among those who did not show up for any of the past three elections, but over 80 points among those who participated in all three. Using data from Catalist, a leading Democratic voter targeting firm, Michael Podhorzer, the former political director of the AFL-CIO, reached similar conclusions. He found that in 2020 Biden\u2019s margins over Trump were higher among people who voted in the three previous elections of 2018, 2016 and 2014 than those who voted in some or none of them \u2014 and that the relationship held across racial lines. Hopkins said the gap between habitual and irregular voters in his latest survey was far greater than the difference he found when he conducted a similar poll early in the 2016 race between Trump and Hillary Clinton. Key to this widening chasm, he believes, may be another dynamic: Adults who are less likely to vote are also less likely to follow political news. \u201cFor more infrequent voters, these are often people who pay less attention to politics and whose political barometer is more the question of how is my family doing economically, how does the country seem to be doing,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cFor those voters, Donald Trump\u2026is not especially unusual.\u201d By contrast, Hopkins said, a \u201csizable sliver\u201d of habitual voters \u201chave a sense that Trump may be qualitatively different than other political candidates with respect to norm violations and January 6.\u201d\u00a0For less frequent voters, he added, the equation may be as simple as \u201cthey don\u2019t love what they see with Joe Biden, and if Donald Trump is the person running against Joe Biden, they want change.\u201d The NBC polling results buttress that conclusion: It found that among the roughly one-sixth of voters who say they do not follow political news, Trump led Biden by fully 2-to-1. Several analysts caution that while this divergence between high- and low-frequency voters is appearing consistently in polls now, it\u2019s too early to say for certain whether it will persist through Election Day. \u201cIt\u2019s May,\u201d said Republican pollster Bill McInturff, whose firm conducts the NBC poll with a Democratic partner. \u201cThis data matters when people start having to vote.\u201d Democratic strategist Tom Bonier pointed out that public opinion surveys often have enough trouble measuring attitudes among young people and minorities, let alone accurately capturing those who are most disengaged from the political system. Melissa Morales \u2014 founder and president of Somos Votantes and Somos PAC, groups that mobilize Latino voters \u2014 said that in their outreach campaigns this year, they are not seeing the tilt toward Trump among low-frequency voters evident in these multiple polls. In their work during 2022, she said,\u00a0\u201cWe were hearing it in the field, with low propensity Latino voters, they were open to Trump, especially [over] the economy.\u201d But, she added, \u201cWe are not hearing that in the field right now\u201d and instead \u201cwhat we are hearing is deep concern about the cost of living, rising costs, and a strong desire to know what the path forward is.\u201d Even with all these cautions, there are strong reasons to believe that Trump may benefit more from a very large overall turnout this year than Biden would. That conclusion is consistent with the other unusual demographic patterns evident in the 2024 election. So far, in almost all polls, Biden is holding a higher share of his 2020 vote among White than non-White voters; he\u2019s also maintaining more of his 2020 level of support with seniors than with young people. Among Whites, Biden, as in 2020, is running much better with those who hold at least a four-year college degree than those who don\u2019t. Biden\u2019s relative strength among seniors and college-educated White voters means that he\u2019s drawing from two of the most reliable voting blocs in the electorate. In 2020, about 75% of people older than 65 voted, compared to just 54% of young people aged 18-29, according to calculations from Census data by William Frey, a demographer at Brookings Metro. (Even that was a big increase in turnout among young people from the 2012 and 2016 elections.) Far more White voters with degrees turned out than those without them as well. Turnout was especially modest among the Black and Latino voters who have shown the most receptivity to Trump \u2014 men without a college degree. Only slightly less than half of them voted in 2020, Frey found. Most experts who study turnout consider it unlikely that as many people will vote this year as in 2020, largely because so many voters hold negative views about both Biden and Trump. After a record 160 million people voted in 2020, Bonier said his preliminary calculation is that turnout in 2024 is more likely to reach between 145-150 million with the possibility that as few as 140 million people will vote. Jeremy Smith, CEO of Civitech, a Democratic voter data and targeting firm, said that the number of people registered to even potentially vote is way down from the total at this point in the 2020 cycle. \u201cGenerally, if you said there are two possible electorates \u2014 one is 140 million people voting and one is 160 million people \u2014 the high likelihood is that the 140 would be better for Biden,\u201d said Bonier, a senior adviser and former CEO of TargetSmart, a leading Democratic targeting firm. If turnout shrinks from 2020, the key question for the two sides will be which voters fall away \u2014 and how many new voters enter the electorate to replace them. Generally, Democrats believe that in the Trump era the party benefits when the most habitual voters comprise a larger share of the electorate. Many Democrats believe that a key reason the party exceeded expectations in the 2022 midterm is that the electorate tilted more than anticipated toward these regular voters. The Democratic polling firm Equis Research, which focuses on Latino voters, for instance, found in its post-election analysis that Democrats performed slightly better than expected with that group largely because irregular Latino voters, who were more receptive to Trump, failed to come out. Michael Madrid, a long-time GOP strategist who has become a fierce Trump critic, said that the disappointing 2022 results for Republicans showed the risk for the party in the turnout patterns that the former president has triggered. Republicans under Trump, Madrid argued, are gaining support among non-White men, particularly Latinos, while shedding support among college-educated White voters, especially women. The danger for the GOP, Madrid said, is that the latter group turns out at a far higher rate than the former (as Frey\u2019s data shows). Given that disparity, Madrid argued, Trump \u201cneeds a high turnout\u201d that pulls in less reliable minority voters, especially Latino men. Trump\u2019s conundrum, Madrid said, is that the belligerent rule-breaking persona that attracts those younger non-White men alienates more of the well-educated White women already trending away from him. \u201cHe is talking to a single young male between video games: He\u2019s got them, they love him,\u201d Madrid said. \u201cBut there are suburban women that you lose by that, who hate that. That\u2019s his dilemma. He gets the turnout, but he also gets the turnoff.\u201d The best-case scenario for Trump is that an unusually large number of these irregularly voting working-class minorities come out to vote for him. Given his success in the past two elections at turning out irregularly voting working-class Whites, no one discounts his chances of turning out irregularly voting working-class non-Whites this time. But it\u2019s hardly guaranteed: Though these voters tend to be strongly discontented with the economy, Democrats believe they can loosen Trump\u2019s hold on them by highlighting his views on other issues, such as his pledges to implement a mass deportation effort against undocumented migrants, or to pardon White supremacists convicted in the January 6, 2021, insurrection. And as Podhorzer argued, unhappiness with the economy historically has not proven to be a powerful force in motivating irregular voters to show up. But Republicans point out that even if Trump doesn\u2019t win as many of these irregularly voting non-White men as polls show today, he will still benefit if they drift toward third-party candidates or simply choose not to vote. Looking at the Black community, \u201ceven if you don\u2019t buy the potential for Trump to flip lots of votes there, it seems there\u2019s considerable risk of a turnout drop-off that will hit Biden\u2019s raw margins out of big cities in the battlegrounds that Democrats usually depend on,\u201d said GOP pollster Patrick Ruffini. For that reason, many voter mobilization experts say Democrats can\u2019t give up on infrequent voters showing receptivity to Trump. Podhorzer pointed out that Democrats can still benefit from high turnout if the campaign\u2019s final weeks focus on the aspects of Trump\u2019s agenda that most alienate the irregular voters who surged to the polls against him in 2020. Morales said the number of low-frequency Latino voters that Somos PAC turned out in Nevada in 2022 exceeded Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto\u2019s margin of victory there, and the group remains committed to reaching those same voters for Biden. \u201cNot only can we get them out to vote, but when we have a conversation about the contrast and what their votes mean on the issues, we can win those voters over,\u201d Morales said. All of these dynamics may prove most volatile with younger voters. Through the 21st century, as first Millennials and now Generation Z have entered the electorate in large numbers, Democrats have unwaveringly operated on the belief that turning out as many young voters as possible would benefit the party. But that\u2019s a much more uncertain proposition in 2024, as demonstrated by the latest youth poll from the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics, probably the most in-depth look at attitudes among young people. In the IOP poll this spring, Biden led Trump by nearly 20 points among young adults (aged 18-29) who said they definitely plan to vote in November; that lead was comparable to Biden\u2019s advantage among all young adults in 2020. But Trump\u2019s position steadily improved as the likelihood of voting diminished, with the former president leading Biden by 2-to-1 among those who said they probably would not vote. Those who indicated they were less likely to vote tended to be young people without a college degree, non-Whites and the very youngest cohort aged 18-24. John Della Volpe, the Institute of Politics\u2019 polling director, pointed out that those youngest adults probably don\u2019t remember much about Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cYounger voters today have a different view of Trump,\u201d said Della Volpe, who advised the Biden campaign in 2020 on young voters. \u201cThey were 10, 12, 13 years old when he descended down that escalator, when he blocked Muslims, when he pulled out of Paris [the international climate treaty], when he talked about Charlottesville. They were children. Their values don\u2019t align with his values, but there is less toxicity when you bring up his name. So there is this openness that wasn\u2019t there in the last two elections.\u201d Even as recently as 2020, Della Volpe said, Democrats could target young people with what politicians in the old big-city machines used to call a \u201cblind pull\u201d \u2014 where a party can focus on turning out everyone in a particular neighborhood because such a high percentage of them will reliably vote for them. This year, he said, with young voters, \u201cit\u2019s definitely more complicated. It\u2019s not a blind pull.\u201d Della Volpe\u2019s observation underscores how Trump\u2019s strength among irregular voters could force Democrats to reconsider their tactics. Much of the voter registration and turnout work aimed at minority and young voters has historically operated through liberal non-profit organizations that target the broad population in those groups on the assumption that most of them will ultimately favor Democrats. But this year, some Democratic strategists worry that casting such a wide net could inadvertently mobilize an unusually large number of peripheral voters who favor Trump. That could compel Democrats to switch more of their registration and turnout efforts toward explicitly partisan programs, which can target voters more precisely based on their partisanship, but which are more difficult to raise money for. \u201cYou are hearing more groups struggling because their thesis has been \u2018I take [non-profit] dollars to get, say, all non-White voters\u2019\u201d to register and turnout, said Smith of Civitech. For Republicans, the mirror image imperative is finding ways to organize the irregular Black and Latino voters showing openness to\u00a0Trump. Republicans don\u2019t have much history of courting those voters, and, ironically, any effort to do so may be impeded by the barriers to voting that many Republican-controlled states have erected since 2020. Republicans also face the complication that Trump\u2019s diversion of large amounts of his fundraising toward his legal defense may mean there\u2019s less money available to invest in on-the-ground campaign operations. That may not matter much if the combination of Trump\u2019s ubiquitous media presence and discontent with Biden\u2019s record encourages enough irregular voters open to the former president to turn out in November. Based on the results in 2018, 2020 and 2022, Democrats can feel confident that at least as many habitual voters are hostile to Trump as committed to him, particularly in most of the battleground states that will decide the election. The decisive variable for 2024 may be how many people beyond that inner core of the most reliable voters show up and whether they break for the former president as decisively as most polls now suggest.

{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_haley-voters-pennsylvania-trump", "text": "Joan London is carrying a 40-year-old newspaper, its edges frayed and turning yellow. She beams as she unfolds it to show a black and white photograph of her earliest political activism \u2014 holding a 1984 Reagan-Bush campaign sign. On her phone, more GOP pride: photos of London at a rally for a Republican candidate for Pennsylvania governor and in Washington, DC, for a Tea Party event during the Obama presidency. \u201cWhen I was 18, I registered as a Republican,\u201d London said. \u201cI\u2019ve been a Republican for many years until a month ago when I changed by registration from Republican to Independent.\u201d Just before the switch, one last ballot cast as a Republican: a vote for Nikki Haley in Pennsylvania\u2019s April presidential primary, even though the former South Carolina governor had bowed out of the race seven weeks earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s time to pass the baton to a new generation in the Republican Party, and I felt that she was it,\u201d London told CNN in an interview. She cast her Haley protest vote, then left Donald Trump\u2019s GOP. \u201cI have a different vision of what conservatism is,\u201d London said. \u201cI came up in the 80s under (Ronald) Reagan. I\u2019ve always had a very positive vision of self-sufficiency and personal responsibility. \u2026 I\u2019m seeing a change more toward populism which carries some unpleasant baggage, which I didn\u2019t see myself as part of. Didn\u2019t see it reflecting my values.\u201d London is hardly alone. Haley garnered nearly 17% of the primary vote statewide this year \u2014 approaching 25% in the suburban collar counties around Philadelphia. More than 155,000 votes in all \u2014 a potentially decisive bloc in a presidential battleground that Trump carried by 44,292 votes in 2016 and Joe Biden won by 81,660 in 2020. Our conversation with London is part of a CNN project designed to follow the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in the battleground states and are critical to deciding the outcome. London is an attorney in Berks County. The shift as you drive northwest from the Philly suburbs is unmistakable. First the farms and silos, then the Trump flags. He carried Berks County by 10 points in 2016 and 8 points in 2020. But even here, Haley received nearly 16% in the primary \u2014 votes Trump can ill afford to lose come November. London\u2019s is all but certainly lost. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself voting for Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself voting for Biden.\u201d For now, her plan is to either skip the presidential line on the ballot or write in a conservative. She knows the math: any subtraction hurts Trump. \u201cI believe we have to send a message that the Republican Party needs to go in a different direction,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a principled position I need to take.\u201d Irma Fralic, too, cast her primary vote for Haley as a protest. \u201cI want a country that is normal,\u201d Fralic said. \u201cI want a country that functions and I want people to be together.\u201d She is the daughter of Cuban immigrants, a staunch supporter of Israel and a Reagan Republican who saw Haley as tough and principled on foreign policy. Now? \u201cI\u2019m not happy with the options, no,\u201d Fralic said. \u201cOne is in court. And the other one is \u2013 I feel bad for him. If he was my father, I\u2019d say, \u2018You might want to reconsider your life.\u2019 I don\u2019t know. And the other one, I would say, \u2018You might want to prioritize your personal problems.\u2019\u201d Our visit to Pennsylvania coincided with Haley announcing she will vote for Trump in November despite significant differences with the presumptive GOP nominee. Haley also said in her announcement last week she wished Trump would make a direct effort to court her supporters. Fralic said Haley\u2019s decision to vote for Trump would not automatically sway her. But she offered this: \u201cThe best way for Trump to reach out to me and the millions who voted for Nikki Haley is to choose her as VP. If that\u2019s the ticket, they have my vote.\u201d London was more muted in her response. \u201cMy respect for Ambassador Haley has not changed whether or not I agree with her choice,\u201d London said in a text exchange. Eyeing Trump, but holding her nose Linda Rooney cast her Haley vote in the primary as a question as much as a protest. \u201cWho are the people in the Republican Party that keep shoving this down our throats right now?\u201d Rooney said. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we elect someone normal? You know, someone who is diplomatic.\u201d Rooney is a registered Republican who voted Trump in 2016 then Biden in 2020. But she has ruled out voting for Biden again. \u201cI don\u2019t trust him with the economy,\u201d said Rooney, who runs a digital communications business from her home in Media, in suburban Delaware County. Rooney\u2019s son serves in the Army. \u201cI\u2019m angry about Afghanistan, about that withdrawal. So, honestly, I can\u2019t vote for him.\u201d Rooney framed her 2024 debate this way: \u201cI can write someone in, or I can just hold my nose and vote for Trump and know that\u2019s only going to be four more years.\u201d Later, in a text exchange, Rooney said, \u201cHaley would be a good VP and possibly keep him in check.\u201d\u00a0Her reaction to the former governor saying she\u2019d vote for Trump was perhaps revealing of where Rooney will end up. \u201cI think Haley is in the same boat as the rest of us who don\u2019t want Trump as our nominee,\u201d Rooney texted. \u201cShe\u2019s just holding her nose earlier than the rest of us.\u201d That Rooney would even consider Trump speaks volumes about her disappointment in Biden. She called Trump\u2019s conduct on January 6, 2021, appalling. \u201cI was angry that Trump didn\u2019t say something,\u201d she said. \u201cThat Trump didn\u2019t stop it. \u2026 So, you know, I just can\u2019t forgive him for that.\u201d She also works as a borough elections monitor and rolled her eyes when told that Trump again recently insisted he won Pennsylvania in 2020. \u201cNo,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cNo.\u201d A veteran who wants anyone but Trump Michael Pesce lives in Bucks County and works in a meat processing plant. He has been a registered Republican for 40 years. \u201cMy first election, presidential election, was 1984,\u201d Pesce said in an interview at his Doylestown home. \u201cI became a Republican when I turned 18 because of Ronald Reagan.\u201d His parents were Democrats. \u201cAt the time, they were, like, \u2018We\u2019re Democrats. We\u2019re not Republicans.\u2019 I was like, \u2018No, no, no, I\u2019m a Reagan Republican.\u201d Pesce is a Coast Guard veteran who voted Trump in 2016 but Biden in 2020. This year? \u201cIf I had my choice, I wouldn\u2019t vote for either,\u201d said Pesce, who backed Haley in the April primary. \u201cBut I will vote for Biden. I will vote for anyone but Trump.\u201d Why? \u201cSo, he tried to overthrow our government, and that\u2019s a problem with me,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cServed in the US military. I just have very strong feelings about what it means to be an American.\u201d Pesce has little patience for those who believe Trump can do no wrong. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear that, Ok, he could be a convicted criminal in a couple of days,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear that he did all these things.\u201d Pesce said he was \u201cgreatly disappointed\u201d to hear of Haley\u2019s decision to support Trump. \u201cI think she is looking ahead four years,\u201d he said. But it won\u2019t sway him. \u201cI\u2019m a Republican. I\u2019m a conservative,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cI think we spend a lot of money on stuff we don\u2019t need to spend money on.\u201d Yet he will vote Biden and hopes many others among the more than 150,000 Pennsylvania Republicans who cast votes for Haley in the primary will do the same. \u201cIf enough of us Republicans can do the right thing, keep Trump out of office, the next four years aren\u2019t going to be perfect,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cBut I think they are going to be better than the alternative.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/politics/haley-voters-pennsylvania-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_elections-uk-mexico-what-matters", "text": "A large portion of Americans think the US government needs major, systemic reform \u2014 at least according to some polling \u2014 so it\u2019s worth looking at how other countries are doing things. Where are elections not never-ending? Anyone struggling to maintain interest in the never-ending, yearslong focus on the American presidential election might look with envy at the United Kingdom. Voters there only learned Wednesday they\u2019ll have an election in July, when rain-soaked Prime Minister Rishi Sunak gambled by announcing a snap general election for July 4. No months of primaries. No party conventions. Everyone knew something was coming \u2014 Sunak\u2019s Conservative Party had until next January to call the election, and it seems like an excessive period since the last UK-wide election in December 2019 \u2014 but clearly the campaign portion will be truncated. Sunak and his party have six weeks to make up a steep deficit in the polls or at least hope to block an outright majority for the Labour Party. RELATED: 7 questions you might have about the UK\u2019s snap July general election British voters won\u2019t directly pick a prime minister. Instead, they\u2019ll select members of Parliament. The leader of the party that wins a majority automatically becomes prime minister, and he or she assembles a government around them. It would be as if US House Speaker Mike Johnson appointed fellow lawmakers to run portions of the federal government. It can be a messy system, such as when the ruling Conservative Party churned through a series of prime ministers in recent years without having to get any input from voters. In contrast, India, which is the world\u2019s largest democracy and which, like the UK, has a parliamentary system of government, conducts its election over the course of many weeks. Results will be announced on June 4. CNN\u2019s Will Ripley was recently out on the campaign trail with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is vying for a third consecutive term. Modi\u2019s international reputation has morphed in those years from that of a reformer to that of a divisive nationalist, vilifying the country\u2019s Muslims in his bid to keep power. Where are they choosing between 2 younger women instead of 2 old men? Anyone struggling to find inspiration in the rematch of two senior citizens vying for the US presidency might look with some envy at Mexico, where the government bears many similarities to the US but where the president can only serve a single six-year term. That means Mexico President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador must step aside despite his relative popularity \u2014 and, at 70, youth \u2014 compared with the US options, President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. Instead of choosing between two older men, when Mexican voters go to the polls on June 2, they will be choosing between two younger women. L\u00f3pez Obrador endorsed the front-runner, Claudia Sheinbaum, the candidate from his Morena Party who previously led the Mexico City government. The candidate for an opposition coalition is Xochitl G\u00e1lvez, a former Mexican senator. Both are 61. There are other candidates, although they have little chance of winning. Tragedy struck the campaign trail Wednesday when a stage collapsed due to heavy winds, killing nine people. It\u2019s a direct election \u2014 no Electoral College \u2014 and the person who gets the most votes wins. Where do judges not have lifetime appointments? Another difference in Mexico is that Supreme Court justices serve a 15-year term instead of the justice-for-life tradition in the US. If the US had term limits, Samuel Alito would be three years off the bench and free to fly whatever flag he wanted at any of his homes. Instead, with no term limits and no binding ethics rules for US Supreme Court justices, there\u2019s nothing to keep Alito from joining opinions related to November\u2019s election. That\u2019s despite the fact that the flags outside his homes suggest he might have some preferences. Does an upside-down flag flown outside his home in Virginia days before \ufeffBiden\u2019s inauguration betray a bias? Does the flying of a flag seen at the January 6, 2021, \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally suggest a friendliness to Christian nationalists? There\u2019s arguably more evidence of a preference in the activism of fellow justice Clarence Thomas\u2019 wife, Ginni. Thomas, who was appointed to the bench in 1991 by then-President George H.W. Bush, is more than 30 years into his Supreme Court tenure. Both Thomas and Alito, in their 70s, are younger than both of the men most primary voters for the major political parties have selected to run for president. Where do they overhaul their court systems? If the nature of the US Supreme Court seems immutable and unchangeable, it\u2019s not. There\u2019s no political will to change the system, but that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t happen. Congress could, in theory, impose term limits on justices. It could also change the number of justices on the court, as it has in the past. There are active campaigns to change the US system, including changing the number of justices and imposing 18-year term limits. But these do not currently have major political momentum. Plus, Republicans rightly feel they will enjoy an advantage with the current system for decades to come. It\u2019s unlikely they would buy into an overhaul. The UK actually overhauled its Supreme Court with a Constitutional Reform Act back in 2005, although a major difference between the UK and the US is that the UK does not technically have a written constitution. There are plenty of cautionary tales out there as well about other forms of government. In Russia and China, where free speech and the press are seriously limited, autocratic leaders have instilled themselves and are looking to widen their worldwide influence. El Salvador had a ban on its president serving two consecutive terms, but a court full of appointees by controversial President Nayib Bukele gave him the power to seek and win reelection in February. That\u2019s not an option in the US, where the 22nd Amendment only allows for a person to serve two four-year presidential terms. Whoever wins in November \u2014 Biden or Trump \u2014 will be unable to run again.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/politics/elections-uk-mexico-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_republicans-2024-election-analysis", "text": "Top Republicans are already rushing to buy into a new 2024 election fraud narrative sown by ex-President Donald Trump in their zeal to appease their party\u2019s presumptive nominee. Leading\u00a0party figures are increasingly warning they will only recognize the result of November\u2019s presidential vote if there is no fraud. But there is no indication that there will be irregularities in the election. And their warnings come despite many Republican state legislatures taking steps to tighten voting rules \u2014 based on Trump\u2019s lies about fraud in 2020. The new Republican trend of casting doubt on the integrity of the 2024 election in advance was exhibited by Sen. Ted Cruz on Wednesday in an interview with CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins. The Texas lawmaker, who in 2016\u00a0fell in\u00a0line behind Trump despite the ex-president\u2019s insults about his father and his wife, falsely stated that the 2020 election was tainted by fraud. Despite Trump\u2019s claims of voting irregularities, multiple courts, including the US Supreme Court, rejected the former president\u2019s claims he was cheated out of power. And Trump\u2019s then-attorney general, William Barr, looked into his claims and decided that there was no widespread fraud that would have changed the result of the election. But Cruz told Collins that a question about whether he would accept the results of the 2024 election was \u201cridiculous.\u201d \u201cSo you\u2019re asking, \u2018Will you promise, no matter what, to agree an election is legitimate regardless of what happens?,\u2019 and that would be an absurd thing to claim,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cWe have an entire election law system: that people challenge elections, elections get overturned, voter fraud gets proven. That happens all the time.\u201d Cruz, who objected to election results in Arizona, which Trump narrowly lost to Biden, on January 6, 2021, went on to suggest there was significant fraud in 2020. And he implied the same could happen this year. \u201cIf the Democrats win, I will accept the result, but I\u2019m not going to ignore fraud regardless of what happens,\u201d Cruz said. A sign of Trump\u2019s power The equivocating of senior Republicans appears motivated by a fear of crossing Trump, the twice-impeached GOP leader who has the power to end careers in the party simply by turning against an individual lawmaker. The positioning looks a lot like laying the groundwork for a challenge to the fairness of the 2024 election if Trump loses in November. Undermining an election even before it happens represents a grave threat to democracy. The attempt to raise the specter of election fraud this year is especially corrosive because of the likelihood that the 2024 vote will be decided in a handful of swing states by mere thousands of ballots and raises the possibility of prolonged legal action by Trump\u2019s camp that would tarnish yet another US election. Trump is still claiming falsely that Mike Pence had the constitutional authority power to overturn the 2020 election result, and the former vice president has been largely ostracized within his party for following the Constitution and overseeing the certification of Biden\u2019s victory. Cruz is just one of the latest senior party figures to try to avoid getting on the wrong side of Trump when asked whether they will accept the result of the 2024 election. The attempt to win Trump\u2019s favor follows an interview that Trump gave to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel newspaper earlier this month. \u201cIf everything\u2019s honest, I\u2019ll gladly accept the results. I don\u2019t change on that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf it\u2019s not, you have to fight for the right of the country.\u201d His comments carried the implicit threat that he will decide if he loses, as he did in 2020, that the election was not fair. Trump frequently claims he did better in the popular vote four years ago than any incumbent president, creating a false argument that it was therefore impossible to lose to Biden, who got more votes. Trump\u2019s renewed election denialism is disturbing for several reasons. First, it mirrors his pre-election spin in 2020, when he suggested that the election might not be fair \u2014 which he later built upon after losing to Biden with a widespread campaign that culminated in the mob attack by his supporters on the Capitol\u00a0that was\u00a0designed to thwart the certification of Biden\u2019s victory. Trump often leaves the impression that any election he loses cannot, by definition, be legitimate. His false claims about election fraud in 2020 are now believed by millions of Republican voters despite the fact that he has been indicted twice \u2014 in a federal case and in Georgia \u2014 for his attempts to steal the election and stay in power. Comments like Cruz\u2019s on Wednesday serve to create an expectation among some voters that the coming election will not be fair, even though there is no indication that this, or any other US election, will be tarnished by fraud,\u00a0which historically has only taken place at very low levels. Republican senators try to demonstrate loyalty to Trump The Texas senator is far from the only senior party figure to buy into Trump\u2019s claims,\u00a0a trend that shows the sheer power of Trump in the GOP. It also follows the announcement by former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley on Wednesday that she will vote for Trump despite having called him \u201cunhinged\u201d and unfit to serve in the Oval Office again during her primary campaign earlier this year. Her move appeared to be an attempt to retain viability in the Republican Party for any future run for president. It seems like it should be easy for Republicans just to state that they will accept the result of the 2024 election and that US presidential votes in the modern era have not been tainted by fraud. But they can\u2019t seem to do it. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, whom Trump mentioned as a possible vice presidential contender on Thursday, said on CNN the same night, \u201cI will accept the results if it\u2019s done in a fair and transparent way,\u201d going on to raise doubts about mail-in voting. Also on CNN Thursday night, Florida Rep. Byron Donalds \u2014 who\u2019s also been mentioned as a possible Trump running mate \u2014 was asked if he\u2019d accept the results if Trump loses. \u201cIf the states and localities actually follow the rules and procedures and everybody sees the rules followed, then of course, you accept what\u2019s done,\u201d Donalds said. Earlier this week, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who ran against Trump in 2016 but has since adopted Trumpian positions, was asked Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d whether he would accept the result of the election \u201cno matter what happens.\u201d He replied: \u201cIf it\u2019s an unfair election, I think it\u2019s going to be contested by either side.\u201d He claimed that Democrats have \u201copposed every Republican victory since 2000\u201d and added: \u201cIf it\u2019s unfair, we are going to do the same thing Democrats do \u2026 we\u2019re going to use lawyers to go to court and point out the fact that states are not following their own election laws.\u201d Rubio\u2019s comment is misleading because, while there were some claims by small groups of Democrats that the elections of 2004 and 2016 featured some fraud, the Democratic candidates in each case quickly conceded to Republicans,\u00a0unlike Trump, who has never accepted that he lost. The 2000 election was contested by Republicans and Democrats over a recount controversy in Florida, the pivotal state. The Democratic candidate,\u00a0then-Vice President\u00a0Al Gore, eventually conceded after the case was adjudicated by the Supreme Court \u2014 a step that Trump never took as he sought to disrupt the American tradition of peaceful transfers of power. The idea that the 2024 election may not be free and fair was also raised recently by Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance,\u00a0who is reported to be on Trump\u2019s shortlist as a potential vice presidential nominee. He told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union\u201d earlier this month that \u201cI totally plan to accept the results of 2024,\u201d while holding out the possibility that the election may not be fair if Trump were to lose. \u201cI think that Donald Trump will be (the victor).\u00a0And if it\u2019s a free and fair election, Dana, I think every Republican will enthusiastically accept the results. And, again, I think those results will show that Donald Trump has been elected president, been reelected president.\u201d Vance argued that parties in the election had to be willing to prosecute their cases if they believed there was election fraud. But academic studies and multiple legal cases have shown that fraud in presidential elections only occurs in isolated cases. That\u2019s not stopping Republicans demonstrating their loyalty to Trump by casting doubt on the integrity of the 2024 election before it even happens.

{"id": "2024_05_28_politics_us-gaza-pier-broken-apart", "text": "The temporary pier\u00a0constructed by the US military\u00a0to transport aid\u00a0into Gaza\u00a0broke apart and sustained damage in heavy seas\u00a0on Tuesday in a major blow to the American-led effort to create a maritime corridor for humanitarian supplies into the war-torn enclave, the Pentagon said. The pier was \u201cdamaged and sections of the pier need rebuilding and repairing,\u201d\u00a0Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said on Tuesday. The pier will be removed from its location on the Gaza coast over the next 48 hours and taken to the Israeli port of Ashdod, where US Central Command will carry out repairs, Singh said. The repairs will take more than a week, further delaying the effort to get the maritime corridor fully operating. Earlier, four US officials told CNN the pier broke apart in heavy seas. Part of the\u00a0pier, which consists of a narrow causeway to drive aid into Gaza and a wider parking area to drop off supplies\u00a0transported by ship, disconnected on Sunday, the officials said. The parking area will have to be reconnected to the causeway before\u00a0the\u00a0pier can be used again. The damage, first reported by NBC News, occurred three days after heavy seas forced two small US Army vessels to beach in Israel, according to US Central Command, while another two vessels broke free of their moorings and were anchored near the pier. US troops who were aboard the beached vessels were evacuated on Saturday, Singh said on Wednesday, correcting her assertion on Tuesday that the soldiers were still aboard the vessels. \u201c[O]n May 25, heavy sea states caused four US Army vessels operating in support of the JLOTS pier operations to become beached. Two vessels were beached in Gaza near the base of the pier and two were beached near Ashkelon in Israel,\u201d Singh said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cUS personnel on those vessels were evacuated on Saturday, May 25.\u201d The\u00a0pier,\u00a0which cost\u00a0$320 million,\u00a0had only begun operating on May 17 when heavy seas forced the maritime shipments to stop\u00a0one week later on May\u00a024,\u00a0two days before part of the pier disconnected.\u00a0It is unclear when shipments will resume. The temporary pier, called the Joint Logistics Over the Shore (JLOTS), requires very good sea\u00a0conditions\u00a0to operate. CNN reported previously that JLOTS can only be operated safely in a maximum of 3-foot waves and winds less than approximately 15 miles per hour. Heavier sea\u00a0conditions\u00a0delayed the deployment of the\u00a0pier\u00a0for several weeks, as the system sat docked in the Israeli port of Ashdod waiting for favorable conditions. The US has stressed that the temporary pier is only meant to augment humanitarian shipments going through the land crossings between Israel and Gaza. On Thursday, Vice Adm.\u00a0Brad Cooper,\u00a0deputy\u00a0commander of US Central Command, said 820 metric\u00a0tons\u00a0of aid had been delivered through the pier to the Gaza beach, where the United Nations was responsible for distributing it to the Palestinian population. The Pentagon said Thursday that more than 1,000 metric tons of aid had been delivered before the temporary pier had to halt operations. Daniel Dieckhaus, the director of USAID\u2019s Levant Response Management Team, told reporters Thursday that there were \u201cthousands and thousands of\u00a0tons\u201d of aid waiting in Cyprus to be delivered through the maritime corridor. But those shipments are now paused with the temporary pier inoperable. CNN\u2019s Paul Murphy contributed reporting. This story has been updated with additional details.
