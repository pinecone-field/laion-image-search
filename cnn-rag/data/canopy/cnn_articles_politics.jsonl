{"id": "2024_06_03_politics_bob-menendez-new-jersey-senate-independent", "text": "Indicted Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey filed for reelection Monday as an independent. His decision to file as an independent, first reported by The New Jersey Globe, comes the day before a New Jersey primary in which three Democrats and four Republicans are vying for their parties\u2019 nominations for the seat he currently holds. Menendez, who is facing federal corruption charges and is on trial in New York City, had announced in March that he would not run for a fourth full term as a Democrat, but left open the possibility of an independent bid if exonerated. He faces a Tuesday deadline to file as an independent. New Jersey\u2019s deadline for independent candidates to withdraw from the ballot is August 16. His presence in the race could make the Senate contest in New Jersey more unpredictable, with control of the chamber hanging in the balance. Democrats hold a narrow majority but face a difficult election map this fall. \u201cIt displeases me to have to go this route, thanks to overzealous prosecutors, but I will do what must be done\u00a0to continue to uphold my oath of office for my constituents,\u201d Menendez\u00a0said in a statement Monday evening. \u201cAs I have said before; I have committed no crime. I am more confident than ever that New Jerseyans and the rest of the American public will see me exonerated of what I am being accused of, and I will be re-elected to the Senate once again,\u201d he continued. Rep. Andy Kim, the Democratic front-runner in Tuesday\u2019s primary, criticized what he said were Menendez\u2019s self-interested motives. \u201cAmericans are fed up with politicians putting their own personal benefit ahead of what\u2019s right for the country,\u201d Kim said in a statement. \u201cEveryone knows Bob Menendez isn\u2019t running for the people of New Jersey, he\u2019s doing it for himself. It\u2019s beyond time for change and I\u2019m stepping up to restore integrity back into the U.S. Senate.\u201d Menendez\u2019s federal corruption trial is in its fourth week. The senator, New Jersey businessmen Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, and Menendez\u2019s wife, Nadine, are accused of engaging in a bribery scheme and acting as foreign agents for the Egyptian government. All four have pleaded not guilty. The trial has featured hundreds of text messages, emails, images and voicemails sent between the senator, Nadine Menendez, Hana and an array of friends and business associates with alleged roles in the bribery scheme.

{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_fact-check-trump-post-conviction-speech", "text": "Former President Donald Trump said he was going to hold a \u201cpress conference\u201d on Friday in the wake of his Thursday conviction in Manhattan on felony charges of falsifying business records. Instead, Trump delivered a rambling monologue that was filled with false claims on subjects ranging from the Manhattan trial to immigration to tax policy. Here is a fact check of some of the inaccurate or unsubstantiated claims he made. Crime in New York City Trump repeated his familiar claim that, while Manhattan prosecutors have been focusing on him, New York City has been experiencing record-high violent crime. He said this time that \u201cyou have violent crime all over this city at levels that nobody\u2019s ever seen before.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim is not even close to true. Violent crime in New York City \u2013 and violent crime in Manhattan in particular \u2013 has plummeted since the early 1990s and is today nowhere near record levels. New York City recorded 391 murders in 2023, down about 83% from the 2,262 in 1990; 1,455 rapes in 2023, down about 53% from the 3,126 in 1990; and 16,910 robberies in 2023, down about 83% from the 100,280 in 1990. Michael Cohen\u2019s crimes Criticizing key prosecution witness Michael Cohen, Trump repeated a claim he made during the trial in April. He asserted that Cohen, his former lawyer and fixer, \u201cgot into trouble not because of me\u201d but because of \u201coutside deals\u201d and \u201csomething to do with taxicabs and medallions, and he borrowed money, and that\u2019s why he went.\u201d He added that Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations to try to get himself a lighter penalty. Trump continued: \u201cHe got in trouble for a very simple reason: because he was involved with borrowing a lot of money and he did something with the banks \u2013 I don\u2019t know, defrauded the banks, but something happened.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim that Cohen got into trouble simply because of his non-Trump-related activities, such as those related to taxis and loans, is not true. First, Cohen\u2019s case was referred to federal prosecutors in New York by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, who was appointed to investigate any connections between the Trump campaign and Russia. Second, Cohen\u2019s three-year prison sentence in 2018 was for\u00a0multiple\u00a0crimes, some of which were directly related to Trump.\u00a0 Most notably, Cohen was sentenced for\u00a0campaign finance offenses\u00a0connected to a hush money scheme\u00a0during the 2016 presidential campaign to conceal Trump\u2019s alleged extramarital relationships \u2013 the same hush money scheme that was central to this prosecution against Trump. Cohen was\u00a0also sentenced to two months in prison, to run concurrently with the three-year sentence, for\u00a0lying to Congress in 2017 in relation to previous talks about the possibility of building a Trump Tower in Moscow, Russia, including about the\u00a0extent of Trump\u2019s involvement in the aborted Moscow initiative\u00a0and about when in 2016 the discussions ended.\u00a0(The discussions continued into June 2016, the month after Trump\u00a0became the presumptive Republican nominee, and did not conclude in January 2016 before the first votes were cast, as Cohen had claimed.) Referring to Trump as \u201cIndividual-1,\u201d Cohen\u00a0said\u00a0at the time of his 2018 guilty plea for making false statements to the US\u00a0Senate Select Committee on Intelligence: \u201cI made these statements to be consistent with Individual-1\u2019s political messaging and out of loyalty to Individual-1.\u201d When Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to the campaign finance violations, he\u00a0said\u00a0he broke the law \u201cin coordination and at the direction of a candidate for federal office,\u201d\u00a0Trump. Biden and the case Trump repeated his frequent claim that the Manhattan case in which Trump was convicted \u201cis all done by Biden and his people\u201d and \u201cin total conjunction with white house and the DOJ,\u201d the federal Department of Justice. Facts First:\u00a0There is no basis for Trump\u2019s claim. There is no evidence that President Joe Biden, his White House aides or the federal Justice Department had any role in launching or running Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s prosecution\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and Bragg, a Democrat, is a locally elected official who does not report to the federal government. The\u00a0indictment\u00a0in the case was approved by a grand jury of ordinary citizens. Trump has\u00a0repeatedly invoked\u00a0a lawyer on Bragg\u2019s team, Matthew Colangelo, while making such claims; Colangelo left the Justice Department in 2022\u00a0to join the district attorney\u2019s office\u00a0as\u00a0senior counsel to Bragg. But there is no evidence that Biden had anything to do with Colangelo\u2019s employment decision. Colangelo and Bragg had been colleagues before Bragg was elected Manhattan district attorney in 2021. Before Colangelo worked at the Justice Department, he and Bragg worked at the same time in the office of New York\u2019s state attorney general, where Colangelo\u00a0investigated Trump\u2019s charity\u00a0and Trump\u2019s financial practices and was\u00a0involved in bringing various lawsuits\u00a0against the Trump administration. The judge and an expert in election law Trump claimed that, because of Judge Juan Merchan, \u201cwe weren\u2019t allowed to use our election expert under any circumstances.\u201d He claimed that this expert on election law was ready to testify \u201cand the judge knocked him out, said you can\u2019t testify.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim that Merchan refused to allow Trump\u2019s team to use this witness \u201cunder any circumstances\u201d is false. Merchan did not prohibit the potential witness, former\u00a0Federal Election Commission\u00a0chairman Bradley Smith, from testifying. Rather, Merchan\u00a0limited what Smith was allowed to testify about. Merchan\u00a0decided\u00a0in March that Smith could provide background information about the FEC and define certain terms relevant to this case but could not opine on whether Trump broke federal election laws or offer opinions about how to interpret or apply those laws. After Merchan\u00a0refused last week to change his mind, Trump\u2019s defense decided not to call Smith as a witness.\u00a0 Smith\u00a0wrote\u00a0on social media last week: \u201cJudge Merchan has so restricted my testimony that defense has decided not to call me.\u201d Trump, offering a hint of a clarification, did proceed to say on Friday that Smith \u201cessentially\u201d was not able to testify. But his earlier comments made it sound like Merchan had imposed a total ban on Smith\u2019s testimony. Immigration and \u2018the Congo\u2019 Trump repeated a claim he has made before about \u201cthe Congo\u201d and migration, again without specifying whether he was referring to the Democratic Republic of Congo or the neighboring Republic of Congo. He said: \u201cThe Congo has just released a lot of people from jail \u2013 Congo, Africa \u2013 just released a lot of people, a lot of people, from their prisons and jails, and brought them into the United States of America.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim is baseless. Experts on the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Republic of Congo, plus both pro-immigration and anti-immigration organizations in the US, told CNN they have not seen any evidence of Congolese prisons being emptied, let alone evidence of either country somehow having \u201cbrought\u201d ex-prisoners into the US. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and an allied super PAC did not respond to requests to provide any evidence. A CNN search of two media databases turned up no evidence. And federal figures show that there is no \u201cvery big\u201d influx of Congolese migrants of any kind, let alone former prisoners in particular. \u201cEverything he is saying isn\u2019t true,\u201d Democratic Republic of Congo spokesperson Patrick Muyaya Katembwe told CNN in a text message in March. Asked specifically about Trump\u2019s claims about Congolese prisons being emptied of violent criminals, he said, \u201cNever ever, it\u2019s not true.\u201d And, he said, \u201cwe want him to stop\u201d telling these stories, since \u201cit\u2019s very bad for the country.\u201d Serge Mombouli, the Republic of Congo\u2019s ambassador to the US, said in an email to CNN in March:\u00a0\u201cThere is no truth or any sign nor a single fact supporting such a claim or statement.\u201d You can read more\u00a0here. Trump and Nord Stream 2 Trump repeated his claim that he had ended a key Russian project \u2013 the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany. He said: \u201cYou know, I ended the Russian pipeline. It was dead.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim is false. He did not \u201cend\u201d Nord Stream nor render it \u201cdead.\u201d While he did\u00a0approve sanctions\u00a0on companies working on the project, that move came nearly three years into his presidency, when the pipeline was already\u00a0around 90% complete\u00a0\u2013 and the state-owned Russian gas company behind the project\u00a0said\u00a0shortly after the sanctions that it would complete the pipeline itself. The company\u00a0announced\u00a0in December 2020 that construction was resuming. And with days left in Trump\u2019s term in January 2021, Germany\u00a0announced\u00a0that it had renewed permission for construction in its waters. The pipeline never began operations; Germany ended up\u00a0halting the project\u00a0as Russia was about to invade Ukraine in early 2022. The pipeline was damaged later that year in what has been\u00a0described as a likely act of sabotage. Biden\u2019s tax policy Trump claimed while denouncing the Biden administration: \u201cThey want to raise your taxes by four times.\u201d Facts First: This is false, just as it was when Trump made the same claim during the 2020 election campaign and in early 2024. Biden has not proposed to quadruple Americans\u2019 taxes, and there has never been any indication that he is seeking to do so. The nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center think tank, which analyzed Biden\u2019s never-implemented budget proposals for fiscal 2024, found this: \u201cHis plan would raise average after-tax incomes for low-income households in 2024, leave them effectively unchanged for middle-income households, and lower after-tax incomes significantly for the highest-income taxpayers.\u201d The Tax Policy Center found that Biden\u2019s proposal would, on average, have raised taxes by about $2,300 \u2013 but that\u2019s about a 2.3% decline in after-tax income, not the massive reduction Trump is suggesting Biden wants. And critically, Tax Policy Center senior fellow Howard Gleckman noted to CNN on Friday that 95% of the tax hike would have been covered by the highest-income 5% of households. The very biggest burden under the Biden plan would have been carried by the very richest households; the Tax Policy Center found that households in the top 0.1% would have seen their after-tax incomes decline by more than 20%. That\u2019s \u201ca lot,\u201d Gleckman noted, but it\u2019s still nowhere near the quadrupling Trump claims Biden is looking for. And again, even this increase would have been only for a tiny subset of the population. Biden has promised not to raise taxes by even a cent for anyone making under $400,000 per year.

{"id": "2024_05_20_politics_hunter-biden-exes-addiction-gun-trial", "text": "Special counsel David Weiss plans to present extremely personal testimony about Hunter Biden\u2019s drug addiction from three of his former romantic partners, according to a new filing in the felony gun case against the president\u2019s son. In a filing Monday evening, prosecutors laid out their case against Hunter Biden, which is scheduled to go to trial on June 3 in Delaware. Prosecutors described some of their key witnesses\u00a0and\u00a0what they plan to say on the stand, and they also released text messages and photos that they plan to show to the jury. The president\u2019s son has pleaded not guilty to three crimes\u00a0in the gun case, all stemming from Weiss\u2019 claim that he was abusing drugs while he purchased and briefly possessed a revolver in 2018, which is against federal law. These revelations about Weiss\u2019 trial strategy and witness list underscore the extremely personal nature of this case, which will shine a national spotlight on what Hunter Biden has said was his rock bottom. Hunter Biden has been very open about\u00a0his\u00a0lifelong struggle\u00a0with alcohol and drug addiction. But to win a conviction, Weiss will need to bring that addiction to life for the jury, with compelling witnesses and photographic evidence, to prove in court that Hunter Biden was abusing drugs when he owned the gun. The expected prosecution witnesses include Hunter Biden\u2019s ex-wife Kathleen Buhle and\u00a0his late brother\u2019s widow, whom he later also dated,\u00a0Hallie Biden. The filings don\u2019t identify the women by name, but Weiss\u2019 description of their testimony matches other public details and court filings from related cases. Prosecutors say one witness,\u00a0who CNN has identified as Hallie Biden, will testify that Hunter Biden possessed the revolver in 2018 and that she took it from his car and threw it in a dumpster near a grocery store in Wilmington, Delaware. She would search \u201chis bags, backpacks, and vehicle in an effort to help him get sober, and discovered drug paraphernalia and drugs in his possessions on multiple occasions\u201d in 2018, prosecutors wrote. Prosecutors said in the filing that a third expected witness will testify that she \u201cobserved the defendant using crack cocaine frequently \u2014 every 20 minutes except when he slept.\u201d The filing from prosecutors also includes scores of text messages they say are from Hunter Biden, including images of drugs,\u00a0as well as\u00a0messages about sobriety and meeting with drug dealers. \u201cThe government intends to show videos and photographs of the defendant smoking crack, or of crack or drug paraphernalia in videos/photographs backed up to the defendant\u2019s Apple iCloud account or laptop, or sent in the defendant\u2019s messages,\u201d prosecutors wrote. Other witnesses prosecutors will call include federal agents and\u00a0the gun store\u00a0employee\u00a0who allegedly sold Hunter Biden the pistol in 2018. One Drug Enforcement Administration agent, prosecutors say, will discuss coded terms and drug language they say Hunter Biden used in text messages with others, \u201csuch as \u2018baby powder,\u2019 \u2018Party Favor,\u2019 \u201810grams,\u2019 (and) \u2018chore boy.\u2019\u201d CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misidentified a potential prosecution witness.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/politics/hunter-biden-exes-addiction-gun-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_politics_politicians-blaming-wives-what-matters", "text": "Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito doesn\u2019t deny there was an upside-down American flag flying outside his house days before Joe Biden was sworn in as president, an apparent distress signal that would seem to express sympathy with the plight of Donald Trump supporters who refused to believe their guy lost the 2020 election. But Alito did offer an excuse for the flag, which had become a symbol of the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d movement before and after the election. \u201cI had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag,\u201d Alito said in a written statement to The New York Times, which first reported the story. \u201cIt was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor\u2019s use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.\u201d So the wife did it to get back at the neighbors. Her first name is Martha-Ann, by the way. A Supreme Court justice being unmasked as having a partisan tilt wouldn\u2019t be illegal \u2013 just awkward and icky. Alito won\u2019t even have to recuse himself from any cases for possibly showing an electoral preference since there\u2019s no binding code of ethics for Supreme Court justices. He clarified on May 29 in a letter to lawmakers that he would not recuse himself from any cases as a result of the flag controversy. His wife, Alito said, is entitled to her First Amendment rights. \u201cMy wife is fond of flying flags,\u201d\u00a0Alito\u00a0wrote. \u201cI am not.\u201d And the Alito flag incident is small time compared with the direct involvement of Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019 wife Ginni in the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally on January 6, 2021, and her active texting with officials in the White House about how to overturn election results \u2013 something for which Thomas has not offered excuse, apology or recusal. But the \u201cMrs. defense\u201d could be used in much more serious matters than flag flying. Menendez \u2018in the dark\u2019 Take the prosecution of Sen. Bob Menendez, the New Jersey Democrat on trial in New York for federal bribery charges. Menendez\u2019s trial is severed from one of his co-defendants, his wife, Nadine. Both Mr. and Mrs. Menendez deny wrongdoing, but at the outset of his trial this month, it seemed likely that one element of his defense could be to blame his wife. The senator was \u201cin the dark\u201d on money matters, his attorney told jurors. Most of the communication referenced in the indictment is between Nadine Menendez and the New Jersey businessmen who are alleged to have coughed up gold bars and envelopes of cash, along with much more, as they sought Sen. Menendez\u2019s help. Couples behaving badly Former Rep. Duncan Hunter, a California Republican, pioneered the Mrs. defense when he and his wife were both accused of funneling campaign funds for private use. Hunter\u2019s defense was that his wife, Margaret, handled the finances in their personal lives and for his campaign. Both Hunters ultimately pleaded guilty and were later pardoned by Trump. Will it ultimately be a similar story in the prosecution of Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat, who has been charged in a bribery scheme along with his wife, Imelda? The Cuellars present a united front and deny all wrongdoing. Prosecutors allege payments to the couple were laundered through \u201csham consulting contracts\u201d made to \u201cfront companies\u201d owned by Mrs. Cuellar. Couples behaving badly is nothing new in US politics. Former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., an Illinois Democrat, and his wife, Sandra, pleaded guilty to misusing campaign funds to fuel a lavish lifestyle. Variations on the theme Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, were convicted of public corruption in 2014. Their strategy at trial was to portray the former Republican governor as being in the dark about his wife\u2019s activities. A unanimous US Supreme Court, including Alito, later vacated the governor\u2019s conviction and narrowed the scope by which prosecutors can pursue bribery allegations. The Mrs. defense could conceivably be turned on its head and used by a powerful woman to blame her husband. Rep. Cori Bush, a Missouri Democrat, is under investigation for misusing funds to pay her husband for security services. Bush said in a statement that she retained her husband\u2019s security services \u201cbecause he has had extensive experience in this area, and is able to provide the necessary services at or below a fair market rate,\u201d according to CNN\u2019s report. Wives taking the blame, sometimes deservedly, is not a uniquely Washington problem. In April, an Iowa woman named Kim Taylor was sentenced to eight months in prison, according to local reports, for an unsuccessful ballot stuffing scheme to help her husband in a Republican congressional primary. The husband, Jeremy Taylor, was not charged and was later elected to the Woodbury County Board of Supervisors. Alito has strong views about marriage Blaming his wife for flying an inappropriate flag is not the only reason Alito is connected to a wider discussion of the institution of marriage. He continues to complain about the Supreme Court\u2019s 2015 decision that granted the right of marriage to same-sex couples. He grouses that the court\u2019s blessing of same-sex unions means people who think marriage should be between a man and a woman can be labeled by the government as \u201cbigots.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/politics/politicians-blaming-wives-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_politics_joe-manchin-independent-not-running", "text": "West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin said Monday he\u2019s \u201cnot running for any office\u201d after registering as an independent over the Memorial Day recess, but he didn\u2019t completely rule out the possibility. \u201cI\u2019m not running for any office, political office. I\u2019ve been very clear about that,\u201d the senator told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju, insisting that his decision to become an independent had nothing to do with running for Senate or governor ahead of the\u00a0August 1\u00a0filing deadline. But pressed on whether he was closing the door on a future run, he added, \u201cI have not \u2013 I never leave any, you never leave any political opportunity and walk away from that, so you always have options, because life is full of surprises. But I have no intention of running for political office.\u201d Manchin, whose announcement last year that he wasn\u2019t seeking reelection was a political gift to Republicans hoping to flip the Senate, noted that he had informed President Joe Biden and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of his decision to leave the party before he did so. The retiring senator said that he decided to become an independent now so he could \u201chave time under [his] belt\u201d with the label before he leaves the Senate, noting that having the letter \u201cD\u201d by his name had become \u201ctoxic\u201d in his home state, which President Donald Trump carried by nearly 40 points in 2020. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to go back home with the brands being so toxic as they are. My state\u2019s flipped so much as it has, even having a D brand \u2014 knowing that Joe is just Joe Manchin from West Virginia, they don\u2019t look at me as a Democrat or a Republican \u2014 but on that, by having a D brand, they still label you and it makes it a little bit more challenging to get through,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking and planning this for a long time. I thought the time was right, now as I\u2019m going to transition into private life, I wanted to make sure I could be an honest broker. And say \u2018Oh, he just did it because you\u2019re moving into something else.\u2019 No, I did it while I\u2019m still a senator.\u201d Manchin said it would be easier for him to focus on his post-Senate goals as an independent, like empowering the middle of the political spectrum. \u201cLet\u2019s open up some of these primaries in these states, let people have better candidates to choose from. We\u2019re getting kind of a controlled movement to where the primaries are controlled to the point that when you get to the general election, you\u2019re choices aren\u2019t what you might want, whether they be on the national level from president all the way down,\u201d he argued. Manchin, who still plans to caucus with Democrats in the Senate, said his colleagues were only \u201csurprised it took this long,\u201d and that the president \u201cunderstood\u201d why he was making this choice. \u201cI explained the dynamics of my state and the people I represent do not connect today with the Democratic Party and especially the policies of the National Democrat Party,\u201d he said. The senator said he\u2019s still not prepared to say if he\u2019ll support Biden in November and that he\u2019s hoping he can push the president more toward the political center. \u201cI haven\u2019t gotten involved in the presidential election to this point. There will be a time, there\u2019s plenty of time,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now I want to see, I want to see the Joe Biden I\u2019ve known for 37 years come back to where the Joe Biden had started from: always in the center, center-left, maybe, but always in the center to make a deal. I think he\u2019s been pulled too far by his staff to the far left.

{"id": "2024_06_03_politics_fauci-testimony-house-hearing-covid-19", "text": "Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, testified on Monday at a House subcommittee hearing about the US response to the Covid-19 pandemic and the origins of the virus. The hearing was Fauci\u2019s first public testimony on Capitol Hill since his retirement from government service. It turned contentious at times as Republicans grilled Fauci over a wide range of topics, including the basis for public health recommendations during the pandemic and email use by public health officials. Here are key takeaways from the hearing: US still needs to close communication gaps to be better prepared for next pandemic Fauci said there are still some things the US needs to work on to be more prepared for another pandemic in the aftermath of Covid-19, saying in \u201csome respects\u201d the country is better prepared to deal with a health crisis than in 2020, \u201cbut in others, I am still disappointed.\u201d One thing that he hopes the US will do better moving forward is tightening communication between the federal response and local public health officials. Fauci said there was a \u201cdisconnect between the health-care system and the public health system\u201d during Covid-19 in the US. Specifically, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention could not demand information from local agencies, which caused a lag in sharing data. \u201cWe were at a disadvantage,\u201d Fauci said, adding that the CDC is working on ways to fix this pain point. Republicans grill Fauci over public health official\u2019s use of email Fauci testified Monday that he has not used his personal email to conduct business, and he was not aware before a congressional investigation that a former senior adviser at the National Institutes of Health had used unofficial email. \u201cWhat you saw, I believe, with Dr. Morens was an aberrancy and an outlier,\u201d Fauci testified on Monday, referring to a former senior adviser at NIH. \u201cThe individuals at the NIH and NIAID are a very committed group of individuals and this one instance that you point out is an aberrancy and an outlier.\u201d The House Oversight select subcommittee on the coronavirus pandemic previously released a series of private emails that Republicans argue show that some NIH officials deleted emails and tried to get around requirements to disclose information through public records laws. In a memo published at the end of May, committee members said Dr. David Morens, a former senior adviser to Fauci, engaged in \u201cnefarious behavior.\u201d Fauci said he had worked on research publications with Morens in his role as a senior adviser, but Morens\u2019 role did not include advising Fauci on any department policy. The committee points to email that Morens sent another colleague that suggests he would send email to Fauci\u2019s private account and \u201cthere is no worry about FOIAs.\u201d FOIA is the Freedom of Information Act, the law that gives the public the right to obtain federal records, including emails sent within government agencies. Morens\u2019 email goes on to say that he can also hand information to Fauci to avoid it being a part of the public record. Fauci testifies about possible origins of virus that caused Covid-19 In Fauci\u2019s testimony, he addressed what he said were \u201ccertain issues that have been seriously distorted concerning me,\u201d particularly around the origin of the virus that led to the Covid-19 pandemic. Fauci testified that in early 2020, he was informed through phone calls with two scientists \u2014 Jeremy Farrar, then the director of the Wellcome Trust in the UK and Kristian Andersen, a scientist at Scripps Research \u2014 that they and others were concerned that the virus that causes Covid-19 could have been manipulated in the lab. The day after those calls, Fauci said he participated in a conference call with several international virologists to discuss manipulation in the lab or possible spillover from animals to humans. He characterized the discussion as \u201clively,\u201d with arguments on both sides. Fauci said he did not try to steer the discussion in any direction. Fauci said the virologists on the joint call decided to more carefully examine the genomic sequence and after further examination, and said, \u201cseveral who at first were concerned about lab manipulation became convinced that the virus was not deliberately manipulated.\u201d Scientists found the most likely scenario, Fauci said, was a virus that transferred from an animal to a human, \u201calthough they still kept an open mind.\u201d \u201cThe accusation being circulated that I influenced the scientists to change their minds by bribing them with millions of dollars in grant money is absolutely false, and simply preposterous,\u201d Fauci said, noting he had no input into the content on a paper published in March 2020 that discussed the possible origins of the virus. Some of the world\u2019s leading scientists have investigated the origins of the virus, including a committee of experts from the World Health Organization. Most scientists believe that the virus spread from animals to humans in China. Some studies have also said that the theory that the virus escaped from a Chinese lab, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, cannot be ruled out. Most US intelligence agencies say the virus was not genetically engineered, but it is still not totally clear how the pandemic started. A US intelligence analysis released last year said either origin was possible, and the community remains split on the issue. The US Department of Energy assessed last year that it had \u201clow confidence\u201d in the lab leak theory. No US federal agency believes that the virus that causes Covid-19 was created as a bioweapon. \u201cI cannot account nor can anyone account for other things that might be going on in China, which is the reason why I have always said and will say now, I keep an open mind as to what the origin is,\u201d Fauci said Monday. Fauci details threats he and his family have received Fauci detailed the threats he received during his time as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, describing death threats against him and threats against his wife and daughters. Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell asked Fauci to explain what some of the threats were and he replied: \u201cEverything from harassments from emails, texts, letters of myself, my wife, my three daughters. There have been credible death threats leading to the arrest of two individuals \u2013 and credible death threats means someone who clearly was on their way to kill me. And it\u2019s required my having protective services essentially all the time.\u201d Fauci said he feared that the threats against public health workers during the Covid-19 pandemic would serve as a \u201cpowerful disincentive\u201d for the best and brightest candidates to take up the profession. \u201cThey say to themselves, \u2018I don\u2019t want to go there. Why should I get involved in that?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re reluctant to put themselves and their family through what they see their colleagues being put through,\u201d he testified. The 6-foot social distance guideline came from the CDC, Fauci clarifies Fauci clarified that the 6-foot guidance for social distancing given during the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic did not come from him, but from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cIt actually came from the CDC. The CDC was responsible for those kinds of guidelines to schools, not me,\u201d Fauci said. Fauci, who repeated the guidance during the pandemic, once said that there was no science behind it \u2014 but he meant that there were no clinical trials to back it up. \u201cIt had little to do with me since I didn\u2019t make the recommendation and my saying \u2018there was no science behind it\u2019 meant there was no clinical trial behind that,\u201d Fauci said. He added that he believed the CDC used studies about droplets years ago as reasoning for the 6-foot guidelines. When the CDC first promoted the idea of 6-foot \u201csocial distancing\u201d for people who had to be around others during the pandemic, scientists thought that larger contaminated droplets would fall out of the air quickly and couldn\u2019t travel farther than 6 feet. At the time, the World Health Organization recommended that people keep a meter, or 3.3 feet, between them. But even as early as 2021, scientists were starting to understand that the coronavirus is airborne, meaning it could spread through droplets\u00a0and aerosols, smaller particles that could travel\u00a0even farther\u00a0and float in the air. That\u2019s in large part why public health agencies emphasized the importance of people wearing masks to reduce the number of germs that could float in the air and make people sick.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/politics/fauci-testimony-house-hearing-covid-19/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_02_politics_supreme-court-what-to-watch-trump-immunity-abortion-guns", "text": "The Supreme Court is turning toward the final, frenzied weeks of its term, readying potential blockbuster decisions on abortion, guns and former President Donald Trump\u2019s claims of absolute immunity. The decisions will land rapidly at a tense time for the 6-3 conservative-liberal court \u2013 just before a historic presidential election that has been heavily influenced by its decision two years ago to overturn Roe v. Wade. Public opinion of the court remains at record lows. Conservative Justice Samuel Alito, meanwhile, is facing sharp blowback over two controversial flags raised at his homes in Virginia and New Jersey. Here are some of the remaining cases to be decided before July. Trump claims \u2018absolute\u2019 immunity Trump\u2019s appeal for immunity from special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election subversion charges landed at the Supreme Court late in the term and instantly overshadowed most of the docket. Trump argued that without immunity, presidents would be hamstrung in office, always fearful of being second guessed by a zealous prosecutor after leaving the White House. That position appeared to have some purchase on the conservative Supreme Court during oral arguments in April, though it didn\u2019t appear Trump would be able to get Smith\u2019s case tossed entirely. The immunity case, appears likely to come down to whether Trump\u2019s post-election actions were \u201cofficial\u201d \u2013 that is, steps he was taking as president \u2013 or whether they were \u201cprivate,\u201d which would not likely receive immunity. An appeals court in Washington sided against Trump. Abortion for health in emergencies The Supreme Court will decide what happens when pregnant women show up to the hospital with medical emergencies in states that have strict bans on abortion. An Idaho law bars doctors from performing abortions unless the mother\u2019s life is at risk, but it makes no exception if that she would suffer long-term health consequences. The Biden administration argues a federal law requires hospitals to perform abortions if the health of a mother is at stake, and an appeals court agreed. The decision in Moyle v. US will place abortion access on the forefront again this summer just as Americans begin tuning into the presidential election. Access to abortion pill mifepristone Another major abortion case deals with whether the US Food and Drug Administration overstepped its authority by expanding access to the abortion pill mifepristone, such as by allowing the drug to be dispensed without in-person clinical visits. Access to mifepristone has become particularly important after the court overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago and many states banned the procedure in clinical settings. Medication abortions account for\u00a0nearly two-thirds of\u00a0all abortions in the US, according to some estimates. The appeal was filed by anti-abortion doctors who say their practices have been affected because they must treat women who had complications from the drug. The FDA and outside medical groups have stressed that mifepristone is safe. The doctors have faced scrutiny over whether they have been harmed in a way that gives them standing to sue. The lead medical group in the suit, the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, was incorporated in Amarillo, Texas, months before it sued. The location allowed the group to choose a court where it was guaranteed to be assigned to conservative US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk. Kacsmaryk invalidated the FDA\u2019s decades-old approval of mifepristone. The 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals limited that decision but rejected some of the FDA\u2019s efforts to expand access to the drug. The Supreme Court then put that ruling on hold last year, maintaining the status quo while it decided the case. January 6 rioters seek to shorten sentences A former Pennsylvania police officer who rioted at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, challenged federal obstruction charges filed against him in a case that could also affect Trump. The former president was charged with violating the same obstruction law for different reasons. The case was filed by Joseph Fischer, who was charged with multiple crimes for pushing his way into the Capitol after attending Trump\u2019s rally outside the White House on January 6. Fischer\u2019s attorney told the justices that prosecutors went too far by charging his client with \u201cobstructing\u201d an official proceeding, a crime he said Congress intended to be used to prohibit the destruction of evidence. Some 350 rioters were charged with the crime, which can add up to 20 years to a prison sentence. Prosecutors say the charge should apply to the January 6 cases because the plain meaning of the words \u201cobstruct\u201d an \u201cofficial proceeding\u201d covers the attack that interrupted Congress\u2019 counting of ballots to certify Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 win. Critics say the law was intended to prevent evidence tampering before a trial or investigation.  Guns for domestic abusers In a significant Second Amendment case, the justices must weigh the constitutionality of a federal law that bars people who are the subject of domestic violence restraining orders from possessing guns. A Texas man, Zackey Rahimi, was indicted for violating that law following a series of shootings, including one in which police said he fired into the air at a Whataburger restaurant after a friend\u2019s credit card was declined.  Rahimi\u2019s lawyers say a Supreme Court decision two years ago in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen meant the domestic violence law cannot be squared with the Constitution because it has no historical analogue. A 6-3 majority in Bruen said gun regulations must be \u201cconsistent with this nation\u2019s historical tradition of firearm regulation.\u201d An appeals court in Louisiana sided with Rahimi. Government regulation of Facebook The Supreme Court is confronting a series of cases at the intersection of the First Amendment and social media. Perhaps the most notable are two suits challenging laws enacted in Florida and Texas aimed at stopping social media giants like Facebook and X from throttling conservative views. The state laws ban online platforms from removing posts that express opinions, such as political content. The Republican governors who signed the laws said they were needed to keep the social media platforms from discriminating against conservatives. Two trade associations representing the social media companies sued, claiming they violated the First Amendment. One federal appeals court in Atlanta sided with the companies and against Florida. Another, in New Orleans, allowed the Texas law to take effect. The Supreme Court paused implementation of the Texas law in 2022. The cases are Moody v. NetChoice and NetChoice v. Paxton. Cleaning up online \u2018disinformation\u2019 The justices must decide if the White House and federal agencies such as the FBI may urge social media platforms to take down content the government views as misinformation, or whether those efforts violate the First Amendment. Biden officials have for years tried to persuade social media platforms to take down posts featuring misinformation about vaccines, the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2020 election, among other things. Republican officials in two states \u2013 Missouri and Louisiana \u2013 and five social media users sued over that practice in 2022, arguing the administration did far more than \u201cpersuade\u201d the tech giants to take down a few deceptive items. The case is Murthy v. Missouri.  Government regulations threatened A series of cases this term challenge the power of federal agencies to approve regulations \u2013 or enforce them. Among the most significant are two appeals filed by Atlantic herring fishermen. The captains are challenging a Department of Commerce regulation that requires them to pay the salary of federal observers they bring on board to monitor the catch and ensure the crew follows other fishing regulations. The court is being asked to overturn a 1984 precedent \u2013 Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council \u2013 that required courts to give deference to federal agencies when creating regulations based on an ambiguous law. Conservatives have long sought to rein in regulatory authority, arguing Washington has too much control over industry. The justices have been incrementally diminishing federal power for years, but the new case gives the court an opportunity to take a much broader stroke. Critics fear a ruling for the fishermen would threaten a vast swath of other federal regulations aimed at protecting the environment, public health and workplace safety. The cases are Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo and Relentless v. Department of Commerce. Lower courts sided with the government in both cases.

{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_biden-administration-border-executive-action", "text": "The Biden administration is preparing to roll out a sweeping border executive action as early as Tuesday, according to two sources familiar with the discussions, who cautioned that timing is fluid. White House officials have begun reaching out to mayors who represent cities along the US southern border to potentially join President Joe Biden when he announces the order, two\u00a0other\u00a0sources familiar with those conversations said. For weeks, administration officials have been working through an executive action that would dramatically limit migrants\u2019 ability to seek asylum at the US southern border \u2014 part of a strategy to try to give Biden the upper hand on one of his Republican rival\u2019s key campaign issues. The action is designed to potentially blunt Republican attacks on border security and preempt former President Donald Trump ahead of the first presidential debate, which will be held on June 27 on CNN. Edinburg Mayor\u00a0Ramiro\u00a0Garza confirmed to CNN that the administration contacted him on Saturday to attend a Tuesday event at the White House. The order is expected to be reminiscent of a controversial measure from the Trump era. It involves using an authority known as 212f between ports of entry to try to clamp down on unlawful border crossings. CNN\u00a0previously reported\u00a0that officials were discussing announcing the executive action after Mexico\u2019s election on Sunday and before the first presidential debate. Biden is scheduled to travel to France on Wednesday. \u201cWhile Congressional Republicans chose to stand in the way of additional border enforcement, President Biden will not stop fighting to deliver the resources that border and immigration personnel need to secure our border,\u201d a White House spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cAs we have said before, the Administration continues to explore a series of policy options and we remain committed to taking action to address our broken immigration system.\u201d Several Texas mayors have previously expressed frustration over the hyperpolarization over immigration as tensions between Biden and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott escalated. During his February trip to the US southern border, Biden met with Garza, Brownsville Mayor John Cowen, San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg, and Weslaco Mayor Adrian Gonzalez. A White House official told CNN that no final decisions have been made on additional executive actions. With border arrests down this year, thanks in part to Mexico stepping up its own enforcement efforts in January, the White House is looking to take advantage of a brief reprieve from one of the most politically fraught issues Biden faces in his reelection campaign. Some Democrats on Capitol Hill have also encouraged White House officials to consider having the president make another visit to the border in the coming weeks. A White House spokesperson previously told CNN that no border trip for Biden is under consideration at the moment. Over recent weeks, the administration has trotted out a series of policy changes to try to dissuade migrants from journeying to the US and convince skeptical voters they are working to tighten up immigration at the border. That includes\u00a0rolling out new guidance and regulations that would tighten the immigration system to quickly reject migrants who are ineligible for asylum and speed up court cases for some migrants \u2014 measures Biden officials hope will, in part, keep the number of border crossings low.

{"id": "2024_06_01_politics_trump-what-is-next-verdict", "text": "The next time former President Donald Trump holds a campaign rally will be his first as a convicted felon. When that will be remains to be seen \u2013 one of countless unknowns heading into an unprecedented election made more extraordinary by the events of the past week. The 34-count guilty verdict reached Thursday by a Manhattan jury \u2013 the first criminal conviction of a former president \u2013 landed like a bomb on the American political landscape. Trump\u2019s campaign had long braced for this outcome, readying their candidate and his supporters for an unfavorable conclusion by casting the case as a political spectacle. But now that a verdict has arrived, uncertainty lurks behind every decision. No one can say with confidence how voters will respond to this historical moment, or how they will weigh Trump\u2019s conviction against other factors \u2013 including their view of President Joe Biden or issues affecting their pocketbooks or personal health such as inflation and abortion access. Even if the sliver of undecided Americans are ultimately unmoved by the jury\u2019s decision, it\u2019s unclear whether they will gravitate to a seething candidate and a party so plainly seeking revenge. Trump\u2019s instinct to attack when backed into a corner took hold Friday in the first extended window into how he intends to forge ahead post-verdict. In a freewheeling and grievance-filled 33-minute speech at Trump Tower, the former president rifled through standard stump speech lines about border security and Biden\u2019s stewardship of the country before lashing out at the individuals he deemed responsible for his legal peril. Trump likened Juan Merchan, the judge overseeing the case, to a \u201cdevil\u201d and called the prosecution\u2019s star witness, his former lawyer Michael Cohen, a \u201csleaze bag.\u201d Trump continued to claim that Biden was behind the New York hush money case, an assertion that he regularly repeats without evidence. At the conclusion of his remarks, the former president signaled a readiness to move on to the campaign trail after spending the past two months largely tied to a Manhattan courtroom. \u201cNovember 5 is the most important day in the history of the country,\u201d Trump declared Friday, a day after saying that the election would deliver \u201cthe real verdict.\u201d Unclear, though, is when Trump is planning to take this message on the road. His calendar is notably bare, without any announced upcoming public events, a schedule crafted to accommodate jury deliberations that could have continued indefinitely. Instead, Trump is expected to spend the weekend at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club, two sources familiar with his schedule told CNN. Late next week, he begins a West Coast fundraising trip with stops in California and Nevada. The hush money case, too, is far from over and will continue to hover over the political season. Trump and his lawyer, Todd Blanche, have indicated they will appeal, a process that could outlast the campaign itself. A gag order that limited whom Trump could talk about during the legal proceedings also remains in place. Merchan has set a July 11 sentencing date \u2013 which falls four days before Republicans gather in Milwaukee to officially nominate Trump at their national convention. The former president\u2019s legal team is undecided on whether to ask Merchan to move the date, CNN reported Thursday, leaving the door open for his sentence to become a focal point of the party\u2019s convention messaging. Leveraging legal drama Trump has leveraged his legal troubles since a New York grand jury, in March 2023, issued the first of the former president\u2019s four indictments. The indictments effectively galvanized Republican voters around Trump\u2019s third White House bid, helping him overcome well-funded primary competition from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and others who thought the party might be ready to move on from the former president. In campaign speeches across the country over the past year, Trump is often fixated on his cases and leans on them to rally his supporters and even reach out to new audiences. He has suggested that his mug shot, captured after he was indicted in Georgia for attempting to overturn the state\u2019s 2020 election result, would appeal to Black voters. Last weekend, Trump attempted to connect with a Libertarian crowd by mentioning the charges he faces. \u201cSo, if I wasn\u2019t a Libertarian before, I sure as hell am a Libertarian now,\u201d he said. However, the campaign intends to message on his conviction going forward, and it will do so with new firepower. Trump\u2019s team quickly capitalized on Republican outrage stemming from Thursday\u2019s verdict. A flurry of fundraising appeals helped bring in almost $53 million in donations in the 24 hours after the jury announced its decision, his campaign said. Throughout Washington, Trump\u2019s allies \u2013 some of them jockeying to be his running mate \u2013 responded Friday with a series of escalating calls for retribution on his behalf. Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, demanded that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and Matthew Colangelo, an attorney in the prosecutor\u2019s office, testify next week \u201cabout the unprecedented political prosecution of President Trump.\u201d Several Republican senators \u2013 including vice presidential contenders Marco Rubio of Florida and JD Vance of Ohio \u2013 signed a letter signifying they would not work with the Biden administration to pass legislation, confirm his judicial nominees or increase nonsecurity spending. Vance, during a Friday appearance on Fox News, vowed to \u201cfight back\u201d with investigations of Democrats and their donors and by subpoenaing Merchan and his daughter. The judge\u2019s daughter, who served as president of a campaign consulting firm that works with Democratic candidates, became a target of Trump\u2019s attacks before Merchan included her in his gag order. \u201cWe need to get to the bottom of it, and when we find wrongdoing, we have to be able to actually punish it,\u201d Vance said. \u201cThat is the only language that I think these people are going to understand.\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign is already making clear it intends to call out Republicans deemed insufficiently loyal in this moment. When Larry Hogan, a former Maryland governor and Republican Senate candidate, called for Americans to \u201crespect the verdict and the legal process,\u201d Trump campaign manager Chris LaCivita responded on social media: \u201cYou just ended your campaign.\u201d LaCivita also called out the College Republicans National Committee for posting on social media: \u201cThe outcome of this trial should be respected.\u201d \u201cOpinions are like a**holes,\u201d LaCivita wrote. \u201cEveryone has one.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kristen Holmes contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/politics/trump-what-is-next-verdict/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_politics_netanyahu-scheduled-speech-congress", "text": "A date for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s address to Congress remains uncertain after one date initially floated was ruled out because it fell on a Jewish holiday. A US congressional leadership aide initially said Monday that Netanyahu was scheduled to speak on June 13, which falls on\u00a0Shavuot. It also coincides with President Joe Biden\u2019s visit to Italy for a Group of 7 summit. House Speaker Mike Johnson said congressional leaders are looking at various options for Netanyahu to address Congress in light of the scheduling issue. \u201cWe are trying to get this done in the next couple of weeks, and there is a sense of urgency on our side and the prime minister\u2019s, so I hope we can get it done,\u201d the Louisiana Republican told reporters Monday evening. Johnson added, \u201cWe have a couple different options we are looking at \u2014 his staff and mine \u2014 so we will figure it out.\u201d A source familiar with the planning of the visit said Netanyahu is likely to come to Washington in July to address Congress. The top four congressional Republican and Democratic leaders\u00a0extended the invitation\u00a0to Netanyahu last week, but it wasn\u2019t clear at the time whether the prime minister\u2019s visit to Washington would also include a meeting at the White House. Scheduling the speech while Biden is on another continent would have skirted that question. Biden is planning to attend a summit of Group of 7 leaders in Puglia, Italy, which runs from June 13 to 15. The dates have been set for several months. Biden and Netanyahu have spoken by phone regularly since the October 7 attacks by Hamas that set off the current grinding conflict in Gaza, and they last met in person when the president flew to Tel Aviv in the days immediately following the attack. The leaders\u2019 relationship, however, has become strained over Israel\u2019s war plans and over efforts to alleviate humanitarian suffering in the Palestinian enclave. The decision this year to invite Netanyahu to speak to a joint meeting of Congress was not met with unanimous approval among Democrats, some of whom have vowed to boycott the speech. The war in Gaza has divided Democrats; many in the party say Netanyahu has become an obstacle to peace. Even Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called earlier this year for new elections in Israel, with the implication Netanyahu leave power. But the New York Democrat nonetheless signed on to the letter inviting the prime minister to speak to Congress. \u201cWe join the State of Israel in your struggle against terror, especially as Hamas continues to hold American and Israeli citizens captive and its leaders jeopardize regional stability,\u201d stated the letter from Schumer, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Last week, Biden laid out an Israeli proposal to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas in exchange for a ceasefire, hoping to break a logjam in the stalled negotiations. The move, which was unusual in the level of detail being revealed about another government\u2019s proposal, seemed designed to put Netanyahu on the spot to either support the framework or reject what Biden said was the Israeli government\u2019s own plan. Israel has declined to formally endorse the proposal, however, and Netanyahu told the Knesset\u2019s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Monday that \u201cthe claim that we agreed to a ceasefire without our conditions being met is not true.\u201d He appeared to be referring to the permanent ceasefire outlined in the second phase of the Israeli proposal. Speaking to reporters Monday, White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby repeated Biden\u2019s assertion that the proposal the president spelled out was an Israeli plan. \u201cWe\u2019re comfortable that it represents fairly and honestly an Israeli proposal \u2013 a very forward-leaning Israeli proposal, and we\u2019re confident that Hamas needs to take it,\u201d he said.

Unaccompanied children would be exempt \u2013 a key piece of the executive order that would worry immigration advocates who have said such an exemption could encourage some families to send children to the border on their own. The executive action would allow authorities to turn away migrants while in effect either to Mexico or their origin country.\u00a0The US previously worked with Mexico when a Covid-19-era border restriction, known as Title 42, also resulted in certain migrants being returned to Mexico. Sources who described the order to CNN cautioned that changes could still be made to the text before it was expected to be publicly unveiled this week. The action would mark a significant policy shift for the Biden administration, which has taken a more aggressive approach to border security after years of grappling with border crises fueled by record migration\u00a0as it has attempted\u00a0to blunt Republican attacks during a heated election year. Border authorities have recently been apprehending just under 4,000 migrants unlawfully crossing the border, according to a Homeland Security official, and there have been\u00a0roughly 1,500 appointments per day through the US Customs and Border Protection mobile app. Under the executive order, the border would reopen once daily illegal crossings drop, according to one of the sources. Senior White House officials, including chief of staff Jeff Zients,\u00a0have been calling lawmakers and other stakeholders over the weekend to brief them on the plans, according to two sources familiar with the discussions. CNN first reported that the White House began outreach to border mayors to have them attend the announcement. Edinburg Mayor\u00a0Ramiro\u00a0Garza confirmed to CNN that the administration contacted him on Saturday to attend a Tuesday event at the White House. Brownsville Mayor John Cowen said he was invited as well and will attend.\u00a0Harlingen Mayor Norma Sepulveda and Laredo Mayor Dr. Victor D. Trevino have also confirmed that they are expected to attend the event.\u00a0McAllen Mayor Javier Villalobos also said he was invited but will be unable to attend.

{"id": "2024_06_02_politics_hunter-biden-trial-preview", "text": "Hunter Biden is set to stand trial Monday on felony gun charges in a historic case that could impact President Joe Biden\u2019s reelection campaign. This is the first time in American history that the child of the sitting president is going on trial. The indictment was brought by the Justice Department, specifically by David Weiss, the special counsel appointed last year to oversee the Hunter Biden probes. Hunter Biden, 54, is accused of illegally purchasing and possessing a gun while abusing or being addicted to drugs, a violation of federal law. He pleaded not guilty to the three charges, though he has been open about\u00a0his struggles\u00a0with alcohol and crack cocaine addiction. The trial could last one to two weeks and is taking place in Wilmington, Delaware. What are the charges? The first two charges in the\u00a0three-count indictment\u00a0are tied to the gun purchase itself. When a person buys a gun, they must fill out a form with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and affirm that they are legally allowed to buy the weapon. Hunter Biden has been charged with lying on those forms. These questions include: Have you been convicted of a felony? Are you a fugitive? Are you in the country unlawfully? And, importantly for this case, are you an \u201cunlawful user of, or addicted to\u201d illegal drugs? Hunter Biden allegedly\u00a0checked the box\u00a0that said, \u201cNo.\u201d Count 3 relates to the possession of the gun. It\u2019s also against federal law to possess a gun if you are abusing drugs. Hunter Biden had the gun for 11 days in October 2018, before his girlfriend threw it in a dumpster because she was worried about his mental health, according to the indictment and texts made public in recent court filings. \u201cGuns present a danger if they get in the wrong hands, and that\u2019s the impetus behind these laws,\u201d Nabeel Kibria, a Washington, DC-based defense attorney who has handled hundreds of gun cases, told CNN. \u201cThe evidence seems pretty stacked against Hunter \u2026 but who determines who is an addict? What are the bright-line rules that must be followed?\u201d Who are the witnesses? Prosecutors have said they plan to call about a dozen witnesses for their case. Most notably, they\u2019ve\u00a0lined up testimony\u00a0from three of Hunter Biden\u2019s former romantic partners to testify about his drug use around the time he bought the gun. This includes his ex-wife,\u00a0Kathleen Buhle and his late brother\u2019s widow,\u00a0Hallie Biden, whom Hunter Biden later dated. Their testimony could bring to life a period that Hunter Biden has described as his rock bottom, during which he was almost always on drugs or trying to get drugs. At his attempted plea hearing last year, Hunter Biden testified that he has been sober since May 2019. \u201cHe\u2019s going to experience stress and shame at the trial,\u201d said Valerie Earnshaw, a social psychology professor at the University of Delaware who researches the stigmas surrounding addiction. \u201cIt depends on his own recovery journey, but there could be days where he experiences a lot of shame. It\u2019s a toxic emotion that eats you up. It does not motivate healthy behaviors.\u201d Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers\u00a0wanted to\u00a0call an expert who\u00a0could\u00a0tell the jury about how people with addictions understand their own struggles.\u00a0But in a ruling Sunday, the judge blocked the defense attorneys from using that witness because of procedural defects with their disclosures to prosecutors about what the expert might say. His team also has a forensic chemist who could testify about a white residue on his gun pouch that prosecutors say testified positive for cocaine when it was analyzed by the FBI in 2023. Who are the prosecutors? The case was initiated by Weiss, the former Donald Trump-appointed US attorney in Delaware. Attorney General Merrick Garland\u00a0elevated\u00a0Weiss to special counsel status last year, after a proposed plea deal with Hunter Biden\u00a0blew up\u00a0in spectacular fashion. Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers claimed Weiss only sought the indictment because he caved to a relentless pressure campaign from Republican lawmakers and the former president. Weiss\u00a0panned\u00a0this theory as a \u201cfiction designed for a Hollywood script,\u201d and the judge overseeing the gun case\u00a0concluded the allegations were \u201cnonsensical under the facts here.\u201d But many Republicans have criticized Weiss, claiming he offered Hunter Biden a \u201csweetheart deal\u201d last year that would have\u00a0resolved\u00a0the gun matter and ended a tax probe with a misdemeanor-only plea. (Legal experts\u00a0told CNN at the time that the proposed deal was reasonable.) Who is the judge? District Judge Maryellen Noreika is presiding over the case. A former patent lawyer, she had the support of Delaware\u2019s two Democratic senators when she was appointed by Trump. The Senate\u00a0confirmed her nomination\u00a0with a unanimous voice vote in 2018. She oversaw last summer\u2019s dramatic hearing during which both sides asked her to approve a plea deal. But she balked and uncovered through tough questioning that there were grave differences between the parties about the scope of the deal. That hearing ended without a resolution, and the plea discussions later collapsed. That\u2019s when Garland named Weiss as special counsel. Noreika\u2019s no-nonsense approach has kept the proceedings moving in a steady fashion. She rejected Hunter Biden\u2019s attempts to toss the case or derail the prosecution but has sided with him on several key\u00a0evidentiary questions. Could Hunter Biden go to prison? If convicted on all three counts, the president\u2019s son could face up to 25 years in prison. However, he doesn\u2019t have a prior criminal record, and first-time offenders often get much lower sentences than the maximum. His punishment would be solely up to Noreika. These are federal charges, so Joe Biden has the power to pardon his son at any time. If his son is convicted, the president could also commute the sentence, sparing him from the levied punishment. The White House has\u00a0explicitly ruled out\u00a0the possibility of a pardon, but that political calculus could change after the November election. Has this ever happened before? This is a historic moment for the United States and the history of the presidency. No president has ever tried to run the country while watching his own child go on trial. Over the decades, there are plenty of examples of presidential family members getting in trouble. George H. W. Bush\u2019s son\u00a0faced civil penalties\u00a0for violating banking laws while his father was serving in the White House. \u00a0Jimmy Carter\u2019s\u00a0brother\u00a0was scrutinized for his foreign lobbying. But nothing has sunk to the level of a criminal trial. CNN presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said that \u201cthere\u2019s always somebody considered a black sheep in the presidential family\u201d but that Hunter Biden\u2019s sprawling legal issues \u201ccut unusually close to the bone because it\u2019s the president\u2019s son.\u201d \u201cThis trial is an albatross around President Biden\u2019s neck and weighs very heavily on his psyche,\u201d Brinkley said. \u201cFor any parent to watch their child go through addiction, and now face possible jail time, it\u2019s harrowing. You would hope that family would be his comfort zone. But in this case, family is probably his biggest worry of the moment.\u201d The family ties have also led to some intriguing divergences between father and son. There is a\u00a0separate court battle\u00a0over the constitutionality of the law that makes it illegal for drug users to own a gun. The Biden administration is defending the law and wants the Supreme Court to take up the matter. But Hunter Biden\u2019s team argued in his case \u2013\u00a0unsuccessfully\u00a0\u2013 that the law violates the Second Amendment. The jury pool Approximately 250 Delaware residents have been summoned for jury service, according to the judge. They\u2019ll be whittled down to a panel of 12 seated jurors and four alternates. Delaware is one of the smallest states in the country, and the Biden family looms large. As part of the selection process \u2013 called voir dire \u2013 prospective jurors\u00a0will be asked\u00a0whether they can stay impartial regardless of their views about the 2024 election. They\u2019ll also be asked whether they can keep an open mind about Hunter Biden and even whether they\u2019ve been eligible to vote in past elections for Joe Biden, who has held public office in Delaware since 1971. Other questions touch on the highly politicized atmosphere surrounding the case, including, \u201cDo you believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted in this case because his father is the President of the United States?\u201d or, coming from the other side, whether they think he \u201cis not being prosecuted for other crimes because his father is the President.\u201d What has Hunter Biden said? Since his indictments last year, Hunter Biden hasn\u2019t said much about his legal cases. He\u00a0spoke out in December\u00a0amid his fight with the House Republicans who are probing his business dealings and took responsibility for having \u201cmade mistakes in my life and wasted opportunities and privileges that I was afforded.\u201d But he slammed the \u201cMAGA right\u201d lawmakers who \u201cridiculed my struggle with addiction\u201d and \u201cbelittled my recovery.\u201d \u201cThey have tried to dehumanize me, all to embarrass and damage my father,\u201d he said. Previously, Hunter Biden shared intensely personal details about his addiction in his\u00a02021 memoir, which prosecutors plan to use against him at trial. He described his stints in rehab, his relapses, how he bought drugs near the White House, and the stretches of time when he \u201chad no plan beyond the moment-to-moment demands of the crack pipe.\u201d The laptop, texts and emails One of the most notable pieces of evidence in the case will be messages from Hunter Biden\u2019s\u00a0infamous laptop, which has been at the center of a yearslong political saga. Weiss said the material \u201cis real\u201d and will be an important part of his case, rebutting past claims from the president\u2019s son that the laptop might be fake or even Russian disinformation. Republican officials\u00a0and\u00a0right-wing outlets\u00a0have seized on the laptop\u2019s embarrassing emails and sexually explicit images to attack Hunter Biden, while his lawyers say the files\u00a0were manipulated and\u00a0sued a repair-shop owner\u00a0who helped make the materials public. Many on the right celebrated this move by Weiss, even if he hasn\u2019t verified their loftier anti-Biden allegations. The New York Post, the conservative tabloid that was first to publish messages from the laptop in 2020, recently\u00a0took a victory lap\u00a0on its front cover. In a ruling last month, Noreika said she\u2019ll let Hunter Biden challenge the authenticity of any messages introduced at trial. Some of the texts contain gut-wrenching arguments between Hunter Biden and his loved ones about his sobriety. Others show him meeting up with drug dealers, including some just a few blocks from the Wilmington federal courthouse. \u201cI\u2019m a liar and a thief and a blamer and a user and I\u2019m delusional and an addict unlike beyond and above all other addicts that you know and I\u2019ve ruined every relationship I\u2019ve ever cherished,\u201d he texted Hallie Biden in\u00a0November\u00a02018, according to Weiss\u2019 filings. Prosecutors plan to use the laptop to\u00a0specifically support their claim that he was using illegal drugs when he bought the gun in 2018. Weiss\u00a0has not addressed \u2013 and the case is not about \u2013 Republicans\u2019\u00a0unproven allegation\u00a0that emails from the laptop prove that Hunter Biden and his father were involved in corrupt foreign business deals. What about the tax charges? This is just one of two trials Hunter Biden faces this year. The second case is scheduled for September in Los Angeles and revolves around Hunter Biden\u2019s\u00a0troubled finances. He has\u00a0pleaded not guilty\u00a0to tax evasion, filing false tax returns and failing to file his taxes on time. Originally, the trials were both scheduled for June, but Hunter Biden got a reprieve from the California federal judge, who\u00a0agreed to postpone\u00a0that trial. But the September trial date means that case will coincide with the final stretch of the presidential campaign. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misidentified a potential prosecution witness. It has also been updated to correct when Hunter Biden sent Hallie Biden a 2018 text.

{"id": "2024_06_03_politics_takeaways-day-1-hunter-biden-trial", "text": "Guns, addiction and politics hung over jury selection at Hunter Biden\u2019s criminal trial Monday, with at-times emotional questioning that resulted in the selection of a diverse 12-member panel. Throughout the day at the federal courthouse in Wilmington, prospective jurors were asked for their thoughts on the politicization of the criminal justice system, the state of US gun laws and their relationships with people struggling with addiction. These topics will weigh heavily in the case against Hunter Biden, who made history Monday by becoming the first child of a sitting US president to go on trial. He pleaded not guilty to unlawfully buying and possessing a firearm while abusing drugs, which is against federal law. Hunter Biden is a recovering alcohol and crack cocaine addict. The final 12-member jury is evenly split between six men and six women. A majority of the panel is Black, according to CNN\u2019s observations. There are also four alternates. Opening statements are set for 9 a.m. ET Tuesday, where prosecutors will spell out their allegations that Hunter Biden was an active drug user when he bought a revolver at a Wilmington gun shop in October 2018. They have contemporaneous texts and testimony from three of his romantic partners who, they say, can back up their case. Hunter Biden\u2019s attorneys take issue with the case itself \u2013 they claim special counsel David Weiss was motivated by political bias against the president. But Judge Maryellen Noreika blocked them from arguing this to the jury. So, their defense will likely focus on narrower questions about the definition of \u201caddict\u201d and the forms involved in the gun purchase. Here are\u00a0takeaways\u00a0from the first day of Hunter Biden\u2019s long-awaited trial: Pain of addiction takes center stage Throughout the day, prospective jurors opened up about their loved ones who struggled with addiction, in front of a fully packed courtroom with reporters from around the world. Several of those jurors, who all hail from Delaware, made it onto the final jury panel. One woman on the jury said her sister was a \u201crecovering addict\u201d who was previously convicted of drug crimes and credit card fraud and did time in Delaware state prison. Another woman who is on the jury said her best friend from childhood died from a heroin overdose. One man who wasn\u2019t picked for the jury had trouble getting the words out when he talked about his nephew\u2019s multiple stints in and out of rehab. This all ties into the case because prosecutors will need to zero in on Hunter Biden\u2019s long-acknowledged struggles with addiction to win a conviction. They plan to highlight deeply personal and traumatic messages that he exchanged with family, where he fought about his sobriety, and said drugs \u201cruined every relationship I\u2019ve ever cherished.\u201d How the jurors interpret Hunter\u2019s addiction may determine the verdict. Jurors were also pressed on another key aspects of the case: guns The jury pool included a wide range of views on gun rights in the US, with some saying certain firearms \u2013 like so-called assault weapons \u2013 should be banned and others praising the Second Amendment. Several jurors selected said they owned a firearm, one of whom had a concealed carry license and said\u00a0he believed \u201cour Second Amendment right is very important, and I stand with it.\u201d When asked about her views on drugs and gun ownership, a woman selected said people who smoke marijuana should be allowed to own firearms, saying that \u201cweed, to me, isn\u2019t as bad as\u201d other drugs, like heroin. Another juror selected as an alternate said she believed that mental health evaluations should be part of the process to possess a firearm, citing school shootings and saying that gun laws should be \u201cmore strict.\u201d A family affair This is personal for the Bidens. President Biden issued a rare statement about his son\u2019s case. And first lady Jill Biden was in the courtroom throughout the day, sitting in the pews, a few feet from Hunter, as she celebrated her 73rd birthday. \u201cI am the President, but I am also a Dad,\u201d President Biden\u2019s statement said. \u201cJill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. Hunter\u2019s resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us.\u201d The president was clear to say that \u201cI don\u2019t and won\u2019t comment on pending federal cases,\u201d and didn\u2019t say anything about the prosecutors or their motivations in going after his son. As president, if Biden wanted to shut down this case, he could do so today, by issuing a full pardon to Hunter. But the White House has repeatedly and explicitly ruled that out. In the courtroom in Wilmington, the first lady was flanked her daughter Ashley Biden and by Hunter\u2019s current wife Sandi Cohen. Also sitting in the same row was Kevin Morris, the Hollywood lawyer who has bankrolled Hunter Biden\u2019s lofty legal bills over the past several years.

Delligatti was convicted of attempted murder, among other crimes, for hatching a plot to murder a local \u201cbully\u201d who was \u201cterrorizing\u201d a gas station that Delligatti and his associates frequented. Delligatti hired members of the Crips gang through an intermediary to carry out the killing, court records show, and gave them a .38 revolver. Police intercepted the gang members before they were able to carry out the killing. Delligatti was convicted of several crimes and sentenced to 25 years in prison \u2013 including five years for the gun charge. That charge was based on a federal law that prohibits people from possessing a gun as part of a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d Delligatti, also known as \u201cFat Sal,\u201d argues the underlying crime in his case doesn\u2019t qualify as a crime of violence. Federal appeals courts have split over how to apply the charge in similar circumstances and the Justice Department \u2013 though it opposes Delligatti\u2019s argument in his case \u2013 agreed that the Supreme Court should take up his appeal to provide clarity for lower courts. The Supreme Court in recent years has limited the circumstances under which prosecutors may seek enhanced prison sentences for a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d In a decision Delligatti relies on heavily in his appeal, a 7-2 majority of the Supreme Court two years ago ruled in favor of a Virginia defendant who was convicted of the gun charge for using a gun in an attempted robbery.

{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_turnout-2024-election-analysis", "text": "For decades, Democrats have built their electoral strategies on a common assumption: the higher the turnout, the better their chances of winning. But that familiar equation may no longer apply for President Joe Biden in 2024. A wide array of polls this year shows Biden running best among Americans with the most consistent history of voting, while former President Donald Trump often displays the most strength among people who have been the least likely to vote. These new patterns are creating challenges for each party. Trump\u2019s potential appeal to more irregular voters, particularly younger Black and Latino men, is compelling Democrats to rethink longstanding strategies that focused on mobilizing as many younger and non-White voters as possible without worrying about their partisan allegiance. For Republicans, the challenge will be to build an organization capable of connecting with irregular voters they have not traditionally focused on reaching, particularly in minority communities. \u201cWhat all this means is this election has volatility,\u201d says Daniel Hopkins, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist who has studied the widening partisan divergence between voters with and without a consistent history of turning out. \u201cWe used to expect that the marginal non-voter, the next voter who turned out if an election was very engaging, didn\u2019t look different from people who did vote. In this case, the crowd that hasn\u2019t gotten engaged looks very, very different.\u201d Merged results from the three most recent national NBC polls, conducted by a bipartisan team of prominent Democratic and Republican pollsters, for instance, found that Biden leads Trump by 4 percentage points among people who voted in both 2020 and 2022. But among those who voted in 2020 but not 2022, Trump led Biden by 12 percentage points. Trump\u2019s lead swelled to 20 percentage points among those who did not vote in either 2020 or 2022. Fully 65% of those who did not vote in either of the past two elections said they disapproved of Biden\u2019s performance in office. Combined results from recent national New York Times/Siena College polls likewise have found Biden narrowly leading among potential 2024 voters who turned out in 2020 while trailing Trump by double digits among those who did not vote in their previous contest. Hopkins has conducted perhaps the most ambitious attempt to quantify the divergence between Americans with and without a history of voting. Earlier this year, he and a colleague worked with NORC at the University of Chicago to survey over 2,400 adults about their preferences in the 2024 race. The poll only surveyed people who were old enough to vote in each of the past three elections \u2014 the midterms of 2018 and 2022 and the 2020 presidential race. The results were striking. Among adults who had voted in each of the past three federal elections, Biden led Trump by 11 points, and Biden eked out a narrow advantage among voters who participated in two of the past three races. But, the poll found, Trump led Biden by 12 percentage points among those who voted in just one of the past three elections and by a crushing margin of 18 percentage points among those who came out for none of them. As important, the pattern held across racial lines. In the poll, Trump ran even with Biden among Latinos who voted in two, one or none of the past three elections, while Biden held a nearly 20-point advantage among those who voted in all three. With Black voters, Biden\u2019s lead was just 10 points among those who did not show up for any of the past three elections, but over 80 points among those who participated in all three. Using data from Catalist, a leading Democratic voter targeting firm, Michael Podhorzer, the former political director of the AFL-CIO, reached similar conclusions. He found that in 2020 Biden\u2019s margins over Trump were higher among people who voted in the three previous elections of 2018, 2016 and 2014 than those who voted in some or none of them \u2014 and that the relationship held across racial lines. Hopkins said the gap between habitual and irregular voters in his latest survey was far greater than the difference he found when he conducted a similar poll early in the 2016 race between Trump and Hillary Clinton. Key to this widening chasm, he believes, may be another dynamic: Adults who are less likely to vote are also less likely to follow political news. \u201cFor more infrequent voters, these are often people who pay less attention to politics and whose political barometer is more the question of how is my family doing economically, how does the country seem to be doing,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cFor those voters, Donald Trump\u2026is not especially unusual.\u201d By contrast, Hopkins said, a \u201csizable sliver\u201d of habitual voters \u201chave a sense that Trump may be qualitatively different than other political candidates with respect to norm violations and January 6.\u201d\u00a0For less frequent voters, he added, the equation may be as simple as \u201cthey don\u2019t love what they see with Joe Biden, and if Donald Trump is the person running against Joe Biden, they want change.\u201d The NBC polling results buttress that conclusion: It found that among the roughly one-sixth of voters who say they do not follow political news, Trump led Biden by fully 2-to-1. Several analysts caution that while this divergence between high- and low-frequency voters is appearing consistently in polls now, it\u2019s too early to say for certain whether it will persist through Election Day. \u201cIt\u2019s May,\u201d said Republican pollster Bill McInturff, whose firm conducts the NBC poll with a Democratic partner. \u201cThis data matters when people start having to vote.\u201d Democratic strategist Tom Bonier pointed out that public opinion surveys often have enough trouble measuring attitudes among young people and minorities, let alone accurately capturing those who are most disengaged from the political system. Melissa Morales \u2014 founder and president of Somos Votantes and Somos PAC, groups that mobilize Latino voters \u2014 said that in their outreach campaigns this year, they are not seeing the tilt toward Trump among low-frequency voters evident in these multiple polls. In their work during 2022, she said,\u00a0\u201cWe were hearing it in the field, with low propensity Latino voters, they were open to Trump, especially [over] the economy.\u201d But, she added, \u201cWe are not hearing that in the field right now\u201d and instead \u201cwhat we are hearing is deep concern about the cost of living, rising costs, and a strong desire to know what the path forward is.\u201d Even with all these cautions, there are strong reasons to believe that Trump may benefit more from a very large overall turnout this year than Biden would. That conclusion is consistent with the other unusual demographic patterns evident in the 2024 election. So far, in almost all polls, Biden is holding a higher share of his 2020 vote among White than non-White voters; he\u2019s also maintaining more of his 2020 level of support with seniors than with young people. Among Whites, Biden, as in 2020, is running much better with those who hold at least a four-year college degree than those who don\u2019t. Biden\u2019s relative strength among seniors and college-educated White voters means that he\u2019s drawing from two of the most reliable voting blocs in the electorate. In 2020, about 75% of people older than 65 voted, compared to just 54% of young people aged 18-29, according to calculations from Census data by William Frey, a demographer at Brookings Metro. (Even that was a big increase in turnout among young people from the 2012 and 2016 elections.) Far more White voters with degrees turned out than those without them as well. Turnout was especially modest among the Black and Latino voters who have shown the most receptivity to Trump \u2014 men without a college degree. Only slightly less than half of them voted in 2020, Frey found. Most experts who study turnout consider it unlikely that as many people will vote this year as in 2020, largely because so many voters hold negative views about both Biden and Trump. After a record 160 million people voted in 2020, Bonier said his preliminary calculation is that turnout in 2024 is more likely to reach between 145-150 million with the possibility that as few as 140 million people will vote. Jeremy Smith, CEO of Civitech, a Democratic voter data and targeting firm, said that the number of people registered to even potentially vote is way down from the total at this point in the 2020 cycle. \u201cGenerally, if you said there are two possible electorates \u2014 one is 140 million people voting and one is 160 million people \u2014 the high likelihood is that the 140 would be better for Biden,\u201d said Bonier, a senior adviser and former CEO of TargetSmart, a leading Democratic targeting firm. If turnout shrinks from 2020, the key question for the two sides will be which voters fall away \u2014 and how many new voters enter the electorate to replace them. Generally, Democrats believe that in the Trump era the party benefits when the most habitual voters comprise a larger share of the electorate. Many Democrats believe that a key reason the party exceeded expectations in the 2022 midterm is that the electorate tilted more than anticipated toward these regular voters. The Democratic polling firm Equis Research, which focuses on Latino voters, for instance, found in its post-election analysis that Democrats performed slightly better than expected with that group largely because irregular Latino voters, who were more receptive to Trump, failed to come out. Michael Madrid, a long-time GOP strategist who has become a fierce Trump critic, said that the disappointing 2022 results for Republicans showed the risk for the party in the turnout patterns that the former president has triggered. Republicans under Trump, Madrid argued, are gaining support among non-White men, particularly Latinos, while shedding support among college-educated White voters, especially women. The danger for the GOP, Madrid said, is that the latter group turns out at a far higher rate than the former (as Frey\u2019s data shows). Given that disparity, Madrid argued, Trump \u201cneeds a high turnout\u201d that pulls in less reliable minority voters, especially Latino men. Trump\u2019s conundrum, Madrid said, is that the belligerent rule-breaking persona that attracts those younger non-White men alienates more of the well-educated White women already trending away from him. \u201cHe is talking to a single young male between video games: He\u2019s got them, they love him,\u201d Madrid said. \u201cBut there are suburban women that you lose by that, who hate that. That\u2019s his dilemma. He gets the turnout, but he also gets the turnoff.\u201d The best-case scenario for Trump is that an unusually large number of these irregularly voting working-class minorities come out to vote for him. Given his success in the past two elections at turning out irregularly voting working-class Whites, no one discounts his chances of turning out irregularly voting working-class non-Whites this time. But it\u2019s hardly guaranteed: Though these voters tend to be strongly discontented with the economy, Democrats believe they can loosen Trump\u2019s hold on them by highlighting his views on other issues, such as his pledges to implement a mass deportation effort against undocumented migrants, or to pardon White supremacists convicted in the January 6, 2021, insurrection. And as Podhorzer argued, unhappiness with the economy historically has not proven to be a powerful force in motivating irregular voters to show up. But Republicans point out that even if Trump doesn\u2019t win as many of these irregularly voting non-White men as polls show today, he will still benefit if they drift toward third-party candidates or simply choose not to vote. Looking at the Black community, \u201ceven if you don\u2019t buy the potential for Trump to flip lots of votes there, it seems there\u2019s considerable risk of a turnout drop-off that will hit Biden\u2019s raw margins out of big cities in the battlegrounds that Democrats usually depend on,\u201d said GOP pollster Patrick Ruffini. For that reason, many voter mobilization experts say Democrats can\u2019t give up on infrequent voters showing receptivity to Trump. Podhorzer pointed out that Democrats can still benefit from high turnout if the campaign\u2019s final weeks focus on the aspects of Trump\u2019s agenda that most alienate the irregular voters who surged to the polls against him in 2020. Morales said the number of low-frequency Latino voters that Somos PAC turned out in Nevada in 2022 exceeded Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto\u2019s margin of victory there, and the group remains committed to reaching those same voters for Biden. \u201cNot only can we get them out to vote, but when we have a conversation about the contrast and what their votes mean on the issues, we can win those voters over,\u201d Morales said. All of these dynamics may prove most volatile with younger voters. Through the 21st century, as first Millennials and now Generation Z have entered the electorate in large numbers, Democrats have unwaveringly operated on the belief that turning out as many young voters as possible would benefit the party. But that\u2019s a much more uncertain proposition in 2024, as demonstrated by the latest youth poll from the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics, probably the most in-depth look at attitudes among young people. In the IOP poll this spring, Biden led Trump by nearly 20 points among young adults (aged 18-29) who said they definitely plan to vote in November; that lead was comparable to Biden\u2019s advantage among all young adults in 2020. But Trump\u2019s position steadily improved as the likelihood of voting diminished, with the former president leading Biden by 2-to-1 among those who said they probably would not vote. Those who indicated they were less likely to vote tended to be young people without a college degree, non-Whites and the very youngest cohort aged 18-24. John Della Volpe, the Institute of Politics\u2019 polling director, pointed out that those youngest adults probably don\u2019t remember much about Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cYounger voters today have a different view of Trump,\u201d said Della Volpe, who advised the Biden campaign in 2020 on young voters. \u201cThey were 10, 12, 13 years old when he descended down that escalator, when he blocked Muslims, when he pulled out of Paris [the international climate treaty], when he talked about Charlottesville. They were children. Their values don\u2019t align with his values, but there is less toxicity when you bring up his name. So there is this openness that wasn\u2019t there in the last two elections.\u201d Even as recently as 2020, Della Volpe said, Democrats could target young people with what politicians in the old big-city machines used to call a \u201cblind pull\u201d \u2014 where a party can focus on turning out everyone in a particular neighborhood because such a high percentage of them will reliably vote for them. This year, he said, with young voters, \u201cit\u2019s definitely more complicated. It\u2019s not a blind pull.\u201d Della Volpe\u2019s observation underscores how Trump\u2019s strength among irregular voters could force Democrats to reconsider their tactics. Much of the voter registration and turnout work aimed at minority and young voters has historically operated through liberal non-profit organizations that target the broad population in those groups on the assumption that most of them will ultimately favor Democrats. But this year, some Democratic strategists worry that casting such a wide net could inadvertently mobilize an unusually large number of peripheral voters who favor Trump. That could compel Democrats to switch more of their registration and turnout efforts toward explicitly partisan programs, which can target voters more precisely based on their partisanship, but which are more difficult to raise money for. \u201cYou are hearing more groups struggling because their thesis has been \u2018I take [non-profit] dollars to get, say, all non-White voters\u2019\u201d to register and turnout, said Smith of Civitech. For Republicans, the mirror image imperative is finding ways to organize the irregular Black and Latino voters showing openness to\u00a0Trump. Republicans don\u2019t have much history of courting those voters, and, ironically, any effort to do so may be impeded by the barriers to voting that many Republican-controlled states have erected since 2020. Republicans also face the complication that Trump\u2019s diversion of large amounts of his fundraising toward his legal defense may mean there\u2019s less money available to invest in on-the-ground campaign operations. That may not matter much if the combination of Trump\u2019s ubiquitous media presence and discontent with Biden\u2019s record encourages enough irregular voters open to the former president to turn out in November. Based on the results in 2018, 2020 and 2022, Democrats can feel confident that at least as many habitual voters are hostile to Trump as committed to him, particularly in most of the battleground states that will decide the election. The decisive variable for 2024 may be how many people beyond that inner core of the most reliable voters show up and whether they break for the former president as decisively as most polls now suggest.

The campaign said a quarter of the donors in May were first-time contributors this cycle and pointed to Trump\u2019s criminal trial in New York and conviction on 34 felony counts as a driver of the donations.\u00a0The campaign previously had announced bringing in $53 million online in the 24 hours after his conviction last week, and campaign officials on Monday said that one-day surge accounted for more than a third of the total May haul. The campaign also said that organizations supporting Trump raised an additional $150 million in May. \u201cWe are moved by the outpouring of support for President Donald J. Trump.

His comments come just days after a Manhattan jury\u00a0found Trump guilty of all charges\u00a0in his hush money trial, making him the first former president to be found guilty of a felony and the first major-party presidential nominee to be convicted of a crime in the midst of a campaign for the White House.

{"id": "2024_06_01_politics_polls-trump-verdict-election-biden", "text": "The guilty verdict against Donald Trump in his\u00a0New York hush money trial is a momentous news story in itself. What\u2019s far less clear, and what no polling can predict, is the effect it will have on voters\u2019 willingness to support Trump in the presidential election. That\u2019s not for a lack of data points. A\u00a0number of pre-conviction surveys have already asked questions attempting to gauge the potential political fallout, and\u00a0initial\u00a0post-verdict polling\u00a0provides\u00a0a first look at\u00a0how Americans are reacting to Trump\u2019s\u00a0conviction. But survey questions that ask\u00a0voters to explain how their choices are affected by a news event \u2013 whether a debate performance or a criminal conviction \u2013 are notoriously difficult to answer or interpret, and commonly overstate the potential for movement in public opinion. At the same time, polling also shows that many people weren\u2019t closely following the trial, meaning that any repercussions may not immediately emerge. Combined, these factors\u00a0leave room for considerable uncertainty. An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll,\u00a0conducted during the trial and released before Thursday\u2019s verdict, found 67% of registered voters predicting that a guilty verdict would make no difference to their vote. Fifteen percent said they\u2019d be more likely to vote for Trump\u00a0and 17% that they\u2019d be less likely\u00a0to do so. Among Trump\u2019s current supporters, 7% predicted they would be less likely to vote for him if he were convicted. Sixty-eight percent said they didn\u2019t think it would affect their vote, and another 24%, despite already supporting him, said a conviction would make them more\u00a0likely to vote for him. That comports with other polling taken in the run-up to the verdict, when the idea of a conviction was still hypothetical. It also appears roughly in line with one of the first post-verdict polls. A Reuters/Ipsos\u00a0survey conducted Thursday night and Friday found only about 1 in 10 Republicans saying that the verdict made them at least somewhat less likely to vote for Trump. Of course, many\u00a0voters don\u2019t answer such questions with statements about how likely they are to change their minds \u2013 instead, their responses often demonstrate how they already feel about the candidates. Inevitably, some of Trump\u2019s staunchest supporters will say that\u00a0the conviction makes them more likely to support him, and some of his staunchest opponents that it makes them less likely to do so \u2013 even though their votes were never in play in the first place. Take the\u00a0roughly one-quarter of Trump\u00a0supporters in the NPR/PBS/Marist poll\u00a0who said that a conviction would increase their chances of supporting him over President Joe Biden. While\u00a0the conviction could serve to strengthen their loyalty to Trump, they were already planning to vote for him. And, on the flip side, while 27% of Democrats in that poll said a conviction would decrease their chances of voting for Trump, many of them were unlikely to even consider him. In the Reuters/Ipsos poll, initial post-verdict reactions divided sharply along partisan lines. An overwhelming 89% of Democrats said the prosecution of Trump was \u201cmainly about enforcing laws fairly and upholding the rule of law,\u201d while a similar 87% of Republicans characterized it as \u201cmainly a politically motivated attempt to prevent Trump from returning to the White House.\u201d Overall, Americans said, 52% to 45%, that the prosecution was mainly about enforcing and upholding the law. Voters who aren\u2019t already locked into a decision \u2013 and whose reactions may matter most to the campaigns \u2013 are also among the least likely to have been paying close attention to the trial. In a Quinnipiac poll conducted during the trial, only about one-third of registered voters said they were following the trial very closely, with 38% following it only somewhat closely and 30% not too closely.\u00a0Attention to the trial was particularly low among some of the subgroups most likely to contain persuadable voters: 53% of voters younger than 35 and 41% of independent voters said they weren\u2019t following the story too closely. An April CNN poll\u00a0found that, while most Trump backers said they\u2019d support him regardless of any criminal convictions, the minority who said they \u201cmight reconsider\u201d tended to be younger than other Trump supporters and more apt to describe themselves as politically independent and ideologically moderate. So\u00a0it could take time to see how the verdict and related developments play\u00a0out on the campaign trail. The best gauge of any immediate, tangible effect on voters\u2019 preferences might be polls of the presidential race. They\u2019ve remained consistently close throughout this year, but could the hush money verdict lead to them shifting\u00a0noticeably?\u00a0Even that is complicated. Poll results will naturally see some fluctuation,\u00a0even in a stable race, making any modest effects more difficult to spot, and patterns of poll responses are sometimes temporarily disrupted in the wake of major news. But if Thursday\u2019s decision becomes a lasting inflection point, it should be evident in the Biden-Trump trendline.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/politics/polls-trump-verdict-election-biden/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_01_politics_gaza-pier-israel-hamas-war", "text": "Hours after President Joe Biden touted the success of the temporary pier the military had just constructed into Gaza during his commencement speech at West Point last Saturday, White House staffers learned the pier was at risk of falling apart. By Tuesday, heavy seas and a surprise North African storm had beached four Army vessels and caused enough damage that the whole thing had to be towed to Israel for repairs. \u201cWe were all disappointed,\u201d a senior administration official told CNN,\u00a0adding that up until it broke apart, the pier had performed well enough that officials were preparing to increase the amount of aid delivered over it. The pier represents months of work by officials trying to come up with a way to get aid into Gaza without dropping it out of planes or trucking it through border checkpoints. Even\u00a0though\u00a0it was operational for only about a week, the pier helped deliver some 1,000 metric tons of aid into Gaza before breaking apart. That\u2019s well short of the military\u2019s goal of moving 500 tons of aid per day over the pier. And delays initially stalled distribution of what did make it into Gaza. The pier also came with a significant price tag of $320 million and required 1,000 US military personnel to complete before breaking apart last week. But with air drops having ceased in recent weeks, and the land route into Rafah currently closed, the pier remains a potential lifeline for thousands of Gazans facing a humanitarian crisis. Biden\u00a0officials say they\u2019re optimistic it can be successfully repaired and rebuilt in the coming weeks, but significant questions remain about the pier\u2019s reliability, ones that led the administration to decide against deploying it months earlier. CNN spoke to multiple US officials who detailed the months of planning, preparations and trouble shooting that went into building the pier, as well as the effort underway to repair it and keep it operational. A decade since last use Officials with the US Central Command first brought up the option of building a temporary pier off the coast of Gaza in late October, the senior administration official told CNN. The risks however were deemed too great at the time, with unpredictable winter weather and heavy fighting in Gaza. The pier also didn\u2019t have a great track record\u00a0operating in choppy seas. During a major military exercise in Australia last year, US soldiers\u00a0had to wait\u00a0for a \u201cnarrow window\u201d of opportunity to deploy the pier because of heavy seas.\u00a0They had similar problems during a training exercise off the coast of Virginia\u00a0in 2016. It\u2019s also been more than a decade since the military last used this kind of floating pier, known as a Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore, or JLOTS,\u00a0in a real operation, when it delivered humanitarian aid to Haiti after the devastating 2010 earthquake. \u201cThis is something that we haven\u2019t done in a really long time,\u201d a defense official told CNN. \u201cWe assumed a lot of risk in using a military operation for this purpose,\u201d a second senior administration official added. \u201cWe have done these kinds of operations before but not for this specific purpose, this capability is not typically used in these cases which creates a different dynamic\u201d \u2018These vessels are old\u2019 There are also questions as to how well the Army\u00a0maintains\u00a0watercraft involved in JLOTS\u00a0missions. Speaking to CNN on condition of anonymity, a retired\u00a0warrant\u00a0officer\u00a0who served as a chief engineer on Army watercraft\u00a0criticized\u00a0the capability as a whole, saying that the Army has for years underestimated the difficulty around using the floating pier and does not invest enough resources to it. \u201cArmy boats have not been ready, capable, or in a mindset they\u2019ll have to do something dangerous or in the real world \u2026 for decades now,\u201d\u00a0the\u00a0retired engineer\u00a0said. Another US official\u00a0agreed that the watercraft that perform JLOTS\u00a0missions\u00a0have not been maintained \u201cto the level they need to be,\u201d primarily because \u201cthey lack the funding to get the repair parts in a timely manner.\u201d Those repair parts are also hard to come by. The US official said they\u2019re often not parts you can buy off the shelf like you can for some Army vehicles. \u201cThese vessels are old,\u201d the US official said, adding that even just days before the boats left for Gaza, soldiers were working on repairs on at least one of them. The retired engineer was far more critical, saying rust on the boats is \u201cnot removed, parts are not really fixed, the companies that supply the parts are all out of business so it\u2019s a problem to get replacement parts when you need them.\u201d Asked by CNN if the Army has resourced its watercraft well enough, Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said she believed the Army has invested in it appropriately. \u201cThe JLOTS capability is a great capability and is something I think that can have a lot of utility there, but it was never designed to be able to operate in these high seas,\u201d she said, adding that the state of the sea where JLOTS was anchored is unusual for this time of year but that they are expecting it to calm \u201cin a few days.\u201d Waiting for the weather Before committing to building the pier, the Pentagon had briefed the White House that weather could be an impediment. It did a study going back 10 years to look at weather patterns in that part of the Mediterranean and ultimately determined it was a safe enough bet. The storm that came\u00a0through last week\u00a0wasn\u2019t expected. \u201cThis was kind of anomalous weather incident,\u201d the first administration official said. \u201cSo we knew that it had limitations in terms of the weather but the studies they looked at showed we weren\u2019t likely to encounter them \u2026 during the summer period.\u201d Similar concerns were raised when the pier was first considered last fall. The conversation around a maritime corridor began near the end of October,\u00a0the\u00a0first administration official told CNN, when Cyprus President Nikos Christodoulides surfaced the idea at a foreign affairs council meeting described by sources as \u201cbig picture\u201d but included little detail about who would provide the financing and construction.\u00a0Though the US wasn\u2019t present at the meeting, the White House heard of it through other partner\u00a0nations who were there, including France and the UK, the official said. As the White House began exploring options, officials studied the feasibility of the temporary pier, which was ultimately deemed too risky\u00a0at the time\u00a0because of IDF operations and the weather conditions at that time of year. But that calculus changed in January and February as the\u00a0need for humanitarian aid grew\u00a0more dire.\u00a0US\u00a0officials began touching base with\u00a0their counterparts\u00a0in Cyprus and Israel to explore the logistics including force protection by the IDF and using Cyprus as the staging point for aid. Around that time, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu resurfaced the idea in a conversation with US officials, who then directed the Pentagon to evaluate it again, according to sources close to the matter. A major reservation was the competition for Pentagon resources:\u00a0Along with the hundreds of millions of dollars it would cost, officials knew the project would also require thousands of US personnel to pull off. As officials explored the potential of the pier, the US military\u00a0started conducting air drops\u00a0of humanitarian aid, which provided more than 1,200 tons of food and aid, but also proved dangerous. In early March, at least\u00a0five people were killed\u00a0when airdropped packages fell on them. Weeks later, a dozen Palestinians\u00a0drowned\u00a0off the northern Gaza coast when they swam out to reach cargo that landed in the sea. That month, the White House gave the greenlight for the pier and President Joe Biden announced at this State of the Union address that he was directing the military to lead an emergency mission to build a temporary pier along the coast of Gaza. \u2018Don\u2019t let it happen again\u2019 Despite its challenges, officials are still confident that the pier is a valuable way to continue getting aid into Gaza, where the population is experiencing \u201cfull-blown famine.\u201d Deputy State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said Thursday that it has \u201cbeen an important piece of our overall humanitarian efforts.\u201d Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said Tuesday that it was critical for the people of Gaza to \u201cget whatever aid they can \u2014 by whatever means.\u201d As of Thursday, all of the pier pieces had been towed to Ashdod in Israel where defense officials said they would likely undergo welding and have pins that keep the pier together replaced. But even repairing the pier through welding would be dependent on weather, and increasingly difficult to complete if the seas don\u2019t settle. \u201cImagine welding in \u2018Mad Max,\u2019 basically, you\u2019re standing on the back of a semi going down a highway and you\u2019re trying to weld something precisely. It\u2019s just not reasonable unless you have perfect conditions,\u201d the engineer said. It\u2019s unclear how the military will adjust to\u00a0potentially rougher seas later in the year. Another defense official said there are conversations around removing the pier if bad weather is approaching, though that could require removing it from the beach and then re-anchoring it afterwards. \u201cThe main thing now is, whatever happened, don\u2019t let it happen again,\u201d the defense official said. But ultimately, officials stressed that the answer remains for Israel to open more land crossings, which the administration has repeatedly said is the best way to get aid into Gaza. Deputy Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh emphasized that the solution to aid to Gaza remains the land crossings.\u00a0The air drops, and\u00a0the pier, are\u00a0just additive ways\u00a0to get aid in, she said. \u201cIt is not the solution,\u201d she said\u00a0of the pier. \u201cAnd so I just have to remind you that the best way for food, medical, fuel whatever is needed to get into Gaza is through those land routes.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/politics/gaza-pier-israel-hamas-war/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The rulings from Judge Maryellen Noreika resolved some of the sticking points that were still simmering before the trial begins Monday. Taken together, these decisions could make a tough case for Hunter Biden even more challenging to win. President Joe Biden\u2019s son has pleaded not guilty to illegally buying and owning a gun while abusing illicit drugs. Noreika granted a request from special counsel David Weiss to block one of Hunter Biden\u2019s expert witnesses from testifying. The defense had lined up a Columbia University-based psychiatrist who would\u2019ve tried to poke holes in prosecutors\u2019 assertions that Hunter Biden knew he was an addict in 2018 when he bought the gun that led to his indictment. \u201cThe inadequacy of Defendant\u2019s expert disclosure for Dr. (Elie) Aoun leaves the government in the dark as to what his opinions about the facts of this case will be, thus rendering the government unable to prepare for trial,\u201d Noreika wrote in her ruling. The judge also blocked Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers from using what they thought was a key piece of exculpatory evidence: an altered version of the federal firearms form he filled out when he bought the gun in 2018 that was tweaked in 2021 by the gun store employees. Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers\u00a0recently argued in court\u00a0that they wanted to use the doctored form to undermine the credibility of the employees, who are slated to testify on behalf of the prosecutors. They also claimed it showed prosecutors were politically \u201cbiased.\u201d But Noreika ruled the altered version of the form was \u201cirrelevant and inadmissible,\u201d and she went on to blast Hunter Biden\u2019s team for pushing \u201cconspiratorial\u201d theories and \u201cunsupported rhetoric\u201d about the motivations of the Wilmington gun store employees. \u201cAny probative value it arguably has is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, and misleading the jury,\u201d she wrote, further adding that any attempts by the defense to use the altered form to demonstrate the employees\u2019 alleged political bias would have been \u201cunduly prejudicial and invites (jury) nullification.\u201d Only\u00a0the original form\u00a0\u2013 known as ATF Form 4473 \u2013 will be shown to the jury. On that form, Hunter Biden is accused of falsely swearing that he wasn\u2019t using or addicted to drugs, which allowed him to purchase the gun. Prosecutors contend he was still addicted to crack cocaine at that time, as he has described in\u00a0his memoir.

Trump, who\u00a0faces the possibility of a prison sentence\u00a0after he was convicted last week on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, was asked\u00a0in an interview aired Sunday\u00a0on Fox News about how he had \u201cfamously said\u2026\u00a0\u2018lock her up\u2019\u201d in relation to Clinton but did not jail her when he was president. During his answer, Trump said he had decided that imprisoning Clinton \u201cwould have been a terrible thing.\u201d Then he added: \u201cI didn\u2019t say \u2018lock her up,\u2019 but the people would all say \u2018lock her up, lock her up.\u2019\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cI didn\u2019t say \u2018lock her up\u2019\u201d is false. He called for Clinton\u2019s imprisonment on multiple occasions, including by\u00a0using the phrase \u201clock her up.\u201d Trump often used such rhetoric while criticizing Clinton\u2019s email practices as secretary of state during the Obama administration, which prompted a federal investigation. She was never charged with a crime. During campaign rallies in 2016, Trump sometimes\u00a0paused\u00a0his remarks as his supporters engaged in chants of \u201clock her up,\u201d giving the chants time to continue. On other occasions, he explicitly repeated those words himself. \u201cFor what she\u2019s done, they should lock her up,\u201d Trump\u00a0said\u00a0after the crowd chanted \u201clock her up\u201d at an October 2016 rally in North Carolina. \u201c\u2018Lock her up\u2019 is right,\u201d he\u00a0said\u00a0at an October 2016 rally in Pennsylvania. Trump also explicitly called for Clinton\u2019s imprisonment using different phrasing. \u201cHillary Clinton has to go to jail, OK? She has to go to jail,\u201d he\u00a0said\u00a0in a June 2016 speech in California. \u201cShe has to go to jail,\u201d he\u00a0repeated\u00a0in an October 2016 speech in Florida.\u00a0And at a presidential debate in October 2016, after Clinton\u00a0said,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country,\u201d Trump responded, \u201cBecause you\u2019d be in jail.\u201d Trump\u00a0softened his rhetoric\u00a0shortly after he defeated Clinton in the election, saying he didn\u2019t want to hurt her and didn\u2019t feel strongly about prosecuting her. In his 2020 campaign for reelection, though, he again made calls to \u201clock her up.\u201d \u201cYou should lock her up, I\u2019ll tell you,\u201d he\u00a0said\u00a0at a January 2020 rally in Ohio. At an October 2020 rally in Georgia, after the crowd chanted \u201clock them up\u201d in relation to the Biden family, Trump\u00a0said, \u201cYou should lock them up. Lock up the Bidens.

{"id": "2024_04_10_politics_lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims", "text": "The Republican National Committee last week sent out a scripted call to voters\u2019 phones on behalf of new co-chair Lara Trump saying Democrats committed \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election. It\u2019s the latest example of how the RNC under the former president\u2019s daughter-in-law is perpetuating lies about the 2020 election, even as prominent Republicans say the party needs to look forward to win in 2024. \u201cWe all know the problems. No photo IDs, unsecured ballot drop boxes, mass mailing of ballots, and voter rolls chock full of deceased people and non-citizens are just a few examples of the massive fraud that took place,\u201d the RNC call said. \u201cIf Democrats have their way, your vote could be canceled out by someone who isn\u2019t even an American citizen.\u201d The claim of \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election marks a significant shift in messaging for the RNC because lies about the 2020 election had not been a consistent theme in its messaging since Donald Trump left office. But the call\u2019s message is largely consistent with the views publicly espoused over the past four years by Lara Trump, who was elected as co-chair in early March as part of Donald Trump\u2019s takeover of the GOP. Lara Trump has a long history of echoing his election fraud claims, according to a CNN KFile analysis of her past statements as a commentator and surrogate for the former president. \u201cI\u2019m sure you agree with co-chair Trump that we cannot allow the chaos and questions of the 2020 election to ever happen again,\u201d said the call, which was obtained by CNN\u2019s KFile from the anti-robocall application Nomorobo, which estimated 145,000 calls were sent with the message from April 1-7. It comes amid previous CNN reporting about the RNC asking employees who are reapplying for their jobs whether they believe the 2020 election was stolen in an apparent litmus test for hiring. The RNC denied any such litmus test existed.\u00a0Lara Trump and new chair Michael Whatley succeeded Drew McKissick and Ronna McDaniel, who had earned the ire of the former president because of his dissatisfaction with how the RNC handled claims of fraud around the 2020 election, CNN previously reported. There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, as even some state GOP election officials and former Trump Attorney General William Barr have acknowledged. The former president and his supporters filed more than 60 court cases in six key battleground states following the election and lost every one of them. And, they have still not brought forth any evidence of the rampant cheating they continue to talk about on the campaign trail. But in the years since the 2020 election, Lara Trump has continued to push claims of fraud. Her comments have been in line with those of her father-in-law, who\u2019s successfully reshaped the GOP in his image and easily secured his third-straight GOP nomination this year. Polling, for example, shows that a majority of GOP voters think the 2020 election result was illegitimate. A CNN poll released last September found that 71% of Republicans said President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cdid not legitimately win enough votes to win the presidency.\u201d From November 2020 to February 2024, Lara Trump propagated the narrative of Democratic cheating in the 2020 presidential election. And even after she was elected co-chair and said claims of a stolen election are \u201cin the past,\u201d she didn\u2019t repudiate those baseless accusations. \u201cWell, I think we\u2019re past that. I think that\u2019s in the past. We learned a lot. Certainly, we took a lot of notes,\u201d Trump said in an NBC interview when asked whether claims of a stolen 2020 election would be the official position of the RNC in 2024. She went on to tout lawsuits across 23 states \u201cto ensure that it is harder to cheat and easier to vote,\u201d while raising questions about pandemic-era voting procedures during the 2020 election. In the same interview, Trump also added the GOP needed to \u201ctrust mail-in voting.\u201d Neither the RNC nor Lara Trump responded to multiple requests for comment. A long history of spreading election lies As recently as February 2024, Lara Trump said she did not believe Biden received 81 million votes in the 2020 election. \u201cDoes anyone actually believe that in 2020, 81 million people were so inspired by a guy who could only get 10 people (to attended events) \u2026that he had the most massive turnout in the history of elections?\u201d she said at a Trump event in South Carolina just days before she announced her campaign for RNC co-chair. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t believe that.\u201d On her internet show and podcast, and in public events, she often spread outlandish and nonsensical claims about the 2020 election. On an episode of her show that aired on December 30, 2020, Trump agreed with her co-hosts that the election did not pass the \u201csmell test\u201d and falsely suggested that dead voters helped Biden win. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know if this is true, but somebody sent me this. Donald Trump got 74 million votes. There are 133 million registered voters in the United States. If every single registered voter went out and voted, which we know is basically impossible, doesn\u2019t happen, there would only be 59 million votes left for Joe Biden. So how the heck did he get 81 million votes?\u201d she said. The comments cite a widely debunked analysis that misrepresents the number of people eligible to vote. \u201cYou\u2019re discriminating against all the dead people, Lara. How dare you!\u201d said one co-host. \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s true,\u201d she responded. A CNN analysis previously found no evidence to support this claim, debunking the misinformation spread by Trump supporters online in the aftermath of the 2020 results. The 2020 election saw a record-breaking turnout, with 155 million people casting their votes, as reported by the US Census Bureau. This marked the highest voter participation of the 21st century, with 66.8% of eligible citizens aged 18 and older voting. Later in the episode, Trump said, \u201cI think that [Democrats] know that the Republicans are not gonna let it stand. They\u2019re not gonna certify votes for Joe Biden. And it is likely that they will be voting for Donald Trump for a second term.\u201d In an episode of her podcast weeks earlier, she claimed the odds of Biden winning in swing states were \u201cone in one quadrillion to the fourth power,\u201d as mail-in ballots were counted, failing to cite a statistical analysis. Though Biden narrowly lost with in-person voters, 46% of voters voted by mail in 2020. As votes were counted, Biden pulled ahead, according to an analysis from Pew Research. Though nothing was abnormal or illegal about the process, Lara Trump has also referred to the counting of votes nefariously. \u201cWe gotta make up so much for all the cheating,\u201d Trump said on her podcast in September 2023. \u201cWe know the Democrats love to do that. We need to go into this thing with such a big lead that they\u2019re like, \u2018oh my God, we can\u2019t do a 3:00 a.m. spike with this. We\u2019re never gonna make it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/politics/lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_01_politics_upside-down-flags-trump-conviction", "text": "Hanging the United States flag upside down, a move that is supposed to signal distress and that has ensnared Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito in controversy, is now being practiced by supporters of Donald Trump to protest the former president\u2019s conviction in his hush money trial. Prominent Trump supporters such as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and former national security adviser Michael Flynn posted pictures of upside-down flags on social media soon after a New York jury found Trump guilty Thursday. Flynn, a retired three-star general, made the image his profile picture on X. By Friday, pro-Trump social media accounts were awash with images of inverted flags hanging on porches and lawns across the country. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, posted an image appearing to show the flag hanging upside down above its Washington, DC, headquarters. In California, dozens of American flags that were placed outside a library in Monrovia in Los Angeles County to commemorate Memorial Day were turned upside down overnight Thursday, local news station KTLA reported. It is not clear who was responsible for the stunt.\u00a0\u201cThe city was very surprised to learn someone inverted the flags, which were set up in honor of our community\u2019s veterans. We were able to reset them correctly with the help of staff and community members,\u201d Dylan Feik, Monrovia\u2019s city manager, told CNN on Saturday. The practice of inverting the Stars and Stripes has received renewed scrutiny after The New York Times revealed last month that an upside-down US flag was seen outside the Alito household in January 2021 \u2013 at a time when the practice was a symbol for Trump supporters who falsely claimed widespread fraud in the 2020 election. Justice Alito said his wife hoisted the symbol of discontent in response to a neighborhood dispute. Respect for the flag is outlined in US code, which states, \u201cThe flag should never be displayed with the union down, except as a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property.\u201d Over the weekend, however, the trend seemed to be gaining steam. Country music star Jason Aldean \u2013 no stranger to political controversy \u2013 posted an image of an inverted flag to his 4.4 million followers on Instagram after the verdict Thursday, writing, \u201cScary times in our country right now, man. When a former POTUS gets treated like this by our justice system, what does that mean for the rest of us?\u201d By Saturday, the post had almost half a million likes.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/politics/upside-down-flags-trump-conviction/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_politics_2024-election-legal-entanglement", "text": "The political spotlight of a presidential election entangled in unprecedented legal drama will shift this week from the criminal trial of a former president to one of a sitting president\u2019s son as the campaign enters an intense new phase. Four days after presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump was convicted on 34 counts in his hush money trial in New York, President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter will be called to answer for federal gun charges in Wilmington, Delaware. The trial promises to be a moment of searing personal anguish for the president and comes as he\u2019s seeking to find a political opening after weeks of coverage of Trump\u2019s case. Later this week, the president is expected to issue a sweeping executive action that would dramatically limit migrants\u2019 ability to seek asylum at the southern border. The move, a pivotal moment of Biden\u2019s term and the campaign, will be seen as an effort to blunt Trump\u2019s advantage on an issue that is a foundation of his political career. But it could also risk angering progressive voters who are vital to the president\u2019s hopes of victory in November but have soured on some of his policies, including his support for Israel. Democrats will also seek this week to highlight what they warn are extreme right-wing policies on abortion as the heat of the campaign ratchets up ahead of the first presidential debate, on CNN, at the end of the month. Biden\u2019s effort to seize the initiative in a too-close-to-call campaign will come as the reverberations multiply over the first conviction of a former president and major party nominee. Republicans have mostly closed rank around Trump, claiming that he is a victim of weaponized justice, and the former president\u2019s team and the Republican National Committee are boasting about what they say is a $70 million fundraising spurt following the verdict. Democrats are, meanwhile, debating how to leverage Trump\u2019s conviction, with some calling for a sharper effort to blast Biden\u2019s foe as a convicted felon. It\u2019s too early to tell whether the guilty verdict will have a significant political impact in a nation long polarized by attitudes toward the former president. But a CBS/YouGov poll released Sunday showed that Americans believe 57% to 43% that the Manhattan jury reached the right verdict. And in a new ABC/Ipsos poll, Americans said by a roughly 2-to-1 margin that the verdict was right; however, views of Trump were barely changed from before the jury\u2019s decision. Trump was convicted of falsifying business records to hide a payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. He had pleaded not guilty and plans to appeal. While the charges in the New York hush money case are considered the least politically damaging of four criminal cases against Trump, the conviction represents an ignominious moment for a twice-impeached former president who had previously enjoyed a lifetime of impunity. The trial will resonate throughout the campaign, since Trump\u2019s sentencing is set for July 11, just four days before the opening of the Republican National Convention, and the former president is vowing to turn November\u2019s election into personal vindication over what he inaccurately claims is political persecution by the Biden administration. Trump compares the US to South American dictatorships The Republican embrace of the party\u2019s presumptive nominee \u2014 despite his conviction by a jury of his own peers \u2014 is a remarkable spectacle as one of the country\u2019s two major parties effectively turns its back on the rule of law. The move suggests that in a possible second term that Trump has vowed to use as \u201cretribution\u201d against his political foes, he would be unconstrained by his party and potentially the law. Trump told Fox News in an interview aired Sunday morning that he was a victim. \u201cIt\u2019s weaponization, and it\u2019s a very dangerous thing. We\u2019ve never had that in this country. They do have it in other countries, in South American countries,\u201d he said. His inflammatory remarks did not reflect the fact that his refusal to accept his 2020 election loss and his demagoguery are far more reflective of developing-world banana republics than a fair jury trial. Lara Trump, the ex-president\u2019s daughter-in-law and the RNC co-chair, told CNN\u2019s Kasie Hunt on \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday that Trump had been treated unfairly. \u201cIf his name had been anything other than Donald Trump, this case would have never seen the light of day,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat people are seeing now is that they can\u2019t trust our judicial system. (People) are very worried about the America that we are facing if this is the precedent we are setting in the United States.\u201d Democrats are rejecting the GOP claim that Trump could never get a fair trial in New York because it\u2019s a liberal city. Some key party figures are also seeking to exploit the guilty verdict politically, even as Biden has stayed largely above the fray after saying the verdict showed no one was above the law. California Rep. Adam Schiff, who is running for the Senate, had a simple answer for Trump\u2019s complaints about the jury pool in the city where the former president made his name. \u201cThat jury was selected in part by Donald Trump and his attorneys. They vetted each of the jurors. He had every right that every other criminal defendant has in that courtroom,\u201d Schiff said, also on \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday. \u201cThis ordinary jury of peers found him guilty on every single count. So, if you don\u2019t want to be tried in New York, don\u2019t commit crimes in New York.\u201d Biden spotted with son ahead of his trial The start of jury selection in the first-ever trial of a child of a sitting president could blunt claims by the GOP that the Justice Department targets only Republicans at a time when a Democratic senator, Robert Menendez of New Jersey, is also on trial in New York. The indictment of Hunter Biden was brought by Trump-appointed prosecutor David Weiss, who was elevated to special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland last year to oversee the probe.\u00a0The president\u2019s only living son is accused of illegally purchasing and possessing a gun while abusing or being addicted to drugs, a violation of federal law. He has pleaded not guilty to the three charges. The White House has ruled out the possibility of a pardon, but the president has said his son did nothing wrong and that he has turned his life around after struggles with alcohol and crack cocaine addiction. Hunter Biden is entitled to the same presumption of innocence and a trial by a jury of his peers that Trump was. In a symbolic show of support, the president was seen with his son on a bike ride near his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, home Saturday. While Democrats hope to use Trump\u2019s conviction in their quest to win over independent and moderate voters in the swing states that decide the election, they will also try this week to get more political oxygen for their key campaign themes after the ex-president\u2019s trial dominated headlines since mid-April. As well as Biden\u2019s big immigration announcement, Democrats will seek to train attention on hardline Republican policies on abortion. The Democratic National Committee is, for instance, planning to highlight on Monday a Texas Supreme Court ruling last week that said a medical exemption in the state\u2019s new abortion law applies only when there is a risk of death or serious physical impairment. Democrats say the law is the kind of measure Republicans would seek to implement nationwide if Trump, who built the Supreme Court majority that overturned Roe v. Wade, wins a second term. The ex-president insists, however, abortion policy should be left to the states. Democrats line up abortion attacks In another sign of a widening Democratic offensive on reproductive rights, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York announced he will hold a vote on a \u201cright to contraception\u201d bill Wednesday as Democrats mark two years this month since the Supreme Court overturned the nationwide constitutional right to an abortion. \u201cDonald Trump and MAGA Republicans will not be able to outrun their anti-abortion records, because the American people know that if given the chance, extremist Republicans will not stop in their campaign to strip away fundamental liberties in this country,\u201d Schumer said in a letter to his Democratic caucus. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Sunday previewed how his party is seeking to simultaneously stress Trump\u2019s conviction and autocratic rhetoric while trying to get attention for its own agenda. The New York Democrat said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that a jury had delivered justice in an \u201caffirmation of the American judicial system,\u201d adding, \u201cThis is America. We are not a system that is occupied by a monarch or a king or a dictator. We are a democracy, and in a democracy, no one is above the law.\u201d Jeffries also pivoted to a broader campaign message, arguing that Democrats would lower housing costs and tackle high prices, which are souring many people on the president\u2019s economic agenda. Jeffries said while Republicans were lying for Trump, Democrats would deal with the issues most voters find important. \u201cI\u2019d rather be on President Biden\u2019s side of that contrast than on the extreme MAGA Republican side,\u201d he said. Trump, after complaining bitterly nearly every day that the trial kept him off the campaign trail, is not leaping back into the fray immediately. He is, however, expected to embark on a fundraising swing this week that will include a stop in Beverly Hills, California, on Friday and a rally Sunday in the battleground state of Nevada. In the press release previewing the rally, Trump\u2019s team did not mention his conviction but instead hit an economic message. \u201cWeak Joe Biden and his woke Democrat friends have declared a war on the middle class.\u202fNevadans are suffering under Bidenomics\u202fwith inflation in Nevada,\u201d the release said, also highlighting high gasoline prices. Sen. Tom Cotton, who has drawn buzz as a potential Trump running mate, leaned into the former president\u2019s economic pitch on NBC. \u201cThe real verdict is going to come on Election Day, and it\u2019s going to come from the American people,\u201d the Arkansas Republican said Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be based on things like they can\u2019t pay for their rent and put food on the table for their kids; the border is chaos; we\u2019ve got war all around the world.\u201d The emerging economic argument between the two campaigns shows that Trump\u2019s legal quagmire, despite dominating campaign coverage for months and drawing core Republican voters around the ex-president, may not, in the end, be the issue that decides who will serve as president after January.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/politics/2024-election-legal-entanglement/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_politics_fauci-trump-rfk", "text": "The public lashing Dr. Anthony Fauci faced on Capitol Hill Monday was illustrative of his enduring unpopularity with the GOP\u2019s conservative base. Yet even as Republicans seek to capitalize on that dislike of the infectious disease expert, former President Donald Trump\u2019s past elevation of Fauci is a potential vulnerability as he fights off an insurgent independent campaign from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Increasingly, Kennedy\u2019s third-party White House bid is gaining traction\u00a0by attacking Trump\u2019s Covid-19\u00a0policies. He has, for example, accused Trump of \u201cinventing lockdowns\u201d and has questioned the safety of the Covid vaccine his administration helped develop. Kennedy\u00a0has also jabbed Trump over his reliance on Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who served on the White House Coronavirus Task Force. He recently launched a line of merchandise tying Trump and Fauci together. \u201cVote for Trump/Fauci 2024,\u201d the new campaign shirts say, along with a tongue-in-cheek slogan: \u201cGive us another shot!\u201d Trump has attempted to downplay Fauci\u2019s role in his administration. In an interview last month with Tim Pool, a podcaster favored by the far right, Trump claimed Fauci \u201cwasn\u2019t a big player in my administration like he was after I left when Biden made him the king of everything.\u201d At Monday\u2019s House subcommittee hearing about the US response to the Covid-19 pandemic, Republicans didn\u2019t mention Trump in their grilling of Fauci \u2014 his first public testimony on the Hill since retiring. But Trump\u2019s party increasingly has made Fauci an avatar of the retribution they are seeking if the Republican returns to office. At the macro-level, his supporters have proposed ideas that would make it easier to fire federal workers, like Fauci. Trump has repeatedly suggested he couldn\u2019t fire Fauci during his term because of laws that protect career civil servants. At one point during Monday\u2019s hearing, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia asserted that Fauci \u201cbelongs in prison\u201d over his time leading the country\u2019s pandemic response, a sentiment that has been echoed by other members of Congress and online by other Trump supporters. After the subcommittee chairman, Rep. Brad Wenstrup of Ohio, thanked Fauci for his years of service Monday, Laura Loomer, a conservative provocateur who operates on the edges of Trump\u2019s political operation, posted on social media: \u201cDr. Fauci is a criminal and needs to be treated like one. Not be thanked by the REPUBLICAN CHAIR of the Select subcommittee on coronavirus.\u201d Kennedy has given quarter to these views. In a recent interview, when conservative commentator Glenn Beck asked him, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t (Fauci) in jail?\u201d Kennedy responded, \u201cHe\u2019s not in jail because Joe Biden is president.\u201d Kennedy isn\u2019t the first to use Fauci in an attempt to drive a wedge between Trump and his base. During the GOP primary, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis regularly invoked the longtime public health expert to attack Trump from the right, noting the former president gave Fauci a commendation on his last day in office. Trumped claimed he didn\u2019t know who gave Fauci the commendation, leading DeSantis to joke: \u201cIs this the immaculate commendation or something like that? Did this just happen out of thin air?\u201d But DeSantis\u2019 efforts ultimately failed to make a dent in Trump\u2019s support with the GOP base. While Kennedy faces an uphill climb to get on the ballot in every state, polling suggests he has nevertheless become a problem for Trump as he centers his campaign around vaccines and the coronavirus response. One recent poll from Monmouth University showed support for Kennedy among Republicans grew slightly\u00a0once they learned of his views on vaccines and Covid. It\u2019s just one datapoint, though it explains the urgency of Trump\u2019s recent attacks on Kennedy. David Robertson, a 50-year-old San Antonio\u00a0real estate developer, voted for Trump in 2020, but told CNN he switched to Kennedy after hearing the independent candidate talk about Covid on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast. \u201cI just felt like we were misled, you know, and a lot of ways and a lot of stuff that we were told that wasn\u2019t true, we\u2019ve now found out that it is true,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cTowards the end with Covid, the way he handled it, with the lockdowns and everything else, I felt like he just kind of bowed down to what he was told to do.\u201d In the face of this rising threat, Trump has lately stepped up his attacks on Kennedy, labeling him an \u201cextreme liberal\u201d and \u201cfake anti-vaxxer\u201d in a video posted to social media last month.\u00a0Kennedy is a leading purveyor of anti-vaccine misinformation and has long espoused unfounded views of inoculations that doctors and medical authorities have easily debunked. \u201cRFK\u2019s views on vaccines are fake, as is everything else about his candidacy,\u201d the former president said in the video. Trump has long had a fraught relationship with the Covid vaccine, one of the most consequential achievements of his four years in office. As it became less popular among Republicans, Trump stopped mentioning the vaccine. Amid DeSantis\u2019 criticism and Kennedy\u2019s rise, he started telling crowds he would not give \u201cone penny\u201d to a school that requires students to get a Covid vaccine or wear a mask. In a recent interview with Time, Trump both touted the development of the Covid vaccine through Operation Warp Speed while also declining to say if he would push vaccines so aggressively if given the chance again. \u201cI\u2019ve been given a lot of credit for Operation Warp Speed. But most of that credit has come from Democrats,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd I think a big portion of Republicans agree with it, too. But a lot of them don\u2019t want to say it. They don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/politics/fauci-trump-rfk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_02_politics_senate-democrats-reelection-biden-ads", "text": "Democrats locked in competitive Senate races are leaning into their party\u2019s legislative accomplishments in ads touting investments in infrastructure and manufacturing, as well as the lowering the cost of some prescription drugs, such as insulin. The senators, whose votes sent the bills to the White House, are front and center. But one name is often missing: President Joe Biden, who signed the bills into law. In an election in which most Democrats will be running on reproductive rights and contrasts with Republican leadership, senators such as Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania are emphasizing their roles in advancing key parts of the Biden agenda without mentioning the president. For incumbents, these recent ads are an opportunity to remind voters of their track records. But the spots also highlight the balancing act they\u2019ll have to perform to win crossover votes from independents and Republicans who won\u2019t back Biden. \u201cThey\u2019re following the opinion of their voters,\u201d said Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist. \u201cThese are Democrats who are in swing states where they need to appeal to voters that don\u2019t like Biden, that are maybe pro-Trump voters.\u201d Democrats will need to defend seven competitive seats \u2013 including five in presidential battlegrounds \u2013 and win the White House to maintain the majority in the Senate. Sen. Joe Manchin\u2019s announced retirement has likely taken West Virginia out of contention for Democrats, and Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jon Tester of Montana are seeking reelection in states Trump won by 8 and 16 points, respectively. In the Blue Wall states \u2013 considered must-wins for Biden \u2013 Democrats are defending Baldwin and Casey and an open seat in Michigan. Part of Democrats\u2019 challenge will be defining their record before Republicans can. GOP groups plan to blame inflation on the American Rescue Plan \u2013 Biden\u2019s Covid-19 economic recovery package \u2013 and argue the Inflation Reduction Act, which provided millions in funding for health care and climate change initiatives, didn\u2019t live up to its name. Republicans will also, of course, seek to tie Senate candidates to Biden. \u201cAll of these Senate Democrats endorsed Joe Biden and voted for his agenda more than 90% of the time \u2013 so they\u2019ll be appearing with Biden in campaign ads whether they like it or not,\u201d Mike Berg, spokesperson for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in a statement. Polls show Senate Democratic candidates running ahead of Biden, who has been plagued by low approval ratings and who trails or ties Trump in key states. For months, Democrats have argued the president\u2019s support will grow as voters tune in closer to the election and learn more about his agenda. The Biden campaign pointed to the midterm elections in 2022, when Democrats fought off an expected red wave, as evidence that the president\u2019s agenda is a boon to down-ballot candidates. \u201cFrom lowering drug prices to defending our reproductive rights, President Biden\u2019s record won at the ballot box in 2022 and it will win again in 2024,\u201d Biden campaign spokesperson Seth Schuster said in a statement. There are signs that voters aren\u2019t broadly aware of Democrats\u2019 record. A KFF poll from May found that 52% of registered voters older than 65 were aware the Inflation Reduction Act capped the cost of insulin for Medicare recipients at $35 per month. An AP-NORC poll from April found that about a third of voters didn\u2019t know enough about the Inflation Reduction Act to say whether it had made a difference on climate change, the economy or inflation. \u201cWhether it\u2019s Sen. Casey or any other senator running \u2013 or, quite frankly, Joe Biden \u2013 they should be talking about these major pieces of legislation that they pass,\u201d said Mike Mikus, a Pennsylvania-based Democratic strategist. \u201cOne, because it\u2019s good for this country. But two, and more importantly, voters agree with what they did.\u201d Millions in ads In a recent ad dubbed \u201cEngine,\u201d Casey highlights the CHIPS and Science Act, one of Biden\u2019s biggest legislative wins. The measure, which passed Congress with bipartisan support in the summer of 2022, is aimed at boosting semiconductor manufacturing in the US. \u201cNinety percent of our advanced semiconductor chips were being made in Asia, creating havoc in our supply chains and raising costs,\u201d Casey says in the spot. \u201cThat\u2019s why I worked with Republicans and Democrats to pass the CHIPS and Science Act to produce our own chips right here in America.\u201d Casey, along with Tester and Brown, has also aired ads on his work to pass legislation to help veterans affected by burn pits. \u201cBy highlighting Pennsylvanians\u2019 shared core values, Senator Casey will continue to earn every vote and support Democrats up and down the ballot,\u201d Maddy McDaniel, a spokesperson for Casey, said in a statement. Baldwin, meanwhile, went up with an ad promoting another major piece of Biden record, the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s insulin cost cap. The ad says that Baldwin \u201cstood up to the drug companies and wrote a law capping the cost of insulin\u201d and that \u201cthanks to Tammy, now it just costs $35 a month.\u201d Andrew Mamo, a spokesperson for Baldwin\u2019s campaign, said the campaign\u2019s ads were meant to highlight the work the senator has\u00a0done over the years. Her first reelection ad spotlighted her proposals to promote American manufacturing, which the ad notes were signing into law by both Trump and Biden. Others have focused on a bill to crack down on illicit fentanyl entering the US that she co-sponsored. \u201cVoters aren\u2019t looking for you to change the world, but they\u2019re looking for you to make their lives better. \u2026 And that\u2019s what our ads show that Tammy\u2019s doing,\u201d Mamo said. Ben Wikler, the chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, said he believes Democrats\u2019 unified messaging on abortion, democracy and the contrast with Trump will help all party candidates on the ballot in the state. In addition to reelecting Biden and Baldwin, Wisconsin Democrats hope to gain ground in the state Legislature. \u201cHaving multiple Democrats communicating in multiple ways in multiple places at any given moment about that same vision, agenda and set of values \u2013 that\u2019s what creates the harmony\u00a0you need to make sure that the tune carries,\u201d Wikler said. At times, the candidates communicate the message on the same stage. In January, Baldwin appeared with Biden in her home state at an official event highlighting infrastructure bill funding that will replace a bridge connecting Wisconsin to Minnesota. Last week, after Casey appeared with Biden in Philadelphia as the president visited the state to appeal to Black voters, the senator\u2019s GOP opponent, Dave McCormick, knocked Casey for voting with Biden 98.5% of the time. The ad wars in both states are just getting started. Keystone Renewal, a super PAC supporting McCormick, announced Thursday that it plans to spend an additional $30 million on the race. The group has already spent $3.6 million on ads boosting McCormick\u2019s profile and slamming the Biden administration\u2019s management of the southern border. And as Baldwin went on the air with her insulin ad, her likely Republican opponent, businessman Eric Hovde, released an ad focused on inflation and high prices. \u201cCareer politicians like Biden and Baldwin just don\u2019t get it,\u201d Hovde says as he walks down a grocery store aisle lined with condiments and canned goods. \u201cThey\u2019re making things harder for folks here in Wisconsin.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/politics/senate-democrats-reelection-biden-ads/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_politics_trump-awaits-jury-verdict-analysis", "text": "The mood flips from torpor to high tension in a second on the high-security 15th floor of the grimy old Manhattan courthouse where a jury will resume deliberations on Donald Trump\u2019s fate Thursday morning. Seven men and five women jurors, headed by a foreperson who grew up in Ireland, were deep into a fourth hour of their historic task when they shattered the oppressive tedium of Wednesday afternoon. A buzzer demanding the judge\u2019s attention sounded, suddenly sending lawyers, court staff, police and reporters rushing for their seats. Then Trump arrived from his holding room, tugging heavily on his lapels. The presumptive GOP nominee sported a trademark extra-long tie \u2014 but in gold rather than his \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d campaign trail red. In the end, the alarm did not herald a verdict in the hush money trial that could brand the 45th president a convicted felon. It was a note from the jury asking for a read back of several long and dense pieces of testimony, from former tabloid kingpin David Pecker and the star prosecution witness, Trump\u2019s former fixer Michael Cohen. Their testimony gets right to the question of Trump\u2019s intent in seeking to snuff out scandalous stories about his personal life, which may shed light on the payoff to adult film star Stormy Daniels facilitated by Cohen, according to prosecutors, under his boss\u2019 orders. (Trump has denied the alleged affair with Daniels and pleaded not guilty in the case.) As Judge Juan Merchan and lawyers combed transcripts filled with complex and sometimes seedy testimony, the buzzer buzzed again, with a new request from the locked down jury. Reporters in an overflow courtroom groaned when it emerged that jurors wanted to hear Merchan\u2019s instructions \u2014 which he spent a painstaking hour reading aloud Wednesday morning \u2014 all over again. No one outside the room where 12 citizens mull a defendant\u2019s fate knows what\u2019s really going on. That didn\u2019t stop tealeaf reading on the row of television standup locations across the street. The jury\u2019s desire to wade through testimony suggested that no verdict was imminent \u2014 and that they grasped the magnitude of their duty in a case that is critical to Trump\u2019s reputation and the nation\u2019s future. Even for those armed with the publicly released courtroom transcript, Merchan\u2019s instructions were potentially confusing to the layman. The jury doesn\u2019t get a printout, according to New York law, so it\u2019s not surprising they wanted clarity. CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said the instructions were \u201cway too much for any human being to absorb and make sense of.\u201d The key question at the root of the trial The jury\u2019s requests highlight the big question in a prosecution that is using a novel interpretation of the law to try to hold Trump to account over the 2016 presidential election, which seems a lifetime ago. As Merchan explained, the ex-president is facing 34 charges of falsifying business records. Such an act is only a misdemeanor in New York. To convict Trump of a felony, therefore, the jury must also find that he falsified the documents to hide another crime. Prosecutors are not required to prove a secondary crime took place or even to nail down exactly what it is. In this case, the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office raised the possibility of tax law infringements and the intent to falsify other documents and suggested Trump may have wanted to violate election law using \u201cunlawful\u201d means to deprive someone else of an election win. If the jury \u2014 which sat through days of testimony \u2014 needs more help, the chances of voters with only a cursory knowledge of the case forming their own strong impressions seem remote. Trump\u2019s vigil As Merchan laid out his instructions for the first time on Wednesday, Trump watched from the defense lawyers\u2019 table. He rocked back in his chair and closed his eyes, and just when it appeared he might be snoozing, shook his head contemptuously and grimaced as Merchan read out the 34th charge. At one point, Trump reached inside his jacket and pulled out a pen to write a note to his square-jawed defense lawyer Todd Blanche to his right. When his pen seemed to fail, he reached out a hand and grabbed his attorney\u2019s pen from atop his legal pad so he could scribble a message. He made sure to return Blanche\u2019s pen before returning his own to his pocket. Trump\u2019s confinement at the court all day awaiting the whims of 12 citizens of New York City \u2014 where he made his name as a tabloid-bait real estate developer \u2014 hinted at the extraordinary power imbalance revealed by this trial and his multiple legal threats. Ex-presidents cruise through life in a bubble of deference. Their magnetism lingers along with Secret Service details even after their formal powers are gone. They run on their own time and dominate every room. And Trump has long lived in rarified air, in his skyscraper penthouse, his beach club, on golf resorts boasting super-size fountains and waterfalls or on his personal Boeing. But after weeks in a courthouse built on the site of a former dungeon, Trump can only sit and watch the minutes tick by before he learns if he will enter November\u2019s election as a felon. Still, the longer the deliberations go on, the more hopes will rise in Trump\u2019s camp. They might be clutching at straws, but the ex-president\u2019s allies believe a long wait for the jury could deliver him a more favorable verdict, sources told CNN\u2019s Kristen Holmes. \u201cLook, it was possible the jury was going to come back, guilty verdict in 45 minutes \u2014 every minute after that gives some hope (for a hung jury),\u201d one adviser said. The ex-president\u2019s only way of letting off steam is in a pen outside Merchan\u2019s courtroom, where he stands behind crash barriers in front of a pool of cameras and blasts the judge, the case, and falsely claims the entire process is proof of a plot by President Joe Biden to stop him from reclaiming the presidency in November. Trump\u2019s routine \u2014 aimed at voters as he seeks to delegitimize the case before the jury makes up its mind \u2014 is getting old. One new wrinkle Wednesday was his warning that the jury instructions could doom his defense. \u201cMother Theresa could not beat these charges. These charges are rigged.\u201d The jury hears none of this, so it\u2019s clear Trump is playing an outside political game. The presumptive GOP nominee\u2019s immediate fate is in the hands of jurors who were cross-examined for signs of political bias before the trial began and include a West Harlem man who works in sales, a young female teacher and a speech therapist. Two of the jurors are attorneys and could potentially give deliberations some structure, according to Jeff Swartz, a former Florida judge. \u201cIf the two lawyers agree with each other, that is where the jury is going to go,\u201d Swartz told CNN on Wednesday. Merchan told jurors\u00a0before sending them off to deliberate,\u00a0\u201cYou are asked to make a very important decision about another member of the community.\u201d Despite his fame, wealth and power, that is exactly who Trump is \u2014 just a lonely defendant awaiting a jury\u2019s verdict.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/politics/trump-awaits-jury-verdict-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_supreme-court-trump-what-matters", "text": "Former President Donald Trump\u2019s favorite Supreme Court justices might not even be the three he nominated. Trump congratulated Justice Samuel Alito, who was nominated in 2005 by then-President George W. Bush, after the jurist on Wednesday refused to recuse himself from cases related to the January 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol or the 2020 election. Alito said in a letter to lawmakers that he didn\u2019t know that his wife had raised an upside-down flag in the days before President Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration in January 2021. In any event, the deeds of his wife, Martha-Ann Alito, don\u2019t meet his threshold for recusal. Alito\u00a0also\u00a0addressed\u00a0the \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag \u2013 which some interpret as pushing for more religion in the public space and has also become a symbol for Trump supporters \u2013 that was flown at the justice\u2019s New Jersey beach house last summer.\u00a0He said his wife flew the flag, which dates back to the American Revolution, and neither was aware of its current connotation. But Trump was doing the social media equivalent of a fist pump at Alito\u2019s declaration when he said this on his social media platform: Congratulations to United States Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito for showing the INTELLIGENCE, COURAGE, and \u201cGUTS\u201d to refuse stepping aside from making a decision on anything January 6th related. All U.S. Judges, Justices, and Leaders should have such GRIT - Our Country would be far more advanced than its current status as A BADLY FAILING NATION, headed by the Worst President in American History, Crooked Joe Biden! The Supreme Court is currently deliberating over whether Trump, as a former president, should enjoy some level of super immunity from prosecution. It\u2019s a complicated case, but certainly Alito was one of the justices most open to immunity claims during oral arguments in April. Alito is also the justice who wrote the decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, the landmark opinion that overturned Roe v. Wade and ended a nationwide right to abortion for American women. While Trump has waffled on how to handle the abortion issue now that there is a patchwork of laws across the country, his latest position is to leave the matter up to states, not unlike what Alito suggested in writing the opinion. The actions of Alito\u2019s wife, flying an upside-down flag as part of a neighborhood dispute over the outcome of the 2020 presidential election, are well within someone\u2019s First Amendment rights. It\u2019s also true that the Alitos\u2019  judgment in how a Supreme Court justice should appear objective is suspect. These relatively innocuous, political expressions pale in comparison to the actions of another Supreme Court spouse: Virginia \u201cGinni\u201d Thomas, who in addition to being married to Justice Clarence Thomas (who was nominated in 1991 by George H.W. Bush) is a conservative activist featured prominently in the House January 6 report. She was actively strategizing around the fake elector scheme by which Trump\u2019s allies wanted to upend Biden\u2019s victory. In text messages with Trump\u2019s White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, Ginni Thomas referred to the 2020 election as a \u201cheist.\u201d She later told the January 6 committee she regretted the messages. Unlike Alito, who responded to lawmakers\u2019 calls for his recusal, Thomas has stayed silent on the matter, although it is clear at this point he will not be recusing himself from any January 6-related cases. Read more from CNN\u2019s Devan Cole. The perception of political bias among Supreme Court spouses does not necessarily mean anything about the political leanings of their powerful husbands, although Alito and Thomas form the core of the conservative majority that currently dominates the Supreme Court.

This move doesn\u2019t somehow \u201cerase the years of injustice,\u201d as the documentary \u201cWhen It Was A Game\u201d put it. Rather, including NLB statistics in the MLB ones \u201cserve[s] to remind us of what we missed\u201d by having racially segregated leagues. Indeed, as elite sportswriter Neil Paine pointed out to me, it\u2019s the stats that show us that the NLB was the equal of, if not superior to, its White counterpart. Consider the statistics of when nine White major leaguers from various teams \u2013 who came together under the banner of \u201call-star\u201d teams \u2013 played against teams of Black major leaguers. The NLB players won 51% of the time from 1900 to 1948. This isn\u2019t some statistical fluke, either. We have 180 documented games during this stretch, which is the equivalent of over one season of major league games (162 currently) or more than 25 World Series taken to the maximum of seven games. As Negro League historian Todd Peterson noted when he made his case a few years ago, the Negro Leaguers were the only ones to consistently beat White major leaguers, who dominated squads of semi-pro, college and minor leaguers. The games between White MLB stars and NLB players left a lasting mark on Hall of Famer Dizzy Dean, who had organized a lot of games between White \u201call-stars\u201d and Negro League players. Dean had great respect for the skills of arguably the Negro League\u2019s best pitcher, Satchel Paige, after Dean\u2019s team of White ball players fell to NLB teams on numerous occasions. While players like Paige eventually did join an integrated MLB, he was well past his prime. Fortunately, we got to see other NLB players join an integrated MLB a short time into their careers. Willie Mays was the best player of the second half of the 20th century, according to the all-encompassing stat wins above replacement (WAR); Mays was a member of NLB\u2019s Birmingham Black Barons in 1948. Henry \u201cHank\u201d Aaron was the second-best player, according to WAR, of the second half of the 20th century. The 20th century home run king was a member of the NLB\u2019s Indianapolis Clowns in 1952, after the period where NLB teams were considered major league for stat counting purposes. High-level players and deserved accolades It\u2019s depressing to imagine a world where Mays or Aaron didn\u2019t play in the integrated major leagues, which is true for Black players overall. They quickly became an integral part of the American and National Leagues in the late 1940s, 50s, 60s and 70s. Black players were on average the best players, which adds to the case that the NLB was a major league. Former NLB players who joined the integrated MLB got on base more frequently (.361) than the average (.324). They hit for more power too with a higher slugging percentage (.455) than the average (.380). The same dominance of former NLB players held true for pitching in the integrated MLB. They won more games (55%) than the average major leaguer (50%), gave up fewer runs (with an ERA of 3.76 vs. 3.91) and struck out more players per nine innings (5.91 vs. 4.89). It\u2019s not surprising that the second former NLB player to win Rookie of the Year in the integrated major leagues was pitcher Don Newcombe. In fact, former NLB players won the National League Rookie of the Year every year from 1949 to 1953. The first MLB player to win Rookie of the Year in the integrated league was Jackie Robinson. Sometimes lost in all of the deserved accolades of Robinson\u2019s breaking the color barrier in 1947 was just how good he was as a player in the integrated league. He put together seven of the best seasons ever for a guy who primarily played second base, according to WAR. Robinson did this while not playing a single integrated MLB game until he was 28, when many players\u2019 skills are already declining. Players like Robinson and Larry Doby \u2013 the first American League Black player and Hall of Famer \u2013 were able to perform at a high level, despite having to put up with a lot of racist rhetoric from fans and fellow players. Sadly, some NLB stars never got to play in an integrated MLB: catcher Josh Gibson was one of them. He died before Robinson ever took the field for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. With Wednesday\u2019s news, Gibson\u2019s now credited with being the all-time baseball leader in batting average at .372 and power hitting (with a slugging percentage of .718). Gibson also leads in on-base-plus-slugging (OBPS) at 1.177, which combines getting on base and hitting for power. Ty Cobb had led the first category, while Babe Ruth led the second and the third. Gibson\u2019s great grandson put it best when he told CNN that \u201cnow, the conversation begins where Josh Gibson ranks as the greatest of all time or one of the greatest of all time.\u201d It\u2019ll be a fun debate to compare the power hitting of Gibson and Ruth. We\u2019ll never know how Ruth would have batted if Black players were part of the American League, or how Gibson would have done in regular season competition against White players. But what\u2019s interesting about the MLB is that it was already combining records for two totally different leagues prior to adding the NLB to the record books. The American League (of which Doby was part of) and National League (of which Robinson was part of) didn\u2019t play regular season games against each other until 1997. Cobb never played against a NL squad in the regular season. Ruth only did for well less than half a season, after he was well past his prime. In fact, if you were to look at the leaderboard for White MLB stats prior to integration, you\u2019ll see many players never played the opposing league in the regular season. NL pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander never played against the AL. AL pitcher Walter Johnson never played against the NL. A big reason for that is that it was basically impossible for the AL and NL teams to trade players to each other prior to 1959. The leagues were so distinct that they had different presidents just like the NLB. What today\u2019s MLB did in combining the records of the different leagues \u2013 the AL, NL and NLB \u2013 makes sense and has precedent to some degree. When people look at MLB stats now, they\u2019ll get a truer picture of who was good, great or transcendent, regardless of which league they played in.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/sport/negro-league-stats-mlb-record-books-intl-spt/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_haley-voters-pennsylvania-trump", "text": "Joan London is carrying a 40-year-old newspaper, its edges frayed and turning yellow. She beams as she unfolds it to show a black and white photograph of her earliest political activism \u2014 holding a 1984 Reagan-Bush campaign sign. On her phone, more GOP pride: photos of London at a rally for a Republican candidate for Pennsylvania governor and in Washington, DC, for a Tea Party event during the Obama presidency. \u201cWhen I was 18, I registered as a Republican,\u201d London said. \u201cI\u2019ve been a Republican for many years until a month ago when I changed by registration from Republican to Independent.\u201d Just before the switch, one last ballot cast as a Republican: a vote for Nikki Haley in Pennsylvania\u2019s April presidential primary, even though the former South Carolina governor had bowed out of the race seven weeks earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s time to pass the baton to a new generation in the Republican Party, and I felt that she was it,\u201d London told CNN in an interview. She cast her Haley protest vote, then left Donald Trump\u2019s GOP. \u201cI have a different vision of what conservatism is,\u201d London said. \u201cI came up in the 80s under (Ronald) Reagan. I\u2019ve always had a very positive vision of self-sufficiency and personal responsibility. \u2026 I\u2019m seeing a change more toward populism which carries some unpleasant baggage, which I didn\u2019t see myself as part of. Didn\u2019t see it reflecting my values.\u201d London is hardly alone. Haley garnered nearly 17% of the primary vote statewide this year \u2014 approaching 25% in the suburban collar counties around Philadelphia. More than 155,000 votes in all \u2014 a potentially decisive bloc in a presidential battleground that Trump carried by 44,292 votes in 2016 and Joe Biden won by 81,660 in 2020. Our conversation with London is part of a CNN project designed to follow the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in the battleground states and are critical to deciding the outcome. London is an attorney in Berks County. The shift as you drive northwest from the Philly suburbs is unmistakable. First the farms and silos, then the Trump flags. He carried Berks County by 10 points in 2016 and 8 points in 2020. But even here, Haley received nearly 16% in the primary \u2014 votes Trump can ill afford to lose come November. London\u2019s is all but certainly lost. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself voting for Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself voting for Biden.\u201d For now, her plan is to either skip the presidential line on the ballot or write in a conservative. She knows the math: any subtraction hurts Trump. \u201cI believe we have to send a message that the Republican Party needs to go in a different direction,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a principled position I need to take.\u201d Irma Fralic, too, cast her primary vote for Haley as a protest. \u201cI want a country that is normal,\u201d Fralic said. \u201cI want a country that functions and I want people to be together.\u201d She is the daughter of Cuban immigrants, a staunch supporter of Israel and a Reagan Republican who saw Haley as tough and principled on foreign policy. Now? \u201cI\u2019m not happy with the options, no,\u201d Fralic said. \u201cOne is in court. And the other one is \u2013 I feel bad for him. If he was my father, I\u2019d say, \u2018You might want to reconsider your life.\u2019 I don\u2019t know. And the other one, I would say, \u2018You might want to prioritize your personal problems.\u2019\u201d Our visit to Pennsylvania coincided with Haley announcing she will vote for Trump in November despite significant differences with the presumptive GOP nominee. Haley also said in her announcement last week she wished Trump would make a direct effort to court her supporters. Fralic said Haley\u2019s decision to vote for Trump would not automatically sway her. But she offered this: \u201cThe best way for Trump to reach out to me and the millions who voted for Nikki Haley is to choose her as VP. If that\u2019s the ticket, they have my vote.\u201d London was more muted in her response. \u201cMy respect for Ambassador Haley has not changed whether or not I agree with her choice,\u201d London said in a text exchange. Eyeing Trump, but holding her nose Linda Rooney cast her Haley vote in the primary as a question as much as a protest. \u201cWho are the people in the Republican Party that keep shoving this down our throats right now?\u201d Rooney said. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we elect someone normal? You know, someone who is diplomatic.\u201d Rooney is a registered Republican who voted Trump in 2016 then Biden in 2020. But she has ruled out voting for Biden again. \u201cI don\u2019t trust him with the economy,\u201d said Rooney, who runs a digital communications business from her home in Media, in suburban Delaware County. Rooney\u2019s son serves in the Army. \u201cI\u2019m angry about Afghanistan, about that withdrawal. So, honestly, I can\u2019t vote for him.\u201d Rooney framed her 2024 debate this way: \u201cI can write someone in, or I can just hold my nose and vote for Trump and know that\u2019s only going to be four more years.\u201d Later, in a text exchange, Rooney said, \u201cHaley would be a good VP and possibly keep him in check.\u201d\u00a0Her reaction to the former governor saying she\u2019d vote for Trump was perhaps revealing of where Rooney will end up. \u201cI think Haley is in the same boat as the rest of us who don\u2019t want Trump as our nominee,\u201d Rooney texted. \u201cShe\u2019s just holding her nose earlier than the rest of us.\u201d That Rooney would even consider Trump speaks volumes about her disappointment in Biden. She called Trump\u2019s conduct on January 6, 2021, appalling. \u201cI was angry that Trump didn\u2019t say something,\u201d she said. \u201cThat Trump didn\u2019t stop it. \u2026 So, you know, I just can\u2019t forgive him for that.\u201d She also works as a borough elections monitor and rolled her eyes when told that Trump again recently insisted he won Pennsylvania in 2020. \u201cNo,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cNo.\u201d A veteran who wants anyone but Trump Michael Pesce lives in Bucks County and works in a meat processing plant. He has been a registered Republican for 40 years. \u201cMy first election, presidential election, was 1984,\u201d Pesce said in an interview at his Doylestown home. \u201cI became a Republican when I turned 18 because of Ronald Reagan.\u201d His parents were Democrats. \u201cAt the time, they were, like, \u2018We\u2019re Democrats. We\u2019re not Republicans.\u2019 I was like, \u2018No, no, no, I\u2019m a Reagan Republican.\u201d Pesce is a Coast Guard veteran who voted Trump in 2016 but Biden in 2020. This year? \u201cIf I had my choice, I wouldn\u2019t vote for either,\u201d said Pesce, who backed Haley in the April primary. \u201cBut I will vote for Biden. I will vote for anyone but Trump.\u201d Why? \u201cSo, he tried to overthrow our government, and that\u2019s a problem with me,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cServed in the US military. I just have very strong feelings about what it means to be an American.\u201d Pesce has little patience for those who believe Trump can do no wrong. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear that, Ok, he could be a convicted criminal in a couple of days,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear that he did all these things.\u201d Pesce said he was \u201cgreatly disappointed\u201d to hear of Haley\u2019s decision to support Trump. \u201cI think she is looking ahead four years,\u201d he said. But it won\u2019t sway him. \u201cI\u2019m a Republican. I\u2019m a conservative,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cI think we spend a lot of money on stuff we don\u2019t need to spend money on.\u201d Yet he will vote Biden and hopes many others among the more than 150,000 Pennsylvania Republicans who cast votes for Haley in the primary will do the same. \u201cIf enough of us Republicans can do the right thing, keep Trump out of office, the next four years aren\u2019t going to be perfect,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cBut I think they are going to be better than the alternative.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/politics/haley-voters-pennsylvania-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_michelle-obama-mother-marian-robinson-dies", "text": "Marian Robinson, the mother of former first lady Michelle Obama, has died, according to a statement from the Obama and Robinson families. She was 86. \u201cAs a sister, aunt, cousin, neighbor, and friend to so many, she was beloved beyond words by countless others whose lives were improved by her presence,\u201d the statement from\u00a0Barack and Michelle Obama, Craig and Kelly Robinson, and their children said in part. \u201cShe passed\u00a0peacefully this morning, and right now,\u00a0none of us are\u00a0quite sure how exactly we\u2019ll move on without her,\u201d the statement said. Michelle Obama posted on social media, \u201cMy mom Marian Robinson was my rock, always there for whatever I needed. She was the same steady backstop for our entire family, and we are heartbroken to share she passed away today.\u201d \u201cThere was and will be only one Marian Robinson. In our sadness, we are lifted up by the extraordinary gift of her life. And we will spend the rest of ours trying to live up to her example,\u201d Barack Obama wrote on X. President Joe Biden, who served as Obama\u2019s vice president, and first lady Jill Biden said in a statement Saturday that their family \u201csends its deepest love\u201d to the Obamas. \u201cWe knew Mrs. Marian Robinson as a devoted mother and grandmother with a fierce and unconditional love of her family. With the blessing of friendship, we felt that love ourselves \u2013 with every quiet smile or warm embrace she shared with us,\u201d the Bidens said. Robinson lived with the Obamas during their time at the White House and was often spotted at events with the first family, including handing\u00a0out goodie bags to trick-or-treaters\u00a0on Halloween. \u201cWe needed her. The girls needed her,\u201d the family\u2019s statement said of her move to Washington. \u201cAnd she ended up being our rock through it all.\u201d A native of Chicago \u2013 where she returned after the Obamas left the White House \u2013 Robinson was married to Fraser Robinson, and the pair had two children, Michelle and Craig. Fraser Robinson died in 1991 after a long struggle with multiple sclerosis. Marian Robinson was heavily involved in her kids\u2019 education, according to the statement. The family recalled Robinson as having taught \u201cher children to read at an early age, sitting together as they sounded out words on a page, giving them the strength and confidence to walk to school.\u201d They also highlighted her presence in a historic moment. \u201cOn Election Night in 2008, when the news broke that Barack would soon shoulder the weight of the world, she was there, holding his hand,\u201d the statement read. David Axelrod, former Obama senior adviser, remembered Robinson as \u201cjust a great lady.\u201d \u201cShe was a South Sider through and through,\u201d Axelrod, a CNN senior political commentator, told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on \u201cThe Situation Room\u201d on Friday, adding that during her time at the White House, \u201cshe did not take to the whole celebrity lifestyle.\u201d Instead, Axelrod said, \u201cshe would often slip out of the White House on her own and visit with friends. \u2026 She really wasn\u2019t looking for attention.\u201d Years after the unveiling of the Obamas\u2019 portraits at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Portrait Gallery in 2018, Michelle Obama recalled how impactful her mother\u2019s reaction had been when she took her to the museum after hours. \u201c(It was) quiet and (I was) watching my mom, Marian Robinson, sit at the base of my portrait and look up at it with such a level of awe,\u201d she said when the portraits were temporarily moved to Chicago. \u201cAnd for me, watching her see me in that way meant the world to me,\u201d Michelle Obama said.

{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_kansas-city-chiefs-white-house", "text": "President Joe Biden on Friday congratulated the Kansas City Chiefs on their second Super Bowl victory in two years, joking, \u201cback to back \u2026 I like that.\u201d \u201cWhen the doubters question whether you could pull it off again \u2014\u00a0believe me, I know what that feels like,\u201d the president said, welcoming the team back to the White House. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s doubting you now.\u201d Biden also tried on a Chiefs helmet the team gifted him, prompting cheers from the players and the crowd. After the president wrapped up his remarks, he turned the mic over to tight end Travis Kelce, who recalled last year\u2019s White House visit, during which he jokingly attempted to give a speech at the podium before being ushered away by quarterback Patrick Mahomes. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you all yet again. I\u2019m not gonna lie, President Biden, they told me if I came up here I\u2019d get tased, so I\u2019m gonna go back to my spot,\u201d Kelce said Friday. The visit carried an underlying level of tension not often felt at championship celebrations at the White House. It\u2019s been only a few weeks since Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker, who joined the team\u2019s visit to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, criticized Biden, who is Catholic, and other unnamed Catholic leaders for \u201cpushing dangerous gender ideologies onto the youth of America\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to transgender rights. His commencement address at Benedictine College contained other controversial statements, such as calling Pride Month a \u201cdeadly sin,\u201d bemoaning diversity and equity initiatives, and suggesting women find more fulfillment from getting married and having children than from their careers. \u201cI want to speak directly to you briefly because I think it is you, the women, who have had the most diabolical lies told to you,\u201d Butker, who is also Catholic, said during the speech. Butker\u2019s criticism of Biden and the backlash to his speech led to speculation that the kicker \u2014 who wore a tie with an anti-abortion phrase on it to the White House last year \u2014 would skip this year\u2019s event. Some of Butker\u2019s high-profile teammates have distanced themselves from his opinions even as they say they embrace the three-time Super Bowl champion as a person. Kelce said last week that he doesn\u2019t agree with \u201cjust about any\u201d of Butker said but that the kicker is \u201ca great person and a great teammate.\u201d Mahomes told reporters Butker was a \u201cgood person,\u201d despite \u201cnot necessarily agreeing\u201d with his comments. The NFL has also distanced itself from Butker\u2019s comments, saying through a spokesperson that his views are \u201cnot those of the NFL as an organization.\u201d Butker is not backing down from his comments. Taylor Swift, the global superstar who is dating Kelce, wasn\u2019t expected at the White House on Friday as she continues the Europe leg of her long-running \u201cEras Tour.\u201d Swift\u00a0played a show in Madrid on Thursday night and is traveling on to Lyon, France, this weekend. The White House visit capped a particularly high-profile season for the Chiefs after Swift and Kelce went public with their relationship early in the season. It ended in an accomplishment that hadn\u2019t been done in two decades by an NFL team \u2014 a back-to-back Super Bowl championship, the fourth in Chiefs history and the third in the last five years. The celebrations in Kansas City were tragically brief. On February 14, one person was killed and 20 others were injured in a\u00a0mass shooting\u00a0just moments after the team\u2019s celebratory rally. Two men were charged with murder in the shooting, which started after a confrontation between two groups of people. In his remarks Friday, Biden said that \u201cas a country, we have to do more to stop these tragic shootings before they happen.\u201d Kelce, who had already racked up a storied career that will likely send him to the Hall of Fame when he eventually follows his brother, Jason, into retirement, became a celebrity outside the world of football thanks to his relationship with Swift. While his performance on the field dropped off as compared with his incredible 2022 season, he still played well enough to be rewarded with a contract extension that made him the highest-paid tight end in the league. For Mahomes, the Super Bowl victory over the San Francisco 49ers in Las Vegas cemented the Texas Tech alum as one of the greatest quarterbacks in the game\u2019s history, even though he\u2019s just six years into his career and is not yet 30 years old. He said last year\u2019s visit to the Oval Office was one of the highlights of his career. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve never been to Washington, DC \u2013 I\u2019ve never even got to see from the outside, seeing the\u00a0White\u00a0House\u00a0or any of the monuments or memorials,\u201d\u00a0Mahomes\u00a0told reporters at the time. \u201cAnd so, to be able to be here and see that, and see the history of this great nation that we have, it was really cool for me to just be here and be in the moment, and I don\u2019t think I could ever really imagine it being as cool as it was.\u201d CNN\u2019s Nikki Carvajal, Donald Judd, AJ Willingham, Piper Hudspeth Blackburn, Matias Grez and Keith Allen contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/politics/kansas-city-chiefs-white-house/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_politics_can-trump-still-run-for-president-what-matters", "text": "Now that a New York jury has convicted former President Donald Trump of all 34 felony charges of falsifying business records, the next obvious question is: Can a convicted felon run for president? Definitely. A further question is more complicated: Could Trump, as a felon, vote for himself? Probably. Starting with the easy question \u2026 Can a convict run for president? The US Constitution lays out just three requirements for presidential candidates. They must: Trump meets all three requirements. There is, arguably, another criterion laid out in the 14th Amendment, where it states that no one who has previously taken an oath of office who engages in insurrection can be an officer of the US. But the US Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that Congress would have to pass a special law invoking this prohibition. That\u2019s not happening any time soon. Judge Juan Merchan has scheduled Trump\u2019s sentencing for July 11, which happens to be four days before the start of the Republican National Convention that is scheduled to take place in Milwaukee. It is technically possible, although perhaps unlikely for a first-time offender, that Trump could be sentenced to prison time. CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said most Class E felony convictions, the least serious type of felony in New York, result in non-prison sentences \u2013 often a combination of probation, fines and community service. As a former president, Trump enjoys lifetime Secret Service protection and he will continue to get protection wherever he is, according to Anthony Guglielmi, chief of communications for the Secret Service. \u201cToday\u2019s outcome has no bearing on the manner in which the United States Secret Service carries out its protective mission. Our security measures will proceed unchanged,\u201d Guglielmi said in a statement to CNN. There is also precedent for presidential campaigns, albeit unsuccessful ones, being mounted from prison cells. Eugene Debs, the Socialist leader, conducted his 1920 presidential campaign from federal prison in Atlanta, where he was serving a 10-year sentence for sedition. He had encouraged Americans to oppose the draft in World War I. The Supreme Court, in that case, had affirmed his conviction, arguing he was convicted not for opposing the draft but for encouraging people not to comply with it. The decision keeping Debs in jail was written by then-Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes just a few months before Holmes did a famous about-face on free speech that put the US on course for the way we view the First Amendment today. Thomas Doherty, an American studies professor at Brandeis University, wrote last year about Debs, noting that he remained in prison as votes were cast and counted \u2013 he got nearly a million, more than 3% of the vote. Even after the Sedition Act was repealed, Debs was kept in prison. Then-President Woodrow Wilson refused to issue a pardon. Wilson\u2019s successor and Debs\u2019 rival in 1920, Warren G. Harding, later commuted Debs\u2019 sentence in 1921. And now to the more difficult question \u2026 Can a convicted felon vote? It depends. Trump\u2019s right to vote in Florida in November\u2019s election will depend on whether he is sentenced to a term in prison and if he has finished serving that prison sentence by the time of the election. Each state makes its own rules. Vermont and Maine allow felons to vote from prison. There has been movement in multiple states toward allowing felons on parole to cast ballots. Trump is now a Florida resident \u2013 and Florida voters, in 2018, overwhelmingly backed a referendum to reenfranchise convicted felons. But Republican lawmakers who control the state\u2019s government first delayed and then qualified the reenfranchisement by requiring that felons must pay all fines and fees associated with their sentence. I talked to Neil Volz, deputy director of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, an organization that works to help reenfranchise formerly incarcerated people. He predicted Trump will have little problem voting since Florida actually defers to the jurisdiction of a felony conviction as to whether a felon can vote. In New York, after a law passed in 2021, any convicted felon who is not incarcerated is eligible to register to vote. Read more from the Campaign Legal Center. Even if the judge ultimately tried to give Trump prison time, it is highly unlikely that Trump\u2019s right to appeal his conviction would be exhausted before Election Day. If, somehow, Trump was convicted in one of the two federal criminal cases against him before Election Day, that might be another story. There are other problems for many post-incarceration felons in Florida, as CNN has reported previously, although they would not apply to Trump. For starters, there is no clearinghouse of data about what fees are required. It has led to confusion and kept many people from voting. \u201cThere are still a lot of people who are confused about their eligibility, and that\u2019s why we continue to work with the state and the election professionals to fix the system,\u201d Volz told me. \u201cBecause people need to know whether they\u2019re eligible or not on the front end of the process.\u201d Volz said his group is making progress with the state to make it much easier for people to confirm their eligibility.

{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_rudy-giuliani-election-fraud-disbarment", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani is one step closer to being disbarred. The professional responsibility board in Washington, DC, recommended Friday that the ex-New York mayor and federal prosecutor lose his law license because of his involvement in a bogus 2020 election fraud lawsuit. Giuliani\u2019s law license had already been suspended due to his work boosting Trump\u2019s false assertions about his electoral loss. It is up to the DC Court of Appeals to decide\u00a0whether\u00a0to permanently disbar\u00a0Giuliani. \u201cWe conclude that disbarment is the only sanction that will protect the public, the courts, and the integrity of the legal profession, and deter other lawyers from launching similarly baseless claims in the pursuit of such wide-ranging yet completely unjustified relief,\u201d the attorney discipline board wrote Friday. The opinion follows a trial-like proceeding held by a hearing committee of the board in late 2022, which weighed the ethics charges brought by the DC Bar\u2019s disciplinary counsel. Giuliani was accused of violating attorney conduct rules with a lawsuit filed in Pennsylvania that sought to throw out more than 1 million votes in the state, which President Joe Biden won in 2022. The disciplinary board on Friday agreed with the committee\u2019s findings that Giuliani had likely broken\u00a0the rules. \u201cWe agree with the Hearing Committee that the Pennsylvania litigation was based \u2018only on speculation, mistrust, and suspicion,\u2019\u201d the opinion said. The board concluded that Giuliani had put forward \u201cno facts to support the claims he made and his opinion that election impropriety occurred does not meet the requirements for filing a lawsuit.\u201d Ted Goodman, Giuliani\u2019s spokesperson, said in a statement the \u201crecommendation comes as no surprise as partisan Democrats continue to destroy the credibility of the American justice system all in an effort to beat President Trump and to hold onto power.\u201d Giuliani is one of several attorneys who face professional misconduct proceedings for aiding Trump\u2019s election reversal schemes. Earlier this week, attorney Jenna Ellis\u00a0saw her Colorado law license\u00a0suspended for three years because of her guilty plea in the criminal 2020 election interference case brought in Georgia. John Eastman, who engineered a plot to disrupt Congress\u2019 certification of the 2020 election results, was found\u00a0by a California Bar court judge to have committed\u00a0\u201cexceptionally serious ethical violations,\u201d\u00a0and his license is suspended while the proceedings over whether he should be disbarred move forward.

{"id": "2024_06_03_politics_president-biden-hunter-gun-trial", "text": "In the days and weeks leading up Hunter Biden\u2019s trial on felony gun charges, President Joe Biden made little attempt to distance himself from his son. Instead, Hunter Biden was seen at the White House and in Delaware at his father\u2019s side amid what the president\u2019s allies acknowledge is a difficult moment for both men. They attended a White House state dinner for Kenya last month; marked the ninth anniversary of the death of Beau Biden, the president\u2019s eldest son, at church last week; and cycled together along a trail in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, on Saturday. The president also planned to spend most of Monday in Wilmington, where jury selection for the trial \u2013 the first of a sitting US president\u2019s child \u2013 is underway. He traveled there\u00a0Sunday evening, arriving earlier than originally planned. As proceedings were getting underway, first lady Jill Biden \u2014 who, like her husband, has remained supportive and protective of Hunter amid his addiction and legal problems \u2014 was seen arriving at the courthouse. \u201cI am the President, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today,\u201d the president said in a statement Monday. \u201cHunter\u2019s resilience in the face of adversity and the strength he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us. A lot of families have loved ones who have overcome addiction and know what we mean,\u201d he went on. \u201cAs the President, I don\u2019t and won\u2019t comment on pending federal cases, but as a Dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength. Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support.\u201d Hunter Biden, 54, is accused of illegally purchasing and possessing a gun while abusing or being addicted to drugs, a violation of federal law. He pleaded not guilty to the three charges, though he has been open about\u00a0his struggles\u00a0with alcohol and crack cocaine addiction. For the president, the legal problems facing his son have been reason to pull him close, rather than push him away. Joe Biden has paid little mind to some of his allies who question the approach. Instead, his concern for his son\u2019s well-being surpasses any potential political fallout, advisers have said. That concern has appeared at moments to be all-consuming, including in the darkest moments of Hunter Biden\u2019s addiction, when the president and his family desperately sought to head off a self-destructive cycle. Joe Biden still speaks with or texts with his son almost daily, particularly as his legal issues mounted. The president told an interviewer last year his son had done \u201cnothing wrong,\u201d and that the only way Hunter Biden\u2019s legal issues were affecting his presidency was in creating a surge of fatherly pride. \u201cIt impacts my presidency by making me feel proud of him,\u201d he said on MSNBC. As the gun trial gets underway, Biden will be heading overseas to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day. There is little question he will remain in regular touch with his son while abroad and will keep abreast of the trial amid a heavy schedule of commemorations, speeches and a state visit in Paris with French President Emmanuel Macron. But neither he nor the White House is expected to speak proactively about the trial. Hunter Biden\u2019s legal team generally operates separately from the president and his campaign, and there are few who believe there would be much benefit in the president weighing in publicly. Prosecutors have said they plan to call about a dozen witnesses for their case. Most notably, they\u2019ve\u00a0lined up testimony\u00a0from three of Hunter Biden\u2019s former romantic partners to testify about his drug use around the time he bought the gun. This includes his ex-wife,\u00a0Kathleen Buhle, and his late brother\u2019s widow,\u00a0Hallie Biden, whom Hunter Biden later dated. Their testimony could bring to life a period that Hunter Biden has described as his rock bottom, during which he was almost always on drugs or trying to get drugs. At his attempted plea hearing last year, Hunter Biden testified that he has been sober since May 2019. There was a time last summer when the president and his orbit believed Hunter Biden\u2019s legal ordeal would end with a plea deal and that the family would be able to close a dark chapter. Those hopes were dashed when the agreement fell apart and, weeks later, a special counsel was appointed to oversee the investigation into the president\u2019s son, opening the prospect of prolonged legal battles overlapping with Joe Biden\u2019s run for reelection. But many in Biden\u2019s orbit suggest his son\u2019s legal issues will not be a driving concern for voters heading into November\u2019s election. Still, few issues are more sensitive inside the Biden White House than the president\u2019s son, from his addiction battles to his legal woes. That has largely left Hunter Biden and his team to go on their own offense, accusing Republicans and others of trying to use his addiction issues for political profit. \u201cThey are trying to, in their most illegitimate way, but rational way, they\u2019re trying to destroy a presidency,\u201d\u00a0Hunter\u00a0Biden said in a podcast released late last year. \u201cAnd so, it\u2019s not about me, and \u2026 what they\u2019re trying to do is they\u2019re trying to kill me, knowing that it will be a pain greater than my father could be able to handle and so therefore destroying a presidency in that way.\u201d CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misidentified a potential prosecution witness.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/politics/president-biden-hunter-gun-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_benjamin-netanyahu-joint-address-congress", "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accepted an invitation from US congressional leaders\u00a0to\u00a0address a joint meeting of Congress, his office said in a statement Saturday. \u201cI am very moved to have the privilege of representing Israel before both Houses of Congress and to present the truth about our just war against those who seek to destroy us to the representatives of the American people and the entire world,\u201d Netanyahu said. The top four US congressional leaders on Friday formally invited Netanyahu to address a joint meeting of Congress. \u201cWe join the State of Israel in your struggle against terror, especially as Hamas continues to hold American and Israeli citizens captive and its leaders jeopardize regional stability,\u201d the letter from House Speaker Mike Johnson, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell reads. \u201cFor this reason, on behalf of the bipartisan leadership of the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate, we would like to invite you to address a Joint Meeting of Congress.\u201d The letter, which does not provide a date for the address, is signed by the top Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate. The invitation comes\u00a0after much\u00a0speculation\u00a0as additional military aid to Israel remains in question and Democrats are facing pressure from their left wing as the party remains divided over Israel\u2019s handling of the war against Hamas. President Joe Biden on Friday laid out a three-phase proposal Israel has submitted to wind down the grinding crisis in Gaza. Claiming that \u201cHamas no longer is capable of carrying out another October 7,\u201d Biden made the argument that Israel has met its stated goals for its operation in Gaza and that the time has\u00a0arrived to stop the fighting as part of a deal to release\u00a0Israeli hostages held by Hamas. Less than an hour after Biden detailed the Israeli proposal,\u00a0Netanyahu\u2019s office\u00a0insisted Israel would not end the war until Hamas is defeated and \u201call of its goals are achieved.\u201d CNN previously reported that during a closed-door conference meeting in March, House Republicans raised the idea of inviting Netanyahu. Following the meeting, Johnson told reporters that \u201cit\u2019s one of the things that we have in mind,\u201d adding that \u201cit\u2019s very important for us to show solidarity and support for Israel right now.\u201d This story and headline have been updated with new information.

{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_trump-conviction-consequences-analysis", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s first act on becoming a convicted criminal was to launch a raging new attack on the rule of law, laying bare the gravity of the choice awaiting America\u2019s voters. In one sense, Trump\u2019s conviction on all counts in his first criminal trial affirmed the principle on which the United States is founded \u2014 that everyone is equal and that no one, not even a billionaire and former and possibly future president, enjoys impunity. But Trump\u2019s authoritarian outburst minutes after the guilty verdict in New York and a race by top Republicans to join his assault on the justice system underscore how threatened those bedrock values now are. \u201cThis was a rigged, disgraceful trial. The real verdict is going to be November 5, by the people, and they know what happened here and everybody knows what happened here,\u201d Trump said minutes after a jury foreperson announced he was guilty on 34 felony charges of falsifying business records to hide a hush money payment to an adult film star. After returning to Trump Tower and greeting supporters with a clenched fist, Trump issued a written statement that made clear that he views his own fate and the nation\u2019s as indistinguishable \u2014 a familiar hallmark of a dictatorial leader. \u201cI\u2019m a very innocent man, and it\u2019s okay, I\u2019m fighting for our country. I\u2019m fighting for our Constitution. Our whole country is being rigged right now,\u201d Trump wrote. President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign echoed his opponent\u2019s belief that the ultimate judgment on the former president will come in the general election. \u201cToday\u2019s verdict does not change the fact that the American people face a simple reality,\u201d said campaign communications director Michael Tyler. \u201cThere is still only one way to keep Donald Trump out of the Oval Office: at the ballot box. Convicted felon or not, Trump will be the Republican nominee for president,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cThe threat Trump poses to our democracy has never been greater.\u201d A moment of personal anguish with national consequences Trump\u2019s conviction by a unanimous New York jury was the most painful low of a tumultuous life of denying accountability that has seen financial boom and bust, three marriages, television stardom, frequent brushes with the law, the triumph of his outsider 2016 election win, a norm-shattering presidency and an attempt to destroy democracy to stay in power after losing in 2020. Judging by his red-faced shock outside the courtroom, the verdict was a moment of personal anguish. Given that he\u2019s got a good chance of being the next president, it is sure to become a grave national test as well. Trump had pleaded not guilty in a trial that is one of four criminal cases entangled with the 2024 presidential election and the only one likely to see a jury before the election. Responses to any motions from the defense in the hush money case are due by June 27 \u2014 the day of the first presidential debate, hosted by CNN. Trump\u2019s sentencing hearing is set for July 11, just days before he\u2019ll secure the nomination at the Republican National Convention and around when he\u2019s said he\u2019d announce his vice presidential pick. Already, his legal defenses have morphed with his political strategy in a narrative of political persecution, and he is vowing that he will devote a possible second term to \u201cretribution\u201d against his foes. Among an electorate that Trump has constantly polarized, the verdict is likely to be greeted with fury by his supporters and jubilation by his critics. But in truth, this is a somber and even tragic passage of US history. Americans have never seen an ex-president convicted of a crime, and a country already torn apart by bitter political and cultural polarization is likely in for a rocky time. The implications are enormous. They begin with the potential consequences for an election in five months that could be decided by the shift of just a few thousand votes in a few states. Trump has been preparing voters for months for the possibility that he would be found guilty in a case that prosecutors said centered around a bid to mislead voters in 2016. He\u2019s claimed his four criminal indictments are a plot by Biden to destroy him. In essence, he\u2019s been working to shatter his greatest norm yet \u2014 the idea that it would be unthinkable for a felon to serve as president. No one can know how voters will react to Trump\u2019s latest moment of ignominy. His conviction will certainly energize his loyal base and his campaign will try to create a backlash to the verdict among more moderate voters. If they succeed, Thursday could come to be remembered as the day Biden lost the election. Or, the guilty verdict could play into Biden\u2019s campaign theme that his predecessor is too corrupt and extreme to serve as president again. Moderate and suburban voters whom Trump has always struggled to attract could be further alienated. But Trump\u2019s tactics and his capacity to shape the views of his supporters \u2014 with the aid of the conservative media machine \u2014 will inevitably mean that the legal system will join the electoral system as another essential institution of American governance that is now viewed as illegitimate by millions of citizens. And if it is Trump who raises his hand to swear to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution on January 20 as the 47th president, America will be led by a criminal whose duties will include being the symbolic head of the justice system. The danger is acute because with his attempt to stay in power after losing the 2020 election, Trump has already shown he will do what it takes to save himself, even if his actions catastrophically hurt democratic institutions. Profound reverberations of the Trump trial verdict CNN presidential historian Timothy Naftali said Thursday that Trump\u2019s call to arms for a campaign against the legal system will mean that every Republican will be forced to put it at the center of their 2024 campaigns. \u201cThat is going to create, in my view, a torrent of poison that will be likely worse than we saw in the \u2018Stop the Steal\u2019 campaign that preceded January 6. And that is going to further unsettle an already sensitive country,\u201d Naftali said. \u201cI worry about it because the \u2018Stop the Steal\u2019 campaign created widespread doubt about the honesty of our electoral system and led many people to believe that fraud had been committed in 2020.\u201d A question that long hovered over this trial is whether the crime \u2014 falsifying financial records to hide a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels to mislead voters in 2016 \u2014 was sufficiently serious for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg to risk the extraordinary political consequences of indicting an ex-president. Prosecutors\u2019 use of Trump\u2019s former fixer Michael Cohen as their star witness, despite his own conviction on tax charges and for lying to Congress, was deeply controversial. Trump\u2019s lawyer Todd Blanche told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins Thursday that the timing of the trial \u2014 in the middle of an election campaign \u2014 was unfair to the ex-president. But the charges were not just cooked up by prosecutors as Trump claimed. They were brought by a grand jury. The ex-president was offered the presumption of innocence until proven guilty, and he was judged by a jury of his peers. Even now, the Constitution he claims has been hijacked will protect him with a full array of appeals, as in all of his other criminal cases. But once a jury has delivered a verdict, justice is considered served. So the immediate Republican attacks on the judge, the court and the verdict represent an extraordinary effort by one of the country\u2019s two major political parties to turn against the integrity of the legal system. The GOP is showing \u2014 after failing to convict Trump in two impeachments and after many of its most prominent members repeated his lies about the 2020 election \u2014 that there is nothing that he can do that will sever the party\u2019s cult-like embrace of its leader. This suggests that any Trump second term would feature even fewer constraints than his wild first one. And it raises questions about his claim to be running a \u201claw and order\u201d campaign. One of the first Republicans to react was New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, the House GOP conference chair who is seen as a possible Trump vice presidential pick. \u201cToday\u2019s verdict shows how corrupt, rigged, and un-American the weaponized justice system has become under Joe Biden and Democrats,\u201d Stefanik said. \u201cFrom the start, the weaponized scales of justice were stacked against President Trump.\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson, who traveled to support Trump during his trial and helped to fuel false claims of electoral fraud in 2020, brought the symbolic weight of his office to support Trump and attack the legal system. \u201cToday is a shameful day in American history. Democrats cheered as they convicted the leader of the opposing party on ridiculous charges, predicated on the testimony of a disbarred, convicted felon. This was a purely political exercise, not a legal one,\u201d the Louisiana Republican claimed. Another top Trump ally, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, said there was never a chance of a fair trial in a city which drew its jury pool from one of the most liberal areas in America. \u201cThis verdict says more about the system than the allegations. It will be seen as politically motivated and unfair, and it will backfire tremendously on the political Left,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThis is a mockery of justice.\u201d Graham\u2019s comment promoted an idea that\u2019s taken hold among conservatives that a Republican leader can only get a fair trial if they are judged in a jurisdiction where they are popular \u2014 a proposition that would effectively permanently politicize justice. One Republican who refused to join the rush to trash the verdict is former \ufeffMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who\u2019s running for Senate. \u201cAt this dangerously divided moment in our history, all leaders\u2014regardless of party\u2014must not pour fuel on the fire with more toxic partisanship,\u201d Hogan said in a statement ahead of the verdict being announced. Chris LaCivita, a senior adviser to Trump\u2019s campaign wrote on X: \u201cYou just ended your campaign.\u201d Hogan\u2019s comment would once have been a standard Republican reaction to the conviction of a top-level politician. In another age, a guilty verdict would have immediately ended Trump\u2019s campaign. The fact that the newly convicted criminal is already using it as a springboard to power speaks to volatile days ahead. \u201cThis verdict shows two different things,\u201d Naftali said. \u201cThe first is that the former president can be indicted and found guilty by a group of his peers. And that shows the strength of our system. The other verdict, though, hasn\u2019t come in and the other verdict is, can the powerful use our political system to escape the consequences of being found guilty? And that verdict is in November.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/politics/trump-conviction-consequences-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_04_09_politics_rfk-jr-campaign-official-january-6-trump", "text": "A New York-based campaign official for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. who raised the possibility that voting for the independent presidential candidate would help Donald Trump defeat President Joe Biden previously promoted false claims that the 2020 election was rigged\u00a0and attended \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rallies after the election,\u00a0including\u00a0the rally on January 6, 2021, in Washington, DC, that preceded the deadly riot at the US Capitol. Rita Palma, who has identified herself as the Kennedy campaign\u2019s state director in New York, also\u00a0repeatedly called\u00a0Trump her \u201cfavorite president,\u201d according to tweets along with comments she posted on\u00a0the conservative social media site Parler that have since been made private. According to a KFILE examination of those now-private posts, Palma also posed for a photo at the former Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, alongside Sidney Powell \u2013 the pro-Trump attorney who pleaded guilty in Georgia\u2019s election subversion case. In February 2021,\u00a0Palma tweeted her support\u00a0for Trump as a presidential candidate in 2024 and even asked whether he could run for a third term in 2028 \u2013 which is not constitutionally allowed as a president can serve only two full terms. \u201c#Trump2024 Can he run in 2028 too?\u201d she tweeted, posting a meme that said she would vote for\u00a0Trump in 2024. In one comment, Palma dismissed suggestions from then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that Trump was to blame for violence at the Capitol. \u201cActually the fault lies with the rigged election. Genius,\u201d she\u00a0wrote\u00a0the day after the riot. There is no indication Palma went to the Capitol or was violent on January 6, but tweets from that day show her in DC for Trump\u2019s rally. Palma later dismissed that day\u2019s violence as the work of a few attendees. \u201cJan 6 was not a riot. A small group of people were trouble. It was 99.9 peaceful, respectful. I was there,\u201d\u00a0she wrote. CNN reviewed Palma\u2019s now-private tweets on the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, where\u00a0she included the hashtag #BidenCheated 86 times from November 2020 to February 2021. Palma\u2019s promotion and attendance at \u201cStop the Steal\u201d events after the 2020 election reflects a segment of support Kennedy has received from Trump supporters, particularly as a means of helping the former president retake the White House in 2024. One of the\u00a0biggest donors\u00a0to Kennedy\u2019s super PAC, Timothy Mellon, is also a major donor to Trump. And polls have suggested Kennedy could take critical votes away from Biden. CNN\u00a0was first to report\u00a0that Palma told a gathering of New York state Republicans that efforts to put Kennedy on the ballot in New York would help \u201cget rid of Biden,\u201d which she called her \u201cNo. 1 priority.\u201d \u201cThe only way that Trump can even, remote possibility of taking New York is if Bobby is on the ballot. If it\u2019s Trump vs. Biden, Biden wins. Biden wins six days, seven days a week. With Bobby in the mix, anything can happen,\u201d Palma said in a video of the meeting viewed by CNN. \u201cThe only way for him, for Bobby, to shake it up and to get rid of Biden is if he\u2019s on the ballot in every state, including New York,\u201d she continued. The Kennedy campaign has since distanced itself from Palma. Amaryllis Fox,\u00a0Kennedy\u2019s campaign director, said in a statement posted on X that Palma was hired by the campaign as a ballot-access consultant and that she doesn\u2019t shape electoral strategy, adding that Palma\u2019s remarks in a circulated video were made as a private citizen. Palma did not respond to a CNN request for comment\u00a0but on Tuesday afternoon posted to her Facebook page: \u201cWow- look at that news cycle. I guess the MSM doesn\u2019t like little ole me exercising my 1A rights? Hi, CNN!\u201d Tweets dating to November 2020 show Palma repeatedly volunteering to go to and attending numerous pro-Trump rallies and events \u2013\u00a0even tweeting at\u00a0\u201cStop the Steal\u201d organizer Ali Alexander she would go to Georgia for a week as the state was recounting votes. \u201cWe are rooting for you\u00a0@realDonaldTrump\u00a0Bigly. YUGE rooting. Biggest fan club EVER. #WeLoveYou\u00a0#BestPresidentEver45\u00a0\u00a0#FourMoreYears,\u201d she wrote on November 19, 2020. Palma also\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0expressed\u00a0an affinity for Powell, one of Trump\u2019s election lawyers who\u00a0promoted\u00a0unhinged conspiracy theories\u00a0about nationwide vote-rigging and who filed meritless lawsuits to overturn the results. \u201cYou were born/ chosen for this fight and you will win, win, win. WE LOVE YOU, TOO!\u201d she\u00a0tweeted at\u00a0Powell. In another\u00a0tweet on December 11, 2020,\u00a0Palma called Powell \u201cMY PERSON OF THE DECADE!!\u201d and posted a photo of the pair at the former Trump International Hotel in DC. Last year, Powell\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0in the Georgia election subversion case, in which Trump and a host of co-defendants are accused of orchestrating a broad conspiracy aimed at overturning Biden\u2019s 2020 electoral win in the state.

{"id": "2024_06_01_politics_recap-trump-hush-money-trial", "text": "Former President Donald Trump was convicted this week of 34 counts of felony business fraud in connection with hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 presidential election. Trump will be sentenced on July 11 and has pledged to appeal the conviction. The guilty verdict, while a major political moment, does not prevent Trump from continuing his presidential campaign nor from serving should he win the White House. Here\u2019s how we got here and what\u2019s next: The indictment Trump was indicted in March 2023 by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, on 34 charges tied to the hush money payments. The indictment alleged that Trump was a part of an illegal conspiracy to\u00a0undermine\u00a0the integrity of the 2016 election. While hush money payments are not illegal in themselves, each charge was tied to a specific allegedly false entry among the financial records of the Trump Organization. Trump has argued that the payments to Michael Cohen, his former fixer who paid Daniels, were correctly labeled as legal expenses. Key witnesses and evidence The physical evidence was key. Prosecutors showed checks and ledgers demonstrating payments from Trump\u2019s company to his former attorney, including a handwritten note outlining a payment plan for Cohen. CNN\u2019s Way Mullery has a great look at the documents here. David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, testified that his company worked with Cohen on Trump\u2019s behalf to squash unflattering stories during the 2016 election. He also spoke about putting up the money to catch-and-kill the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal\u2019s story about an alleged affair with Trump, and about Trump\u2019s anger when the story went public in 2016 and 2018. Daniels, the adult film star who allegedly had an affair with Trump (he continues to deny it), testified about her encounter with him at a golf tournament in 2006, often in explicit detail. Defense attorneys accused Daniels of fabricating the story to make money. Cohen walked jurors through how he worked with Pecker on Trump\u2019s behalf and testified that Trump was aware and approved of how Cohen would be falsely repaid for the 2016 payment to Daniels of $130,000 as legal services. Cohen\u2019s credibility as a convicted felon and perjurer was key during closing arguments, where Trump\u2019s lawyers said Cohen couldn\u2019t be trusted while prosecutors said jurors should use his testimony as part of the larger theme along with the physical evidence. The judge also explicitly told jurors that Trump could not be convicted based solely on Cohen\u2019s testimony. Trump did not testify. The judge instructed the jury that Trump\u2019s decision must not be used as a factor in their deliberations. The gag order Early on, Judge Juan Merchan put Trump under a gag order, later expanding it and fining the defendant a total of $10,000 for various violations. After he was barred from making statements about witnesses, jurors, prosecutors, court staff and the family members of prosecutors and court staff, Trump launched a series of posts on his social media platform. The gag order did not cover remarks about District Attorney Alvin Bragg or the judge or his family, but it was later modified to include family members. Trump railed against the gag order every day during the trial and again on May 31 when he spoke at Trump Tower the day after the verdict. It remains in effect. Sentencing and appeal The 34 charges against the former president are Class E felonies, the lowest level in New York law. As a first-time offender, Trump is unlikely to face any prison time. However, that\u2019s up to Merchan, who will sentence Trump on July 11. Trump, however, has said he will appeal. The typical appeals process for a convicted defendant in New York state can take almost a year or more, but a defendant can\u2019t appeal until after sentencing. After that, Trump will have 30 days to file a notice of appeal. His team would then typically have six months to complete procedural requirements\u00a0such as filing their appellate argument as well as filing other relevant documents like the trial transcripts. After more filings from each side, a five-judge panel for the Appellate Division First Department would then hear oral arguments from both sides and issue a written decision, which could take months.\u00a0The panel is not subject to a deadline. Trump could also go up to the Court of Appeals, New York\u2019s highest court. At the same time, Trump could\u00a0ask Merchan to stay his sentence until after his appeal is over. And if Merchan rejects that request, Trump could ask the appeals court for a stay of his sentence while he appeals. The big question: Can Trump win the White House? The legal answer is that yes, he is absolutely eligible to run. Trump meets the basic constitutional criteria. He\u2019s a natural-born citizen of over 35 years old and has lived in the US for at least 14 years. The political answer is that we\u2019ll have to wait and see. Trump\u2019s campaign claimed it raised almost $53 million in the 24 hours following the verdict (those numbers must be confirmed in FEC filings), and Republicans from up and down the political spectrum came out in support of the GOP\u2019s likely nominee. What about his other cases? Trump is still facing 54 charges in three other cases, but he has been successful in putting those cases on ice with a never-ending barrage of legal filings and appeals. No other trial dates are pending. The federal election subversion criminal case in Washington, DC, has been on hold while the\u00a0US\u00a0Supreme Court considers Trump\u2019s claims of presidential immunity. The judge overseeing his classified documents case in Florida has indefinitely postponed the trial and continues to schedule hearings on various legal issues. And the Georgia election interference case is in legal limbo while Trump and several of his co-defendants try to disqualify the Atlanta-area prosecutor who brought the charges. What else? Can Trump buy guns? Travel? A flood of questions came in this week from CNN readers asking about everything from Trump\u2019s eligibility to vote, his ability to travel abroad or his right to buy firearms. CNN\u2019s\u00a0Zachary B. Wolf\u00a0and\u00a0Devan Cole answered them all here. CNN\u2019s Kara Scannell, Lauren del Valle, Jeremy Herb, Zachary B.

{"id": "2024_06_02_politics_donald-trump-joins-tiktok", "text": "Former President Donald Trump has joined TikTok, the fast-growing social media platform with ties to China that Trump has publicly embraced even though he railed against it as president. In his first post on the social network, which is filled with young potential voters, Trump posted a video after he attended an Ultimate Fighting Championship match in Newark, New Jersey, earlier in the evening. UFC CEO Dana White is featured in the video. Trump addressed viewers directly, saying it was an \u201chonor\u201d to be on the app. His message was followed by a montage of cheering UFC fans. \u201cThe president is now on TikTok,\u201d White said at the start of the video. Trump\u2019s\u00a0account, which carries a verified badge, currently contains just that single post. His super PAC, MAGA Inc., previously joined the platform in May. The PAC\u2019s CEO, Taylor Budowich,\u00a0posted\u00a0on X at the time, \u201cMAGA INC will not cede any platform to Joe Biden and the Democrats who are trying to destroy our country. We will ensure President Trump\u2019s America First agenda is brought to every corner of the internet and every precinct of this country.\u201d The move to join TikTok underscores Trump\u2019s recent about-face on the platform that\u2019s popular with 170 million people in the United States. It remains smaller than competitors like Instagram and Facebook, but TikTok is faster-growing and trends younger. Although Trump may be new to TikTok, many of his supporters are not, according to a TikTok official, familiar with the platform\u2019s user sentiments. Compared to Trump opponents, \u201cTrump\u2019s supporters are absolutely more much engaged on the site, and seem to be naturals at the language of fighting politics in the digital arena,\u201d the official said. \u201cThe content ranges from ironic detachment to cult of personality worship. Biden\u2019s supporters have less to work with. It\u2019s much easier to troll [Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene] than it is to brag about inflation.\u201d There is a great deal of overlap between Trump supporters and adherents of conspiracy theories on TikTok, the official said \u2014\u00a0adding that perhaps surprisingly, they are far more diverse than one might expect, with many Black and Latino creators leading the pro-Trump vanguard on TikTok. \u201cIf you want to know why Biden\u2019s having trouble with his base, just search through Trump\u2019s top supporters on\u00a0TikTok,\u201d the official said. \u201cTrump\u2019s supporters are manifestly more engaged \u2014\u00a0that is something we can measure.\u201d During his administration, Trump amplified concerns about TikTok\u2019s links to China as part of his broader anti-China agenda. Trump put TikTok and its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, at the center of US tensions with China and pushed unsuccessfully to ban the app from the United States\u00a0by executive order. President Joe Biden and a majority of lawmakers have echoed Trump\u2019s concern. Biden signed legislation that would force TikTok to sell to another company or face an outright ban. But Trump now says he opposes a nationwide TikTok ban, adding that such a policy would only alienate young Americans and benefit Meta. Defenders of the app, including TikTok itself, have said that any alleged national security risks linked to the app are purely hypothetical and there has been no publicly presented evidence suggesting the Chinese government has accessed the personal data of TikTok\u2019s US users. On Saturday, Trump\u2019s launch on TikTok \u2014 days after his New York criminal conviction \u2014 seemed to reinforce his transformation. As of Sunday morning, his TikTok account has more than 650,000 followers and his launch video has been viewed more than 6\u00a0million times. The Biden campaign, for its part, also has a presence on TikTok and has continued to post on the platform even as the Biden administration has supported a nationwide TikTok ban. TikTok has\u00a0filed a legal challenge\u00a0to the law Biden signed in April that would ban the app unless it finds a new owner. Oral arguments in the case are scheduled for September.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/politics/donald-trump-joins-tiktok/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The possibility that the disqualification fight could stretch to October, as well as an ongoing question about how the Supreme Court\u2019s upcoming ruling on presidential immunity could impact the prosecution, makes it\u00a0extremely unlikely Trump will go on trial for election subversion in Georgia before Election Day. Attorneys were informed of the tentative date after the case was officially docketed Monday with the appeals court, according to a notice obtained by CNN. Briefs from defense attorneys in the case are due in 20 days. While the court tentatively set an oral argument day, it is not guaranteed. A party to the case has to request an oral argument and the court then decides whether to grant that request. The panel could also decide to forgo oral arguments and rule on the matter based on filed briefs. A panel of three judges \u2013 Todd Markle, Trenton Brown and Benjamin Land \u2013 is set to consider the case.

{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_biden-middle-east-remarks", "text": "President\u00a0Joe\u00a0Biden asserted Friday that Hamas has been degraded to a point where it can no longer carry out the type of attack that launched the current eight-month conflict in Gaza, laying out a three-phase proposal\u00a0Israel has submitted\u00a0to wind down the grinding crisis as he\u00a0declared, \u201cIt\u2019s time\u00a0for this war to end.\u201d It was perhaps the furthest Biden has gone in telling Israel its stated goals for its operation in Gaza\u00a0have\u00a0been met, and that the time has\u00a0arrived to stop the fighting as part of a hostage deal. \u201cAt this point, Hamas no longer is capable of carrying out another October 7, just one of Israel\u2019s main objectives in this war, and quite frankly a righteous one,\u201d Biden said at the White House. He had just laid out a three-phase Israeli proposal that would pair a release of hostages with a \u201cfull and complete ceasefire,\u201d a plan he said presented the best hope to bring peace to Gaza. \u201cThis is truly a decisive moment,\u201d he said. Biden said the Israeli proposal was transmitted this week. The first phase would\u00a0last six weeks and include\u00a0the \u201cwithdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza\u201d and\u00a0\u201crelease of a number of hostages, including women, the elderly, the wounded in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\u201d He said\u00a0Phase 2\u00a0would allow for the \u201cexchange for the release of all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers.\u201d \u201cAnd as long as Hamas lives up to its commitments, the temporary ceasefire would become, in the words of the Israeli proposals, \u2018the cessation of hostilities permanently,\u2019\u201d Biden said. In Phase 3, the president said,\u00a0a \u201cmajor reconstruction plan for Gaza would commence and any final remains of hostages who\u2019ve been killed will be returned to their families.\u201d Less than an hour after Biden detailed the Israeli proposal, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin\u00a0Netanyahu\u00a0insisted the country would not end the war until Hamas is defeated. \u201cThe Israeli government is united in the desire to return our hostages as soon as possible and is working to achieve this goal,\u201d the Prime Minister\u2019s Office said in a statement. \u201cTherefore, the Prime Minister authorized the negotiating team to present an outline for achieving this goal\u00a0while insisting that the war will not end until all of its goals are achieved, including the return of all our hostages and the elimination of Hamas\u2019 military and governmental capabilities.\u201d The Prime Minister\u2019s Office insisted that the \u201cexact outline\u201d of Israel\u2019s proposal allows Israel to \u201cmaintain these\u00a0principles.\u201d Shortly after the statement was released, it was announced that the top four congressional leaders have formally invited Netanyahu to address a joint meeting of Congress, though no date was specified for it to take place. Hamas released a statement later on Friday saying it viewed the proposal positively. \u201cThe Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas views positively what was included in US President Joe Biden\u2019s speech today,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe movement affirms its position of readiness to deal positively and constructively with any proposal based on a permanent ceasefire, complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, reconstruction, the return of the displaced to all their places of residence, and the completion of a serious prisoner exchange deal if the occupation declares its explicit commitment to that.\u201d Former President Barack Obama, in a rare statement about current events, said the ceasefire proposal is \u201cclear, realistic and just.\u201d \u201cA ceasefire alone won\u2019t ease the terrible pain of Israelis whose loved ones were butchered or abducted by Hamas, or the Palestinians whose families have been shattered by the subsequent war,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt won\u2019t resolve the longstanding conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, or answer contentious issues surrounding a two-state solution or continuing settler activity in the West Bank. But what it can do is put a stop to the ongoing bloodshed, help families reunite and allow a surge of humanitarian aid to help desperate, hungry people.\u201d \u2018Nearly identical to Hamas\u2019 own proposals\u2019 Israel\u2019s four-and-a-halfpage proposal was submitted to Hamas on Thursday evening, a US senior administration official said, and matches closely a deal the group itself recently proposed. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly identical to Hamas\u2019 own proposals of only a few weeks ago. So if that\u2019s what Hamas wants, they can take the deal,\u201d the official said. Indirect talks between Israel and\u00a0Hamas on securing the hostages\u2019 release were paused three weeks ago after the sides could not come to an agreement on some of the terms. On Thursday, Hamas said it\u00a0had informed mediators that\u00a0it is\u00a0\u201cprepared to reach a comprehensive agreement\u201d that includes a full\u00a0hostage\u00a0and prisoner exchange deal\u00a0if Israel stops its war in Gaza. A statement from the group said while it\u00a0had shown \u201cflexibility and positivity in dealing with the efforts of the mediators throughout all previous rounds of indirect negotiations.\u201d\u00a0Israel,\u00a0Hamas\u00a0said, had used the months of ongoing talks as a cover to continue its war in Gaza. \u201cHamas\u00a0and the Palestinian factions\u00a0will not\u00a0accept being part of this policy of continuous negotiations in the face of aggression, killing, siege, starvation, and genocide of our people,\u201d\u00a0the\u00a0Hamas\u00a0statement said. Netanyahu has repeatedly insisted that the war must continue until\u00a0Hamas\u00a0is destroyed. In his speech from the White House, Biden acknowledged divisions inside Israel that could prevent a hostage deal from being reached. \u201cI know there are those in Israel who will not agree with this plan and will call for the war to continue indefinitely. Some, some are even in the government coalition,\u201d he said, an unsubtle reference to hardliners in Netanyahu\u2019s government who have resisted efforts to mediate an end to the conflict. \u201cThey made it clear they want to occupy Gaza. They want to keep fighting for years, and the hostages are not a priority to them,\u201d Biden said. Though he did not name anyone in his speech, Biden has previously singled out National Security\u00a0Minister\u00a0Itamar Ben-Gvir as among those in Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition\u00a0who\u00a0are making any progress difficult. Blinken briefs counterparts on proposal US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday briefed his counterparts from Jordan, Turkey and Saudi Arabia about the Israeli proposal. The top US diplomat\u2019s calls, made from his plane as he returned to Washington after a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Prague, are expected to be just the beginning of the diplomatic pressure aimed at getting Hamas to accept the deal. Blinken is expected to have more calls with counterparts on Saturday, a\u00a0senior State Department official said. In his calls Friday, Blinken outlined \u201cthe benefits of the deal\u201d and walked \u201cthe foreign ministers through the deal that was sent to Hamas last night, making sure that they \u2026 understood the benefits to the Palestinian people, the benefits to Israel and the benefits to long-term security plans that we\u2019ve been working on,\u201d the official told reporters traveling with Blinken. Blinken said that the ball is in Hamas\u2019 court to accept the deal without delay, and he specifically emphasized that countries with relations with Hamas \u2013 Turkey \u2013 should urge the group to take the deal. The official stressed that the proposal is \u201cmaterially different\u201d from previous proposals because it would lead to a permanent ceasefire. The official said the Saudi, Turkish and Jordanian foreign ministers had not been briefed on the specific terms of the proposed deal before their calls with Blinken. The official said part of the reason the US made the terms of the deal public was to prevent any inaccurate information from getting leaked, potentially endangering the proposal. \u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0important that the entire world knows the details of this proposal,\u201d the official said. Appeal for Israeli public support In his speech, Biden made a direct appeal to ordinary\u00a0Israelis\u00a0to voice their support for a hostage agreement that would result in a ceasefire. \u201cI need your help. Everyone who wants peace now must raise their voices and let the leaders know they should take this deal. Work to make it real, make it lasting, and forge a better future out of the tragic terror attack and war,\u201d he said. Biden also spoke directly to Americans who have\u00a0criticized\u00a0the violence in Gaza, admitting that too many civilians had been killed and calling the situation \u201cone of the hardest, most complicated problems in the world.\u201d \u201cWe all saw the terrible images from a deadly fire in Rafah earlier this week following an Israeli strike \u2026 targeting Hamas,\u201d Biden said, in his first comments since a strike left dozens of civilians dead. \u201cEven as we worked to surge assistance to Gaza \u2026 the humanitarian crisis still remains.\u201d The president, who returned to the White House from his beach home in Delaware earlier in the morning, had avoided commenting on the situation in Israel for several days. Earlier on Friday, Israel\u00a0said its forces have entered central Rafah, the city in southern Gaza that Biden has warned should not be the target of a major ground offensive. The White House called images from the disaster \u201cheartbreaking\u201d but said the incident had not crossed Biden\u2019s red line for withholding some US weapons shipments to Israel. The president\u00a0told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett\u00a0in an interview this month that he would limit some US arms to Israel if the country\u2019s military \u201cgo into Rafah.\u201d But he has remained vague about how he will quantify such a decision, leading to frustrations and a degree of\u00a0confusion over his stance. Many Democrats, along with foreign leaders who the US counts as allies, say Israel\u2019s actions clearly cross a red line \u2013 if not Biden\u2019s, then their own and those of international law. White House officials have sought this week to explain Biden\u2019s stance, suggesting his barometer for changing policy would be a \u201cmajor ground invasion\u201d of the city. This story has been updated with additional details. CNN\u2019s Jeremy Diamond, Hamdi Alkhshali, Kareem Khadder, Annie Grayer, AnneClaire Stapleton and Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/politics/biden-middle-east-remarks/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_felon-trump-rights-what-matters", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s conviction by a New York jury on 34 felony counts is historic and unprecedented. No former president or major party presidential candidate has also been a felon. When CNN asked readers for their questions, a flood came in. Some of the more interesting and most-asked questions are below. And if there\u2019s something we didn\u2019t get to, ask us here. It varies by state. In New York, where Trump was convicted, there are \u201ccollateral consequences\u201d of being convicted of a felony. Importantly, felons in New York cannot hold many public offices, including elected positions. But Trump is no longer a New York resident. In Florida, felons lose civil rights, including the ability to hold public office and serve on a jury. While he can\u2019t hold office in Florida or New York, there\u2019s nothing in the Constitution to bar him from running for president. In New York, a felon can apply for a Certificate of Good Conduct to restore all rights after a certain period of time. The charges against Trump are Class E felonies, for which the period is three years. Florida requires felons to apply for clemency through a special board, but in the case of out-of-state convictions like Trump\u2019s, it defers to the state where the person was convicted. Not in this case. Presidents have the power to issue pardons for federal offenses. Trump has been convicted of a felony in New York state court. That would require the pardon of New York\u2019s governor, Democrat Kathy Hochul, who has praised his conviction. Most likely. Trump is a Florida resident, and Florida defers to New York law on the question of felons voting. New York allows felons to vote as long as they are not incarcerated. His sentencing is set for July 11, four days before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. Judge Juan Merchan could technically impose prison time \u2013 felony falsifying business records can be punished with up to four years in prison. But Trump has been convicted of Class E felonies, the lowest level in New York law. He is also a first-time offender. That said, Merchan could take into account that Trump has repeatedly violated a gag order. Here\u2019s what Secret Service chief of communications Anthony Guglielmi told CNN after the jury reached the guilty verdict: \u201cToday\u2019s outcome has no bearing on the\u00a0manner in which\u00a0the United States Secret Service carries out its protective mission. Our security measures will proceed unchanged.\u201d No one knows exactly. Time in prison still seems relatively unlikely for this offense. One can imagine the US Supreme Court getting involved or the sentence being delayed until after his term, or even a pardon by the New York governor in the interest of the country. But these are all just possibilities. Yes. A survey of past cases by the legal website Just Security  found numerous examples of prison time being imposed for this offense. These types of convictions do not usually lead to jail time. Trump\u2019s conviction does not automatically prevent him from holding a US passport. But it could make it difficult to travel to some countries. Thirty-eight countries don\u2019t allow felons to enter their borders, according to World Population Review, which says that some of those countries deny entry to felons \u201cup front\u201d while others do so only after such a conviction is \u201cdiscovered.\u201d That list includes Canada and Mexico, as well as Australia, China and South Africa. Federal law bars individuals convicted of a felony from possessing a firearm, and most states have analogous prohibitions. A case challenging the federal prohibition has been appealed to the US Supreme Court, but the justices have not yet said whether they will hear the challenge. In New York, convicted felons cannot obtain a permit to possess a firearm. It\u2019s possible for Trump to later petition a state judge to have his firearm possession rights restored. In Florida, where Trump is a resident, the Sunshine State has a similar felon disarmament law on the books. That law bars people convicted of a felony in Florida courts from possessing a firearm and also extends that prohibition to individuals found guilty of a felony in another state. But under Florida law, the state\u2019s Clemency Board \u201cwill not consider requests for firearm authority from individuals convicted in federal or out-of-state courts,\u201d according to the state. Technically. But not likely. The Supreme Court ruled this year that Congress could keep Trump off ballots if it passed a special measure determining he took part in an insurrection. That\u2019s not at issue in this New York case, and it\u2019s not going to happen when Republicans control the House as they currently do. The Constitution also allows for people who are impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate to be barred from federal office. Trump was impeached twice as president but acquitted twice in the Senate. Yes. Appeals and the sentencing process are ongoing, so the gag order remains in effect. That means every time Trump criticizes a key witness like Michael Cohen, he dances up to the line of violating the gag order, which could lead to penalties like fines or even jail time. The trial has been delayed by allegations of impropriety against Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis for her relationship with a former prosecutor on the case. As a result, a trial date has not been set. Trump\u2019s two federal trials are also on ice. The judge in Florida overseeing the case in which federal prosecutors allege he mishandled classified documents and tried to hide them from the National Archives has proceeded very slowly and has allowed procedural questions to pile up. The trial is currently postponed indefinitely. In the federal election subversion case in Washington, DC, the Supreme Court has yet to weigh in on whether Trump should enjoy immunity from prosecution as a former president. The hush money payoff took place just before the 2016 election. The fact of the payments was discovered in 2018. Federal prosecutors ultimately decided not to pursue charges against Trump related to the payments and so did a previous Manhattan DA, Cy Vance Jr. It was seen as a gamble when current Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg ultimately announced charges in April 2023. It would be difficult for anyone with a felony conviction to get security clearance. But presidents do not need to obtain security clearance. The voters have essentially given them access to all the country\u2019s secrets. Falsifying business records is a misdemeanor in New York unless the crime is committed with intent to commit another crime. In this case, the other crimes were federal campaign violations.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/politics/felon-trump-rights-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}

But don\u2019t expect committed Donald Trump voters to suddenly waver because their candidate is now a convicted felon. \u201cJust an abuse of the justice system,\u201d Billy Pierce, a semi-retired consultant and Trump backer in\u00a0Hartsville, South Carolina, said shortly after the former president was found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records in his Manhattan hush money trial. \u201cBiden and Democrats can\u2019t win the 2024 election in the polls, so they use prosecution of Trump to try to keep him out of office. This verdict will not hold up through appeals,\u201d he added, repeating Trump\u2019s false claims about President Joe Biden being behind the New York prosecution. Andrew Konchek, a commercial fisherman and Trump\u00a0supporter\u00a0in New Hampshire, responded to the verdict with sarcastic references to former President Bill Clinton\u2019s personal\u00a0scandals. \u201cThere\u2019s no direct evidence and from who, Cohen?\u00a0Who\u2019s a habitual liar and has been disbarred? I smell some bullshit,\u201d he added referring to the prosecution\u2019s star witness, former Trump fixer Michael Cohen. Another Trump backer in New Hampshire, Debbie Katsanos, texted during the jury deliberations. \u201cI see no crime,\u201d she said. \u201cCertainly at a felony level. I am sorry to say I can\u2019t trust the justice system when it\u2019s being used in a political way. \u00a0\u2026 Yes, no one is above the law, when a law is broken they should be held accountable. I\u2019m just not seeing it in this case.\u201d Iowa Trump supporter Chris Mudd, who owns a solar energy business, said his backing of the former president is solid. \u201cI do think the verdict is bad for America,\u201d Mudd said in a text. \u201cCan\u2019t believe this is happening in this country.\u201d Betsy Sarcone was a Nikki Haley voter in the Iowa caucuses and late last year said she would vote Biden if it ended up a Biden-Trump rematch. But she has shifted dramatically since the caucuses. \u201cI\u2019ve been following this sideshow semi closely,\u201d she said after the jury verdict that gave Trump a place in history as the first former president or presumptive party nominee convicted of a felony. \u201cThis does not impact my plans to vote Republican. I don\u2019t even like Donald Trump and this was a witch hunt, made up crimes on the part of the judge and DA. It will never stand on appeal. \u2026 I actually don\u2019t think it will hurt him. People are so sick of the sideshows to distract/avoid/gaslight people away from the real problems in this country.\u00a0To be clear, I\u2019m still not a Trump fan, but it\u2019s pretty clear these cases are being motivated politically.\u201d Pierce, Konchek, Sarcone and Katsanos are all\u00a0participating in a CNN project to follow the 2024 election through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds or are part of key voting blocs.\u00a0We will check back as news of the historic 34 count conviction sinks in, and as the former president prepares to be sentenced in July \u2013\u00a0days before he is to be officially nominated for president at the Republican National Convention. But our conversations before and during the trial were eye opening: the overwhelming majority of the Trump supporters in our voter groups viewed the cases against the former president \u2014 especially the Manhattan one \u2014 as politically motivated. (The former president pleaded not guilty in this and three other looming criminal cases.) Even many Republicans who are not Trump fans share the view\u00a0that he\u00a0is being unfairly targeted.\u00a0Biden supporters, on the other hand, saw the verdicts as Trump finally being held accountable for what they see as a lifetime of cheating and lying. Matt Vrahiotes, a Christian conservative who runs a fruit winery in\u00a0Hall\u00a0County, Georgia, was troubled by the charges in the Manhattan case: falsifying business records to hide hush money payments to an adult film star, allegedly to help the 2016 Trump campaign. \u201cI mean it sounds crazy, its sounds like an irresponsible person, an irresponsible thing to do,\u201d Vrahiotes said in April. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of things going on with both candidates, and a lot of things that are morally in question for both of them, so,\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0really hard for me to say, oh don\u2019t like one candidate because of what\u2019s going on, versus promoting another. You know, you got to let the trial go through, you\u2019ve got to let the judge decide what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong, and\u00a0I\u2019ll\u00a0go from there.\u201d Jan Gardner, a Trump backer who lives in Dunwoody, an Atlanta suburb, said before the verdict that he has lost faith in the justice system. \u201cDo we feel that some of the things that go on, that there\u2019s a double standard?\u201d Gardner asked, mentioning Hillary Clinton, who, in his view, was treated differently than Trump. \u201d I have questions about the \u2026 how much in honesty and how much power can buy you things.\u201d Republican and likely Trump voter Devin McIver\u00a0said he did not closely follow the trial but would not be putting \u201ctime or energy\u201d into thinking about Trump being found guilty, writing in a text that he believes he was \u201cbetter off when Trump was president.\u201d Uneasy about Trump, but not sold on the Manhattan case We hear the unfairness argument a lot in our travels, even from Republicans who are Trump critics. Linda Rooney is a Haley supporter from Media, Pennsylvania, wrestling with whether to cast a reluctant Trump vote or write in the former South Carolina governor or someone else. Rooney has \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about Trump being convicted, telling us she didn\u2019t think the case had \u201cmerit\u201d but saying she\u2019d \u201clove to see him behind bars but for one of the many other things he\u2019s done. Like the White House records case or January 6.\u201d She said she hoped that with\u00a0the conviction, Trump would\u00a0\u201cbow out of the race on his own now and let someone more suitable run \u2014 like Nikki Haley.\u201d But she acquiesced, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s in Donald Trump to bow out.\u201d Similarly, fellow Pennsylvania voter Irma Fralic, who voted for Haley in the primary, sees politics behind the Manhattan case. \u201cThe current trial in New York, it\u2019s totally political,\u201d Fralic told us last week at her Montgomery County home. \u201cI looked briefly at some of those things, and it just doesn\u2019t hold water.\u201d Former Trump voter Joan London had a mixed take on the convictions. She was a Republican for more than 40 years, switching her registration to independent after casting a vote for Haley in the April Pennsylvania primary. She left the GOP because of Trump. London, an attorney, said she expected a \u201cmore mixed verdict\u201d because \u201cPresident Trump didn\u2019t sign all of the checks that were at issue, and Michael Cohen\u2019s past history of lying and stealing.\u201d Still, London said, \u201cThis verdict has no impact on my voting plans.\u00a0Still no plans to vote for either Trump or Biden.\u201d Celebration and some caution among Biden voters Darrell Ann Murphy offered a reaction typical of the Biden supporters in our voter groups. \u201cWow! A great day,\u201d said Murphy, who lives in Northampton County, Pennsylvania. \u201cFinally he\u2019s found guilty!! Friends texting me like crazy all happy. Lots of Biden voters I talk to.\u201d Pat Levin, another Biden voter in Northampton County, said of the verdict: \u201cIt supports and reinforces I believe in the rule of Law.\u00a0It supports my attitude towards the limits of executive power.\u00a0It reinforces my belief in the tenets of democracy. They have a strong judicial system.\u00a0I am enormously grateful to this jury and its seriousness of purpose.\u201d David Moore is a registered Republican in Nogales, Arizona, but plans to vote for Biden because he cannot support Trump. He responded to the verdict with a question: \u201cCan he still run if he\u2019s in appeals?\u201d Yes, the conviction does not preclude Trump from running. \u201cI\u2019m not counting chickens,\u201d Moore said. \u201cA lot of folks around me seem very happy about it. I\u2019m curious to see how this all goes.\u201d Recent University of Michigan graduate Jade Gray was a co-president of the College Democrats on campus. \u201cFrom the minute he was elected it was historical for all of the wrong reasons,\u201d she said of\u00a0Trump. \u201cBeing the first president who is a convicted solidifies that legacy.\u00a0This is what accountability looks like. I know it\u2019s said a lot, but no one is above the law and Trump has repeatedly shown himself to be a crooked, untrustworthy person.\u201d Nanette Mees, a Republican but Trump critic who lives in suburban Loudon County, Virginia, offered this: \u201cPersonally I am thrilled he was found guilty and pray that there are no big riots because of his followers.\u201d And Joanna Brooks, a Black voter who runs a yoga studio in suburban Milwaukee, described herself as \u201cshocked but happy. \u2026 It\u2019s bizarre to me that this wouldn\u2019t necessarily impact his run for presidency. He will appeal and play victim and his supporters will probably love him all the more.\u201d Deep divide among voters The sharp divide was again evident as more reactions from voters flowed in Friday morning. Trump supporter Rachel Kulak, a Christian conservative who lives in the Richmond, Virginia, suburbs called the verdict \u201cderanged\u201d and part of a justice system she views as warped by Democrats. \u201cBiden\u00a0cannot win in \u201824 so we have weaponization, lawfare against Trump,\u201d Kulak said, comparing the case to political prosecutions in Russia and Venezuela. \u201cTo not be able to trust the legal system according to our own laws, to know that it is not blind but being used to further the agenda of ruining our country, we are in a dangerous place. I do not recognize America for America anymore.\u201d Attorney Priscilla Forsyth of Sioux City, Iowa, was a Haley supporter in the Iowa caucuses but said Trump has her \u201ccomplete support\u201d now. \u201cI am very sad about what this has done to our criminal justice system and very angry that the system I have given 38 years of my life to was perverted into an attempt to destroy a political opponent,\u201d Forsyth said. \u201cI feel it was a travesty of justice and it makes me sick to my stomach.\u201d \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republicans and Democrats, however, voiced gratitude at the convictions. Angela Lang, a community organizer in Milwaukee, said the convictions might help her canvassers when they encounter voters who are considering voting for Trump. \u201cThese are more facts to talk about when we talk to voters,\u201d Lang said. \u201cOne of our\u00a0ambassadors mentioned that we have to make sure people know about this and what this actually means. It\u2019s not just \u2018he slept with a porn star,\u2019 it\u2019s deeper and how it tried to impact the 2016 election.\u201d Zoila Sanchez, a Las Vegas real estate agent who describes herself as a Reagan Republican, said she followed the trial closely. \u201cAlthough I believed he was guilty, I thought he might be acquitted due to his remarkable luck,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cI am\u00a0pleased\u00a0that our legal system has once again prevailed.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reaction.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/politics/voters-trump-conviction-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_01_politics_mexico-woman-president-what-matters", "text": "While American voters are looking at the same old options in their coming election, Mexican voters will choose between two women as the major-party candidates in their presidential election this weekend. Women in Mexico did not enjoy universal suffrage until 1953, a full 33 years after women gained the right in the US, but the country is almost sure to have its first female leader before the US does. CNN\u2019s Tara John points out in an analysis for CNN International that Mexico\u2019s likely election of a woman as president is \u201ca remarkable achievement in a country known for its patriarchal culture and high rates of gender-based violence, where\u00a0around 10 women\u00a0are murdered every day.\u201d But the breaking of Mexico\u2019s glass ceiling will also be overshadowed by the multifaceted problems of gang violence, targeted politicians and rampant crime. Read more. The influence of women in Mexican politics is evident in other branches of government. Mexico\u2019s Supreme Court elected its first female chief justice in January 2023. Her court also decriminalized abortion in Mexico, an inverse of the US, where five conservatives on the US Supreme Court (four men and one woman) overruled the court\u2019s liberals (two women and one man at that time) to take nationwide abortion rights away from American women in June 2022. Some of the reasons for Mexico\u2019s move toward political gender parity are structural. Mexican law requires political parties there to put equal numbers of women and men up for election. That\u2019s not going to happen in the US. There are also one-term limits on presidents, forcing more turnover. The current front-runner in Mexico\u2019s presidential election, Claudia Sheinbaum, is on the ballot because her party\u2019s popular president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, must step aside. The Supreme Court has a woman as chief justice in part because justices in Mexico serve 15-year terms. I talked to Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, about obstacles American women face in politics. She noted that the progress American women had been making for decades at the state level, beginning in the 1970s, had stalled until after the election of Donald Trump in 2016, when a new generation of American women got active. Since the 2018 midterms\ufeff, though, progress has slowed. Now, according to CAWP\u2019s tally for 2024: Those figures continue to slowly grow, but they are nowhere near gender parity. By comparison, half of the legislators in Mexico\u2019s lower house of Congress are women, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union. In countries with quota systems, the move toward parity has been much quicker, but Walsh said we shouldn\u2019t expect such a system in the US. \u201cThe concept of quotas, as you well know, is sort of antithetical to the American image of pulling themselves up by their bootstraps, the best candidates will rise to the top,\u201d Walsh said. When I asked what obstacles women face in US politics, she rattled off a list. Republicans elect fewer women First, Walsh said, there is an obvious partisan element. More elected women are Democrats, which might seem obvious. But the imbalance is amplified at the state level and in legislatures, where most elected representatives serve. Just picking one state, Georgia, she pointed out that 59% of Democratic legislators are women compared with 16% of Republican legislators. In Florida, two-thirds of Democratic legislators are women compared with less than a third of Republicans. See data for all the states here. Walsh argued that both parties must do a better job of recruiting and supporting women who run for office, and she said it\u2019s important to make sure women are running in seats where they can win, as opposed to seats where they have no chance. Part of the reason for the imbalance is due to policy, but it\u2019s also a matter of priorities in how Republicans recruit candidates, Walsh argued. \u201cThe philosophy of the party generally is the best candidate will rise to the top, and whether it\u2019s a man or a woman or a person of color or a White person, it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she said. Campaign finance is a problem for female candidates The way campaigns are funded is an obstacle, according to Walsh, because women are less likely to be able to fund their own campaigns. \u201cWe know that parties love self-funders, because a self-funding candidate is less of a strain on the party itself in terms of providing support,\u201d she said. She argued that women also tend to raise money in smaller amounts, less than $200, which makes the process of fundraising much more arduous. Politics feels more dangerous \u201cPolitics has gotten particularly ugly, fraught and dangerous,\u201d Walsh said, pointing to the 2020 kidnapping plot against Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Walsh argued that online threats seem to disproportionately affect female officeholders and candidates. That perception could have a chilling effect on women seeking office. Walsh does think the US will ultimately elect a woman as president. \u201cIt\u2019s a frustrating process to see how slow it can be,\u201d she said. Hillary Clinton was the first woman to be a major-party presidential nominee in 2016, and Kamala Harris became the first woman to be elected to nationwide office when she shared the Democratic presidential ticket with Joe Biden in 2020. Notably, Democrats selected Biden from a field that included six women, including Harris, that cycle. Trump could also choose a woman as his running mate for this November\u2019s election. But it seems unlikely that he will pick the only Republican woman to ever win a presidential primary, Nikki Haley, who won contests in Vermont and the District of Columbia this year. When I noted Haley\u2019s success to Walsh as a sign of progress, she countered: \u201cShe\u2019s not the nominee.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/politics/mexico-woman-president-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_06_03_politics_republicans-justice-system-what-matters", "text": "Last week, President Joe Biden was defending the justice system as a \u201ccornerstone\u201d of society. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous, it\u2019s irresponsible for anyone to say this was rigged just because they don\u2019t like the verdict,\u201d Biden said at the White House after Republicans tried to undercut the process that led to former President Donald Trump\u2019s conviction in New York on state charges. This week, the president will have to remember those words while his son Hunter faces federal gun charges at a trial in Delaware, the first of two separate cases this year that could lead to jail time. The Biden family must be frustrated that a plea deal fell apart last year when it was rejected by the Trump-appointed judge in the case, Maryellen Noreika. Plus, these particular gun charges are rarely prosecuted on their own, perhaps evidence of the enhanced scrutiny placed on a president\u2019s son. Very different trials Hunter Biden\u2019s gun trial is very different than Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial, even if they both come in an election year, feature the public airing of painful, personal details and essentially boil down to allegations of lying on paperwork. Trump had to endure the detailed, public testimony of Stormy Daniels, the adult-film actress who alleged an affair with Trump nearly 20 years ago. Hunter Biden will have to endure a public recounting of his affair with his brother Beau\u2019s widow, their tortured text messages and his drug addiction. But Trump\u2019s legal problems all revolve around his own campaigns and actions during and after his presidency. Trump was found guilty of falsifying business records to hide hush money payments meant to cover up the alleged affair from voters in 2016. He also faces federal charges of mishandling classified information in Florida and trying to overturn the 2020 election in Washington, DC, as well as Georgia. Hunter Biden faces trial in Delaware starting this week for lying on a firearm background check application. He checked the box that said \u201cno\u201d he was not abusing or addicted to drugs. He also faces trial in California later this year for tax evasion. David Weiss, the Trump-appointed special counsel prosecuting the case, has never made allegations to tie Hunter Biden\u2019s tax problems to his father, although Republicans on Capitol Hill have tried, unsuccessfully, to connect the dots. I\u2019ve written before about how the Department of Justice ends up prosecuting similar numbers of Democratic and Republican lawmakers. In New York this week, for instance, the bribery trial of New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez \u2013 his second distinct corruption trial in recent years \u2013 is underway. Trump may ultimately avoid federal prosecution. There is a very real possibility that Trump, while found guilty in a New York courtroom, will face neither set of the federal charges brought against him by special counsel Jack Smith before Election Day in November. The US Supreme Court has yet to weigh in on Trump\u2019s claim of absolute immunity, and the judge in his classified documents case has delayed proceedings indefinitely. The Georgia case is also delayed, and an appeals court may not consider whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis can stay on the case until October. A chorus of bias allegations But while Joe Biden\u2019s son and the senior senator from New Jersey are both in major legal peril, it is quickly becoming an article of faith among Republicans that they are a targeted species by the justice system. \u201cWhat people are seeing now is that they can\u2019t trust our judicial system,\u201d Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump told CNN\u2019s Kasie Hunt on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d The justice system \u201chunts Republicans while\u00a0protecting Democrats,\u201d said Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, reacting to the Trump guilty verdict. In a fundraising pitch on X, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida encouraged supporters angry about the \u201ctravesty\u201d to \u201cget even.\u201d Appearing on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas took the conspiracy theorizing much further, arguing that the Department of Justice is only prosecuting Menendez and, separately, Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas (who is also charged with bribery) because they have been critical of Biden on foreign relations and immigration policy \u2013 an allegation for which there is no evidence. Cotton predicted Biden would ultimately pardon his son. The White House has said there will be no pardon for Hunter Biden. Even Republicans who opposed Trump during the 2024 primary season are critical of Trump\u2019s New York conviction. New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu complained that Trump will face sentencing days before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. \u201cThat is a terrible idea,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to do nothing but rile everybody up. It\u2019s going to look even more political than it is now, and just cast a shadow of a doubt on this entire case.\u201d \u2018I may feel differently about it\u2019 The irony here is that Trump in 2020 actually did pressure the Department of Justice to investigate Hunter Biden. He also pushed Ukraine\u2019s government to open an investigation, hoping to tie Hunter Biden\u2019s work for a Ukrainian natural gas company to his father. In 2016, Trump\u2019s supporters would launch into \u201clock her up\u201d chants targeting Hillary Clinton \u2013 behavior Trump encouraged at the time even though the FBI, in the form of then-director James Comey, announced before the election that there was not a strong enough case to prosecute Clinton over her private email server. Trump said on Fox News over the weekend that if elected again, he might feel differently about pushing for charges against Clinton. \u201cThey all said \u2018lock her up.\u2019 But I felt \u2013 and I could have done it \u2013 but I thought it would have been a terrible thing. And then this happened to me. So I may feel differently about it,\u201d Trump said. Democrats promise to let the process play out against Hunter Biden Don\u2019t expect Democrats to show the same level of support for Hunter Biden that Republicans have shown for Trump. Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, promised Democrats would respect the process as it plays out against the president\u2019s son. \u201cDemocrats are not out there saying that Hunter Biden\u2019s trial is a farce, it\u2019s a fraud, it\u2019s rigged.

That\u2019s very upsetting to hear that.\u201d Last week, Hogan had urged Americans to \u201crespect the verdict and the legal process\u201d before a Manhattan jury\u00a0found Donald Trump guilty\u00a0of all 34 charges\u00a0of falsifying business records. The unprecedented and historic verdict makes\u00a0Trump the first former president in American history to be convicted of a felony. \u201cAt this dangerously divided moment in our history, all leaders\u2014regardless of party\u2014must not pour fuel on the fire with more toxic partisanship. We must reaffirm what has made this nation great: the rule of law,\u201d Hogan had said. Asked Sunday  whether the RNC would withhold money from Hogan\u2019s campaign,\u00a0Lara Trump\u00a0declined to answer directly but again called Hogan\u2019s statement \u201cridiculous.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll get back to you on all the specifics monetarily. But what I can tell you is that, as the Republican Party co-chair, I think he should never have said something like that,\u201d\u00a0she\u00a0said. Hogan winning the Senate seat in Maryland would be a pickup for Republicans in a Democratic state. He was first elected governor in 2014,\u00a0comfortably won reelection\u00a0in 2018 and left office in January 2023 with high approval ratings. In recent decades, Maryland has been dominated by the Democratic Party at the state and federal levels. George H.W. Bush was the last Republican presidential nominee to win the Old Line State, in 1988. Lara Trump added Sunday that \u201cthe American people have really spoken up\u201d after the hush money conviction. \u201cThe American people came out and in 48 hours after Donald\u00a0Trump\u2019s verdict was read, our campaign and the RNC raised $70 million in digital fundraising,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that that was a very quick, very rapid and very strong response from the American people. It has gone way too far,\u201d Lara Trump added. \u201cThe American people are upset and they spoke out about it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/politics/lara-trump-larry-hogan-donald-trump-hush-money-verdict/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "politics"}}
