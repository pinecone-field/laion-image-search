{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_turnout-2024-election-analysis", "text": "For decades, Democrats have built their electoral strategies on a common assumption: the higher the turnout, the better their chances of winning. But that familiar equation may no longer apply for President Joe Biden in 2024. A wide array of polls this year shows Biden running best among Americans with the most consistent history of voting, while former President Donald Trump often displays the most strength among people who have been the least likely to vote. These new patterns are creating challenges for each party. Trump\u2019s potential appeal to more irregular voters, particularly younger Black and Latino men, is compelling Democrats to rethink longstanding strategies that focused on mobilizing as many younger and non-White voters as possible without worrying about their partisan allegiance. For Republicans, the challenge will be to build an organization capable of connecting with irregular voters they have not traditionally focused on reaching, particularly in minority communities. \u201cWhat all this means is this election has volatility,\u201d says Daniel Hopkins, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist who has studied the widening partisan divergence between voters with and without a consistent history of turning out. \u201cWe used to expect that the marginal non-voter, the next voter who turned out if an election was very engaging, didn\u2019t look different from people who did vote. In this case, the crowd that hasn\u2019t gotten engaged looks very, very different.\u201d Merged results from the three most recent national NBC polls, conducted by a bipartisan team of prominent Democratic and Republican pollsters, for instance, found that Biden leads Trump by 4 percentage points among people who voted in both 2020 and 2022. But among those who voted in 2020 but not 2022, Trump led Biden by 12 percentage points. Trump\u2019s lead swelled to 20 percentage points among those who did not vote in either 2020 or 2022. Fully 65% of those who did not vote in either of the past two elections said they disapproved of Biden\u2019s performance in office. Combined results from recent national New York Times/Siena College polls likewise have found Biden narrowly leading among potential 2024 voters who turned out in 2020 while trailing Trump by double digits among those who did not vote in their previous contest. Hopkins has conducted perhaps the most ambitious attempt to quantify the divergence between Americans with and without a history of voting. Earlier this year, he and a colleague worked with NORC at the University of Chicago to survey over 2,400 adults about their preferences in the 2024 race. The poll only surveyed people who were old enough to vote in each of the past three elections \u2014 the midterms of 2018 and 2022 and the 2020 presidential race. The results were striking. Among adults who had voted in each of the past three federal elections, Biden led Trump by 11 points, and Biden eked out a narrow advantage among voters who participated in two of the past three races. But, the poll found, Trump led Biden by 12 percentage points among those who voted in just one of the past three elections and by a crushing margin of 18 percentage points among those who came out for none of them. As important, the pattern held across racial lines. In the poll, Trump ran even with Biden among Latinos who voted in two, one or none of the past three elections, while Biden held a nearly 20-point advantage among those who voted in all three. With Black voters, Biden\u2019s lead was just 10 points among those who did not show up for any of the past three elections, but over 80 points among those who participated in all three. Using data from Catalist, a leading Democratic voter targeting firm, Michael Podhorzer, the former political director of the AFL-CIO, reached similar conclusions. He found that in 2020 Biden\u2019s margins over Trump were higher among people who voted in the three previous elections of 2018, 2016 and 2014 than those who voted in some or none of them \u2014 and that the relationship held across racial lines. Hopkins said the gap between habitual and irregular voters in his latest survey was far greater than the difference he found when he conducted a similar poll early in the 2016 race between Trump and Hillary Clinton. Key to this widening chasm, he believes, may be another dynamic: Adults who are less likely to vote are also less likely to follow political news. \u201cFor more infrequent voters, these are often people who pay less attention to politics and whose political barometer is more the question of how is my family doing economically, how does the country seem to be doing,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cFor those voters, Donald Trump\u2026is not especially unusual.\u201d By contrast, Hopkins said, a \u201csizable sliver\u201d of habitual voters \u201chave a sense that Trump may be qualitatively different than other political candidates with respect to norm violations and January 6.\u201d\u00a0For less frequent voters, he added, the equation may be as simple as \u201cthey don\u2019t love what they see with Joe Biden, and if Donald Trump is the person running against Joe Biden, they want change.\u201d The NBC polling results buttress that conclusion: It found that among the roughly one-sixth of voters who say they do not follow political news, Trump led Biden by fully 2-to-1. Several analysts caution that while this divergence between high- and low-frequency voters is appearing consistently in polls now, it\u2019s too early to say for certain whether it will persist through Election Day. \u201cIt\u2019s May,\u201d said Republican pollster Bill McInturff, whose firm conducts the NBC poll with a Democratic partner. \u201cThis data matters when people start having to vote.\u201d Democratic strategist Tom Bonier pointed out that public opinion surveys often have enough trouble measuring attitudes among young people and minorities, let alone accurately capturing those who are most disengaged from the political system. Melissa Morales \u2014 founder and president of Somos Votantes and Somos PAC, groups that mobilize Latino voters \u2014 said that in their outreach campaigns this year, they are not seeing the tilt toward Trump among low-frequency voters evident in these multiple polls. In their work during 2022, she said,\u00a0\u201cWe were hearing it in the field, with low propensity Latino voters, they were open to Trump, especially [over] the economy.\u201d But, she added, \u201cWe are not hearing that in the field right now\u201d and instead \u201cwhat we are hearing is deep concern about the cost of living, rising costs, and a strong desire to know what the path forward is.\u201d Even with all these cautions, there are strong reasons to believe that Trump may benefit more from a very large overall turnout this year than Biden would. That conclusion is consistent with the other unusual demographic patterns evident in the 2024 election. So far, in almost all polls, Biden is holding a higher share of his 2020 vote among White than non-White voters; he\u2019s also maintaining more of his 2020 level of support with seniors than with young people. Among Whites, Biden, as in 2020, is running much better with those who hold at least a four-year college degree than those who don\u2019t. Biden\u2019s relative strength among seniors and college-educated White voters means that he\u2019s drawing from two of the most reliable voting blocs in the electorate. In 2020, about 75% of people older than 65 voted, compared to just 54% of young people aged 18-29, according to calculations from Census data by William Frey, a demographer at Brookings Metro. (Even that was a big increase in turnout among young people from the 2012 and 2016 elections.) Far more White voters with degrees turned out than those without them as well. Turnout was especially modest among the Black and Latino voters who have shown the most receptivity to Trump \u2014 men without a college degree. Only slightly less than half of them voted in 2020, Frey found. Most experts who study turnout consider it unlikely that as many people will vote this year as in 2020, largely because so many voters hold negative views about both Biden and Trump. After a record 160 million people voted in 2020, Bonier said his preliminary calculation is that turnout in 2024 is more likely to reach between 145-150 million with the possibility that as few as 140 million people will vote. Jeremy Smith, CEO of Civitech, a Democratic voter data and targeting firm, said that the number of people registered to even potentially vote is way down from the total at this point in the 2020 cycle. \u201cGenerally, if you said there are two possible electorates \u2014 one is 140 million people voting and one is 160 million people \u2014 the high likelihood is that the 140 would be better for Biden,\u201d said Bonier, a senior adviser and former CEO of TargetSmart, a leading Democratic targeting firm. If turnout shrinks from 2020, the key question for the two sides will be which voters fall away \u2014 and how many new voters enter the electorate to replace them. Generally, Democrats believe that in the Trump era the party benefits when the most habitual voters comprise a larger share of the electorate. Many Democrats believe that a key reason the party exceeded expectations in the 2022 midterm is that the electorate tilted more than anticipated toward these regular voters. The Democratic polling firm Equis Research, which focuses on Latino voters, for instance, found in its post-election analysis that Democrats performed slightly better than expected with that group largely because irregular Latino voters, who were more receptive to Trump, failed to come out. Michael Madrid, a long-time GOP strategist who has become a fierce Trump critic, said that the disappointing 2022 results for Republicans showed the risk for the party in the turnout patterns that the former president has triggered. Republicans under Trump, Madrid argued, are gaining support among non-White men, particularly Latinos, while shedding support among college-educated White voters, especially women. The danger for the GOP, Madrid said, is that the latter group turns out at a far higher rate than the former (as Frey\u2019s data shows). Given that disparity, Madrid argued, Trump \u201cneeds a high turnout\u201d that pulls in less reliable minority voters, especially Latino men. Trump\u2019s conundrum, Madrid said, is that the belligerent rule-breaking persona that attracts those younger non-White men alienates more of the well-educated White women already trending away from him. \u201cHe is talking to a single young male between video games: He\u2019s got them, they love him,\u201d Madrid said. \u201cBut there are suburban women that you lose by that, who hate that. That\u2019s his dilemma. He gets the turnout, but he also gets the turnoff.\u201d The best-case scenario for Trump is that an unusually large number of these irregularly voting working-class minorities come out to vote for him. Given his success in the past two elections at turning out irregularly voting working-class Whites, no one discounts his chances of turning out irregularly voting working-class non-Whites this time. But it\u2019s hardly guaranteed: Though these voters tend to be strongly discontented with the economy, Democrats believe they can loosen Trump\u2019s hold on them by highlighting his views on other issues, such as his pledges to implement a mass deportation effort against undocumented migrants, or to pardon White supremacists convicted in the January 6, 2021, insurrection. And as Podhorzer argued, unhappiness with the economy historically has not proven to be a powerful force in motivating irregular voters to show up. But Republicans point out that even if Trump doesn\u2019t win as many of these irregularly voting non-White men as polls show today, he will still benefit if they drift toward third-party candidates or simply choose not to vote. Looking at the Black community, \u201ceven if you don\u2019t buy the potential for Trump to flip lots of votes there, it seems there\u2019s considerable risk of a turnout drop-off that will hit Biden\u2019s raw margins out of big cities in the battlegrounds that Democrats usually depend on,\u201d said GOP pollster Patrick Ruffini. For that reason, many voter mobilization experts say Democrats can\u2019t give up on infrequent voters showing receptivity to Trump. Podhorzer pointed out that Democrats can still benefit from high turnout if the campaign\u2019s final weeks focus on the aspects of Trump\u2019s agenda that most alienate the irregular voters who surged to the polls against him in 2020. Morales said the number of low-frequency Latino voters that Somos PAC turned out in Nevada in 2022 exceeded Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto\u2019s margin of victory there, and the group remains committed to reaching those same voters for Biden. \u201cNot only can we get them out to vote, but when we have a conversation about the contrast and what their votes mean on the issues, we can win those voters over,\u201d Morales said. All of these dynamics may prove most volatile with younger voters. Through the 21st century, as first Millennials and now Generation Z have entered the electorate in large numbers, Democrats have unwaveringly operated on the belief that turning out as many young voters as possible would benefit the party. But that\u2019s a much more uncertain proposition in 2024, as demonstrated by the latest youth poll from the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics, probably the most in-depth look at attitudes among young people. In the IOP poll this spring, Biden led Trump by nearly 20 points among young adults (aged 18-29) who said they definitely plan to vote in November; that lead was comparable to Biden\u2019s advantage among all young adults in 2020. But Trump\u2019s position steadily improved as the likelihood of voting diminished, with the former president leading Biden by 2-to-1 among those who said they probably would not vote. Those who indicated they were less likely to vote tended to be young people without a college degree, non-Whites and the very youngest cohort aged 18-24. John Della Volpe, the Institute of Politics\u2019 polling director, pointed out that those youngest adults probably don\u2019t remember much about Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cYounger voters today have a different view of Trump,\u201d said Della Volpe, who advised the Biden campaign in 2020 on young voters. \u201cThey were 10, 12, 13 years old when he descended down that escalator, when he blocked Muslims, when he pulled out of Paris [the international climate treaty], when he talked about Charlottesville. They were children. Their values don\u2019t align with his values, but there is less toxicity when you bring up his name. So there is this openness that wasn\u2019t there in the last two elections.\u201d Even as recently as 2020, Della Volpe said, Democrats could target young people with what politicians in the old big-city machines used to call a \u201cblind pull\u201d \u2014 where a party can focus on turning out everyone in a particular neighborhood because such a high percentage of them will reliably vote for them. This year, he said, with young voters, \u201cit\u2019s definitely more complicated. It\u2019s not a blind pull.\u201d Della Volpe\u2019s observation underscores how Trump\u2019s strength among irregular voters could force Democrats to reconsider their tactics. Much of the voter registration and turnout work aimed at minority and young voters has historically operated through liberal non-profit organizations that target the broad population in those groups on the assumption that most of them will ultimately favor Democrats. But this year, some Democratic strategists worry that casting such a wide net could inadvertently mobilize an unusually large number of peripheral voters who favor Trump. That could compel Democrats to switch more of their registration and turnout efforts toward explicitly partisan programs, which can target voters more precisely based on their partisanship, but which are more difficult to raise money for. \u201cYou are hearing more groups struggling because their thesis has been \u2018I take [non-profit] dollars to get, say, all non-White voters\u2019\u201d to register and turnout, said Smith of Civitech. For Republicans, the mirror image imperative is finding ways to organize the irregular Black and Latino voters showing openness to\u00a0Trump. Republicans don\u2019t have much history of courting those voters, and, ironically, any effort to do so may be impeded by the barriers to voting that many Republican-controlled states have erected since 2020. Republicans also face the complication that Trump\u2019s diversion of large amounts of his fundraising toward his legal defense may mean there\u2019s less money available to invest in on-the-ground campaign operations. That may not matter much if the combination of Trump\u2019s ubiquitous media presence and discontent with Biden\u2019s record encourages enough irregular voters open to the former president to turn out in November. Based on the results in 2018, 2020 and 2022, Democrats can feel confident that at least as many habitual voters are hostile to Trump as committed to him, particularly in most of the battleground states that will decide the election. The decisive variable for 2024 may be how many people beyond that inner core of the most reliable voters show up and whether they break for the former president as decisively as most polls now suggest.

{"id": "2024_06_01_politics_mexico-woman-president-what-matters", "text": "While American voters are looking at the same old options in their coming election, Mexican voters will choose between two women as the major-party candidates in their presidential election this weekend. Women in Mexico did not enjoy universal suffrage until 1953, a full 33 years after women gained the right in the US, but the country is almost sure to have its first female leader before the US does. CNN\u2019s Tara John points out in an analysis for CNN International that Mexico\u2019s likely election of a woman as president is \u201ca remarkable achievement in a country known for its patriarchal culture and high rates of gender-based violence, where\u00a0around 10 women\u00a0are murdered every day.\u201d But the breaking of Mexico\u2019s glass ceiling will also be overshadowed by the multifaceted problems of gang violence, targeted politicians and rampant crime. Read more. The influence of women in Mexican politics is evident in other branches of government. Mexico\u2019s Supreme Court elected its first female chief justice in January 2023. Her court also decriminalized abortion in Mexico, an inverse of the US, where five conservatives on the US Supreme Court (four men and one woman) overruled the court\u2019s liberals (two women and one man at that time) to take nationwide abortion rights away from American women in June 2022. Some of the reasons for Mexico\u2019s move toward political gender parity are structural. Mexican law requires political parties there to put equal numbers of women and men up for election. That\u2019s not going to happen in the US. There are also one-term limits on presidents, forcing more turnover. The current front-runner in Mexico\u2019s presidential election, Claudia Sheinbaum, is on the ballot because her party\u2019s popular president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, must step aside. The Supreme Court has a woman as chief justice in part because justices in Mexico serve 15-year terms. I talked to Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, about obstacles American women face in politics. She noted that the progress American women had been making for decades at the state level, beginning in the 1970s, had stalled until after the election of Donald Trump in 2016, when a new generation of American women got active. Since the 2018 midterms\ufeff, though, progress has slowed. Now, according to CAWP\u2019s tally for 2024: Those figures continue to slowly grow, but they are nowhere near gender parity. By comparison, half of the legislators in Mexico\u2019s lower house of Congress are women, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union. In countries with quota systems, the move toward parity has been much quicker, but Walsh said we shouldn\u2019t expect such a system in the US. \u201cThe concept of quotas, as you well know, is sort of antithetical to the American image of pulling themselves up by their bootstraps, the best candidates will rise to the top,\u201d Walsh said. When I asked what obstacles women face in US politics, she rattled off a list. Republicans elect fewer women First, Walsh said, there is an obvious partisan element. More elected women are Democrats, which might seem obvious. But the imbalance is amplified at the state level and in legislatures, where most elected representatives serve. Just picking one state, Georgia, she pointed out that 59% of Democratic legislators are women compared with 16% of Republican legislators. In Florida, two-thirds of Democratic legislators are women compared with less than a third of Republicans. See data for all the states here. Walsh argued that both parties must do a better job of recruiting and supporting women who run for office, and she said it\u2019s important to make sure women are running in seats where they can win, as opposed to seats where they have no chance. Part of the reason for the imbalance is due to policy, but it\u2019s also a matter of priorities in how Republicans recruit candidates, Walsh argued. \u201cThe philosophy of the party generally is the best candidate will rise to the top, and whether it\u2019s a man or a woman or a person of color or a White person, it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she said. Campaign finance is a problem for female candidates The way campaigns are funded is an obstacle, according to Walsh, because women are less likely to be able to fund their own campaigns. \u201cWe know that parties love self-funders, because a self-funding candidate is less of a strain on the party itself in terms of providing support,\u201d she said. She argued that women also tend to raise money in smaller amounts, less than $200, which makes the process of fundraising much more arduous. Politics feels more dangerous \u201cPolitics has gotten particularly ugly, fraught and dangerous,\u201d Walsh said, pointing to the 2020 kidnapping plot against Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Walsh argued that online threats seem to disproportionately affect female officeholders and candidates. That perception could have a chilling effect on women seeking office. Walsh does think the US will ultimately elect a woman as president. \u201cIt\u2019s a frustrating process to see how slow it can be,\u201d she said. Hillary Clinton was the first woman to be a major-party presidential nominee in 2016, and Kamala Harris became the first woman to be elected to nationwide office when she shared the Democratic presidential ticket with Joe Biden in 2020. Notably, Democrats selected Biden from a field that included six women, including Harris, that cycle. Trump could also choose a woman as his running mate for this November\u2019s election. But it seems unlikely that he will pick the only Republican woman to ever win a presidential primary, Nikki Haley, who won contests in Vermont and the District of Columbia this year. When I noted Haley\u2019s success to Walsh as a sign of progress, she countered: \u201cShe\u2019s not the nominee.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/politics/mexico-woman-president-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_politics_immigration-ballot-measure-arizona", "text": "Arizona voters will weigh in this fall on a ballot measure that would allow local law enforcement to arrest migrants who illegally cross the southern border if there is \u201cprobable cause.\u201d State lawmakers on Tuesday approved a bill that will allow the measure to appear on the November ballot. The bill, known as the Secure the Border Act, passed the Republican-controlled Arizona House by a party-line 31-29 vote. Arizona will play a key role this election year, as both a battleground state in the presidential race and home to a Senate race that could help determine the balance of power in the US Senate. Immigration has been a central campaign issue for former President Donald Trump and Republicans in the border state and could drive voters to the polls. If voters approve the measure in November, law enforcement would be enabled to arrest migrants who cross into the US without going through official ports of entry. Judges could order the deportation of those convicted of violating the law. Under the proposal, a person who enters the US illegally cannot be arrested unless there is \u201cprobable cause\u201d \u2013 a law enforcement officer has witnessed the violation, there is a recording of the violation or there is \u201cany other constitutionally sufficient\u201d sign of probable cause. Proponents say the measure would curb illegal immigration and cut down on crime perpetrated by migrants, stepping in where the federal government has failed. Meanwhile, critics argue that the proposal would result in racial profiling and unlawful policing, be costly for the state and strain law enforcement resources. The proposal is similar to Texas\u2019 controversial immigration law known as SB 4, which has been blocked from going into effect as a legal challenge plays out in court. If Arizona voters approve the ballot measure, the part of the proposal that would allow local law enforcement to make arrests for illegal entry cannot be enforced until the Texas immigration law or another state\u2019s law has been in effect for 60 days. The Arizona measure would also create criminal offenses for migrants unlawfully in the US who \u201cknowingly\u201d present false documents to receive public benefits or get around the state\u2019s e-verify program. It would increase punishments for fentanyl sales that result in the death of another. The bill\u2019s final vote in the Arizona legislature fell on the same day that President Joe Biden announced\u00a0new immigration executive actions\u00a0that will allow his administration to ban asylum seekers who cross the border illegally. \u201cWhen the federal government completely withdraws from its responsibility to enforce the law, then it becomes incumbent on the states to take action on that and enforce it themselves,\u201d Republican state Rep. Justin Heap said in remarks Tuesday on the Arizona House floor. \u201cI hear my Democratic colleagues concerned about the cost that may accrue in this. Arizona citizens are already paying costs for illegal immigration every day. They pay it in their housing, they pay it in their utility bills, they paid in their grocery bills, their medical care, their insurance and as we\u2019ve heard today, some of them pay for it with their lives, and with the safety of their communities,\u201d he added. Democrats said the bill hearkens back to the\u00a0Arizona law, Senate Bill 1070,\u00a0that was signed into law more than a decade ago and parts of which were struck down the US Supreme Court. The law, which critics called the \u201cshow me your papers\u201d law, allowed police to check a person\u2019s immigration status during traffic stops if they had \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d to think the person was in the US illegally. \u201cMaricopa County is still paying the price for the last attempt at hateful race-baiting legislation that have now cost taxpayers over $300 million. HCR 2060 will cost us more,\u201d Democratic state Rep. Junelle Cavero said, adding that the bill would create \u201cracial profiling and harassment that will result in lawsuits\u201d and \u201cbroken families.\u201d Republican House Speaker Ben Toma pushed back on the criticism, arguing that there is \u201cno immunity for police discrimination in the bill.\u201d \u201cThe standard in this bill is probable cause, not reasonable suspicion like all the other so-called previous mistakes in other bills,\u201d Toma, the bill\u2019s main sponsor, said on the House floor. \u201cThis cannot be honestly referred to as the \u2018show me your papers\u2019 bill.\u201d Republicans also closed the House gallery to the public during proceedings on Tuesday, citing security concerns \u2013 a move that prompted further criticism from Democrats. The bill was amended and passed by the GOP-led Arizona Senate last month also on a party line vote. In referring the issue to voters, Republicans were able to bypass Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs, who vetoed a similar immigration bill earlier this year and was opposed to HCR 2060. After the bill\u2019s passage, Hobbs again spoke out against the measure, saying it will not secure the US southern border. \u201cDespite strong opposition from business leaders, border law enforcement, and bipartisan local leaders throughout the state, extremists in the legislature have chosen to prioritize their political agendas over finding real solutions,\u201d the governor said in a statement.

But don\u2019t expect committed Donald Trump voters to suddenly waver because their candidate is now a convicted felon. \u201cJust an abuse of the justice system,\u201d Billy Pierce, a semi-retired consultant and Trump backer in\u00a0Hartsville, South Carolina, said shortly after the former president was found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records in his Manhattan hush money trial. \u201cBiden and Democrats can\u2019t win the 2024 election in the polls, so they use prosecution of Trump to try to keep him out of office. This verdict will not hold up through appeals,\u201d he added, repeating Trump\u2019s false claims about President Joe Biden being behind the New York prosecution. Andrew Konchek, a commercial fisherman and Trump\u00a0supporter\u00a0in New Hampshire, responded to the verdict with sarcastic references to former President Bill Clinton\u2019s personal\u00a0scandals. \u201cThere\u2019s no direct evidence and from who, Cohen?\u00a0Who\u2019s a habitual liar and has been disbarred?

I\u2019m just not seeing it in this case.\u201d Iowa Trump supporter Chris Mudd, who owns a solar energy business, said his backing of the former president is solid. \u201cI do think the verdict is bad for America,\u201d Mudd said in a text. \u201cCan\u2019t believe this is happening in this country.\u201d Betsy Sarcone was a Nikki Haley voter in the Iowa caucuses and late last year said she would vote Biden if it ended up a Biden-Trump rematch. But she has shifted dramatically since the caucuses. \u201cI\u2019ve been following this sideshow semi closely,\u201d she said after the jury verdict that gave Trump a place in history as the first former president or presumptive party nominee convicted of a felony. \u201cThis does not impact my plans to vote Republican. I don\u2019t even like Donald Trump and this was a witch hunt, made up crimes on the part of the judge and DA. It will never stand on appeal. \u2026 I actually don\u2019t think it will hurt him. People are so sick of the sideshows to distract/avoid/gaslight people away from the real problems in this country.\u00a0To be clear, I\u2019m still not a Trump fan, but it\u2019s pretty clear these cases are being motivated politically.\u201d Pierce, Konchek, Sarcone and Katsanos are all\u00a0participating in a CNN project to follow the 2024 election through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds or are part of key voting blocs.\u00a0We will check back as news of the historic 34 count conviction sinks in, and as the former president prepares to be sentenced in July \u2013\u00a0days before he is to be officially nominated for president at the Republican National Convention. But our conversations before and during the trial were eye opening: the overwhelming majority of the Trump supporters in our voter groups viewed the cases against the former president \u2014 especially the Manhattan one \u2014 as politically motivated. (The former president pleaded not guilty in this and three other looming criminal cases.) Even many Republicans who are not Trump fans share the view\u00a0that he\u00a0is being unfairly targeted.\u00a0Biden supporters, on the other hand, saw the verdicts as Trump finally being held accountable for what they see as a lifetime of cheating and lying. Matt Vrahiotes, a Christian conservative who runs a fruit winery in\u00a0Hall\u00a0County, Georgia, was troubled by the charges in the Manhattan case: falsifying business records to hide hush money payments to an adult film star, allegedly to help the 2016 Trump campaign. \u201cI mean it sounds crazy, its sounds like an irresponsible person, an irresponsible thing to do,\u201d Vrahiotes said in April. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of things going on with both candidates, and a lot of things that are morally in question for both of them, so,\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0really hard for me to say, oh don\u2019t like one candidate because of what\u2019s going on, versus promoting another. You know, you got to let the trial go through, you\u2019ve got to let the judge decide what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong, and\u00a0I\u2019ll\u00a0go from there.\u201d Jan Gardner, a Trump backer who lives in Dunwoody, an Atlanta suburb, said before the verdict that he has lost faith in the justice system. \u201cDo we feel that some of the things that go on, that there\u2019s a double standard?\u201d Gardner asked, mentioning Hillary Clinton, who, in his view, was treated differently than Trump. \u201d I have questions about the \u2026 how much in honesty and how much power can buy you things.\u201d Republican and likely Trump voter Devin McIver\u00a0said he did not closely follow the trial but would not be putting \u201ctime or energy\u201d into thinking about Trump being found guilty, writing in a text that he believes he was \u201cbetter off when Trump was president.\u201d Uneasy about Trump, but not sold on the Manhattan case We hear the unfairness argument a lot in our travels, even from Republicans who are Trump critics. Linda Rooney is a Haley supporter from Media, Pennsylvania, wrestling with whether to cast a reluctant Trump vote or write in the former South Carolina governor or someone else. Rooney has \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about Trump being convicted, telling us she didn\u2019t think the case had \u201cmerit\u201d but saying she\u2019d \u201clove to see him behind bars but for one of the many other things he\u2019s done. Like the White House records case or January 6.\u201d She said she hoped that with\u00a0the conviction, Trump would\u00a0\u201cbow out of the race on his own now and let someone more suitable run \u2014 like Nikki Haley.\u201d But she acquiesced, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s in Donald Trump to bow out.\u201d Similarly, fellow Pennsylvania voter Irma Fralic, who voted for Haley in the primary, sees politics behind the Manhattan case. \u201cThe current trial in New York, it\u2019s totally political,\u201d Fralic told us last week at her Montgomery County home. \u201cI looked briefly at some of those things, and it just doesn\u2019t hold water.\u201d Former Trump voter Joan London had a mixed take on the convictions. She was a Republican for more than 40 years, switching her registration to independent after casting a vote for Haley in the April Pennsylvania primary. She left the GOP because of Trump. London, an attorney, said she expected a \u201cmore mixed verdict\u201d because \u201cPresident Trump didn\u2019t sign all of the checks that were at issue, and Michael Cohen\u2019s past history of lying and stealing.\u201d Still, London said, \u201cThis verdict has no impact on my voting plans.\u00a0Still no plans to vote for either Trump or Biden.\u201d Celebration and some caution among Biden voters Darrell Ann Murphy offered a reaction typical of the Biden supporters in our voter groups. \u201cWow! A great day,\u201d said Murphy, who lives in Northampton County, Pennsylvania. \u201cFinally he\u2019s found guilty!! Friends texting me like crazy all happy. Lots of Biden voters I talk to.\u201d Pat Levin, another Biden voter in Northampton County, said of the verdict: \u201cIt supports and reinforces I believe in the rule of Law.\u00a0It supports my attitude towards the limits of executive power.\u00a0It reinforces my belief in the tenets of democracy. They have a strong judicial system.\u00a0I am enormously grateful to this jury and its seriousness of purpose.\u201d David Moore is a registered Republican in Nogales, Arizona, but plans to vote for Biden because he cannot support Trump. He responded to the verdict with a question: \u201cCan he still run if he\u2019s in appeals?\u201d Yes, the conviction does not preclude Trump from running. \u201cI\u2019m not counting chickens,\u201d Moore said. \u201cA lot of folks around me seem very happy about it. I\u2019m curious to see how this all goes.\u201d Recent University of Michigan graduate Jade Gray was a co-president of the College Democrats on campus. \u201cFrom the minute he was elected it was historical for all of the wrong reasons,\u201d she said of\u00a0Trump. \u201cBeing the first president who is a convicted solidifies that legacy.\u00a0This is what accountability looks like. I know it\u2019s said a lot, but no one is above the law and Trump has repeatedly shown himself to be a crooked, untrustworthy person.\u201d Nanette Mees, a Republican but Trump critic who lives in suburban Loudon County, Virginia, offered this: \u201cPersonally I am thrilled he was found guilty and pray that there are no big riots because of his followers.\u201d And Joanna Brooks, a Black voter who runs a yoga studio in suburban Milwaukee, described herself as \u201cshocked but happy. \u2026 It\u2019s bizarre to me that this wouldn\u2019t necessarily impact his run for presidency. He will appeal and play victim and his supporters will probably love him all the more.\u201d Deep divide among voters The sharp divide was again evident as more reactions from voters flowed in Friday morning. Trump supporter Rachel Kulak, a Christian conservative who lives in the Richmond, Virginia, suburbs called the verdict \u201cderanged\u201d and part of a justice system she views as warped by Democrats. \u201cBiden\u00a0cannot win in \u201824 so we have weaponization, lawfare against Trump,\u201d Kulak said, comparing the case to political prosecutions in Russia and Venezuela. \u201cTo not be able to trust the legal system according to our own laws, to know that it is not blind but being used to further the agenda of ruining our country, we are in a dangerous place. I do not recognize America for America anymore.\u201d Attorney Priscilla Forsyth of Sioux City, Iowa, was a Haley supporter in the Iowa caucuses but said Trump has her \u201ccomplete support\u201d now. \u201cI am very sad about what this has done to our criminal justice system and very angry that the system I have given 38 years of my life to was perverted into an attempt to destroy a political opponent,\u201d Forsyth said. \u201cI feel it was a travesty of justice and it makes me sick to my stomach.\u201d \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republicans and Democrats, however, voiced gratitude at the convictions. Angela Lang, a community organizer in Milwaukee, said the convictions might help her canvassers when they encounter voters who are considering voting for Trump. \u201cThese are more facts to talk about when we talk to voters,\u201d Lang said. \u201cOne of our\u00a0ambassadors mentioned that we have to make sure people know about this and what this actually means. It\u2019s not just \u2018he slept with a porn star,\u2019 it\u2019s deeper and how it tried to impact the 2016 election.\u201d Zoila Sanchez, a Las Vegas real estate agent who describes herself as a Reagan Republican, said she followed the trial closely. \u201cAlthough I believed he was guilty, I thought he might be acquitted due to his remarkable luck,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cI am\u00a0pleased\u00a0that our legal system has once again prevailed.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reaction.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/politics/voters-trump-conviction-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_georgia-trump-fani-willis-trial-delay", "text": "A Georgia appeals court has halted the election subversion conspiracy case against Donald Trump and several of his co-defendants \u2013 a massive victory for the former president seeking to push further legal issues until 2025 if he can\u2019t beat them altogether. The new order filed on Wednesday from the Georgia Court of Appeals is the latest indication that a trial in the state-level Georgia election subversion case will not occur before the 2024 presidential election. The court said the case will be on hold until a panel of judges rules on whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis should be disqualified. The appeals court is expected to rule on the disqualification issue by March 2025, though it could issue a ruling sooner. Several\u00a0sources close to the case have told CNN that the timeline remains very uncertain. Fulton County Superior Judge Scott McAfee had initially allowed proceedings in his courtroom to continue as the appeals court weighed an appeal of his decision to allow Willis to remain on the case. A spokesperson for Willis\u2019 office said they can\u2019t comment on the appeals court\u2019s order at this point. The DA can ask the appeals court to fast track a decision in this matter if it chooses. The appeals court\u2019s decision underscores Trump\u2019s series of successes in his long-running strategy to put prosecutors on the defensive, attack them in the public sphere and challenge them in court. Trump and some of his co-defendants in the sprawling racketeering case have been trying to get Willis disqualified from the case because of a romantic relationship she had with Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor she hired to help handle the case. The defendants argued that Willis financially benefited from the relationship with Wade, who defense attorneys say covered several vacations for the pair. In March, after what amounted to a mini-trial where attorneys for Trump and his co-defendants sought to prove their case against Willis and Wade, McAfee found there was not enough evidence to firmly prove Willis financially benefited from the relationship. Willis\u2019 testimony in televised proceedings put her personal life in the spotlight, turning discussion away from the charges Trump and others face in Georgia. The judge ultimately decided Willis would be allowed to continue to helm the case if Wade stepped down, which he later did. Steve Sadow, Trump\u2019s lead defense counsel in Georgia, said the ruling was proper. \u201cThe Georgia Court of Appeals has properly stayed all proceedings against President Trump in the trial court pending its decision on our interlocutory appeal which argues the case should be dismissed and Fulton County DA Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct,\u201d Sadow said in a statement. Florida delays help Trump as well Meanwhile, in Trump\u2019s classified documents case in Florida, the federal judge overseeing those proceedings has shown propensity to devote large amounts of in-court time to Trump\u2019s requests to question investigators and his prosecutors\u2019 authority. That judge, Aileen Cannon, indicated on Wednesday she still appears to be willing to hold a hearing where Trump could attempt to put federal investigators under oath so his attorneys could question them, and said she\u2019ll dedicate a day and a half this month to hearing arguments about the legality of his prosecutor. Like the Georgia case, the Florida documents case has no set trial date.

{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_bob-nadine-menendez-mercedes", "text": "Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez\u2019s federal corruption trial continued Wednesday with an FBI special agent reading text messages from a New Jersey businessman who is alleged to have made payments on a Mercedes-Benz convertible for the senator\u2019s wife. FBI special agent Rachel Graves combed through countless text messages and documents from 2018 and 2019 detailing Jose Uribe\u2019s involvement in the bribery scheme. Uribe was indicted alongside Menendez but struck a plea deal with federal prosecutors earlier this year. Under the terms of the deal, he pleaded guilty to seven counts and agreed to testify in the government\u2019s case. Bob and Nadine Menendez, along with New Jersey businessmen Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, are accused of engaging in a bribery scheme and acting as foreign agents for the Egyptian government. All four have pleaded not guilty. Nadine Menendez will be tried separately this summer. Prosecutor Paul Michael Monteleoni spent Wednesday morning in federal court in New York unraveling the complex web of communication that allegedly led to Nadine Menendez\u2019s ownership of a Mercedes-Benz C300 convertible car. Prosecutors allege that Uribe made payments for the car in exchange for the senator\u2019s help in influencing New Jersey state criminal prosecutions of two Uribe associates. One of them, Elvis Parra, was charged with insurance fraud in New Jersey. Evidence showed Uribe frequently texted and called Hana and Nadine Menendez, who prosecutors say was the intermediary for communications to the senator. In April 2018, Uribe texted Hana that \u201cthe deal is to kill and stop all investigation I am talking to Andy and he is falling asleep,\u201d referring to the investigation into Parra and to Andy Aslanian, a New Jersey attorney and associate of Nadine Menendez who was present at meetings with the senator, Hana and Egyptian officials. By October 2018, however, Uribe appeared to have grown worried over his involvement, texting Hana, \u201cI am f**ked man\u201d and \u201cthe whole thing is going bad. I have no face to talk to my family.\u201d On October 13, 2018, Uribe texted Hana, \u201cMorning sir, please make sure your friend knows about this, just as a last favor.\u201d Prosecutors allege that the \u201cfriend\u201d in question was a reference to either Bob or Nadine Menendez. \u201cI will,\u201d Hana replied. The texts discussing Parra continued through 2019. In January, Nadine, who was Menendez\u2019s girlfriend at the time, asked Hana, \u201cI need to know what the charges are.\u201d Hana replied, \u201cthe matter only involves four counts\u201d and is \u201ca relatively small indictment.\u201d A few minutes later, Nadine called the senator. Texts from March 2019 revealed further worries for Uribe. On March 5, he texted Hana, \u201cCan\u2019t even sleep.\u201d A week later, he told an associate after an 18-minute call with Nadine that \u201cThey are saying everything is done.\u201d Uribe texted Nadine days later, \u201cI am trusting you.\u201d Meanwhile, in February 2019, Hana asked Daibes by text if he could \u201cplease help \u2026 with car.\u201d A day later, Nadine texted Hana, \u201call is great I am so excited to get a car next week.\u201d Prosecutors have alleged that Nadine Menendez needed a new car, apparently after hitting and killing a jaywalker in Bogota, New Jersey, in December 2018. A police report was filed but she faced no charges. On March 31, 2019, Nadine texted the senator photos of two different Mercedes-Benz cars and asked which he preferred. Menendez replied, \u201clike them both whatever you prefer.\u201d But Nadine soon grew upset with Hana because she said he\u2019d left for Egypt for a week and she hadn\u2019t obtained a car, according to texts. In a March 31 text, she told Uribe, \u201cI just found out Wael left for Egypt yesterday. I am very hurt and disappointed by him but I should not be surprised.\u201d Uribe texted her back, \u201cI was hoping to meet with you \u2026 I am worried but I have to face whatever comes my way.\u201d The two then had a 22-minute phone call and a little over an hour later, Nadine texted Menendez that Uribe had made a call to \u201cmake the arrangements for my car.\u201d On April 5, 2019, Nadine texted the senator, \u201cCongratulations mon amour de la vie we are the proud owners of a 2019 Mercedes.\u201d The federal indictment alleges that Nadine Menendez obtained $15,000 in cash from Uribe in a parking lot the day before she picked the vehicle up and put $15,000 as a down payment. Uribe is alleged to have then hidden his monthly financing payments for the vehicle. Later, following an FBI raid on the Menendez home, Nadine would write Uribe a $21,000 check, which prosecutors say was an effort at cleanup and to make the gift look like a loan. Uribe is scheduled to be sentenced on June 14. CNN\u2019s Zachary B.

{"id": "2024_05_29_politics_haley-voters-pennsylvania-trump", "text": "Joan London is carrying a 40-year-old newspaper, its edges frayed and turning yellow. She beams as she unfolds it to show a black and white photograph of her earliest political activism \u2014 holding a 1984 Reagan-Bush campaign sign. On her phone, more GOP pride: photos of London at a rally for a Republican candidate for Pennsylvania governor and in Washington, DC, for a Tea Party event during the Obama presidency. \u201cWhen I was 18, I registered as a Republican,\u201d London said. \u201cI\u2019ve been a Republican for many years until a month ago when I changed by registration from Republican to Independent.\u201d Just before the switch, one last ballot cast as a Republican: a vote for Nikki Haley in Pennsylvania\u2019s April presidential primary, even though the former South Carolina governor had bowed out of the race seven weeks earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s time to pass the baton to a new generation in the Republican Party, and I felt that she was it,\u201d London told CNN in an interview. She cast her Haley protest vote, then left Donald Trump\u2019s GOP. \u201cI have a different vision of what conservatism is,\u201d London said. \u201cI came up in the 80s under (Ronald) Reagan. I\u2019ve always had a very positive vision of self-sufficiency and personal responsibility. \u2026 I\u2019m seeing a change more toward populism which carries some unpleasant baggage, which I didn\u2019t see myself as part of. Didn\u2019t see it reflecting my values.\u201d London is hardly alone. Haley garnered nearly 17% of the primary vote statewide this year \u2014 approaching 25% in the suburban collar counties around Philadelphia. More than 155,000 votes in all \u2014 a potentially decisive bloc in a presidential battleground that Trump carried by 44,292 votes in 2016 and Joe Biden won by 81,660 in 2020. Our conversation with London is part of a CNN project designed to follow the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in the battleground states and are critical to deciding the outcome. London is an attorney in Berks County. The shift as you drive northwest from the Philly suburbs is unmistakable. First the farms and silos, then the Trump flags. He carried Berks County by 10 points in 2016 and 8 points in 2020. But even here, Haley received nearly 16% in the primary \u2014 votes Trump can ill afford to lose come November. London\u2019s is all but certainly lost. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself voting for Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself voting for Biden.\u201d For now, her plan is to either skip the presidential line on the ballot or write in a conservative. She knows the math: any subtraction hurts Trump. \u201cI believe we have to send a message that the Republican Party needs to go in a different direction,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a principled position I need to take.\u201d Irma Fralic, too, cast her primary vote for Haley as a protest. \u201cI want a country that is normal,\u201d Fralic said. \u201cI want a country that functions and I want people to be together.\u201d She is the daughter of Cuban immigrants, a staunch supporter of Israel and a Reagan Republican who saw Haley as tough and principled on foreign policy. Now? \u201cI\u2019m not happy with the options, no,\u201d Fralic said. \u201cOne is in court. And the other one is \u2013 I feel bad for him. If he was my father, I\u2019d say, \u2018You might want to reconsider your life.\u2019 I don\u2019t know. And the other one, I would say, \u2018You might want to prioritize your personal problems.\u2019\u201d Our visit to Pennsylvania coincided with Haley announcing she will vote for Trump in November despite significant differences with the presumptive GOP nominee. Haley also said in her announcement last week she wished Trump would make a direct effort to court her supporters. Fralic said Haley\u2019s decision to vote for Trump would not automatically sway her. But she offered this: \u201cThe best way for Trump to reach out to me and the millions who voted for Nikki Haley is to choose her as VP. If that\u2019s the ticket, they have my vote.\u201d London was more muted in her response. \u201cMy respect for Ambassador Haley has not changed whether or not I agree with her choice,\u201d London said in a text exchange. Eyeing Trump, but holding her nose Linda Rooney cast her Haley vote in the primary as a question as much as a protest. \u201cWho are the people in the Republican Party that keep shoving this down our throats right now?\u201d Rooney said. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we elect someone normal? You know, someone who is diplomatic.\u201d Rooney is a registered Republican who voted Trump in 2016 then Biden in 2020. But she has ruled out voting for Biden again. \u201cI don\u2019t trust him with the economy,\u201d said Rooney, who runs a digital communications business from her home in Media, in suburban Delaware County. Rooney\u2019s son serves in the Army. \u201cI\u2019m angry about Afghanistan, about that withdrawal. So, honestly, I can\u2019t vote for him.\u201d Rooney framed her 2024 debate this way: \u201cI can write someone in, or I can just hold my nose and vote for Trump and know that\u2019s only going to be four more years.\u201d Later, in a text exchange, Rooney said, \u201cHaley would be a good VP and possibly keep him in check.\u201d\u00a0Her reaction to the former governor saying she\u2019d vote for Trump was perhaps revealing of where Rooney will end up. \u201cI think Haley is in the same boat as the rest of us who don\u2019t want Trump as our nominee,\u201d Rooney texted. \u201cShe\u2019s just holding her nose earlier than the rest of us.\u201d That Rooney would even consider Trump speaks volumes about her disappointment in Biden. She called Trump\u2019s conduct on January 6, 2021, appalling. \u201cI was angry that Trump didn\u2019t say something,\u201d she said. \u201cThat Trump didn\u2019t stop it. \u2026 So, you know, I just can\u2019t forgive him for that.\u201d She also works as a borough elections monitor and rolled her eyes when told that Trump again recently insisted he won Pennsylvania in 2020. \u201cNo,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cNo.\u201d A veteran who wants anyone but Trump Michael Pesce lives in Bucks County and works in a meat processing plant. He has been a registered Republican for 40 years. \u201cMy first election, presidential election, was 1984,\u201d Pesce said in an interview at his Doylestown home. \u201cI became a Republican when I turned 18 because of Ronald Reagan.\u201d His parents were Democrats. \u201cAt the time, they were, like, \u2018We\u2019re Democrats. We\u2019re not Republicans.\u2019 I was like, \u2018No, no, no, I\u2019m a Reagan Republican.\u201d Pesce is a Coast Guard veteran who voted Trump in 2016 but Biden in 2020. This year? \u201cIf I had my choice, I wouldn\u2019t vote for either,\u201d said Pesce, who backed Haley in the April primary. \u201cBut I will vote for Biden. I will vote for anyone but Trump.\u201d Why? \u201cSo, he tried to overthrow our government, and that\u2019s a problem with me,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cServed in the US military. I just have very strong feelings about what it means to be an American.\u201d Pesce has little patience for those who believe Trump can do no wrong. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear that, Ok, he could be a convicted criminal in a couple of days,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear that he did all these things.\u201d Pesce said he was \u201cgreatly disappointed\u201d to hear of Haley\u2019s decision to support Trump. \u201cI think she is looking ahead four years,\u201d he said. But it won\u2019t sway him. \u201cI\u2019m a Republican. I\u2019m a conservative,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cI think we spend a lot of money on stuff we don\u2019t need to spend money on.\u201d Yet he will vote Biden and hopes many others among the more than 150,000 Pennsylvania Republicans who cast votes for Haley in the primary will do the same. \u201cIf enough of us Republicans can do the right thing, keep Trump out of office, the next four years aren\u2019t going to be perfect,\u201d Pesce said. \u201cBut I think they are going to be better than the alternative.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/politics/haley-voters-pennsylvania-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "politics"}}

He has survived tough races before, but his bid for a third term is sure to be among the nation\u2019s most competitive \u2014 particularly with Trump, who won the state by 16 points in 2020,\u00a0at the top of the ticket.\u00a0Since 2012, only one senator has won reelection in a presidential year from a state that voted for the opposite party\u2019s White House nominee \u2013 Maine Republican Susan Collins in 2020. The advertising war between Tester and Sheehy has already heated up in Montana. Sheehy this week became the first Republican to go on the air with an ad linking his Democratic rival to\u00a0Trump\u2019s recent conviction in his New York hush money trial. \u201cThey want to throw Trump in jail, trying to rob Americans of their choice in the election, and Jon Tester is standing right by their side,\u201d a narrator says in the spot. Over the weekend, Tester became the latest Democrat to launch a campaign ad highlighting burn pit legislation from 2022, an effort to support veterans that\u2019s become a go-to messaging tool for some of the party\u2019s most vulnerable members this year. The new ad\u00a0highlights the PACT Act, which was\u00a0enacted\u00a0in 2022 with bipartisan support and included provisions to support veterans who were exposed to toxic burn pits during their military service. \u201cMontana veterans know, Jon Tester stands up for us,\u201d the ad says, featuring a crowd of servicemembers appearing with the senator. The ad notes that Tester helped \u201cveterans with toxic exposure finally get the care we need.\u201d Sheehy, a Minnesota native and first-time candidate, has also been airing ads that seek to introduce himself to Montana and talk up his business record. Those efforts come\u00a0as Democrats have\u00a0attacked him\u00a0as a carpetbagger and\u00a0criticized\u00a0his business practices.\u00a0Multiple outside groups have been targeting Sheehy on TV, running ads that accuse him of threatening access to public lands and operating a \u201chobby ranch.\u201d \u201cTim Sheehy\u2019s got no Montana roots and no idea what we\u2019re all about,\u201d one ad says. Sheehy has defended his record, saying in a spot that\u00a0he \u201cbuilt a Montana manufacturing business with zero dependence on China.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s Tester done? On Tester\u2019s watch, China has stolen our jobs, and Chinese ownership of Montana farmland has soared,\u201d\u00a0he says in the ad. Foreshadowing the highly competitive race to come, both parties have major fall advertising reservations on the books in Montana. Including campaigns and outside groups, the total is over $112 million, with about $56 million for each party. That ranks second among all Senate contests this year, trailing only Ohio, the other state where a Democratic incumbent is seeking reelection in a state Trump twice carried.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/politics/montana-senate-race/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "politics"}}

CIA Director Bill Burns, who has served as the administration\u2019s primary interlocutor in ceasefire negotiations, is meeting Qatari leaders in Doha to receive an update on their conversations with Hamas leaders, according to national security adviser Jake Sullivan. Qatar is acting as an intermediary in talks between Israel and Hamas. Sullivan also said that the US remains in hourly contact with the Qataris as they await a formal response from Hamas. \u201cNow, we are waiting for a response from Hamas,\u201d Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One. \u201cWe will regard a formal\u00a0response as one that gets conveyed to the Qataris, who were the ones who transmitted the proposal from the Israeli negotiators to Hamas.\u201d Middle East Coordinator Brett\u00a0McGurk\u00a0is headed to Cairo this week, according to a source familiar. Egypt, alongside Qatar, has played a significant mediating role in the fraught negotiations. McGurk\u2019s visit comes as tensions have grown between Egypt and Israel in recent months, particularly as Egypt has repeatedly warned Israeli forces against moving forward with a military operation into Rafah. Last month, an Egyptian security worker was killed on the border with Gaza in a shooting between Egyptian and Israeli soldiers. The situation at the Rafah border crossing, as well as post-war planning, are also on the agenda for McGurk\u2019s meetings this week with regional leaders, the source said. McGurk is currently not expected to travel to Israel during this trip. Although both regularly travel to the Middle East, their visits come amid a furious diplomatic push by President Joe Biden and his administration to get Hamas and Israel to accept the latest ceasefire proposal. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has made a flurry of calls since Biden outlined the proposal in a speech last Friday, discussing the ambitious deal with partners and urging them to pressure Hamas to support it. The top US diplomat has spoken twice with the Saudi foreign minister, as well as with his counterparts from Jordan, Turkey, Qatar, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco and Algeria. He also spoke with Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. The United States on Monday circulated a draft UN Security Council resolution to support the proposal and calling for it to insist that Hamas accept the deal. Biden on Friday laid out a three-phase proposal that would pair a release of hostages with a \u201cfull and complete ceasefire,\u201d a plan he said presented the best hope to bring peace to Gaza. The president characterized it as an Israeli proposal. But less than an hour after Biden detailed the proposal, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u00a0insisted Israel will not end the war in Gaza until it had achieved all of its goals, including the destruction of Hamas. The United States has not seen any response yet from Hamas to the latest ceasefire proposal, a State Department spokesperson said on Tuesday. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any response yet from Hamas, but we do think it is important that the international community and, I think quite importantly, countries in the Arab world have spoken out to call on this deal to be finalized and Hamas to accept it,\u201d State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said at a press briefing. Hamas released a statement last week saying that it viewed the proposal \u201cpositively.\u201d Miller did not know if the proposal itself has reached Yahya Sinwar, Hamas\u2019 leader in Gaza. Miller also said that the Israeli government has communicated to the US that they are ready to implement the ceasefire deal should Hamas accept. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t voices inside Israel, and voices even inside the Israeli government are opposed to it, but the government, speaking on behalf of the government, has said they support this proposal and are ready to stand behind that,\u201d Miller said.

{"id": "2024_06_04_politics_trump-mail-in-early-voting", "text": "The Trump campaign on Tuesday announced a new program aimed at promoting absentee, mail-in and early in-person voting \u2013 practices that former President Donald Trump has disparaged for years while promoting false claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election. The new effort, dubbed \u201cSwamp The Vote USA,\u201d comes as\u00a0Republican officials ramp up calls for their voter base to embrace early voting and vote by mail options ahead of November\u2019s election. The new initiative is part of \u201cTrump Force 47,\u201d\u00a0which is sponsored by the Republican National\u00a0Committee and is focused on turning out voters in battleground states. It marks a sharp reversal from Trump\u2019s repeated calls to end the practice of mail-in voting altogether and his discouragement of Republicans from voting any other way but at the polls on Election Day. \u201cRepublicans must win and we will use every appropriate tool to beat the Democrats because they are destroying our country.\u00a0Whether you vote absentee, by mail, early in-person or on election day, we are going to protect the vote.\u00a0We make sure your ballot is secure and your voice is heard,\u201d Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said in a statement Tuesday. After being projected the winner of the Iowa caucuses in January, Trump had declared in his victory speech: \u201cWe\u00a0have\u00a0to\u00a0get\u00a0rid\u00a0of\u00a0mail-in\u00a0ballots\u00a0because\u00a0once\u00a0you\u00a0have\u00a0mail-in\u00a0ballots,\u00a0you\u00a0have\u00a0crooked\u00a0elections.\u201d And Trump, after becoming the presumptive nominee, said in an interview with Britain\u2019s GB News in March that \u201cany time the mail is involved, you\u2019re going to have cheating.\u201d But as Republican officials urge the former president to embrace the voting methods ahead of November, Trump has made conflicting statements on the voting practices, oscillating between casting doubt and encouraging them. Trump posted on his social media site Truth Social last month, \u201cABSENTEE VOTING, EARLY VOTING, AND ELECTION DAY VOTING ARE ALL GOOD OPTIONS. REPUBLICANS MUST MAKE A PLAN, REGISTER, AND VOTE!\u201d The Trump-backed chairman of the RNC, Michael\u00a0Whatley,\u00a0has said encouraging Republican voters to vote early and by mail are \u201ctop priorities\u201d this election cycle.\u00a0Lara Trump, the co-chair of the RNC and Trump\u2019s daughter-in-law, has also publicly advocated for the GOP to embrace the practices. The new program builds on the RNC\u2019s\u00a0\u201cBank Your Vote\u201d campaign that was launched last year.

{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_takeaways-hunter-biden-day-3", "text": "The third day of the Hunter Biden trial saw his ex-wife and an ex-girlfriend testify\u00a0in vivid detail about his drug addiction. Also introduced\u00a0as evidence Wednesday\u00a0was the gun Biden bought in October 2018 that\u2019s at the center of the charges against him. The salesman who sold Biden the gun testified that he saw him fill out the federal form\u00a0on which\u00a0he\u2019s accused of falsely claiming\u00a0he wasn\u2019t using drugs. As the day wrapped up, prosecut\ufeffors announced that they have a half-dozen \u201cshorter\u201d\u00a0witnesses remaining\u00a0and might be prepared to rest their case as soon as\u00a0Thursday afternoon. After that, Biden\u2019s defense lawyers can put on a case\u00a0if they want to. Here\u2019s what to know from Day 3: A tale of two exes When Biden\u2019s ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, who prosecutors subpoenaed to testify, took the witness stand, members of the jury sat up straight in their seats, leaned in and started tuning in. But Buhle\u2019s brief, staccato answers and subdued tone didn\u2019t seem to pull in the jurors. Buhle told the jury that in 2018, she found drug paraphernalia in Hunter\u2019s car, which she checked occasionally because she wanted to make sure there wasn\u2019t anything illegal in the vehicle \u201cwhen my daughters would use his car.\u201d\u00a0However, Buhle couldn\u2019t pinpoint exactly when in 2018 she found paraphernalia in Hunter\u2019s car. Zoe Kestan, another one of Hunter\u2019s former romantic partners, proved to be a much more captivating witness for the jury.\u00a0She described months of partying, clubbing and helping him score drugs from California to Rhode Island. Biden also gave her a brief wave when she identified him in court. Her delivery was animated, and she volunteered interesting details in her answers, sprinkling in the names of upscale restaurants that they dined at in New York City and which fancy hotels they stayed at in Los Angeles. It seemed like some of the jurors were hanging on every word she said. More importantly for the prosecutors\u2019 case, Kestan provided direct eyewitness testimony of Hunter Biden doing drugs as late as mid-September 2018, several weeks before he bought the gun. She said she watched him smoking crack during one of their liaisons in Malibu. This is the closest that prosecutors have come so far to connecting the timeline of Hunter\u2019s drug use to his gun purchase. The \u2018whale hunter\u2019 The salesman who sold Hunter the gun, Gordon Cleveland, testified as a prosecution witness and told the jury that he watched Hunter Biden mark \u201cno\u201d on the question of whether he was a user of illegal drugs. That is essential testimony for the special counsel. Counts 1 and 2 of the three-count felony indictment are tied directly to Hunter\u2019s alleged false statement on that form about his drug use. Later, when he was cross-examined by Biden\u2019s attorney Abbe Lowell, Cleveland embraced his reputation as a \u201cwhale hunter,\u201d chuckling when Lowell brought up the term and bragging about his ability to close deals for pricey guns. Lowell is pursuing this line of inquiry because in opening statements he told the jury that Cleveland essentially peddled the gun to Biden. \u201cI could sell whatever you had. It\u2019s just what I did,\u201d Cleveland said, explaining why his colleagues called him a whale hunter. This included attempts to push his customers to buy more expensive guns, he conceded. But Cleveland said he did that because the pricier guns are more reliable and high quality and wouldn\u2019t try to sell \u201cjunk\u201d to customers. He \u201cwas making the same pay\u201d if someone was buying a gun or not. More embarrassing Hunter photos Pictures of a hotel room that Hunter Biden shared with Kestan in 2018 were shown to the jury. Kestan pointed out several crack pipes, one of which was broken, as well as baking powder, spoons, bowls and chop sticks \u2013 all used for the drugs he was taking and the cocaine he was cooking into crack, she testified. Prosecutors showed a photo of Hunter Biden wearing a shirt that said \u201cADDICTED,\u201d with an Adidas logo that was made to look like a marijuana plant. \u201cI thought that was funny because he didn\u2019t smoke weed,\u201d Kestan said. Another image shown to the jury was of Hunter Biden in a bathtub holding what Kestan said was a crackpipe. What\u2019s next? In opening statements, prosecutors signaled a specific order for their expected witnesses, and they suggested that after Buhle and Kestan testified, they\u2019d put Hallie Biden, the widow of Beau Biden, on the stand. However, after Kestan finished, prosecutors moved on to Gordon, to testify about the gun sale. It\u2019s not clear what may have motivated the potential order adjustment, and it\u2019s still expected that Hallie will testify, perhaps on Thursday, as prosecutors wind down their case. But there was high anticipation for Hallie\u2019s testimony on Wednesday. After all, she represents Biden family drama \u2013 after losing Beau to brain cancer in 2015, she started dating his brother Hunter, who \u201cintroduced\u201d her to crack cocaine, which she later started using herself. In addition to Hallie Biden, prosecutors are aiming to present testimony from several federal agents, including DEA officials who can describe various drug lingo that came up in Hunter Biden\u2019s texts.

{"id": "2024_04_09_politics_rfk-jr-campaign-official-january-6-trump", "text": "A New York-based campaign official for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. who raised the possibility that voting for the independent presidential candidate would help Donald Trump defeat President Joe Biden previously promoted false claims that the 2020 election was rigged\u00a0and attended \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rallies after the election,\u00a0including\u00a0the rally on January 6, 2021, in Washington, DC, that preceded the deadly riot at the US Capitol. Rita Palma, who has identified herself as the Kennedy campaign\u2019s state director in New York, also\u00a0repeatedly called\u00a0Trump her \u201cfavorite president,\u201d according to tweets along with comments she posted on\u00a0the conservative social media site Parler that have since been made private. According to a KFILE examination of those now-private posts, Palma also posed for a photo at the former Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, alongside Sidney Powell \u2013 the pro-Trump attorney who pleaded guilty in Georgia\u2019s election subversion case. In February 2021,\u00a0Palma tweeted her support\u00a0for Trump as a presidential candidate in 2024 and even asked whether he could run for a third term in 2028 \u2013 which is not constitutionally allowed as a president can serve only two full terms. \u201c#Trump2024 Can he run in 2028 too?\u201d she tweeted, posting a meme that said she would vote for\u00a0Trump in 2024. In one comment, Palma dismissed suggestions from then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that Trump was to blame for violence at the Capitol. \u201cActually the fault lies with the rigged election. Genius,\u201d she\u00a0wrote\u00a0the day after the riot. There is no indication Palma went to the Capitol or was violent on January 6, but tweets from that day show her in DC for Trump\u2019s rally. Palma later dismissed that day\u2019s violence as the work of a few attendees. \u201cJan 6 was not a riot. A small group of people were trouble. It was 99.9 peaceful, respectful. I was there,\u201d\u00a0she wrote. CNN reviewed Palma\u2019s now-private tweets on the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, where\u00a0she included the hashtag #BidenCheated 86 times from November 2020 to February 2021. Palma\u2019s promotion and attendance at \u201cStop the Steal\u201d events after the 2020 election reflects a segment of support Kennedy has received from Trump supporters, particularly as a means of helping the former president retake the White House in 2024. One of the\u00a0biggest donors\u00a0to Kennedy\u2019s super PAC, Timothy Mellon, is also a major donor to Trump. And polls have suggested Kennedy could take critical votes away from Biden. CNN\u00a0was first to report\u00a0that Palma told a gathering of New York state Republicans that efforts to put Kennedy on the ballot in New York would help \u201cget rid of Biden,\u201d which she called her \u201cNo. 1 priority.\u201d \u201cThe only way that Trump can even, remote possibility of taking New York is if Bobby is on the ballot. If it\u2019s Trump vs. Biden, Biden wins. Biden wins six days, seven days a week. With Bobby in the mix, anything can happen,\u201d Palma said in a video of the meeting viewed by CNN. \u201cThe only way for him, for Bobby, to shake it up and to get rid of Biden is if he\u2019s on the ballot in every state, including New York,\u201d she continued. The Kennedy campaign has since distanced itself from Palma. Amaryllis Fox,\u00a0Kennedy\u2019s campaign director, said in a statement posted on X that Palma was hired by the campaign as a ballot-access consultant and that she doesn\u2019t shape electoral strategy, adding that Palma\u2019s remarks in a circulated video were made as a private citizen. Palma did not respond to a CNN request for comment\u00a0but on Tuesday afternoon posted to her Facebook page: \u201cWow- look at that news cycle. I guess the MSM doesn\u2019t like little ole me exercising my 1A rights? Hi, CNN!\u201d Tweets dating to November 2020 show Palma repeatedly volunteering to go to and attending numerous pro-Trump rallies and events \u2013\u00a0even tweeting at\u00a0\u201cStop the Steal\u201d organizer Ali Alexander she would go to Georgia for a week as the state was recounting votes. \u201cWe are rooting for you\u00a0@realDonaldTrump\u00a0Bigly. YUGE rooting. Biggest fan club EVER. #WeLoveYou\u00a0#BestPresidentEver45\u00a0\u00a0#FourMoreYears,\u201d she wrote on November 19, 2020. Palma also\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0expressed\u00a0an affinity for Powell, one of Trump\u2019s election lawyers who\u00a0promoted\u00a0unhinged conspiracy theories\u00a0about nationwide vote-rigging and who filed meritless lawsuits to overturn the results. \u201cYou were born/ chosen for this fight and you will win, win, win. WE LOVE YOU, TOO!\u201d she\u00a0tweeted at\u00a0Powell. In another\u00a0tweet on December 11, 2020,\u00a0Palma called Powell \u201cMY PERSON OF THE DECADE!!\u201d and posted a photo of the pair at the former Trump International Hotel in DC. Last year, Powell\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0in the Georgia election subversion case, in which Trump and a host of co-defendants are accused of orchestrating a broad conspiracy aimed at overturning Biden\u2019s 2020 electoral win in the state. It appears that Palma was in DC to attend the \u201cMillion MAGA March\u201d on December 12, 2020, as she\u00a0posted\u00a0photos on Twitter driving to the rally and posted on the day of the rally. \u201c#MAGAMillionMarch\u00a0 #MAGA #TrumpWon #BidenCheated #46DoesNotExist,\u201d\u00a0she wrote.

{"id": "2024_06_04_politics_fbi-bob-menendez-steakhouse-dinner", "text": "Steaks, cigars, booze, diplomats and pals \u2013 they were all on the menu at Sen. Bob Menendez\u2019s frequent dinners at Morton\u2019s The Steakhouse in Washington DC, according to two FBI investigators who testified Tuesday in the New Jersey Democrat\u2019s federal corruption trial. FBI investigative specialist Terry Williams Thompson, who eavesdropped on one of the meals on May 21, 2019, told the court she heard a woman ask another unidentified diner, \u201cWhat else can the love of my life do for you?\u201d While it wasn\u2019t immediately clear to whom the question was directed, the implication was clear: Nadine Menendez, the senator\u2019s wife, was the person asking. Throughout the trial, she has been heard over voicemail and seen in text messages addressing her husband with similar language. Bob and Nadine Menendez, along with New Jersey businessmen Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, are accused of engaging in a bribery scheme and acting as foreign agents for the Egyptian government. All four have pleaded not guilty. Nadine Menendez will be tried separately this summer. The trial in New York federal court is in its fourth week, and prosecutors have started to piece together different threads of the complex bribery scheme they\u2019ve alleged. The testimony about FBI surveillance adds another dimension to the prosecution\u2019s case, which also includes gold bars seized from the Menendez home, Nadine Menendez\u2019s text messages and other testimony. As he left court Tuesday, Bob Menendez told CNN in an interview that he feels confident his defense attorneys are \u201cshowing the truth\u201d by discrediting prosecution witnesses through cross-examination. A \u2018friendly\u2019 dinner Before the jury was seated Tuesday, Adam Fee, one of Bob Menendez\u2019s attorneys, argued that prosecutors were unfairly attempting to paint the May 2019 dinner as something malign \u2013 as co-conspirators plotting their crimes. According to Fee, the senator was a regular at the steakhouse, going there 250 nights out of the year. \u201cThere is nothing unusual about having dinner there with a diplomat or with a friend,\u201d Fee told Judge Sidney Stein. Prosecutors, in turn, argued that just because the senator had other dinners that were not conspiratorial or criminal in nature, doesn\u2019t mean that some didn\u2019t fit that bill. There were several FBI teams at Morton\u2019s that night who were looking out for other subjects at dinner with the senator. The government\u2019s first witness on Tuesday, Chase Hunter Mills, now an FBI special agent, testified that he saw two men and one woman, with blonde hair and wearing a tan fur overcoat, enter Morton\u2019s steakhouse on the night in question. \u201cThe proximity and the body language would lead me to believe they were friendly together,\u201d he said. Late Tuesday night, the US attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of New York released video and still pictures documenting the Morton\u2019s steakhouse dinner that were presented as evidence earlier in the day. The photos showed Bob and Nadine Menendez and alleged co-conspirator Hana seated at the table the FBI team was asked to observe. Thompson testified earlier that she was working with her partner, Damian Bradland, to surveil an individual from New York who would be in Washington that night. They developed a cover story as a married couple out on a dinner date. \u201cIt looked natural,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cBecause Morton\u2019s is a high-end restaurant, we made sure we dressed the part.\u201d Thompson told the court they found the senator and others dining in the restaurant\u2019s patio area, where there were only a few people being served. The investigators got themselves a table \u201ctwo arm\u2019s length away,\u201d she said, from the group they were observing. At the dinner table, Thompson observed the senator pour a bottle of wine, and there were also cigarettes and cigars, she testified. \u201cThey appeared to be getting along just fine,\u201d she said. \u201cBased on the laughter and what we heard, it made me think they were getting along.\u201d \u201cWe dined just like them,\u201d Thompson said. Bradland took photos of her with the subjects\u2019 table in the background, using their married couple cover to instead document their surveillance. They took no audio surveillance, however, and she jotted notes down to remember what they heard, although not a direct transcript, she testified. Asked by Fee if they observed anything that suggested the subjects of the surveillance were trying to avoid being photographed or observed, both Mills and Thompson said they did not.

{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_donald-trump-legal-bills-what-matters", "text": "The way American campaigns are financed can be impenetrable even to people who pay close attention to politics. Campaigns can only get so much money directly from donors. More money flows to organizations that can\u2019t technically coordinate with campaigns but sure seem to come close. Separate organizations can also try to influence elections by pushing for issues, but they sure seem to try to benefit candidates. Add into that complicated mess the fact that former President Donald Trump has been paying his copious legal bills through the campaign finance system. To better understand what we know about how and by whom campaigns are being funded in 2024, I went to Fredreka Schouten, who covers this complicated issue for CNN. Our conversation, conducted by email, is below. WOLF: What are the broad strokes of what we know about how Trump is financing his legal defense? SCHOUTEN: During the course of this campaign, the former president has asked his political donors to help pay his soaring legal bills. The primary vehicle has been a leadership PAC called Save America that Trump established after he lost the White House in November 2020. Trump seeded the PAC largely with money he raised in the aftermath of his loss when he asked for donors\u2019 help in fighting what he claimed was widespread fraud in the 2020 election. (Save America also transferred some of that money \u2013 $60 million \u2013 to the pro-Trump super PAC, MAGA Inc., that could directly spend money to help his campaign. More on that later.) As a presidential candidate in the 2024 election, Trump has consistently diverted a share of new political donations to Save America, and \u2013 by extension \u2013 to his legal expenses. For instance, a joint fundraising agreement among Trump, the Republican National Committee and a couple dozen state GOP committees\u00a0sends donations to Save America\u00a0before the national party and state committees get their cut, underscoring how much Trump prioritizes paying lawyers. Since the start of 2021, Save America has paid\u00a0nearly $80 million in legal bills\u00a0for Trump and others in his orbit. In April 2024 alone, as Trump\u2019s criminal hush money trial in New York got under way, the PAC racked up about $4.4 million in legal expenses between bills paid and outstanding debts, recent filings how. A big recipient: The law firm of Todd Blanche, the lead attorney representing Trump as he battled criminal charges in a Manhattan courtroom that centered on whether he falsified business records to conceal an election-eve payment to porn star Stormy Daniels in 2016. Trump was convicted on May 30 and has vowed to appeal. WOLF: Can he simply use campaign dollars for court bills? Does the law allow that? SCHOUTEN: Federal campaign finance law is riddled with all sorts of loopholes. Technically, candidates cannot use money donated to their campaigns for personal expenses \u2013 whether that\u2019s to pay a criminal defense lawyer in a personal matter or to buy groceries. But the agency that enforces federal election law treats leadership PACs such as Save America differently than candidates\u2019 main campaign accounts. Leadership PACs started off as committees created by current and former members of Congress to help boost their profiles and support other candidates. They cannot be used to directly support a presidential campaign. But over the years, they really have become slush funds \u2013 helping underwrite travel, polling, meals and other expenses politicians incur. Keep in mind that Trump\u2019s allies maintain that applying donors\u2019 money to legal expenses is a legitimate use because they characterize all his legal troubles \u2013 whether in civil or criminal cases \u2013 as part of an extensive \u201cpolitical witch hunt\u201d organized by his enemies to derail his campaign. WOLF: How has the drain of his legal problems affected Trump\u2019s campaign war chest? SCHOUTEN: Well, the bills grew so high that Save America has clawed back tens of millions of dollars from the super PAC, MAGA Inc., to help keep it afloat. So, as a practical matter, a super PAC focused on helping Trump get elected ended up diverting money to help pay legal bills during the early months of the presidential campaign. But one thing has become clear: Trump\u2019s team has used his legal difficulties as an engine to generate donations. We\u2019ve seen fundraising spikes during big court appearances but none so big as the nearly $53 million that Trump\u2019s political operation said it brought in in the 24 hours after the New York conviction last month. That single-day haul accounts for more than one-third of the whopping $141 million that the Trump campaign said it raised with the Republican National Committee in May. And MAGA Inc. just announced a May fundraising bonanza, saying it brought in nearly $70 million last month. WOLF: What are the important details we don\u2019t know about how Trump is financing his legal defense? SCHOUTEN: We really don\u2019t have the full picture of legal expenses from campaign finance reports. Senior advisers have told CNN that Trump is paying some of his legal expenses out of pocket, for instance.\u00a0And we don\u2019t know how much the Trump Organization, his real estate and branding company, might be underwriting. During the New York criminal trial, for example, Rhona Graff, the president\u2019s former longtime assistant at the Trump Organization, testified that the company was paying her legal bills. WOLF: A complaint has been filed against Trump for hiding payments to lawyers. What\u2019s that about, and what could come of it? SCHOUTEN: The Campaign Legal Center\u00a0watchdog group filed the complaint with federal election regulators against Trump\u2019s campaign and related committees, alleging they have concealed details on millions of dollars in legal payments by routing the money through a vendor. The complaint centers on more than $7 million paid by Trump-aligned committees to Red Curve Solutions, LLC as \u201creimbursements\u201d for legal expenses \u2013 although the company is not a law firm and largely provides services to help campaigns comply with federal election reporting requirements. Bradley Crate, the treasurer of Trump\u2019s campaign, oversees Red Curve. In its complaint with the Federal Election Commission, the Campaign Legal Center said the payments suggest that Red Curve \u201croutinely advanced money or paid for the cost of legal services provided by other vendors\u201d and was later reimbursed, which would violate disclosure requirements of federal campaign finance law. Neither Crate nor the Trump campaign have responded to CNN\u2019s inquiries about the complaint. Don\u2019t expect action from the FEC anytime soon. The commission \u2013 evenly divided along partisan lines \u2013 often deadlocks on enforcement decisions or takes action years after a complaint is first lodged. WOLF: What is Joe Biden\u2019s team doing differently to test the campaign finance rules this year? SCHOUTEN: I don\u2019t know that he\u2019s doing anything differently, but he\u2019s relying on tactics we\u2019ve seen most politicians use in the big-money era \u2013 even if they have decried the rise of so-called \u201cdark money\u201d groups that keep their donors\u2019 identities private. The main super PAC supporting Biden\u2019s bid, Future Forward, gets a big chunk of its funding from a nonprofit arm that doesn\u2019t disclose its donors to the public. Our CNN Investigates colleague Casey Tolan earlier this year pored over tax records to report about a couple with ties to artificial intelligence investments and cryptocurrency trading emerging as some of the biggest donors to Future Forward\u2019s dark-money arm. WOLF: Is most of the election spending coming this year from campaigns, super PACs or issue organizations? SCHOUTEN: So far this year, outside groups \u2013 including super PACs and issue organizations \u2013 are leading the spending in advertising in the presidential race, according to a tally of AdImpact data by our CNN colleague David Wright, who keeps close tabs on political ads. That\u2019s not surprising. Candidates face strict limits on the size and source of donations they receive, but super PACs and other outside groups can raise unlimited sums from a wide array of sources. If you include future reservations, the pro-Biden super PAC currently leads presidential spending with some $130 million in ads reserved for the fall. But there\u2019s no guarantee it won\u2019t be overtaken by Republican groups as the general election campaign heats up.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/politics/donald-trump-legal-bills-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Trump\u2019s New York concealed carry license was quietly suspended on April 1, 2023, following his indictment on criminal charges in New York, the official said. Two of the three pistols he was licensed to carry were turned over to the NYPD on March 31, 2023, and\u00a0a third gun listed on Trump\u2019s license \u201cwas lawfully moved to Florida,\u201d the person added. After Trump was convicted of 34 felonies on May 30, 2024,\u00a0he could be in violation of multiple state and federal laws\u00a0if he still possesses that third gun in Florida. CNN has reached out to representatives of Trump to determine whether he still has a gun in Florida. Possession of a firearm by a convicted felon is a federal crime. The\u00a0NYPD\u2019s Legal Bureau will complete its investigation \u201cthat will likely lead to revocation of his license,\u201d the senior police official said. Trump could seek a hearing challenging the revocation. Trump has had a license from the\u00a0NYPD\u00a0to carry a concealed firearm for more than a decade, according to multiple law enforcement sources, but because Trump\u2019s application came with a request for confidentiality, they are exempt from public records requests, according to the\u00a0NYPD\u2019s guidelines and New York state law. The suspension and pending revocation of his carry license suggests that he maintained his license the entire time of his presidency and after, until he was charged with multiple felonies for falsifying business records in March 2023. As a former president, Trump has full-time US Secret Service protection. This story has been updated with additional details.

It just doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d Baden has emerged as a central figure in the evolving story of two provocative flags seen at Alito\u2019s properties, an upside-down US flag hoisted at his home in Virginia in early 2021 and an \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag at his New Jersey home last summer. Alito has said the flag in Virginia was a response to a \u201cvery nasty neighborhood dispute,\u201d that apparently involved Baden. Alito has said that his wife, Martha-Ann Alito, hoisted the flag in response to an exchange with Baden in which she at one point used the term \u201cc*nt.\u201d But Baden said that exchange didn\u2019t happen until mid-February. The story came to light when the\u00a0New York Times published\u00a0a photo in May of the inverted American flag flying weeks earlier, on January 17, 2021. Records obtained by CNN show that Baden\u2019s then-boyfriend called police on February 15, 2021, to complain about Martha-Ann Alito, accusing her of \u201cunprompted\u201d harassment. The caller said they believed the confrontations were based on yard signs they had put up that were critical of former President\u00a0Donald Trump. Baden, who no longer lives in the neighborhood, described the exchange with the Alitos in sharp detail\u00a0Wednesday. She said that Justice Alito \u201cdidn\u2019t do anything\u201d as she exchanged words with his wife. \u201cHe just kept walking,\u201d Baden said. \u201cAnd basically disappeared.\u201d Baden said she regrets using the profanity\u00a0if it \u201cdistracts from that real message.\u201d One of the signs that Baden put on the lawn read, \u201cYou are complicit.\u201d Alito has claimed that some of the neighborhood signs were directed at his wife. Baden told CNN\u00a0on\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0that the sign was not directed at either of the Alitos. The New York Times subsequently published a photograph of the \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag at the\u00a0couple\u2019s\u00a0New Jersey property. The flag, which has a history dating to the Revolutionary War, has also become a symbol for Trump supporters. Both the \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag and inverted US flags were seen at the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. The incidents have drawn mounting criticism from Democratic and some Republican lawmakers. Several Democrats have called on Alito to recuse from cases involving the attack on the Capitol. In an unusual response late last month, Alito told lawmakers he had\u00a0nothing to do with the flags and that they were not intended to convey support for Trump or the Capitol attack. Explicitly declining to recuse, Alito said the decisions to hoist the flags were made by his wife. \u201cMy wife is fond of flying flags,\u201d Alito wrote. \u201cI am not.\u201d The Supreme Court is weighing major cases tied to the 2020 election and the attack on the US Capitol. In one, the justices are weighing Trump\u2019s claim of absolute immunity from special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election subversion charges. In another, a January 6 rioter is challenging an obstruction charge filed against him by prosecutors, arguing that Congress intended that law to apply to people destroying evidence, not storming a government building.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/politics/alito-former-neighbor-flags-cnntv/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_maga-inc-trump-election", "text": "One of Donald Trump\u2019s leading super PACs told donors it raised nearly $70 million in May and shared plans to spend $100 million this summer in key battleground states, according to a copy of a memo sent Tuesday and obtained by CNN. Taylor Budowich, the CEO of Make America Great Again, Inc., laid out the PAC\u2019s strategy to boost Trump in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada and Arizona \u2013 all states that the former president narrowly lost in 2020 and that remain competitive four years later. The document, sent to CNN by a source who received it, serves as a marker for how top Trump allies see his pathway to securing the 270 electoral votes needed to secure victory in November. The super PAC\u2019s haul \u2013 which cannot be independently confirmed until it files federal finance reports covering May \u2013 is in addition to the combined $141 million the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee said they raised last month, a massive influx of cash that coincided with the former president\u2019s New York hush money trial and conviction on 34 felony counts. The memo, which was first reported by The New York Times, argues that the Trump campaign and his allies remain well positioned in the ad wars despite President Joe Biden\u2019s and Democrats\u2019 longstanding financial advantage. Though it has spent far less in many top battlegrounds, MAGA Inc. said it has not had to burn through cash to keep Trump\u2019s voter coalition together \u2013 unlike Democrats, who have poured millions into ensuring Black and female voters remain engaged this cycle. \u201cTheir current buy is a sign of tremendous weakness and desperation,\u201d Burdowich wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s like if MAGA Inc. launched a massive ad campaign targeting Christian radio \u2026 in rural Georgia.\u201d The memo details how much of the $100 million that the super PAC plans to spend through Labor Day will be aimed at further siphoning Democratic votes away from Black and Hispanic communities, core demographics with whom Trump is faring better this cycle than in previous elections. It also describes how\u00a0MAGA Inc. intends to compete for voters in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada and Arizona \u2013 states viewed as critical to Trump\u2019s path to winning back White House. In Pennsylvania, where the super PAC has been on air for months hammering Biden\u2019s record and capacity to lead, it intends to remain active through November. The Keystone State has swung left in the years since 2016, when Trump became the first Republican presidential nominee to carry the state in almost three decades. Biden won it in 2020 and two years later, Democrats won races for governor and Senate over Trump-endorsed candidates by healthy margins. If signs start pointing toward Trump flipping Pennsylvania, it would intensify the fight over Wisconsin and Michigan \u2013 which are also part of Democrats\u2019 so-called blue wall of must-win states \u2013 giving the president\u2019s party a very narrow path to holding the White House. \u201cWinning Pennsylvania\u2019s 19 electoral points is the ball game,\u201d Burdowich said. In Georgia,\u00a0MAGA Inc. intends to place a \u201csignificant and sustained\u201d media buy through Labor Day. Budowich described the state\u2019s 16 electoral votes as presenting \u201cthe best gateway to the White House for President Trump \u2013 delivering the targeted 270 electoral votes.\u201d If the Peach State \u2013 which Biden surprisingly flipped in 2020 \u2013 remains competitive into the fall, that would suggest deeper trouble for Trump.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/politics/maga-inc-trump-election/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_joe-biden-heads-to-france", "text": "US President Joe Biden touched down in Paris\u00a0on\u00a0Wednesday for a trip marking the 80th\u00a0anniversary of D-Day and engaging in a state visit hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron. But the task at hand will be far loftier, as Biden seeks to deepen ties with transatlantic allies as Europe faces a re-energized Russia inside Ukraine, the looming threat of China and the risk posed by elections that could upset the current geopolitical order. Biden \u201creally believes we\u2019re at an inflection point in history,\u201d John Kirby, spokesman for the National Security Council, said. \u201cIt\u2019s tied to the way geopolitics are changing, the way challenges are being presented to us around the world.\u201d In Normandy, Biden and other Western leaders will recount one particular challenge facing allied forces on June 6, 1944 \u2013 the largest military invasion by sea in history \u2013 which counted more than 10,000 casualties and became a pivotal moment in the war\u00a0against Nazi Germany. This year\u2019s anniversary is likely the last major commemoration in which D-Day veterans, now nearing 100 years old, are on hand to bear witness. From Pointe-du-Hoc, which separates Omaha and Utah beaches where American troops landed, Biden will deliver a speech on the power of democracy\u00a0on Friday, leaning on the visceral imagery from that day to talk about the men who gave their lives in pursuit of democracy. \u201cMaking it clear what you stand for and what you stand against matters today,\u201d Kirby said, acknowledging the importance of Europe bolstering American leadership. Biden \u201crecognizes that, for as powerful as we are and as much good as we can do, we need help.\u201d The president arrived in France Wednesday morning and will head to Normandy on Thursday to partake in the ceremonies marking the D-Day anniversary. After the speech from Pointe-du-Hoc on Friday \u2013 a place famous in American military history for the heroic climb of Army Rangers up its 100-foot cliffs where they were able to neutralize German guns firing down on the beach \u2013 Biden is set to be f\u00eated with a state visit by French President Emmanuel Macron, returning the favor Biden offered the French leader in 2022. The solemn visit to Normandy and the subsequent state visit are now likely to be even more closely watched after the Wall Street Journal published a story that called into question the president\u2019s mental acuity behind closed doors. The story, which published just after Air Force One took off for France, again brought Biden\u2019s age to the forefront of the political conversation ahead of a grueling few weeks of travel that includes the trip to France, a return to Washington, the Group of 7 summit in Italy and a June 15 fundraiser in Los Angeles. The White House has slammed the Journal report. \u201cCongressional Republicans, foreign leaders and nonpartisan national-security experts have made clear in their own words that President Biden is a savvy and effective leader who has a deep record of legislative accomplishment,\u201d said White House spokesman Andrew Bates. \u201cNow, in 2024, House Republicans are making false claims as a political tactic that flatly contradict previous statements made by themselves and their colleagues.\u201d The Journal story was based on interviews with more than 45 people \u2013 both Democrat and Republican \u2013 and included administration officials who defended the president\u2019s performance. Most of those critical of Biden in the report were Republicans, the Journal said, though some Democrats acknowledged Biden showing signs of his age. The visit to France aims to bring Biden closer to one of his key allies on the world stage. Macron has been one of the key leaders in Europe\u2019s response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. France has doubled its defense budget, announced it would surpass NATO\u2019s 2% defense spending benchmark, and restarted domestic production of critical military inputs. In April, Macron visited a Eurenco factory that would make gunpowder after years of outsourcing the production. \u201cIt is today that the question of peace and war on our continent is being answered, as is our ability or inability to ensure our own security,\u201d Macron said in a recent speech. Biden is set to meet with Ukrainian President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky\u00a0while they are in Normandy and again on the sidelines of the G7 in Italy next week, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said. The visit comes at a critical time in Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, which has begun using Western weapons to strike targets inside Russia for the first time.\u00a0Ukraine had for months pleaded with Washington to allow it to strike targets on Russian soil with US weapons, as Moscow launched a brutal aerial and ground assault on Kharkiv, safe in the knowledge that its troops could retreat back to Russian soil to regroup and its weapons depots could not be targeted with Western arms. Biden quietly gave Ukraine permission to use those weapons; Macron was less subtle in his support for the measure. \u201cUkrainian soil is being attacked from bases in Russia. So how do we explain to the Ukrainians that we\u2019re going to have to protect these towns and basically everything we\u2019re seeing around Kharkiv at the moment, if we tell them you are not allowed to hit the point from which the missiles are fired?\u201d Marcon stated during a visit to Schloss Meseberg in Brandenburg, Germany last week. \u201cWe think that we should allow them to neutralize the military sites from which the missiles are fired and, basically, the military sites from which\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0is attacked,\u201d\u00a0Macron\u00a0continued. The French leader has been among the most vocal supporters of the Ukrainian cause in Europe, refusing to rule out sending French military trainers to Ukraine to assist Kyiv in its fight. But ultimately the United States is footing much of the bill for Ukraine\u2019s defense. The United States has sent $175 billion to Ukraine since Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion \u2013 eclipsing the $171 billion in today\u2019s dollars that the US sent to 16 European countries to rebuild after World War II. By contrast, European Union member states\u00a0together have sent\u00a0Ukraine $53 billion in direct financial assistance and $35 billion in military aid. The World Bank has estimated rebuilding Ukraine would cost more than $500 billion. And the war isn\u2019t over yet. Finding the funds to pay for that capacity could prove challenging. European Union countries consistently spend more than they make in tax revenue, and the governments borrow money to cover those costs. While the United States has higher overall deficits and debt levels, its economy and population are growing more quickly. Macron has nonetheless promised Zelensky continued support, promising more military aid last month \u201cin the coming days and weeks.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jessie Gretener, Mariya Knight and Joseph\u00a0Ataman\u00a0contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/politics/joe-biden-heads-to-france/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_politics_republicans-justice-system-what-matters", "text": "Last week, President Joe Biden was defending the justice system as a \u201ccornerstone\u201d of society. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous, it\u2019s irresponsible for anyone to say this was rigged just because they don\u2019t like the verdict,\u201d Biden said at the White House after Republicans tried to undercut the process that led to former President Donald Trump\u2019s conviction in New York on state charges. This week, the president will have to remember those words while his son Hunter faces federal gun charges at a trial in Delaware, the first of two separate cases this year that could lead to jail time. The Biden family must be frustrated that a plea deal fell apart last year when it was rejected by the Trump-appointed judge in the case, Maryellen Noreika. Plus, these particular gun charges are rarely prosecuted on their own, perhaps evidence of the enhanced scrutiny placed on a president\u2019s son. Very different trials Hunter Biden\u2019s gun trial is very different than Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial, even if they both come in an election year, feature the public airing of painful, personal details and essentially boil down to allegations of lying on paperwork. Trump had to endure the detailed, public testimony of Stormy Daniels, the adult-film actress who alleged an affair with Trump nearly 20 years ago. Hunter Biden will have to endure a public recounting of his affair with his brother Beau\u2019s widow, their tortured text messages and his drug addiction. But Trump\u2019s legal problems all revolve around his own campaigns and actions during and after his presidency. Trump was found guilty of falsifying business records to hide hush money payments meant to cover up the alleged affair from voters in 2016. He also faces federal charges of mishandling classified information in Florida and trying to overturn the 2020 election in Washington, DC, as well as Georgia. Hunter Biden faces trial in Delaware starting this week for lying on a firearm background check application. He checked the box that said \u201cno\u201d he was not abusing or addicted to drugs. He also faces trial in California later this year for tax evasion. David Weiss, the Trump-appointed special counsel prosecuting the case, has never made allegations to tie Hunter Biden\u2019s tax problems to his father, although Republicans on Capitol Hill have tried, unsuccessfully, to connect the dots. I\u2019ve written before about how the Department of Justice ends up prosecuting similar numbers of Democratic and Republican lawmakers. In New York this week, for instance, the bribery trial of New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez \u2013 his second distinct corruption trial in recent years \u2013 is underway. Trump may ultimately avoid federal prosecution. There is a very real possibility that Trump, while found guilty in a New York courtroom, will face neither set of the federal charges brought against him by special counsel Jack Smith before Election Day in November. The US Supreme Court has yet to weigh in on Trump\u2019s claim of absolute immunity, and the judge in his classified documents case has delayed proceedings indefinitely. The Georgia case is also delayed, and an appeals court may not consider whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis can stay on the case until October. A chorus of bias allegations But while Joe Biden\u2019s son and the senior senator from New Jersey are both in major legal peril, it is quickly becoming an article of faith among Republicans that they are a targeted species by the justice system. \u201cWhat people are seeing now is that they can\u2019t trust our judicial system,\u201d Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump told CNN\u2019s Kasie Hunt on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d The justice system \u201chunts Republicans while\u00a0protecting Democrats,\u201d said Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, reacting to the Trump guilty verdict. In a fundraising pitch on X, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida encouraged supporters angry about the \u201ctravesty\u201d to \u201cget even.\u201d Appearing on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas took the conspiracy theorizing much further, arguing that the Department of Justice is only prosecuting Menendez and, separately, Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas (who is also charged with bribery) because they have been critical of Biden on foreign relations and immigration policy \u2013 an allegation for which there is no evidence. Cotton predicted Biden would ultimately pardon his son. The White House has said there will be no pardon for Hunter Biden. Even Republicans who opposed Trump during the 2024 primary season are critical of Trump\u2019s New York conviction. New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu complained that Trump will face sentencing days before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. \u201cThat is a terrible idea,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to do nothing but rile everybody up. It\u2019s going to look even more political than it is now, and just cast a shadow of a doubt on this entire case.\u201d \u2018I may feel differently about it\u2019 The irony here is that Trump in 2020 actually did pressure the Department of Justice to investigate Hunter Biden. He also pushed Ukraine\u2019s government to open an investigation, hoping to tie Hunter Biden\u2019s work for a Ukrainian natural gas company to his father. In 2016, Trump\u2019s supporters would launch into \u201clock her up\u201d chants targeting Hillary Clinton \u2013 behavior Trump encouraged at the time even though the FBI, in the form of then-director James Comey, announced before the election that there was not a strong enough case to prosecute Clinton over her private email server. Trump said on Fox News over the weekend that if elected again, he might feel differently about pushing for charges against Clinton. \u201cThey all said \u2018lock her up.\u2019 But I felt \u2013 and I could have done it \u2013 but I thought it would have been a terrible thing. And then this happened to me. So I may feel differently about it,\u201d Trump said. Democrats promise to let the process play out against Hunter Biden Don\u2019t expect Democrats to show the same level of support for Hunter Biden that Republicans have shown for Trump. Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, promised Democrats would respect the process as it plays out against the president\u2019s son. \u201cDemocrats are not out there saying that Hunter Biden\u2019s trial is a farce, it\u2019s a fraud, it\u2019s rigged.

{"id": "2024_06_04_politics_takeaways-garlands-testimony-judiciary-committee", "text": "Attorney General Merrick Garland appeared defiant Tuesday as he spent hours fielding questions from lawmakers on a range of topics, occasionally sparring with Republican House members seeking to use his testimony to attack the Justice Department. Over the course of a roughly five-hour-long hearing before the House Judiciary Committee, Garland defended the department\u2019s work and role in several high-profile criminal cases, including those brought against former President Donald Trump and Hunter Biden. Garland\u2019s testimony comes as Republican lawmakers have argued that the Justice Department is being weaponized against\u00a0conservatives\u00a0and\u00a0just a few weeks after the GOP-led House Judiciary Committee and Oversight Committee voted to\u00a0advance contempt proceedings\u00a0against\u00a0the attorney general\u00a0for his refusal to turn over audio recordings of President Joe Biden\u2019s interview with\u00a0special counsel Robert Hur. \u201cI view contempt as a serious matter,\u201d Garland said at one point on Tuesday. \u201cBut I will not jeopardize the ability of our prosecutors and agents to do their jobs effectively in future investigations.\u201d Here are five takeaways from Tuesday\u2019s hearing: \u2018I will not be intimidated\u2019 Garland devoted a considerable part of his opening remarks to making clear that he was unmoved by the \u201cunprecedented\u201d attacks lobbed on his department in recent months. \u201cThese repeated attacks on the Justice Department are unprecedented, and they are unfounded,\u201d he told lawmakers. \u201cI will not be intimidated, and the Justice Department will not be intimidated. We will continue to do our jobs, free from political influence, and we will not back down from defending democracy.\u201d \u201cNothing will deter me from fulfilling my obligation to uphold the rule of law,\u201d he said. \u201cFulfilling that obligation includes ensuring that the Justice Department respects Congress\u2019 important role in our democracy.\u201d Garland said that while the department will not provide the audio recordings sought by the GOP lawmakers, it has \u201cgone to extraordinary lengths to ensure that the committee gets responses to its legitimate requests for information,\u201d including providing transcripts of the interview with Biden. The DOJ has argued that\u00a0the specific privacy concerns related to\u00a0an audio recording of an interview\u00a0are\u00a0distinct from those of a written transcript, and how the release of such an audio file could dissuade cooperation from future witnesses in criminal investigations. CNN has sued for access to\u00a0recordings of federal investigators\u2019 interview with Biden\u00a0in the now-closed probe over his handling of classified documents. Hush money case looms large Trump\u2019s conviction last week in the New York hush money case loomed large during Tuesday\u2019s hearing. Lawmakers repeatedly brought it up, and Garland emphasized that DOJ is \u201ccompletely independent\u201d from the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office. House Republicans have continued to claim without evidence that Biden has used his DOJ to target Trump, including through the New York case. \u201cThe Manhattan District Attorney has jurisdiction over cases involving New York state law, completely independent of the Justice Department, which has jurisdiction over cases involving federal law,\u201d Garland said. \u201cWe do not control the Manhattan District Attorney,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe Manhattan District Attorney does not report to us. The Manhattan District Attorney makes its own decisions about cases that he wants to bring under his state law.\u201d A New York jury convicted Trump last week on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment scheme he helped facilitate ahead of the 2016 presidential election. Defending Jack Smith\u2019s appointment During one particularly tense exchange on Tuesday,\u00a0Committee\u00a0Chairman Jim Jordan pressed Garland on his choice of Jack Smith to serve as special counsel in the Justice Department\u2019s probes into Trump. Those probes eventually led Smith to bring two criminal cases against the former president in Washington, DC, and Florida. \u201cI appointed somebody who is not a political appointee. Somebody who was independent, nonpartisan with a record of career experience as a prosecutor. That seemed to me the perfect resume,\u201d Garland said during the testy back and forth Jordan. \u201cDid he ask for the job?\u201d the Ohio Republican asked at one point. \u201cThis is not a job \u2013 I don\u2019t think anybody asks for,\u201d Garland replied with a laugh. Later, Jordan asked Garland if he regretted picking Smith. \u201cNo, I do not regret picking him,\u201d Garland shot back. The Hunter Biden split screen As the hearing unfolded on Capitol Hill, jurors in Hunter Biden\u2019s gun trial in Delaware heard opening statements in the case. Appearing to seize on the split screen moment, some lawmakers used their time to bring up the president\u2019s son and his legal woes. When GOP Rep. Ben Cline asked Garland if he spoke with the president\u2019s son when they were both in attendance at a state dinner at the White House in May, Garland said, \u201cI have never spoken to Hunter Biden in my life as far as I know.\u201d Garland also denied various accusations that Cline brought forward about DOJ\u2019s handling of the case into the president\u2019s son and maintained that he cannot discuss ongoing legal cases. When asked if he attempted to obstruct the criminal investigation into Hunter Biden, Garland said, \u201cabsolutely not.\u201d Democratic push back For their part, Democrats spent much of their time heaping praise on the Justice Department and defending its actions amid attacks on the DOJ from their Republican colleagues. As House Republicans repeatedly accused DOJ of improperly targeting allies of Trump, Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu listed off people around Trump who were prosecuted under the previous Republican administration. Those individuals included Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, former deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates, former campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, former lawyer Michael Cohen, former advisor Roger Stone, fundraiser Elliott Broidy \u2013 all of whom were prosecuted under attorneys general nominated by Trump himself. \u201cIt is not the fault of the Department of Justice that Donald Trump has surrounded himself with criminals,\u201d Lieu said. \u201cTrump brought that upon himself.\u201d Lieu also noted that President Biden\u2019s son Hunter is being prosecuted \u201cin federal court right now\u201d by Garland\u2019s Justice Department.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/politics/takeaways-garlands-testimony-judiciary-committee/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_trump-prosecute-political-opponents", "text": "Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday again suggested he would try to prosecute his political opponents if he\u2019s reelected as he railed against his criminal conviction in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible, terrible path that they\u2019re leading us to, and it\u2019s very possible that it\u2019s going to have to happen to them,\u201d Trump said in an interview with Newsmax. Trump faces the possibility of a prison sentence after he was convicted last week on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. But his suggestions of potentially going after political opponents by weaponizing the Justice Department began more than a year ago, when he was first indicted. He has said he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate President Joe Biden and his family if reelected and has argued several times he believes he is justified in doing so because Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to oversee criminal investigations that implicate Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s a very terrible thing. It\u2019s a terrible precedent for our country. Does that mean the next president does it to them? That\u2019s really the question,\u201d he told Newsmax. The former president still faces charges in three other criminal cases against him, and he has denied any wrongdoing. Trump, who has repeatedly called for the imprisonment of his 2016 Democratic presidential opponent Hillary Clinton despite her never being charged with a crime, also said Tuesday that he thought it would have been a \u201cterrible thing\u201d if Clinton went to jail. Trump recently falsely claimed in an interview with Fox News that he didn\u2019t call to lock up Clinton. \u201cI got a lot of credit from a lot of people, and some people said I should have done it, but, you know, could have, would have been very easy to do it, but I thought it would be a terrible precedent for our country,\u201d Trump said. Trump continued, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be terrible to throw the president\u2019s wife and the former secretary of state, think of it, the former secretary of state, but the president\u2019s wife, into jail. Wouldn\u2019t that be a terrible thing, but they want to do it.\u201d While Trump\u2019s advisers continue to downplay the idea of Trump being sentenced to prison in the wake of his conviction, the former president is telling allies he thinks he could be put behind bars. Trump\u2019s sentencing hearing has been set for July 11 after a Manhattan jury found him guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records last week. Prosecutors accused Trump of taking part in an illegal conspiracy to undermine the integrity of the 2016 presidential election and an unlawful plan to suppress negative information, which included concealing a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Trump\u2019s sentence is up to Judge Juan Merchan, and it could include prison time or probation. Trump has told multiple people in recent days that he believes it\u2019s a possibility that he could go to prison and that he\u2019s \u201cOK\u201d with it, according to two sources briefed on the conversations. His lawyers have indicated they believe they have a strong argument against prison given Trump\u2019s age, lack of a criminal record, and contributions to the community. \u201cWe are not planning for him to go to prison,\u201d one campaign adviser insisted to CNN. Earlier this week, Republican National Committee co-chair Michael Whatley said the party was preparing for a scenario in which Trump addressed the Republican National Convention from prison. The convention is slated to kick off on July 15 in Milwaukee, just four days after Trump\u2019s scheduled sentencing date. \u201cWe\u2019re working on that right now,\u201d Whatley told Newsmax. \u201cI\u2019m actually going up to Milwaukee this week and we\u2019re going to have a series of conversations. But look, we expect that Donald Trump is going to be in Milwaukee and he\u2019s going to be able to accept that nomination. And if not, we will make whatever contingency planning we need to make for it.\u201d Trump\u2019s allies were unhappy with the framing of Whatley\u2019s remarks, two sources told CNN. The former president\u2019s first campaign event since his conviction is expected to take place Thursday in Phoenix. He will be participating in a town hall hosted by the right-wing nonprofit Turning Point Action.

{"id": "2024_06_04_politics_biden-zelensky-meeting-normandy-g7", "text": "President Joe Biden will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky while he is in Normandy, France, according to White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan. \u201cWhile he\u2019s in Normandy, he\u2019ll have the opportunity to sit down with President Zelensky and have an engagement with him to talk about the state of play in Ukraine and how we can continue and deepen our support for Ukraine,\u201d Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One while en route to France. Biden and Zelensky will be in the French region to commemorate the 80th anniversary of D-Day, a moment made all the more timely given that Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has brought a large-scale ground war back to Europe for the first time since 1945. Also attending the anniversary will be living veterans of the historic seaborne invasion and many other heads of state and government \u2014 including British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. CNN previously reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin was not extended an invitation, according to a French presidential source. Sullivan added that Biden is also expected to meet with Zelensky during the G7 in Italy next week. \u201cIn the course of a little more than a week, the president will have two substantive engagements with President Zelensky,\u201d Sullivan said. The two leaders last met in person when Zelensky was in Washington, DC, in December 2023 to make an in-person plea for military and economic aid. Biden would eventually sign in April a bill providing over $60 billion in aid for the US ally after several months of political wrangling on Capitol Hill. The delay kept Ukraine\u2019s forces\u00a0significantly outgunned\u00a0against Russia, which launched a surprise offensive in the northeastern region of Kharkiv last month. Sullivan said the US plans to announce in coming weeks the delivery of additional \u201csubstantial capability to Ukraine,\u201d\u00a0but he made clear that the US will not send military personnel to the country, even in a training capacity, amid reports that France may send military instructors to Ukrainian territory. \u201cI will point out that the United States has stood up a substantial training infrastructure in Germany. It has trained thousands of Ukrainian soldiers on Western made equipment. We stand ready to continue and in fact, expand that training,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe have communicated that directly to the Ukrainians.\u201d Asked about US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen\u2019s work to rally European support to tap Russian overseas assets to help Ukraine, Sullivan said securing additional assistance for the war-torn country will be a \u201csubstantial agenda item\u201d in Biden\u2019s meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron while in Normandy. \u201cThis is a priority for the United States,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s a priority for the entire G7. We want to see every country come on board with a method by which we can mobilize resources for Ukraine at scale, so that they are able to have what they need to be able to succeed in this war.\u201d Sullivan also previewed Biden\u2019s expected speech later this week that will take place at Pointe du Hoc, where US Army Rangers scaled the 100 foot cliffs 80 years ago to destroy the German positions overlooking the beach. Biden in his remarks there will talk about how the battle was \u201can existential fight between dictatorship and freedom,\u201d how the men fighting that day \u201cput the country ahead of themselves\u201d and about \u201cthe dangers of isolationism,\u201d Sullivan told reporters. The national security adviser added that Biden will \u201cbe drawing a throughline from World War II through the Cold War and the stand up of the greatest military alliance the world has ever known, the NATO alliance, to today, where we face once again war in Europe, where NATO has rallied to defend freedom and sovereignty in Europe.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reporting.

{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_senate-vote-contraception-access", "text": "Senate Republicans voted Wednesday to block a bill put forward by Democrats that would guarantee access to contraception nationwide, as Democrats seek to highlight the issue in the run up to November\u2019s elections. The bill \u2013 the Right to Contraception Act \u2013 would enshrine into federal law a right for individuals to buy and use contraceptives, as well as for health care providers to provide them. It would apply to birth control pills, the plan B pill, condoms and other forms of contraception. The legislation failed to advance in a procedural vote by a tally of 51 to 39. Most Republicans dismissed the effort as a political messaging vote that is unnecessary and overly broad. GOP Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins crossed over to vote with Democrats in favor of advancing the bill. Schumer switched his vote to a no at the last minute in a procedural move that will allow Democrats to bring the bill back up in the future if they want. \u201cThis is a show vote. It\u2019s not serious,\u201d GOP Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said. \u201cPlus, it\u2019s a huge overreach. It doesn\u2019t make any exceptions for conscience. \u2026 It\u2019s a phony vote because contraception, to my knowledge, is not illegal. It\u2019s not unavailable.\u201d The vote is part of a larger push by Senate Democrats to draw attention to how the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade has affected all aspects of reproductive health \u2013 not just abortion \u2013 as the election draws closer. Democrats are highlighting the issue this month, which marks the two-year anniversary of the high court\u2019s ruling. \u201cIn the coming weeks, Senate Democrats will put reproductive freedoms front and center before this chamber, so that the American people can see for themselves who will stand up to defend their fundamental liberties,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said ahead of the vote. Democratic senators have also introduced a legislative package to establish a nationwide right to in-vitro fertilization, which is expected to come up for a vote as soon as next week. That follows an Alabama state Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that the destruction of embryos could be considered \u201cwrongful deaths.\u201d While the state\u2019s Legislature took action aimed at protecting IVF in the wake of the ruling, Democrats argue that this is only one example of how access to reproductive health care is under threat across the nation. \u201cIn the nearly two years since the Supreme Court threw out Roe v. Wade, our nation has seen the horrific consequences of Republicans\u2019 anti-science, anti-woman crusade that has put IVF at risk for millions of Americans who rely on it to start or grow their family,\u201d said\u00a0Illinois Democratic Sen.\u00a0Tammy\u00a0Duckworth, who\u00a0has\u00a0conceived through IVF. Republicans have introduced their own bills on IVF and contraception in an effort to prove\u00a0that\u00a0Democrats are\u00a0unfairly attempting to paint them as extreme.\u00a0GOP Sens. Katie Britt and Ted Cruz introduced\u00a0a bill called the IVF Protection Act in May, and Republican Sen. Joni Ernst has\u00a0put forward\u00a0a separate bill to promote access to contraception. \u201cWe will have an alternative that will make very clear that Republicans are for contraception,\u201d Senate GOP Whip John Thune said. Ahead of the vote on the Democrat-led bill, Ernst attempted to pass her alternative contraception bill by unanimous consent, but the request was blocked by Democrats. Asked how her effort is different from what Democrats want, Ernst said, \u201cIt does not include Plan B, which many folks on the right would consider abortive services.\u00a0Big distinction.\u00a0We want to prevent a pregnancy, not end a pregnancy.\u201d The emergency contraceptive pill sold as Plan B One-Step does not prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in the womb and does not cause an abortion, the US Food and Drug Administration has said. The pill, which is a strong dose of the birth control hormone levonorgestrel, prevents or delays the release of an egg from a woman\u2019s ovary \u2013 a step that occurs well before pregnancy. Democrats have argued that the GOP-led bills fall short, with\u00a0Democratic Sen. Patty\u00a0Murray arguing that Britt and Cruz\u2019s IVF legislation would not actually protect the procedure, noting that the bill does not address the destruction of embryos. \u201cUnlike GOP legislation that would not protect IVF and is only a PR tool for Republicans to hide their extremism, our\u00a0\ufeffRight to IVF Act\u00a0would actually protect Americans from attempts to restrict IVF and would allow more people to access these vital services at a lower cost,\u201d she said. Democrats on Tuesday focused on reproductive health care during a Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing titled \u201cThe Assault on Women\u2019s Freedoms.\u201d After the hearing, Murray told reporters that \u201cwomen\u2019s experiences are too personal for Republicans to spin, and the record of the Republican party is too clear for them to deny.\u201d The Democrat-led bill to guarantee access to contraception was introduced by Democratic Sens. Ed Markey, Mazie Hirono and Duckworth. CNN\u2019s Brenda Goodman contributed to the report. This story has been updated with additional information.

When asked about the status of the gag order, a court spokesman said, \u201cthe order is part of the court record that has been made publicly available and it speaks for itself.\u201d The Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office opposed Trump\u2019s request in a letter filed Tuesday, stating that the court still has an obligation to protect the integrity of the proceedings at least until Trump is sentenced next month. \u201cThese interests have not abated, and the Court has an obligation to protect the integrity of these proceedings and the fair administration of justice at least through the sentencing hearing and the resolution of any post-trial motions.

In March, just before the trial started\u00a0Merchan\u00a0granted prosecutors\u2019 request for a gag order that precluded Trump from making public statements about any witnesses in the case, jurors, prosecutors, court staff, or members of their family. Trump was not restricted from commenting on\u00a0Merchan\u00a0or Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. A representative for Bragg declined to comment. In imposing the gag order\u00a0Merchan\u00a0wrote, \u201cAlthough this Court did not issue an order restricting defendant\u2019s speech at the inception of this case, choosing instead to issue an admonition, given the nature and impact of the statements made against this Court and a family member thereof, the District Attorney and an assistant District Attorney, the witnesses in this case, as well as the nature and impact of the extrajudicial statements made by Defendant in the D.C. Circuit case (which resulted in the D.C Circuit issuing an order restricting his speech), and given that the eve of trial is upon us, it is without question that the imminency of the risk of harm is now paramount.\u201c Merchan\u00a0fined Trump $10,000 and found him in criminal contempt for violating the gag order 10 times early in the trial and raised the prospect that he might have to jail Trump if he continued to do so.

FBI staff operations specialist Marcus Allen had his security clearance suspended in 2022 when the FBI cited security concerns related to his \u201callegiance to the United States\u201d in a letter previously shared with Congress. Allen testified at a congressional hearing led by House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan\u00a0last year\u00a0after the bureau informed Congress it had revoked the security clearances of three agents who either attended the riot at the US Capitol or espoused alternate theories about the Capitol attack. When explaining its initial decision to revoke Allen\u2019s security clearance to Congress, the FBI wrote that its investigation showed Allen had \u201cquestionable judgment, unreliability, and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations,\u201d indicating that he could not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. The FBI listed a variety of reasons for suspending Allen in their letter, including a September 29, 2021, email in which Allen called on FBI officials to exercise \u201cextreme caution and discretion in pursuit of any investigative inquiries or leads pertaining to the events of\u201d January 6, according to a copy of the letter. Allen testified during last year\u2019s congressional hearing that he \u201cplayed no part in the events of Jan. 6,\u201d but alleged that he was retaliated against \u201cbecause I forwarded information to my superiors and others that questioned the official narrative of the events of Jan. 6.\u201d The bureau reinstated Allen\u2019s security clearance on May 31 after reaching a settlement agreement,\u00a0Allen\u2019s lawyer, Tristan Leavitt, told CNN.\u00a0 Allen then resigned from the bureau on Monday. \u201cThis is total vindication for Marcus,\u201d Leavitt, president of Empower Oversight, said in a statement. \u201cThe FBI has completely backed down and provided everything that we had asked for on behalf of Marcus.

Byron Donalds, a Republican who is seen as a potential running mate for Donald Trump, is defending himself amid Democratic criticism of comments he\u2019d made Tuesday suggesting that Black families were\u00a0\u201ctogether\u201d during the Jim Crow era of racial segregation. Donalds\u2019 comments,\u00a0which come as Trump\u2019s campaign seeks to make inroads with non-White voters,\u00a0were made at\u00a0an event in Philadelphia with\u00a0Texas Rep. Wesley Hunt, another Black Republican supporter of the former president. \u201cYou see, during Jim Crow, the Black family was together,\u201d Donalds said at the Tuesday event, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. \u201cDuring Jim Crow, more Black people were not just conservative \u2014 because Black people have always been conservative-minded \u2014 but more Black people voted conservatively,\u201d he said. That ended, he suggested, due to a culture of dependence promoted by the federal government\u2019s welfare system in the 1950s, including the establishment of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare \u2014 the federal agency now known as the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 and civil rights efforts that followed under President Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1960s. \u201cAnd then HEW, Lyndon Johnson \u2014 you go down that road, and now we are where we are,\u201d Donalds said. Those comments drew harsh rebukes Wednesday from President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign, which said on X, \u201cTrump VP contender Byron Donalds claims life was better for Black Americans during Jim Crow,\u201d as well as from other Democrats. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries took to the House floor at the conclusion of votes to call out Donalds. \u201cThat\u2019s an outlandish, outrageous and out-of-pocket observation,\u201d\u00a0the New York Democrat\u00a0said Wednesday. \u201cWe were not better off when a young boy named Emmett Till could be brutally murdered without consequence because of Jim Crow. We were not better off when Black women could be sexually assaulted without consequence because of Jim Crow.\u201d He added: \u201cHow dare you make such an ignorant observation? You better check yourself before you wreck yourself.\u201d Rep. Steven Horsford, the Nevada Democrat who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, said in a statement that Donalds\u2019 comments reflect \u201ca pattern of embracing racist ideologies that we see time and again within the MAGA Republican Party.\u201d \u201cRep. Donalds is playing his role as the mouthpiece who will say the quiet parts out loud that many will not say themselves,\u201d Horsford said. Donalds responded in a video posted on X Wednesday, saying that Biden\u2019s campaign and Jeffries should \u201ccheck your sources and stop lying to the American people.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re\u00a0trying to say that I said Black people were doing better under Jim Crow. I never said that. They are lying,\u201d Donalds said. \u201cWhat I said was is that you had more Black families under Jim Crow, and it was the Democrat polices under H.E.W., under the welfare state, that did help to destroy the Black family. That\u2019s what I said,\u201d he said. \u201cI also said that you\u2019re seeing a reinvigoration of Black families\u00a0today\u00a0in America, and that is a good thing.\u201d The controversy over Donalds\u2019 remarks comes as\u00a0polls show Trump making gains with Black and Hispanic voters compared to his performance in the 2020 election. Though Philadelphia, where Donalds\u2019 comments occurred, is overwhelmingly Democratic, Pennsylvania is poised to once again serve as one of the most important swing states in November\u2019s election.

North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance are among those who were sent the vetting materials, another source familiar with the process said. People familiar with the deliberations caution that Trump\u2019s search for a running mate is still in flux. According to multiple sources familiar with internal conversations, other candidates under consideration include South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and New York Rep. Elise Stefanik. Earlier Wednesday, Rubio said he hadn\u2019t talked to the Trump campaign about being vice president but added, \u201cI am sure once they make a decision, they will let everyone know.\u201d NBC News was first to report that the vetting materials had been sent out. Trump has floated a lengthy list of names in recent months and routinely asks allies, donors and members of his Mar-a-Lago resort for their opinion. He routinely praises many of these contenders publicly at his campaign rallies and in interviews. Many of the potential picks have spent recent weeks publicly demonstrating their loyalty to Trump, including appearing with him at court for his New York criminal hush money trial and defending him on television. Trump was ultimately found guilty of\u00a034 counts of falsifying business records. In an interview with Newsmax on Tuesday, Trump mentioned Scott, Burgum, Rubio, Vance and Ben Carson, his former\u00a0Housing and Urban Development secretary, when asked about his search for a potential running mate. \u201cWe have some unbelievable people,\u201d the former president said as he rattled off the names. \u201cBut I think I\u2019m going to hold it.\u201d Trump said in an interview with TMJ4 News last month there was a \u201cpretty good chance\u201d he would announce his running mate at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, which is slated to take place from July 15 to 18.

{"id": "2024_06_04_politics_biden-progressives-immigration", "text": "Joe Biden is pushing progressives who are already sour on his presidency to the limit with a tough new executive action barring most asylum applications from migrants crossing the US-Mexico border illegally. But the president\u2019s weakness on one of Donald Trump\u2019s biggest campaign issues means it\u2019s a risk that he has no option but to take. People familiar with Biden\u2019s strategy pointed out privately that he was in the position of taking bold action on immigration after Republicans in Congress refused to act after killing a bipartisan immigration bill to please their presumptive nominee. If Biden wins November\u2019s election, it will probably be because he was able to cement the most disaffected liberal Democrats behind him, while appealing to moderates and dissenting Republicans who reject Trump\u2019s extremism. Many of the latter group feel that the border crisis is a matter of urgent national security, and Biden needs to show he takes the presidential duty of securing the homeland seriously. But the president has been on dicey ground with his party\u2019s most liberal members for months, and his standing with progressives has weakened dangerously over his support for Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza after Hamas\u2019 October 7 terror attacks. The party schism will be on graphic display when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addresses Congress in the coming weeks \u2014 honoring an invitation that originated with Republicans keen to maximize Biden\u2019s political distress. The president\u2019s dilemma is so significant because of signs that the coalition that carried him to power over Trump four years ago has eroded. His support in polling compared to his performance four years ago has been especially shaky among liberal voters and people of color. In a knife-edge election that could come down to thousands of votes in a few states, every Democrat who doesn\u2019t show up for Biden is effectively a vote for his rival. The election may well turn on another Biden vulnerability \u2014 high prices and interest rates \u2014 or it could be decided by his warnings that Trump is unfit for office and a danger to democracy. But polls show voters are increasingly concerned about immigration. Of all issues tested, Biden recorded his lowest approval rating on immigration in a CNN poll in February \u2014 just 30%. Loud dissent from progressives on Biden\u2019s immigration moves The executive action, which is designed to alleviate the pressure on a hopelessly swamped asylum system, differs in important ways from the draconian policies of Trump \u2014 a point Biden was at pains to stress on Tuesday by emphasizing that he\u2019s not sending the military to lock people up before mass deportations, as the former president has said he plans to do. The Biden measure includes exceptions for unaccompanied minors and people who are deemed to be victims of a \u201csevere form\u201d of human trafficking. And the restrictions can be lifted if migrant arrivals fall well below current levels. But the act of wielding executive power to thwart any asylum applications strikes many progressives as a betrayal of liberal values, morally repugnant and counter to the country\u2019s historic mission. Biden addressed those Democrats directly on Tuesday at the White House. \u201cFor those who say the steps I\u2019ve taken are too strict, I say to you \u2026\u00a0 be patient \u2026 (the) good will of the American people \u2026 is wearing thin right now,\u201d he said. \u201cDoing nothing is not an option.\u00a0We have to act.\u201d Progressives are not just angry that the president\u2019s actions curtail asylum rights for desperate migrants fleeing repression, economic blight, trafficking, gang violence and other forms of political and social intimidation in South and Central America. The fear is that Biden\u2019s position will be the new orthodoxy for Democratic immigration initiatives going forward. These Democratic critics also despair that there\u2019s no path to citizenship for millions of migrants already in the country \u2014 including those brought to the US as children who are in limbo with no legal status. \u201cOnce again, no relief for Dreamers, farmworkers,\u201d Sen. Alex Padilla told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju.\u00a0Asked whether Biden could be hurt with progressive and Hispanic voters, the California Democrat replied: \u201cI guess there\u2019s still time for him to do what\u2019s right.\u201d Biden points out that he\u2019d rather act with Congress and that Republicans refused to pass the most conservative immigration bill in decades that would have paid for extra border patrol officers and poured resources into the stretched asylum system. But even that measure was stripped of many of the measures that Democrats traditionally seek to include in comprehensive immigration plans. Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chair Pramila Jayapal voiced a complaint shared by many liberals that Biden can\u2019t win votes by trying to match the Republican Party\u2019s march to the right. \u201cWe are making the same mistake again that Democrats continually make when we try to out-Republican the Republicans; it does not work,\u201d the Washington state Democrat said. Texas Rep. Greg Casar said Republicans \u201ctry to cover up their failures for this country by scapegoating immigrants and by trying to point to the border and to immigrants as the source of all of our problems,\u201d adding that it is \u201cunfortunate that President Biden is responding to those politics\u201d with this action. Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley added: \u201cWith all due respect Mr. President, we should not be unearthing policies from the last administration.\u201d Any president who disappoints his own supporters is in a perilous place when seeking reelection. Biden has shown throughout his term that he is conscious that the grassroots of his party is shifting left. He\u2019s granted billions of dollars in student loan relief \u2014 despite his efforts being thwarted by the courts and blasted by Republicans as illegal. He\u2019s tried to revive US manufacturing with hundreds of millions of dollars in public spending in his bipartisan infrastructure plan. And he\u2019s passed the most significant climate change legislation in America history, even if the measures fell short of what progressives had initially hoped for. Biden has also courted key figures on the progressive left, including Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, who ran against him in the 2020 Democratic primary. Progressives face their own dilemma Biden would never say it bluntly in public, but his gamble with progressives carries an implicit question \u2014 where else are they going to go? Will they instead vote for a Republican demagogue who borrowed Adolf Hitler\u2019s language while warning that immigrants are \u201cpoisoning the blood\u201d of the country? Will progressives and Arab Americans really stay home in the key swing state of Michigan and give an opening to a former president who called for a Muslim ban? This is a risky proposition for Biden, and some Democrats privately fear that the deaths of thousands of Palestinians in Israel\u2019s military operation in Gaza could be the kind of burning single moral issue that could depress significant votes in Michigan. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, who represents the battleground state\u2019s 12th Congressional District, got a lot of attention last month when she warned that there would be a price to pay for Biden and other Democrats who she said smeared pro-Palestinian protesters on college campuses. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to forget in November are we?\u201d Tlaib said. The congresswoman\u2019s remarks followed a campaign in the Michigan Democratic presidential primary that led more than 100,000 people to vote \u201cuncommitted\u201d because of Biden\u2019s support for Israel. The protests did not come with a commitment for voters to desert the president in November, and Trump, obviously, was not on the ballot. But anything like that loss of Democratic votes could spell big trouble for Biden in the general election. Still, Biden\u2019s comeback after a terrible start in the 2020 primary is a reminder that the loudest progressive voices do not necessarily represent the critical center of a party. Biden did especially well with moderate and Black voters, especially women, whose views may resonate as much as those of frequently quoted progressive leaders in Washington. And there are some scenarios in which being rebuked by voters like Tlaib may help Biden with the voters he most needs to beat Trump in November. \u201cBroadly speaking, for her to attack Joe Biden in this way probably helps him politically,\u201d Kate Bedingfield, a former Biden White House communications director, said on \u201cCNN This Morning\u201d last month. \u201cI think the majority of voters he\u2019s trying to win over, frankly the majority of voters in this country, are, broadly speaking, supportive of Israel, want to see us stand by our ally there. And I think if someone who is representing the farthest left of the party \u2026 if she\u2019s attacking Joe Biden, that probably helps him with the voters that he needs.\u201d One vital slice of the electorate the Biden campaign would love to impress are the Republican voters who chose former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley over Trump even months after she suspended her presidential primary campaign. Some Haley supporters on Tuesday welcomed Biden\u2019s immigration actions, CNN\u2019s Kit Maher reported. \u201cWhile many Haley voters continue to have policy differences, this common-sense action is a clear step in the right direction to address one of the top priorities of many Haley voters,\u201d the Haley Voters Working Group, a coalition of approximately 25 conservative Haley supporters, posted on X. The group is far too small to be representative. But expanding tiny seams of potential support is the critical work of grassroots campaigning in very tight elections. A Biden campaign official met with the group for a Zoom call last month. Amanda Stewart Sprowls, a Haley supporter from Arizona, told CNN Biden\u2019s actions on Tuesday were a \u201cshow of good faith\u201d and added: \u201cThey\u2019re starting to listen to the center.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/politics/biden-progressives-immigration/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_politics_biden-trump-weaknesses-analysis", "text": "Even after former President Donald Trump\u2019s conviction last week on 34 felony counts, he and President Joe Biden remain stuck in a strikingly similar strategic position: Neither man can win without attracting a significant sliver of voters who dislike them but may be even more alienated from their opponent. While the guilty verdict in Trump\u2019s hush money trial seems likely to further weaken his already tenuous standing with voters, by itself it\u2019s unlikely to strengthen Biden\u2019s own precarious position with the public. That means the election will likely pivot on whether more voters in the key states place greater weight on their doubts about Trump or on their concerns about Biden. \u201cGiven the unpopularity of both of these candidates, I think either candidate can win with a negative rating substantially higher than their positive rating,\u201d said longtime Republican pollster Whit Ayres. Polling shows that Biden and Trump alike are winning support from an unusually large number of voters who express reservations about them \u2014 largely because they consider the alternative even more unpalatable. Biden in polls, for instance, is winning a much greater share of voters who disapprove of his performance as president than any other incumbent seeking reelection in recent times. During their reelection bids, Barack Obama in 2012 and Donald Trump in 2020 each won only 3% of voters who said they disapproved of their job performance, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN. George W. Bush won only 6% of his disapprovers in his 2004 reelection, the exit polls found. But as for Biden, the latest Marist/NPR/PBS NewsHour poll released last week is typical: It found that 15% of voters who disapprove of his performance say they will vote for him anyway. That extends the pattern from the 2022 midterm election, when an unusually high 12% of voters who disapproved of Biden voted for Democratic House candidates, and even higher percentages of Biden disapprovers voted for Democrats in such key statewide races as the Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin gubernatorial contests, according to the exit polls. Voters who say they \u201cstrongly\u201d disapprove of Biden voted overwhelmingly for Republicans in 2022, and in the latest Marist survey, Trump drew over 9 in 10 of them. That\u2019s standard: Voters who strongly disapprove of a president\u2019s performance always vote overwhelmingly against him or his party. But House Democrats way overperformed in 2022 among the voters who said they \u201csomewhat\u201d disapproved of Biden. (They won 49% of them, far more than the roughly one-third House Republicans captured in 2018 from voters who somewhat disapproved of Trump.) And in the new Marist survey, Biden, stunningly, draws 55% of the vote against Trump from voters who somewhat disapprove of Biden\u2019s performance as president. (The latest national Marquette Law School poll, released in late May, also showed Biden drawing 53% of voters who somewhat disapproved of his performance.) By contrast, in their reelection campaigns, Trump and Obama both won fewer than 1 in 10 of the voters who somewhat disapproved of their performance, while Bush won fewer than 1 in 5 of them, the exit polls found. When people ask whether anything hurts Trump, Biden\u2019s showing among voters who somewhat disapprove of his performance points toward the answer. All the controversies swirling around Trump do hurt him, in a way that can be tangibly measured. In the new Marist poll, Biden\u2019s share of the vote against Trump in a two-way matchup is 10 points higher than Biden\u2019s own approval rating among men who identify as independents, 14 points higher among college-educated White women, 15 points higher among members of Generation Z and millennials, and 21 points higher among independent women. That\u2019s extraordinary for an incumbent president whose approval rating, for better or worse, is usually the north star of his reelection campaign. Those results represent millions of voters who are down on Biden\u2019s performance, frustrated by inflation and, in many instances, worried he\u2019s too old for the job, but who are planning to vote for him anyway because they consider Trump unfit or dangerous. Biden\u2019s problem is that while there is a large pool of voters willing to make that calculation, it is not an infinite one. Conflicted voters would be much more likely to push Biden over the top if he had a stronger foundation of Americans genuinely pleased with his record. Late last year, many Democrats hoped that steady improvement in inflation, interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve Board and a quick end to the fighting in Gaza might raise Biden\u2019s approval rating. But none of those events has occurred. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that events are lifting [Biden], and there\u2019s no evidence that the campaign is lifting him,\u201d said Bill Kristol, a longtime conservative strategist who has become a prominent Trump critic. The share of voters who view Biden\u2019s performance positively remains stuck at an ominously low level. Biden\u2019s approval rating is usually reaching only about 40% in most polls. That puts him just slightly higher than the Gallup approval ratings for Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush in the final months before their respective reelection defeats in 1980 and 1992 and slightly lower than Trump\u2019s in the final quarterly Gallup average before his defeat in 2020. The presidents reelected since World War II all had significantly higher Gallup approval ratings than Biden late in their first terms. So long as so few voters view Biden\u2019s performance positively, he will remain vulnerable to Trump, no matter how many doubts voters hold about the former president, many strategists in both parties agree. In fact, polls show Trump also benefiting from the lesser-of-two-evils dynamic boosting Biden. Presidential candidates typically win only minimal support from voters who view them unfavorably: Trump in 2020 and GOP nominee Mitt Romney in 2012, for instance, won just 5% of voters who expressed unfavorable opinions about them, the exit polls found. But last month\u2019s Marquette survey found that in the rematch with Biden, Trump is winning 17% of the voters who view him unfavorably; he was winning 12% in the Marist poll. That range puts Trump more in line with the unusually large share he won among voters who viewed him unfavorably during his successful 2016 race against Hillary Clinton. In results averaged over the two most recent national Marquette polls, a solid majority of voters agreed that Trump has behaved corruptly. But about one-third of those who described Trump as corrupt said they intend to vote for him anyway, according to unpublished results provided by poll director Charles Franklin. One reason for that: More than 90% of the voters who are voting for Trump even though they believe he has behaved corruptly also disapprove of Biden\u2019s performance as president. Each man\u2019s vulnerabilities, in other words, is blunting the impact of the other\u2019s. Ayres predicts the electoral consequence of Trump\u2019s conviction \u201cis going to be minimized\u201d because \u201cmost Americans don\u2019t think Joe Biden is able to serve effectively in a second term\u201d and are angry at him over the cost of living. But those acute Biden vulnerabilities, Ayres continued, are not dooming his campaign \u201cbecause he\u2019s running against a convicted felon\u201d who has alienated large swathes of the electorate on other grounds as well. Republican pollster Greg Strimple believes voters have already decided whose deficiencies concern them most: Biden. Recently, Strimple and a Democratic partner polled the seven most competitive swing states for The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter. The poll showed Trump leading in each state except Wisconsin, where the two men were tied. As important, Strimple said, was a series of questions in which the pollsters asked voters whether they were more concerned about a potential vulnerability of Trump\u2019s or Biden\u2019s. Each time, Strimple noted, a greater number said the potential Biden liability worried them most \u2014 with more, for instance, saying they worried about Biden\u2019s age and capacity than about Trump\u2019s temperament and legal problems. \u201cThe most fascinating thing about the survey was even if people believe something bad about Trump, they were still voting for him,\u201d Strimple said. \u201cThat is a strength of Trump\u2019s, but it\u2019s really the weakness of Biden that is propelling Trump.\u201d Strimple expressed more confidence about a Trump victory than any Republican outside his campaign whom I have spoken with this year. That\u2019s not because he thinks voters have especially opened to Trump since 2020, but because he believes they have closed the book on Biden, just as they did in the final months of the presidencies of Carter in 1980 and H.W. Bush in 1992. Biden \u201ccan\u2019t change inflation and he can\u2019t change the fact that he is really old,\u201d Strimple said. \u201cIf I am sitting there in the war room of campaign Biden, I am like, \u2018How can I fix two things that are unfixable?\u2019\u201d Longtime Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg sees the race in almost exactly the opposite terms. Rosenberg, who was the most prominent Democrat predicting that the widely anticipated red wave would fizzle in 2022, believes the vulnerabilities of Trump and his MAGA movement are so insurmountable that they eventually will overwhelm voters\u2019 doubts about Biden. Rosenberg leans heavily on the precedent of 2022. Though Republicans rolled to big victories in red-leaning states, he noted, Democrats vastly exceeded expectations by winning the gubernatorial races in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and the Senate races in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania. Those victories, he said, have created a template for Democrats to exploit the resistance to Trump\u2019s agenda in enough swing states to reach 270 Electoral College votes this year. \u201cWe know what happens when we go in with lots of money and a big campaign and talk about MAGA to swing-state voters: We win and they lose,\u201d he said. \u201cIf MAGA in 2024 is even more extreme and more dangerous \u2026 that is just the more likely scenario of what happens then the alternative.\u201d Rosenberg would prefer if more voters held positive views about Biden, but he insists it\u2019s not necessary for the president to win because the \u201cconstant dynamic\u201d in our politics since 2018 has become opposition to Trump and MAGA. \u201cWho the Democratic candidate is is to some degree immaterial,\u201d Rosenberg said. \u201cBecause this has been a pattern that has repeated again and again and again\u201d in the statewide races across the battlegrounds \u201cregardless of who the Democratic candidate has been.\u201d Michael Podhorzer, the former political director of the AFL-CIO, views the campaign, in effect, as a competition between these perspectives. He wrote last week that the level and nature of turnout will likely be shaped by whether the public debate in the race\u2019s final weeks focuses more on Biden\u2019s problems or Trump\u2019s. \u201cSince\u00a02016, whenever an election has been \u2018about\u2019 MAGA, turnout rates have been much higher than normal, and Democrats have won much more often in those contests,\u201d Podhorzer wrote. \u201cIf the Trump and MAGA agenda is salient in October, I am confident turnout will again be at historic highs and that Biden will do as well or better than he did in 2020. But if the economy, immigration, or a similar issue is center stage, turnout levels will be lower, as will Biden\u2019s prospects for an Electoral College victory.\u201d Podhorzer views Trump\u2019s conviction as necessary but not sufficient to shift the focus among swing voters from their discontents with the president back toward their hesitations about Trump. \u201cThe effect of the conviction shouldn\u2019t be exaggerated in a time where, by itself, no one thing can change the race,\u201d Podhorzer wrote in an email. \u201cBut it is very much characteristic of the kind of events that remind voters of how dangerous a second Trump term would be.\u201d On balance, history suggests there is more reason for concern among Democrats than Republicans in this pattern of offsetting weakness. In 1980, Carter successfully raised many doubts about his challenger, Ronald Reagan, just as H.W. Bush did about his challenger, Bill Clinton, in 1992. Yet neither Carter nor Bush could escape the gravitational pull of their own very low approval ratings and were soundly defeated. Voters who really dislike the status quo will almost always find ways to rationalize voting for change \u2014 no matter how risky that change appears. When people are deeply dissatisfied with conditions in the country, as I wrote during that 1992 campaign, stability seems to them the real risk. Still, Trump is a different kind of challenger from Reagan or Clinton. Because neither had held federal office, it was easier for both men to function as a relatively blank screen on which voters projected their hopes. By contrast, because Trump has been president already, voters have more fully formed opinions of what it would mean to return him to the Oval Office. So far in the 2024 race, that dynamic has largely advantaged Trump. His retrospective job approval in most surveys has been improving \u2014 often to a higher level than at any point during his presidency. That\u2019s largely because voters\u2019 discontent over inflation (and to a lesser extent border security) under Biden is causing them to weigh Trump\u2019s record on those issues more heavily when judging his overall record. A major danger to Trump from the conviction in New York, as Podhorzer suggests, may be that it begins a process of reminding voters about everything else they didn\u2019t like during Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 the chaos, division and unpredictability. Whatever the immediate effect of the verdict on the race, the prospect of electing a convicted felon as the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement officer and commander in chief may weigh more heavily on Americans as the election approaches. At a time when Trump is relying to an unusual degree on irregular voters who don\u2019t tend to follow current events, news of his conviction may come as a surprise and \u201cremind them of what he is really like,\u201d said Danielle Deiseroth, executive director of Data for Progress, a liberal polling firm that last week published a major survey of swing voters. \u201cI think there are going to be a lot of voters out there who voted in 2020 and don\u2019t like either candidate and stay home,\u201d she added. \u201cOr they might say, \u2018I\u2019d rather vote for the guy who is not a convicted felon.\u2019\u201d Voters\u2019 reservations about Trump and Biden help explain why the presidential race has seemed so static for months. The doubts each man faces place a ceiling on his support that limits his gains when the other stumbles \u2014 a pattern that seems more likely to be confirmed than confounded by Trump\u2019s unprecedented conviction. Against a stronger Democrat, Ayres believes, last week\u2019s guilty verdict would likely be fatal; but against a stronger Republican, he noted, so would the concerns about Biden\u2019s performance and age. The winner in this rematch between two weakened combatants will likely be the candidate who can focus more voters on his rival\u2019s vulnerabilities than his own.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/politics/biden-trump-weaknesses-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Hines continued: \u201cWe\u2019re here because of the defendant\u2019s lies and choices. \u2026 No one is above the law. It doesn\u2019t matter who you are or what your name is.\u201d Melissa Cohen Biden, Hunter Biden\u2019s wife, vigorously shook her head in disapproval when Hines argued that Biden knew he was an addict when he bought the gun. Defense attorney Abbe Lowell repeatedly highlighted during his opening statement that prosecutors needed \u201cto prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Hunter knowingly violated the law.\u201d Lowell emphasized that Biden\u2019s \u201cstate of mind\u201d when he purchased the gun was instrumental in the case. He also tried to humanize his client, saying that he abused alcohol and drugs \u201clike literally millions of people in this country\u201d and was plagued by various \u201ctraumas,\u201d including the 1972 car crash in Wilmington that killed his mother and gave him a brain injury when he was a child. At one point while Lowell was speaking, one juror appeared to become emotional, reaching for tissues in her bag and dabbed her eyes and her nose several times. Lowell, well into his statement, had explained how despite claims from prosecutors, the evidence doesn\u2019t show Biden was using drugs the day he bought the gun. Lowell was also discussing the tumultuous days when Hallie Biden found the gun and threw it in a trash can outside a supermarket. Here\u2019s what to know from Tuesday in court: Biden speaks \u2013 through his audiobook The first hour of witness testimony was consumed by prosecutors playing several long passages of the audiobook Biden narrated for his 2021 memoir, \u201cBeautiful Things.\u201d It droned on at times, but was also filled with gripping first-person storytelling about the depths of his addiction, spurring some jurors to listen closely and take notes. Many of those jurors said during the selection process Monday that they lost loved ones to drug overdoses and alcoholism, so Biden\u2019s personal struggles could strike a chord. In the excerpts played aloud in court Tuesday, chosen by the special counsel\u2019s office, Biden described intense \u201cfeelings of shame and guilt\u201d while crack plunged him into the \u201cdarkest recesses of your soul.\u201d He said he had a \u201climitless appetite for debasement\u201d that led to near-death experiences while he drove high in Arizona and bought drugs from homeless people in Los Angeles. Prosecutors highlighted a part of the book where Biden said he had \u201cfour years of active addiction\u201d from 2015 to 2019, which, importantly, would cover the time period when he bought a gun in October 2018. It\u2019s against the law for a drug user or addict to buy or possess a gun \u2013 which is the basis of the three felonies Biden is facing. First lady Jill Biden sat stoically while she listened to the recordings of her son airing out the worst moments of his life. She looked straight ahead at the FBI special agent on the witness stand, whom prosecutors used to introduce evidence from the memoir. Under cross-examination by Biden\u2019s lawyer, the FBI agent, Erika Jensen, conceded that Biden might not have been abusing drugs during the entire five-year period. Defense strategy Lowell laid out his version of the case and strategy moving forward in the morning opening statements and during cross-examination of the FBI agent in the afternoon. Not only did Lowell say that prosecutors must prove Biden knowingly violated the law when he bought the gun, but the attorney also argued that many of the text messages prosecutors had cited about the attempts to get drugs were months apart from when he purchased the firearm. During cross examination, Lowell noted that scores of the messages and pictures introduced to the jury through the FBI agent were in early 2019, months after Biden purchased the gun in October 2018. He also pointed out several discrepancies between Biden\u2019s memoir and text messages and travel logs presented by the FBI agent, indicating that not everything in the book \u2013 which is heavily cited by the government in its case \u2013 was completely factually accurate. Lowell said during his opening that text messages sent around the time Biden bought the weapon \u2013 including one where Biden said he was smoking crack \u2013 were actually about him trying to avoid Hallie Biden, who he was with at the time, and not doing drugs. In court, there were a few moments when Biden turned to his mom, his wife and his sister Ashley in the front row behind him. He mouthed words to his wife, who smiled. Jury sees lurid texts and photos Prosecutors also introduced a tranche of evidence that investigators obtained from Biden\u2019s electronics, including his infamous laptop. Their goal is to illustrate Biden abused drugs in 2018. They tried to accomplish this by playing a shirtless video of him holding what looked like a crack pipe, reading texts where he haphazardly tried to meet drug dealers in California and Massachusetts and showing his angry exchanges with his loved ones about his many personal failures. One exchange showed a drug dealer in Los Angeles trying to cut ties with Biden, complaining that he was going \u201cout of my way\u201d to get him drugs, at the cost of spending time with his own family. The dealer ended the text with, \u201cWe will always be friends, bro.\u201d In other messages, Biden said he was \u201csleeping on a car smoking crack\u201d at a street corner in downtown Wilmington that\u2019s only a few blocks away from the federal courthouse where the trial is under way. His defense attorneys claimed that he might not have really been doing drugs but rather was trying to avoid his ex-partner, Hallie Biden. Biden\u2019s laptop has been at the center of a yearslong political saga, with his team claiming it may have contained fake emails concocted by Russia, while many Republicans heralded it as ironclad proof that he and his father got rich from corrupt overseas deals. Prosecutors used the laptop much more narrowly, to try and prove that Biden used drugs in 2018. It was still a major moment when prosecutors unveiled the physical laptop for all in the courtroom to see. The silver MacBook has been bandied about in right-wing media for years, and the public saw it for the very first time on Tuesday. Biden\u2019s ex-wife likely to testify next Lowell will continue to cross-examine Jensen, who will then go through one last round of questions from prosecutors. During their opening arguments, prosecutors read the witnesses they expect to call during the trial in order, signaling that they would call Kathleen Buhle, Hunter Biden\u2019s ex-wife, to the stand second. In filings, prosecutors say that Biden\u2019s ex-wife will testify about finding drugs or paraphernalia on multiple occasions in his car.

{"id": "2024_06_04_politics_biden-slams-trump-convicted-felon-analysis", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to call out his predecessor Donald Trump as a \u201cconvicted felon\u201d for the first time represents a significant hardening of his rhetoric against his Republican general election foe. Biden\u2019s escalation at an off-camera fundraiser in Connecticut on Monday evening came as some Democrats pressed for a more robust political attack on the presumptive Republican nominee following his guilty verdict in his New York hush money trial last week. \u201cFor the first time in American history a former president that is a convicted felon is now seeking the office of the presidency,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut as disturbing as that is, more damaging is the all-out assault Donald Trump is making on the American system of justice.\u201d Other Democratic officials have used such rhetoric. But the phrase took on greater force coming from the mouth of the president himself. While Republicans have rallied around Trump since his conviction, it remains unclear how the verdict will go down in swing states where the shift in a few thousand votes could decide November\u2019s election. Biden\u2019s remark was yet another stunning turn in an election entangled in Trump\u2019s multiple legal threats. It came on a day when the first family was embroiled in its own extraordinary courtroom drama as Biden\u2019s son Hunter became the first child of a sitting president to go on trial. The younger Biden has pleaded not guilty to charges of buying and possessing a gun illegally while addicted to or abusing drugs. He also faces a tax trial in September. Last week, Biden noted that Trump had been convicted on 34 felony counts and said it was \u201creckless \u2026 dangerous \u2026 and irresponsible\u201d for his opponent to say the verdict was rigged. Presidential remarks in off-camera fundraisers can often serve as a test bed for rhetoric that later emerges in public events. But Biden\u2019s sharpened tone will certainly lead to accusations by the Trump campaign that the former president\u2019s conviction came after a process of political weaponization of the justice system. In another significant legal development Monday, Trump got good news from Georgia, where he is among multiple defendants in a racketeering case over his attempt to steal the swing state from Biden\u2019s column in the 2020 election. The Georgia Court of Appeals set oral arguments for October 4 over an effort to remove Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from the case. It was just the latest blow to prosecutors pursuing Trump over his election interference case. The timing of the arguments \u2014 only a month before Election Day \u2014 makes for an impossibly short timeframe for a trial. The Georgia case, in which Trump has pleaded not guilty, has been delayed by defendants\u2019 attempt to disqualify Willis after she employed a prosecutor with whom she was in a relationship. Other Trump cases are in suspended animation Two federal cases against Trump, in which he\u2019s also pleaded not guilty, are in a holding pattern. The US Supreme Court is expected to rule this month on Trump\u2019s sweeping demand for immunity for actions he undertook while president. The justices could still deliver a definitive ruling, but any decision that requires further litigation in lower courts could mean time runs out in special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election interference case with only five months to go before Election Day. At the same time, multiple disputes in pre-trial motions have put the looming federal trial in Florida over Trump\u2019s alleged mishandling of classified documents into suspended animation. Democrats have accused Trump-appointed Judge Aileen Cannon of showing political bias in her rulings. The logjam on multiple fronts means that it may prove impossible for the US legal system to account for the alleged attempt by a former president to stay in power against the will of voters before he has the chance to win another mandate. In itself, the delay represents a significant threat to American democracy\u2019s bid to save itself since it suggests that a future president who acted the same way Trump did might expect impunity. Trump\u2019s avoidance of accountability over 2020 election interference \u2014 through a mixture of skilled litigation by his lawyers, some backfiring decisions by prosecutors and luck \u2014 would also hugely raise the stakes of November\u2019s election. If Trump loses, his future after already losing one criminal case looks incredibly grim, with three cases that are likely to eventually get to trials that will entail massive legal fees. But if Trump wins, he could appoint an attorney general who could halt the federal cases in their tracks. And his Justice Department would be sure to make every effort to delay or defray any negative outcome he faces in the Georgia case as well as the New York hush money conviction that is due to proceed to sentencing on July 11. Given the personal stakes, it\u2019s reasonable to assume Trump will not stop at anything to regain power at a time when he\u2019s refusing to guarantee accepting the result of the 2024 election. Ty Cobb, a former Trump White House counsel, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on Monday that the date set in Georgia in October means there is \u201cno possibility of this case going to trial before the election.\u201d\u00a0And he added that the chances were rising that Trump could avoid any legal accountability for his actions in 2020 if he wins in 2024. \u201cIt\u2019s very real if he wins the election, it\u2019s not real at all if he loses,\u201d Cobb said. Referring to the federal election interference case and the classified documents matter, Cobb said, \u201cBoth of those will end up going at some point if Trump loses in early to mid next year and the Georgia case will likely follow that along.\u201d History made in Delaware The sluggish pace of Trump\u2019s criminal trials contrasts with the efficiency of those facing Hunter Biden, who\u2019s also due to face trial on tax charges in September. The cases of the former president and the current president\u2019s son are not analogous, and those surrounding Trump are hugely complicated. But they are sure to leave many Democrats marveling at the prospect that the only federal trial entangled with this year\u2019s election could be one that is targeting Hunter Biden and not Trump, whose actions after the 2020 election stretched US democracy to its limit. Joe Biden pledged on Monday not to comment on the outcome of a federal trial, but in a statement, he expressed boundless love for his son and his respect for his success in overcoming addiction to crack cocaine. \u201cI am the President, but I am also a dad,\u201d Biden said. Biden\u2019s cranked up rhetoric at the Monday fundraiser follows a warning by Trump in an interview with Fox News broadcast on Sunday of the consequences if Judge Juan Merchan imposed any jail term following the guilty verdict last week. \u201cI\u2019m not sure the public would stand for it,\u201d the former president said. \u201cI think it\u2019d be tough for the public to take. You know, at a certain point, there\u2019s a breaking point.\u201d Some senior Democrats accused Trump of inciting violence in his remarks, which took on a more ominous complexion given his past invocation to supporters to \u201cfight like hell\u201d before the mob attack by his supporters on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. \u201cThis is clearly Donald Trump once again inciting violence, potential violence, when he is sentenced,\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff told Kasie Hunt on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday.\u00a0 The California Democrat accused Trump of issuing \u201cyet another dangerous appeal to violence.\u201d The extraordinary tangling of the 2024 election and legal cases weighing on both Trump and Biden is likely to dominate a hearing on Capitol Hill on Tuesday when Attorney General Merrick Garland will brave a new grilling by Republicans. Garland vowed to restore trust in the legal system when he took office following the tumultuous Trump years by making sure everyone plays by the same rules. Three years on, he\u2019s frustrated much of Washington with a quest that looks quaint in an era when judges, prosecutors and juries in a proliferating wave of politically loaded cases are under almost constant attack. But hostility toward Garland has not come just from Republicans, who will be looking for vengeance on Tuesday following Trump\u2019s conviction. Democrats fret over the slow pace of the federal investigations. And the White House complained to Garland after special counsel Robert Hur\u2019s report on Joe Biden\u2019s handling of classified documents portrayed the president\u2019s memory as significantly degraded in a report that unleashed weeks of political reverberations, CNN reported. Garland is also likely to face scrutiny over the Hunter Biden trial. House Republicans have seized on the case to try to damage the president politically, especially after failing to provide any evidence that he profited from Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in their misfiring impeachment investigation. Republicans celebrated when a plea deal, which they saw as \u201csweetheart\u201d treatment for Hunter Biden, collapsed in court. But the Hunter Biden trial, as well as a federal corruption trial targeting New Jersey Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez, undercuts Republican claims of a biased justice system made in the wake of the Trump verdict in New York last week.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/politics/biden-slams-trump-convicted-felon-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_us-ambassador-to-nato-top-state-department-role", "text": "President Joe Biden has nominated\ufeff the current US ambassador to NATO to one of the top positions at the State Department. Biden announced on Wednesday his intent to nominate Julianne Smith to serve as the undersecretary of state for political affairs \u2013 a key diplomatic post involved in US efforts on Ukraine and the Middle East. Her nomination was sent to the Senate the same day, according to a release from the White House. The role has been without a confirmed official since late March, following the departure of Victoria Nuland. John Bass, the Under Secretary for Management, has been serving in the role in an acting capacity. Smith took on the role of US\u00a0ambassador\u00a0to NATO in November 2021, previously serving as a senior advisor to Secretary of State Antony Blinken. She has been the top US envoy to NATO throughout Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The war has put the defensive alliance to the test and prompted its expansion, with Finland and Sweden both joining NATO in response to Russia\u2019s invasion. A US official said that the administration hopes Smith will be confirmed to the job as soon as possible. It is unclear how quickly the Senate will move her nomination forward. A group of Republican senators have vowed to block all nominees in response to former President Donald Trump\u2019s guilty verdict in the New York hush money case.. \u201cWe would urge those who wish to see our ambassador nominees confirmed quickly to weigh in with those senators who have said they\u2019re going to block them,\u201d State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Wednesday. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which is responsible for the outset of the confirmation process, \u201cis strongly supportive and enthusiastic about the announcement of her nomination,\u201d said Eric Harris, the communications director for SFRC Democrats. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely looking forward to advancing her through the confirmation process ASAP.\u201d Smith will remain in the role of US\u00a0ambassador\u00a0to NATO while she awaits confirmation, meaning she will likely still have the role during next month\u2019s NATO summit in Washington, DC. Blinken said following an informal NATO meeting in Prague last week that the Washington Summit would celebrate the alliance\u2019s 75th anniversary but also \u201con the steps we\u2019re taking to ensure that the Alliance is fit for purpose for the next 75 years to meet the challenges of today and challenges we anticipate tomorrow.\u201d \u201cAt the summit, we\u2019ll be taking concrete steps to bring Ukraine closer to NATO and ensure that there\u2019s a bridge to membership, a bridge that\u2019s strong and well-lit,\u201d he said. \u201cNATO will help build Ukraine\u2019s future force, one that can effectively deter aggression and defend against it if necessary.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/politics/us-ambassador-to-nato-top-state-department-role/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_politics_fact-check-trump-post-conviction-speech", "text": "Former President Donald Trump said he was going to hold a \u201cpress conference\u201d on Friday in the wake of his Thursday conviction in Manhattan on felony charges of falsifying business records. Instead, Trump delivered a rambling monologue that was filled with false claims on subjects ranging from the Manhattan trial to immigration to tax policy. Here is a fact check of some of the inaccurate or unsubstantiated claims he made. Crime in New York City Trump repeated his familiar claim that, while Manhattan prosecutors have been focusing on him, New York City has been experiencing record-high violent crime. He said this time that \u201cyou have violent crime all over this city at levels that nobody\u2019s ever seen before.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim is not even close to true. Violent crime in New York City \u2013 and violent crime in Manhattan in particular \u2013 has plummeted since the early 1990s and is today nowhere near record levels. New York City recorded 391 murders in 2023, down about 83% from the 2,262 in 1990; 1,455 rapes in 2023, down about 53% from the 3,126 in 1990; and 16,910 robberies in 2023, down about 83% from the 100,280 in 1990. Michael Cohen\u2019s crimes Criticizing key prosecution witness Michael Cohen, Trump repeated a claim he made during the trial in April. He asserted that Cohen, his former lawyer and fixer, \u201cgot into trouble not because of me\u201d but because of \u201coutside deals\u201d and \u201csomething to do with taxicabs and medallions, and he borrowed money, and that\u2019s why he went.\u201d He added that Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations to try to get himself a lighter penalty. Trump continued: \u201cHe got in trouble for a very simple reason: because he was involved with borrowing a lot of money and he did something with the banks \u2013 I don\u2019t know, defrauded the banks, but something happened.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim that Cohen got into trouble simply because of his non-Trump-related activities, such as those related to taxis and loans, is not true. First, Cohen\u2019s case was referred to federal prosecutors in New York by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, who was appointed to investigate any connections between the Trump campaign and Russia. Second, Cohen\u2019s three-year prison sentence in 2018 was for\u00a0multiple\u00a0crimes, some of which were directly related to Trump.\u00a0 Most notably, Cohen was sentenced for\u00a0campaign finance offenses\u00a0connected to a hush money scheme\u00a0during the 2016 presidential campaign to conceal Trump\u2019s alleged extramarital relationships \u2013 the same hush money scheme that was central to this prosecution against Trump. Cohen was\u00a0also sentenced to two months in prison, to run concurrently with the three-year sentence, for\u00a0lying to Congress in 2017 in relation to previous talks about the possibility of building a Trump Tower in Moscow, Russia, including about the\u00a0extent of Trump\u2019s involvement in the aborted Moscow initiative\u00a0and about when in 2016 the discussions ended.\u00a0(The discussions continued into June 2016, the month after Trump\u00a0became the presumptive Republican nominee, and did not conclude in January 2016 before the first votes were cast, as Cohen had claimed.) Referring to Trump as \u201cIndividual-1,\u201d Cohen\u00a0said\u00a0at the time of his 2018 guilty plea for making false statements to the US\u00a0Senate Select Committee on Intelligence: \u201cI made these statements to be consistent with Individual-1\u2019s political messaging and out of loyalty to Individual-1.\u201d When Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to the campaign finance violations, he\u00a0said\u00a0he broke the law \u201cin coordination and at the direction of a candidate for federal office,\u201d\u00a0Trump. Biden and the case Trump repeated his frequent claim that the Manhattan case in which Trump was convicted \u201cis all done by Biden and his people\u201d and \u201cin total conjunction with white house and the DOJ,\u201d the federal Department of Justice. Facts First:\u00a0There is no basis for Trump\u2019s claim. There is no evidence that President Joe Biden, his White House aides or the federal Justice Department had any role in launching or running Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s prosecution\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and Bragg, a Democrat, is a locally elected official who does not report to the federal government. The\u00a0indictment\u00a0in the case was approved by a grand jury of ordinary citizens. Trump has\u00a0repeatedly invoked\u00a0a lawyer on Bragg\u2019s team, Matthew Colangelo, while making such claims; Colangelo left the Justice Department in 2022\u00a0to join the district attorney\u2019s office\u00a0as\u00a0senior counsel to Bragg. But there is no evidence that Biden had anything to do with Colangelo\u2019s employment decision. Colangelo and Bragg had been colleagues before Bragg was elected Manhattan district attorney in 2021. Before Colangelo worked at the Justice Department, he and Bragg worked at the same time in the office of New York\u2019s state attorney general, where Colangelo\u00a0investigated Trump\u2019s charity\u00a0and Trump\u2019s financial practices and was\u00a0involved in bringing various lawsuits\u00a0against the Trump administration. The judge and an expert in election law Trump claimed that, because of Judge Juan Merchan, \u201cwe weren\u2019t allowed to use our election expert under any circumstances.\u201d He claimed that this expert on election law was ready to testify \u201cand the judge knocked him out, said you can\u2019t testify.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim that Merchan refused to allow Trump\u2019s team to use this witness \u201cunder any circumstances\u201d is false. Merchan did not prohibit the potential witness, former\u00a0Federal Election Commission\u00a0chairman Bradley Smith, from testifying. Rather, Merchan\u00a0limited what Smith was allowed to testify about. Merchan\u00a0decided\u00a0in March that Smith could provide background information about the FEC and define certain terms relevant to this case but could not opine on whether Trump broke federal election laws or offer opinions about how to interpret or apply those laws. After Merchan\u00a0refused last week to change his mind, Trump\u2019s defense decided not to call Smith as a witness.\u00a0 Smith\u00a0wrote\u00a0on social media last week: \u201cJudge Merchan has so restricted my testimony that defense has decided not to call me.\u201d Trump, offering a hint of a clarification, did proceed to say on Friday that Smith \u201cessentially\u201d was not able to testify. But his earlier comments made it sound like Merchan had imposed a total ban on Smith\u2019s testimony. Immigration and \u2018the Congo\u2019 Trump repeated a claim he has made before about \u201cthe Congo\u201d and migration, again without specifying whether he was referring to the Democratic Republic of Congo or the neighboring Republic of Congo. He said: \u201cThe Congo has just released a lot of people from jail \u2013 Congo, Africa \u2013 just released a lot of people, a lot of people, from their prisons and jails, and brought them into the United States of America.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim is baseless. Experts on the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Republic of Congo, plus both pro-immigration and anti-immigration organizations in the US, told CNN they have not seen any evidence of Congolese prisons being emptied, let alone evidence of either country somehow having \u201cbrought\u201d ex-prisoners into the US. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and an allied super PAC did not respond to requests to provide any evidence. A CNN search of two media databases turned up no evidence. And federal figures show that there is no \u201cvery big\u201d influx of Congolese migrants of any kind, let alone former prisoners in particular. \u201cEverything he is saying isn\u2019t true,\u201d Democratic Republic of Congo spokesperson Patrick Muyaya Katembwe told CNN in a text message in March. Asked specifically about Trump\u2019s claims about Congolese prisons being emptied of violent criminals, he said, \u201cNever ever, it\u2019s not true.\u201d And, he said, \u201cwe want him to stop\u201d telling these stories, since \u201cit\u2019s very bad for the country.\u201d Serge Mombouli, the Republic of Congo\u2019s ambassador to the US, said in an email to CNN in March:\u00a0\u201cThere is no truth or any sign nor a single fact supporting such a claim or statement.\u201d You can read more\u00a0here. Trump and Nord Stream 2 Trump repeated his claim that he had ended a key Russian project \u2013 the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany. He said: \u201cYou know, I ended the Russian pipeline. It was dead.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim is false. He did not \u201cend\u201d Nord Stream nor render it \u201cdead.\u201d While he did\u00a0approve sanctions\u00a0on companies working on the project, that move came nearly three years into his presidency, when the pipeline was already\u00a0around 90% complete\u00a0\u2013 and the state-owned Russian gas company behind the project\u00a0said\u00a0shortly after the sanctions that it would complete the pipeline itself. The company\u00a0announced\u00a0in December 2020 that construction was resuming. And with days left in Trump\u2019s term in January 2021, Germany\u00a0announced\u00a0that it had renewed permission for construction in its waters. The pipeline never began operations; Germany ended up\u00a0halting the project\u00a0as Russia was about to invade Ukraine in early 2022. The pipeline was damaged later that year in what has been\u00a0described as a likely act of sabotage. Biden\u2019s tax policy Trump claimed while denouncing the Biden administration: \u201cThey want to raise your taxes by four times.\u201d Facts First: This is false, just as it was when Trump made the same claim during the 2020 election campaign and in early 2024. Biden has not proposed to quadruple Americans\u2019 taxes, and there has never been any indication that he is seeking to do so. The nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center think tank, which analyzed Biden\u2019s never-implemented budget proposals for fiscal 2024, found this: \u201cHis plan would raise average after-tax incomes for low-income households in 2024, leave them effectively unchanged for middle-income households, and lower after-tax incomes significantly for the highest-income taxpayers.\u201d The Tax Policy Center found that Biden\u2019s proposal would, on average, have raised taxes by about $2,300 \u2013 but that\u2019s about a 2.3% decline in after-tax income, not the massive reduction Trump is suggesting Biden wants. And critically, Tax Policy Center senior fellow Howard Gleckman noted to CNN on Friday that 95% of the tax hike would have been covered by the highest-income 5% of households. The very biggest burden under the Biden plan would have been carried by the very richest households; the Tax Policy Center found that households in the top 0.1% would have seen their after-tax incomes decline by more than 20%. That\u2019s \u201ca lot,\u201d Gleckman noted, but it\u2019s still nowhere near the quadrupling Trump claims Biden is looking for. And again, even this increase would have been only for a tiny subset of the population. Biden has promised not to raise taxes by even a cent for anyone making under $400,000 per year.

{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_house-gop-criminal-referrals-doj-hunter-james-biden", "text": "The Republican-led committees leading an impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden on Wednesday referred the president\u2019s son and brother to the Department of Justice, recommending they be charged with making false statements to Congress during their respective closed-door interviews earlier this year. The Republican committee chairmen laid out their case for why the DOJ should pursue criminal charges of Hunter and James Biden in a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland and special counsel David Weiss, who is leading separate criminal cases involving Hunter Biden. Through the criminal referrals, House Republicans are looking to go on offense, even if they don\u2019t move the needle in their stalled impeachment inquiry into the president. That investigation has failed to uncover evidence of wrongdoing by Biden and Republicans lack the votes in their narrow majority to impeach him. A referral, however, by no means obligates federal prosecutors to bring such a case and serves as a recommendation that the Justice Department investigate and look at charging the individuals in question. As such, the letter from House Oversight Chair James Comer, House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan and House Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith is largely symbolic at present. The Justice Department confirmed Wednesday that it had received the referrals, which cite two false statements the lawmakers say Hunter Biden made during his February 28 deposition and one false statement they say James Biden made during his February 21 interview with congressional investigators based on documents Republicans voted to release from IRS whistleblowers last month. The department declined additional comment. The Republicans are seeking to tie their criminal referral of Hunter Biden to his ongoing criminal trial on felony gun charges, arguing the criminal charge of lying on a gun purchase that he faces should weigh on how the DOJ evaluates their accusations. \u201cAccording to the Justice Manual, DOJ should consider Hunter Biden\u2019s prior alleged criminal activity when evaluating whether to charge him for the false statements described below,\u201d the letter states. Hunter Biden\u2019s attorney Abbe Lowell said in a statement Wednesday that the referral \u201cis nothing more than a desperate attempt by Republicans to twist Hunter\u2019s testimony so they can distract from their failed impeachment inquiry and interfere with his trial.\u201d CNN has reached out to representatives for James Biden. Republicans allege Hunter Biden \u201cfalsely distanced himself\u201d from his involvement with a corporate entity that received millions of dollars from foreign individuals, Rosemont Seneca Bohai. They also claim he testified an \u201centirely fictitious account\u201d about alleged text messages where he used his father as leverage to pressure a Chinese company into paying him. The president has emphatically denied\u00a0that he was involved or present\u00a0when his son sent the text messages. Hunter Biden also testified he was \u201cdrunk and probably high\u201d when he sent the messages, and his father was not sitting next to him. On James Biden, Republicans say his testimony that Joe Biden, as a private citizen, did not meet with Biden family business associate Tony Bobulinski, has been contradicted by Bobulinski and Hunter Biden. House Speaker Mike Johnson called on the DOJ to act immediately. \u201cIf the Attorney General wishes to demonstrate he is not running a two-tiered system of justice and targeting the President\u2019s political opponents, he will open criminal investigations into James and Hunter Biden,\u201d the Louisiana Republican said. In a statement accompanying the criminal referrals, Comer said, \u201cWe\u2019ve caught President Biden\u2019s son and brother making blatant lies to Congress in what appears to be a concerted effort to hide Joe Biden\u2019s involvement in his family\u2019s schemes.\u201d Jordan echoed: \u201cThese criminal referrals are a reflection of criminal wrongdoing by the Biden family, and the Department of Justice must take steps to hold the Bidens accountable.\u201d Smith, whose committee produced the documents that Republicans are using to allege the men made false statements, said that \u201cthe IRS whistleblowers have provided indisputable evidence that Hunter Biden broke the law and lied to Congress during his February deposition.\u201d Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, blasted the criminal referrals on Wednesday, saying they illustrate the \u201cspectacular failure and collapse\u201d of the Republican-led impeachment inquiry into the president. \u201cThe Chairmen\u2019s 60-page letter is a last-ditch effort to distract from the exoneration of President Biden by offering \u2018gotcha\u2019 accusations against the President\u2019s son and brother based on their efforts to recollect years-old financial transactions, text messages, and conversations in the course of this interminable fishing expedition,\u201d Raskin said.

{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_us-and-allies-warn-china-recruit-pilots", "text": "The US and its closest intelligence partners are warning that China has intensified a campaign to recruit former Western military pilots and other service members to train its own aviators, according to a joint bulletin released by the nations on Wednesday. Beijing has for years struggled with its air operations \u2014\u00a0including both pilot proficiency and its technical capabilities to counter western aviation tactics \u2014\u00a0even as it has built up its air and naval forces in preparation for a possible military takeover of the island of Taiwan. Western-trained pilots can teach Chinese military personnel everything from air combat tactics to how to land on an aircraft carrier, according to a US official. They can also give China a precious window into how it can counter western combat tactics. The warning was issued by the so-called Five Eyes nations, which share higher-level intelligence among them: the US, the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. \u201cTo overcome their shortcomings, China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army has been aggressively recruiting Western military talent to train their aviators,\u201d said Michael Casey, the director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, part of the US intelligence community. \u201cRecent actions by Western governments have impacted these operations, but PLA recruitment efforts continue to evolve in response.\u201d Asked about the bulletin on Wednesday, Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said the Pentagon \u201calways expect that our pilots will uphold the standards that they are trained under, and that they keep their training specific to the United States.\u201d \u201cI think there are national security risks there,\u201d she said. The bulletin, released by the Office of the Director for National Intelligence, warns that Beijing has used private companies that often hide their ties to the Chinese military to attract western pilots, contacting them via headhunters or professional networking sites and offering \u201clucrative contracts and the opportunity to fly exotic aircraft.\u201d Military pilots, flight engineers, and air operations center personnel, as well as \u201ctechnical experts with insight into Western military tactics,\u201d it said, have been \u201cthe most sought-after targets.\u201d These private companies have set up notionally independent operations in third countries like South Africa, Singapore and Laos, according to the US official. Former western pilots \u2014\u00a0which number at least in the dozens \u2014\u00a0are training Chinese military officials who then return to China and, in turn, train more pilots there, this person said. The US has sought to crack down on the tactic, in part by sanctioning some of the third-party companies.\u00a0But China has adapted, according to intelligence officials. \u201cThere have been efforts to incorporate entities in different locations under different names,\u201d said an NCSC official. \u201cThere have also been variations in recruitment pitches and approaches.\u201d Years of concern The bulletin caps years of growing concern by the US and its allies that the PLA was seeking to gain insight into western military tactics and technology by recruiting its former pilots. It also comes as tensions have continued to grow between China and Taiwan, just weeks after China launched large-scale military drills surrounding the island in what it said was punishment for \u201cseparatist acts\u201d after Taiwan elected a new president. Adm. John Aquilino, the former head of US Indo-Pacific Command, told Congress in March that combined, the PLA Navy and PLA Air Force \u201cconstitute the largest aviation force in the Indo-Pacific.\u201d In September, Gen. Charles Q. Brown \u2014 then the Air Force chief of staff and now the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff \u2014\u00a0warned in a letter\u00a0to the Air Force that foreign companies were \u201ctargeting and recruiting US and NATO-training military talent\u201d to assist the People\u2019s Liberation Army. \u201cBy essentially training the trainer, many of those who accept contracts with these foreign companies are eroding our national security, putting the very safety of their fellow servicemembers and the country at risk, and may be violating the law,\u201d Brown said. \u201cJust as I am asking for your help, I have also asked for help from our allied Air Chiefs to address the same issue within their ranks. In January of this year, US and NATO officials held a conference focused on countering Chinese recruitment of allied personnel to enhance their own air operations. The issue burst into the public consciousness in October of 2022, when former US Marine fighter jet pilot Daniel Duggan was arrested in Australia for allegedly training PLA pilots how to land on aircraft carriers. He has been held in a maximum-security prison in Australia since 2022, CNN has previously reported, after he worked in Beijing for six years. An indictment in 2017 alleged that Duggan trained Chinese pilots while he was still a US citizen, between November 2009 and November 2012. Duggan, now a naturalized Australian citizen, has denied the allegations that he broke US arms control laws. That same month, the UK Ministry of Defense issued a security alert after several of its military pilots were also found to have been training the PLA Air Force. The pilots had been contracted through a private South African company that offered high salaries. Canada and Australia announced investigations into the practice that same year. The US is seeking Duggan\u2019s extradition and is awaiting a final decision from the Australian Attorney General. The Arms Export Control Act, which bans weapons sales, also prohibits the training of foreign military personnel without explicit authorization. The bulletin on Wednesday also comes after multiple US service members have been arrested for allegedly leaking classified intelligence to China. In March, a US Army sergeant was charged with allegedly leaking classified information about advanced US weapons in exchange for $42,000. Last August, two US Navy sailors were arrested for allegedly sending sensitive military information to Chinese intelligence officers. Matt Olson, the Justice Department\u2019s assistant attorney general for national security, said in a press conference at the time that the charges against the two sailors \u201cdemonstrate the (People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s) determination to obtain information that is critical to our national defense by any means, so it can be used to their advantage.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/politics/us-and-allies-warn-china-recruit-pilots/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_rfk-jr-election-president", "text": "Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is perhaps the biggest X factor remaining in the presidential race. If the current polling matches the final result, Kennedy \u2013 a onetime Democrat who tends to be better liked by Republicans \u2013 would earn the second-highest vote share of any independent or third-party White House candidate in the past half-century. But can Kennedy defy the usual gravity of politics that drags down most non-major party hopefuls as the election approaches? There are already some signs that his support may have already peaked. Now, Kennedy, at this point, is still pulling a substantial portion of the vote. He scored 14% and 17% in May polls conducted by Quinnipiac University and Marquette University Law School respectively. That\u2019s better than any third-party or independent candidate has polled in an individual survey at this stage in the cycle since Ross Perot in 1996. It\u2019s that high level of support that has caused both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump to go after Kennedy. Trump is likely reading the polls that show Kennedy is slightly more likely to pull from voters who say they would be more inclined to vote for the former president. Biden is likely aware that Kennedy voters tend to skew younger \u2013 a demographic that traditionally leans Democratic. The attacks leveled on Kennedy seem like they may be having an effect. Take a look at polls conducted by Fox News, Quinnipiac and Reuters/Ipsos. All have trend lines dating back to late last year. In these three polls, Kennedy\u2019s support has dipped by an average of 5 points from their first survey to their most recent. Fox News has him going from 15% to 11%; Quinnipiac has him going from 17% to 14% (in a ballot test that includes Green Party candidate Jill Stein); Reuters/Ipsos shows him dropping from 17% to 10% among registered voters. This isn\u2019t to say you can\u2019t find a poll that has Kennedy doing slightly better than he was a few months ago (see Marquette). But the long-term trend line for Kennedy is not positive. Perhaps more concerning for the independent candidate is what\u2019s going on under the hood. His declining support isn\u2019t just a matter of voters now believing that backing anyone who isn\u2019t a Democrat or Republican would be a wasted vote. This is a matter of Kennedy himself becoming less liked. Take two polls that asked about Kennedy after he declared his independent candidacy in 2023 and then last month. His unfavorable rating in May\u2019s Quinnipiac poll jumped to 43% among voters, his highest on record. Kennedy\u2019s favorable rating dropped to 25%, just one point above his all-time low in the Quinnipiac poll. His net favorability was minus-18 points. He\u2019d previously never had a net negative favorable rating in the double digits. Kennedy, for almost the entire campaign, had considerably higher net favorability than either Biden or Trump. This was reversed in the latest Quinnipiac poll. Marquette\u2019s polling showed a somewhat similar trend. In November, Kennedy had a 38% favorable and 38% unfavorable rating. Today, he\u2019s at a 31% favorable and 45% unfavorable rating \u2013 his worst to date. (Marquette found Kennedy with a net favorable rating of +8 points during the primary season in February, when his unfavorable rating dipped to 32%.) Both Marquette and Quinnipiac continue to show that Kennedy is better liked by Republicans than Democrats. But even there, Kennedy has seen a clear decline in popularity. From April to May, Kennedy\u2019s favorable rating went from 44% among Republican voters to 31% in Quinnipiac\u2019s polling. His unfavorable rating climbed from 20% to 30%. The dip in Kennedy\u2019s popularity isn\u2019t the biggest surprise. The last time Trump faced off against an unpopular Democrat (Hillary Clinton in 2016), Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson looked like he could become the first independent or third-party candidate since Perot to take at least 5% of the presidential popular vote. Johnson ended up fading down the stretch, getting a little bit more than 3%. That was still the highest percentage for a non-major presidential candidate since Perot in 1996. This year, Kennedy is consistently polling higher than Johnson was in 2016. But Johnson had access to the Libertarian ballot line and was on the ballot in all 50 states. Kennedy, however, is currently nowhere near securing official ballot access in all 50 states. So all these national polls that indicate high levels of support for Kennedy aren\u2019t telling the full story if he won\u2019t be an option on many voters\u2019 ballots. Of course, this election isn\u2019t going to be won through the national popular vote. It will be won state-by-state through the Electoral College. How many ballots Kennedy gets on in the six closest states that Biden won in 2020 (Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) will ultimately be what determines his role in this election. Getting on the ballot isn\u2019t always easy for an independent, as Kennedy has learned in his ballot battle with Nevada. Still, this election is expected to be a close one, especially in the northern battleground states. Any share of the vote that Kennedy takes away from Biden or Trump could end up being crucial.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/politics/rfk-jr-election-president/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_politics_new-jersey-primary", "text": "New Jersey Rep. Rob\u00a0Menendez Jr. will survive his\u00a0Democratic primary challenge Tuesday, CNN projects, fending off Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla in the face of backlash to the congressman\u2019s scandal-tarred father, Sen. Bob Menendez. The senator is on trial in New York City on federal corruption and bribery charges. He has pleaded not guilty. Menendez Jr., who is running for a second term in New Jersey\u2019s 8th\u00a0Congressional District, sought to steer clear of his father\u2019s legal trouble and focus on his own\u00a0resume. That task became more difficult as the campaign dragged on and as the elder Menendez\u2019s trial began to make headlines. The senator\u2019s 11th-hour decision to file for reelection as an independent (he dropped out of the Democratic primary) also complicated his son\u2019s\u00a0path. But strong support from the hobbled-but-powerful party machine will likely have helped the congressman\u00a0overcome any Menendez fatigue in the North Jersey district. Bhalla\u2019s bid was hampered in part by his own ethics allegations. He is facing a lawsuit from a former Hoboken official and has been accused of trading a commercial cannabis license for a lucrative legal contract. (Bhalla\u2019s office has denied any wrongdoing and said the process went through all the appropriate channels.) Menendez Jr. highlighted those concerns in a flurry of direct mail and online ads. Kim will easily win Democratic Senate nod Rep. Andy Kim will win the Democratic nomination for Senate in New Jersey, CNN projects, setting him up as the favorite to succeed indicted\u00a0Sen. Bob Menendez in this deep-blue state. Kim, a three-term congressman from South Jersey, entered the race in September, the day after Menendez was indicted on bribery and corruption charges. He\u00a0quickly emerged as the favorite even with\u00a0New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy launching her campaign later that fall. But in the face of\u00a0mounting nepotism charges and a grassroots progressive\u00a0backlash, Murphy dropped out of the race in March. With Murphy\u2019s exit, Kim\u00a0appeared to be on a glide path to the Senate in a state that last elected a Republican to the chamber in 1972. Menendez, who is on trial in New York City, announced in March that he would not seek reelection in the Democratic primary. But on Monday, he filed to run as an independent \u2013 a move that could make the race more unpredictable, with control of the Senate hanging in the balance. Democrats hold a narrow majority in the chamber but face a difficult landscape this fall. Awaiting Kim in the general election will be\u00a0hotel developer Curtis Bashaw, who is projected to win Tuesday\u2019s Republican primary. A 41-year-old former diplomat and the son of Korean immigrants, Kim was the first Asian American elected to Congress from\u00a0New Jersey. His\u00a0anti-corruption message and the success of his high-profile legal challenge to New Jersey Democrats\u2019 unbalanced ballot design \u2013 which favored party machine-backed candidates \u2013 quickly made the congressman a hero to progressives. Longtime congressman defeats primary challenge over Gaza war Democratic\u00a0Rep. Bill Pascrell will fend off a primary challenge in New Jersey\u2019s 9th Congressional District, CNN projects, defeating Mohamed Khairullah, the mayor of Prospect Park, who was critical of the congressman\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Pascrell, 87, first entered Congress in 1997 and had\u00a0rarely been faced with a serious primary contest. A staunch supporter of Israel for decades, he had long\u00a0benefited from a place atop the ballot under New Jersey\u2019s arcane \u201ccounty line\u201d system \u2013 which was discarded this year\u00a0after a court battle. Khairullah, who is Muslim, made headlines last year after he was turned away from an Eid reception at the White House to mark the end of Ramadan. During the campaign, he charged Pascrell with turning his back on the district\u2019s Muslim community by failing to respond more forcefully to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. The district is home to a large population of Palestinian and Jewish voters, which has further elevated the issue. Pascrell in March called for a \u201cconditional ceasefire\u201d but held back in criticizing the Israeli government. \u201cThe scale of suffering in Gaza is ghastly and unacceptable, and my heart aches for those affected,\u201d Pascrell said\u00a0in a statement at the time. \u201cOnly with a ceasefire of hostilities can we provide the robust support and medical care necessary to address this crisis of historic proportion.\u201d Three months later, the\u00a0Israeli offensive continues, with humanitarian aid only trickling into the besieged enclave\u00a0as the civilian death toll rises.

{"id": "2024_06_04_politics_cannon-trump-special-counsel-hearing", "text": "Judge Aileen Cannon is again ripping up the court schedule in former President Donald Trump\u2019s classified documents case \u2013 pushing some of the legal questions that have been before her for months even further down the road. Cannon\u00a0is planning on holding a sprawling hearing on\u00a0Trump\u2019s request to declare Jack Smith\u2019s appointment as special counsel invalid,\u00a0signaling she could be more willing than any other trial judge to veto the special prosecutor\u2019s authority. The planned hearing also adds a new,\u00a0unusual twist in the federal criminal case against the former president:\u00a0Cannon on Tuesday said that a variety of political partisans and constitutional scholars not otherwise involved with the case can join in the oral arguments later this month. It\u2019s an extraordinary elevation of arguments in a criminal case \u2013 filed a year ago this week \u2013 that likely won\u2019t see trial until next year, if at all. Wednesday, Cannon went further, adding a hearing on a\u00a0gag order request from prosecutors\u00a0to limit Trump\u2019s rhetoric about law enforcement\u00a0and allotting more time to hear arguments on the special counsel issue. Cannon will hear arguments on those issues the week of June 21, as well as on the effort by Trump\u00a0to throw out evidence in his case\u00a0that was gathered by the FBI in its 2022 search of Mar-a-Lago or\u00a0provided by his former attorney\u00a0Evan Corcoran to a grand jury. At the same time, she delayed other hearings without setting a new date. The calendar shuffling is the latest example of Cannon\u2019s approach so far to the national security case: scheduling hours in court for arguments that other courts have mostly denied, and pushing off resolution of various legal matters\u00a0\u00a0for months. The delays are a significant legal win for Trump, who also scored a major victory in Georgia on Wednesday, where the state court of appeals put the election subversion conspiracy case there on hold indefinitely. Challenges to special counsel\u2019s office have failed nationwide Similar challenges from Trump and other high-level targets of special counsel probes have flopped from coast to coast in recent years: Hunter Biden\u2019s attorney didn\u2019t get anywhere with judges in Los Angeles and Delaware; Paul Manafort\u2019s\u00a0arguments fell flat\u00a0when the former Trump campaign chairman challenged special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s authority; and Andrew Miller, a former\u00a0associate of Roger Stone, also lost his challenge to Mueller\u2019s authority. Even with other federal trial-level judges allowing special counsels\u2019 criminal prosecutions, Cannon could\u00a0rule differently. Cannon\u2019s signal of willingness to entertain challenges to the special counsel comes in the same week Republicans are bearing down on Attorney General Merrick Garland for his use of special counsels. The issue, now before Cannon in the Southern District of Florida federal court, is likely to remain in the political debate at least until Cannon holds a hearing on the legal power of the special counsel to prosecute a defendant, on June 21. Cannon has already taken a drastically different tack from other trial-level federal judges who have handled criminal cases charged by recent special counsel\u2019s offices \u2013 of which there have been five since Trump became president. While others have moved swiftly to trial \u2013 including special counsel David Weiss trying his case against Hunter Biden in Delaware this week, eight months after indictment \u2013 Cannon has moved slowly on pre-trial issues from Trump and his two co-defendants. Many\u00a0of the most substantive legal questions to be decided in the classified records case, which the Justice Department first brought against Trump last June, aren\u2019t yet ripe for a decision. And it is highly unusual for a federal trial judge to allow a third-party group unaffiliated with a criminal case to argue in court as part of a defendant\u2019s legal challenges to the case itself. That work is essentially reserved for defendants\u2019 teams to bring and argue in courts across the country, opposite Justice Department prosecutors. Allowing third parties to argue in court is even rare in appeals situations. \u201cThe fact these motions are even being entertained with a hearing is itself ridiculous. That third parties are being allowed to opine\u00a0at the hearing is absurd,\u201d\u00a0Bradley Moss, a national security law expert based in Washington, DC, told CNN. But Cannon has been convinced by three separate groups of lawyers that they should be able to argue before her. Two of those groups support Trump\u2019s position to dismiss the case against him and say the special counsel, for various constitutional reasons, doesn\u2019t have authority to prosecute. A third group says the Department of Justice\u2019s use of a special counsel should be upheld. Two former Republican-appointed US attorneys general, Edwin Meese and Michael Mukasey, are part of the groups of so-called \u201cfriends of the court\u201d that side with Trump and\u00a0whom Cannon will hear from. The three groups will be allowed to argue, in addition to Justice Department and defendants\u2019 lawyers, for 30 minutes each, according to the court record. Meese and Mukasey have special insight to share with the judge, they say, given their former roles leading the Justice Department. Delayed Trump effort to question federal officials Meanwhile, Cannon on Wednesday delayed a previously scheduled multi-day proceeding where Trump\u2019s team\u00a0wanted\u00a0to question federal government officials under oath about how they conducted the investigation. Trump\u2019s legal team is angling to convince the judge to force the government to turn over\u00a0more records from far-flung offices\u00a0of the executive branch. The special counsel\u2019s office argued to Cannon in person months ago that making federal government officials witnesses at this stage of the case \u2013 as Trump wants \u2013 would be an unprecedented exploitation of the court. Cannon still agreed to the hearing Trump wanted.\u00a0But that hearing is no longer on the schedule.

{"id": "2024_04_10_politics_lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims", "text": "The Republican National Committee last week sent out a scripted call to voters\u2019 phones on behalf of new co-chair Lara Trump saying Democrats committed \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election. It\u2019s the latest example of how the RNC under the former president\u2019s daughter-in-law is perpetuating lies about the 2020 election, even as prominent Republicans say the party needs to look forward to win in 2024. \u201cWe all know the problems. No photo IDs, unsecured ballot drop boxes, mass mailing of ballots, and voter rolls chock full of deceased people and non-citizens are just a few examples of the massive fraud that took place,\u201d the RNC call said. \u201cIf Democrats have their way, your vote could be canceled out by someone who isn\u2019t even an American citizen.\u201d The claim of \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election marks a significant shift in messaging for the RNC because lies about the 2020 election had not been a consistent theme in its messaging since Donald Trump left office. But the call\u2019s message is largely consistent with the views publicly espoused over the past four years by Lara Trump, who was elected as co-chair in early March as part of Donald Trump\u2019s takeover of the GOP. Lara Trump has a long history of echoing his election fraud claims, according to a CNN KFile analysis of her past statements as a commentator and surrogate for the former president. \u201cI\u2019m sure you agree with co-chair Trump that we cannot allow the chaos and questions of the 2020 election to ever happen again,\u201d said the call, which was obtained by CNN\u2019s KFile from the anti-robocall application Nomorobo, which estimated 145,000 calls were sent with the message from April 1-7. It comes amid previous CNN reporting about the RNC asking employees who are reapplying for their jobs whether they believe the 2020 election was stolen in an apparent litmus test for hiring. The RNC denied any such litmus test existed.\u00a0Lara Trump and new chair Michael Whatley succeeded Drew McKissick and Ronna McDaniel, who had earned the ire of the former president because of his dissatisfaction with how the RNC handled claims of fraud around the 2020 election, CNN previously reported. There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, as even some state GOP election officials and former Trump Attorney General William Barr have acknowledged. The former president and his supporters filed more than 60 court cases in six key battleground states following the election and lost every one of them. And, they have still not brought forth any evidence of the rampant cheating they continue to talk about on the campaign trail. But in the years since the 2020 election, Lara Trump has continued to push claims of fraud. Her comments have been in line with those of her father-in-law, who\u2019s successfully reshaped the GOP in his image and easily secured his third-straight GOP nomination this year. Polling, for example, shows that a majority of GOP voters think the 2020 election result was illegitimate. A CNN poll released last September found that 71% of Republicans said President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cdid not legitimately win enough votes to win the presidency.\u201d From November 2020 to February 2024, Lara Trump propagated the narrative of Democratic cheating in the 2020 presidential election. And even after she was elected co-chair and said claims of a stolen election are \u201cin the past,\u201d she didn\u2019t repudiate those baseless accusations. \u201cWell, I think we\u2019re past that. I think that\u2019s in the past. We learned a lot. Certainly, we took a lot of notes,\u201d Trump said in an NBC interview when asked whether claims of a stolen 2020 election would be the official position of the RNC in 2024. She went on to tout lawsuits across 23 states \u201cto ensure that it is harder to cheat and easier to vote,\u201d while raising questions about pandemic-era voting procedures during the 2020 election. In the same interview, Trump also added the GOP needed to \u201ctrust mail-in voting.\u201d Neither the RNC nor Lara Trump responded to multiple requests for comment. A long history of spreading election lies As recently as February 2024, Lara Trump said she did not believe Biden received 81 million votes in the 2020 election. \u201cDoes anyone actually believe that in 2020, 81 million people were so inspired by a guy who could only get 10 people (to attended events) \u2026that he had the most massive turnout in the history of elections?\u201d she said at a Trump event in South Carolina just days before she announced her campaign for RNC co-chair. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t believe that.\u201d On her internet show and podcast, and in public events, she often spread outlandish and nonsensical claims about the 2020 election. On an episode of her show that aired on December 30, 2020, Trump agreed with her co-hosts that the election did not pass the \u201csmell test\u201d and falsely suggested that dead voters helped Biden win. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know if this is true, but somebody sent me this. Donald Trump got 74 million votes. There are 133 million registered voters in the United States. If every single registered voter went out and voted, which we know is basically impossible, doesn\u2019t happen, there would only be 59 million votes left for Joe Biden. So how the heck did he get 81 million votes?\u201d she said. The comments cite a widely debunked analysis that misrepresents the number of people eligible to vote. \u201cYou\u2019re discriminating against all the dead people, Lara. How dare you!\u201d said one co-host. \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s true,\u201d she responded. A CNN analysis previously found no evidence to support this claim, debunking the misinformation spread by Trump supporters online in the aftermath of the 2020 results. The 2020 election saw a record-breaking turnout, with 155 million people casting their votes, as reported by the US Census Bureau. This marked the highest voter participation of the 21st century, with 66.8% of eligible citizens aged 18 and older voting. Later in the episode, Trump said, \u201cI think that [Democrats] know that the Republicans are not gonna let it stand. They\u2019re not gonna certify votes for Joe Biden. And it is likely that they will be voting for Donald Trump for a second term.\u201d In an episode of her podcast weeks earlier, she claimed the odds of Biden winning in swing states were \u201cone in one quadrillion to the fourth power,\u201d as mail-in ballots were counted, failing to cite a statistical analysis. Though Biden narrowly lost with in-person voters, 46% of voters voted by mail in 2020. As votes were counted, Biden pulled ahead, according to an analysis from Pew Research. Though nothing was abnormal or illegal about the process, Lara Trump has also referred to the counting of votes nefariously. \u201cWe gotta make up so much for all the cheating,\u201d Trump said on her podcast in September 2023. \u201cWe know the Democrats love to do that. We need to go into this thing with such a big lead that they\u2019re like, \u2018oh my God, we can\u2019t do a 3:00 a.m. spike with this. We\u2019re never gonna make it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/politics/lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_politics_border-biden-trump-what-matters", "text": "President Joe Biden is pulling from former President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration playbook as he tries to stop a flow of asylum-seekers from around the world who are crossing into the US at the border with Mexico. Unveiled at the White House on Tuesday, Biden\u2019s new plan to all but shut down the US border to asylum-seekers who cross the border illegally uses executive authority Trump once used to bar people from mostly-Muslim countries from entering the US in 2017 and also to bar most asylum-seekers in 2018 \u2013 days after Republicans suffered huge setbacks in midterm elections that year. It\u2019s an odd, election-year twist, since Biden actually ran his 2020 campaign in part on a promise to revoke those actions, which he did in the months after taking office. Trump\u2019s asylum policy was also blocked by federal courts before Biden revoked it. In addition to slowing the flow of asylum-seekers, Biden\u2019s action could have the political effect of chipping away at Trump\u2019s lead on the immigration issue and triangulating some middle-ground support, even if it leaves progressives angry. Read the full story on Biden\u2019s announcement from CNN\u2019s White House team. Trump and Biden remain very far apart It\u2019s still very true that their rhetoric on immigrants remains very different. Biden expresses openness to immigrants as an important segment of American society. He wants to protect the children of undocumented immigrants who have grown up in the US and to create a pathway to citizenship for those already here. Trump routinely employs over-the-top rhetoric to demonize migrants and asylum-seekers as being from a criminal class or part of a coordinated invasion of the US, although there\u2019s no evidence to support those claims. Trump has promised a militaristic approach to the border and a massive deportation program if he\u2019s elected in November. Biden, meanwhile, has been pivoting to the middle on immigration all year. The decision to invoke executive authority comes months after a bipartisan border proposal in Congress failed to yield a new permanent law to reform the asylum process. Republican lawmakers, bowing to Trump, refused to work with the White House. Trump had said he wanted to run on the issue of immigration in this election year. Announcing the new action at the White House, Biden said he was trying \u201cto do what the Republicans in Congress refused to do.\u201d Even if he\u2019s adopting the authority behind Trump\u2019s policy, he promised not to adopt Trump\u2019s rhetoric. \u201cI\u2019ll never refer to immigrants as poisoning the blood of a country,\u201d Biden said at the White House. Biden argued that exceptions in his action make it more humane than Trump\u2019s proposals. Asylum-seekers can still try to make an appointment with border officials and seek asylum at a port of entry. Expect challenges The American Civil Liberties Union, which challenged Trump\u2019s border actions when he was president, now plans to challenge Biden. \u201cIt was illegal when Trump did it, and it is no less illegal now,\u201d Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, said in a statement. But today\u2019s Supreme Court, which has a majority of conservative appointees, could be more friendly to Biden\u2019s action. Border crossings are actually down CNN\u2019s Rosa Flores reported from Hidalgo, Texas, on Tuesday and noted the decline in crossings. Whereas last December, there were around 250,000 border apprehensions, figures in recent months are less than 140,000, and Flores reported the figures dropped even further in May. The Biden plan would bar migrants who cross the border illegally from seeking asylum once a daily threshold is met, with some exemptions. The measure would stay in place until encounters drop below an average of 1,500 per day. Officials in Hidalgo County told Flores that any measures to address the influx of asylum-seekers would need to take into account the cross-border traffic that generates economic activity in the area. A top official in Hidalgo County, Judge Richard Cortez, told Flores that Biden\u2019s action, while welcome, was a \u201cBand-Aid\u201d and not a permanent solution. \u201cComprehensive immigration reform remains the sole solution and Congress remains the sole venue to achieve this reform,\u201d Cortez said in a statement to Flores. Flores described her interviews with women who became victims of sexual violence while waiting on the Mexico side of the border for asylum claims to be processed and pointed to the vulnerable position today\u2019s action could force migrants into if they wait on the Mexico side of the border. Why now? CNN\u2019s Priscilla Alvarez, reporting from the White House, said part of the administration\u2019s calculus had been to wait until after Mexico\u2019s presidential election, which took place over the weekend, to announce this new action. Americans\u2019 ability to cut border crossings will rest, she said, in part on Mexico\u2019s ability to stop the flow of asylum-seekers within its borders. \u201cWe continue to work closely with our Mexican neighbors instead of attacking Mexico,\u201d Biden said at the White House, drawing a distinction between his approach and Trump\u2019s. Biden said he spoke with Mexico\u2019s president-elect on Monday. Trump holds an advantage on immigration CNN\u2019s Harry Enten notes that in the years since the Covid-19 pandemic, immigration has taken on increasing importance in the minds of voters. Troubling for Biden is that Trump is favored by 27 percentage points on the issue, according to polling from CNBC. Watch more from Enten: Long-standing authority Presidents have been using the authority to act on the border for decades; it is based in a 1950s immigration law. Here\u2019s the specific language: Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate. The authority has routinely been used, according to the Congressional Research Service, by all recent presidents to restrict entry to the US for specific groups of people, like Europeans at one point during the Covid-19 pandemic, suspected terrorists or officials from countries like Iran. A fact sheet released by the Department of Homeland Security outlines the specific changes in how noncitizens will be processed at the border. People apprehended and slated for expedited removal would need to express fear of returning to their home country in order to be interviewed about their situation. Otherwise, they will quickly be returned to either Mexico or their home country.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/politics/border-biden-trump-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_hunter-biden-trial-addiction-crisis-analysis", "text": "Whatever one thinks of the Hunter Biden criminal case, the start of the federal gun trial involving the president\u2019s son this week in Delaware laid bare a sobering aspect of American life that transcends partisan politics: a nation struggling with addiction. The trial comes as federal, state,\u00a0and local officials have\u00a0been battling\u00a0an epidemic of drug overdoses across the country in states both red and blue, including those involving the highly potent opioid fentanyl. Hunter Biden has pleaded\u00a0not guilty\u00a0to charges of illegally purchasing and possessing a gun while abusing or being addicted to drugs, a violation of federal law. After prospective jurors were sworn in Monday inside Wilmington\u2019s J. Caleb Boggs federal building, the judge overseeing the case read aloud a list of questions that would be used in winnowing down the group of residents who would rule on the case against Hunter Biden. \u201cHave you, a family member or a close friend ever suffered from drug or alcohol abuse, or been addicted to drugs or alcohol in any way?\u201d asked the judge. Another question probed whether potential jurors or their close associates had ever sought treatment for drug use. During their, at times, emotional answers, prospective juror after juror described how drug use had afflicted people they knew. One potential juror described their daughter\u2019s struggle with addiction, indicating that after recovery \u201ceverybody needs a second chance.\u201d Another prospective juror said their childhood best friend had died from an overdose of heroin. \u201cI have lost many friends to drug overdoses,\u201d said yet another potential juror. \u201cI feel it\u2019s an every day part of the world these days.\u201d Recent data underscore a troubling national picture of drug overdoses. About 42% of adults in the United States say they personally know at least one person who died from a\u00a0drug overdose, according to survey findings published earlier this year by the nonprofit research institute RAND Corporation. The report found that among adults who reported knowing someone who died by overdose, the average number of lives lost whom they knew was two \u2013 which illustrates the \u201cfar-reaching consequences\u201d of the nation\u2019s overdose crisis. \u201cThat number doesn\u2019t even account for the number of people who struggled with drugs or alcohol and didn\u2019t have an overdose,\u201d said Dr. Scott Hadland, an addiction expert with Boston\u2019s Mass General for Children. In addition to illuminating the sheer number of Americans impacted by addiction, Hunter Biden\u2019s trial is also creating critical awareness around the very language used to describe drug use. Medical experts and victim advocates have called for an end to the use of words like \u201caddict,\u201d opting for less judgmental descriptors like \u201cpeople experiencing addiction.\u201d \u201cAddiction is a disease,\u201d according to the\u00a0Partnership to End Addiction. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we use language that frames it as a health issue and shows respect to people with addiction and their families who are impacted. Just like we would with any other disease.\u201d \u201cWords like \u2018addict\u2019 are harmful because they contribute to stigma,\u201d said Hadland. \u201cStigma makes it difficult for people to seek help, including turning to family and friends for support. Amid a national overdose crisis, we want to make sure that people who need help feel comfortable seeking it out.\u201d Addiction experts also caution against generalizing about those using drugs, noting the issue impacts people across individual communities, political parties\u00a0and socio-economic status. \u201cThe reasons for why folks develop a substance use disorder are as varied as there are human beings on this planet,\u201d said Dr. Andy Mendenhall of the Oregon treatment and outreach organization Central City Concern. \u201cWhat we can say unequivocally is that multigenerational poverty, mental illness, depression, anxiety, job loss, [and] trauma are all part of the narrative of why folks seek to feel different through the use of substances.\u201d Even those responsible for enforcing the law and arresting criminal drug users and dealers say nuance is critical to helping steer individuals toward treatment as officials work to solve America\u2019s drug crisis. \u201cThis addictive behavior is not something to be taken lightly and, not to be like, \u2018Oh, just get a job,\u2019 or \u2018Just get help,\u2019\u201d Portland Police Chief Bob Day previously told CNN. \u201cThere are demons there that I could never understand. I want to get past some of the politics and get past some of the certitude about who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong and really recognize that lives are in the balance here.\u201d CNN\u2019s Deidre McPhillips, Marshall Cohen, and Jacqueline Howard contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/politics/hunter-biden-trial-addiction-crisis-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_02_politics_fact-check-trump-false-claim-lock-up-hillary-clinton", "text": "Former President Donald Trump falsely claimed in a new interview that he didn\u2019t make a \u201clock her up\u201d call for the imprisonment of his Democratic opponent of the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton. Trump, who\u00a0faces the possibility of a prison sentence\u00a0after he was convicted last week on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, was asked\u00a0in an interview aired Sunday\u00a0on Fox News about how he had \u201cfamously said\u2026\u00a0\u2018lock her up\u2019\u201d in relation to Clinton but did not jail her when he was president. During his answer, Trump said he had decided that imprisoning Clinton \u201cwould have been a terrible thing.\u201d Then he added: \u201cI didn\u2019t say \u2018lock her up,\u2019 but the people would all say \u2018lock her up, lock her up.\u2019\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cI didn\u2019t say \u2018lock her up\u2019\u201d is false. He called for Clinton\u2019s imprisonment on multiple occasions, including by\u00a0using the phrase \u201clock her up.\u201d Trump often used such rhetoric while criticizing Clinton\u2019s email practices as secretary of state during the Obama administration, which prompted a federal investigation. She was never charged with a crime. During campaign rallies in 2016, Trump sometimes\u00a0paused\u00a0his remarks as his supporters engaged in chants of \u201clock her up,\u201d giving the chants time to continue. On other occasions, he explicitly repeated those words himself. \u201cFor what she\u2019s done, they should lock her up,\u201d Trump\u00a0said\u00a0after the crowd chanted \u201clock her up\u201d at an October 2016 rally in North Carolina. \u201c\u2018Lock her up\u2019 is right,\u201d he\u00a0said\u00a0at an October 2016 rally in Pennsylvania. Trump also explicitly called for Clinton\u2019s imprisonment using different phrasing. \u201cHillary Clinton has to go to jail, OK? She has to go to jail,\u201d he\u00a0said\u00a0in a June 2016 speech in California. \u201cShe has to go to jail,\u201d he\u00a0repeated\u00a0in an October 2016 speech in Florida.\u00a0And at a presidential debate in October 2016, after Clinton\u00a0said,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country,\u201d Trump responded, \u201cBecause you\u2019d be in jail.\u201d Trump\u00a0softened his rhetoric\u00a0shortly after he defeated Clinton in the election, saying he didn\u2019t want to hurt her and didn\u2019t feel strongly about prosecuting her. In his 2020 campaign for reelection, though, he again made calls to \u201clock her up.\u201d \u201cYou should lock her up, I\u2019ll tell you,\u201d he\u00a0said\u00a0at a January 2020 rally in Ohio. At an October 2020 rally in Georgia, after the crowd chanted \u201clock them up\u201d in relation to the Biden family, Trump\u00a0said, \u201cYou should lock them up. Lock up the Bidens.

{"id": "2024_06_05_politics_biden-age-wall-street-journal-report-analysis", "text": "It\u2019s the recurring threat President Joe Biden\u2019s reelection bid will never be able to fully outrun. The White House was forced into a fresh damage control effort Wednesday to defend the 81-year-old commander in chief\u2019s acuity as he embarked on a grueling foreign trip and as the race gets nastier by the day. The latest episode was sparked by a Wall Street Journal article that cited descriptions \u2013 disputed by the White House \u2013 of the president\u2019s state of mind and fitness from what it described as more than 45 interviews with both Democrats and Republicans. The president was depicted as speaking so softly in one meeting about Ukraine that he was almost unintelligible to some participants. Other sources questioned whether he was fully in command of key details of his own policies. Democrats accused Republicans quoted or referred to in the account of making false claims and contradicting previous statements to damage Biden politically. Washington Sen. Patty Murray, for instance, complained on X that her comments to the Journal about the president\u2019s strong engagement in a meeting on Ukraine in January were not used by the paper. Biden has managed to tamp down previous kerfuffles over his age and capabilities this year with a robust public performance at his State of the Union address in March. He so surpassed Republican expectations that some in the party absurdly flipped from portraying him as doddering and incompetent to suggesting he must be drugged up. But all it takes is one halting on-camera moment or media report to revive the frenzy over Biden\u2019s age. This was inevitable as soon as the president decided to run for a second term that would begin when he is 82 and would end when he\u2019s 86. Biden\u2019s team habitually dismisses any concern over his capacity, and his doctors have certified him fit for duty. Democrats often claim this is an issue hyped up by the media, while pointing out that presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump isn\u2019t young either \u2013 he turns 78 next week. This particular Wall Street Journal article may be a Beltway drama that isn\u2019t occupying the minds of most voters. But they are concerned about Biden\u2019s age. And the question of the president\u2019s fitness for office is a legitimate one even if Republican efforts to portray him as weak and incoherent have obvious political motivations. In an ABC News/Ipsos poll in February, for instance, 86% of Americans thought Biden was too old to serve another term. That included 59% of Americans who thought both he and Trump were too old and 27% who thought only Biden was too old. Voters can also see it for themselves. The president has clearly slowed in office. He does often speak quietly and mangle his words more than he did even as a gaffe-prone senator and vice president. The job of commander in chief is one of the most exacting in the world, involves constant life-and-death decisions and comes with no genuine days off. Public speculation about the capacity of the president is also a highly sensitive issue \u2014 and is often indulged in by pundits with no medical expertise. Millions of Americans have some familiarity with the indignities of aging. That may offer Biden some sympathy, but it\u2019s also a reason why many have concerns about an octogenarian serving as commander in chief. Biden defiant about his capabilities Biden \u2014 who was one of the youngest senators in US history and is now its oldest sitting president \u2014 bristles when asked whether he\u2019s too old to be president, or would be late in his second term when he\u2019d reach his mid 80s. \u201cI can do it better than anybody you know.\u00a0You\u2019re looking at me, I can take you too,\u201d Biden quipped to a reporter in a recent Time Magazine interview. \u201cWatch me. Look, name me a president that\u2019s gotten as much done as I\u2019ve gotten done in my first three and a half years.\u201d Massimo Calabresi, Time\u2019s Washington bureau chief, said that during their meeting, Biden came across \u201cvery much as he appears on TV,\u201d adding, \u201cHe is older than when he started in office. It\u2019s visible if you just look side by side on the tape.\u201d In his story, Calabresi wrote: \u201cThe President, with his stiff gait, muffled voice, and fitful syntax, cut a striking contrast with the intense, loquacious figure who served as Senator and Vice President.\u201d The debate over Biden\u2019s age is rendered more complex since he\u2019s running against a 77-year-old. Trump might come across as more energetic than his successor, whom he\u2019s dubbed \u201cSleepy Joe,\u201d but the former president himself often appeared to be snoozing during his criminal trial in New York. The campaign trail version of Trump raises other concerns \u2014 not least because of his volcanic demeanor and estrangement from the truth. But Trump, like Biden, has recently bungled names, misidentified people and offered nonsensical public comments. Fitness for office is often in the eye of the beholder. The Republicans who insist Biden is too diminished see no reason why a twice-impeached convicted felon who has echoed Nazi rhetoric and is promising to use presidential powers in a personal quest for \u201cretribution\u201d against his enemies should not return to the Oval Office. Biden is increasingly focusing on Trump\u2019s mental capacity. He has told audiences in fundraising events recently that \u201csomething snapped\u201d after Trump lost the 2020 election and that he\u2019s \u201cclearly unhinged.\u201d Has Biden slowed or is he \u2018savvy and effective\u2019? The Journal article, headlined \u201cBehind Closed Doors, Biden Shows Signs of Slipping,\u201d detailed anecdotes about the president\u2019s attentiveness in meetings. It said that Democrats and Republicans reported that he has slowed and that some of his engagement and energy fluctuated and that he had good days and bad days. The Journal noted, however, that most of those who were critical of Biden\u2019s performance were Republicans. The paper quoted former Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy saying, \u201cHe\u2019s not the same person.\u201d Current House Speaker Mike Johnson worried the president\u2019s memory \u201chad slipped about the details of his own policy,\u201d the Journal wrote, citing six people who had been told about the speaker\u2019s views. (The White House denied Biden had misspoken during that exchange.) Neither speaker is a disinterested observer. Both have vested political interests in playing into Trump\u2019s claims that Biden is too old or absent to serve. The White House responded to the Journal story by saying in a statement that \u201cCongressional Republicans, foreign leaders and nonpartisan national-security experts have made clear in their own words that President Biden is a savvy and effective leader who has a deep record of legislative accomplishment.\u201d White House spokesman Andrew Bates added: \u201cNow, in 2024, House Republicans are making false claims as a political tactic that flatly contradict previous statements made by themselves and their colleagues.\u201d There is no current public evidence that Biden is unable to carry out the most onerous duties of his job that include making vital decisions to ensure the country\u2019s national security, especially in emergencies and at times of crisis. Still, the public facing part of the presidency is also important. A fair-minded person cannot help but note that Biden is not the same dynamic room-filling force that he was for years. The break that Biden and his aides enjoyed from questions about his age after his barnstorming State of the Union address followed a previous age-related frenzy. Special counsel Robert Hur\u2019s February report into Biden\u2019s handling of classified documents described him as a \u201cwell-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory\u201d and a transcript of the encounter showed Biden occasionally flustered and searching for dates. But the totality of the encounter doesn\u2019t support Republican claims of advanced cognitive decline. The report, however, was followed by a disastrous press appearance that served more to highlight questions of age than dampen them. \u201cI know what the Hell I am doing,\u201d the president said. But at one point, he compounded his problem when he meant to talk about the president of Egypt in a comment about the Middle East crisis but mistakenly said \u201cthe president of Mexico.\u201d On other occasions in February, Biden twice referred to dead European leaders \u2014 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl \u2013 when referring to conversations with their modern-day counterparts. Biden\u2019s stamina will be tested in the long haul to November\u2019s election. In the coming weeks, he has the kind of schedule that would exhaust anyone. He\u2019s due to return from France on Sunday, and is expected to fly to California for fundraising, before crossing the Atlantic again for the G7 summit in Italy next weekend. Even for someone with their own plane, it\u2019s a heavy lift at 81. Then he faces the most critical phase in his reelection campaign so far: his June 27 debate with Trump on CNN, which represents the most high-profile test of a sitting president\u2019s capabilities on live television since a much younger Ronald Reagan confronted similar questions in his 1984 reelection race. Presidents have great power. But even they cannot turn back the ravages of time. So it will not be long before Biden is once again called on to insist that he\u2019s not too old to serve.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/politics/biden-age-wall-street-journal-report-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_politics_2024-election-legal-entanglement", "text": "The political spotlight of a presidential election entangled in unprecedented legal drama will shift this week from the criminal trial of a former president to one of a sitting president\u2019s son as the campaign enters an intense new phase. Four days after presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump was convicted on 34 counts in his hush money trial in New York, President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter will be called to answer for federal gun charges in Wilmington, Delaware. The trial promises to be a moment of searing personal anguish for the president and comes as he\u2019s seeking to find a political opening after weeks of coverage of Trump\u2019s case. Later this week, the president is expected to issue a sweeping executive action that would dramatically limit migrants\u2019 ability to seek asylum at the southern border. The move, a pivotal moment of Biden\u2019s term and the campaign, will be seen as an effort to blunt Trump\u2019s advantage on an issue that is a foundation of his political career. But it could also risk angering progressive voters who are vital to the president\u2019s hopes of victory in November but have soured on some of his policies, including his support for Israel. Democrats will also seek this week to highlight what they warn are extreme right-wing policies on abortion as the heat of the campaign ratchets up ahead of the first presidential debate, on CNN, at the end of the month. Biden\u2019s effort to seize the initiative in a too-close-to-call campaign will come as the reverberations multiply over the first conviction of a former president and major party nominee. Republicans have mostly closed rank around Trump, claiming that he is a victim of weaponized justice, and the former president\u2019s team and the Republican National Committee are boasting about what they say is a $70 million fundraising spurt following the verdict. Democrats are, meanwhile, debating how to leverage Trump\u2019s conviction, with some calling for a sharper effort to blast Biden\u2019s foe as a convicted felon. It\u2019s too early to tell whether the guilty verdict will have a significant political impact in a nation long polarized by attitudes toward the former president. But a CBS/YouGov poll released Sunday showed that Americans believe 57% to 43% that the Manhattan jury reached the right verdict. And in a new ABC/Ipsos poll, Americans said by a roughly 2-to-1 margin that the verdict was right; however, views of Trump were barely changed from before the jury\u2019s decision. Trump was convicted of falsifying business records to hide a payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. He had pleaded not guilty and plans to appeal. While the charges in the New York hush money case are considered the least politically damaging of four criminal cases against Trump, the conviction represents an ignominious moment for a twice-impeached former president who had previously enjoyed a lifetime of impunity. The trial will resonate throughout the campaign, since Trump\u2019s sentencing is set for July 11, just four days before the opening of the Republican National Convention, and the former president is vowing to turn November\u2019s election into personal vindication over what he inaccurately claims is political persecution by the Biden administration. Trump compares the US to South American dictatorships The Republican embrace of the party\u2019s presumptive nominee \u2014 despite his conviction by a jury of his own peers \u2014 is a remarkable spectacle as one of the country\u2019s two major parties effectively turns its back on the rule of law. The move suggests that in a possible second term that Trump has vowed to use as \u201cretribution\u201d against his political foes, he would be unconstrained by his party and potentially the law. Trump told Fox News in an interview aired Sunday morning that he was a victim. \u201cIt\u2019s weaponization, and it\u2019s a very dangerous thing. We\u2019ve never had that in this country. They do have it in other countries, in South American countries,\u201d he said. His inflammatory remarks did not reflect the fact that his refusal to accept his 2020 election loss and his demagoguery are far more reflective of developing-world banana republics than a fair jury trial. Lara Trump, the ex-president\u2019s daughter-in-law and the RNC co-chair, told CNN\u2019s Kasie Hunt on \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday that Trump had been treated unfairly. \u201cIf his name had been anything other than Donald Trump, this case would have never seen the light of day,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat people are seeing now is that they can\u2019t trust our judicial system. (People) are very worried about the America that we are facing if this is the precedent we are setting in the United States.\u201d Democrats are rejecting the GOP claim that Trump could never get a fair trial in New York because it\u2019s a liberal city. Some key party figures are also seeking to exploit the guilty verdict politically, even as Biden has stayed largely above the fray after saying the verdict showed no one was above the law. California Rep. Adam Schiff, who is running for the Senate, had a simple answer for Trump\u2019s complaints about the jury pool in the city where the former president made his name. \u201cThat jury was selected in part by Donald Trump and his attorneys. They vetted each of the jurors. He had every right that every other criminal defendant has in that courtroom,\u201d Schiff said, also on \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday. \u201cThis ordinary jury of peers found him guilty on every single count. So, if you don\u2019t want to be tried in New York, don\u2019t commit crimes in New York.\u201d Biden spotted with son ahead of his trial The start of jury selection in the first-ever trial of a child of a sitting president could blunt claims by the GOP that the Justice Department targets only Republicans at a time when a Democratic senator, Robert Menendez of New Jersey, is also on trial in New York. The indictment of Hunter Biden was brought by Trump-appointed prosecutor David Weiss, who was elevated to special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland last year to oversee the probe.\u00a0The president\u2019s only living son is accused of illegally purchasing and possessing a gun while abusing or being addicted to drugs, a violation of federal law. He has pleaded not guilty to the three charges. The White House has ruled out the possibility of a pardon, but the president has said his son did nothing wrong and that he has turned his life around after struggles with alcohol and crack cocaine addiction. Hunter Biden is entitled to the same presumption of innocence and a trial by a jury of his peers that Trump was. In a symbolic show of support, the president was seen with his son on a bike ride near his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, home Saturday. While Democrats hope to use Trump\u2019s conviction in their quest to win over independent and moderate voters in the swing states that decide the election, they will also try this week to get more political oxygen for their key campaign themes after the ex-president\u2019s trial dominated headlines since mid-April. As well as Biden\u2019s big immigration announcement, Democrats will seek to train attention on hardline Republican policies on abortion. The Democratic National Committee is, for instance, planning to highlight on Monday a Texas Supreme Court ruling last week that said a medical exemption in the state\u2019s new abortion law applies only when there is a risk of death or serious physical impairment. Democrats say the law is the kind of measure Republicans would seek to implement nationwide if Trump, who built the Supreme Court majority that overturned Roe v. Wade, wins a second term. The ex-president insists, however, abortion policy should be left to the states. Democrats line up abortion attacks In another sign of a widening Democratic offensive on reproductive rights, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York announced he will hold a vote on a \u201cright to contraception\u201d bill Wednesday as Democrats mark two years this month since the Supreme Court overturned the nationwide constitutional right to an abortion. \u201cDonald Trump and MAGA Republicans will not be able to outrun their anti-abortion records, because the American people know that if given the chance, extremist Republicans will not stop in their campaign to strip away fundamental liberties in this country,\u201d Schumer said in a letter to his Democratic caucus. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Sunday previewed how his party is seeking to simultaneously stress Trump\u2019s conviction and autocratic rhetoric while trying to get attention for its own agenda. The New York Democrat said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that a jury had delivered justice in an \u201caffirmation of the American judicial system,\u201d adding, \u201cThis is America. We are not a system that is occupied by a monarch or a king or a dictator. We are a democracy, and in a democracy, no one is above the law.\u201d Jeffries also pivoted to a broader campaign message, arguing that Democrats would lower housing costs and tackle high prices, which are souring many people on the president\u2019s economic agenda. Jeffries said while Republicans were lying for Trump, Democrats would deal with the issues most voters find important. \u201cI\u2019d rather be on President Biden\u2019s side of that contrast than on the extreme MAGA Republican side,\u201d he said. Trump, after complaining bitterly nearly every day that the trial kept him off the campaign trail, is not leaping back into the fray immediately. He is, however, expected to embark on a fundraising swing this week that will include a stop in Beverly Hills, California, on Friday and a rally Sunday in the battleground state of Nevada. In the press release previewing the rally, Trump\u2019s team did not mention his conviction but instead hit an economic message. \u201cWeak Joe Biden and his woke Democrat friends have declared a war on the middle class.\u202fNevadans are suffering under Bidenomics\u202fwith inflation in Nevada,\u201d the release said, also highlighting high gasoline prices. Sen. Tom Cotton, who has drawn buzz as a potential Trump running mate, leaned into the former president\u2019s economic pitch on NBC. \u201cThe real verdict is going to come on Election Day, and it\u2019s going to come from the American people,\u201d the Arkansas Republican said Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be based on things like they can\u2019t pay for their rent and put food on the table for their kids; the border is chaos; we\u2019ve got war all around the world.\u201d The emerging economic argument between the two campaigns shows that Trump\u2019s legal quagmire, despite dominating campaign coverage for months and drawing core Republican voters around the ex-president, may not, in the end, be the issue that decides who will serve as president after January.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/politics/2024-election-legal-entanglement/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "politics"}}
