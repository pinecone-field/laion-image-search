Malinconico is\u00a0an independent\u00a0and a\u00a0college geology professor in Northampton\u00a0County, Pennsylvania, a bellwether area in one of the nation\u2019s most\u00a0competitive presidential battlegrounds. \u201cI\u2019m extremely\u00a0concerned,\u201d Malinconico said just after the\u00a0CNN debate Thursday night. \u201cPresident Biden performed poorly, His voice was weak. He stumbled and had difficulty staying on track with his answers.\u201d Still, he\u00a0cannot fathom the alternative and ended his debate night take with this: \u201cDespite my significant\u00a0concerns about Biden\u2019s\u00a0capabilities,\u00a0I will still vote against Trump.\u201d But early Friday afternoon, Malinconico reached out to add this: \u201cAfter sleeping on the debate overnight \u2026 now I\u2019m much more in favor of supporting moves to have President Biden drop out or for an open (brokered perhaps)\u00a0convention.\u201d It was one of a flood of voter reactions highly\u00a0critical of the president\u2019s debate performance, and one of several suggesting the debate, at least in the short term, damaged the incumbent\u2019s standing with voters\u00a0critical to his reelection\u00a0 hopes. Pat Levin is another\u00a0Northampton\u00a0County resident. The 94-year-old told us when we first met a few months ago that she was not worried about Biden\u2019s age. She is still planning to vote Biden, but her reaction was also quite telling. Levin had nice things to say about Vice President Kamala Harris and\u00a0California Gov. Gavin Newsom, praising their interviews after the debate. \u201cNothing good to say,\u201d though, about Biden \u2013 and the overall substance of the\u00a0CNN Presidential Debate. \u201cBiden whispered, spoke haltingly and appeared exceedingly vulnerable,\u201d Levin, told\u00a0CNN in a text message. \u201cIt was a sad night for American politics.\u201d Michael Pesce, a self-described Reagan Republican who says he\u00a0cannot support Trump, offered a similar take. \u201cLast night was a horror show,\u201d Pesce said Friday. \u201cBiden looked old and doddering and not at all presidential. Trump was angry and bombastic\u00a0and unable to say anything truthful.\u201d Pesce told us in May he would reluctantly vote for Biden because he sees Trump as unfit for the presidency. His morning after debate take was telling \u2013 and, again, troublesome for Biden. \u201cThe Democrats need to have an open\u00a0convention and rally behind a much younger\u00a0candidate,\u201d Pesce said. Pesce, 60, lives in Bucks\u00a0County in the\u00a0Philadelphia\u00a0suburbs, and like Northampton, is a battleground within the battleground. Malinconico, Levin and Pesce are participating in a\u00a0CNN project designed to track the 2024\u00a0campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in the\u00a0 battlegrounds and are part of\u00a0critical voting blocs. There are 60 voters participating so far, across 10 states, and they are diverse in every way. But the overwhelming\u00a0consensus after the debate, from Democrats and Republicans alike, was that Biden\u2019s showing was alarming. \u201cI\u2019m really scared that if Biden stays on the ticket, Trump is going to win,\u201d said Davette Baker, an African American and longtime Democratic\u00a0organizer in Milwaukee. And while strong Trump supporters were happy with his performance, the former president, too, faced some harsh\u00a0criticism from many of our voters, even\u00a0Republicans. \u201cSame old Donald, talked about himself,\u201d said Matt Vrahiotes, a\u00a0Christian\u00a0conservative who owns a small winery in Hall\u00a0County, Georgia. \u201cStroked his ego.\u201d Still,\u00a0Vrahiotes said Trump \u201cseems to be more\u00a0cognitive and mentally sharper.\u201d When we first\u00a0met, Vrahiotes said he would\u00a0consider a third party option, and his after the debate take reflected his\u00a0continued despair at the major party\u00a0choices. \u201cWhy not allow Kennedy on stage,\u201d he said of independent\u00a0candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who failed to meet the\u00a0CNN debate\u00a0criteria. Four big takeaways from our voters: \u2013\u2013 Those already unhappy with their\u00a0choices\u00a0came away from the debate even more sour about a Biden-Trump rematch. \u201cI hate that Trump talks down about America,\u2019\u201d said Antonio Munoz, a veteran who owns a Las Vegas restaurant and\u00a0catering business. \u201cI\u2019m not motivated to vote. Biden\u2019s\u00a0closing was weak.\u201d \u2013\u2013 Younger voters who align with Biden on many issues but feel little\u00a0connection with him because of his age were taken aback by his performance. \u201cI was genuinely shocked,\u201d said\u00a0Christine Ngyuen, 29, a former nurse who recently opened a Boba tea house in the Atlanta suburb of Decatur. \u201cBoth of our\u00a0candidates are far too old to be doing what they are doing,\u201d said Summer Matkin, a student at Wayne State University who lives in the Detroit suburbs. \u2014 Committed Democrats who plan to vote for Biden regardless of his performance still voiced exasperation because the debate reinforced their worries Trump\u00a0could win the election. \u201cIt felt like he let Trump drive a dangerously false narrative and\u00a0could do nothing more than say, \u2018That\u2019s a lie\u2019 without fully establishing the truth strongly,\u201d said Anushka Jalistagi, a recent University of Michigan graduate and former\u00a0co-president of the\u00a0campus\u00a0College\u00a0Democrats. \u2014 Trump supporters approved of his debate performance but there was no evidence in our group that he gained support. \u201cSad. We don\u2019t have the sharpest tacks in the box to vote for,\u201d said Kim\u00a0Cavaliere, a nurse in suburban Atlanta who is undecided and unhappy with her\u00a0choices. \u201cI bet other\u00a0countries are laughing at us. I was.\u201d Ibrahim Ghazal, a Palestinian-American law student from the Detroit area, is angry with Biden over the Hamas-Israel\u00a0conflict and leaning against voting for him again. But he had a dim view of Trump before the debate, and a dimmer one after. \u201cTrump had much better stage presence than Biden,\u201d Ghazal said in a text Friday. \u201cWhat was most disturbing to me was that Trump used the word \u2018Palestinian\u2019 as a slur.\u201d This was Trump during an exchange about the Hamas-Israel\u00a0conflict: \u201cYou should let them go and let them finish the job. He doesn\u2019t want to do it. He has become like a Palestinian. But, they don\u2019t like him because he is a very bad Palestinian. He is a weak one.\u201d Linda Rooney, a registered Republican who lives just\u00a0outside of Philadelphia,\u00a0voted for Biden in 2020 but said this year she would either \u201chold my nose\u201d and vote for Trump or write in a\u00a0conservative. There are 18 weeks left in the\u00a0campaign, but Trump\u2019s debate showing\u00a0did not win a\u00a0commitment from Rooney. \u201cLast night\u2019s debate was a disaster for Biden but what scares me more is that the Republicans\u00a0can\u2019t say they have a good\u00a0candidate either,\u201d she said. \u201cHow did my party get to the point where the only way we may win the presidency again is because we are up against someone who is feeble and not well? \u2026 Republicans should not be taking\u00a0a victory lap.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/politics/voters-trump-biden-debate-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_07_01_politics_why-student-loan-payments-are-paused-for-3-million-borrowers", "text": "A federal appeals court will allow the Department of Education to proceed with lowering millions of student loan borrowers\u2019 monthly payments in July as the Biden administration faces two legal battles over the repayment plan known as SAVE (Saving on a Valuable Education), which launched last year. Two groups of Republican-led states filed lawsuits earlier this year challenging the SAVE plan, arguing that the administration does not have the legal authority to implement the plan. Missouri and Kansas judges issued temporary injunctions last week, halting parts of the SAVE plan while the matter can be fully litigated. SAVE lowers enrolled borrowers\u2019 monthly payments and provides a faster route to debt forgiveness. It was launched by the Biden administration after the president\u2019s sweeping, one-time student loan forgiveness program was struck down by the Supreme Court last summer. The Missouri judge blocked the Biden administration from canceling any more student loan debt under the SAVE plan. And the Kansas judge said that the Biden administration would not be allowed to fully phase in the SAVE plan in July and lower payments by as much as half for some enrolled borrowers. The Department of Justice appealed both injunctions. On Sunday, the US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit ruled that the Biden administration can go ahead and lower monthly student loan payments this month as originally scheduled. The appeals court did not overrule the injunction but allows this part of the plan to take effect while the matter is litigated. Here\u2019s what borrowers need to know: Payments paused for some borrowers enrolled in SAVE Nearly 8 million people are enrolled in SAVE, and roughly 3 million of them were expecting to see lower payments as of July 1 when the SAVE plan was fully phased in. After the injunctions were put in place last week, the Department of Education said that those 3 million borrowers would be put in a forbearance \u2013 during which payments would not be required and interest would not accrue \u2013 while the matter was litigated. But after the appeals court sided with the Biden administration on Sunday, the Department of Education can move ahead and make those reductions. Some affected borrowers had not yet been placed in a forbearance. If those borrowers already received a bill from their loan servicer that reflects the new, lower payment for July, they should make that payment. Those borrowers who were put in a forbearance last week due to the injunction will remain in a payment pause in July and be required to make their new, lower monthly payment starting in August. About 4 million other borrowers enrolled in SAVE already have a $0 monthly payment. SAVE is an income-driven repayment plan, which calculates payments based on a borrower\u2019s income and family size. Payments can be as low as $0 for people earning $30,000 or less a year. Student debt forgiveness under SAVE halted Borrowers enrolled in SAVE may be eligible for student debt relief in a shorter amount of time than under other income-driven repayment plans. Those who borrowed $12,000 or less will see their debt forgiven after paying for just 10 years under SAVE. Every additional $1,000 borrowed above that amount would add one year of monthly payments to the required time a borrower must pay. Under other repayment plans, borrowers must make at least 20 years of payments before receiving debt forgiveness. To date, $5.5 billion has been canceled for 414,000 people enrolled in SAVE. But the Missouri court\u2019s injunction that remains in place blocks the Biden administration from canceling anymore student debt under SAVE until the matter is fully litigated. Online access to SAVE application will be restored When the injunctions were put in place last week, the Department of Education took down the online application for any income-driven repayment plans, including SAVE, so that it could update its systems to reflect the injunctions. As of July 1, the department said it is working on reinstating the online application. The Department of Education said that borrowers should check in regularly with\u00a0studentaid.gov\u00a0and subscribe here to receive the latest information. How does SAVE work? Like existing income-driven repayment plans, SAVE offers lower monthly payments for people with lower incomes. But the SAVE plan offers the most generous terms. SAVE lowers monthly payments in two ways compared with other federal student loan repayment plans. First, it recalculates discretionary income so that it\u2019s equal to the difference between a borrower\u2019s adjusted gross income and 225% of the poverty level. Existing income-driven plans calculate discretionary income as the difference between income and 150% of the poverty level. Under most income-driven repayment plans, borrowers are required to pay 10% of their discretionary income. But borrowers enrolled in SAVE will see those payments cut by as much as half in July. Payments on loans borrowed for undergraduate school will be reduced from 10% to 5% of discretionary income. Borrowers who have loans from both undergraduate and\u00a0graduate school will pay a weighted average of between 5% and 10% of their income based upon the original principal balances of their loans. The SAVE plan also prevents balances from ballooning due to interest when a borrower has a small monthly payment. If enrolled in SAVE, unpaid interest does not accrue if a borrower makes a fully monthly payment. For example, if $50 in interest accumulates each month and a borrower\u2019s full required payment is just $30, the remaining $20 would be waived. Confusion for borrowers The court injunctions impacting the SAVE plan come at a time when many borrowers were already experiencing issues with their student loan payments \u2013 which resumed last fall after a three-plus year pause during the Covid-19 pandemic. Some borrowers were recently put in an administrative forbearance because their accounts were being transferred from one loan servicer to another. Others were being put in a forbearance because the recalculation of their payments under SAVE had not been completed yet. \u201cThis may just be politics to the leaders of Missouri and Kansas, but for 40 million people trying to manage their student loans, it\u2019s chaos,\u201d Abby Shafroth, co-director of Advocacy at the National Consumer Law Center, said in a statement.

{"id": "2024_06_20_politics_colin-allred-border-texas-senate-race", "text": "Democratic Rep. Colin Allred of Texas, who\u2019s challenging GOP Sen. Ted Cruz in the Republican-leaning state this fall, is promising to \u201cfix the border\u201d in a new ad, declaring that he \u201cstood up to Joe Biden on the border.\u201d But just two years ago, the congressman dismissed the issue as one playing out in the \u201cright-wing echo chamber,\u201d despite a sharp increase of migrants at the US-Mexico border at the time. Allred, a former NFL player and civil rights attorney who represents the northeast Dallas area, made his comments in February 2022 as the US was seeing a surge in migrants at the border compared with during the Trump administration \u2013 and even compared with the previous year under Biden, which smashed past records of encounters at the border. Asked about Republicans running on the border \u2013 along with crime, inflation and \u201cwokeism\u201d in the 2022 midterms \u2013 Allred said he thought most voters were focused on inflation and the economy. \u201cI think some of those others may fall into, kind of, the right-wing echo chamber,\u201d Allred told CBS News\u2019 Major Garrett on \u201cThe Takeout\u201d podcast. \u201cI don\u2019t hear a lot about the border here in Dallas, and I\u2019m in a border state. Obviously, we want to have comprehensive immigration reform. We want to try and, you know, address some of these things,\u201d Allred said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not \u2013 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a top-of-mind issue,\u201d he added, going on to say that he believed voters were still frustrated about Covid-19. In February 2022, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded 166,010 encounters with migrants at the US-Mexico border, reflecting a significant increase from the 101,099 encounters in the same month the previous year \u2013 a rise of 64%. That surge was part of a larger trend in 2022, which saw a then-record 2.4 million migrant encounters \u2013 a huge increase compared with during the Trump administration, which saw its highest annual total enforcement actions in fiscal year 2019 with 1.15 million. By comparison, fiscal year 2021, which covered part of Biden\u2019s first year in office, saw 1.95 million total enforcement actions. Though Allred dismissed the political importance of the border at the time, a University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll from June 2021 found that 34% of Texas voters identified immigration and border security, combined, as the biggest concerns for the state (each at 17%) \u2013 ahead of Covid at just 5%. Today, border issues are an even greater concern for Texas voters. A University of Texas/Texas Politics Project poll in April found a significant majority of Texas voters described migrants crossing the US-Mexico border as a crisis (48%) or a very serious problem but not a crisis (23%). In his race to unseat Cruz, Allred is now spending at least $380,000 running an online ad exclusively dedicated to the border issue. Allred did not publicly announce the ad, as he has done for previous ads. \u201cI\u2019m Colin Allred. Fentanyl is flooding into our country. Our border is broken, and so are our politics. To fix it, we have to go after the cartels and fix the border,\u201d Allred says in the ad. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to do it in a way that upholds our values. Values passed down from my grandfather \u2013 a customs officer in Brownsville. I stood up to Joe Biden on the border and to extremists like Ted Cruz, who prefer chaos to real solutions. I\u2019m Colin Allred. I\u2019m running for Senate to fix this problem.\u201d The ad is running online, where Google ad transparency data shows that Allred has spent at least $280,000 promoting two versions of the spot that run 30 and 15 seconds \u2013 and have been shown more than 11 million times. On Facebook, Allred has spent more than $100,000 running the ad. In a statement to CNN, Allred campaign spokesperson Josh Stewart said: \u201cSince his first days in Congress, Congressman Allred has focused on bipartisan solutions to fix our broken immigration system and secure our border. During his 12 years in the Senate, Ted Cruz has shown that he only wants to play politics with the crisis at the border and that he will never be part of a bipartisan solution.\u201d A shift on the border Allred \u2013 who was first elected to Congress in 2018 by flipping a GOP-held seat in the Dallas suburbs \u2013 has sought to toughen many of his stances on the border and immigration enforcement ahead of the statewide election in November. He joined a Democratic-led border security task force this spring and said he supported the border security bill introduced earlier this year that was killed by\u00a0Republicans. That bill did not contain provisions for any undocumented immigrants, including a pathway to citizenship, which Allred has long pushed for, but he called it \u201ca much-needed step\u201d on immigration reform. Allred has also shifted his rhetoric on a border wall popularized by Trump. At a January 2018 town hall, when he was running to unseat GOP Rep. Pete Sessions, Allred pledged to personally tear down the wall if it was enacted instead of creating a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented. \u201cThis idea that we\u2019re going to trade this for a racist wall. Absolutely not. If they build that wall, I will be there tearing it down,\u201d he said. He would repeatedly refer to the border wall as \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cwasteful, ineffective\u201d and a \u201cfailed policy\u201d that was not needed over the next few years, though he said in 2019 that physical barriers were \u201csometimes appropriate.\u201d Years later, in October 2023, after the Biden administration announced construction of new sections of the wall at the US-Mexico border, using funds already allocated during the Trump administration, Allred praised the decision. \u201cThis is a necessary step to help Texas\u2019 overwhelmed border communities deal with this current surge of migrants,\u201d he told The Hill, adding that it was \u201conly a partial solution.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/politics/colin-allred-border-texas-senate-race/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_politics_guns-felons-abusers-illinois-supreme-court", "text": "The Supreme Court said Tuesday that it won\u2019t take up a challenge to parts of a federal law that bar convicted felons and drug users from possessing firearms, and let stand a ban on assault-style weapons in Illinois. The decisions come days after the high court upheld a separate provision of the same federal disarmament law in the biggest Second Amendment case to reach the justices in two years. The court\u2019s majority said a restriction on domestic abusers possessing firearms was constitutional because it was in line with a \u201ctradition of firearm regulation\u201d disarming dangerous individuals. Weeks after the Second Amendment featured prominently on the court\u2019s docket, the decisions on Tuesday amounted to a collective ducking of the issue of guns when the court returns in the fall. Among the cases the court declined to hear is one that could have unraveled Hunter Biden\u2019s federal firearms conviction. The court sent the challenges to the federal firearms bans back down to a lower court with instructions to review the case in light of their ruling last month in US v. Rahimi. In that case, Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for an 8-1 majority, said that a 2022 ruling from the court that changed the framework federal courts must use when examining the nation\u2019s gun laws did not necessarily lock lower courts into striking down any gun law that didn\u2019t have a direct historic analogue. Some court watchers had speculated that the court\u2019s opinion in Rahimi might address laws disarming felons, but the majority avoided directly wading into the legal debate over whether other federal gun prohibitions \u2013 including the one at issue in the present controversy \u2013 would also be upheld. \u201cAt least for now, the court seems unwilling to jump right back into the messy fight that it touched off two years ago in the Bruen case with respect to exactly what the Second Amendment does and doesn\u2019t prohibit,\u201d said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at Georgetown University Law Center. \u201cBut the punt here is necessarily temporary; lower courts are already bitterly divided over how they\u2019re supposed to review a number of different state and federal gun control laws,\u201d Vladeck added. \u201cIt\u2019s a good bet that, before their next term is over, the justices are going to have to step back in.\u201d The decisions to take or deny cases in the so-called clean-up list came a day after the Supreme Court handed down the final opinions of a contentious term, including the decision to grant sweeping immunity to former President Donald Trump. The court also dodged a number of other high-profile matters, either by declining them outright or sending them back to lower courts. The justices, for instance, declined an appeal challenging Section 230, a controversial law that provides legal protection to social media companies for posting third-party content. And it waved off a challenge about whether the Department of Labor can enforce workplace conditions on American businesses, an appeal that could have further weakened the power of federal agencies. While that case was ostensibly focused on one agency, OSHA, the political and legal underpinnings were far deeper: Conservatives have for years sought to revive what\u2019s known as the nondelegation doctrine, the idea that Congress can\u2019t hand off legislative decisions to the executive branch. A ruling against the Labor Department could have had profound implications for the balance of power between the branches of government. Disarming drug users The case related to Hunter Biden, US v. Daniels, was being closely followed because he was convicted in June of violating the same disarmament law at issue in the case, as well as two other federal firearm laws. His attorneys have consistently pointed to the Daniels case, in which a federal appeals court said the law was unconstitutional, as they sought to challenge his prosecution. Biden\u2019s attorneys are expected to lean on the appeals court ruling as they raise a post-conviction appeal. Patrick Daniels was stopped in 2022 for driving without a license plate. A search of the car uncovered several marijuana cigarette butts, a loaded pistol and a loaded rifle. The officers did not administer a drug test the night of the stop, but Daniels admitted that he was a frequent user of marijuana. A federal grand jury indicted Daniels for possessing a firearm as an unlawful user of a controlled substance, and a jury later convicted him of violated the firearms law. He had initially challenged the charges before conviction, citing Bruen. But a federal judge denied his request to throw out the indictment. A New Orleans-based appeals court later reversed, ruling last August that the law was unconstitutional as applied to Daniels. \u201cIn short, our history and tradition may support some limits on an intoxicated person\u2019s right to carry a weapon, but it does not justify disarming a sober citizen based exclusively on his past drug usage,\u201d Circuit Judge Jerry Smith, a Ronald Reagan appointee, wrote for the three-judge panel. \u201cNor do more generalized traditions of disarming dangerous persons support this restriction on nonviolent drug users.\u201d Illinois ban on assault-style weapons remains in effect The other cases the court declined to hear include ones challenging an Illinois law that bans semi-automatic weapons with certain features, such as those that have detachable magazines and also pistol grips, flash suppressors or removable stocks that make them easier to conceal. Justice Samuel Alito, among the court\u2019s stalwart conservatives, said he would have granted the Illinois cases dealing with assault-style weapons but did not write to explain his reasoning. Justice Clarence Thomas, also a conservative, was the only member of the court who wrote on the matter. \u201cWe have never squarely addressed what types of weapons are \u2018arms\u2019 protected by the Second Amendment,\u201d Thomas wrote. The \u201cminimal guidance\u201d the court has provided on the issue \u201cis far from a comprehensive framework for evaluating restrictions on types of weapons, and it leaves open essential questions such as what makes a weapon \u2018bearable,\u2019 \u2018dangerous,\u2019 or \u2018unusual.\u2019\u201d Gun rights groups have framed state bans on AR-style semi-automatic weapons as unconstitutional, particularly in light of blockbuster Supreme Court decisions in recent years that have vastly expanded the scope of the Second Amendment. They argue the weapons banned under the laws are \u201ccommon\u201d and that \u201clabeling them \u2018assault weapons\u2019 is nothing more than an argument advanced by a political slogan in the guise of a definition.\u201d New York\u2019s conceal-carry gun law The Supreme Court also declined to hear arguments from six New York residents challenging the state\u2019s recently approved regulations on carrying concealed firearms, including in \u201csensitive\u201d places such as schools, parks and concert venues. The decision to send that case back to lower courts for further review leaves in place most of a New York law approved in response to the Second Amendment blockbuster ruling two years ago. The legal fight over the new law will continue in lower courts and could return to the Supreme Court. Ban on felons possessing guns The felon disarmament cases involve individuals who are challenging their convictions for violating a federal law that prohibits felons \u2013 both violent and non-violent \u2013 from possessing a gun. The people at the center of those disputes include a man who pleaded guilty in 1995 to a single misdemeanor charge of welfare fraud under Pennsylvania law and a man whose criminal record included convictions in Iowa state courts for theft, aggravated use of a weapon, aggravated assault and intimidation with a dangerous weapon. In some of those cases, the Justice Department told the court that it needed clarity on whether that felon disarmament law is constitutional given how frequently it brings criminal cases under it, pointing to some 7,600 cases from fiscal year 2022 alone. \u201cThe present conflict is unlikely to resolve itself without further intervention by this court,\u201d Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar told the justices in court papers, adding that disagreement among lower federal courts about the law\u2019s constitutionality \u201cis undermining public safety.\u201d \u201cDistrict courts have struck down (the felon disarmament law) even as applied to exceptionally dangerous felons, including murderers, carjackers, and drug traffickers \u2013 and in some cases have ordered that the defendants be released pending appeal,\u201d Prelogar wrote.

{"id": "2024_06_27_politics_presidential-debate-trump-biden", "text": "The confrontation in Atlanta between Joe Biden and Donald Trump Thursday night has a good chance of becoming the most fateful presidential debate in US history. For the first time, a sitting president and an ex-president will lock horns before millions of viewers, in an encounter taking place far earlier than normal \u2014 even before the party conventions. The CNN-hosted showdown is the most pivotal moment yet in a neck-and-neck election, and it\u2019s Biden\u2019s best chance to shake up a reelection bid that he is in deep danger of losing as he struggles to convince voters that he\u2019s delivered the political and economic normality he promised in 2020. The debate comes at a moment when many Americans are seeking relief from high prices that have made it harder to feed their families and afford rents, mortgages, and new cars. It is unfolding amid an intense national debate over access to abortion that was unleashed by the conservative Supreme Court majority built by Trump. Deep divides over immigration and foreign policy in a world filled with new challenges to US power will form a contentious backdrop to a clash between two candidates who openly disdain one another. The debate in that sense personifies an election race that has left millions of Americans unsatisfied with the choice offered by two elderly candidates who alienate more voters than they attract. But the momentous circumstances of the occasion can only be fully understood alongside the context of the unprecedented politics of the times. Since Sen. John F. Kennedy and Vice President Richard Nixon staged\u00a0the first televised debate\u00a0in the 1960 campaign, there have been agonizingly close elections that have set the country on a sharply different course. But the stakes in 2024 are greater than ever because of Trump\u2019s attempt to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power based on false claims of fraud in the 2020 election and his promise to wage a never-before-seen presidency of personal vengeance if he wins in November. Biden plans to frame what he sees as Trump\u2019s threat to the rule of law and democracy in the starkest terms, sources familiar with the matter told CNN\u2019s Kayla Tausche. He will describe the mob attack by Trump\u2019s supporters on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, as a \u201cseismic,\u201d era-defining moment that must be a watershed for voters. \u201cThe embodiment of the threat is returning,\u201d said one Biden source. That backdrop means this presidential debate has a different cast than all its predecessors. Had Sen. John Kerry beaten President George W. Bush in 2004 or ex-Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney made President Barack Obama a one-term president in 2012, there would have been significant political change. But the character of the republic and its global posture would not have fundamentally altered. That assurance cannot be applied with any confidence to the current election. Trump\u2019s strongman impulse \u2013 epitomized by his claim before the Supreme Court that presidents have almost limitless power, as well as a blueprint for hardline new policies on immigration, the economy and foreign policy \u2013 means a second term could bring massive disruption. \u201c(It is) unbelievably historic. You cannot (over) hype up the importance of this,\u201d presidential historian Douglas Brinkley told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday. Democrats are desperate for the 81-year-old Biden to put on a show of vitality and sharpness amid concerns about his age. Seventy-eight-year-old Trump\u2019s biggest liability might be himself and the possibility of a performance that could validate Biden\u2019s warnings that he\u2019s too \u201cunhinged\u201d to be president. Biden is expected to hammer Trump over abortion \u2014 one of the few policy areas where he outpolls the former president \u2014 and his admiration of foreign dictators. Trump is already signaling he\u2019ll portray Biden\u2019s America in dystopian terms, beset by uncontrolled immigration, rampant crime and searing economic pain. The most extraordinary aspect of the debate is that it takes place less than a month after Trump was convicted in a criminal hush money case in New York. Biden has already highlighted the guilty verdict in campaign events, but Trump insists that he\u2019s the victim of an attempt to weaponize the legal system to interfere in the election. Both candidates are facing extreme pressure Both men will hope to avoid the kind of debate night gaffes or odd personal quirks that have often gone viral and dominated critical post-debate media coverage that helps cement the perception of who won and who lost in voters\u2019 minds. Vice President Al Gore\u2019s theatrical sighs in 2000 and President George H.W. Bush\u2019s unwise glance at his watch in 1992 both became emblems of losing campaigns. The risks are now much higher because of social media. Presidential debates don\u2019t always decide who wins in November. But the tension surrounding this year\u2019s first debate in June, rather than in September or October as usual, is palpable. \u201cThe closer the election, the greater the chance that a debate could influence it,\u201d said Aaron Kall, director of debate at the University of Michigan, who has conducted an in-depth study of every presidential debate. \u201cA lot of times these mistakes reaffirm a caricature of one of the particular candidates that existed before it happened.\u201d For Biden, that means no senior moments, and Trump would be advised to avoid outbursts that confirm Biden\u2019s characterization of a tyrant in waiting. Neither Trump nor Biden has debated since their final clash in the pandemic-disrupted 2020 campaign. And their preparation for one of the most important nights of their lives has reflected their character and political personas. The president has been out of sight for days, huddled below the oaks, poplars and maple trees at the Camp David retreat with advisers, strategizing how to handle the most challenging debate foe in history. Fueled by lasagna and tacos, he\u2019s taken part in mock debates, immersed himself in briefing binders and tried to anticipate Trump\u2019s wild twists and diversions. It\u2019s a debate camp in keeping with Biden\u2019s view that he\u2019s locked in an existential election duel with the soul of the nation on the line. The former president hates mock debates and has instead honed his preparation at rallies and events, trusting his instincts and intuition and a feral sense of an opponent\u2019s political weakness. He has, however, had policy refresher sessions with aides and some potential vice-presidential picks including Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Biden has raised the stakes for himself heading into the debate higher than those any modern president faced. He argues Trump is a criminal in whom something has \u201csnapped\u201d and who is too dangerous and reckless to be let back into the White House. He\u2019s also rebuked Trump for using Nazi-style language and warned democracy and freedom are on the ballot along with the capacity of \u2018We the People\u2019 to shape America\u2019s destiny. Preparing for anything at Camp David Biden\u2019s debate team is led by former White House chief of staff Ron Klain, who has been prepping Democrats for presidential debates for a generation. One of Klain\u2019s mantras is \u201cwhile you can lose a debate any time, you can only win it in the first 30 minutes.\u201d Biden is therefore expected to front-load the most important points to appeal to the likely highest rated part of the primetime event. The Biden team has been poring over Trump\u2019s recent public interviews and speeches while workshopping responses to whatever he and the moderators may throw Biden\u2019s way. The president will be ready for whichever version of Trump shows up \u2013 whether it\u2019s the bombastic opponent who talked over and insulted him in their first clash in 2020, or a more restrained challenger seeking to project stability. If Trump aims for a presidential bearing, Biden has a locker full of practiced attacks and rebuttals designed to provoke him into making the outbursts that could turn voters off. A Biden adviser told CNN that debate preparations have included getting the president ready to respond should Trump get personal\u00a0 \u2014 weeks after his son Hunter was convicted of felony gun charges. Biden\u2019s love and protective instinct for his family is always close to the surface, and he reacted furiously when the then-president brought up Hunter during their first debate in 2020. Biden has been running through his paces inside a large hangar at the Maryland retreat, where there\u2019s a mock debate stage complete with bright television lights. His personal attorney, Bob Bauer, is playing Trump and other aides have sat in as CNN moderators Dana Bash and Jake Tapper. But sources told CNN that the debate practice was about more than feeling comfortable. It\u2019s also about answering the age question. Aides and allies of the president alike have frequently pointed to his State of the Union address in March as a model example of Biden at his best. He was energetic, focused and nimble, they\u2019ve argued, over the course of his 67-minute prime-time speech. Trump\u2019s debate prep is as unorthodox as he is Sitting presidents often have a rude awakening at first presidential debates, since they are unused to anyone getting in their grill and contradicting them. But Trump\u2019s advantage on this score may be compromised since he refused to debate any of his GOP primary rivals this year. Still, his aggressive debate style isn\u2019t much different from the belligerent, spiky attitude he displays in most public events. Trump has warmed up for the debate by suggesting that Biden will be \u201cjacked up\u201d on drugs, as his aides frantically have tried to dismantle the expectations trap that the ex-president constructed for himself by suggesting that Biden is so mentally diminished that he can barely stand up or finish a sentence. In any other era, the idea of a candidate accusing an opponent of doping would be unthinkable. But Trump\u2019s tactic is a reminder of a presidency and a political style that has shattered all previous norms. In a new memo on Wednesday, Trump\u2019s campaign signaled that the ex-president would assail Biden over immigration and the economy. It boasted about polling averages that his team says show the former president up in all the key states. And Trump, whose administration created a gale of daily falsehoods, characteristically worked to accuse Biden of the very transgression that is most associated with him \u2014 lying. \u201cThe man is a walking lying machine and a fact-checker\u2019s dream,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social, while accusing Biden, one of the best presidential golfers, of being unable to hit a ball 10 yards. Trump\u2019s unorthodox approach means that the country may get another reminder of the chaos, discord and cacophony that it experienced in his four years in office \u2014 and that his supporters love and want to restore. But it\u2019s also a risk that could play into Biden\u2019s desire to get voters to see the contrast between the 45th and 46th presidents that he believes could deliver him the election. Former Obama speechwriter Terry Szuplat said successful debate performances tell a coherent story of where the country is and where it is going. \u201cIt\u2019s a story about yourself. Why you\u2019re the right candidate. Why the other candidate is the wrong candidate.\u00a0And it\u2019s a story about the future. Every election is about the future. It\u2019s a choice about the future,\u201d Szuplat told CNN\u2019s Kasie Hunt. Neither Trump nor Biden has so far fulfilled that goal. Thursday is the best chance to do so.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/politics/presidential-debate-trump-biden/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_election-biden-presidential-race-what-matters", "text": "Joe Biden\u2019s spotty debate performance immediately triggered new questions from worried Democrats about whether he would leave the presidential race. It would not be an easy process since Biden is already the Democrats\u2019 presumptive nominee and the overwhelming choice of primary voters. He faced little opposition during the primary season, and the fact that he won nearly all of the party\u2019s delegates means it\u2019s very unlikely he\u2019d be forced out of the race against his will. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the \u201960s. Voters choose the nominee. He is the nominee,\u201d said CNN analyst and Democratic strategist David Axelrod, reacting to Biden\u2019s performance at the debate Thursday night on CNN. That current primary system, which empowers primary voters over party bigwigs, essentially sprang from discontent after Democrats selected Vice President Hubert Humphrey as their nominee in 1968. Even after President Lyndon Johnson bowed out of the presidential race that year, recognizing his fading popularity and opposition to the war in Vietnam, Humphrey represented a continuation of Johnson\u2019s Vietnam policy at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Violence broke out when protesters clashed with police as Humphrey accepted the nomination. Things would be very different in 2024 if Biden decided to leave the race, although Democrats\u2019 convention will return to Chicago in August. As we\u00a0first wrote\u00a0back in February,\u00a0if the leading candidate was to drop out of the campaign after most primaries or even during the convention, individual delegates would need to select the party\u2019s nominee on the convention floor (or, potentially, during a\u00a0virtual roll call). That would shine a spotlight on the normally niche question of who those actual delegates are. The Democratic Party set a deadline of June 22 for states to select the more than 3,900 delegates \u2013\u00a0almost all of them currently pledged to Biden \u2013 allocated as part of the primary process. These delegates aren\u2019t just pledged to vote for Biden; they\u2019re also approved by his campaign. So while a majority of convention delegates could\u00a0decide to pick a new nominee, doing so would require massive defections from the president\u2019s own supporters. It also means that if Biden dropped out of the race, it would largely be Biden backers who would be responsible for picking his replacement. Who could replace Biden? You can assume, for instance, that Vice President Kamala Harris would be a top contender to be on the ballot in such a scenario. But there would be other potential candidates who previously argued they could run a more effective campaign against former President Donald Trump. Would someone like California Gov. Gavin Newsom \u2013\u00a0who offered unqualified support for Biden in the wake of Thursday\u2019s debate \u2013\u00a0challenge Harris at the convention? Settling on a replacement could be divisive and ugly. It would be up to the delegates to decide, in a series of votes after frantic lobbying, who to pick. On the Democratic side, there is also another group to consider: the\u00a0\u201csuperdelegates,\u201d\u00a0a group of about 700 senior party leaders and elected officials who are automatically delegates to the convention based on their position. Under normal party rules, they can\u2019t vote on the first ballot if they could swing the nomination, but they\u2019re free to vote on subsequent ballots. What if a candidate left the race after the convention? It would take a drastic event for a candidate to leave the race in the few months between a party\u2019s nominating convention in the summer and the general election in November. Democrats and Republicans have slightly different methods of dealing with this possibility. You can imagine the end result would probably be that the running mate stepped up to be on the general election ballot, but that is not necessarily guaranteed. Democrats \u2013\u00a0The Democratic National Committee is empowered to fill a vacancy on the national ticket after the convention under party rules, after the party chair consults with Democratic governors and congressional leadership. Republicans \u2013\u00a0If a vacancy occurs on the Republican side, the Republican National Committee can either reconvene the national convention or select a new candidate itself. Would the running mate automatically become the nominee? An in-depth\u00a0Congressional Research Service\u00a0memo also notes that if an incumbent president becomes incapacitated after winning the party\u2019s nomination, the 25th Amendment would elevate the vice president to the presidency, but party rules would determine who rises to become the party\u2019s nominee. Neither party, according to the CRS, requires that the presidential candidate\u2019s running mate be elevated to the top of the ticket, though that would obviously be the most likely scenario. Has a candidate ever left the race after the convention? In modern times, per the CRS, the Democrat running for vice president in 1972, Sen.\u00a0Thomas Eagleton, was forced to step aside after the convention after it was discovered that he was treated for mental illness. (1972 was a very different time! Today, thankfully, there is not nearly the stigma attached to mental health.) The DNC actually needed to convene a meeting to affirm Sargent Shriver as Democratic nominee George McGovern\u2019s second-choice running mate. What if a president-elect was incapacitated after the election? If a president-elect was to die, timing is again important. Under the Constitution, it is electors meeting in state capitols who technically cast votes for the presidency. While some states require that they vote for the winner of the election in their state, in others they have leeway. The CRS memo, which cites several congressional hearings on the subject, suggests it would clearly make sense for a vice president-elect to simply assume the role of president-elect, but the law itself is murky. Under the 20th Amendment, if a president-elect dies, his or her running mate, the vice president-elect, becomes president. There could be some question, for instance, about when exactly a person becomes president-elect. Is it after the electors meet in December, or after Congress meets to count Electoral College votes on January 6?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/politics/election-biden-presidential-race-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_politics_rfk-jr-eating-dog-vanity-fair", "text": "Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has denied allegations made in a new Vanity Fair report that he had previously eaten a dog while sidestepping accusations of sexual assault levied by a former nanny in the magazine, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not a church boy.\u201d In an interview with the \u201cBreaking Points\u201d political podcast released Tuesday, Kennedy called the Vanity Fair article \u201ca lot of garbage\u201d but acknowledged that his past included \u201cmany skeletons in my closet.\u201d The article alleges that Kennedy texted a message to a friend last year that included a photograph that showed him pantomiming eating a cooked animal carcass. In the message, Kennedy reportedly recommended the friend try eating dog while traveling in Korea. Vanity Fair reported that the photo\u2019s digital metadata shows it was taken in 2010 and that the publication consulted with a veterinarian who said the carcass in the photo appeared to be a dog\u2019s. Kennedy said the image depicted him eating a goat during a trip to South America. \u201cThe article is a lot of garbage. The picture that they said is of me eating a dog, it\u2019s actually me eating a goat in Patagonia on a whitewater trip many years ago on the Futaleufu River. They say \u2026 they have an expert that has identified that as a dog carcass. It\u2019s just not true,\u201d Kennedy said. The Vanity Fair article also features Eliza Cooney, a former part-time babysitter who worked for Kennedy between 1998 and 1999, alleging that he groped her in his kitchen. Kennedy declined to directly acknowledge the sexual assault accusation at first, instead dismissing \u201cthe other allegations\u201d as part of a \u201cvery, very rambunctious youth.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve said this from the beginning. I am not a church boy. I am not running like that. I said \u2026 I had a very, very rambunctious youth. I said in my announcement speech that I have \u2026 so many skeletons in my closet, that if they could all vote, I could run for king of the world,\u201d Kennedy said, adding, \u201cVanity Fair is recycling 30-year-old stories, and I, you know, am not gonna comment on the details of any of them.\u201d When asked directly whether he denied sexually assaulting Cooney, Kennedy repeated, \u201cI\u2019m not going to comment on it.\u201d In a social media post later Tuesday, Kennedy shared the image published by Vanity Fair of him allegedly holding a cooked dog and denied the photo depicted him eating a dog. He did not address the sexual assault allegations in the post. \u201cHey @VanityFair, you know when your veterinary experts call a goat a dog, and your forensic experts say a photo taken in Patagonia was taken in Korea, that you\u2019ve joined the ranks of supermarket tabloids,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cKeep telling America that up is down if you want. I\u2019ll keep talking about the fact that working families can\u2019t afford houses or groceries because our last two presidents went on a $14 trillion debt joyride, paid for by hard-working Americans.\u201d The accusations made in the Vanity Fair article come at a trying time for Kennedy\u2019s campaign as he seeks to expand his support across the country for his independent presidential bid. Kennedy is on the ballot in seven states but is facing opposition from Biden allies seeking to block his access in several more. Recent polls have found Kennedy in a stagnant position against Joe Biden and Donald Trump, the presumptive Democratic and Republican presidential nominees, respectively. A CNN poll released Tuesday found Kennedy earning 14% support in a multi-candidate race, behind Trump (41%) and Biden (35%). Those findings are roughly similar to a CNN poll released in November that showed Kennedy taking 16% compared with 41% for Trump and 35% for Biden. The independent candidate also faces an uphill battle in fundraising after bringing in $2.6 million to his campaign in May and spending $6.3 million as he burns through funds in his push for ballot access. Kennedy\u2019s campaign has already weathered a series of unconventional headlines. In May, Kennedy detailed a medical abnormality he experienced in 2010 that he said was caused by a parasitic worm that entered his brain and died. Kennedy said the worm caused him to experience \u201cbrain fog\u201d and trouble with \u201cword retrieval and short-term memory,\u201d but added that the issue has been resolved.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/politics/rfk-jr-eating-dog-vanity-fair/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "kfile-ed-martin-rnc-platform-committee-anti-abortion-exceptions", "text": "One of the leaders of the Republican National Convention\u2019s platform committee, which shapes the party\u2019s official stance on key issues, has a history of pushing extreme anti-abortion positions, including advocating for a national ban without exceptions for rape or incest. He also entertained the possibility of jailing women who get abortions and the doctors who perform them. Ed Martin, the deputy policy director for the convention\u2019s platform committee, is one of three people the Republican National Committee selected in May to help craft the party\u2019s platform, which serves as a blueprint for the Republican Party\u2019s agenda by detailing policy positions and how Republicans and former President Donald Trump would govern if elected. The platform is expected to be pared down this year, slashing the length of the document to focus on Trump\u2019s agenda for a second term. Martin has consistently espoused a hardline position on abortion, criticizing Republicans with a more moderate stance on the issue, and has even questioned the safety of birth control. \u201cThe true bane of the pro-life movement is the faction of fake pro-lifers who claim to believe in the sanctity of human life but are only willing to vote that way with a list of exceptions,\u201d Martin said on his radio show in June 2022 \u2013 several days after Roe v. Wade was struck down. Martin, an attorney and former chair of the Missouri Republican Party, was a staunch advocate for Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election and conspiracy theories the election was rigged against him. He is also the president of Phyllis Schlafly\u2019s Eagles \u2013 a socially conservative advocacy group named for the late activist best known for her opposition to feminism. Schlafly and Martin also co-authored the 2016 book, \u201cThe Conservative Case for Trump.\u201d CNN\u2019s KFile reviewed dozens of episodes of Martin\u2019s radio show, \u201cThe Pro America Report,\u201d from 2022 to 2024, to evaluate his anti-abortion comments. Particularly noteworthy from Martin\u2019s show, which airs on the streaming service Rumble, are his comments around the June 2022 Supreme Court ruling striking down Roe v Wade. \u201cIf the conversation is, \u2018Well, should there be a federal ban?\u2019 And the consensus is that there shouldn\u2019t \u2013 I disagree. I disagree with the consensus. I would like to see US Senators and US congressmen and women elected to office who would say, \u2018Let\u2019s ban abortion,\u2019\u201d he said in April 2024. Those views contrast with recent efforts by Trump to move away from calls for a national ban and his suggestions that the issue of abortion should be left to the states\u2014drawing the ire of anti-abortion groups. Trump has repeatedly advocated for exceptions in the case of rape, incest and health of the mother, including at Thursday\u2019s debate. \u201cYou have to follow your heart, but you have to get elected also,\u201d Trump said during the debate. Trump also said that he \u201cwill not block\u201d abortion medication if elected president. In an email to CNN, Daniella Alvarez, a spokeswoman for the RNC told CNN, \u201cThe Platform Committee has yet to convene to discuss what language should be in the final document.\u201d Martin did not respond to requests for comment. Abortion has emerged as a significant liability for Republicans. Voters have affirmed abortion rights in every state referendum since 2022 and GOP candidates across the country have softened their positions. Despite this, Martin has continued to advocate for some of the most extreme restrictions on abortion, discounting the case involving the rape of a 10-year-old girl from Ohio as a reason for exceptions, and even falsely claiming that abortions are never performed to save the life of a mother. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me to stop talking about abortion,\u201d Martin said in April 2024 on his radio show. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that because you don\u2019t think it\u2019s a winner politically, I\u2019m supposed to stop talking about abortion.\u201d During a June 2024 appearance on Trump ally Roger Stone\u2019s podcast, Martin said he\u2019s heavily involved in \u201cevery aspect\u201d of discussions around the platform, and reiterated his stance on abortion, pushing back on a report the Trump\u2019s campaign was attempting to soften the platform\u2019s position on abortion. \u201cThe platform will respect life in every moment,\u201d Martin told Stone. Punishing women and abortion doctors In May 2022, in the days after a draft opinion striking down Roe v. Wade was leaked, Martin discussed on his radio show possible prison sentences for women and abortion doctors. Martin said if anti-abortion activists accepted abortion rights advocates\u2019 framing \u2013 that it was about a woman\u2019s right \u2013 women could not be imprisoned for getting an abortion. But if the argument was reframed as being about a baby, the question whether to punish women was open. \u201cThe late Phyllis Schlafly, whom I worked so closely with, used to say, \u2018If you get to claim and frame the argument, you almost certainly get to win.\u2019 In other words, if you take their framing, it\u2019s a woman\u2019s right. Are you gonna put women in jail? No. It\u2019s about a baby. Now, what do we do? Frame the argument. Own the argument,\u201d he said. Earlier, Martin was discussing Louisiana\u2019s trigger law, which immediately banned abortion in almost all cases in the state after Roe was struck down. \u201cIf you ban abortion in Louisiana, is a doctor who has an abortion breaking the law? Yes. Should he be punished? Yes \u2013 I think that seems obvious. What is the punishment? Not sure yet. Could be criminal, could be a jail sentence, I suppose,\u201d he said. Martin also compared abortion to a family starving a child to death purposely in saying the state had an interest in some form of punishment. \u201cWhat do you do with the woman that has an abortion? I don\u2019t think we have a good answer yet. Some people say that they shouldn\u2019t be held liable in any way,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people say they should have some kind of penalty, something on their record,\u201d he said. \u201cI certainly think that you\u2019re gonna find a lot of people that step away from jail time. But if you believe it\u2019s a baby \u2013 I do \u2013 then you have to do something to protect the baby.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t just turn your back and say, \u2018Oh, well, you know what? In that family over there, I, I don\u2019t care what they do to their family, that\u2019s their family,\u2019\u201d he continued. \u201c\u2019I don\u2019t care if they take their five-year-old kid, and they, and they, let \u2018em starve to death.\u2019 No, you don\u2019t do that. You say, \u2018We have to have some laws that hold us together, and we have to be careful about it\u2019\u2026But we certainly would say in the case of starvation or life and death, there is an interest in the state to say, \u2018Hey, what are we gonna do here?\u2019\u201d Martin has said repeatedly he opposes abortion in any situation, including, as he said in July 2022, the rape of a 10-year-old Ohio girl. \u201cThis 10-year-old was brought up as an example of why abortion is necessary,\u201d Martin said. \u201cI have said over and over again the examples that shouldn\u2019t be the rule, right? You can\u2019t let the exceptions be the rule. Especially when you get engaged in debate. I refuse to do it. I refuse.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll just tell you, I think abortion\u2019s wrong. I think it\u2019s wrong because of morality. I think it\u2019s wrong because of science,\u201d he added. Opposition to abortion pills Martin has also said he opposes language in abortion bans that allows for abortion to save the life of a mother, falsely saying on his radio show in June 2022, \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute scientific fact that no abortion is ever performed to save the life of the mother. None, zero, zilch.\u201d The Supreme Court ruled last week that emergency abortions could be performed in Idaho in cases where the life of a pregnant woman is at stake, though the decision provides little clarity on the threshold for life-saving exceptions. Martin also falsely claimed multiple times that medically-induced abortion, which he referred to as a chemical abortion, and birth control pills were dangerous and \u201cdamaging,\u201d repeatedly\u00a0 criticizing the \u201cloosey goosey regulation around pill abortion\u201d and that it could be ordered via mail. Data analyzed by CNN last year found that the abortion pill mifepristone is safe \u2013 even safer than the drugs penicillin and Viagra \u2013 and a safer option than a procedural abortion or childbirth. The Supreme Court rejected a challenge to how the Food and Drug Administration regulates the abortion pill mifepristone in mid-June, allowing the pill to stay on the market and ship to patients without an in-person doctor\u2019s visit. RNC platform Martin is one of three leaders now shaping the GOP platform \u2013 along with Russ Vought, the influential former White House Office of Management and Budget director in the Trump administration, and Randy Evans, a former US ambassador to Luxembourg during the Trump administration. The RNC\u2019s platform typically details the party\u2019s stance on important topics such as abortion, marriage, policing, the Federal Reserve, technology, and energy. It is created by a committee that includes one male and one female representative from each US state and territory, who vote to adopt the platform at the convention. The party\u2019s platform is typically debated and fought over behind-the-scenes by party leaders. In 2016, the platform notably weakened its position on providing aid and weapons to Ukraine amidst Russian incursion, prompting the special counsel Robert Mueller one year later to investigate whether Trump himself had influenced the decision. The Mueller report found no evidence that Trump ordered or was even aware of the platform changes. In 2020, the RNC chose not to adopt a new platform because of logistics and the coronavirus pandemic.", "source": "http://cnn.com/kfile-ed-martin-rnc-platform-committee-anti-abortion-exceptions/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_politics_immunity-case-donald-trump-scotus", "text": "The biggest question now that the Supreme Court has decided Donald Trump is entitled to some immunity from prosecution: What happens next in special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election interference case against the former president? Assuming Smith stays the course, written arguments and even proceedings with witness testimony and evidence are likely to be next before US District Judge Tanya Chutkan in Washington, DC. The special counsel\u2019s office has not responded yet publicly to the decision, and there is nothing at the moment on Chutkan\u2019s docket indicating what next steps will be taken in the trial court. Those are likely to come in the days after the Supreme Court hands the opinion down formally to the federal courts in DC. The mechanism for sending a case back down usually takes as a long as a month, but the high court could act more quickly \u2013 particularly if a party asks it to. Once Chutkan works through the legal issues, it\u2019s possible that more appeals could put the case on hold again. This is why it may be unlikely for Trump to go to trial this year, if at all. But courts can be hard to predict. What Trump is and isn\u2019t immune for The Supreme Court put one set of allegations against Trump \u2013 regarding his and his allies\u2019 efforts to weaponize the Justice Department \u2013 in the bucket of absolute immunity. For the several other categories of allegations, Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 majority opinion said that the lower courts will have to go through a process of \u201cfact-specific\u201d and perhaps \u201cchallenging\u201d analysis. The Supreme Court said that\u00a0that Trump\u2019s pressure campaign on Vice President Mike Pence to help him overturn the election is \u201cpresumptively\u201d immune, and put the burden on the prosecutors to rebut the presumptive immunity. As for Trump\u2019s state-level efforts to overturn the results, including the fake electors scheme, the high court told lower courts to analyze what of that conduct was an official act and what was not. Roberts said that analysis will require an \u201cassessment of numerous alleged interactions with a wide variety of state officials and private persons.\u201d The lower courts will also have to parse what conduct was an official presidential act when it comes to Trump\u2019s January 6-related behavior and his comments that egged on the Capitol riot. Roberts said the lower courts may need to look \u201cwhat else was said contemporaneous to the excerpted communications, or who was involved in transmitting the electronic communications and in organizing the rally\u201d in deciding which of those communications are immunized. If Chutkan does rule on on what is an official act and what is not, it\u2019s possible that Trump would appeal those rulings to the DC Circuit court and ultimately to the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling strongly suggests that those appeals would need to be resolved pre-trial, making it unlikely this case goes to a jury before Americans cast their ballots for president. Jack Smith\u2019s options going forward It\u2019s also possible that Smith\u2019s office winnows down his case to bring it in line with the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion. That could mean cutting out some parts of what they want to present to the jury, or even refiling the indictment against Trump so it doesn\u2019t allege violations related to the official work of the presidency. The special counsel\u2019s office will also have to grapple with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to cut out any evidence from that case that would be official actions of the President \u2013 throwing another wrench in how the case will be prosecuted. Still, with Chutkan, the timeline could move quickly \u2013 potentially as quickly as a few weeks for briefing and hearings.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/politics/immunity-case-donald-trump-scotus/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_fact-check-donald-trump-sea-levels-climate-change", "text": "The day after their CNN presidential debate, former President Donald Trump cited a wildly inaccurate figure about sea levels to mock President Joe Biden\u2019s debate\u00a0claim that\u00a0\u201cthe only existential threat to humanity is climate change.\u201d Trump\u00a0said\u00a0at a Friday rally in Virginia that \u201cglobal warming is fine,\u201d rejecting the view of the overwhelming majority of scientists. And he said of Biden: \u201cHe said it again last night, that global warming is an existential threat. And I say that the thing that\u2019s an existential threat is not global warming, where the ocean will rise \u2013 maybe, it may go down, also \u2013 but it may rise one eighth of an inch in the next 497 years, they say. One eighth.\u201d He added what appeared to be a joke: \u201cWhich gives you a little bit more waterfront property if you\u2019re lucky\u00a0enough though.\u201d Facts\u00a0First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s\u00a0claim about the expected pace of\u00a0sea level\u00a0rise is\u00a0not even close to correct. The global average\u00a0sea level\u00a0is\u00a0currently risi\ufeffng\u00a0more\u00a0per year\u00a0than Trump claimed that people\u00a0say it will rise \u201cin the next 497 years.\u201d NASA\u00a0reported\u00a0in March that the current global average\u00a0sea level\u00a0rise in 2023 was 0.17 inches\u00a0per year, more than double the rate in 1993. And a World Meteorological Organization\u00a0report this\u00a0year\u00a0said the rate of\u00a0sea level\u00a0rise between 2014 and 2023 was\u00a0about 0.19 inches\u00a0per year. In other words,\u00a0sea level\u00a0rise is\u00a0already more than an eighth of an inch annually \u2013 and it is\u00a0accelerating. NASA\u00a0found\u00a0a jump of 0.3 inches\u00a0between 2022 and 2023. Gary Griggs, a University of California,\u00a0Santa Cruz professor of earth and planetary\u00a0sciences\u00a0who\u00a0studies\u00a0sea level\u00a0rise,\u00a0said\u00a0last year that Trump\u2019s\u00a0similar claims\u00a0\u201ccan only be described as\u00a0totally out of touch with reality\u201d and that Trump \u201chas\u00a0no idea what he is\u00a0talking about.\u201d Sea levels\u00a0rise by different amounts\u00a0in\u00a0different locations. For the US,\u00a0sea levels\u00a0are\u00a0expected to rise particularly fast\u00a0for the east coast and Gulf of Mexico coast \u2013 and Trump\u2019s\u00a0state of Florida, which is\u00a0bordered by both of those coasts, is\u00a0expected to be\u00a0affected more\u00a0severely\u00a0than many other coastal\u00a0states. In fact, Trump\u2019s\u00a0claims\u00a0about\u00a0sea levels\u00a0are highly inaccurate for the area near Mar-a-Lago, which is\u00a0on the Atlantic. Griggs\u00a0noted in a June email that\u00a0data\u00a0from the closest National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration tide gauge to Mar-a-Lago\u00a0shows\u00a0an increase of an eighth of an inch\u00a0roughly\u00a0every\u00a0nine months. Trump has\u00a0made similar claims\u00a0since his last presidential campaign - sometimes saying the estimate is an eighth of an inch increase over 200, 250, 300 or 400 years. Trump has also\u00a0previously\u00a0made the joke about rising seas creating more waterfront property.\u00a0In reality, rising sea levels are expected to have devastating consequences not only for many seafront properties but for areas further inland \u2013\u00a0rendering some communities uninhabitable\u00a0and others more dangerous, increasing the frequency and reach of\u00a0flooding, making hurricanes\u00a0more destructive, and damaging\u00a0infrastructure\u00a0and ecosystems.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/politics/fact-check-donald-trump-sea-levels-climate-change/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_politics_democrats-biden-congress-what-matters", "text": "Democrats\u2019 collective freakout over the fitness of President Joe Biden hinges first and foremost on his ability to beat former President Donald Trump. But in the distressed comments of lawmakers and strategists lurks the additional fact that the House and Senate are also up for grabs in November \u2013 and if voters turn on Biden, it could reverberate across the country and hand Republicans unified control of the federal government. Damage control measures from the White House and Biden campaign are coming In an effort to prove Biden can still think on his feet, he\u2019ll meet the press and interact with lawmakers \u2013 things, shockingly, he has not already done in the wake of last week\u2019s debate. There are plans for a meeting with nervous Democratic governors this week; an interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC News, with clips to be aired at the end of the week; and a Biden-hosted press conference during next week\u2019s NATO summit. Lawmaker calls on president to drop out with nod to Biden drag The first evidence of actual fracture among Democrats is already here. It appeared on Tuesday when Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a longtime Democratic congressman from Texas, became the first elected Democrat at the national level to reluctantly call on Biden to withdraw from the presidential race. Doggett appealed to Biden\u2019s sense of patriotism in a statement and noted that Biden is underperforming Democratic candidates for Senate in key states around the country. Incumbent presidents are supposed leave coattails for down-ballot candidates to ride in their wake. For Democrats this year, even before Biden\u2019s bad debate performance, the opposite was true. Biden may be a drag on Democrats\u2019 already long prospects to keep the Senate. Senate majority is at risk With a 51-49 majority, Democrats (including independents who caucus with them) have a tenuous hold on power in the Senate and are on defense in multiple consequential races. Twenty-three seats currently held by Democrats are on the line in November compared with 11 held by Republicans. One Democratic seat, currently held by Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia \u2013 who is not running for reelection and left the Democratic Party to register as an independent \u2013 is likely to move to the Republican column. Implications for decades Rep. Mike Quigley, a Democrat from Illinois, did not call on Biden to withdraw from the race, but he did point out that the president\u2019s decision on whether to continue his campaign will have implications that extend well beyond the presidency and his own personal legacy. \u201cHis decision not only impacts who\u2019s going to serve in the White House the next four years but who\u2019s going to serve in the Senate, who\u2019s going to serve in the House, and it will have implications for decades to come,\u201d Quigley said. In the House, Democrats could be within striking distance of a majority since Republicans currently hold only a slight 219-213 majority. \u2018Team sport,\u2019 and Biden needs help Biden\u2019s old boss, former President Barack Obama, appeared at a New York City fundraiser last Friday alongside Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the New Yorker and top Democrat in the House who Democrats would very much like to be speaker. Obama said general elections are like a \u201cteam sport\u201d and the president is captain, according to CNN\u2019s report, but in this case voters should be motivated by down-ballot races. \u201cWe need the White House, because of the enormous power of the executive branch,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut the critical need for us to regain the House and have Hakeem Jeffries as speaker should be sufficient motivation. And if we do our jobs on that front, that is probably the most important thing we can do for the Biden reelection campaign as well.\u201d The not-so-subtle implication there is that Biden will need to be propped up by other Democrats in order to win. Fearing a \u2018MAGA trifecta\u2019 The Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator Paul Begala predicted on Monday on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Lead\u201d that pressure on Biden is only just beginning since lawmakers are headed home to talk to their constituents over the July Fourth holiday. \u201cI think voters are going to say, are you out of your mind? Because Democrats are worried that not only will Biden lose to Trump, but that he\u2019ll drag down the House and the Senate as well. And you\u2019ll have a MAGA trifecta \u2013 which Mr. Trump himself says will be a dictatorship, at least for a day,\u201d Begala told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. Presidents are more productive in periods of unified government Recent presidents have made their most lasting marks during periods of unified government, usually at the outset of their presidencies. It was when Democrats controlled the House, Senate and White House during his first two years in office that Biden signed the massive Inflation Reduction Act, the bipartisan infrastructure law, the PACT Act to improve care for veterans and more. It was when Republicans controlled the House, Senate and White House during his first two years in office that Trump signed some permanent corporate tax cuts into law. The Affordable Care Act under Obama? Unified government. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, which turns 60 years old on Tuesday? Unified government. Granted, neither party is likely to have a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate to easily pass major and sweeping legislation. But certainly controlling the elected portions of the federal government creates an environment for productivity. There has been lots of reporting about how Trump and his supporters will be better prepared to change the nature of government if they are to win in November. With the House and Senate, they could make more priorities permanent. \u2018Just sit there and be Joe\u2019 Even party stalwarts on the level of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose main goal for decades has been winning and keeping the House, said Biden must prove to Democrats and voters that he is still up to the job. She recommended he give a series of interviews or town halls. \u201cJust sit there and be Joe,\u201d Pelosi said during an interview on MSNBC on Tuesday. \u201cShow your values, show your knowledge, show your judgment.\u201d But Pelosi also said of Biden\u2019s debate performance that it is a \u201clegitimate question to say, is this an episode, or is this a condition.\u201d While she quickly added that this was a legitimate question for Trump as well, citing his repeated lies during the debate, that\u2019s far from an unqualified endorsement of his ability to be president \u2013 and she said both Trump and Biden could stand to take a cognitive test of some kind. \u201cBoth candidates owe whatever test you want to put them to, in terms of their mental acuity and their health \u2013 both of them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/politics/democrats-biden-congress-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_politics_steve-bannon-report-to-prison", "text": "Steve Bannon, a former Donald Trump White House strategist, reported to a federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut, on Monday to begin a four-month sentence for defying a congressional subpoena. Bannon, the second former Trump aide to be imprisoned for a contempt of Congress conviction after Peter Navarro began serving a four-month sentence earlier this year, was taken into custody shortly after 12 p.m. ET. He was driven into the federal prison in a black van after speaking at a podium outside the correctional facility, saying he was \u201cproud\u201d to go to prison. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to surrender up in Danbury,\u201d he said. Both Bannon and Navarro were convicted for not complying with subpoenas issued to them by the now-defunct House Select Committee that investigated January 6, 2021. The Supreme Court on Friday denied a long-shot effort by Bannon to avoid reporting to prison while he challenges his conviction before the federal appeals court in Washington, DC. Bannon has said that he was not thumbing his nose at the House committee but rather relying on advice from his attorneys to not respond to the subpoena until lawmakers worked out Trump\u2019s claims of executive privilege in the matter. Courts did not allow him to argue that to the jury that decided his case. The conservative podcaster has remained a staunch Trump ally and is a vocal supporter of his presidential reelection bid. In an interview aired Monday morning, the former president reacted to Bannon reporting to prison, saying, \u201c(President Joe) Biden is going to pay a big price for it.\u201d \u201cThey wanted to silence him, but they\u2019ll never silence him, but they wanted to silence him. Oh, this is pure weaponization. What they\u2019ve done in this country is unthinkable, and Biden is going to pay a big price for it, I believe. Because I think that people are going to say, well, wow, you\u2019ve opened up a Pandora\u2019s Box. It\u2019s a terrible thing that they\u2019ve opened up. They\u2019ve unleashed this. This is the third world countries. No, they wanted to silence Steve Bannon, and the only the way they could do it was by putting him in jail,\u201d Trump said in an interview with \u201cRichmond\u2019s Morning News with John Reid.\u201d \u2018More powerful in prison\u2019 The MAGA media firebrand was keeping a busy schedule in the days before his prison sentence. He tried, unsuccessfully, to convince Trump to skip the CNN presidential debate last week. He continued to host his far-right podcast where he has vowed to get revenge on his political enemies and imprison the current leadership of the Justice Department. And he welcomed several mainstream media reporters to join him during his broadcasts, all while peddling his narrative of political martyrdom. \u201cI\u2019m going to be more powerful in prison than I am now,\u201d Bannon said last week. His public persona has been one of indifference \u2014 unbothered and unafraid of his time at the federal facility. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be sitting there going, \u2018Oh, woe is me,\u2019\u201d Bannon told CNN. Sources close to Bannon painted a different picture, describing a man vacillating between denial that he would be spared a prison term and apprehension about what life behind bars would entail. Limited contact with the outside world For criminal defendants, there are worse prisons to end up in than the facility where Bannon will spend the next four months. Danbury has a relatively small prison population, with fewer than 1,200 male and female inmates. The low-security facility where Bannon will be housed is populated with white-collar criminals, though it can also include some violent offenders and sex offenders. The commissary offers various snacks from peanut butter to plantain chips, according to an online list. But Bannon\u2019s universe is about to shrink. Inmates don\u2019t have access to the Internet, according to people familiar with the prison. Those in custody at Danbury can send emails without attachments, but they pass through a monitored system, on a delay. The Federal Bureau of Prisons code bars inmates from conducting a business while incarcerated. In addition to email access, inmates at Danbury receive hundreds of phone minutes per month, which they can use in 15-minute increments on a wall-mounted phone. Once the monthly minutes are exhausted, there\u2019s no option to reup them. It\u2019s a far cry from broadcasting to the Trump faithful for hours each day. Still, Bannon insisted his \u201cWar Room\u201d media platform would thrive even in his absence. \u201cWe\u2019re a populist movement. This is all about the audience,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cWhether I never come back ever to the \u2018War Room\u2019 won\u2019t make a difference.\u201d He had lofty expectations that he, too, would thrive in the coming months. \u201cI\u2019m working 24/7 on this campaign,\u201d said Bannon, who does not have a formal role in Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign but has remained one of the former president\u2019s most strident supporters, even after he was fired from the Trump White House. \u201cI will have a much bigger impact on the campaign when I\u2019m in prison than I have now,\u201d he said. For now, though, Bannon is poised to go through an intake process on Monday that\u2019s familiar to inmates at Danbury. He\u2019ll pass through a metal detector and undergo a strip search. Afterward, he\u2019ll take part in a mental health evaluation. He\u2019ll then be taken to his housing unit, provided with a bedroll, assigned to a bed and left to acclimate to life behind bars. That life won\u2019t include clinging to letters from his fans, Bannon said. \u201cYou must focus 100% of your time on winning,\u201d he said of those who might be inspired to send notes of support to his cell. \u201cDon\u2019t send me a letter, because I\u2019m not going to read it,\u201d he added.

Lloyd Doggett of Texas on Tuesday became the first sitting Democratic member of Congress to call on President Joe Biden to withdraw from the presidential race, a huge moment for the Democratic Party as Doggett says publicly what many elected officials had been speculating about privately. \u201cI represent the heart of a congressional district once represented by Lyndon Johnson.\u00a0Under very different circumstances, he made the painful decision to withdraw,\u201d Doggett said in his statement. \u201cPresident Biden should do the same.\u201d Doggett\u2019s statement magnifies the pressure surrounding the president and his team, who have been trying to tamp down party concerns in the wake of Biden\u2019s disappointing debate performance against former President Donald Trump last week, and Doggett\u2019s comments could embolden others to follow suit. In calling on Biden to step aside, Doggett said the president could help usher in a new generation of leadership to help the party achieve its ultimate goal: defeating Trump. \u201cRecognizing that, unlike Trump, President Biden\u2019s first commitment has always been to our country, not himself, I am hopeful that he will make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw,\u201d Doggett said. \u201cI respectfully call on him to do so.\u201d Earlier on Tuesday, Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley of Illinois had signaled an openness to replace Biden as the party\u2019s presidential nominee. \u201cI think his four years are one of the great presidencies of our lifetime, but I think he has to be honest with himself,\u201d Quigley told Kasie Hunt on CNN \u201cThis Morning.\u201d \u201cThis is a decision he\u2019s going to have to make.\u201d \u201cWe have to be honest with ourselves that it wasn\u2019t just a horrible night, but I won\u2019t go beyond that out of my respect and understanding of President Joe Biden, a very proud person who has served us extraordinarily well for 50 years,\u201d he added. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a strong Biden ally, said on MSNBC that the president should be participating in multiple interviews as people evaluate him. \u201cI think it\u2019s essential for them to do that,\u201d Pelosi told MSNBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell on Tuesday. The former speaker,\u00a0who emphasized it is Biden\u2019s decision\u00a0about whether to step aside,\u00a0said that she has heard \u201cmixed\u201d responses to the debate from donors and other people in her Democratic network. \u201cI\u00a0think\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0a\u00a0legitimate\u00a0question\u00a0to\u00a0say,\u00a0is\u00a0this\u00a0an\u00a0episode\u00a0or\u00a0is\u00a0this\u00a0a\u00a0condition,\u201d Pelosi said,\u00a0though she added that the\u00a0same should be asked of Trump, citing his\u00a0repeated lies\u00a0during the debate.

Jim\u00a0Clyburn of South Carolina, a crucial ally for Biden,\u00a0said on MSNBC he still supports Biden at the top of the ticket but\u00a0added that he would support Vice President Kamala Harris if Biden were to withdraw as the Democratic presidential nominee. \u201cI will support her if he were to step aside,\u201d Clyburn\u00a0said when asked what he would do if Biden withdraws, later adding, \u201cThis party should not in any way do anything to work around Miss Harris.\u201d However, Clyburn\u00a0reaffirmed his support for Biden. \u201cI want this ticket to continue to be Biden-Harris and then we will see what happens after the next election,\u201d he said. Even more Democrats have been expressing their concerns behind the scenes. While the Biden campaign and White House have maintained that the president is staying in the race and have chalked up Biden\u2019s debate performance to a bad night that doesn\u2019t overshadow his accomplishments, lawmakers from across the party have been reaching out to share their anxieties about Biden remaining at the top of the ticket. A House Democratic lawmaker told CNN that, \u201cThere\u2019s a large and increasing group of House Democrats concerned about the president\u2019s candidacy, representing a broad swath of the caucus. We are deeply concerned about his trajectory and his ability to win. We want to give him space to make a decision [to step aside] but we will be increasingly vocal about our concerns if he doesn\u2019t.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.

{"id": "2024_07_01_politics_biden-campaign-reelection-debate", "text": "President Joe Biden waged an intense weekend battle to save his reelection bid following\u00a0his disastrous debate performance\u00a0but has been unable to dismiss existential questions about his candidacy that are more glaring than ever. Biden is secluded with his family at Camp David following several events at which he tried to ease panic among Democratic voters, officials and donors after the debate multiplied concerns that he\u2019s too old to beat former President Donald Trump or to serve a second term. His weak and incoherent demeanor during Thursday night\u2019s event on CNN created an extraordinary twist in the campaign and left him facing calls to cede the stage to a younger candidate just over four months from Election Day. Biden\u2019s allies spent the weekend lashing out at critics in the media calling for him to step aside and insisting that early data showed that Biden\u2019s calamitous showing had not altered the fundamental shape of the race. Democratic Party grandees, meanwhile, crowded onto Sunday talk shows to try to put the spotlight back on Trump. \u201cLet us not make a judgment about a presidency on one debate,\u201d former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s talk about what it means to people in their lives \u2026 the difference between Joe Biden and the former president is so clear.\u201d South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, a longtime Biden supporter, admitted to Bash that his friend had a \u201cbad\u201d debate but put the blame on Biden being overloaded with facts by staffers. The president\u2019s family, who would be critical in any decisions on the campaign\u2019s future, currently believes Biden should stay in the race and keep fighting as they await polling data while braced for some erosion of his position, CNN\u2019s MJ Lee and Jeff Zeleny reported Sunday. Still, that view could shift if there is a downward spiral, and the president were to be convinced that leaving the race would be the best decision. One of the president\u2019s confidants, Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, said on \u201cCNN This Morning\u201d on Monday that Biden\u2019s blank, open-mouthed stares during the debate reflected\u00a0\u201ca president who is frankly thunderstruck by just how aggressively Donald Trump is lying about everything.\u201d \u201cI think everyone\u2019s entitled to have a bad night,\u201d Coons told Kasie Hunt, but added that Biden now needs to demonstrate \u201cmore unscripted and off the record moments.\u201d However, the Democratic damage control strategy of arguing that one bad night does not detract from Biden\u2019s past successes ignores the critical question with which many voters have wrestled for months: Is Biden simply too physically and cognitively diminished to serve another four years? Republicans are doubling down on the issue. \u201cAll of America saw it. And you know who else saw it? Our adversaries saw it. Putin saw it, Xi saw it, the Ayatollah saw it,\u201d North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a potential Trump vice presidential pick said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d referring to the leaders of Russia, China and Iran. Top Democrats publicly back Biden There\u2019s so far no sign that the 81-year-old president is contemplating abandoning his campaign to make way for\u00a0a hurried attempt by the party\u00a0to find another candidate. \u201cJoe Biden is not going to take himself out of this race, nor should he,\u201d Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d Since Biden is the presumptive nominee after dominating Democratic primaries, there\u2019s no realistic way for the party to move on unless the president decides it\u2019s time. Some party leaders fear a new nominating contest at this point would run the risk of setting off an internal civil war that could effectively hand Trump the presidency. Biden has meanwhile repeatedly insisted he\u2019s fit to serve. And any rising-star Democrat who did step up would be accused of betrayal by many in the party and would risk their own future careers. The president said at a fundraising event in New Jersey on Saturday night that he understood the concern, admitting he \u201cdidn\u2019t have a great night\u201d in Atlanta and walks more slowly and talks less smoothly than he used to. But he vowed to fight on. For now, Biden\u2019s team appears to have staved off the immediate danger to his campaign. His fundraising is still robust with more than $33 million raised in the days following the debate, according to his team. The heavy hitters willing to go on TV to defend him showed he\u2019s not yet lost his party \u2014 even if there\u2019s a full-grade meltdown going on behind the scenes. But any set of bad polls showing an already-tough reelection bid was seriously damaged by the debate could trigger panic again. And no modern president or presumptive nominee has faced anything comparable to the calls from usually-friendly media commentators who are now urging Biden to announce he won\u2019t accept the Democratic nomination in Chicago in August. CNN reported on Saturday that Democratic donors are split over whether to stick with Biden or to seek another nominee, however complicated that might be. Any sign that the president could also take down Democratic hopes of holding the Senate and winning back the House could bolster the case of those wanting change, especially after a week in which the Supreme Court has demonstrated just how fundamentally unchecked conservative rule can reshape the nation. The top bench is due to rule Monday on Trump\u2019s claim that he enjoyed immunity for actions as president \u2014 in a case that points to his belief that he will have almost unlimited powers if he wins a second term. Biden has put claims that Trump would destroy democracy at the center of his reelection bid, but his debate debacle is only raising fresh questions about whether the threat is so grave that Democrats should turn to a safer bet. One hint of a movement against Biden While top party figures are publicly standing with Biden \u2014 to do anything else would be seen as treachery \u2014 many Democrats were deeply shaken by Thursday night\u2019s debate. Many people in the party spent the weekend bemoaning the situation privately, several sources said, and are now viewing November\u2019s election with dread. Only one senior figure, however, has as much as hinted at movement against Biden behind the scenes. Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin told MSNBC the party was having \u201ca very serious conversation about what to do.\u201d Raskin added: \u201cRegardless of what President Biden decides, our party is going to be unified, and our party also needs him at the very center of our deliberations in our campaign.\u201d Raskin continued, \u201cWhether (Biden) is a candidate or someone else is the candidate, he is going to be the keynote speaker at our convention.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign sent out a stream of memos, fundraising appeals and statements over the weekend, insisting he would not quit. \u201cJoe Biden is going to be the Democratic nominee, period. End of story,\u201d the campaign wrote to supporters in one email. \u201cVoters voted. He won overwhelmingly. And if he were to drop out, it would lead to weeks of chaos, internal food fighting, and a bunch of candidates who limp into a brutal floor fight at the convention, all while Donald Trump has time to speak to American voters uncontested.\u201d Yet Biden\u2019s performance was so poor on Thursday night that he allowed Trump plenty of time to speak to voters uncontested, as the ex-president got away with a torrent of lies. Often, Biden missed chances to hammer Trump on key Democratic issues such as abortion, and turned the focus back to his own vulnerabilities, such as immigration. The ferocious counterattack by Biden\u2019s campaign, however, is not answering fundamental questions posed in the aftermath of a debate that shattered confidence in Biden\u2019s capacity to beat Trump for many of his fellow Democrats. The president was under extreme pressure heading into the showdown because polls have long shown majorities of voters believe he is too old to serve a second term that would end when he is 86. Biden has noticeably become more fragile in recent years and appears a much-changed figure even from when he took office in 2021. But instead of putting such fears to rest, he exacerbated them at a pivotal moment in the campaign with over 50 million viewers watching. And while Biden bounced back with a strong performance at a scripted campaign event in North Carolina on Friday, it will be impossible to erase the painful picture of a president falling prey to the ravages of time in his televised clash with Trump. Voters saw Biden\u2019s reduced and poignant state with their own eyes. New poll shows growing concern over Biden\u2019s age Biden\u2019s campaign has long denied that the president\u2019s age is disqualifying, even though it\u2019s one of the first issues voters raise outside of the Washington political bubble. Efforts to shield Biden from public scrutiny now risk coming across as an attempt to hide his true condition from the public. The debate has shattered the credibility of frequent attempts by those around Biden to argue that while he\u2019s often shaky in public, behind closed doors he is a dynamic force who runs intellectual rings around young aides. Biden campaign manager Jennifer O\u2019Malley Dillon even blamed any poor forthcoming polls on the media and not the president. \u201cIf we do see changes in polling in the coming weeks, it will not be the first time that overblown media narratives have driven temporary dips in the polls,\u201d she wrote, referring to former President Barack Obama\u2019s numbers after he lost his first debate to Utah Sen. Mitt Romney in 2012. The comparison is inexact, however. Obama did perform very poorly and pitched his campaign into crisis. But there was never any question that he was not physically or mentally fit to serve another four years as president. A new CBS/YouGov poll\u00a0conducted after the debate found that 72% of registered voters now believe that Biden does not have the mental and cognitive health to serve as president. That\u2019s seven points higher than weeks before the debate. Only 28% of voters said Biden should be running for president. Some 46% of Democratic registered voters thought he should not be. On the one hand, these are devastating figures for a president who has seen erosion in key aspects of his coalition \u2014 among young, progressive and minority voters especially and has an increasingly narrow path through battleground states. But if there\u2019s one silver lining for Biden, it\u2019s that voters have long thought he\u2019s too old to run and he\u2019s been closely matched with Trump in national polls, raising the possibility that the twice impeached convicted felon alienates so many voters that the president may still be seen as a better choice by many. Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty raised this point in a pep talk email to Biden supporters, noting that \u201cpeople were reminded of what they hate about Donald Trump: that he\u2019s unhinged, out for revenge, and in it for himself.\u201d Flaherty also took remarkable swipes at the \u201cbed wetting brigade\u201d of Democrats calling on Biden to drop out and suggested voters didn\u2019t care about cable news analysis or \u201cself-important Podcasters,\u201d an apparent reference to former Obama aides on the \u201cPod Save America\u201d podcast who were withering in their criticism.

The 12 signatories tendered their resignations at various points over the course of the nearly nine-month conflict between Israel and Hamas, with one resigning as recently as Tuesday. Many of them have spoken out, including to CNN, about their decisions to publicly leave in protest of the administration\u2019s policies. As\u00a0CNN reported\u00a0last month, the officials had begun banding together to put pressure on the government to change course. Tuesday\u2019s statement was released in conjunction with the July Fourth holiday, noting that \u201cas our nation celebrates its Independence Day, each of us are reminded that we resigned from government not to terminate that oath but to continue to abide by it; not to end our commitment to service, but to extend it.\u201d \u201cThe Administration\u2019s policy in Gaza is a failure and a threat to U.S. national security,\u201d they write in the joint statement, titled \u201cService in Dissent.\u201d \u201cAmerica\u2019s diplomatic cover for, and continuous flow of arms to, Israel has ensured our undeniable complicity in the killings and forced starvation of a besieged Palestinian population in Gaza. This is not only morally reprehensible and in clear violation of international humanitarian law and U.S. laws, but it has also put a target on America\u2019s back,\u201d they continue, arguing that it has put the lives of service members and diplomats at risk. President Joe Biden has faced pressure both abroad and at home over his\u00a0support for Israel\u00a0in its war in Gaza\u00a0\u2013 a\u00a0conflict\u00a0that has cost tens of thousands of civilian lives, displaced millions and brought extreme hunger throughout the enclave. Although the rhetoric from the administration has become harsher \u2013 with warnings that Israel must do more to protect civilians and allow more aid in \u2013 the policies have remained largely unchanged. The resigned officials argue that the US policy toward Gaza has \u201cbeen deeply damaging not only for U.S relations in the region, but for our global credibility, the credibility of U.S. values, and the credibility of the West \u2014 a particularly perilous state of affairs in the context of this era of strategic competition.\u201d The joint statement lays out six recommendations to the US government. Among them are a call for the US government to \u201cfaithfully execute the law,\u201d saying that \u201cit is abundantly clear that the Administration is currently willfully violating multiple U.S. laws and attempting to deny or distort facts, use loopholes, or manipulate processes to ensure a continuous flow of lethal weapons to Israel.\u201d It also calls for the government to use \u201call necessary and available leverage to bring the conflict to an immediate close\u201d; expansion of humanitarian aid; support of the self-determination of the Palestinian people; stronger oversight and accountability mechanisms within the executive branch; and support of freedom of speech for college protesters. Resigned officials who previously spoke with CNN said many of their former colleagues felt similarly to them but were not in a position to resign. The joint statement concludes with a message to such colleagues, telling them that their \u201cvoice matters.\u201d \u201cWe encourage you to keep pushing. In our experience, no decision point is too minor to challenge, so while you are in government service, use your voice, write letters to leaders in your agencies, and bring up your disagreements with your team,\u201d they continue. \u201cSpeaking out has a snowball effect, inspiring others to use their voice.

{"id": "2024_07_02_politics_democratic-governors-joe-biden", "text": "Some Democratic governors are seeking a meeting with the White House to discuss their concerns about President Joe Biden in the aftermath of his poor debate performance, multiple sources with knowledge of the discussions told CNN. The concern from some of the nation\u2019s Democratic governors were aired on a call Monday organized by Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, one of the sources said. The call was attended by governors only. On the call,\u00a0some of\u00a0the governors expressed surprise that they had not heard from Biden himself\u00a0about his debate performance. There was a strong sentiment on the call that they needed to hear from Biden directly\u00a0on the matter. There was also some discussion of having Vice President Kamala Harris address them. The governors, one of the sources said, were worried about going public with their concerns out of fear that it would lead to Biden digging in further. Plans for the meeting at the White House are underway but it has not been scheduled. The White House is eyeing a meeting with Democratic governors on Wednesday, a source familiar with the matter says. The meeting at the White House would likely include a mix of in-person and virtual attendance, the source said. Biden\u2019s advisers are also discussing the possibility of having the president travel to Wisconsin on Friday and Pennsylvania on Sunday, the source said. Biden\u2019s shaky debate performance last Thursday roiled some of his largest donors and sent Democrats\u00a0into\u00a0a panic about the future of his campaign. Biden has appeared in several public events since the debate, including a series of fundraisers, a post-debate rally in North Carolina on Friday and a\u00a0brief speech on Monday evening about\u00a0the Supreme Court\u2019s immunity decision. During each of these events, he has appeared more energetic and clear-spoken than he was during\u00a0the debate. During his animated rally in North Carolina on Friday, Biden conceded he performed poorly during the debate. \u201cI know I\u2019m not a young man,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t walk as easily as I used to. I don\u2019t talk as smoothly as I used to. I don\u2019t debate as well as I used to, but I know what I do know: I know how to tell the truth. I know right from wrong.\u201d But Biden\u2019s recent appearances have all either been in front of a friendly crowd or featured the president reading from a teleprompter. He has ignored most reporters\u2019 shouted questions since Thursday. And while Biden aides and top campaign advisers have raced to soothe anxieties about the president\u2019s political future, lawmakers and other top Democrats clearly want to hear from the president himself. Hoping to ease anxieties, Biden\u2019s campaign chair on Monday told a group of donors that his team was \u201cclear-eyed\u201d about the realities of his debate showing. But participants in the Zoom call said Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon batted away questions about Biden\u2019s age and whether he could fulfill the duties of his of his office, and dismissed questions about whether he should be replaced on the ticket. The campaign\u2019s dismissiveness has caused some top Democrats to balk at the way post-debate messaging has been handled by Biden\u2019s team. This story has been updated with additional reporting. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect that some of the governors on the call had not heard from the president directly about the debate.

{"id": "2024_07_01_politics_joe-biden-immunity-supreme-court", "text": "President Joe Biden on Monday condemned the Supreme Court\u2019s decision which ruled that presidents have an absolute immunity from prosecution for core official acts, and issued a stern warning over a possible second term for former President Donald Trump. \u201cThere are no kings in America. Each, each of us is equal before the law. No one, no one is above the law, not even the president of the United States,\u201d Biden said in a speech from the White House. \u201c(With) today\u2019s Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity, that fundamentally changed. For all practical purposes, there are virtually no limits on what the president can do. It\u2019s a fundamentally new principle and it\u2019s a dangerous precedent because the power of the office will no longer be constrained by the law even including the supreme court of the United States.\u201d The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision along ideological lines,\u00a0ruled\u00a0that Trump may claim immunity from criminal prosecution for some of the actions he took as president before leaving office, likely delaying his federal election subversion trial related to his actions on January 6 even further. The\u00a0ruling\u00a0rejects a decision from a federal appeals court in February that found the former president enjoyed no immunity for alleged crimes he committed during his presidency to reverse the 2020 election results. Biden repeatedly warned that the limits of the president\u2019s power now solely rest with the holder of the office and the choices that person makes. He said Trump would be a danger in that role. The notably political speech comes at a critical moment for Biden\u2019s campaign as he tries to beat back persistent concerns about his age exacerbated by his performance in last week\u2019s presidential debate. His unsteady performance wreaked anxiety among some of his top donors and raised uncomfortable questions for Democrats about whether he should remain on their ticket, much less serve another four years in the White House. During Monday\u2019s speech, Biden appeared alert, reading energetically from a teleprompter in the Cross Hall of the White House. But he did not take questions, immediately walking away after his five-minute, scripted statement. On Monday, Biden referenced the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol and called it \u201cone of the darkest days in the history of America.\u201d He said the court\u2019s decision has made it unlikely that Trump will face trial for his criminal charges related to that riot before the election. The court\u2019s decision technically allows special counsel Jack Smith to move forward with his election subversion case against Trump, but left many technical questions unresolved \u2013 making it increasingly unlikely that a trial can get underway before the November election. Smith\u2019s case now returns to lower courts, which must review the specific steps Trump took to overturn the results of the 2020 election and whether those actions were official, and therefore receive immunity, or private, and do not. The majority said that Trump\u2019s conversations with the Justice Department \u2013 his efforts to try to get officials on board with his attempt to overturn the election \u2013 were covered with absolute immunity. For other official actions and more routine powers held by the president, the court said there is at least some immunity and it largely deferred to lower courts to sort that out. That\u2019s a process that could take weeks or even months. Perhaps even more important, the majority made clear that official acts cannot be considered at all as evidence in a potential trial, which could make it much harder for Smith to prevail. Chief Justice John Roberts also wrote that the lower courts may not consider a former president\u2019s motive, which may allow Trump\u2019s attorneys to argue that he wasn\u2019t attempting to overturn an election in his favor at all. \u201cI know I will respect the limits of the presidential powers I\u2019ve had for three-and-a-half years, but any president \u2013 including Donald Trump \u2013 will now be free to ignore the law,\u201d Biden said. Biden, who has made protecting democracy a central tenet of his campaign, described the decision as a broader pattern from the Supreme Court in undermining \u201ca wide range of long-established legal principles,\u201d pointing to other decisions on voting rights and civil rights as he implicitly laid out the stakes for the presidential election. He added that voters now hold the ultimate say over holding Trump accountable. \u201cThe American people must decide if they want to entrust \u2026 the presidency to Donald Trump, now knowing that he\u2019ll be even more emboldened to do whatever he pleases whenever he wants to do it.\u201d He added, \u201cI concur with Justice (Sonia) Sotomayor\u2019s dissent today. Here\u2019s what she said \u2013 she said, \u2018In every use of official power, the president is now a king above the law. With fear for our democracy, I dissent,\u2019 end of quote. So should the American people dissent. I dissent.\u201d The Supreme Court\u2019s decision had an instant effect \u2013 Trump\u2019s legal team filed a letter Monday seeking to challenge the former president\u2019s conviction in his New York criminal hush money trial based on the high court\u00a0ruling on presidential immunity, a source told CNN. Trump\u2019s lawyer filed a letter with Judge Juan\u00a0Merchan seeking permission to file a motion to challenge the verdict, the source said. If the judge allows Trump to file the motion it could delay Trump\u2019s sentencing \u2013 set for next week \u2013 to allow the parties to brief the issue. The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office\u00a0did not file its sentencing submission Monday as expected, according to a source.

{"id": "2024_06_26_politics_primaries-maga-squad-what-matters", "text": "There must be some sort of larger takeaway in the fact that Rep. Lauren Boebert, among the most MAGA members of Congress, won a Republican primary in Colorado on Tuesday night, and Rep. Jamaal Bowman, a member of the progressive \u201cSquad\u201d from the Bronx, lost a Democratic primary to a more moderate candidate from Westchester County in New York. Every House race is different, obviously, since all politics is local, according to the old saying. So it would be an oversimplification to say that Republicans moved more MAGA and Democrats moved more moderate based on these two unrelated races. More MAGA or moderate? And yet there\u2019s evidence to support that general trend. Look no further than the two parties\u2019 presidential candidates. Former President Donald Trump personifies MAGA, and a large part of the Make America Great Again ethos he pushes is loyalty to him. President Joe Biden, on the other hand, effectively worked with Republicans to pass a bill to improve the nation\u2019s infrastructure and has said he wants to work with Republicans on immigration reform. Many Republicans will tell you they don\u2019t believe Biden. There\u2019s nothing moderate about either Boebert or Bowman, who occupy space on the fringe of their respective parties. Both were also seriously flawed candidates with problems that extend beyond policy. Boebert was kicked out of a theater last year for vaping and \u201ccausing a disturbance,\u201d for instance. Bowman was charged last year with pulling a fire alarm in a House office building when there was no emergency. Rather than face voters in the district she narrowly won two years ago, Boebert moved to run in a district with a more conservative voting record. She emerged from a crowded field to win the Republican primary in the district, which was previously represented by Rep. Ken Buck, a conservative Republican who is a critic of Trump and had resigned from office in frustration. Bowman, on the other hand, was targeted by more mainstream Democrats in part for his loud criticism of Israel in its war on Hamas in Gaza, an issue that has split Democrats this year. Pro-Israel groups spent heavily in the race, attempting to oust Bowman. However, in advertising, Bowman was attacked more for his opposition to Biden\u2019s policies than for his position on Israel. Evidence of a liberal retreat I asked CNN\u2019s Gregory Krieg, who covered the Bowman race, why he thinks Bowman lost and what it says about Democrats today. Here\u2019s what he emailed back: KRIEG: There are obviously many ways to read Bowman\u2019s defeat, and his failure to bridge the gap with pro-Israel Jewish voters in the district, specifically in Westchester, is understandably the one you\u2019re hearing most often. But I also think, if we\u2019re looking at this through a national lens, it\u2019s hard to not see it as part of the broader liberal retreat from some of the more aggressive left-wing characters and candidates they embraced during Trump\u2019s presidency.\u00a0 For all the talk about Democrats\u2019 lack of enthusiasm about Biden personally, the idea of Biden \u2013 the moderate, even-tempered statesman type \u2013 is still very, very popular. And (Westchester County Executive George) Latimer, to some extent, embodied that.  It obviously did not help Bowman that AIPAC (the American Israel Public Affairs Committee) and other outside groups bombarded him with record spending and gobs of money invested in research into every thought that\u2019s crossed his mind the last 25 years.  That primary voters did not hold the spending against Latimer, as progressives argued they should, also reminds me that voters (especially Democrats) in presidential cycles tend to be cautious. You\u2019ll probably never hear Trump, Fox News or anyone on the right mention Latimer\u2019s name. And for some folks left-of-center, that\u2019s priceless. Utah went its own way While Boebert\u2019s victory provides a foil for Bowman\u2019s loss, it was far from a perfect night for more MAGA Republicans. In a separate Colorado race, the chair of the state GOP, Dave Williams, who had gotten Trump\u2019s endorsement but who said controversial things about gay rights \u2013 including that Pride flags should be burned \u2013 lost to the more establishment pick, Jeff Crank, a real estate investor and former talk radio host. And in Utah, Republicans snubbed the MAGA options for both governor and senator in a state that is very conservative but where the base of Mormon voters has bristled at the former president. Current Sen. Mitt Romney is a notable Trump critic in the GOP, and his decision not to run for reelection opened up an opportunity to replace one of the few remaining Republicans who voted to convict Trump on impeachment charges in 2021 with a Trump-backed Republican. Rep. John Curtis, the winner of the GOP Senate primary, did not vote to convict Trump as a member of the House, but he is the rare Republican focused on climate change, an issue that disproportionately affects Utah but which Trump dismisses. The larger problem \u2026 Both Curtis and Gov. Spencer Cox were actually rejected by GOP party activists at the state\u2019s nominating convention but found their way onto the ballot with the help of signature drives. Cox has taken more moderate positions on certain issues and was booed at the state GOP convention this year,\u00a0according to The Associated Press. But Cox and Curtis both easily won their primaries, which essentially determine the winner of statewide contests in a state like Utah. It\u2019s a shame that primary voters are becoming the de facto general election voters in states and districts that lean heavily to one side or the other, according to former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, a Republican who wrote a lament in The Washington Post that most of the country lives in a state with \u201ctrifecta\u201d government, where one party controls most of what\u2019s happening at their state level. Daniels writes: The issue isn\u2019t simply that states lean reliably Republican or Democratic. It\u2019s that now a big majority are heavily, maybe irrevocably, tilted in one direction or the other. Where that obtains, office seekers pitch their initial appeals to the hard core on their side, as primary candidates always have. The difference is that, instead of the winner\u2019s traditional post-primary imperative, to reach out to nonpartisans and even open-minded members of the opposing party, now their job is finished. There are efforts to change this dynamic, which we\u2019ve written about in this newsletter, such as in states experimenting with nonpartisan primaries and ranked-choice voting. But Daniels has a point. None of the races we\u2019ve discussed so far in this story are expected to be at all competitive in November.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/politics/primaries-maga-squad-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_politics_white-house-biden-mental-fitness", "text": "The White House on Tuesday fended off tough questions about President Joe Biden\u2019s mental fitness, acknowledging his poor performance in last week\u2019s debate while maintaining the president is still able to hold and run for office. \u201cFirst of all, I want to say, we understand the concerns. We get it. The president did not have a great night,\u201d White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. She later added: \u201cWe\u2019re not taking away from what the American people saw.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s press briefing, the first since the debate, came as Biden has faced one of the toughest stretches of his presidency and with his reelection campaign reeling. Campaign officials are scrambling to calm donors who were shocked by Biden\u2019s halting, hoarse performance. The White House announced Tuesday\u00a0that Biden\u00a0is expected to\u00a0meet with Democratic governors and congressional leaders Wednesday after\u00a0some\u00a0demanded a meeting with the president. Some officials have been turned off by the Biden campaign\u2019s dismissiveness over their concerns about the president\u2019s health. And earlier Tuesday, a Democratic member of Congress became the first to ask Biden to drop out of the race. The White House preempted the first questions from reporters by announcing Biden will appear in two high-profile events over the next week: an interview with ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos that will air in part on Friday and a solo news conference during the NATO summit in Washington next week. Such unscripted events are rare for the president, who by CNN\u2019s count lags behind his most recent predecessors in formal press conferences. Thursday\u2019s debate was the biggest audience Biden has had since his last round of debates against former President Donald Trump four years ago \u2013 exacerbating the shock some felt at his performance. Asked whether Biden regularly presents himself the way he did at the debate, Jean-Pierre evoked a speech that Biden gave in North Carolina the day after the debate: \u201cHe understands that he\u2019s not a young man,\u201d she said, adding that his focus is going to be on continuing \u201cto deliver for the American people on the issues that they care about.\u201d In a deeply reported piece published Tuesday, The New York Times reported that people in the room with Biden have become increasingly concerned with how he has recently presented himself, describing the president as seeming confused at some points during two high-profile trips to Europe in recent weeks. Biden has increasingly indicated he is aware of the problems with his debate performance as the fallout within his own party has mounted. The president said during a fundraiser Tuesday that he \u201calmost fell asleep onstage\u201d during CNN\u2019s presidential debate last week, according to pool reports. \u201cI decided to travel around the world a couple of times \u2026 shortly before the debate \u2026 I didn\u2019t listen to my staff \u2026 and then I almost fell asleep onstage,\u201d Biden said during the fundraiser in Virginia on Tuesday evening. The remark was met with laughter from those in attendance, according to a recording of the president\u2019s remarks. Multiple reporters who were in the room said that they believed the \u201cfell asleep\u201d line appeared intended to be a joke and that Biden was trying to make light of the situation in a self-deprecating way, but it did not land, in their view. Jean-Pierre reiterated during the press briefing that Biden had been sick during the debate last week \u2013 adding that he still had a cold. The president did not take any cold medication prior to the debate, she said. \u201cI would not see this as an episode,\u201d Jean-Pierre said. \u201cI would see this as what it was and what we believe it to be \u2013 which is, it was a bad night.\u201d She added the administration is \u201cabsolutely not\u201d hiding information about the president\u2019s health or ability to do his job. Jean-Pierre also addressed recent reporting that Hunter Biden had been joining his father in recent White House meetings. NBC was the\u00a0first to report\u00a0on Hunter Biden\u2019s participation in the meetings. Jean-Pierre said the president\u2019s son, who was convicted last month on three felony gun charges,\u00a0returned to the White House with his father after spending the weekend at Camp David and \u201cwalked with him into\u201d a meeting to prepare for Biden\u2019s Monday night speech on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Trump\u2019s immunity case. \u201cAnd he ended up spending time with his dad and his family that night. That is basically what happened,\u201d Jean-Pierre said. \u201cThey were together at Camp David. They came back together.\u201d Jean-Pierre also declined to engage with a question from CNN\u2019s MJ Lee on a CNN poll conducted following last week\u2019s debate showing Vice President Kamala Harris outpacing Biden in a hypothetical race against Trump. The poll shows Harris within striking distance of Trump in a hypothetical matchup: 47% of registered voters support Trump and 45% Harris, a result within the margin of error that suggests there is no clear leader under such a scenario. Jean-Pierre offered a confusing response referring the inquiry to the president\u2019s reelection campaign. \u201cWhat I can speak to, is the president\u2019s record. What I can speak to what he\u2019s been able to accomplish,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the things that he\u2019s been able to do and get done \u2026 is actually in line with majority of Americans. And I think that\u2019s important to note, and again, I will say with age comes wisdom and experience. And that certainly it\u2019s something that the president brings.\u201d Harris batted down the idea of running in Biden\u2019s place during a brief interview with CBS Tuesday afternoon: \u201cLook, Joe Biden is our nominee. We beat Trump once and we\u2019re going to beat him again, period,\u201d she said. This story has been updated with additional reporting.

{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_donald-trump-winning-streak", "text": "Donald Trump used to tell his fans that he\u2019d win so much, they\u2019d get tired of winning. This week, that might be true for once. President Joe Biden\u2019s incoherent and painful debate performance in Atlanta on Thursday night gave Trump a massive victory in the most pivotal moment of the 2024 White House campaign so far as he seeks to win a non-consecutive second term and pull off a stunning political comeback. Trump basked in the aftermath of the debate during a rally on Friday in Virginia and drew a link between what he said was the \u201cdecline\u201d of both his opponent and America. \u201cAs every American saw firsthand last night, this election is a choice between strength and weakness, competence and incompetence, peace and prosperity, war or no war,\u201d\u00a0Trump\u00a0said. Hours after the debate, a US Supreme Court ruling that the Justice Department overstepped in charging January 6 Capitol rioters handed the presumptive Republican nominee what he immediately hailed on social media as a \u201cBIG WIN.\u201d The 6-3 decision was a symbolic victory for the ex-president the day after he used the debate to try to whitewash the worst attack on democracy in modern times. There could also be legal ramifications with some scholars arguing the ruling could narrow the scope of Trump\u2019s federal election interference trial, even if special counsel Jack Smith believes his case can proceed unaffected. The ex-president\u2019s lawyers are already signaling they will seek to get evidence tossed and obstruction counts against the ex-president dismissed. The court released its decision ahead of an even more critical case that will bear more directly on Trump\u2019s criminal entanglements. On Monday, justices are expected to finally rule on his expansive claim of immunity for acts committed while president. If the long-awaited ruling by the conservative-majority court mandates new litigation in a lower court, it could have the effect of pushing Smith\u2019s election interference trial well beyond November\u2019s election even if it does not immediately curtail aspects of the special counsel\u2019s prosecution. Trump\u2019s year of peaks and disasters With Trump eyeing a return to the White House, the justices\u2019 evaluation of never-before-considered arguments on the limits of executive power is especially critical given his controversial belief that he would enjoy near unfettered authority in the Oval Office that would effectively place the presidency above the law. There was more good legal news for Trump in Florida, as federal Judge Aileen Cannon, whom he appointed, on Thursday plunged deeper into pretrial litigation in the case over his alleged handling of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort. The way Cannon has overseen the case \u2013 and her frequent clashes with Smith\u2019s team \u2013 have already ensured that another one of Trump\u2019s criminal indictments will not go to trial before the election. And like the federal election interference case, the documents matter is one that a Trump-appointed attorney general in a second administration would have the power to dismiss. A second 2020 election case, in Georgia, is also stalled \u2013 partly over a controversy and appeals process triggered by a relationship between District Attorney Fani Willis and a prosecutor she appointed. There have been plenty of grim weeks for Trump this year, especially over the weekslong hush money trial that resulted in him becoming the first ex-president and major party presumptive nominee to be found guilty of a crime. And on July 11, his humiliation will be reinforced when he attends sentencing in New York before Judge Juan Merchan. His enforced attendance will epitomize his year of personal and political troughs and highs as it will take place just days before the ex-president travels to the Republican National Convention to formally accept his third consecutive presidential nomination. Trump is also expected to use the event in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to unveil his vice-presidential nominee. There are still four months until the election \u2013 a span of political time that could see unforeseen events and crises at home and abroad that could transform the race. But Thursday night\u2019s debate could hardly have gone better for Trump, who has been locked in a neck-and-neck race with Biden with a slight edge in the swing states that will decide the election. While it\u2019s too early to assess how voters will respond, the president\u2019s disastrous performance unleashed despair among Democrats now questioning whether Biden should remain on the ticket. Even if Biden manages to bounce back, his campaign will never be able to erase the impressions of millions of television viewers who saw an elderly man struggling to compete sentences, losing his train of thought and gaping in apparent open-mouthed confusion at Trump \u2013 who cut a more vigorous, if deceitful, figure. The optics of the night helped reinforce a Republican narrative that the 81-year-old president is suffering from compromised cognition and the views of a majority of Americans that he\u2019s too old to serve a second term. Biden\u2019s struggles also gave Trump a free pass on a night when his gusher of lies and conspiracy theories showed that if anything, he\u2019s become more vengeful and threatening to the rule of law since he left office in disgrace after a chaotic one-term presidency in January 2021. A more effective presidential performance in the debate might have inflicted terminal damage on Trump\u2019s campaign. But while Biden failed his test of vitality at the debate, the ex-president\u2019s generally calm demeanor in the critical early exchanges meant that he did not play into Biden\u2019s accusations that he is \u201cunhinged\u201d and that something has \u201csnapped\u201d in him. While the president did manage to highlight Trump\u2019s extreme behavior and falsehoods later in the evening, the initial sparring was so devastating to Biden that his successes may have passed many voters by. Trump is only three years younger than Biden and often lapses into gibberish in campaign events. But polls show that voters worry less about his mental faculties and age. Many senior Democrats publicly argued on Friday that a bad debate did not mean that the reality of the election \u2013 involving a Republican candidate who has already sought to destroy democracy and might do so again \u2013 has not changed. Yet the stark truth for Biden is that his fumbling performance will only exacerbate concerns of many voters who cannot imagine him fully executing a second term that would end when he is 86. The Supreme Court hands Trump more favorable news In the January 6 case the Supreme Court on Friday ruled that the Justice Department overstepped by bringing obstruction charges against hundreds of people who rioted at the Capitol. At least some of those cases are likely to be reopened. The high court did however rule that the charge could still be filed against the rioters if prosecutors are able to show they were attempting not just to push their way into the building, but rather to stop the certification of the 2020 election. This wrinkle may allow Smith to also maintain the same charge against Trump. Trump\u2019s team expects to file motions to get obstruction counts against the former president dismissed, a source familiar with the matter told CNN\u2019s Paula Reid. Still, Smith\u2019s case against the presumptive GOP nominee is based on a more sweeping set of events and evidence than that arrayed against members of the pro-Trump mob. But even if a new legal gambit by Trump\u2019s team is successful in delaying proceedings with more litigation it would bolster his long-term goal of delaying the trial. As it is, there seems little chance a jury will hear the case in the coming months unless there is a blanket rejection by the high court of Trump\u2019s immunity claim next week. However, if Trump loses the election, and the case goes ahead unhindered, even the chance that his lawyers could narrow his criminal exposure could be immensely valuable to the ex-president. In the Florida documents case, Cannon said on Thursday that she wants to hold additional hearings on Trump\u2019s attempt to challenge key evidence and will allow his lawyers to question witnesses about the investigation and the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago for classified documents in 2022. Cannon has been accused of dragging out the case over multiple hearings. Some critics have put the delays down to her inexperience. Others have suggested that she\u2019s operating out of favoritism to the president who appointed her. But in an 11-page order Thursday, the judge rebuked critics. \u201cThere is a difference between a resource-wasting and delay-producing \u2018mini-trial,\u2019 on the one hand, and an evidentiary hearing geared to adjudicating the contested factual and legal issues on a given pre-trial motion to suppress,\u201d Cannon wrote. As far as Trump is concerned, Cannon can string out the case as long as she wants, especially if it keeps his favorable recent good run going.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/politics/donald-trump-winning-streak/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_politics_cnn-poll-post-debate", "text": "Three-quarters of\u00a0US\u00a0voters say the Democratic Party would have a better shot at holding the presidency in 2024 with someone other than President Joe Biden at the top of the ticket, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS.\u00a0His approval rating also\u00a0has hit a new low following a shaky performance in the first debate of this year\u2019s presidential campaign. In a matchup between the presumptive major-party nominees,\u00a0voters nationwide favor former President Donald Trump over Biden by 6 points, 49% to 43%, identical to the results of CNN\u2019s national poll on the presidential race in April, and consistent with the lead Trump has held in CNN polling back to last fall. There are some signs in the poll that each candidate has consolidated support among their own partisans in recent months, a period that has seen both Trump\u2019s conviction on felony charges in a New York court and the first\u00a0general election\u00a0debate of the contest, though independents appear increasingly reluctant to support either man. The poll also finds Vice President Kamala Harris within striking distance of Trump in a hypothetical matchup:\u00a047% of registered voters support Trump, 45% Harris, a\u00a0result\u00a0within\u00a0the\u00a0margin of error\u00a0that suggests there is no clear leader under such a scenario. Harris\u2019 slightly stronger showing against Trump rests at least in part on broader support from\u00a0women (50% of female voters back Harris over Trump vs. 44% for Biden against Trump) and independents (43% Harris vs. 34% Biden). Several other Democrats have\u00a0been mentioned as potential Biden replacements in recent days,\u00a0and\u00a0each trails Trump among registered voters, with\u00a0their\u00a0levels of support similar to Biden\u2019s, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom (48% Trump to 43% Newsom), Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg (47% Trump to 43% Buttigieg), and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (47% Trump to 42% Whitmer). Biden\u2019s campaign has\u00a0insisted he will not drop out\u00a0of the race, and while some Democratic insiders have privately discussed the possibility of replacing him as the nominee, any path forward would be both\u00a0logistically difficult\u00a0and\u00a0politically risky. Biden\u2019s support among Democratic voters has inched up to 91% from 85% in April,\u00a0while\u00a093% of Republicans back Trump (about even since April). Trump maintains a roughly 10-point advantage among independents (44% to 34% in the new poll), while the share of independents who choose neither candidate or say they do not plan to vote has climbed from 15% to 21%. Both Biden and Trump supporters have grown likelier to say their choice is an affirmative vote of support rather than one against the opposing party\u2019s candidate, but the election continues to be driven more by feelings about Trump than about Biden. Two-thirds (66%) of Trump backers say they\u2019re voting mainly for him rather than against Biden (up from 60% in January) while 37% of Biden\u2019s supporters say their vote is more for the president than against his predecessor (up from 32% earlier this year). However,\u00a0most Democrats and Democratic-leaning registered voters (56%) say the party has a better shot at the presidency with someone other than Biden, while 43% say the party stands a better chance with him. Democratic confidence in Biden\u2019s chances has not increased since he locked up the party\u2019s nomination in the primaries: In January, 53% felt the party would have a better shot with someone other than Biden at the top of the ticket and 46% felt more confident with Biden. At the same time, Republican-aligned voters have grown considerably more positive about their chances to win with Trump than without him: 83% now say that the GOP has a better shot to win with Trump, compared with 72% who felt that way in January. Biden\u2019s approval rating in the poll has fallen to a new low among all Americans (36%), with 45% now saying they strongly disapprove of his performance, a new high in CNN\u2019s polling. Among the full US public, Biden\u2019s favorability rating stands at just 34%, with 58% viewing him unfavorably.\u00a0And\u00a0while many of the Democratic names bandied about as possible replacements for Biden are less widely disliked, none would start with more public goodwill \u2013 instead, they are less well known. Harris has the widest recognition \u2013 and is also deeply underwater, with a 29% favorability rating, 49% rating her unfavorably, and 22% saying they have no opinion or haven\u2019t heard of her. Roughly half of the public has no opinion on Buttigieg (50%) and Newsom (48%), with about two-thirds (69%) offering no opinion of Whitmer. The events of the past several months have done little to shift Trump\u2019s image either way. Since April, Trump has been found guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records at his New York hush money trial and had a debate performance widely viewed as a win (76% of voters who watched or followed news about it say he did the better job in last week\u2019s debate, while only 23% say Biden did). But his favorability rating remains deeply negative: 39% have a favorable view of Trump and 54% an unfavorable one, about the same as it has been since last fall. The pool of double-hater voters \u2013 those with unfavorable views of both Biden and Trump \u2013 remains about the same: 18% fall into that category, and they break in Trump\u2019s favor, 41% to 31%. And a generic congressional matchup in the poll suggests a near-even contest for the House of Representatives: 47% of registered voters nationwide would choose the Republican candidate in their district, 45% the Democrat. Perceptions of Biden and Trump post-debate About 9 in 10 registered voters in the poll (91%) say there are important differences between Trump and Biden, and when asked to name those key differences, voters most frequently mention honesty, ability to handle the job and service to the country above self as distinguishing factors. Among Biden\u2019s backers, 31% say the most important difference is around honesty and integrity, while the top response among Trump\u2019s supporters is fitness for the job (24% say that). The poll also reveals how voters see the strengths and weaknesses of each candidate. Voters appear to have significant questions about Biden\u2019s handling of key issues and his physical and mental abilities. They trust Trump over Biden on two of the three issues they consider most important to their choice for president (Trump leads on the economy and immigration by roughly 20 points, with Biden holding a slight 5-point edge on protecting democracy).\u00a0When asked about whether certain attributes were reasons to vote for or against each candidate, 72% of voters say Biden\u2019s physical and mental abilities are a reason to vote against him rather than for him. For Trump, views are narrowly positive: 43% see his physical and mental abilities as a plus and 39% as a minus. Beyond Trump\u2019s advantages on the economy and immigration, the former president is more trusted than Biden on foreign policy (46% to 36%) and handling the role of commander in chief (43% Trump to 35% Biden). Biden\u2019s strengths are on abortion and reproductive rights (44% trust Biden, 32% Trump) and health care (44% Biden to 34% Trump). A plurality say they trust neither Biden nor Trump to unite the country (39% feel that way), while 31% say they trust Biden more to do so and 30% Trump. Biden\u2019s demeanor and temperament \u2013 a strong point for him in the 2020 presidential election \u2013 is a net neutral for him, though a clear negative for Trump (41% see it as a reason to vote against Biden\u00a0and\u00a039% a reason to vote for him, compared with 57% describing demeanor and temperament as a reason to vote against Trump). Convincing movable voters The president\u2019s central challenge in his reelection bid remains winning over skeptical and persuadable voters, and the poll suggests neither Biden nor Trump have won them over yet. Among all registered voters, 31% either say they could change their minds between now and Election Day or do not support a specific candidate. The almost 7 in 10 voters who have made up their minds break heavily for Trump \u2013 53% to 45%. In order to overtake Trump, Biden would have to bring a significant share of these movable voters to his side, though they currently split 39% for Trump to 37% for Biden in a two-way matchup; 8% say they\u2019d back someone else and 14% that they don\u2019t plan to vote. These persuadable voters are more likely to dislike both Trump and Biden (38% have an unfavorable view of both candidates, compared with 9% among voters who have made a choice), and are less likely to see important differences between Biden and Trump (18% say they are pretty much the same, compared with 5% of those who have made a choice). These voters are also more likely to support an alternative Democrat against Trump than they are to choose Biden. In hypothetical matchups, they break 47% for Harris to 34% for Trump, 42% for Newsom to 36% for Trump, and 42% for Buttigieg to 35% for Trump. The CNN poll was conducted by SSRS from June 28-30 among a random national sample of 1,274 adults drawn from a probability-based panel, including 1,045 registered voters. Surveys were conducted either online or by telephone with a live interviewer. Results among the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

{"id": "2024_07_02_politics_biden-debate-performance-democrats", "text": "Defiance has become as much a part of Joe Biden\u2019s psychology as Delaware. But as the president and his inner circle dig in following his disastrous debate performance last week, a growing number of Democratic leaders are saying they want him to step aside for the good of the party \u2013 and the country. Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas was the first to break ranks. \u201cI represent the heart of a congressional district once represented by Lyndon Johnson.\u00a0Under very different circumstances, he made the painful decision to withdraw.\u00a0President Biden should do the same,\u201d Doggett said in his statement Tuesday. \u201cThere\u2019s a large and increasing group of House Democrats concerned about the president\u2019s candidacy, representing a broad swath of the caucus,\u201d another House Democratic lawmaker told CNN on condition of anonymity to speak candidly. \u201cWe are deeply concerned about his trajectory and his ability to win. We want to give him space to make a decision [to step aside], but we will be increasingly vocal about our concerns if he doesn\u2019t.\u201d Biden is expected to meet Wednesday with Democratic governors and congressional leaders, the White House said Tuesday. The announcement came after CNN reported that some governors expressed concerns about the president\u2019s debate performance. The governors, one source said, were worried about going public with their concerns out of fear it would lead to Biden digging in further. CNN talked to more than two dozen current and former Democratic officials, as well as donors and longtime Biden allies, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid alienating Biden. Many of these people say they have already made up their minds that the president should quit his campaign, a decision some of them think he needs to announce this week. They have held off going to Biden directly, hoping he would make the decision himself, but patience is wearing thin, multiple Democrats told CNN, amid signs that Biden has taken no steps to seriously consider the mounting concerns.\u00a0He is poised to travel to swing states this weekend, aides said, a sign that he has no plans of changing course. On Tuesday, ABC News announced Biden will sit down with George Stephanopoulos for his first TV interview since the debate, with clips airing on Friday. Initially, there was hope that the president\u2019s family would convince him to step aside,\u00a0given how badly the debate went. However, at a Biden retreat Sunday at Camp David, it became apparent the president\u2019s family rallied around his decision to continue his campaign, blaming staff for his missteps. \u201cOne word you know about Biden: stubborn,\u201d said one senior Democratic official who has publicly supported Biden in the past but who privately thinks he needs to step aside. \u201cThey are trying to give him the space to realize what a disaster this is.\u201d And while the Biden campaign has insisted the debate was just a bad night for the 81-year-old president, the Democrats who want him to step aside say it was not a one-off incident that can be fixed. \u201cThis is not like Obama being rusty for a debate,\u201d said a senior Democratic official, referring to former President Barack Obama\u2019s lackluster performance in his first debate against Republican opponent Mitt Romney in 2012. \u201c[Biden] might be able to survive this if this was the only incident. But it won\u2019t be the only incident,\u201d said a senior Capitol Hill Democratic official. \u201cWe have to be honest with ourselves that it wasn\u2019t just a horrible night,\u201d Illinois Rep. Mike Quigley told Kasie Hunt on\u00a0\u201cCNN This Morning\u201d on Tuesday.\u00a0\u201cHe clearly has to understand, I think, what you\u2019re getting to here is that his decision not only impacts who\u2019s going to serve in the White House the next four years but who\u2019s going to serve in the Senate, who\u2019s going to serve in the House, and it will have implications for decades to come.\u201d During an interview on MSNBC on Tuesday, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called on Biden to participate in multiple interviews with journalists in the aftermath of his debate performance. The California Democrat,\u00a0who emphasized it is Biden\u2019s decision\u00a0about whether to step aside,\u00a0said she has heard \u201cmixed\u201d responses to the debate from donors and others in her Democratic network. \u201cI\u00a0think\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0a\u00a0legitimate\u00a0question\u00a0to\u00a0say,\u00a0is\u00a0this\u00a0an\u00a0episode\u00a0or\u00a0is\u00a0this\u00a0a\u00a0condition?\u201d Pelosi said, referring to Biden\u2019s debate performance. She quickly added that this was a legitimate question for former President Donald Trump as well, citing his\u00a0repeated lies\u00a0during the debate. Stakes have never been higher The stakes, already remarkable, were raised even higher after the Supreme Court on Monday ruled Trump is entitled to considerable immunity from prosecution, a development that some concerned Democrats say makes it more urgent for Biden to step aside. The decision hands the former president a significant legal win and \u201cmakes Trump even more dangerous,\u201d said one former elected Democratic official who has supported Biden for years but who now wants him to end his campaign. One Biden adviser argued that the decision, and the fears of how Trump might now feel emboldened to act if reelected, only strengthens Biden\u2019s argument for staying in, as what that adviser said still feels like the surest bet of beating Trump. Some\u00a0leading Democrats, including at least one high-ranking Biden administration official,\u00a0have already started discussing what they believe would be a painful process to replace Biden and\u00a0pick a new ticket. In addition to Vice President Kamala Harris, a handful of governors and lawmakers are waiting on the Democratic bench. With\u00a0just\u00a0six weeks until the\u00a0Democratic National Convention\u00a0and under 130 days until the election, they want to get started. Facing\u00a0the highest-stakes moment of his long career, Biden is doubling down. The president who still thinks of himself as the stuttering kid so poor he had to wear nuts and bolts as cufflinks to a ninth-grade dance is still holding on to hope that this can be the latest time he comes back after being written off. \u201cHe bets on himself, and he always takes the long view, and he is not a reactionary like a lot of these folks are,\u201d said one person with years of experience in Biden\u2019s orbit. However, Biden has not reached out to Democratic Party leaders himself to reassure them or to get feedback, something that many sources told CNN they found astounding given the fallout from the debate. \u201cThey\u2019re equating this moment to every moment they\u2019ve overcome before, and not realizing it\u2019s a totally different moment,\u201d a Democratic operative close to the campaign said in reference to Biden and his inner circle. During a fundraiser in the Hamptons on Saturday, Biden used a teleprompter, something at least one donor mentioned as troubling. Meanwhile, first lady Jill Biden stuck to the Biden family mythology of resilience while introducing her husband. \u201cJoe\u2019s mom used to say that God never gives us a cross too heavy to carry,\u201d she said. \u201cJoe isn\u2019t just the right person for the job; he\u2019s the only person for the job. \u2026 Joe\u2019s mom was right, there isn\u2019t a cross he can\u2019t bear, that he won\u2019t shoulder for our country and our democracy.\u201d Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, the closest of Biden\u2019s political allies, told CNN he would like to see the president counter the narrative of being too old and incompetent for the job by doing more public events, town halls and interviews. Ahead of the announcement of the ABC interview, White House advisers said Monday that Biden was considering a high-profile interview in the coming days to help prove his fitness for office, in hopes of showing his energetic North Carolina rally the day after debate was not simply a fluke. Campaign aides are also mapping out a more robust travel schedule to battleground states in July. Many leading Democrats doubt that Biden is up to that \u2014 and they see his secluded schedule since Sunday as evidence they are correct. That schedule is keeping to Biden\u2019s general mode. Using one metric: Biden has held 36 news conferences since taking office, compared with Trump\u2019s 64 by this point in his presidency, Barack Obama\u2019s 72 at this point in his, and George W. Bush\u2019s 82 by this point in his. Trump has also been out of public view since a post-debate rally in Virginia on Friday and has no schedule for the rest of the week. Anchors for a local television station announced that he at the last minute canceled an interview after the rally after aides asked for the questions in advance. He is expected to spend much of the next few days in New Jersey golfing. Even for some of those who are staying committed to Biden, a sense has settled in that there is little chance he would be able to make it through the four years that another term would entail.\u00a0The debate performance has so shaken Democrats that even stalwarts like Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse told local reporters back home in Rhode Island on Monday that he wants a fuller accounting of the president\u2019s health. From the West Wing to Wilmington While the high command of the Biden campaign on Monday tried to \u201ckeep reassuring everybody and absorbing people\u2019s worries,\u201d one adviser said, there has been a growing appreciation for the anger and concern many Democrats have expressed. \u201cThe seriousness of this is felt by people in the West Wing and in Wilmington,\u201d a different adviser added. Several Biden advisers told CNN the campaign is still working to assess the true fallout of the debate among voters in key battleground states, with an eye on whether Biden has fallen in a head-to-head matchup with Trump or whether the field of swing states has expanded.\u00a0A range of engaged senior Democrats cite Minnesota and Virginia as important gauges, as well as the Senate race in Michigan. House Democrats are deep into their own polling, assessing how much damage has been done. As dark as the mood is among some aides \u2014 including those who feel the wind knocked out of them after years of internalizing a related Biden mythology that he always delivers in a crunch \u2014 others are hoping to prove wrong people who never believed in him. Responding to The New York Times Editorial Board on Friday calling for Biden to drop out, one Biden aide reached out to CNN to offer this: \u201cThat sh*t is like jet fuel in my veins I love it.\u201d The New York Times did not endorse Biden in the 2020 Democratic primaries. No clear fix The same small, insular inner circle that has guided Biden to this point is handling the fallout. Few familiar with how the members of that circle work believe it would be possible to force any of them out. Still, top aides at the Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee have spent the days since the debate on a constant churn of calls. Several people involved say that many of those calls have started badly but ended at least somewhat better. And the Biden campaign on Tuesday announced that June was its best fundraising month ever, with $127 million banked \u2014 with almost a third of that raised since the debate. Biden campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon on Monday evening told members of the campaign\u2019s National Finance Committee that the team is \u201cclear-eyed, not pollyannish,\u201d two participants on the call told CNN.\u00a0She did not telegraph anything about Biden\u2019s plans other than full steam ahead. But after several previous calls with donors boiled over, the campaign restricted that Zoom call so that the only way to pose questions was to put them in a moderated chat. \u201cEvery time Joe Biden is counted out, he proves his doubters wrong. I have faith he\u2019ll do it this time too,\u201d said Andrew Weinstein, a longtime Biden supporter and donor. Phil Murphy, the New Jersey governor who called Biden the \u201ccomeback kid\u201d at a fundraiser he hosted with the president on Saturday night, said that at their dinner table they had a wide-ranging, coherent conversation that covered, by his telling, Ukraine, the Middle East, wage growth, job creation, dealing more effectively with corporations, and expanding prekindergarten and community college. \u201cHis life story, almost every step of the way \u2014 including through tragedy \u2014 is the story of a guy who\u2019s been counted out and succeeds against all expectations and all odds,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s in another one of those moments.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.

{"id": "2024_07_02_politics_biden-trump-supreme-court-debate-analysis", "text": "\u201cI dissent!\u201d President Joe Biden was offering a dramatic, direct response to an epochal Supreme Court ruling that could hand presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump a pass to unchecked power if he wins a second term. But Biden\u2019s defiance also conveyed a poignant image of a president refusing to be pushed off the greatest political stage after a disastrous debate performance revealed the ravages of age. Biden appeared Monday night in the majestic surroundings of the cross hall just inside the front-door of the White House, with the presidential seal behind him and marble pillars on either side. But his argument \u2014 that presidents aren\u2019t kings \u2014 was the opposite of regal. Biden said that the high court\u2019s ruling on Trump\u2019s sweeping claim to be shielded from prosecution over his bid to steal the 2020 election \u2014 finding that presidents are immune related to official acts \u2014 was dangerous and unprecedented. \u201cNow the American people will have to do what the court should have been willing to do and would not: Americans will have to render a judgment about Donald Trump\u2019s behavior,\u201d Biden said. His address was both a major moment in the institutional history of the presidency and a calculated political gambit \u2014 the first step back from a ghastly and humiliating weekend filled by calls for him to abandon his presidential campaign. In four minutes, Biden, 81, encapsulated the two increasingly grave and urgent choices facing voters in November. \u2014 Will the country turn again to a 78-year-old former president with authoritarian instincts who believes that the Constitution gives him absolute power? \u2014 And does Biden, slowed by time\u2019s inexorable march and facing an existential personal political crisis have the strength to be the last barrier to Trump\u2019s autocratic ambitions? Biden\u2019s first attempt to rebound The president\u2019s appearance on Monday evening came after he returned from Camp David, where he\u2019d been staying since Saturday, surrounded by family members and assailed by speculation about his political future. Biden is braced for polls that will show whether his already tough path to reelection was further compromised by his hard-to-watch struggles on the debate stage. As a piece of political theater, the speech did nothing to quell the concerns about Biden\u2019s health, mental capacity and age raised by a painful showing in the CNN debate in Atlanta on Thursday when he sometimes looked vacant and was occasionally incoherent. Whether it was because of the ambient setting or a different type of television make-up, he looked bronzed and rested on Monday instead of wan and aged as he did in the debate. But even though he read from a teleprompter, the president\u2019s words were hurried together as those of older people sometimes are. And when he finished, the president ignored questions from a press pool. His delicate walk \u2014 almost a totter \u2014 back into the Blue Room underscored the loss of mobility that only reminds voters of his advancing years. Biden will require a higher volume and pace of public events and a level of energy and engagement for week after week to try to dispel the haunting images of a president, open mouthed and seemingly confused at last week\u2019s debate. Yet the forceful quality of Biden\u2019s delivery and the content of his words in the speech left no doubt of his convictions \u2014 even in far more manageable circumstances than a debate against the feral Trump. Monday\u2019s appearance was a classic example of how to deploy the imagery and rhetoric of the presidency. The court found that for \u201ccore\u201d presidential activity, Trump has the absolute immunity he had sought in a filing arising from his federal 2020 election interference case. The conservative majority said that Trump\u2019s conversations with the Justice Department, efforts to try to get officials on board with his effort to overturn the election, were covered with absolute immunity \u2013 a factor critics say could offer him an opening to use the department to seek reprisals against his personal enemies if he wins another term. For other official actions and more routine powers held by the president, the court said there is at least some immunity and largely deferred to lower courts to decide the scope. But Biden made a case for the presidency within the constraints of a constitutional system meant to contain executive power, not to unleash it. The irony of a president warning that the power of his own office must be circumscribed was consistent with the positions of all but a few US presidents who understood that the integrity of the public trust they held and American democracy depended on their restraint. Biden invoked George Washington, the first president, who established the tradition of willingly and peacefully ceding power that Trump abused four years ago, to argue that executive power is \u201climited not absolute.\u201d Presidential speeches don\u2019t need to be long to resonate. After all, the Gettysburg Address is only about 270 words long, depending on which transcription is used. And Biden\u2019s short first on-camera official appearance since the debate had its own punch and power. \u201cThe American people must decide whether Donald Trump\u2019s assault on our democracy on January 6 makes him unfit for public office in the highest office of land,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe American people must decide (whether) Trump\u2019s embrace of violence to preserve his power is acceptable. Perhaps most importantly, the American people must decide if they want to entrust the \u2026 presidency \u2026 once again \u2026 to \u2026 Donald Trump, now knowing he\u2019ll be more emboldened to do whatever he pleases whenever he wants to do it.\u201d Trump rages about the \u2018stench\u2019 from Biden \u2018hoaxes\u2019 Biden\u2019s measured reaction to the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling contrasted with the triumphant outburst of his predecessor that laid bare voters\u2019 choice in November. \u201cTHE SUPREME COURT DECISION IS A MUCH MORE POWERFUL ONE THAN SOME HAD EXPECTED IT TO BE. IT IS BRILLIANTLY WRITTEN AND WISE, AND CLEARS THE STENCH FROM THE BIDEN TRIALS AND HOAXES, ALL OF THEM, THAT HAVE BEEN USED AS AN UNFAIR ATTACK ON CROOKED JOE BIDEN\u2019S POLITICAL OPPONENT, ME,\u201d the ex-president wrote on his Truth Social platform. \u201cMANY OF THESE FAKE CASES WILL NOW DISAPPEAR, OR WITHER INTO OBSCURITY. GOD BLESS AMERICA!\u201d Trump\u2019s all-caps, self-obsession and false claims that he\u2019s a victim of politicized justice only reinforced Biden\u2019s arguments about the dangers he might present to democracy. But Trump\u2019s skill as a demagogue has convinced many of his supporters that Biden, and not the former president who refused to accept the result of an election, is the true threat to democracy. Trump has never hidden what he would do with enhanced executive power. After all, he has called for the termination of the Constitution in a social media post. During the pandemic in 2020, Trump declared falsely: \u201cWhen somebody\u2019s the President of the United States, the authority is total, and that\u2019s the way it\u2019s got to be.\u201d In his social media campaign apparently meant to sway the conservative majority on the Supreme Court before the judgment, the ex-president repeatedly said that without immunity for all acts, the presidency could not operate. And he\u2019s left no doubt that he\u2019d use a second term to pursue personal retribution. Those statements take on new significance given Monday\u2019s ruling. \u201cThis was not the grand slam that Trump was looking for, but it was very close,\u201d former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, a CNN senior law enforcement analyst, told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins on said \u201cThe Source\u201d Monday. \u201cThe definition of immunity is so broad \u2026 that with the addition of the elimination of using any official conduct as evidence in a prosecution that targets unofficial conduct, really carves out a minuscule area of prosecution for any president or former president.\u201d That reality appears likely to give Trump even greater latitude for his expansive interpretation of presidential powers if he wins in November \u2014 a factor that Biden is beseeching voters to consider. He directed Americans to the views of liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who issued a searing dissent against the Supreme Court\u2019s 6-3 decision. \u201cI concur with Justice Sotomayor\u2019s dissent today. Here\u2019s what she said \u2026 \u2018In every use of official power, the president is now a king above the law. With fear for our democracy, I dissent,\u2019 end of quote. So should the American people dissent.\u201d \u201cI dissent,\u201d Biden said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/politics/biden-trump-supreme-court-debate-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_politics_john-roberts-donald-trump-supreme-court-immunity-analysis", "text": "Chief Justice John Roberts is so enamored with the image of a bold and fearless American president that he abandoned his usual restraint and declared a stunning level of immunity for a former president facing criminal indictment\u00a0for trying to overturn an election. The man who famously likened judges to umpires who merely call balls and strikes instead, to re-employ a baseball clich\u00e9, swung for the fences. Roberts expansively interpreted constitutional protection for any president who might be indicted and all but ensured that former President Donald Trump will evade a trial for subverting the 2020 election before the 2024 presidential contest. Emphasizing the \u201cunrivaled gravity\u201d of presidential responsibilities and latching onto the term \u201cfearlessly,\u201d Roberts said a\u00a0president makes \u201cthe most sensitive and far-reaching decisions entrusted to any official\u201d and must be afforded the \u201cmaximum ability to deal fearlessly and impartially\u201d with his duties. Joined by five\u00a0of his\u00a0fellow\u00a0Republican-appointed\u00a0justices (three by Trump himself), Roberts adopted an unstinting vision of presidential immunity,\u00a0his\u00a0traditional\u00a0regard\u00a0for the stature of the judiciary eclipsed by\u00a0an aspiration\u00a0for the institution of the presidency. Usually, Roberts cares about such overtly political divisions. Usually, he takes a more judicially institutional approach. He\u00a0is also\u00a0certainly aware that in\u00a0previous\u00a0weighty disputes over the separation of powers, the 1974 case of US v. Nixon, the 1997 case of Clinton v. Jones,\u00a0the justices ruled\u00a0unanimously\u00a0\u2013 and both times against a sitting president. In those cases, justices voted\u00a0against the interests of the president\u00a0who appointed them. But that is not this\u00a0court. And the Roberts of today barely resembles the chief justice known for brokering compromises in politically charged disputes, including to uphold Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act just months before the 2012 presidential election. Today\u2019s bench reflects the deep political polarization\u00a0of the\u00a0country. Where Roberts\u00a0minimized\u00a0the chaos propagated by Trump after the 2020 election, dissenting justices emphasized it. More substantively, they said Roberts\u2019 \u201csingle-minded fixation on the President\u2019s need for boldness and dispatch\u201d defied constitutional history and\u00a0relevant past cases. In turn, Roberts ridiculed\u00a0the three liberal dissenters, saying, \u201cthey strike a tone of chilling doom.\u201d Tense courtroom for opinion There was a time when Roberts took pains to suggest disapproval of the norm-busting Trump,\u00a0even publicly rebutting the former president\u2019s attacks against the judiciary.\u00a0But on Monday,\u00a0Roberts\u00a0provided a cool distillation of the events leading up to the January 6, 2021,\u00a0assault on the US Capitol and\u00a0avoided\u00a0references to the former president. Roberts, who served in the Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations, has in the past favored executive branch prerogatives. The resolution of Trump v. United States, however, is more sweeping and likely to define Roberts\u2019 broader legacy as chief justice. An appointee of President George W. Bush, Roberts will begin his 20th\u00a0session in the center chair next October. On Monday, as the\u00a069-year-old\u00a0chief justice read portions of his opinion from the bench, he made use of some of the most dramatic lines in his\u00a0written\u00a0opinion, asserting that if\u00a0newly elected\u00a0presidents were free to prosecute their predecessors, the result would be \u201can executive branch that cannibalizes itself.\u201d Roberts said that under \u201ca pall of potential prosecution,\u201d\u00a0a president would hesitate to make decisions \u201cfearlessly and fairly\u201d and be rendered essentially ineffective.\u00a0The president, he wrote,\u00a0must be shielded from prosecution for any \u201ccore constitutional powers,\u201d and\u00a0\u201centitled, at a minimum, to a presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts.\u201d The court\u2019s new \u201cpresumptive immunity\u201d offers Trump a substantial victory at this stage of the protracted case brought by\u00a0Justice Department\u00a0special counsel Jack Smith. Last August, Smith\u00a0charged Trump\u00a0with various counts of conspiracy, fraud and obstruction for the activities that culminated\u00a0on January 6. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, speaking for dissenters,\u00a0heightened\u00a0the\u00a0rhetoric, condemning the majority for favoring Trump in a way that \u201creshapes the institution of the presidency\u201d and \u201cmakes a mockery of the principle that no man is above the law.\u201d Her voice\u00a0oozed\u00a0disdain, as when she mocked Roberts\u2019 references\u00a0to \u201cthe bold and unhesitating action\u201d required of an independent executive.\u00a0\u00a0 In one of her especially impassioned points, the senior liberal justice told spectators the majority had given Trump \u201call the immunity he asked for \u2013 and more.\u201d Among the guests in the court\u2019s VIP section near the bench was Jane Sullivan Roberts, wife of the chief justice. In the lawyers\u2019 section\u00a0sat Michael Dreeben,\u00a0the\u00a0Justice Department attorney who argued in April on behalf of Smith and will now, with the special counsel\u2019s team,\u00a0determine how to proceed. (Roberts and Dreeben have long been connected. Before becoming a judge, Roberts was an appellate attorney. In his first Supreme Court case, in January 1989, he happened to face Dreeben, then an assistant US solicitor general. Roberts won.) The case will return to US District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan, who earlier had rejected Trump\u2019s claim of immunity, to determine which of Trump\u2019s activities as he protested the 2020 election results might be deemed \u201cunofficial\u201d and subject to criminal liability. Trump had previously argued that virtually all his activities surrounding the 2020 election were \u201cofficial actions\u201d and shielded from criminal prosecution. Defensive of SCOTUS\u2019 handling of case As he deflected from Trump, the person who brought the case, Roberts insisted that broad presidential immunity protects \u201cthe institution of the Presidency,\u201d not an individual president. Still, subtly mingled with such assertions was\u00a0some\u00a0defensiveness about the court\u2019s handling of the Trump controversy. He said that the justices had \u201clittle pertinent precedent\u201d to guide their review of the case \u2013 \u201ca case that we \u2026 are deciding on an expedited basis, less than five months after we granted the Government\u2019s request\u201d to take\u00a0up the issue. But the majority in a\u00a0one-sentence order\u00a0last December rejected a request from Smith to hear the consequential immunity question sooner. The court\u00a0did not schedule oral arguments until late April. Earlier in December, Chutkan had ruled that Trump lacked any immunity from criminal prosecution. \u201cWhatever immunities a sitting President may enjoy, the United States has only one Chief Executive at a time, and that position does not confer a lifelong \u2018get-out-of-jail-free\u2019 pass,\u201d she wrote. The DC US Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, writing, \u201cFor the purpose of this criminal case, former President Trump has become citizen Trump, with all of the defenses of any other criminal defendant. But any executive immunity that may have protected him while he served as President no longer protects him against this prosecution.\u201d Endorsing that view, Sotomayor offered a reminder of how it all started. \u201cIn a last desperate ploy to hold onto power,\u201d she\u00a0wrote,\u00a0Trump \u201callegedly attempted to exploit the violence and chaos at the Capitol by pressuring lawmakers to delay the certification of the election and ultimately declare him the winner.

{"id": "2024_07_02_politics_supreme-court-grants-e-cigarrettes-fda-texas-porn", "text": "The Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to review the US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s strict regulations for e-cigarettes, a multibillion-dollar industry that has come under scrutiny for its popularity among young people. The court\u2019s decision means the justices will once again be tasked with assessing the federal agency\u2019s decisions and scientific expertise after they heard a case this term concerning the FDA\u2019s regulation of a key abortion drug. The high court also said it would hear a hear a lawsuit over Texas\u2019 age-verification requirements for sexually explicit web sites, granting an appeal from the adult entertainment industry challenging the prohibition on First Amendment grounds. Texas\u2019 law requires any website that publishes a substantial amount of content that is \u201charmful to minors\u201d to verify the age of users. The challengers said the law also forces adults to identify themselves before accessing pornography, which the group\u2019s lawyers said violates access to free speech online. The decisions to take or deny cases came a day after the Supreme Court handed down the final opinions of a contentious term, including the decision to grant sweeping immunity to former President Donald Trump. After the final opinions, the court issues what\u2019s known as a \u201cclean up\u201d conference list that provides insight into the next term that will begin in October. Many of the cases granted on Tuesday will likely be heard later this year or in early 2025. Spike in e-cigarette use amid health concerns Public health advocates have been sounding the alarm in recent years on a spike in vaping among young Americans. A study released last year found that an estimated 2.1 million children have used e-cigarettes regularly, and the majority use flavored products. Under the FDA\u2019s Premarket Tobacco Product Application pathway, companies must demonstrate that the marketing of a product would be appropriate for the protection of public health. When the FDA makes a decision about an e-cigarette product, it has to take into consideration the risk and benefit to the entire population, not just users of these products. The agency has denied applications for scores of products \u2013 namely ones that are flavored to taste like candy and desserts \u2013 prompting legal challenges from numerous e-cigarette makers. Lower courts are divided on whether the agency acted \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d in denying the applications, with several having sided against the e-cigarette makers. But the conservative 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the FDA earlier this year, saying the agency had sent manufactures on a \u201cwild goose chase\u201d in recent years to get approval for their products and that it acted \u201cunlawfully\u201d in denying applications from two e-cigarette makers. Those companies were attempting to get approval to market products with names like \u201cSuicide Bunny Mother\u2019s Milk and Cookies\u201d and \u201cIced Pineapple Express.\u201d The Biden administration told the justices that the 5th Circuit\u2019s ruling \u201chas far-reaching consequences for public health and threatens to undermine the Tobacco Control Act\u2019s central objective of \u2018ensuring that another generation of Americans does not become addicted to nicotine and tobacco products.\u2019\u201d \u201cFDA has never adopted a categorical ban on flavored e-cigarette products. Rather, it has recognized that, because such products pose a \u2018known and substantial risk to youth,\u2019 applicants bear a particularly high burden of proving \u2018a potential for benefit to adult smokers that could justify the risk,\u2019\u201d Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar told the justices in court papers. Porn restrictions face First Amendment challenge The challenge to the Texas law also comes from the 5th Circuit. A 2-1 panel in March allowed the law to go into effect, citing Texas\u2019 \u201clegitimate interest in preventing minors\u2019 access to pornography.\u201d A trade group representing the adult entertainment industry appealed to the Supreme Court in April. The group also requested that the justices temporarily\u00a0 block the law while the appeal continued \u2013 a request that was denied in April. There were no noted dissents. \u201cWhile purportedly seeking to limit minors\u2019 access to online sexual content, the act imposes significant burdens on adults\u2019 access to constitutionally protected expression,\u201d the industry, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, said in its appeal. The Supreme Court in 1997 unanimously invalidated provisions of a federal law intended to protect minors from indecent material online because it also imposed First Amendment burdens on adults. But in reviewing the Texas law, the 5th Circuit relied instead on a 1968 precedent in which the Supreme Court let stand a New York law barring the distribution of obscene material to minors. \u201cThe record is replete with examples of the sort of damage that access to pornography does to children,\u201d the appeals court wrote. \u201cBecause it is never obvious whether an internet user is an adult or a child, any attempt to identify the user will implicate adults in some way.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jen Christensen contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_07_02_politics_joe-biden-campaign-fundraising-june", "text": "The Biden campaign hauled in $127 million in the month of June, a strong showing after some signs that its fundraising was slowing \u2013 and a bright spot for the campaign after days of trying to beat back concerns about President Joe Biden\u2019s age and viability after his debate performance. June marked \u201cthe campaign\u2019s best month of the cycle,\u201d according to a news release, which noted that the campaign now has \u201c$240 million cash on hand \u2013 up from $212 million last month.\u201d In the days following the debate and amid intense criticism about Biden\u2019s faltering performance \u2013 along with questions about his continued political viability \u2013 Biden\u2019s campaign repeatedly pointed to good fundraising numbers as a signal of its grassroots strength. The argument is aimed at pushing back on those suggesting the president could lose support in the fallout from his performance. Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, campaign chair for Biden, told members of the campaign\u2019s National Finance Committee on Monday that the team is \u201cclear-eyed, not pollyannish,\u201d two participants on the call told CNN, but offered no indication Biden was reconsidering his bid for a second term. A virtual meeting with about 500 donors, whose pictures spread across 21 pages of Zoom screens, was called in hopes of easing the tensions and answering questions top Democrats have been raising in response to Biden\u2019s dismal debate night. O\u2019Malley Dillon suggested Biden\u2019s health was strong, the two sources said. She pointed to the president\u2019s health report released by his doctors earlier this year, with his doctor declaring him fit to serve. \u201cHe\u2019s probably in better health than most of us,\u201d O\u2019Malley Dillon said, according to the participants, one of whom said it was offensive and dismissive of the real concerns about Biden in the wake of his debate. A member of the National Finance Committee who participated in the call said it was disappointing that the top Biden official sought to downplay the concerns, rather than hear them. The campaign raised more than $33 million between Thursday and Sunday morning, according to a campaign official. And Thursday, the official said, was the campaign\u2019s best grassroots fundraising day to date. Biden\u2019s team has built a sizable war chest, which it has tapped for organizing and infrastructure in battleground states, along with significant spending on ads. There are more than 200 coordinated campaign offices with more than 1,000 staffers across battleground states, the campaign said. Nearly two-thirds of the $127 million raised in June, the campaign said, came from grassroots donations, with 95% of the campaign\u2019s donations this quarter under $200. Part of the total was fueled by a Los Angeles fundraiser featuring former President Barack Obama, George Clooney and Julia Roberts that brought in more than $30 million and the Bill and Hillary Clinton fundraiser in Virginia that brought in more than $8 million. Still, the debate has sparked new\u00a0Democratic donor anxiety that largely broke into three groups. Some argued against a pressure campaign urging the president to drop out, another group said party leaders should consider drastic steps only after the fallout from Thursday night is more closely examined, while a third group proactively called on Democrats to begin the process of seeking out a new nominee. Biden\u2019s campaign and its surrogates have sought to soothe the fallout from his debate performance, asking voters to consider the 90 minutes they saw him in the context of his three-and-a-half years in office. Sensing the political fragility of the moment, both Biden and his campaign have admitted he had an off night. Chris Korge, the Democratic National Committee\u2019s finance chair, used Monday\u2019s Zoom call to urge donors to work harder and unify behind Biden. \u201cEveryone just needs to breathe through the nose for a minute,\u201d Korge told donors, two participants on the call said, imploring donors not to panic about the trajectory of Biden\u2019s race with former President Donald Trump. Quentin Fulks, a deputy campaign manager, told donors that negative media coverage of Biden was to blame for any drop in the polls, rather than the president\u2019s debate performance. He said editorials and columnists calling for Biden to leave the race were \u201cblowing this out of proportion.\u201d But some top Democratic officials and supporters close to the White House have balked at the tone and language that campaign officials have taken as part of their defense. The decision by the campaign to refer to those who have called on Biden to drop out of the 2024 race as \u201cthe bedwetting brigade\u201d has fueled anger and dismay. One senior Democratic official told CNN that tone was \u201cdisrespectful.\u201d Another top Democrat in close touch with the White House said it was \u201cdisgusting.\u201d Multiple people taking issue with language like \u201cbedwetting\u201d told CNN that the tone is dismissive and wholly unappreciative of the very serious and widespread concerns inside the Democratic Party about whether Biden is fit to seek and carry out a second term. In one fundraising email over the weekend sent under the name of deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty, the campaign acknowledged the widespread panic that Biden\u2019s debate performance had caused. \u201cIf you\u2019re like me, you\u2019re getting lots of texts or calls from folks about the state of the race after Thursday. Maybe it was your panicked aunt, your MAGA uncle, or some self-important podcasters,\u201d the email started. Later, the message said: \u201cThe\u00a0bedwetting\u00a0brigade is calling for Joe Biden to \u2018drop out.\u2019 That is the best possible way for Donald Trump to win and us to lose.\u201d While the promising fundraising numbers come after one of the lowest points for Biden politically, they also come after a personal low for his opponent, who was convicted in late May on 34 felony counts. Biden\u2019s campaign suggested donors were energized by Trump\u2019s conviction. \u201cOur Q2 fundraising haul is a testament to the committed and growing base of supporters standing firmly behind the President and Vice President and clear evidence that our voters understand the choice in this election between President Biden fighting for the American people and Donald Trump fighting for himself as a convicted felon,\u201d Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement. Biden attended high-dollar fundraisers in New York City and East Hampton, New York, as well as Red Bank, New Jersey, over the weekend. June\u2019s performance comes after\u00a0two consecutive months\u00a0in which Trump\u2019s political operation outraised the Biden campaign, owing in part to a flood of donations after Trump\u2019s criminal conviction.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/politics/joe-biden-campaign-fundraising-june/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_politics_how-trump-avoided-another-trial", "text": "As last summer came to a close, the four criminal cases that had been brought against former President Donald Trump posed both extraordinary political peril as well as the very real threat that the 2024 Republican White House front-runner would be convicted by multiple juries before the first ballot was cast. What a difference a year made \u2013 or, perhaps more accurately, didn\u2019t make. With Monday\u2019s Supreme Court presidential immunity ruling likely preventing a trial in the federal election subversion case before the election, Trump is poised to avoid pre-election trials in the three most significant criminal prosecutions he faces. He was convicted in the fourth. But the hush money case brought by the Manhattan district attorney was widely viewed as the least serious and most tangential to the choice voters will make on November 5, as it used a controversial legal theory to target conduct that has been publicly known for nearly a decade. It is possible that he won\u2019t even receive prison time in the case. And in a longshot bid, a source told CNN that Trump\u2019s legal team filed a letter Monday seeking to challenge the former president\u2019s conviction in New York based on the high court\u2019s\u00a0ruling on presidential immunity. \u201cThe sad thing is, of the four, it\u2019s the one that feeds Trump\u2019s narrative of political persecution, which is tragic,\u201d said Ty Cobb, who served as Trump\u2019s White House lawyer during the special counsel Russia investigation but now opposes his reelection. \u201cI think that [narrative of political persecution], more than the conviction, will have a bigger effect on the election, which I\u2019m horrified about,\u201d Cobb said. Americans will go to the polls this fall without a verdict on whether Trump broke federal and state laws by seeking to overturn the 2020 election, or\u00a0whether his hoarding of sensitive government documents post-presidency violated national security statutes. November\u2019s election will not only select the country\u2019s next leader. It will determine Trump\u2019s legal fate. If elected, it\u2019s widely expected that Trump will make the federal prosecutions against him go away, either by ordering his attorney general to dismiss them or by pardoning himself. The Georgia election subversion case, meanwhile, is on hold while an appeals court considers a bid to kick Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis off the case, and the prosecution now faces other major hurdles. \u201cIf Donald Trump wins the election, no criminal trial of his will ever go forward,\u201d said Paul Rosenzweig, who worked for the Whitewater investigation into Bill Clinton and went on to serve as an official in the Department of Homeland Security. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t count on the criminal justice system to save us. The electoral system is what will define in the end how we do.\u201d Several factors contributed to Trump\u2019s apparent escape from criminal culpability before the election. The wheels of justice turn slowly, as the adage goes, but Trump benefited from legal perks and lucky breaks outside the reach of any other defendant. They included a well-financed legal strategy built around delay, missteps by his opponents, an almost unbelievable case assignment coincidence and now, a Supreme Court ruling that will delay and undermine what was the marquee case against the former president. \u201cThe law can very clearly be used as an instrument of justice and it can very clearly be used as an instrument of injustice,\u201d said Rep. Jamie Raskin, the Maryland Democrat who led the second House impeachment team against Trump. \u201cThe rules can be used to tie everybody up in knots and dilute the moral clarity of a situation or the rules can be used to illuminate the moral meaning of a situation,\u201d Raskin told CNN in an interview last week. A Supreme Court ruling that hamstrings the DC federal subversion case The charges by special counsel Jack Smith alleging Trump subverted the 2020 election was the second to last of the four cases brought. It broke significant legal ground and posed novel, gravely important legal questions Yet, it started off at the quickest pace \u2013 in no small part due to District Judge Tanya Chutkan\u2019s zero tolerance for lollygagging \u2013 and by the end of last year, it looked likely to be the first to reach a jury, with a trial scheduled for March. Smith sought to maintain that momentum last December by rushing to the Supreme Court the question that he said needed to be decided before trial: whether presidential immunity Trump claimed he had shielded him from the prosecution. But the Supreme Court did not go along with Smith\u2019s plans, first declining his request that the justices jump ahead of the usual appeals process that would first go to the DC Circuit Court. Once that appeals court issued its ruling rejecting wholesale Trump\u2019s sweeping claims, the high court put the case on pause this spring so that it could make the final decision. The justices\u2019 consideration of the case halted the pre-trial proceedings for four months, and now their Monday ruling stands likely to add many more months of litigation before a jury hears the charges. Even some of Trump\u2019s critics, however, have defended the court\u2019s handling of the matter, noting that by standards of the high court, the dispute did move on a fast track. \u201cYou can\u2019t charge a former president for a crime for the first time in history without going to Supreme Court,\u201d Cobb said. The DC Circuit deserves some blame for the delay, according to Cobb, as its ruling \u201cwas more of a body blow than a surgical assessment of the law.\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 opinion for the majority pointed specifically to the lack of \u201cfactual analysis\u201d by the lower courts to explain why another round of pre-trial proceedings would be necessary. More than just delaying the case, however, the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling will make the charges significantly harder to prove if the prosecution does reach a trial. The conservative majority did so by ruling that alleged conduct determined to be an \u201cofficial\u201d presidential act is not only subject to immunity but cannot be used as evidence to support the charges targeting Trump\u2019s unofficial conduct. \u201cA lot of the evidence that Smith had that indicates the criminality of what Trump was trying to do has now been declared off limits,\u201d said Rosenzweig, who signed on to a friend-of-the-court brief opposing Trump\u2019s arguments in the Supreme Court case. A Trump-appointed trial judge slow walks Smith\u2019s other case Compared to his first-of-its-kind election subversion case, Smith\u2019s classified documents charges against that Trump was, in theory, a simpler, cleaner-cut prosecution. The allegations that Trump unlawfully retained national defense information and then obstructed a federal investigation into the materials focus almost entirely on his conduct after leaving the White House. And much of the case resembles prosecutions brought routinely by the Justice Department against government officials who mishandle the nation\u2019s secrets. But Smith got a bad break in the south Florida judge who was handed the case, drawing in a random lottery Aileen Cannon, a young, inexperienced Trump appointee. She previously handled the lawsuit Trump brought challenging the FBI\u2019s search of Mar-a-Lago and was rebuked by a conservative appeals court for rulings that showed special treatment to the former president. In the criminal case, Cannon has taken months to rule on pre-trial disputes that legal experts say are not close calls. She\u2019s dragged out the proceedings by requiring days of hearings on Trump\u2019s longshot arguments. Even though she so far has rejected his efforts to toss the charges, she\u2019s hinted she\u2019d let him put in front of a jury his far-fetched and legally dubious claims about the case. Assuming Trump does not become president and make the case go away, it could take years before the charges reach trial. And Cannon\u2019s questionable handling of the case makes a messy appeal almost guaranteed. \u201cCannon\u2019s performance is historically perverse for a federal judge,\u201d Cobb said. Unforced error by Georgia prosecutor puts entire case at risk If the assignment of Cannon was an incredible moment of fortune for Trump, then an unforced error in judgment by Willis was a godsend. Her prosecution of Trump and 18 codefendants for their alleged interference in Georgia\u2019s 2020 election is now on indefinite hold while the Georgia Court of Appeals reviews ethical allegations against the prosecutor for her romantic relationship with her deputy. The appeals court could decide to disqualify Willis, a decision sources have told CNN would effectively kill the entire case. Willis and defenders say her affair with Nathan Wade, who served as her top prosecutor, was not a violation of ethical standards. Nonetheless, it may have cost her the prosecution and even those who cheered on her case say she should have exercised better judgment given the high stakes. As the only state election interference prosecution of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, it\u2019s a criminal case for which Trump could not pardon himself, even if reelected. After the trial judge said Willis could stay on the case as long as Wade got the boot, the defendants appealed that ruling and obtained a hold on the prosecution while the appeal plays out \u2013 a process that could take many months and has effectively ensured the case will not go to trial before November\u2019s election. The fallout from Willis\u2019s own actions \u2013 coupled with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on immunity \u2013 may mean that Trump never stands trial in Fulton County, regardless of whether he wins the 2024 election. If and when the trial court proceedings are allowed to restart, the trial judge, Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee will have to go through the same analysis on presidential immunity that the US Supreme Court is requiring in the federal election subversion case. That will likely throw a big wrench into the way the case was put together, according to CNN analyst Michael Moore, pointing to the Georgia anti-racketeering law that is the foundation of the prosecution. \u201cThe usual benefit of that charge is that each defendant can be held accountable for the bad acts of their co-defendants,\u201d said Moore, who was a US attorney in Georgia under President Barack Obama. But the new Supreme Court immunity standard jeopardizes the use of much of that conduct in the case. \u201cI think the case is likely toast as it relates to Trump,\u201d Moore said.

I think it was her polite way of getting me to shut up, but it\u2019s good advice even if her ultimate goal was a little quiet in the King family kitchen. Listening is a lost art in our politics. And, too often, in our political coverage. Everyday Americans are ignored, or given a quote or soundbite here and there, while most of the attention goes to the ever louder partisan bombast. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 we need to cover what the politicians say. And what their ads say. And fact check it all. But our All Over the Map project is an attempt to shift the balance a bit. To listen. To learn. We have been at it 10 months now, and we are learning a ton from voters who are literally all over the map \u2013 in every way. Now, with a presidential debate looming on Thursday and a consequential election heading into the final stretch, we invite you to listen with us \u2013 in a way that goes beyond what we can do on television or in written dispatches. All Over the Map, in podcast form, comes to CNN Audio today, so we can share our voters\u2019 stories in more detail. You can hear people wrestle with their choices and explain the life experiences shaping their politics. A CNN series that began in Iowa and New Hampshire as the primary season took off now includes voters in South Carolina, Virginia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada and Arizona. Mom was right. You learn when you listen. My biggest lesson so far: Yes, there are huge differences in polarized America. But voters are not only willing but eager to have the tough conversations many politicians avoid. Most are willing to discuss the compromises politicians refuse to make. Economic anxiety is easy to find, as are doubts about the candidates. In our first episode, Nikki Haley voters share their thoughts, and their frustrations, with their two choices for president. There are enough supporters of the former South Carolina governor, who ended her GOP primary bid in March, to swing the election \u2013 so we wanted to visit a few in battleground Pennsylvania ahead of the first Biden-Trump debate. You will meet Linda Rooney and Michael Pesce and you will hear the torment of self-identified Reagan Republicans who want their party back from Trump but run afoul of their GOP DNA when they ponder voting to reelect a Democratic president. It is fascinating to listen to voters who start in the same place but take different turns when staring at the Trump-Biden crossroads. Rooney, from Media, Pennsylvania, in the Philadelphia suburbs, gives voice to a theme we hear a ton in our travels. She voted for Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020. \u201cI\u2019m sad that we only have these two choices honestly,\u201d Rooney told us. \u201cI\u2019m tired of celebrities sort of being in politics. I don\u2019t like Trump, but I have to say we were, for us, personally, we were better off when he was president. I don\u2019t like how he\u2019s so unreliable in some ways. You never know what he\u2019s going to do next. I just want a normal person. Like, I just want someone normal. I don\u2019t want a celebrity, and I don\u2019t have confidence in Biden. So, I feel like I don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d But she promised to vote, and it is not lost on her that the Pennsylvania winner tends to be the national winner. Pesce is both part of the generation that changed American politics 40 years ago and the suburban shift that is reshaping our politics today. He lives in Doylestown, in competitive Bucks County, and, like Rooney, was a Trump voter in 2016 and a Biden voter in 2020. \u201cI became a Republican when I turned 18 because of Ronald Reagan,\u201d said Pesce, a Coast Guard veteran who works in a meat processing plant. \u201cI\u2019m a Reagan Republican. I like that version of conservatism. I like that version of America. His version of \u2018America First.\u2019 That we are the leaders of the free world. We are the leaders of the world military. This is what we stand for. And I\u2019m like, yeah, that\u2019s what I want to be.\u201d Down the road, we visit one of America\u2019s newest presidential battlegrounds and meet two voters whose 2024 choices \u2013 and conversations \u2013 are shaped by Biden\u2019s map-changing 2020 win in Georgia. And we explore the cracks in the Biden coalition that make his reelection math, and map, so challenging. A Palestinian American law school student in Dearborn, Michigan, gives voice to the anger young voters and Arab American voters feel over Biden\u2019s handling of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. A Black entrepreneur in Milwaukee shares his take on the economic decline in neighborhoods that once offered a path to the middle class through factory jobs. I hope you will consider joining our journey. A few minutes into any voter conversation, you might feel no connection to someone who lives far away from you and perhaps has a very different life experience or political views. My bet, though, is by the end, something will connect you or stir your own thoughts about an issue or the candidates. We are just a bit over four months to Election Day now, and we know that the race is close, that the third-party candidates make the state-by-state math complicated and that voters who don\u2019t much like either major-party candidate will decide who wins. Maybe you fit in this group. Maybe you are certain about your choice and can\u2019t understand that frustration. I hope you can share a little time with us, and learn by listening.

{"id": "2024_07_01_politics_presidents-immunity-supreme-court-what-matters", "text": "With its immunity ruling on Monday, the Supreme Court granted former President Donald Trump\u2019s wish of all but guaranteeing that his criminal trial for trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election will not go to trial before the 2024 election in November. It also granted presidents in general a definitive \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d from prosecution for core official acts and said presidents should be presumed immune for a much more expansive list of acts. In the view of the majority comprised of the six conservative justices on the court, the decision does not place presidents in general, and Trump in particular, above the law. But the three liberals dissented with a warning about how elevating a president will affect American democracy. The decision has the near-term result of delaying Trump\u2019s trial while a court in Washington, DC, considers which criminal activity that Trump is accused of can be considered \u201cunofficial.\u201d It also has the long-term effect of placing presidents in a different system of justice than other Americans. Here are key lines from a landmark ruling: What is this new immunity? Chief Justice John Roberts explains it in the majority opinion as including absolute immunity for some actions and a presumption of immunity for others. Why does a president need this immunity? So that he can act boldly as president and take actions without fear of later prosecution clouding his judgement, according to the court. Here\u2019s Roberts: What does it say in the Constitution about presidents getting special immunity? Nothing. But that\u2019s no problem, according to Roberts. How far does this immunity extend? A president gets \u201cat least a presumptive immunity\u201d even for acts \u201cwithin the outer perimeter of his official responsibility,\u201d according to the court. But it\u2019s careful to add that he gets no immunity for \u201cunofficial acts\u201d \u2013 and despite the broad reach of the immunity, the court argues presidents are still accountable. Are any of the things Trump is accused of in special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s indictment outside this blanket of immunity? During oral arguments in the case back in April, Trump\u2019s attorney, John Sauer, told Justice Amy Coney Barrett that multiple elements of the indictment would indeed be \u201cprivate,\u201d or unofficial, acts. These include, for instance, getting an outside attorney to organize slates of false electors. Barrett, in a concurring opinion on Monday, said she would make clear in the decision what was official versus unofficial. But the majority takes no position and wants the trial court to go through the allegations individually. Trump can then appeal whatever the trial court decides. Here\u2019s Roberts: Does the majority tell the trial court what might be official or not? The majority gives quite a bit of detail. Trump has \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d for any instructions or pressure he exerted on his acting attorney general, for instance. Plus, the court won\u2019t allow as evidence any interviews with people who worked in the administration (nullifying much of the evidence gathered by the House select committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, events). And it also won\u2019t let a court consider a president\u2019s motives for taking an action. It\u2019s an open question for the lower court to decide if Trump\u2019s pressure on then-Vice President Mike Pence to disregard the 2020 election results involved \u201cofficial conduct,\u201d but the Supreme Court put that pressure in the \u201cpresumptively immune\u201d category. The majority thinks Trump\u2019s tweets encouraging people to go to the Capitol and pressure Pence are within the \u201couter perimeter of his official responsibilities,\u201d but they\u2019re not sure and they expect it will be challenging for the lower court to muddle through these questions. Why can\u2019t a jury make these decisions? Juries can\u2019t even consider official acts in terms of a prosecution, according to the Supreme Court. So the Supreme Court gave Trump everything he wanted? It certainly embraced Trump\u2019s theory of immunity and pretty much guaranteed the trial will not happen before the election, although the majority says they were restrained since they rejected his request to completely dismiss the case. So there is a special system of justice for presidents? The president is more than a person, according to Roberts. The majority dismisses warnings about a president operating above the laws as \u201cfear mongering on the basis of extreme hypotheticals.\u201d It\u2019s more important to protect the president from political prosecutions, the court says. Roberts borrows from Trump\u2019s attorneys when he quotes George Washington\u2019s farewell address, in which he warns about factions. The problem with that particular quote, as I found earlier this year, is that Washington also warned about elevating a person above the law. Does the court mention the politics of today? Roberts says the court\u2019s considerations are more far-reaching than what\u2019s happening at the moment. Did it say anything about Smith? The majority did not weigh in on the brewing argument among conservatives that Smith should not even have a job and that his role as a special counsel is unconstitutional. But Justice Clarence Thomas endorsed the idea in a concurring opinion. What did Barrett say about alternate electors? Barrett, a Trump appointee, wrote her own concurrence in which she disagreed with the majority on some key points. She said they could easily have expressed that some of Trump\u2019s conduct was unofficial. What was in the blistering dissent? Writing for the three liberals on the court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor blasted the majority as inventing an \u201catextual, ahistorical, and unjustifiable immunity that puts the President above the law.\u201d She said the court makes it difficult to imagine what might be \u201cunofficial\u201d conduct on the part of the president. The majority \u201cpays lip service\u201d to the idea that presidents are not above the law \u201cbut it then proceeds to place former Presidents beyond the reach of the federal criminal laws for any abuse of official power.\u201d How far does Sotomayor say presidents can now go? As far as they want, she says.

{"id": "2024_06_24_politics_fact-check-trump-george-washington-slaves", "text": "Former President Donald Trump delivered another litany of false claims during two speeches on Saturday. And he expressed an opinion on American history that is clearly contradicted by the facts. During a speech to the Faith\u00a0and\u00a0Freedom\u00a0Coalition, a conservative Christian group,\u00a0Trump criticized proposals to change the names of schools, military facilities and other places that honor slaveowners and Confederate leaders. (Under President Joe Biden, the Army has renamed nine installations\u00a0that had been named for Confederate generals.) And Trump said, \u201cHow about George Washington high school? \u2018We want the name removed from that high school.\u2019 They don\u2019t know why. You know, they thought he had slaves. Actually I think he probably didn\u2019t.\u2019\u201d Facts First: Washington owned slaves. This is an extensively documented fact. At the time of Washington\u2019s death in 1799, there were 317 enslaved people at Mount Vernon, his home and plantation in Virginia, including 123 people owned by Washington himself.\u00a0 \u201cGeorge Washington owned slaves. We know this by his own hand. He kept ledgers on everyone he enslaved,\u201d said Alexis Coe, a senior fellow at the think tank New America and author of \u201cYou Never Forget Your First: A Biography of George Washington.\u201d Coe said it is \u201creprehensible, on a personal level, to deny such a thing\u201d and also \u201cdangerous to our country\u201d to have a leading presidential candidate espousing such inaccurate views on US history. The website for Mount Vernon, which is now maintained as a historic place, says\u00a0that the number of slaves at the property \u201cgrew steadily\u201d over Washington\u2019s time there from 1754 to 1799. Washington inherited 10 slaves from his father at age 11. The Mount Vernon website notes that \u201cas a young man, Washington purchased dozens of enslaved people from estate sales and in private transactions\u201d \u2013 and that the first US president also rented slaves from others, inherited them from siblings, and enslaved the children who were born to slaves at Mount Vernon. When he married his wife Martha, the website notes, he also gained control of \u201ca large number\u201d of enslaved people from the estate of her first husband. The\u00a0list\u00a0of\u00a0317 enslaved people at Mount Vernon at the time of his death included 41 people rented from other plantations and 153 people from Martha\u2019s first husband\u2019s estate. Washington privately struggled\u00a0with the idea of slavery and, in the last two decades of his life, expressed private support for the idea of abolishing slavery by legislation. But when he died, he immediately freed just one person in his will, his longtime manservant, and decreed that the other slaves he owned would be freed upon the death of his wife Martha. She ended up signing a deed to free all of his remaining slaves the year after his death, but she kept the slaves she had inherited herself. Trump made many other false claims Here are just some of the other false claims Trump made in the speech to the Christian conservative group or in his rally speech Saturday night\u00a0in Philadelphia: - Trump claimed Democrats rigged the 2020 presidential election, his usual debunked lie. - Trump claimed \u201cevery legal scholar\u201d wanted Roe v. Wade overturned and the power to set abortion policy returned to individual states, which is not true. - Trump claimed \u201cjust about all the Democrats\u201d also wanted Roe overturned and abortion policy set by states, though Democrats overwhelmingly supported the preservation of Roe. - Trump claimed \u201cthere are states that allow\u201d the execution of babies after birth, though that is illegal in every state.  - Trump claimed that the US has record inflation, though the current inflation rate, 3.3% in May, is nowhere near the US record (23.7% in 1920) or even the 40-year high (9.1%) that was hit in June 2022. - Trump claimed the price of bacon has increased 100% or more under Biden, though the Biden-era increase is actually about 17% as of May. - Trump claimed Biden was the person who indicted him in the New York criminal case in which he was convicted on 34 felony counts, though a grand jury of ordinary citizens indicted him and the prosecution was led by a local district attorney who does not report to the federal government. - Trump claimed the global prison population is \u201cway down\u201d under Biden because foreign leaders are emptying their detention facilities to send people to the US as migrants. But the global prison population is actually up since 2021, and there is no proof of Trump\u2019s repeated claim about foreign leaders\u2019 actions. - Trump claimed crime in Venezuela is down 72%, though the limited available numbers show a much smaller decline of about 26%. - Trump claimed crime in the US is \u201cso much up,\u201d though preliminary statistics show US crime dropped significantly in 2023 and again in the first quarter of 2024. - Trump claimed he has been indicted more than notorious gangster Al Capone, though Capone was actually indicted more than Trump. - Trump claimed China paid the entire cost of his tariffs on imported Chinese goods and that \u201cthe American people didn\u2019t pay for it at all,\u201d though study\u00a0after\u00a0study has found that Americans paid the overwhelming majority of the cost of the tariffs. - Trump claimed the Biden administration is trying to require Army tanks to be all-electric, though the military\u2019s move toward electric vehicles does not include tanks. - Trump told a story in which he claimed someone told him that non-electric trucks do not have to stop when driving from New York to Los Angeles, though they do.\u00a0", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/politics/fact-check-trump-george-washington-slaves/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_04_28_politics_state-abortion-ballot-measure-vote-dg", "text": "This November, many voters across the country could take to the polls to determine the future of abortion access in their state, with organizers working to secure a wave of measures on the 2024 ballot aimed at restoring or protecting the right to an abortion \u2013 and a few aimed at restricting it. Abortion rights advocates hope the effort will restore the issue of reproductive health access to the people, after the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, eliminating the national right to an abortion. Most of the proposed ballot measures aim to enshrine the right to an abortion in state constitutions.\u00a0They follow a series of restrictive trigger laws that went into effect following the Dobbs decision, along with abortion policies that were handed down by politicians or decided by state supreme courts since the decision. Some are up against a handful of counter measures aimed at restricting abortion access, though similar restrictive measures have failed in the few states where votes have been held in the past couple of years. Abortion measures on the ballot in November Six states \u2014\u00a0Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Nevada, New York and South Dakota \u2014 have already secured abortion measures on the 2024 ballot. All eyes are on Florida, which has served as a critical access point for people seeking services in a region of the country that is fast becoming an abortion care desert. A six-week abortion ban replaced the state\u2019s 15-week ban on May 1. After organizers secured the New York Equal Rights Amendment on the 2024 ballot, it was briefly struck from the ballot by a state judge. State Attorney General Letitia James appealed that decision, and a state appeals court restored the measure to the ballot in June. States with potential abortion ballot measures Organizers in other states across the country are working to secure funding, gather signatures and jump through the legal hoops necessary to secure abortion measures on the 2024 ballot. In most states, the process entails collecting a certain number of signatures by a designated deadline this summer, while others require the additional step of having the ballot language approved by a state court, according to campaign organizers. The abortion rights measures are largely backed by coalitions of reproductive health advocates, many of which are fundraising to secure the money to support the campaigns. Arizona and Montana have seen proposed measures protecting abortion access up to the point of viability, which doctors say is around 24 weeks into pregnancy. A potential measure in Arkansas would allow abortion up to 20 weeks into pregnancy or in cases of rape, incest or fatal fetal anomalies. A potential measure in Missouri\u00a0that\u00a0seeks to broadly protect reproductive care\u00a0could still make the ballot in November.\u00a0An opposing\u00a0measure to permanently ban abortion,\u00a0however,\u00a0never made it out of the state\u2019s legislative session. A number of potential measures, like those in Arkansas and Montana, allow for abortion past the point of viability when deemed necessary by a doctor to protect a pregnant person\u2019s life or health \u2014 though doctors and lawmakers have struggled to define exactly what type of medical emergencies would be allowed under the exception. A proposed measure to restrict abortion access in Pennsylvania seeks to establish that public funding can\u2019t be used for the procedure, though it is unlikely to pass the state legislature. States that have voted on abortion post-Dobbs Seven states have already seen a vote on abortion access since Roe v. Wade was overturned, and reproductive health advocates have been heartened by the overwhelming support for abortion access among voters. Every measure aimed at protecting abortion access has passed, while all measures to restrict it have failed. While support for abortion access is considered a given in states like California, organizers say these votes offer an important layer of legal protection for patients and providers \u2013 and send a message to elected officials about what voters want.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/28/politics/state-abortion-ballot-measure-vote-dg/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_politics_trump-challenge-hush-money-verdict-immunity-supreme-court", "text": "Donald\u00a0Trump\u2019s legal team filed a letter Monday seeking to challenge the former president\u2019s conviction in his New York criminal hush money trial based on the US Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity, a source told CNN. Just hours after the high court ruling, Trump\u2019s lawyer filed a letter with Judge Juan\u00a0Merchan seeking permission to file a motion to challenge the verdict, the source said. If the judge allows Trump to file the motion it could delay Trump\u2019s sentencing \u2013 set for next week \u2013 to allow the parties to brief the issue. The longshot bid to challenge Trump\u2019s New York conviction follows the Supreme Court decision that presidents have an absolute immunity\u00a0from prosecution for core official acts. It comes as the 2024 Republican presumptive presidential nominee seeks to avoid other pre-election trials in the three most significant criminal prosecutions he faces. In the letter, Trump\u2019s legal team cited the Supreme Court\u2019s decision and suggested postponing his sentencing next week, a source familiar with the effort told CNN. The former president\u2019s lawyers argued that the ruling confirmed their position that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg should not have been allowed to offer evidence at the trial regarding Trump\u2019s \u201cofficial acts\u201d and, as a result, the jury\u2019s guilty verdict should be set aside. The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office\u00a0did not file its sentencing submission Monday as expected, according to a separate source. The district attorney\u2019s office declined to comment on the letter Monday night. Will Scharf, an attorney who represents Trump in the immunity case, told CNN Monday night the high court\u2019s ruling \u201cabsolutely\u201d impacts the hush money case. \u201cThe Supreme Court was very clear that for acts that fall within the outer perimeter of the president\u2019s official responsibilities, acts that are presumptively immune from prosecution, that evidence of those acts cannot be used to try essentially private acts,\u201d he said on \u201cThe Source.\u201d Scharf said that Bragg\u2019s case used a \u201csubstantial number of official acts of the presidency\u201d as evidence, and therefore, \u201cwe believe that corrupts that trial, that that indicates that that jury verdict needs to be overturned and, at the very least, we deserve a new trial where those immune acts will not come into evidence, as the Supreme Court dictated today.\u201d He pointed to communications made through official White House communication channels and posts from Trump\u2019s official Twitter account as falling \u201cneatly within the outer perimeter of a president\u2019s official responsibilities and duties,\u201d and thus \u201cnot admissible as evidence in that New York trial.\u201d The Supreme Court, in the 6-3 decision that split along ideological lines, ruled that Trump may claim immunity from criminal prosecution for some of the actions he took as president before leaving office, likely delaying cases \u2013 like his federal election subversion trial related to his actions on January 6, 2021 \u2013 even further. Trump became the first former US president to be convicted of a felony in May when the Manhattan jury found him guilty of all 34 counts of falsifying business records\u00a0in his\u00a0hush money criminal trial. Trump\u2019s sentence is up to the judge, and it could include prison time or probation. Merchan set that sentencing hearing for July 11.

{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_key-lines-cnn-debate-what-matters", "text": "In CNN\u2019s presidential debate, President Joe Biden was halting and, at times, trailed off and confused words, feeding a nagging narrative about his fitness for the presidency. Former President Donald Trump refused to answer simple questions about accepting election results and repeatedly overinflated his record, confirming concerns about the chaos his potential victory in November could create. Insults over policy Given the opportunity to answer questions about policy, like how to lower the staggering cost of child care, the men engaged in a back-and-forth about whether presidential scholars think Trump was the worst president in history. Biden called Trump a \u201cwhiner.\u201d Trump said Biden, \u201clike so many politicians \u2026 is just a complainer.\u201d Later, a question about whether either of the elderly men is fit to lead the country turned into a dispute about who is the better golfer. Trump said Biden couldn\u2019t drive a golf ball 50 yards, and Biden challenged Trump to a golf match but only if Trump carries his own clubs. It was that kind of night. It is difficult to include detailed quotes about their policy statements, Trump\u2019s in particular, because they were so misleading. Read CNN\u2019s full fact check. Here\u2019s a look at some of the lines that stood out: On the economy CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, who moderated the debate in Atlanta with Dana Bash, noted the well-documented angst in the country about the economy and asked Biden what he\u2019d say to people who feel they\u2019re worse off on his watch. Trump, as he frequently does on a range of issues, embellished the facts in his response by saying that the economy he oversaw was the best in history until the Covid-19 pandemic. Trump repeatedly tried to blame inflation entirely on Biden. Biden argued inflation was not an issue four years ago because the economy was in such bad shape. When Biden trailed off The president was making a point about the tax cuts, enacted by Trump, which have helped grow the national debt. Biden was trying explain that he supports tax increases on the wealthiest Americans to pay for many social goals, but the words got jumbled. It was an awkward moment since it was not clear what Biden meant. Trump was quick with a misleading response. That\u2019s misleading since Medicare and Social Security also need more younger workers paying into them to cover the costs of older workers currently looking toward retirement. On abortion rights Trump said \u201ceverybody\u201d wanted Roe v. Wade overturned, which is not at all true since opinion polls suggested most Americans wanted it kept in place. Not in Trump\u2019s telling. Trump also misread the divided politics of abortion rights at the moment, in which voters in some states are protecting abortion rights and legislatures in other states are curtailing them. Voters, given the opportunity, have generally tried to protect abortion rights. That\u2019s hardly a picture of unity. Trump then said some incorrect things about late-term abortions under Roe v. Wade before trying to end on a high note. Biden clearly disagreed and argued allowing states to each have completely different abortion policies is like allowing states to have completely different civil rights laws. But on an issue that Democrats hope will unify voters against Trump and Republicans, Biden offered one of his least coherent answers. Instead, apparently trying to make a point about the need for abortion access for people who have been raped, the president fed Trump\u2019s flawed narrative about migrant crime. Try to follow this: On immigration This a top issue for Trump, and he kept returning to it, arguing the country was safer under him. Biden noted there\u2019s no evidence to support these broad claims about people seeking asylum in the US from other parts of the world and said Trump was lying. These are claims Trump frequently repeats. In a new riff at the debate as he tries to siphon African American support from Democrats, Trump said an influx of migrants at the border were \u201ctaking Black jobs.\u201d Biden argued voters should trust him on immigration since he tried to get a bipartisan agreement passed in Congress to give the president new powers to address an influx of migrants, cut down on the flow of drugs and give new money to border patrol and immigration courts. Biden also pointed out Trump\u2019s policy of intentional family separation during a portion of his presidency. On veterans Biden turned from the immigration debate to his treatment of veterans, pointing out he signed legislation to expand care for veterans exposed to burn pits and toxic substances. He mentioned his late son, Beau, who died of cancer years after serving in Iraq. And Biden repeated a story told by Trump\u2019s former White House chief staff, retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, that Trump declined to visit a World War I cemetery in France because he thought people who fought in wars were \u201csuckers.\u201d Biden\u2019s description of this anecdote seemed to anger Trump. The former president kept coming back to it, disputing it throughout the debate. On Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine Trump, when pressed, said Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s demand to keep territory in Ukraine to end the war was unacceptable. But he also said the US is spending too much money helping Ukraine. Those separate points led Trump to make a bold claim. Biden noted the aid to Ukraine is mostly in the form of weapons, which are manufactured in the US. He also said Putin\u2019s goal is to reconstitute the Soviet Union. Putin will not stop at Ukraine, Biden said. There\u2019s not a way to verify this, of course. And Trump has a history of making bold claims that do not become true. On Israel and Gaza Biden said he will continue to push for a peace plan that has been endorsed by Israel and other countries but rejected by Hamas. He will also, he said, both support Israel and try to moderate the war when it comes to urban areas. Trump said he would not pressure Israel to moderate its actions. Biden, who describes himself as a Zionist and who has largely stood up to progressive Democrats who want him to more forcefully condemn Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza, said Trump had it wrong. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard so much foolishness,\u201d Biden said. When Trump was asked if he supported the creation of a Palestinian state, he would not directly answer, but instead complained about US foreign aid. \u201cWe\u2019re paying everybody\u2019s bills,\u201d Trump said. On protecting democracy Trump was asked by Tapper what he\u2019d say to voters who worry he violated his oath to uphold the Constitution on January 6, 2021, with his actions and inactions, and who worry that he\u2019ll do it again. He pointedly did not answer the question, but said this instead: Biden said Trump deserves blame for watching the riot at the Capitol unfold for hours without doing anything to intervene. On political retribution Trump was asked what he means by saying, after his conviction in a New York courtroom, that he\u2019d have every right to go after his political opponents. But then, after pointing out Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, was also recently convicted of a crime, Trump dialed back up on the idea of using the justice system against Biden. To which Biden said presidents should not be using the justice system in that way. Biden also\u00a0went into more salacious territory, listing off Trump\u2019s civil penalties for \u201cmolesting a woman in public.\u201d Actually, Trump was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation after the former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll accused him of raping her in a department store dressing room. Biden also referenced Stormy Daniels \u2013 he referred to her as a \u201cporn star\u201d \u2013 who said she had an affair with Trump. Trump denied the affair with Daniels before attacking his criminal conviction in New York for hiding reimbursements to his then-attorney for hush money payments to Daniels before the 2016 election. The prosecution helped his polling and his fundraising \u201cbecause the public knows it\u2019s a scam,\u201d Trump said. On Hitler Biden said he initially ran for president in 2020 because of the deadly White nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, after which Trump said there were \u201cfine people\u201d on both sides. That was another reference to Kelly\u2019s recollection of Trump\u2019s comments. Trump, meanwhile, disputed Biden\u2019s own reason for running for president. On climate change Trump didn\u2019t actually acknowledge that climate change is a thing, but said that when he was president there was clean air and water. Trump\u2019s broad and unprovable comment almost seemed to flabbergast Biden, who stumbled over words in pointing out that on his watch, Democrats passed legislation to address climate change, which is an existential threat to people. On who is the worst president The question from Tapper was about the cost of child care, but the answers turned to who is a worse president. On golf Bash asked about Trump\u2019s age and his capabilities to serve, and his answer went from cognitive tests, which he claimed to have aced, to golf, where he claimed to be winning recent tournaments.  Biden also bragged about his golf game, saying he had close to a six handicap before correcting himself to saying it was, at one point, an eight. On accepting election results Trump repeatedly deflected when asked if he would accept the election results, finally settling on \u201cif it\u2019s a fair and legal and good election,\u201d before suggesting, again, that fraud kept him from the White House in 2020.

{"id": "2024_07_01_politics_jen-omalley-dillon-donor-call", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign chair on Monday told members of the campaign\u2019s National Finance Committee that the team is \u201cclear-eyed, not pollyannish\u201d after the president\u2019s poor debate performance, two participants on the call told CNN,\u00a0but\u00a0defended Biden\u2019s health and\u00a0offered no indication\u00a0he\u00a0was reconsidering his bid for a second term. Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon held the virtual meeting with about 500 donors, whose pictures spread across 21 pages of Zoom screens. The meeting was called in hopes of easing the tensions and answering questions top Democrats have been raised in response to Biden\u2019s dismal debate performance Thursday night. Dillon offered no indication that Biden was considering changing course,\u00a0three participants on the call told CNN,\u00a0as she offered a staunch defense of his health.\u00a0She pointed to the president\u2019s health report released by his doctors earlier this year, which declared him fit to serve. \u201cHe\u2019s probably in better health than most of us,\u201d Dillon said, according to\u00a0two of the\u00a0participants, one of whom said\u00a0the\u00a0comments were\u00a0offensive and dismissive of the real concerns about Biden in the wake of his debate performance. A member of the National Finance Committee who participated in the call said it was disappointing that the top Biden official sought to downplay the concerns, rather than hear them. Questions were allowed, but they were read by staff members, rather than donors themselves. Among the questions that O\u2019Malley Dillon fielded was how Biden would do better in the next debate and what the campaign plans to do if the president dips in the polls, another donor on the call said. The main gist of the response regarding Biden\u2019s second debate against Donald Trump was that the campaign fully acknowledges the president had a bad performance, and that the president will be better prepared next time to turn it back onto Trump, per this donor. As for what happens if Biden falls in public polls, campaign officials stressed they are not concerned about that because their own internal polling was strong, and that Biden has been flat since the debate. Meanwhile,\u00a0some\u00a0top Democratic officials and supporters close to the White House have balked at the tone and language that some campaign officials have taken as part of their defense as the campaign has dug in after the debate. In particular, the decision by the campaign to refer to those who have called on Biden to drop out of the 2024 race because of their grave concerns after the CNN debate as \u201cthe bedwetting brigade\u201d has fueled anger and dismay.\u00a0One senior Democratic official told CNN that tone was \u201cdisrespectful\u201d; another top Democrat in close touch with the White House said it was \u201cdisgusting.\u201d Multiple people taking issue with language like \u201cbedwetting\u201d told CNN that the tone is dismissive and wholly unappreciative of the very serious and widespread concerns inside the Democratic Party about whether Biden is fit to seek and carry out a second term.\u00a0In one fundraising email over the weekend sent under the name of deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty, the campaign acknowledged the widespread panic that Biden\u2019s debate performance had caused. \u201cIf you\u2019re like me, you\u2019re getting lots of texts or calls from folks about the state of the race after Thursday. Maybe it was your panicked aunt, your MAGA uncle, or some self-important Podcasters,\u201d the email started. Later, the message said: \u201cThe\u00a0bedwetting\u00a0brigade is calling for Joe Biden to \u2018drop out.\u2019 That is the best possible way for Donald Trump to win and us to lose.\u201d In Monday\u2019s call\u00a0with donors, Chris Korge, the party\u2019s finance chair, urged donors to work harder and unify behind Biden. \u201cEveryone just needs to breathe through the nose for a minute,\u201d Korge told donors, two participants on the call said, imploring donors not to panic about the trajectory of Biden\u2019s race with Trump. Quentin Folks, a deputy campaign manager, told donors that negative media coverage of Biden was to blame for any drop in the polls, rather than the president\u2019s debate performance. He said editorials and columnists calling for Biden to leave the race were \u201cblowing this out of proportion.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/politics/jen-omalley-dillon-donor-call/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_politics_democrats-down-ballot-debate-fallout-biden", "text": "Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey, a Democrat whose seat is crucial to maintaining his party\u2019s slim Senate majority in November, faced a new attack ad Sunday from GOP challenger Dave McCormick\u2019s campaign \u2014 one that Republicans across the country could emulate. Casey, the McCormick ad claims, knew of President Joe Biden\u2019s status, and stood by the president anyway. The 35-second video features clips of Democratic operatives lamenting Biden\u2019s poor debate performance against former President Donald Trump last week \u2014 and then features Casey publicly proclaiming that Biden is up for the job if he wins a second term. It ends with text across the screen: \u201cWhen will Casey finally tell the truth?\u201d Casey, campaigning in Scranton on Monday, stood by Biden. \u201cHe had a bad night and debate, but I think people know what\u2019s at stake,\u201d he told reporters. The McCormick video was an early glimpse at a new strategy House and Senate Republican groups have started to deploy as the consequences of the president\u2019s shaky debate performance ripple through House, Senate and governor\u2019s races across the country. Republicans are eager to turn the 81-year-old president\u2019s struggles into an anvil, while Democrats gingerly navigate the most precarious moment to date in their bid to maintain control of the Senate and flip the GOP\u2019s slim House majority this fall. In the aftermath of Biden\u2019s Thursday night debacle, Democratic members of Congress have largely stood behind the president in public. That could change \u2013 very quickly \u2013 if post-debate polling and research show that Biden\u2019s debate fallout is likely to cost Democrats the House come November. On CNN Tuesday morning, Rep. Mike Quigley, signaling an openness to replacing Biden at the top of the ticket, said, \u201cwe have to be honest with ourselves that it wasn\u2019t just a horrible night.\u201d Another Democratic congressman, who only agreed to speak anonymously, told CNN:\u201cThe firewall is Congress. We need to have one of the bodies.\u201d This lawmaker said he and his colleagues would feel compelled to speak out \u2013 in a way they have not so far \u2013 and call on Biden to drop out if data comes out that shows: \u201cShit, he\u2019s not just going to lose the presidency, but he\u2019s going to lose the House.\u201d As CNN has reported, Biden and his team have been collecting and awaiting data \u2013 both anecdotal and public polling \u2013 as well as bracing for a broader round of Democratic campaign polling and research to get a clearer sense of the post-debate damage. \u201cHouse races have always been about the strength of our candidates, combined with the fact that Democrats deliver when in charge while extreme Republicans sow chaos,\u201d said Viet Shelton, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s why recent polling has been showing Democrats outrunning their Republican opponents across the battleground. That hasn\u2019t changed after the debate.\u201d If the dam is still holding among Democratic lawmakers who have declined to publicly call on Biden to leave the race, then privately, elected officials \u2013 everyone from leadership to the rank-and-file members of Congress \u2013 are actively discussing a range of \u201cwhat ifs\u201d, sources said. In private chats, lawmakers are discussing familiar Democratic names like Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and others as possible replacements for Biden. They are also intensely sensitive about outright dismissing Vice President Kamala Harris, and the anger that the scenario of passing over the country\u2019s first Black female vice president would unleash. Those floated prospects have been sensitive about being seen as publicly nudging Biden to exit the 2024 race. Whitmer on Monday pushed back on a Politico report that she\u2019d told Biden campaign co-chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon that Biden could no longer win Michigan \u2014 a must-win swing state for Democrats. \u201cAnyone who claims I would say that we can\u2019t win Michigan is full of shit,\u201d Whitmer said on X. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a two-term Democrat in a deep-red state whose name is also in the mix of potential replacements and future presidential contenders, told reporters in his home state Monday that Biden\u2019s performance in the debate was \u201crough\u201d \u2013 but insisted that he still backed the president. \u201cIt was a very bad night for the president,\u201d Beshear said. \u201cBut he is still the candidate. Only he can make decisions about his future candidacy. So as long as he continues to be in the race, I support him.\u201d Republicans on the attack The National Republican Senatorial Committee posted a video on social media interspersing endangered Democratic incumbents\u2019 comments supporting Biden with some of the president\u2019s worst moments in the debate. \u201cDemocrats 2024: Don\u2019t believe your lying eyes,\u201d the Senate GOP campaign arm said in a post accompanying the video. Jack Pandol, the communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said in a memo Monday that the House GOP\u2019s campaign arm\u00a0is preparing to take aim at Democrats \u201cfor gaslighting their own voters and refusing to take responsibility for the crisis the country now finds itself in.\u201d The NRCC dispatched trackers \u2014 staffers who record video of lawmakers and candidates and sometimes pose their own questions \u2014 to the US Capitol complex and airports in Washington and endangered Democrats\u2019 home districts to pose questions about Biden\u2019s fitness. Pandol\u2019s memo also highlighted the House\u2019s partisan vote last month to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over the audio recordings of Biden\u2019s interviews with former special counsel Robert Hur, who investigated Biden\u2019s handling of classified material and declined to bring charges. \u201cThe NRCC can weaponize these votes in paid advertisements, mail, digital, and earned media to pin Democrats to a conspiracy to protect a President Americans do not believe should be serving another term,\u201d Pandol said in the memo. What Democrats are saying Democratic leaders have broadly stood by Biden in the wake of the last week\u2019s\u00a0debate. However, some down-ballot Democrats have been more critical. Quigley, speaking with Kasie Hunt on \u201cCNN This Morning\u201d Tuesday, was careful to refer to Biden\u2019s term in office as \u201cone of the great presidencies of our lifetime,\u201d but, the Illinois congressman added, \u201cI think he has to be honest with himself.\u201d \u201cThis is a decision he\u2019s going to have to make. He clearly has to understand \u2013 I think what you\u2019re getting to here \u2013 is that his decision not only impacts who\u2019s going to serve in the White House the next four years but who\u2019s going to serve in the Senate, who\u2019s going to serve in the House, and it will have implications for decades to come.\u201d Hunt pressed Quigley: \u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re actually open to the idea that it might be the right decision for him to step aside.\u201d \u201cI think what I\u2019m stressing is, it has to be his decision. But we have to be honest with ourselves that it wasn\u2019t just a horrible night,\u201d Quigley said. On Capitol Hill last Friday, some Democrats expressed alarm about Biden\u2019s struggle to deliver clear answers in the debate. \u201cJoe Biden couldn\u2019t communicate, and Donald Trump lied every time he opened his mouth,\u201d Minnesota Rep. Angie Craig said. Illinois Rep. Brad Schneider said \u201cyeah\u201d when asked if he was keeping the door open to replacing Biden as the Democratic nominee. California Rep. Scott Peters called conversations about replacing Biden \u201cpremature,\u201d but said he is \u201copen to a conversation about how to win this election.\u201d \u201cI think everyone is concerned about last night,\u201d Peters told CNN. \u201cSo the campaign has got to convince a lot of people that this is a campaign we win.\u201d O\u2019Malley\u00a0Dillon\u00a0sought to reassure party leaders and staff on multiple calls Monday morning as the campaign continues to manage the fallout from the president\u2019s poor debate performance last week. One person who was on the calls told CNN that O\u2019Malley\u00a0Dillon\u00a0sought to be \u201creassuring,\u201d and summarized her overarching message as: \u201cThis will pass, but we have to do our work.\u201d She also stressed that \u201cit\u2019s our job to keep everyone calm,\u201d according to the person. Some of the Monday morning calls that O\u2019Malley\u00a0Dillon\u00a0led featured Democratic leaders and staff working for the DNC and the convention, the person said, and were previously scheduled. Participants were able to speak up if they chose to. Some top Democratic officials and supporters close to the White House have balked at the tone and language that some campaign officials have taken as part of their defense. In particular, the decision by the campaign to refer to those who have called on Biden to drop out as \u201cthe bedwetting brigade\u201d has fueled anger and dismay. One senior Democratic official told CNN that tone was \u201cdisrespectful.\u201d Another top Democrat in close touch with the White House said it was \u201cdisgusting.\u201d Multiple people taking issue with language like \u201cbedwetting\u201d told CNN that the tone is dismissive and wholly unappreciative of the very serious and widespread concerns inside the Democratic Party about whether Biden is fit to seek and carry out a second term. In one fundraising email over the weekend sent under the name of deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty, the campaign acknowledged the widespread panic that Biden\u2019s debate performance had caused. \u201cIf you\u2019re like me, you\u2019re getting lots of texts or calls from folks about the state of the race after Thursday. Maybe it was your panicked aunt, your MAGA uncle, or some self-important Podcasters,\u201d the email started.

I know right from wrong. I know how to tell the truth.\u201d It\u2019s a message Democrats quickly latched onto as Biden and his family gathered at Camp David and his campaign seeks to minimize the damage among donors and Democratic allies. Pennsylvania Rep. Madeleine Dean said Monday on CNN that Biden had \u201ca bad 90 minutes. I don\u2019t sugarcoat that.\u201d \u201cBut we have had a bad nine years since June 16, 2015, when Donald Trump came down the escalator,\u201d she said, referring to the launch of Trump\u2019s first presidential run.

{"id": "2024_07_01_politics_biden-trump-hbcus-cnn-debate-reaj", "text": "Both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump boasted about their record of support for historically Black colleges and universities at CNN\u2019s presidential debate\u00a0last week. During the debate, Trump said he \u201cgot (HBCUs) all funded.\u201d CNN determined that this\u00a0claim was exaggerated. Biden also touted his investments for HBCUs, saying \u201cany Black student is capable in college in doing what any White student can do.\u201d Here is where both presidential candidates stand on their records with HBCUs. Biden, Trump and HBCUs During the debate, Biden appeared to\u00a0misstate the amount of investment his administration has contributed to HBCUs,\u00a0\u00a0but CNN\u00a0previously reported\u00a0that his administration has invested more than $16 billion since fiscal year 2021. CNN\u00a0reported\u00a0that in September the Biden administration also demanded governors in 16 states address a more than $12 billion funding disparity between land-grant HBCUs and their non-HBCU counterparts. During the Trump administration, relationships with HBCUs were\u00a0frayed\u00a0at times and Trump\u2019s own views on funding the institutions were inconsistent. In 2017, the former president\u00a0questioned\u00a0the constitutional basis for federal funding for HBCUs, saying,\u00a0according to NPR, that \u201cit benefits schools on the basis of race.\u201d At the time, HBCUs and Black education groups applauded the administration\u2019s restoration of year-round Pell Grants,\u00a0among other efforts. In 2019, Trump signed the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education\u00a0(FUTURE)\u00a0Act, a bipartisan bill aimed at strengthening HBCUs as well as other minority-serving institutions by providing $255 million annually. But organizations, including the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) and the Thurgood Marshall College Fund,\u00a0pressed the administration\u00a0to further bolster federal funding for HBCUs, some of which have faced dire financial straits. Candidates must understand HBCU needs Lodriguez Murray, senior vice president for public policy and government affairs at the UNCF, told CNN that HBCUs have struggled with underfunding \u201csince inception.\u201d HBCUs also\u00a0faced financial challenges\u00a0at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, which led to concerns about how some of the institutions would weather not only budget shortfalls but\u00a0also\u00a0reductions in enrollment. Philanthropic giving to many of the HBCUs increased because of the racial reckoning of 2020, Murray said. That surge in donations, in addition to federal funding,\u00a0he said, helped stabilize many HBCUs. Prior to both\u00a0the\u00a0Trump and Biden administrations, HBCUs experienced steep declines in federal funding from 2003 to 2015, according to\u00a0a report the UNCF released in 2022. However, funding for HBCUs increased during both\u00a0the\u00a0Trump and Biden administrations and, Murray said, funding measures passed during the pandemic \u201chelped HBCUs tremendously.\u201d \u201cCongress took the lead on putting the HBCU funding in those bills and passing them. The third COVID-19 bill, passed under President Biden, included as much funding for HBCUs as both of the first two\u00a0Covid-19 bills\u00a0under President Trump,\u201d he said. Marybeth Gasman, executive director of the Rutgers Center for Minority Serving Institutions,\u00a0said\u00a0\u201cHBCUs are strong and resilient institutions.\u201d \u201cThey are that way because of Black people, Black leaders, Black alumni, Black students. They face obstacles but continue to persevere,\u201d Gasman told CNN. However, leaders supporting HBCUs also insisted that there\u2019s still more work to be done. When it comes to\u00a0HBCUs\u00a0and the presidency, Murray said, \u201cthe book has yet to be finished (on) who will offer the next chapters in terms of HBCU support. That\u2019s what\u2019s on the ballot currently and we want to make sure that whoever wins this race understands what our needs are.\u201d If reelected, Murray said,\u00a0Biden and Trump\u00a0can demonstrate their commitment to HBCUs by investing in both their infrastructure and the students. \u201cAnd you have to do it at the same time. You can\u2019t do one and then the other because you can\u2019t have great buildings, but then students (can) not afford to come,\u201d he said, adding there should also be an increase in Pell\u00a0Grants\u00a0to help underserved students. \u201cProper facilities will attract strong faculty and they will attract\u00a0world-class\u00a0students, which HBCUs already have, but it will attract even more students,\u201d Murray said. In a report released by the\u00a0Government Accountability Office\u00a0in 2018, the agency found that the HBCUs surveyed said \u201c46 percent of their building space, on average, needs repair or replacement.\u201d Cleveland Gary, chief business development officer for the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education, an organization that supports HBCUs and predominately Black institutions, encouraged both candidates to create inclusive programs to benefit the next generation of HBCU students. \u201cThat\u2019s putting a stake in the ground, putting your money where your mouth is, and that shows that you truly care about the lifeblood of this country because they are American citizens as well,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_07_02_politics_trump-sentencing-date-delay-proposal", "text": "Donald Trump will not be sentenced on his business fraud conviction until September, a New York judge ruled Tuesday in the wake of Monday\u2019s Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity. The delay in sentencing means that the former president is likely to escape any concrete punishment for his felony conviction during the summer, at the same time that Trump\u2019s election bid has been boosted by President Joe Biden\u2019s debate flop that has Democrats wondering whether to replace their nominee. Trump was scheduled to be sentenced on July 11. Judge Juan Merchan said the former president will now be sentenced on September 18, \u201cif such is still necessary.\u201d The announcement underscores the far-reaching implications of Monday\u2019s Supreme Court ruling, in which the court\u2019s conservative wing found that presidents have absolute immunity for \u201ccore\u201d presidential duties. The decision has thrown special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s indictment of Trump on election subversion charges into doubt \u2013 and a trial before the November election is all but impossible now. The ruling could impact the indictments of Trump in the classified documents and Georgia election interference cases as well. Trump became the first former US president to be convicted of a felony in May when a Manhattan jury found him guilty of all 34 counts of falsifying business records\u00a0in his\u00a0hush money criminal trial. Trump\u2019s legal team filed a letter Monday seeking to challenge the former president\u2019s conviction after the Supreme Court ruled\u00a0that presidents have an absolute immunity\u00a0from prosecution for core official acts. The Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office on Tuesday agreed the sentencing should be delayed. \u201cAlthough we believe defendant\u2019s arguments to be without merit, we do not oppose his request for leave to file and his putative request to adjourn sentencing pending determination of his motion. We respectfully request a deadline of July 24, 2024\u2014two weeks after defendant\u2019s requested deadline\u2014to file and serve a response,\u201d the DA said in a letter Tuesday. The former president\u2019s lawyers argued that the ruling confirmed their position that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg should not have been allowed to offer evidence at the trial regarding Trump\u2019s \u201cofficial acts\u201d and, as a result, the jury\u2019s guilty verdict should be set aside. Will Scharf, an attorney who represents Trump in the immunity case, told CNN Monday night the high court\u2019s ruling \u201cabsolutely\u201d impacts the hush money case. \u201cThe Supreme Court was very clear that for acts that fall within the outer perimeter of the president\u2019s official responsibilities, acts that are presumptively immune from prosecution, that evidence of those acts cannot be used to try essentially private acts,\u201d he said on \u201cThe Source.\u201d In their letter Monday, Trump\u2019s attorneys pointed to evidence elicited during the trial from Trump\u2019s time in office, including testimony from former Hope Hicks, who served as communications director in the White House; tweets that Trump sent while in office; and phone records involving Trump while he was president. \u201cUnder Trump, this official-acts evidence should never have been put before the jury. Consistent with arguments that we made before and during the trial, the Supreme Court held in Trump that President Trump \u2018may not be prosecuted for exercising his core constitutional powers, and he is entitled, at a minimum, to a presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts,\u2019\u201d Trump\u2019s attorneys wrote. \u201cThe verdicts in this case violate the presidential immunity doctrine and create grave risks of \u2018an Executive Branch that cannibalizes itself,\u2019\u201d they added.

The US has been announcing regular packages for Ukraine since Congress passed legislation that approved nearly $61 billion in Ukraine aid earlier this year. The US recently moved Ukraine to the top of the list to receive air defense capabilities, putting it ahead of other countries who may have already been in line to receive them.

Austin said Tuesday that they would \u201ctake steps to build a bridge to NATO membership for Ukraine.\u201d Umerov thanked Austin for his support and said Ukraine has used it to stop Russia, \u201cstop the aggression towards people, towards our values, national interests.\u201d He said he looked forward to discussing the possibility of Ukraine becoming a future NATO member. \u201cHopefully soon, Ukraine will receive its invitation,\u201d Umerov said of NATO.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/politics/us-ukraine-military-assistance-package/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "politics"}}

While Democrats are counting on a big backlash among younger women against the rollback of abortion rights to help propel Biden, a backlash among younger men against changing gender roles could help lift Trump. Both younger men and women are broadly discontented with the economy and Biden\u2019s job performance, polls show. But the anger and frustration over the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning the federal right to abortion provides Biden a powerful tool to expand his support among young women unhappy with him on other fronts, strategists in both parties agree. For many younger women, pollsters say, the loss of abortion rights has become not only a threat in itself, but a symbol of a broader attempt to reverse women\u2019s gains in economic status and pressure them back into more traditional gender roles. Meanwhile, Biden faces a dual challenge with younger men: Not only is abortion less of a motivating issue for them, but there\u2019s evidence that many of them are receptive to the messaging of Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement, with its implicit promise to restore traditional racial and gender hierarchies. In a striking new Pew Research Center national survey, for instance, fully two-fifths of the men younger than 50 who are supporting Trump agreed that women\u2019s gains in society have come at the expense of men. That was not only more than double the share of younger Biden-supporting men who agreed with that sentiment, but considerably larger even than the share of older Trump-supporting men who agreed. All this suggests that while cultural attitudes may help Biden overcome economic discontent among younger women, an amorphous but insistent sense of cultural marginalization may reinforce Trump\u2019s economic inroads among younger men. Researchers say democracies across the Western world are experiencing a widening partisan and ideological gap between younger men and women. In a much discussed article earlier this year, Financial Times columnist John Burn-Murdoch pointed to survey data in a variety of countries showing that young men were far more likely to identify as conservative than young women. \u201cIn countries on every continent, an ideological gap has opened up between young men and women,\u201d he wrote. That gap has widened in the US, too, though the evidence shows that it is growing more because young women are ideologically moving to the left than because young men are moving to the right. Merged annual results from NBC polls conducted by a bipartisan team of Democratic and Republican pollsters document the trends. In 2013, the share of young men aged 18-29 who called themselves conservative very slightly exceeded the share who identified as liberal, while the reverse was true for young women, according to results provided by Public Opinion Strategies, the GOP half of the partnership that conducts the NBC poll. For each gender, though, the balance between conservatives and liberals was nearly even. In their 2023 results, the pollsters found that young men had shifted slightly left, with slightly more now identifying as liberal than conservative. But, over that same 10-year period, young women had sped leftward: In the 2023 results, three times as many of them identified as liberal than as conservative. In 2013, the share of self-identified liberals among young women exceeded the share among young men by 5 percentage points; by 2023, that gap was nearly four times as large. These shifts over time have produced a situation where younger men are still more liberal than older men on most issues, but not nearly as liberal as younger women. The annual youth poll conducted by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University\u2019s John F. Kennedy school offers perhaps the best snapshot on the gender divergence among younger adults. In this year\u2019s survey, young men were 15 points more likely than young women to support building Trump\u2019s border wall, 12 points more likely to say same-sex relationships are morally wrong and 11 points more likely to say Israel\u2019s response to Hamas in Gaza has been justified. Still, in each case, only a minority of younger men endorsed those conservative viewpoints. But while younger men have moved only modestly to the right on most public policy issues, they have more clearly shifted in their willingness to identify with the Republican Party. The latest annual Harvard youth survey found that among young men, Democrats now only have a 3-percentage point advantage in party identification, down from 22 points as recently as 2020. Among women, the Democratic identification edge over that same period grew from 20 to 26 percentage points. (The NBC surveys likewise found the Democratic advantage narrowing among younger men and widening among younger women over recent years, though the changes were not as dramatic as in the Harvard poll.) \u201cThere is not a ton of evidence that young men are more likely to identify as conservatives, but there does seem to be a growing affinity for Republican identity,\u201d said Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American\u00a0Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. That growing receptivity to the GOP could contribute to a wider gender gap among young people than in recent elections. The latest Harvard poll showed that among likely younger voters, Biden led Trump by about 2-to-1 among women, almost exactly his advantage in the Harvard Poll at this point in 2020. But among likely male voters, the survey found that Biden led Trump by just 6 points, a precipitous, and perilous, decline from his 26-point advantage in the 2020 survey at this point. Other respected sources on voting results in 2020, such as the exit polls, found that Biden didn\u2019t win young men that year by as much as Harvard projected, which would mean his decline now is less severe. Still, pollsters in both parties say their own data track the same movement the Harvard poll identifies, with Biden largely holding his lead from 2020 among younger women, but slipping among younger men, including not only White but Black and Latino younger men. The good news for Biden is that younger women turned out at much higher rates than younger men in 2020; in fact, the gap between female and male turnout that year was wider for younger adults than in any other age group, according to analysis of Census Bureau data by William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Metro thinktank. But Biden has so little margin for error in the battleground states that the level of erosion among younger men that he\u2019s experiencing in polls still poses a grave threat to his reelection. In explaining the growing youth gender gap, analysts point to several factors. One is diverging priorities between young men and women. Even more young women in the Harvard youth poll expressed negative views about Biden\u2019s economic record than young men did, but the women were far more likely than the men to cite abortion as a key factor in their vote. \u201cThe difference is young women are voting more on culture and rights, such as abortion, and young men are probably going to be more compelled to vote on economic reasons,\u201d said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute and author of the forthcoming book, \u201cThe Politics of Gen Z: How the Youngest Voters Will Shape our Democracy.\u201d As with all generations, Trump\u2019s belligerent style also contributes to the widening gender divide. \u201cYounger men admire the strength of Trump, but what younger men think is strong, women think is chaotic, crazy and divisive,\u201d said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, who polled for Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign. Trump also has a significant tactical advantage in that he tends to be portrayed much more positively than Biden on the YouTube channels, podcasts, Reddit threads and TikTok videos that constitute the principal source of information for many young men, noted John Della Volpe, who directs the Harvard youth poll. (In that survey, young men were substantially more likely than young women to say they rely on YouTube as a major source of news.) \u201cThe media ecosystem specifically among young men is [a place] where Joe Biden doesn\u2019t get a break and Trump is stood up as an anti-hero,\u201d said Della Volpe, who is advising a newly formed super PAC trying to boost Biden among young people. Trump has leaned into that advantage by identifying with entertainment that disproportionately draws younger men, like the Ultimate Fighting Championship match he attended as his first public event following his felony conviction in New York. Trump may also be drawing from deeper wells of changing social attitudes. Last week\u2019s Pew finding that two-fifths of younger males backing Trump believe women\u2019s gains have come at men\u2019s expense is only one of many recent poll results suggesting more young men are bristling against the rising demands for gender and racial equity. The new Pew poll, for instance, also found that more than four-fifths of the younger men supporting Trump asserted that all the obstacles blocking women\u2019s advancement in society have been eliminated \u2014 more than double the share of Biden-supporting younger men who agreed. (In this case, older men backing Trump were as likely to endorse that statement as younger ones.) Nearly two-thirds of the younger men supporting Trump also agreed in the poll that \u201csociety is better off if people make marriage and having children a priority\u201d \u2014 equal to the share of older Trump men and more than triple the share of younger Biden men. In an AEI poll this spring, the share of all young men who say efforts to promote gender equity have gone too far reached about 1-in-5, more than double the level in 2017. Survey evidence also shows resistance, particularly among younger White men, to the growing demands from minority groups for more racial equity in education, employment and other settings. In that same AEI poll, over three-fifths of young White women said their race has made their life easier, but far fewer young White men said the same (only about 2-in-5). Conversely, in this year\u2019s Harvard poll, nearly three-fifths of men (of all races) agreed that society is placing too much emphasis on racial identity; only about two-fifths of young women agreed. Exactly three-fourths of younger men supporting Trump in the Pew poll rejected the idea that Whites benefit from advantages in society unavailable to Blacks. This backlash against a changing society only extends so far: Though the \u201ctradwife\u201d movement in social media celebrates women reverting to roles as homemakers and mothers, in the Harvard Poll only about 1-in-6 younger men (and 1-in-10 younger women) agreed that women should prioritize having children over entering the workforce. Deckman noted that compared to older generations, young men today\u00a0\u201chave been raised by their mothers and aunts and grandmothers, who have gone on to hold jobs and be professionals and they are used to seeing women as leaders.\u201d But if young men aren\u2019t moving back to 1950s expectations in large numbers, the surveys showing male unease with women\u2019s increasing independence and authority make clear that something is stirring. \u201cLooking across different surveys and different questions, we can debate about the degree to which it is changing, but there is no doubt we are seeing movement,\u201d said Cox of the AEI. This pushback among young men comes after activism around racial and gender equality in the past few years reached its highest level since the late 1960s and early 1970s, with the rise of the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements and more forceful advocacy in LGBTQ communities. (In the Harvard poll, one-fourth of young women identified in some way as LGBTQ, more than double the share of young men.) It also comes amid continuing evidence that women are navigating the transition to an information-based economy better than men: Women now account for about 60% of all four-year college graduates and nearly 65% of graduate degrees, according to the latest federal statistics. In her upcoming book, Deckman sees the #MeToo movement as the galvanizing force initially propelling more Gen Z women toward liberal activism. That first impulse, she said, has been reinforced by Trump\u2019s 2016 electoral success, despite his extensive history of misogynistic statements and behavior. The sharp turn right on social issues in red states, punctuated by the Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 Dobbs decision overturning the nationwide right to abortion, has provided another spur to activism. Anna Dean, co-founder and co-CEO of the group LOUDwomen, is one of the young female activists Deckman profiles in her book. Dean, now a rising senior at Harvard, helped to start the group in high school in Bentonville, Arkansas, when she noticed that young women and racial minorities were dropping out of school debate activity after biased treatment by the judges. When Trump was elected, she said, the young women felt the same sexist or racist behavior they were fighting in their schools was \u201creflected on the news when we hear Donald Trump speak.\u201d The Dobbs decision, she said, underlined the sense among the young women that their rights were eroding, even as many of them had reached educational milestones unmatched for older women in their families. When relatives or acquaintances tell Dean she is living the \u201cwildest dreams\u201d of earlier generations of women by attending Harvard, she said she often thinks: \u201cOK, yeah this is awesome but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same rights you did when you were my age. I am doing things my ancestors could have only dreamed of, but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same health care rights.\u201d Della Volpe says that from his research and focus groups, he believes that younger men are not so much hostile to the movements demanding more rights for women or LGBTQ people as wondering where that leaves them. \u201cI have empathy for them because in large measure they are just trying to figure life out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they sense and feel, sometimes accurately, sometimes inaccurately, that while they are trying to figure life out that they are being judged by people \u2014 that they are projected to be inferior or bad or ignorant, or worse, racist or homophobic. I think that\u2019s a big part of this.\u201d Such anxieties and grievances about social change have always provided the waters that Trump fishes in. The ability to identify the currents of discontent about change \u2014 cultural, racial or economic \u2014 in each group that he is targeting may be Trump\u2019s greatest skill as a politician. Just as the former president has powerfully appealed to White voters who feel marginalized in a more racially diverse America, or to blue-collar factory towns that feel left behind by the transition to a metro-based information economy, he\u2019s also showing a magnetic pull for the men who feel eclipsed by women\u2019s growing prominence in the workplace and society. Most younger men don\u2019t necessarily hold favorable views about Trump personally, noted Cox, but many are receptive to his broad message that elites in modern US society are discriminating against him and his followers. \u201cThat grievance is what binds them [to him] when very little else does,\u201d Cox said. By contrast, said Deckman, for younger women who believe opportunity and power in US society are still too much tilted toward men, \u201cDonald Trump is the embodiment of many of the things they are opposed to. \u2026 They are sick of old White guys running everything.\u201d That sentiment doesn\u2019t easily translate into enthusiasm for Biden, the other \u201cold White guy\u201d\u00a0in the race. Dean said that despite the distaste for Trump, even young women in her activist circles are more likely to talk about their frustrations with the current president than their fears of the prior one. Given the risk that Biden won\u2019t match his 2020 performance with young men, he has an urgent need to rekindle that flagging enthusiasm among young women. \u201cHe\u2019s got to make up for the defection of young men by winning young women by more, and he\u2019s got to get every young woman he can out to vote,\u201d said Lake, the Democratic pollster. Biden\u2019s best hope of avoiding a catastrophic decline in his youth support is that the number of young women Trump repels exceeds the number of young men he attracts.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/gender-gap-2024-election-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_politics_trump-vp-speculation-miami-rally", "text": "Throughout the week of the presidential debate, some members of former President Donald Trump\u2019s team were already beginning to focus on\u00a0another potentially big race-defining\u00a0event: the roll out of his vice-presidential pick. There are not\u00a0signs and merchandise featuring the names of Trump\u2019s potential contenders sitting in a warehouse waiting to be shared with his supporters.\u00a0Any plotting\u00a0of the potential announcement or rollout has been handled with enormous secrecy so as not to tip off speculation about the selection. But last week, aides and production staff were sent to Trump\u2019s Doral resort in Miami to build out a space for a rally scheduled for July\u00a09.\u00a0The timing and proximity of the rally to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s home \u2013 sure to ignite predictions about Trump\u2019s selection \u2013 was purely coincidental, sources familiar with the event planning told CNN. Rubio, along with Ohio Sen. JD Vance and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, sit atop Trump\u2019s shortlist for the job. Still, among staff and allies, speculation has raged as to whether the Miami event would feature Trump\u2019s long-awaited announcement. And even those closest to the former president continue to insist they are in the dark as to who his ultimate choice will be. Advisers stressed that regardless of the planning around events, the former president would have the final word on where and when his vice presidential pick would be announced. Trump has given himself until the Republican convention in Milwaukee later this month to make a pick and recently told a Virginia television station he will be \u201cmaking a decision sometime early convention or before convention.\u201d \u201cAs President Trump has said himself, the top criteria in selecting a Vice President is a strong leader who will make a great President for eight years after his next four-year term concludes. But anyone telling you they know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying unless that person is named Donald J. Trump,\u201d Trump spokesperson Brian Hughes told CNN. As another person close to Trump put it: \u201cWe can put whatever we want together and hand it to him on the platter and he could say no thanks. It\u2019s not happening until it\u2019s actually happening.\u201d This statement came to pass Monday, when Trump allies noted a change in posture following the debate. Two sources close to the former president said the option of Trump waiting until the convention begins to announce his choice is under consideration again. President Joe\u00a0Biden\u2019s poor performance at Thursday\u2019s debate has further fueled the persistent questions about his fitness for office. As the Democratic hand wringing dominates the post-debate narrative, Trump decided to spend this entire week at his Bedminster golf resort with no public appearances. Some of his campaign staff was told \u2013 to their surprise \u2013 that they should enjoy the 4th\u00a0of July weekend. VP jockeying Meanwhile, the jockeying to join Trump on the ticket has continued, unabated by the debate fallout. Advocates\u00a0for\u00a0Rubio were casting doubt on Burgum, and flagging that Burgum\u2019s record on abortion would bring the issue, which Trump has tried to separate himself from, back into the spotlight. Vance and Rubio, meanwhile, are friends in the Senate, though that hasn\u2019t stopped\u00a0supporters of each VP candidate from pushing negative attacks against the other. Allies of Vance have been continuing to promote Vance\u2019s ability to carry the MAGA torch, though some opposed to the Ohio senator also argue that his image as a Trump standard bearer, in addition to his youth, could work against him. Some Trump allies have also sought to emphasize that Trump and Rubio don\u2019t get along as well, in comparison to the former president\u2019s relationships with Burgum and Vance. They\u2019ve also been quick to point out the areas in which the two are out of step, including on some foreign policy areas and \u201cdeep state\u201d issues, as one person close to Trump phrased it. One Trump confidante told CNN he expects the former president\u2019s team is preparing for the unlikely scenario Biden exits the race \u2013 an outcome that, however unlikely, could spark new considerations for his running mate. \u201cI\u2019d drag this out for two weeks,\u201d the confidante told CNN. \u201cLet Biden twist.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/politics/trump-vp-speculation-miami-rally/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_biden-trump-presidential-debate-analysis", "text": "If Joe Biden loses November\u2019s election, history will record that it took just 10 minutes to destroy a presidency. It was clear a political disaster was about to unfold as soon as the 81-year-old commander in chief stiffly shuffled on stage in Atlanta to stand eight feet from ex-President Donald Trump at what may turn into the most fateful presidential debate in history. Objectively, Biden produced the weakest performance since John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon started the tradition of televised debates in 1960 \u2014 then, as on Thursday, in a television studio with no audience. Minutes into the showdown, hosted by CNN, a full-blown Democratic panic was underway at the idea of heading into the election with such a diminished figure at the top of the ticket. Biden\u2019s chief debate coach, Ron Klain, famously argues that \u201cwhile you can lose a debate at any time, you can only win it in the first 30 minutes.\u201d By that standard, the president\u2019s showing was devastating. The tone of the evening was set well before the half hour. It is too early to say how voters will respond and whether the president can rescue himself. But Biden barely beat Trump in key battleground states in the middle of a pandemic in 2020. His approval rating was below 40% before the debate, when he was at best neck-and-neck with his rival in the polls. It would only take a few thousand voters to desert him to put Trump back in the White House. There has been no public sign that Biden is unable to fulfill the duties of the presidency, which include tough decisions on national security. He has just returned from two grueling foreign trips, for instance. But on Thursday\u2019s evidence, his ability to communicate with the country \u2013 and even to sell his own vision for a second term \u2013 is severely compromised. If the debate was the president\u2019s best chance to turn around a tight race with Trump, which has him in deep peril of losing reelection, it was a failure. Biden ended the night with the Democratic Party in crisis with serious conversations taking place behind the scenes among senior figures over whether his candidacy is now sustainable, two months before the Democratic National Convention. The president aimed for an immediate rebound at a post-debate rally in North Carolina Friday, appearing rested, defiant and animated in what was a clear attempt to a quiet a storm of questions about whether he should shelve his reelection race. \u201cI know I\u2019m not a young man, to state the obvious,\u201d Biden told a crowd that chanted \u201cfour more years, four more years.\u201d The\u00a0president added,\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t walk as easy as I used\u00a0to. I\u00a0don\u2019t speak as smoothly as I used to.\u00a0I don\u2019t debate as well as I used to.\u201d Biden went on, raising his voice,\u201cBut I know what I do know. I know how to tell the truth. I know right from wrong. And I know how to do this job.\u201d \u201cI know what millions of Americans know: When you get knocked down, you get back up.\u201d Biden\u2019s much improved performance in a scripted stump speech before a friendly audience however only further exposed his failures on Thursday night when he had his best chance to counter Trump before tens of millions of television viewers. Trump\u2019s task on Thursday was to avoid playing into Biden\u2019s claims that he\u2019s \u201cunhinged\u201d and is therefore unfit to return to the Oval Office. He largely did so as he got out of the way while the president was damaging his own campaign. The presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s unaccustomed restraint, however, did wear thin later in the debate. But in one devastating moment, after yet another Biden waffle, he said: \u201cI really don\u2019t know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don\u2019t think he knows what he said, either.\u201d The ex-president didn\u2019t avoid his own disqualifying issues. He was uncouth and divisive. He spouted outrageous falsehoods about his own presidency, his attempt to steal the last election, and sometimes lapsed into gibberish himself, especially when asked about climate change. He blatantly lied about his role in the mob attack by his supporters on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. The twice-impeached convicted felon repeatedly declined to say that he would accept the result of the 2024 election if he lost and made sweeping, vague and often illogical claims that US enemies overseas would bend to his will just because of his personality. The former president also struggled to parry Biden\u2019s arguments that he\u2019d slash taxes for rich Americans and leave workers struggling, and he was wobbly on policy, just as he was in the White House. By the time the aged rivals slipped into a bitter debate about who was the best golfer, it was not hard to understand why voters have long told pollsters that they want no part of the choice they have been offered this year. Why Biden\u2019s showing could be so consequential But Biden has rooted his reelection in the idea that he is the last thing standing between America and a second Trump presidency that would destroy democracy and usher in an unprecedented era of American autocracy. Voters who take him at his word could not help but be alarmed at his abject debate showing. Biden\u2019s voice was weak, at times reduced to a whisper. Early on, the president\u2019s answers drifted into incoherence. He missed openings to jab Trump on abortion \u2014 the top Democratic talking point \u2014 and meandered into highlighting his own biggest political liability, immigration. \u201cWe finally beat Medicare,\u201d Biden said at one point, lapsing into confused silence. It was the kind of debate gaffe that Democrats had hoped to avoid. Worse, while Trump spoke, Biden often watched, his mouth gaping open, exacerbating an impression of a president cruelly diminished. His bravura battering of Trump in a debate four years ago was a distant memory. To see a president struggle before millions of people watching on television all around the world was tough to see. As a matter of humanity, the personification of the ravages of age that await everyone was painful. Biden\u2019s campaign revealed during the debate that he had been suffering from a cold. But by that time, the damage had already been done. Biden had entered the debate facing a somber test \u2014 to prove to the majority of Americans who believe he is too old to serve that he is vital, energetic and up to fulfilling his duties in a second term that would end when he is 86. Instead, the president ended up validating those fears and potentially convincing many more voters that his faculties have decayed. The stumbling performance raised questions about the strategic choice Biden\u2019s campaign made in pushing for a debate with Trump. It also completely undercut attempts by the White House and the campaign to talk up Biden\u2019s heartiness behind the scenes. Memories of the president\u2019s barnstorming State of the Union address in March, when he put many fears about his age to rest, have now been obliterated. \u2018Painful\u2019 Often, presidential debates are remembered for visual moments that become embedded in the collective public consciousness in subsequent days. Troublingly for Biden, a viewer only paying attention to visual clues would surely have formed the impression that Trump was the more robust personality. And the history of presidential elections suggests that the candidate who seems strong often beats the one who is weak. \u201cIt\u2019s painful. I love Joe Biden,\u201d said Van Jones, a CNN political commentator. \u201cHe\u2019s a good man, he loves his country, he\u2019s doing the best that he can. But he had a chance \u2026 tonight to restore confidence of the country and of the base and he failed to do that. And I think there are a lot of people who are going to want to see him take a different course now.\u201d Vice President Kamala Harris led attempts to turn the focus away from the optics of Biden\u2019s performance to the threat posed by his Republican opponent. \u201cYes, there was a slow start, but it was a strong finish,\u201d Harris told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper following the debate. \u201cAnd what became very clear through the course of the night is that Joe Biden is fighting on behalf of the American people. On substance, on policy, on performance, Joe Biden is extraordinarily strong.\u201d \u201cPeople can debate on style points. But ultimately, this election and who is the president of the United States has to be about substance. And the contrast is clear. Look at what happened during the course of the debate. Donald Trump lied over and over and over again as he is wont to do,\u201d she said. Biden\u2019s best moments came too late Harris is correct in her assessment of Trump\u2019s cascade of untruths. And as the debate wore on, the president did seem to get a little stronger. He was especially animated when he spoke about Trump\u2019s threat to democracy. He was scathing about the ex-president\u2019s failure to admit defeat four years ago. \u201cYou can\u2019t stand the loss,\u201d Biden said. \u201cSomething snapped in you when you lost the last time.\u201d And in an extraordinary moment in a debate before millions of television viewers, Biden highlighted Trump\u2019s conviction in his hush money trial in New York. \u201cHow many billions of dollars do you owe in civil penalties for molesting a woman in public? For doing a whole range of things? Of having sex with a porn star on the night \u2013 while your wife was pregnant?\u201d Biden asked Trump. \u201cYou have the morals of an alley cat.\u201d The former president was found guilty last month of 34 counts of falsifying business records in his criminal hush money trial. Last year, a jury found him liable for sexual abuse in a civil defamation suit. And Trump, his adult sons and the Trump Organization lost a huge civil fraud trial, also in New York. But the problem for Biden was that his best moments of the night came deep into the 90-minute showdown, by which time most viewers would have formed strong impressions. And at times, he appeared unable to defend his record or effectively expose Trump\u2019s torrent of falsehoods and distortions of his own first-term legacy. The president only briefly flashed his beaming smile, which he had effectively used to debunk Trump\u2019s absurd arguments in their debate four years ago and when he rhetorically dismembered Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan during the 2012 vice presidential debate. If the cacophony of behind-the-scenes venting by Democrats coalesces into more serious questions about Biden\u2019s capacity, the crisis around him will deepen. But it is hard to see any easy way \u2014 apart from a decision by the president not to accept the party nomination \u2013 that there could be any change to the Democratic ticket. And any decision to try and replace a president who has successfully run the table in Democratic nominating contests would be unprecedented in the modern age and might end up dividing the party \u2014 a step that in itself could help Trump become only the second president to win a non-consecutive second term. There has been little effort by the Biden White House to promote Harris as the president\u2019s heir \u2014 and she has significant political problems of her own. And no Democrat with future presidential possibilities \u2014 for instance, California Gov. Gavin Newsom or Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer \u2014 took the risk of challenging an incumbent who once presented himself as a bridge to the future of the party. Biden is not the first president to have a bad debate \u2014 although his ordeal on Thursday far surpasses the misfires by Barack Obama and Ronald Reagan. Both those presidents bounced back the next time they got the chance on the debate stage and went on to win a second term. But while a second debate with Trump is scheduled for September, it is hard to find a tactical rationale for the ex-president to offer his rival a do-over. One Democratic operative summed up the president\u2019s debate for CNN\u2019s Kasie Hunt with a word that now threatens to encapsulate his entire reelection bid unless Biden can turn the story around. \u201cHorrific,\u201d the person said.

{"id": "2024_07_02_politics_judge-terminates-agreement-migrant-children", "text": "A federal judge has partially terminated a decades-old agreement that oversees\u00a0conditions for migrant children in federal government custody, according to a court order that took effect Monday. US District Judge Dolly M. Gee\u2019s ruling terminates, with exceptions, the 1997 Flores Settlement agreement \u2013 which has set the national standards for the humane treatment of children in US custody \u2013 at the Department of Health and Human Services, while allowing the agreement to remain in full effect at US Customs and Border Protection and US Immigration Customs Enforcement.\u00a0The court agreed with the Biden administration, with some exceptions, that\u00a0a new HHS regulation, which went into effect on Monday,\u00a0provided appropriate oversight and \u201cmultiple safeguards\u201d to account for the lack of state licensing in places like Texas and Florida. Unaccompanied migrant children go through immigration processing while in CBP custody before they are transferred\u00a0to the care of HHS, where they remain until they are reunited with a sponsor, like a parent or relative in the US. \u201cWe are deeply disappointed by the Court\u2019s ruling and concerned it places thousands of children in harm\u2019s way,\u201d said Leecia Welch, counsel for the plaintiffs and deputy legal director at\u00a0Children\u2019s Rights. The Biden administration\u00a0argued\u00a0in May\u00a0that\u00a0the new\u00a0HHS\u00a0regulation, known as the \u201cUnaccompanied Children Program Foundational Rule,\u201d provided additional protections and responded to unforeseen changes, CNN previously reported. \u201cThe Rule \u2018return[s] both parties as nearly as possible to where they would have been absent the changed circumstances\u2019 because it still requires unlicensed facilities to meet their state\u2019s licensing requirements,\u201d Gee said in the ruling. Attorneys for the plaintiffs argued that the federal regulation fell short of providing some migrant children, like those in medium-secure facilities, with the protections of the Flores Settlement and failed to address the lack of state licensing of unaccompanied migrant shelters in places like Texas and Florida, according to the court order. \u201cThe regulations were a huge step forward - it was the failure to account for the lack of state licensing that created a serious concern for us. Plus, the fact that the regulations fail to protect some of the most vulnerable children in ORR custody - those in more restrictive placements who often have more acute trauma and mental health needs,\u201d Welch said. ORR refers to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, an agency within HHS. The Biden administration argued that the new federal regulations require shelters housing unaccompanied migrant children \u201cto be state-licensed or, if state licensing is not available \u2026 to adhere to the state\u2019s licensing requirements,\u201d according to court documents. CNN has reached out to HHS for comment. In\u00a0April HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said\u00a0the new federal regulation \u201cunderscores HHS\u2019 unwavering commitment to the health, safety, and welfare of unaccompanied children in our care.\u201d \u201cBy enhancing the legal framework governing the UC (unaccompanied children) Program, we set clear standards for the care and treatment of unaccompanied children in ORR\u2019s custody and the support they receive as they transition into new communities,\u201d Becerra said in a news release at the time. Gee\u2019s ruling allows attorneys representing the plaintiffs, like Welch, to have access to HHS facilities and to information about the children in custody there\u00a0\u2013 which leaves the door open for attorneys to keep an eye on migrant children in HHS custody. \u201cOur team will hold the government accountable to their promises to keep children in unlicensed facilities safe -and if they fail to provide adequate alternative safeguards to state licensing in Texas and Florida - we will not hesitate to return to court,\u201d Welch said. The\u00a0Trump administration\u00a0tried but failed to terminate the Flores Settlement in 2019, according to court documents. Under Gee\u2019s ruling, the court has the power to modify the order if the circumstances change, including if the new federal regulation is rescinded or modified to be inconsistent with the Flores Settlement \u2013 which gives some attorneys confidence that the order has the necessary guardrails to protect migrant children regardless of who occupies the White House. \u201cThe fact that the order retains jurisdiction over both HHS and DHS and maintains our ability to hear directly from children gives me hope that no matter what happens in November- the fundamental protections afforded to immigrant children under Flores for the last 27 years will continue,\u201d Welch said. But some immigration advocates and attorneys are still concerned that the ruling could mean some migrant children in government detention could end up in dangerous conditions. \u201cHaving spent almost two decades advocating for children in government custody, I have repeatedly witnessed children in dangerous conditions. The premature termination of Flores creates a situation in which unaccompanied children in immigration custody may end up in dangerous conditions that go unnoticed and unaddressed for years to come,\u201d said Neha Desai, senior director of immigration at the National Center for Youth Law.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/politics/judge-terminates-agreement-migrant-children/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_politics_rudy-giuliani-officially-disbarred-in-new-york", "text": "The New York state Supreme Court on Tuesday disbarred former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani over his part in Donald Trump\u2019s election interference efforts in 2020. The long-expected disbarment of Trump\u2019s most high-profile lawyer, which is effective immediately, is a major blow to the former public official at a time he faces fallout for spreading lies about the 2020 election. In addition to losing his law license \u2013 which is likely to be recognized across the country \u2013 Giuliani is in bankruptcy after landing $150 million in debt for defaming two election workers, and faces several other lawsuits against him as well as criminal charges. \u201cThe seriousness of (Giuliani\u2019s) misconduct cannot be overstated,\u201d the court wrote. \u201c(Giuliani)\u00a0flagrantly misused his prominent position as the personal attorney for former President Trump and his campaign, through which (he) repeatedly and intentionally made false statements, some of which were perjurious, to the federal court, state lawmakers, the public, the (Attorney Grievance Committee), and this Court concerning the 2020 Presidential election, in which he baselessly attacked and undermined the integrity of this country\u2019s electoral process.\u201d Giuliani, the court said, \u201cnot only deliberately violated some of the most fundamental tenets of the legal profession, but he also actively contributed to the national strife that has followed the 2020 Presidential election, for which he is entirely unrepentant.\u201d Giuliani previously was suspended from being able to practice law while the New York court considered attorney discipline proceedings against him. In its ruling, the court cited the former Trump attorney\u2019s efforts to overturn the election results in several 2020 battleground states. On X, Giuliani said he was \u201cnot surprised\u201d by the ruling and blasted what he said was a corrupt system. A spokesman for Giuliani also condemned the disbarment, which had gone through several proceedings before the court\u2019s final decision on Tuesday. \u201cMembers of the legal community who respect the rule of law in this country should immediately come forward and speak out against this politically and ideologically corrupted decision. We will be appealing this objectively flawed decision in hopes that the appellate process will restore integrity into our system of justice,\u201d spokesman Ted Goodman said in a statement. Giuliani played a key role in several of Trump\u2019s schemes to overturn the results of the 2020 election. He was involved in alleged efforts to put forth fake electors to falsely certify Trump victories in several states, such as Arizona and Georgia, and, as the court noted Tuesday, Giuliani \u201cfalsely and dishonestly asserted to the public that people were brought from Camden, New Jersey, to vote illegally in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, during the 2020 presidential election.\u201d In Georgia, Giuliani is charged with a RICO violation as well as several additional felonies, including soliciting Georgia state lawmakers, making false statements to the Georgia House and Senate and working to put forward fake electors in the state. He is one of several co-conspirators indicted in that case, in which Trump also is a defendant. He is facing charges related to the election subversion efforts in Arizona and is an unindicted co-conspirator\u00a0in Trump\u2019s federal election subversion case. Giuliani has pleaded not guilty to all the charges against him. This story has been updated with additional details. CNN\u2019s Owen Dahlkamp and Michelle Shen contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/politics/rudy-giuliani-officially-disbarred-in-new-york/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "politics"}}
