The\u00a0purpose of the network was to smuggle people, not bring in terrorists,\u00a0one of\u00a0the officials said. But it has ties to the same network\u00a0that brought a group\u00a0of\u00a0Uzbek nationals last summer across the southern border by a facilitator who had ties to ISIS, the official said.\u00a0CNN was first to report on that incident\u00a0in 2023. In the latest case, the 400 migrants under scrutiny \u2013 mostly from Central Asian nations \u2013 are being screened purely because of their connection to the\u00a0human smuggling\u00a0network. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters Wednesday that the department hasn\u2019t identified \u201c400 people with potential ISIS ties.\u201d Of those 400 people,\u00a0a\u00a0number of them\u00a0have\u00a0been detained by immigration authorities, according to the official.\u00a0But there\u00a0haven\u2019t been cases identified of anyone threatening the US at this point, the official said. Vetting is ongoing. NBC News was\u00a0first to report\u00a0the figure of 400 migrants. The review comes as US officials have grown increasingly concerned about migrants from Central Asian nations such as Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Earlier this month, officials arrest\u00a0eight Tajik nationals\u00a0across the country after officials discovered that they had some specific and troubling connections to the terror group. The leadership of ISIS-K is mainly made up of Tajik nationals and the group has recruited from both countries.\u00a0Tajik nationals have carried out a series of recent attacks in Europe on behalf of the group, including the Crocus Hall\u00a0attack in Moscow in March that killed more than 100 people. US officials have been paying particular attention since last summer, when a group\u00a0of\u00a0Uzbek nationals who had crossed the southern border were later found to have been assisted in traveling to the United States by a facilitator who had ties to ISIS. The episode sparked a scramble across the US government to locate and investigate those people. Two US officials also said that it spurred national security officials to ensure that immigration and intelligence authorities were appropriately monitoring anyone traveling from Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. \u201cI think what (the incident with the Uzbek nationals) did last summer was suggest Central Asians are potentially a population of concern, given what we know about the global ISIS network right now,\u201d a senior US official previously told CNN. The more recent episode played out in a similar fashion: The eight men from Tajikistan\u00a0initially entered the US at the southern border and requested asylum under US immigration law.\u00a0By the time intelligence that was collected on overseas ISIS targets connected the men to the terror group, they had already been vetted by immigration authorities and allowed into the country, officials said. Though there is no hard evidence indicating that they were sent to the US as part of a terror plot, at least some of the\u00a0Tajik nationals\u00a0had expressed\u00a0extremist\u00a0rhetoric in their communications, either on social media or in direct private communications that US intelligence was\u00a0able to monitor, three officials said. National security officials feared that at least some of the eight Tajiks were ripe for radicalization by ISIS-K while they were inside the United States, potentially struggling with isolation, financial stress or discrimination \u2013 all things that could make a person susceptible to ISIS propaganda glorifying violence. Senior officials now see a so-called lone-wolf attacker who emerges seemingly from nowhere as perhaps the more likely \u2013\u00a0and potentially equally dangerous \u2013\u00a0threat rather than the more traditional coordinated plot carried out by trained operatives. Earlier Wednesday, Mayorkas told MSNBC that \u201cwe have no evidence that (the 400) are individuals plotting to harm the United States.\u201d \u201cWe screen and vet individuals at the time of encounter. If we learn of derogatory information, we take enforcement action, we are proceeding with extreme caution here in the service of the security and safety of the American people, number one,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_06_26_politics_primaries-maga-squad-what-matters", "text": "There must be some sort of larger takeaway in the fact that Rep. Lauren Boebert, among the most MAGA members of Congress, won a Republican primary in Colorado on Tuesday night, and Rep. Jamaal Bowman, a member of the progressive \u201cSquad\u201d from the Bronx, lost a Democratic primary to a more moderate candidate from Westchester County in New York. Every House race is different, obviously, since all politics is local, according to the old saying. So it would be an oversimplification to say that Republicans moved more MAGA and Democrats moved more moderate based on these two unrelated races. More MAGA or moderate? And yet there\u2019s evidence to support that general trend. Look no further than the two parties\u2019 presidential candidates. Former President Donald Trump personifies MAGA, and a large part of the Make America Great Again ethos he pushes is loyalty to him. President Joe Biden, on the other hand, effectively worked with Republicans to pass a bill to improve the nation\u2019s infrastructure and has said he wants to work with Republicans on immigration reform. Many Republicans will tell you they don\u2019t believe Biden. There\u2019s nothing moderate about either Boebert or Bowman, who occupy space on the fringe of their respective parties. Both were also seriously flawed candidates with problems that extend beyond policy. Boebert was kicked out of a theater last year for vaping and \u201ccausing a disturbance,\u201d for instance. Bowman was charged last year with pulling a fire alarm in a House office building when there was no emergency. Rather than face voters in the district she narrowly won two years ago, Boebert moved to run in a district with a more conservative voting record. She emerged from a crowded field to win the Republican primary in the district, which was previously represented by Rep. Ken Buck, a conservative Republican who is a critic of Trump and had resigned from office in frustration. Bowman, on the other hand, was targeted by more mainstream Democrats in part for his loud criticism of Israel in its war on Hamas in Gaza, an issue that has split Democrats this year. Pro-Israel groups spent heavily in the race, attempting to oust Bowman. However, in advertising, Bowman was attacked more for his opposition to Biden\u2019s policies than for his position on Israel. Evidence of a liberal retreat I asked CNN\u2019s Gregory Krieg, who covered the Bowman race, why he thinks Bowman lost and what it says about Democrats today. Here\u2019s what he emailed back: KRIEG: There are obviously many ways to read Bowman\u2019s defeat, and his failure to bridge the gap with pro-Israel Jewish voters in the district, specifically in Westchester, is understandably the one you\u2019re hearing most often. But I also think, if we\u2019re looking at this through a national lens, it\u2019s hard to not see it as part of the broader liberal retreat from some of the more aggressive left-wing characters and candidates they embraced during Trump\u2019s presidency.\u00a0 For all the talk about Democrats\u2019 lack of enthusiasm about Biden personally, the idea of Biden \u2013 the moderate, even-tempered statesman type \u2013 is still very, very popular. And (Westchester County Executive George) Latimer, to some extent, embodied that.  It obviously did not help Bowman that AIPAC (the American Israel Public Affairs Committee) and other outside groups bombarded him with record spending and gobs of money invested in research into every thought that\u2019s crossed his mind the last 25 years.  That primary voters did not hold the spending against Latimer, as progressives argued they should, also reminds me that voters (especially Democrats) in presidential cycles tend to be cautious. You\u2019ll probably never hear Trump, Fox News or anyone on the right mention Latimer\u2019s name. And for some folks left-of-center, that\u2019s priceless. Utah went its own way While Boebert\u2019s victory provides a foil for Bowman\u2019s loss, it was far from a perfect night for more MAGA Republicans. In a separate Colorado race, the chair of the state GOP, Dave Williams, who had gotten Trump\u2019s endorsement but who said controversial things about gay rights \u2013 including that Pride flags should be burned \u2013 lost to the more establishment pick, Jeff Crank, a real estate investor and former talk radio host. And in Utah, Republicans snubbed the MAGA options for both governor and senator in a state that is very conservative but where the base of Mormon voters has bristled at the former president. Current Sen. Mitt Romney is a notable Trump critic in the GOP, and his decision not to run for reelection opened up an opportunity to replace one of the few remaining Republicans who voted to convict Trump on impeachment charges in 2021 with a Trump-backed Republican. Rep. John Curtis, the winner of the GOP Senate primary, did not vote to convict Trump as a member of the House, but he is the rare Republican focused on climate change, an issue that disproportionately affects Utah but which Trump dismisses. The larger problem \u2026 Both Curtis and Gov. Spencer Cox were actually rejected by GOP party activists at the state\u2019s nominating convention but found their way onto the ballot with the help of signature drives. Cox has taken more moderate positions on certain issues and was booed at the state GOP convention this year,\u00a0according to The Associated Press. But Cox and Curtis both easily won their primaries, which essentially determine the winner of statewide contests in a state like Utah. It\u2019s a shame that primary voters are becoming the de facto general election voters in states and districts that lean heavily to one side or the other, according to former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, a Republican who wrote a lament in The Washington Post that most of the country lives in a state with \u201ctrifecta\u201d government, where one party controls most of what\u2019s happening at their state level. Daniels writes: The issue isn\u2019t simply that states lean reliably Republican or Democratic. It\u2019s that now a big majority are heavily, maybe irrevocably, tilted in one direction or the other. Where that obtains, office seekers pitch their initial appeals to the hard core on their side, as primary candidates always have. The difference is that, instead of the winner\u2019s traditional post-primary imperative, to reach out to nonpartisans and even open-minded members of the opposing party, now their job is finished. There are efforts to change this dynamic, which we\u2019ve written about in this newsletter, such as in states experimenting with nonpartisan primaries and ranked-choice voting. But Daniels has a point. None of the races we\u2019ve discussed so far in this story are expected to be at all competitive in November.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/politics/primaries-maga-squad-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "politics"}}

In order to qualify, candidates had to satisfy the requirements outlined in Article II, Section 1 of the US Constitution to serve as president, as well as file a formal statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission. According to parameters set by CNN in May, all participating debaters had to appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold to win the presidency and receive at least 15% in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters that meet CNN\u2019s standards for reporting. Polls that meet those standards are those sponsored by CNN, ABC News, CBS News, Fox News, Marquette University Law School, Monmouth University, NBC News, The New York Times/Siena College, NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College, Quinnipiac University, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post. Biden and Trump were the only candidates to meet those requirements. The pair has also agreed to participate in another debate hosted by ABC on September 10. What are the rules of the debate? The debate will include two commercial breaks, according to the network, and campaign staff may not interact with their candidate during that time. The candidates agreed to appear at a uniform podium. Microphones will be muted throughout the debate except for the candidate whose turn it is to speak. While no props or pre-written notes will be allowed on the stage, candidates will be given a pen, a pad of paper and a bottle of water. The event will not feature a studio audience.

{"id": "2024_06_27_politics_us-israel-patriot-missile-defense-discussions-ukraine", "text": "The Biden administration is\u00a0holding discussions\u00a0with Israel and Ukraine\u00a0about\u00a0the possibility of transferring aging Patriot air defense systems currently in Israel to\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0as it continues to defend itself in the war with Russia, according to a senior administration official and a source familiar with the discussions, as the US urgently prioritizes air defenses for Kyiv. No final agreement has been reached to transfer the crucial systems - and the countries are still working through specific logistics - but the administration official said\u00a0they are hopeful the efforts might succeed, especially given the effectiveness of the Patriot batteries already operating in Ukraine. The US and Germany have already sent Patriot systems to Ukraine, but the Biden administration has made it clear that Kyiv needs more as Russia continues to launch aerial attacks on the country. It is unclear how long the process of finalizing details and transferring the systems to Ukraine would take. The systems would likely need to be transferred to the US first, where they would undergo refurbishment, before being sent to Ukraine. If completed, the transfer would mark a\u00a0significant shift in Israel\u2019s position regarding the war in Ukraine. Israel has been careful not to overtly criticize Russia, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has tried to walk a fine line with President Vladimir Putin. Russia in 2022 warned that providing Israeli arms to Ukraine would \u201cdestroy all interstate relations between our countries.\u201d Though Israel has participated in the US-led multinational group to ship supplies to Ukraine, the Israeli government has been loathe to openly provide Kyiv with weapons. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky pleaded for Iron Dome missile interceptors months after Russia\u2019s invasion began. But Israel said it would only help Ukraine develop an air defense system instead of sending weapons, an offer Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to Israel said was \u201ctoo late.\u201d The Financial Times first reported news of the ongoing discussions. In April, the Israel Defense Forces said it would soon retire its Patriot systems, which were first fully integrated into the military in 1991. The first Israeli Patriot intercept came during the 2014 war between Israel and Hamas, when the system shot down a drone launched from Gaza. But the Patriot missiles is not Israel\u2019s primary air defense system. To date, the IDF said Israeli Patriot batteries have carried out 19 interceptions, including nine during the current war. Israel relies far more on its short-range Iron Dome aerial defense system, as well as its medium-range David\u2019s Sling and long-range Arrow missiles. Last week, the Biden administration announced that it was prioritizing\u00a0critical air defense\u00a0capabilities\u00a0for Ukraine over other countries to \u201censure Ukraine\u2019s survival\u201d in what was described as a \u201crather extraordinary\u201d policy adjustment at a critical moment for Ukraine. \u201cWe work with all of our partners to take into account what [Ukraine\u2019s] defense needs are, and we\u2019re going to do everything we can to support those,\u201d said Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder at a news briefing last week. \u201cThe bottom-line message here to our allies and partners is, if there\u2019s an existential threat, you know, we\u2019re going to step up and we\u2019re going to help you.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/politics/us-israel-patriot-missile-defense-discussions-ukraine/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_06_20_sport_willie-mays-analysis-spt-intl", "text": "When people ask me how good of a player Willie Mays was, I give them a perhaps odd answer. The San Francisco Giants basically gave Mays to the New York Mets for practically nothing in 1972, and a well past his prime 41-year-old Mays was the best overall hitter \u2013 as measured by his ability to get on base and hit for power \u2013 on that solid Mets squad. Of course, the more normal way to know how good Mays was is that he remains, statistically, the best player who played his entire career in the last century and is in the Hall of Fame. But if you truly want to know how great Mays was? You had to watch him play. I couldn\u2019t help thinking of my Father when I learned of Mays\u2019 passing last night on \u201cThe Source.\u201d I mentioned him almost immediately. You see, my Father watched Mays play when he came up as a rookie for the New York Giants in 1951. He considered Mays the best player he ever saw from the moment he laid eyes on him in that inaugural year. Mays supercharged that \u201851 Giants squad and helped them overcome a 13.5-game deficit in mid-August to win the NL pennant over their crosstown rivals, the Brooklyn Dodgers, thanks to the Shot Heard \u2018Round the World. It remains, in my opinion, the greatest comeback in baseball history. Mays won Rookie of the Year that season. It was three years later, however, when Mays became a baseball legend. After serving in the military for over a season, the man nicknamed the \u201cSay Hey Kid\u201d \u2013 who had a great song written about him playing on that name \u2013 dominated the National League. He led the league in batting average, slugging percentage (a measure of power), triples (one of the ultimate measures of speed and power) and on-base plus slugging (OBPS), which combines all of it into one metric. And yet, I don\u2019t think most remember Mays\u2019 1954 MVP season for his offensive exploits; people like my Father remember him for a play he made during Game 1 of the 1954 World Series. Let me set the scene: the game is tied 2-2 in the eighth inning. The Cleveland Indians have runners on first and second with no one out. Cleveland power hitter Vic Wertz is at the plate, and he hits a long fly ball into the truly cavernous center field at the Polo Grounds in New York. Mays, who roamed center field for over 20 seasons, went back more than 400 feet and made a difficult, over-the-shoulder catch seem easy. He then fired the ball back into the infield to ensure that no runs would score. The Giants would go on to win the game and sweep the series in four games. It was their swan song in New York, as they moved to the West Coast after the 1957 season. Mays never understood why people thought that catch was amazing. For him, it was relatively routine. What was unique about this catch, beyond being in the World Series, was that video cameras captured it in an era from which we don\u2019t have many recordings. That short splice of film is our version of getting to see Mays play. It\u2019s our rare glimpse into a man whose defensive prowess was far more than that one catch. Mays was the best defensive player at any position that entire season in the National League, according to advanced statistics. He is, by those same metrics, a top-five defensive outfielder of all time, and those statistics \u2013 given we don\u2019t have a lot of video from the era \u2013 don\u2019t even really take into account his obviously great arm. The fact that I\u2019m talking about the defense of a man who for a long period of time was third all-time in home runs \u2013 and remains sixth \u2013 tells you everything you need to know. Mays wasn\u2019t just defense, though he excelled at that. He wasn\u2019t just about hitting for power, though he excelled at that. He wasn\u2019t just hitting for average, though he excelled at that. He wasn\u2019t just about speed, even though he excelled at that and led the league in stolen bases four times. Mays was everything \u2013 and he was so for over 20 years. Mays was, as my friend and esteemed sports columnist Neil Paine calculated, the most complete ballplayer in history. Baseball fans talk about finding five-tool players \u2013 those who hit for power and average, have speed and defensive abilities in terms of range and arm \u2013 like a miner trying to find gold. Well, we found our gold in Mays. But again, Mays is more than just numbers. He was one of our last links to multiple eras of baseball history. Mays oversaw the expansion of baseball to the West Coast in 1958, when it had previously been played on the Major League level only east of the Mississippi River. He was the first superstar on the West Coast. Mays was also the last superstar with us who made his name playing in New York during the 1950s. It was baseball\u2019s golden era; a time when America came out of World War II with a booming economy and during which baseball continued to outrank football as America\u2019s favorite sport and pastime. And if Mays wasn\u2019t good enough, he actually added a few hits to his storied, record-book career a few weeks ago when Negro League statistics were integrated into the MLB record books. Mays was one of the last living stars who started his career in the Negro Leagues in 1948 for Birmingham Black Barons. I like to joke that Mays was so great that he was still compiling hits at the age of 93. Indeed, he remained a hit with anyone who saw him play. Long after his career was over, Mays \u2013 when he would come back to New York \u2013 lived down the street from us in the Bronx. My Father would see him on walks and knew he had to get his autograph. Mays gave my Dad that autograph, and he kept it in his office until he passed. Mays is a big reason why my Father was one of the few people who wore a New York Giants baseball cap throughout his later years. I bought at least three of them for my Dad because he had one on his head all the time and literally wore them out. It\u2019s a connection I try to carry on to this day whether it\u2019s by wearing a New York Giants baseball hat on television or by answering \u201cthe New York Giants\u201d when asked what baseball team I root for. Now, excuse me as I go try and find that Mays autograph to honor the greatest player anyone I know saw play.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/sport/willie-mays-analysis-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_politics_fact-check-trump-rewrites-wisconsin-history", "text": "Former President Donald Trump made\u00a0more than two dozen false claims\u00a0at his Tuesday campaign rally in Racine, Wisconsin, including two significant attempts to rewrite Wisconsin history. The\u00a0first\u00a0was a slightly vaguer than usual version of his\u00a0familiar\u00a0lie that he won Wisconsin in the 2020 presidential election. He lost the state\u00a0by\u00a020,682\u00a0votes. The second was a version of a false claim Trump\u00a0delivered\u00a0in 2020 and again in 2022: his\u00a0assertion\u00a0that he had saved the Wisconsin city of Kenosha from destruction in 2020 when Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, refused to take action to deal with the civil unrest that followed the police shooting of a Black man. \u201cBy the way, you know, Kenosha: I saved Kenosha, do you know that? When I was president. Right? Right? I saved it,\u201d Trump\u00a0said\u00a0Tuesday. \u201cKenosha was \u2014 Kenosha was about ready to go down the tubes and the governor wouldn\u2019t move, he just wouldn\u2019t move, and I moved. You know, I\u2019m not supposed to; it\u2019s supposed to be the governor, is supposed to do it, the mayor and the governor.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claims that Evers \u201cwouldn\u2019t move\u201d and that Trump was the person who \u201csaved Kenosha\u201d are false, as numerous fact-checkers\u00a0pointed out\u00a0when he made similar claims\u00a0in\u00a02020. Evers, not Trump, deployed the Wisconsin National Guard during the rioting in Kenosha \u2014 and Evers first deployed the\u00a0Guard the day before Trump publicly demanded that Evers do so. In other words, Trump insisted that Evers do something that he was already doing. Trump has repeatedly made a near-identical false claim about another state, Minnesota, that had a Democratic governor and civil unrest in 2020. Though Trump has asserted that he deployed the National Guard to Minneapolis over the objection of Gov. Tim Walz,\u00a0it was Walz who deployed the\u00a0Guard to Minneapolis hours before Trump demanded that he do so. The 2020\u00a0unrest in Kenosha, which involved both peaceful protests and acts of violence and vandalism, followed the police shooting of Jacob Blake by a White police officer who was\u00a0responding to a domestic disturbance call on August 23, 2020. (State and federal law enforcement later\u00a0decided\u00a0not to file charges against the officer.) On Tuesday, after Trump repeated his false claim, the governor\u2019s office provided CNN with the same\u00a0timeline it had sent to reporters when Trump had made the claim in 2020. The timeline, which is corroborated by public evidence, conclusively debunks Trump\u2019s narrative. Trump\u00a0tweeted\u00a0on the night of August 25, 2020, that the\u00a0\u201cgovernor should call in the National Guard in Wisconsin.\u201d But the governor had already done so by then.\u00a0Evers authorized the deployment of 125 Wisconsin National Guard troops\u00a0just after 3 a.m.\u00a0the\u00a0day prior to the tweet, then\u00a0doubled\u00a0the deployment to 250 troops on the afternoon of the tweet \u2013 more than four hours before Trump weighed in. Evers continued to deploy more Wisconsin National Guard troops in the coming days, and he also\u00a0accepted\u00a0National Guard troops from three other states; they were never federalized. Evers did accept limited federal assistance from the\u00a0US Marshals Service\u00a0and the FBI, his office said, but that\u2019s no basis for Trump\u2019s claims that he saved the city when Evers wouldn\u2019t. The idea that the city\u2019s very existence was ever threatened is also\u00a0questionable, but we\u2019ll leave that aside here. Other Trump false claims Trump made lots of other false claims during the Racine rally. Here\u2019s a quick fact check on 12 of them: \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0\u201cthe world was at peace\u201d when he was president in 2020, though there\u00a0were\u00a0numerous ongoing armed conflicts. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0Democrats rigged the 2020 election, which did not happen. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0people\u2019s votes \u201ctend to disappear\u201d after they are cast, which is just not true. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0the country is \u201cin the middle of the worst crime wave in modern history,\u201d though preliminary statistics show crime\u00a0declined sharply in 2023 and the\u00a0first quarter of 2024. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0he has been indicted more times than notorious gangster Al Capone, who was\u00a0indicted at least six times to Trump\u2019s four. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0somebody left cocaine at the White House \u201cabout a month ago,\u201d though that\u00a0happened about 11 months ago, and\u00a0said\u00a0it was \u201chundreds of thousands of dollars worth of cocaine,\u201d though photos show the cocaine was in a\u00a0small bag\u00a0worth nothing even remotely close to that amount. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0he went to Washington, DC, the other day for one of his trials, though the trip\u00a0was actually for meetings with congressional Republicans. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi turned down his offer of 10,000 soldiers at the Capitol January 6, 2021; there is\u00a0no evidence she ever received such an offer, and she wouldn\u2019t have had the power to reject it if she did. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0no previous president had taken even 10 cents \u201cout of China\u201d from tariffs; the US\u00a0has had tariffs on China since the 1700s\u00a0and generated billions per year from them under predecessor President Barack Obama \u2014 and study after study has shown that Americans pay the tariffs, not China. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0Syria and Turkey have been fighting over their border \u201cfor 2,000 years,\u201d though\u00a0historians have said this is nonsense:\u00a0Turkey and Syria were both part of the Ottoman Empire, and the modern border between them is less than 100 years old. \u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0he thinks cumulative inflation under Biden is \u201c40 or 50 percent\u201d; it\u2019s\u00a0actually about 19%.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/politics/fact-check-trump-rewrites-wisconsin-history/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_politics_media-release-supreme-court-abortion", "text": "For the second time in two years, the public learned of where the Supreme Court was headed in a major abortion case before the justices had formally handed down their ruling, spoiling the court\u2019s highly controlled protocols. The circumstances around Wednesday\u2019s mistaken publishing of an apparent ruling in\u00a0an Idaho abortion case are very different from the norm-busting leak of the 2022 draft opinion\u00a0that overturned Roe v. Wade. But both disclosures showed the limits on justices\u2019 ability to roll out controversial opinions on their deliberate and custom-oriented timetable. Typically, rulings are released on pre-scheduled opinion days with no forecast ahead of time of which cases are coming down. Those mornings, the justices gather in the court to read summaries of their opinions, which are posted online shortly as hard copies are distributed to the court\u2019s dedicated press corps. Every day, agencies, businesses and organizations deal with the premature disclosure of internal information. But for the Supreme Court, it is viewed as a major departure from its culture of confidentiality if even the smallest nugget about what\u2019s going on behind the scenes makes it into public view. The leak of the 2022 opinion overturning Roe \u2013 obtained and published by Politico nearly two months before the ruling was formally handed down \u2013 was a shocking breach of the storied cone of silence around the Supreme Court\u2019s internal deliberations. It prompted endless speculation about the culprit and their political motives, with an investigation by the court\u2019s marshal unable to identify the source of the leak. The internal probe did reveal that the court had surprisingly lax systems that allowed draft opinions to circulate among a wide group of people, with gaps in the technical security that was supposed to protect the court from such exposures. While much is still not known about how a version of the Idaho case ruling was accidentally posted online, it nonetheless comes as tensions at the court are running high, as the justices scramble to catch up with a backlog of undecided cases. The case in dispute is over whether Idaho can enforce its abortion ban in situations of serious emergency pregnancy complications that do not threaten the pregnant person\u2019s life. The Supreme Court officially handed down the ruling on Thursday, after the court accidentally posted to its website a version of the opinion on Wednesday that was obtained and reported by Bloomberg. The\u00a0majority opted to dismiss the case as \u201cimprovidently granted\u201d \u2013 a move that allows the justices to duck the case\u2019s legal questions while more proceedings play out at lower courts. The ruling, if and when formally handed down, means that an order from a trial judge that had blocked enforcement of Idaho\u2019s abortion ban in medical emergencies will now go back into effect. After the mistaken posting of the opinion Wednesday, Supreme Court\u2019s public affairs office acknowledged that a \u201cdocument\u201d was \u201cinadvertently and briefly uploaded\u201d by the court\u2019s \u201cpublication unit.\u201d \u201cThe Court\u2019s opinion in\u00a0Moyle v. United States\u00a0and\u00a0Idaho v. United States\u00a0will be issued in due course,\u201d court spokesperson Patricia McCabe said Wednesday, referring to the names of the consolidated case. IT hiccups haunt the Supreme Court It appears that the posting of the\u00a0opinion Wednesday to the court\u2019s website was the result of a technological mess-up that was easily traced back to the court and one that made the opinion public only a day before its official release. That sets it apart from the leak of the draft opinion reversing Roe, in a case known as Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization. The disclosure seemed to be a purposeful move to get the opinion into the public domain. It happened several weeks before the final ruling came down, while the draft was still being polished and \u2013 perhaps \u2013 votes were not finalized. Still, both instances highlighted how things can fall through the cracks even at the country\u2019s most opaque government institution and how 21st century technology can outpace the court\u2019s practices. While the investigation into the Dobbs leak did not determine how the opinion got out, it revealed stunning lapses in the court\u2019s informational security. At least 90 people had access to the draft, according to the marshal\u2019s report. The probe found no indications of a hack, but the report said that there were issues with the court\u2019s IT system that hindered the investigation. Follow-up reporting by CNN revealed that justices were known to use personal emails to send sensitive communications and that so-called \u201cburn bags\u201d to dispose sensitive physical documents went unused. Court employees we also able to print court documents on devices that did not create the \u201clogs\u201d meant to track the printing of documents. Earlier this term, an IT hiccup gave the public another unintended glimpse into how a separate blockbuster case came together. The case, a unanimous ruling in favor of former President Donald Trump\u2019s challenge to Colorado\u2019s removal of him from its ballot, featured a concurrence authored jointly by the three liberals. But metadata from the opinion showed that the concurrence started out as a partial dissent, authored by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, suggesting that it was a last-minute shift in the votes that got all nine justices signed on to the unanimous opinion. This story has been updated following the official release of the abortion ruling Thursday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/politics/media-release-supreme-court-abortion/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_politics_autoworkers-michigan-biden-trump", "text": "Walter Robinson Jr. bets about 40% of his Ford Motor Company co-workers are for Donald Trump. He doesn\u2019t get it. \u201cDonald Trump has never had a real job before,\u201d said Robinson, a 35-year Ford employee who started on the assembly line and now works in quality control.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s never come in there and shot six bolts and put in four push pins 600 times a day on the assembly line.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s never shoveled crap,\u201d Robinson continued. \u201cHe\u2019s never done a hard day\u2019s work. Not physical work like you do in the plant. And he has a solid gold toilet at home. So, I mean, how can he really empathize with your life?\u201d Sometimes Robinson joins the debate along the assembly line or in the break room, pointing out President Joe Biden\u2019s long history of supporting organized labor, including his decision to join striking United Auto Workers on the picket line in Michigan during their six-week strike last year. The UAW endorsed Biden earlier this year. The retort? \u201cYou, know: guns, gays, abortion, sleepy Joe, Hunter Biden,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cThey just tell me these outlandish things that they think are important. \u2026 If Hunter Biden is such a big issue, why isn\u2019t Jared Kushner a big issue?\u201d The\u00a0autoworkers strike, which ended late last year, was a big win for the UAW.\u00a0Robinson\u00a0got a nice raise and cost of living adjustments were restored in the deal. The bigger gains went to less experienced UAW members hired after the 2008 financial crisis, when the automakers said their only path to survival was a two-tier wage and benefits system that paid new workers less. \u201cI think we got more than I thought we would,\u201d Robinson said in an interview during his lunch break at the UAW Local 900 headquarters across the street from a giant Ford assembly plant. But it didn\u2019t solve everything. \u201cGas prices are still pretty high,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just me and my wife and it\u2019s $200 every time I go to the grocery store.\u201d We met Robinson as part of a CNN project tracking the 2024 election through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in presidential battleground states and are part of key voting blocs. UAW membership is way down from Detroit\u2019s heyday, but at roughly 134,000 members in Michigan now, the union remains a political force in this swing state, which Biden won by less than 3 points in 2020 after Trump won it by less than a point four years earlier. Robinson believes the UAW leadership has improved its standing with the rank and file because of the contract gains. But he is skeptical that the UAW endorsement of Biden will sway many of his union colleagues who back Trump. \u201cYou have people in there, in the plant, who don\u2019t want to be told what to do,\u201d Robinson said. Blue-collar voters looking for politicians who understand them People like Bill Govier\u00a0from Wixom, Michigan. \u201cI love my job,\u201d said Govier, a 25-year Ford employee and UAW member who started on the assembly line and now works as a millwright. \u201cAs a skilled tradesman, I definitely love my job.\u201d Govier calls himself\u00a0\u201ca little more on the conservative side, but really close to the middle.\u201d He voted for Trump in both 2016 and 2020. \u201cI\u2019m probably more tolerant than I have ever been, but the powers that be label me as some far-right White supremacist MAGA Republican,\u201d he said. Govier also bristles at how critics label Trump. \u201cEverybody wants to say, \u2018Oh he said this, it\u2019s the nastiest thing ever.\u2019 Stop, just stop. Quit taking things out of context, read the whole thing, listen to the whole thing,\u201d Govier said. \u201cI just don\u2019t see him as the anti-Christ, or Hitler. That\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d Govier described his 2016 vote this way: \u201cI don\u2019t trust Hillary (Clinton) . \u2026 I voted against Hillary more so than for Trump.\u201d In 2020, he said he \u201cliked where the country was going,\u201d praising the pre-Covid Trump economy and how the then-president handled relations with North Korea. Now, Govier said, \u201cI\u2019m leaning away from Biden more than for Trump.\u201d Govier makes a point we hear a lot from blue-collar voters in our travels. \u201cI don\u2019t think there are a lot of people in this country under the age of 40 that really understand what it is like to work with your hands,\u201d Govier said. \u201cMost of the politicians I don\u2019t think understand it.\u00a0\u2026 So, it is hard for guys like us to feel represented properly.\u201d Before committing to vote for Trump in 2024, Govier said he wants to research independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. But he said he would be hesitant to vote third party if he believed it might help Biden. \u201cI would really rather have Kennedy,\u201d he said. But if voting for him boosts Biden, he added, \u201cI might have to vote for Trump.\u201d Chris Vitale has no hesitation about his 2024 choice: he will proudly vote for Trump a third time. \u201cI\u2019m sort of the hands of the engineer,\u201d is how he describes his job doing mechanical work in the engine development shop at Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler. He is a 30-year Chrysler employee and 30-year UAW member. Vitale blames Democrats for his Trump support. Gone from the party, he says, are people like former Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, who twice unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination, first in 1988. \u201cHe raised a lot of midwestern manufacturing concerns with NAFTA and things like that,\u201d Vitale said of Gephardt. \u201cSo what happened to those Democrats? Those are the Democrats I wanted to vote for. They\u2019re gone now.\u201d Vitale said he initially viewed Trump as \u201cjust another distraction, a sideshow or something\u201d early in the 2016 race. But then he heard Trump talk tough on trade and promise to revive American manufacturing. \u201cI\u2019ve watched this region go from the arsenal of democracy,\u201d Vitale said. \u201cI watched it go from that realm of importance to now we\u2019re happy we can get a sports stadium or we\u2019re going to sell weed or fireworks. It\u2019s absolutely pathetic what we have sunk to and our politicians, they\u2019re good with it. He isn\u2019t. So that is the difference.\u201d Vitale said Biden policies that he argues are hurting the industry are more important to him than the president\u2019s decision to show up at a UAW picket line. \u201cI think the government seems to be appeasing the coasts,\u201d Vitale said during an interview in St. Clair Shores, a town in battleground Macomb County just north of Detroit. \u201cYou know, everyone who lives in Manhattan thinks everyone should drive an electric car. Everyone who lives in Los Angeles thinks the world is coming to an end and you can\u2019t have any more internal combustion engine cars. \u2026 The middle of the country, which used to be the manufacturing base of this country, doesn\u2019t feel that way, doesn\u2019t operate that way. So there is a huge divide.\u201d Vitale said a Trump win would mean an end to requirements for automakers to sell more EVs and, he believes, trade policies designed to protect American jobs. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the government against us at every turn,\u201d Vitale said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe the people who are responsible for regulating our industries are so out of tune with our industries.\u201d Union leadership\u2019s endorsement only goes so far Bob King sees a profound disconnect between Trump\u2019s words and actions \u2013 or inactions \u2013 and he hopes the UAW leadership hones in on that as it sells its endorsement of Biden over the final five months of the campaign. King worked at Ford for more than 40 years and was UAW president for four years during the Obama presidency, when the auto industry \u2013 and the UAW \u2013 were reeling from the 2008 global financial crisis. That is when the two-tiered contracts went into effect, and King sees both a financial and a psychological hit that caused disaffection among blue collar workers \u2013 and ultimately drove many to Trump. \u201cThey are listening because they don\u2019t believe anybody has delivered for them,\u201d King said in an interview. \u201cPeople feel like the establishment hasn\u2019t been delivering for them. Is your life better now than it was 10 years ago? For many working people, it is worse. Their standard of living has deteriorated. In some cases, their communities have deteriorated.\u201d The new contract, King argues, erases most of the concessions made after the financial crisis and, in his view, should boost the standing of the current UAW leadership as it makes the case Biden is better than Trump for union workers. Tonya Rincon isn\u2019t so sure of that. \u201cThe leadership gives their advice and their official endorsement and in the rank and file it goes about 50-50,\u201d said Rincon, a 30-year Ford worker and UAW member. \u201cAnd it will probably go 50-50 this time.\u201d Perhaps, she said, the president\u2019s decision to visit the picket line will help a tad. \u201cMaybe it will move a small percentage and Michigan is a state where small percentages matter,\u201d she said in an interview in the Local 900 union hall. \u201cSo maybe it will be 51-49. But I don\u2019t think it moved a lot of people.\u201d Rincon is committed to Biden. \u201cBecause I think he does care about working men and women,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat he is doing for our kids, with helping to arrest out-of-control student debt. \u2026 Everything he stands for. It aligns with my values. So he has my support.\u201d Objections to Biden among Ford colleagues include the administration\u2019s aggressive support of shifting to EVs. Rincon disagrees with that critique. \u201cI think we should have as many options for drivers as they want to have,\u201d Rincon said. \u201cWe need to build cars and we need to paint them and put them on drive trains, regardless of what kind of engine they have. So it is not going to cost us jobs.\u201d Like Robinson, she rolls her eyes at colleagues who say Trump understands them better. \u201cHe\u2019s stiffed working men and women his entire business career,\u201d Rincon said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t understand that.\u201d But she went on, like King, to suggest some of Trump\u2019s support stems from worries among voters that growing up in communities like Wayne isn\u2019t as safe a bet as it once was. \u201cI didn\u2019t go to college after high school,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I bummed around working a bunch of crappy retail jobs and service jobs. \u2026 And then I lucked out, started a family and needed a good paying job. So I got into the plant.\u201d But that path to middle class security isn\u2019t as guaranteed as it once was. \u201cFor about the last 15 years that hasn\u2019t really been the reality,\u201d Rincon said, because of the two-tier wage and benefits system. \u201cPeople were making as little working on the line now as I made 30 years ago when I started, which is kind of crazy. So people still wanted to get to the Big Three [automakers], but the reality was they weren\u2019t making a realistic living.\u201d The new contract fixed some of those issues, and Rincon said morale is better inside the plant. \u201cIt mattered,\u201d she said, that Biden came out to support the strikers. But did it change the conversation about the president? \u201cInside the plants?\u201d Rincon said. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it did.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/politics/autoworkers-michigan-biden-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_politics_idaho-abortion-supreme-court", "text": "The Supreme Court formally dismissed an appeal over Idaho\u2019s strict abortion ban on Thursday, blocking enforcement of the state\u2019s law a day after the opinion was inadvertently posted on the court\u2019s website in an astonishing departure from its highly controlled protocols. At issue in the case was a state law that banned abortions except for the life of the pregnant woman. The Biden administration argued that a federal law required hospitals to also provide abortions in cases where the health of a pregnant woman is at stake. The unsigned opinion drew a flurry of concurrences from conservative and liberal justices, who formed an unusual alliance to dismiss the case and temporarily block enforcement of Idaho\u2019s strict ban. Though the decision was technically a loss for Idaho, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson stressed in a partial dissent that the potential impact is likely to be short-lived. \u201cToday\u2019s decision is not a victory for pregnant patients in Idaho,\u201d Jackson wrote. \u201cIt is delay.\u201d The decision sweeps abortion off the Supreme Court\u2019s docket in the middle of a highly contested presidential election, even though the issue is almost certain to return to the justices. Earlier this month, the court dispensed with another abortion case, an appeal challenging expanded access to the abortion pill mifepristone. There, a unanimous court held that the anti-abortion doctors and groups who sued did not have standing. Almost as notable as the Idaho decision itself was the fact that the public received an early glimpse of the outcome when a version of the opinion was inadvertently posted online briefly.

{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_kfile-jd-vance-harsh-twitter-likes-trump-vice-president", "text": "Republican Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, a leading candidate to be Donald Trump\u2019s vice president, liked tweets in 2016 and 2017 that harshly criticized Trump and his policies \u2014 including one speculating that Vance could serve in former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s administration. Other tweets liked by Vance said Trump committed \u201cserial sexual assault,\u201d called him \u201cone of USA\u2019s most hated, villainous, douchey celebs,\u201d and, in a since-removed set of tweets, harshly criticized Trump\u2019s response to the deadly 2017 White nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia \u2013 something Vance now defends Trump over. Vance\u2019s past anti-Trump stances have been well-documented, but these new examples, unearthed by an extensive review of Vance\u2019s past social media activity, demonstrate they were more widespread and scathing than previously known. Their discovery also comes as Vance has solidified his standing in Trump\u2019s inner circle as a frequent defender of the former president and is among a handful of people under consideration to be Trump\u2019s vice-presidential pick. As CNN\u2019s KFile previously reported, Vance deleted past anti-Trump tweets ahead of his announcement in July 2021 that he would run for the open Ohio Senate seat. Vance once\u00a0privately wondered whether Trump was \u2018America\u2019s Hitler\u2019 in February 2016, and a few months later wrote in The Atlantic that Trump was \u201ccultural heroin.\u201d Vance also said he even contemplated voting for Clinton, but ultimately said he would vote for independent candidate Evan McMullin for president in 2016. Once regarded as a \u201cTrump whisperer\u201d for his understanding of the aggrieved White working class and a self-described \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republican, Vance shot to fame over his memoir, \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d published in June 2016. Vance was a frequent guest on cable news programs and later became a CNN contributor in 2017. His subsequent transition from vocal Trump critic to staunch supporter has been widely scrutinized. Vance has become a key surrogate for the former president and routinely defends Trump on television, including during his hush money trial in New York last month. Vance also helped orchestrate Trump\u2019s June 6 fundraiser in San Francisco with tech industry donors. Trump is expected to meet with congressional Republicans in Washington, DC, on Thursday. In a statement to CNN, Vance cited Trump\u2019s \u201cmany successes in office\u201d and claimed that realizing the \u201ccorporate media and Deep State\u2019s\u201d coordinated efforts to undermine Trump changed his perspective. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be one of his strongest supporters in the Senate today and I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to ensure President Trump wins in November - the survival of America depends on it.\u201d Prior to the publication of this story, Vance\u2019s communications director sent along two supportive statements from Donald Trump Jr. and Jason Miller, a senior advisor to the Trump campaign. Trump Jr. criticized news outlets for repeatedly covering Vance\u2019s past anti-Trump comments writing, \u201cWe\u2019re 100% confident that JD is America First to the core\u201d and \u201cno one in the Senate has been a stronger supporter of my father.\u201d Trump Jr. added they were \u201clong past all of this,\u201d saying they had \u201cdiscussed it with him at length.\u201d Miller wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that politics is ultimately politics,\u201d and likened Vance\u2019s past criticism to criticism by Kamala Harris of Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential primary over his past opposition to desegregation busing in the 1970s. In an interview published Thursday, Vance told New York Times columnist Ross Douthat about his political conversion to a pro-Trump Republican. \u201cLike a lot of other elite conservatives and elite liberals, I allowed myself to focus so much on the stylistic element of Trump that I completely ignored the way in which he substantively was offering something very different on foreign policy, on trade, on immigration,\u201d Vance said. Anti-Trump social media activity from 2016 CNN reviewed Vance\u2019s past likes on Twitter, the platform now known as X, before X changed its policy to make users\u2019 likes private and hidden from others. A majority of the newly uncovered social media activity dates from the last five months of the 2016 presidential campaign. They include Vance liking a number of anti-Trump posts on Twitter, including those criticizing Trump\u2019s immigration policies, acknowledging antisemitism from Trump supporters, questioning the integrity of voting for Trump over Clinton and even raising concerns over Trump having access to the country\u2019s nuclear codes as president. In February 2016, Vance liked a tweet featuring a photo of Trump, two women and O.J. Simpson with the caption, \u201cHere is an old picture of one of USA\u2019s most hated, villainous, douchey celebs. Also in picture: OJ Simpson.\u201d Vance also liked tweets from August 2016 that praised his book and envisioned a role for him in a potential Clinton administration and another tweet suggesting he could provide Clinton with the \u201cseeds to a plan to defeat Trump.\u201d But Vance soon began liking several tweets with the hashtag #NeverHillary through October 2016. While promoting his memoir and appearing on news programs in 2016, Vance liked a series of tweets calling then-candidate Trump a \u201cmonster\u201d and a \u201cnemesis of the GOP.\u201d He also liked a tweet acknowledging \u201cthreats and derogatory terms Trump supporters hurl at Jews.\u201d He even liked a tweet from CNN anchor Jake Tapper criticizing Trump\u2019s tweet about a woman\u2019s appearance amidst then-first lady Melania Trump\u2019s campaign against cyberbullying. He also liked a tweet that read, \u201cDoes any dad (or future dad) want to look his daughter in the eye and explain why he voted for Trump instead of 1st woman president?\u201d Among the harshest tweets Vance liked was one that called out Trump after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape surfaced, capturing previously unaired lewd and sexually aggressive remarks by the presidential nominee. \u201cMaybe the Central Park 5 could take out a full-page ad to condemn the coddling of thug real estate barons who commit serial sexual assault,\u201d the tweet read. Other tweets Vance engaged with criticized signature Trump policies, including Trump\u2019s hardline position on immigration and the tax cuts from 2017. In August 2017, Vance criticized Trump\u2019s response to the White supremacist violence in Charlottesville earlier that year, linking in a since-deleted tweet to a TV segment that called Trump a \u201ccoward\u201d for his response, and then liked a tweet indicating he did not consistently support the GOP or Trump. \u201cThere is no moral equivalence between the anti-racist protestors in Charlottesville and the killer (and his ilk),\u201d Vance wrote, while also criticizing left-wing violence. \u201cYou may not like @JDVance1\u2019s view - but it\u2019s hard to pin him down as consistently supporting views of either Trump or GOP,\u201d read the tweet Vance liked. Pro-Trump pivot Despite his earlier harsh criticism of Trump, by 2021, Vance dismissed left-wing condemnation of Trump\u2019s comments \u2014 where Trump equated White nationalist protestors and counter-protestors as \u201cfine people on both sides\u201d\u2014 as \u201cthe ridiculous race hoax in Charlottesville.\u201d Ahead of his Senate campaign that year, Vance apologized for previously calling Trump \u201creprehensible,\u201d in tweets first uncovered by CNN\u2019s KFile. \u201cLike a lot of people, I criticized Trump back in 2016,\u201d Vance told CNN in 2021. \u201cI regret being wrong about the guy,\u201d Vance said, adding he thought Trump was a good president. In a previously unreported blog post Vance wrote in April 2010 under his previous legal name, J.D. Hamel, he wrote in support of legal immigration, advocating to \u201cmassively increase\u201d the number of migrants allowed into the country. \u201cBorder security is a good start, but if we plan to control the border, then we must also plan to massively increase the number of legal migrants allowed into the country,\u201d Vance wrote. \u201cThe day that America no longer welcomes decent, hardworking foreign nationals is the day that our nation loses something very central to its character and its economic diversity.\u201d Vance told CNN, \u201cIt was a stupid opinion from 15 years ago when I was in my twenties. All anyone needs to do is check my voting record as a Senator to see that I have consistently opposed increased immigration levels into America.\u201d Vance said in September 2016 that Trump\u2019s immigration policies were overly simplistic. \u201cAt the heart of Trump\u2019s immigration message is that if we had less immigration, we would have much better jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a lot more complicated than that. My own sense is that Trump definitely simplifies these problems. I don\u2019t think if you build a great Mexican wall, all of a sudden, all of these steel mill jobs are going to come back to southern Ohio, but it at least gives people something to latch onto.\u201d Three months ago, Vance reiterated his support for Trump\u2019s immigration policies. In an interview on Fox Business Vance said, \u201cIf we don\u2019t get control of the southern border \u2013 tens of millions of illegal aliens are now in our country, tons of fentanyl killing over 100,000 people \u2013 we don\u2019t have a country anymore if we don\u2019t get control of that border.\u201d This story has been updated with more information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/kfile-jd-vance-harsh-twitter-likes-trump-vice-president/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_politics_wisconsin-supreme-court-abortion-draft-order-leaks", "text": "The chief justice of the Wisconsin Supreme Court called for an investigation Wednesday after the leak of a draft order that showed the court would take a case brought by Planned Parenthood that seeks to declare that access to abortion is a right protected by the state constitution. Chief Justice Annette Ziegler called for the investigation after Wisconsin Watch reported on the draft order that it obtained. The order as reported by Wisconsin Watch said the court would hear the court challenge, but it was not a ruling on the case itself. \u201cToday the entire court was shocked to learn that a confidential draft document was ostensibly leaked to the press,\u201d Zielger said in a statement. \u201cI have contacted law enforcement to request that a full investigation be conducted.\u201d She said all seven justices were \u201cunited behind this investigation to identify the source of the apparent leak. The seven of us condemn this breach.\u201d Ziegler is part of a three-justice conservative minority on the court. The draft order did not indicate which justices were in favor of accepting the abortion case, and there were no dissents indicated, according to Wisconsin Watch. Planned Parenthood brought the lawsuit in February. It asks the Wisconsin Supreme Court to overturn a 175-year-old state law that conservatives have interpreted as an abortion ban. That is the second abortion-related lawsuit before the court. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has not said whether it will accept the appeal of a lower court ruling won by Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul. He challenged the 1849 law as too old to enforce and trumped by a 1985 law that allows abortions up to the point when a fetus could survive outside the womb. Dane County Circuit Judge Diane Schlipper ruled last year that the law only prohibits attacking a woman with the intent to kill her unborn child. The decision emboldened Planned Parenthood to resume offering abortions in Wisconsin after stopping procedures in response to the US Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade. Sheboygan County District Attorney Joel Urmanski, a Republican, has appealed and asked the state Supreme Court to take the case directly without waiting for a lower appellate ruling. The draft order in the Planned Parenthood case did not address the other lawsuit, according to Wisconsin Watch. The abortion cases are among the highest profile before the court that flipped to liberal control in 2023. The court in December threw out Republican-drawn legislative maps, handing Democrats a huge win that resulted in the Legislature adopting new boundaries drawn by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. The court has also heard a lawsuit that would restore the use of absentee ballot drop boxes, a closely watched case in battleground Wisconsin. A ruling on that case is expected soon given that the court\u2019s term ends next week.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/politics/wisconsin-supreme-court-abortion-draft-order-leaks/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_politics_georgia-battleground-biden-trump", "text": "The headwinds facing President Joe Biden\u2019s reelection bid are as apparent in Georgia as any battleground. So, too, are the questions of whether Donald Trump can capitalize on them. The president and his predecessor are set to face off in a historic CNN debate Thursday night in Atlanta \u2014 the first for either man since the 2020 election. It\u2019s taking place in one of the nation\u2019s most competitive swing states, and a rare example of a Republican electorate that did not side with Trump as he sought to punish those who refused to support his false claims of widespread election fraud. \u201cPresident Trump still has to earn these Republican voters,\u201d said Kelvin King, who was among Trump\u2019s most prominent Black supporters in Georgia in 2016 and 2020. \u201cHe can win, but he\u2019s got to earn it.\u201d King, who met with Republicans in all of Georgia\u2019s 159 counties during an unsuccessful bid for\u00a0US\u00a0Senate in 2022, said\u00a0he has come\u00a0to the realization that Trump should spend far more time articulating his ideas for the future than relitigating the past. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a bucket of water with a hole in it.\u00a0He\u2019s\u00a0trying to find new voters to fill up this bucket, but there\u2019s a hole that\u2019s leaking a lot of Republicans out,\u201d\u00a0said King, who founded a political outreach group, Let\u2019s Win for America, to spread a conservative message to minority voters.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s going to have to plug that hole.\u201d Four years ago, Biden defeated Trump by 11,779 votes out of 5 million cast \u2013 the first time a Democratic presidential candidate carried Georgia in nearly three decades. Unable to accept his loss, Georgia became an early epicenter of\u00a0Trump\u2019s\u00a0election denialism\u00a0\u2014 eventually leading to criminal charges against the former president. In 2022, he backed primary challenges against Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger\u00a0after they didn\u2019t go along with his efforts to overturn the 2020\u00a0results \u2014 but both easily fended off those Trump-backed rivals and won reelection. How the former president\u00a0balances his complaints about the last election with his plans for the next one\u00a0could help determine how competitive the state remains heading into the fall campaign. \u201cRe-litigation is not going to drive people to the polls,\u201d King said, \u201cat least not the folks in the middle, the votes that we need.\u201d Biden spending big in Georgia The Biden campaign and its allied groups have spent $16.5 million here on advertising \u2013 nearly five times as much as Republicans, which Democrats say is a sign they are committed to trying to win the state again in November. Mirroring the themes both campaigns have focused on nationally, the Biden ads have cast Trump as a threat to democracy and highlighted the former president\u2019s legal troubles. \u201cThis election is between a convicted criminal who\u2019s only out for himself and a president who\u2019s fighting for your family,\u201d a narrator says in one spot. The pro-Trump group Securing American Greatness hammers Biden for inflation. \u201cAtlanta rent is way up, food prices soaring to record highs but Biden claims he\u2019s lowering costs. Is it dishonesty or dementia?\u201d a narrator says. One part insurance policy, one part viable path, the Biden team is blanketing the state in the days leading up to Thursday\u2019s debate with 200 events across Georgia. \u201cWe\u2019ve never not shown up to vote. This year it won\u2019t be any different,\u201d said Keisha Lance Bottoms, a former Atlanta mayor who also worked in the White House as a senior adviser to Biden. \u201cWe\u2019re going to show up and I believe President Biden will win Georgia again.\u201d Asked if the race was more difficult the second time around, she said: \u201cElections aren\u2019t ever easy, but the choice is clear.\u201d \u2018It\u2019s not worse!\u2019 The CNN debate on Thursday between Biden and Trump \u2013 the earliest general election debate in memory \u2013 has captured the attention of Atlanta voters like\u00a0Democrat\u00a0Mariama Davis, who said she has high hopes for Biden\u2019s chances in November. \u201cYou know what you\u2019re getting with Joe Biden,\u201d Davis said in an interview in her store, the Beehive. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t pull any punches. He\u2019s a straight shooter and I\u2019m happy to see more of the same.\u201d Asked whether she was better off today than four years ago, Davis paused and answered with careful deliberation. She said she appreciated the student loan forgiveness from the Biden administration as well as other assistance programs during the pandemic recovery. \u201cThey feel pretty much the same,\u201d Davis said, quickly adding: \u201cIt\u2019s not worse! It\u2019s not worse!\u201d While it\u2019s hardly the slogan the Biden campaign is banking on, it taps into a sentiment often expressed by supporters like Davis. Her small business, like so many others, has been on an economic roller coaster ride. \u201cHow has inflation affected our business? It\u2019s affected our business like it\u2019s affected all businesses,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIf people have the choice to buy eggs or food or gifts, we still expect them to buy food for their families. But our doors are still open so we\u2019re grateful for that.\u201d Paths to 270 electoral votes Georgia is among the battlegrounds Trump is trying to win back, along with Arizona, while also targeting Nevada, which he lost twice. Biden could lose all three and still win reelection, if he holds the \u201cblue wall\u201d of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, as well as a single electoral vote in Nebraska. To keep all pathways open, Democrats are making big investments in Georgia. More than a dozen campaign offices have opened\u00a0in the state, including one that Vice President Kamala Harris christened last week. \u201cThrough this office right here, we will gather, we will organize, we will build community, we will build a coalition,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThere is power in the collective and in our unity.\u201d That fraying coalition is one of the most pressing challenges facing the Biden campaign. \u201cYoung voters have a lot of homework to do,\u201d said Kerry Singleton Jr., who graduated from Morehouse College last month. He was among the students who voiced frustration at the administration for failing to deliver on all of its promises, telling CNN last year: \u201cAs we hold Trump accountable, we have to hold Biden accountable.\u201d But after hearing the president deliver the commencement address at Morehouse College and focusing more acutely on the choice in November, Singleton now sees it differently. \u201cMy disagreements previously do not matter as much as the two people that we have as choices here,\u201d Singleton said. \u201cTo me, former President Donald Trump just isn\u2019t an option whatsoever.\u201d The question is whether Singleton stands alone or represents a broader view among young voters. Looming over the contest is how engaged the state\u2019s Black voters become in the race and whether Biden or Trump deliver a debate performance that moves an otherwise stagnant campaign less than five months before Election Day. Asked whether he\u2019s worried about Trump winning, Singleton replied: \u201cAbsolutely. If he\u2019s elected, that\u2019s a very scary feeling as a young Black male.\u201d CORRECTION: This story has been updated to accurately reflect the name of the Georgia political outreach group founded by Kelvin King.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/politics/georgia-battleground-biden-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_politics_immigration-policy-biden-what-matters", "text": "In two weeks, the White House has swerved from taking tough action against asylum-seekers trying to enter the country illegally to taking strong action to show empathy for people who have lived for years in the US immigration shadows. It was in early June that President Joe Biden pulled from former President Donald Trump\u2019s playbook to severely limit protections for asylum-seekers who cross the border illegally, effectively trying to seal the border to them, and addressing a changing mood in the country with regard to asylum-seekers. That move angered many progressives and immigration advocates and drew a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union. But those groups will now cheer Biden\u2019s move Tuesday, offering new protection to hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants \u2013 specifically some spouses of US citizens and their children \u2013 who are already in the US. The move could grant legal status to about 500,000 American families, according to the White House. Biden promises empathy; Trump promises mass deportation The new executive action offers a major contrast with Trump, who is promising to deport more than 10 million people from the US if he\u2019s elected to a second term. At the White House, Biden argued Trump\u2019s deportation policy would \u201crip spouses and children from their families, homes and communities and place them in detention camps.\u201d From CNN\u2019s report by Michael Williams: Under current federal law, an undocumented person who enters the United States and marries a US citizen must first request parole before applying for legal residency. That process requires them to leave the country if they were there illegally, upending their careers and families and creating uncertainty about whether they would be authorized to reenter.  Tuesday\u2019s action allows those spouses to apply for residency without needing to leave the United States \u2013 a key change that the Biden administration argues will keep families intact. Read Williams\u2019 full report. Undocumented immigrants eligible for the program will have to apply, but they can stay in the US as the process unfolds. The must have been married by June 17, before the new action was announced, and they must have been in the US for at least 10 years. Is this necessary? One Biden critic argued the new policy is unnecessary since few long-standing undocumented immigrants who are married to a US citizen would ever be deported. \u201cI\u2019m trying to understand the problem that the Biden administration is trying to solve here, and I just don\u2019t see it,\u201d Chad Wolf, an acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security during the Trump administration, said on CNN. He did not address Trump\u2019s deportation pledge during the interview. Seeking \u2018balance\u2019 Rep. Adriano Espaillat, a New York Democrat who is the first former undocumented immigrant elected to Congress, told CNN\u2019s Brianna \ufeffKeilar that while he does not support the asylum action announced earlier this month, the addition of protection for undocumented spouses and their children \u201cbalances that out in a real smart way.\u201d He argued the immigration debate is too large for one single fix. \u201cJust to do (border) enforcement or just to do what we\u2019re doing today alone is not an answer to the vast majority of the American people that are concerned about this,\u201d Espaillat said. \u201cThe immigration debate is very broad,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated, and these are very specific items within that broader debate that are being addressed.\u201d Legal limbo Biden\u2019s move could also lack permanence. An important caveat to any immigration action is that since Congress continually fails to address the immigration issue, anything a president does with executive power might be reversed by the next administration or invalidated by courts. Look no further than the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program enacted by the Obama administration in June 2012, another strong executive action positioned for effect in an election year. Still proud of that policy, Biden announced his new program in conjunction with the 12th anniversary of DACA. Obama enacted DACA; Trump tried to end it The DACA policy was enacted after bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform efforts failed for the umpteenth time. It was meant to bring people brought to the US illegally as children, frequently referred to as \u201cDreamers,\u201d out of the shadows and allow them to build lives in the country where they grew up. Nearly 600,000 people have sought protected status under the program, which defers but does not necessarily end any immigration action against them. The Trump administration tried to end the DACA program in 2017, but the effort eventually failed at the Supreme Court in 2020. Instead, Trump hit pause on new applications, something the Biden administration then reversed. Would today\u2019s Supreme Court protect DACA? After the Biden administration tried to formalize the DACA process, a federal judge in 2021 agreed with Texas and other states that the program must be ended, again halting new DACA applications. That case is now under appeal and could land the DACA issue back at the Supreme Court. When a divided 5-4 court prevented the Trump administration from ending DACA in 2020,  Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liberal justice, was still on the court. She has been replaced by a conservative, Justice Amy Coney Barrett. In 2020, Chief Justice John Roberts infuriated conservatives by joining the liberal block of justices to rule against Trump on technical grounds. The new case and the new makeup of the court mean DACA is far from safe. Congress could, of course, fix all of this with action, but it has failed to pass comprehensive reform despite attempts that go back decades. The much more modest bipartisan effort pushed by Biden earlier this year would not have helped the undocumented spouses of citizens and their children.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/politics/immigration-policy-biden-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_politics_presidential-debate-history-what-matters", "text": "CNN\u2019s presidential debate will feel like something new for most Americans, but it is actually a return to the roots of presidential debates. Rather than a forum sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, which had organized all general election presidential debates since 1988, the meeting Thursday between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will be hosted by CNN but simulcast on some other networks. CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper and Dana Bash will moderate the meeting at CNN\u2019s Atlanta studio and, unlike commission debates, there will be no live audience. That TV studio format is not unlike the first televised presidential debates in 1960 between then-Sen. John F. Kennedy and then-Vice President Richard Nixon. There was a series of four televised debates in September and October of 1960, all of which occurred in TV studios, although one featured Nixon in a Los Angeles studio and Kennedy in New York, according to a history maintained by the commission. Those first debates were the brain child of network TV executives, according to Alan Schroeder, professor emeritus of journalism at Northeastern University and author of \u201cPresidential Debates: Risky Business on the Campaign Trail.\u201d Kennedy is generally viewed as the winner of the 1960 debates, in part because of his comfort on camera. Nixon, meanwhile, did not wear makeup, did not practice the debate format and did not look like himself after a stay in the hospital due to a knee injury, Schroeder told me in a phone conversation. Nixon learned his lesson, and there were no debates for his subsequent White House runs in 1968 and 1972. The next presidential debates did not take place until 1976, when Nixon\u2019s successor, Gerald Ford, was in a similar position to Biden today. According to Schroeder, \u201che was looking for something dramatic to break the logjam\u201d of poor polling for the Republican after taking over the presidency following Nixon\u2019s Watergate-related resignation. During his speech to the Republican National Convention that year, Ford issued a challenge to Jimmy Carter to debate. But the gamble backfired when Ford flubbed an answer related to the Soviet Union dominating Eastern Europe. Carter was able to appear qualified and capable in front of a massive audience. That\u2019s a very different dynamic from today, when Americans have already experienced both a Biden and a Trump presidency. Four years later, Carter was less excited to debate. He skipped a forum featuring the Republican candidate, Ronald Reagan, and an independent candidate, John Anderson, and took part in only one debate with Reagan. Ultimately, the commission was formed to create a nonpartisan framework for presidential debates \u2013 something that has been exported to other countries. Schroeder said that while he preferred the old system of debates organized by the commission, it would make sense for campaigns to want to have more control over the process. The TV studio format will allow Biden to sidestep \u201cthe distraction of boisterous Trump supporters interrupting, carrying on with loud applause or laughing, all those things that that happen when you have a live audience, and particularly a very politicized live audience,\u201d Schroeder said. Another model for debates, from the pre-Civil War era, relied on massive live audiences and featured Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas. But the so-called Lincoln-Douglas debates did not take place during the 1860 presidential election, when the two were both candidates and when Lincoln won the White House. Instead, the debates occurred in 1858, and focused on the issue of slavery when the two men were running for Senate in Illinois. Douglas kept the Illinois Senate seat, but the debates gave Lincoln a national profile and helped him on the way to the White House. Don\u2019t expect a Lincoln-Douglas-style debate on TV. While more than 10,000 people attended most of the debates, held in locations across Illinois, they would seem extremely long-winded for someone with a 21st century attention span. The first speaker would get a 60-minute opening statement. The second got a 90-minute response. And the first speaker got a final 30-minute rebuttal. CNN\u2019s entire debate will last 90 minutes and include two commercial breaks. It will not feature opening statements, although each candidate will get a closing statement. After a coin toss, Biden is set to give the first closing statement and Trump will go last. Read more about the debate setup. The debate will be watched live by millions on CNN and other TV networks, but unlike the Kennedy-Nixon debates, it will continue to be digested by potential voters in video clips on social media after it airs. For the large portion of Americans who already know how they\u2019ll vote, it\u2019s unlikely a debate performance will change their minds, but Schroeder argued there are people who haven\u2019t expressed a preference. \u201cThey\u2019re still up for grabs,\u201d he said. \u201cThis debate and the one (hosted by ABC News) in September are likely to be events that would attract the people who don\u2019t normally pay a lot of attention to politics.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/politics/presidential-debate-history-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Bannon \u201cresponded to the subpoena with total noncompliance,\u201d Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar told the court. \u201cHe did not produce any documents and refused to appear for his scheduled deposition.\u201d \u201cHe cannot make the demanding showing necessary to override the normal requirement that a convicted defendant begin serving his sentence,\u201d Prelogar wrote. Bannon was convicted by a federal jury two years ago in Washington, DC, for not complying with\u00a0a\u00a0subpoena\u00a0for an\u00a0interview and documents in the US House\u2019s January 6, 2021, investigation. He has remained a staunch Trump ally and is a vocal supporter of his presidential reelection bid. He argued that he was not thumbing his nose at the House committee but rather relying on advice from his attorneys to not respond to the subpoena until lawmakers worked out Trump\u2019s claims of executive privilege. Bannon is set to report to the low-security federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut, instead of a minimum-security prison camp he had sought.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/politics/steve-bannon-supreme-court-prosecutors/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The deployment was part of a \u201clong-planned effort,\u201d one official said.

{"id": "2024_06_26_politics_congress-predictions-debate", "text": "Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle on Capitol Hill say that one looming question will be hanging over Thursday night\u2019s presidential debate \u2013 how both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump address concerns over their age and mental acuity. Democrats want the president\u2019s performance to dispel the GOP-propelled narrative that the 81-year-old president lacks the fitness to hold the nation\u2019s highest office, and by extension prove that Trump, who was found guilty in one criminal trial and faces three more, is the one who is unfit to serve. Republicans, meanwhile, are engineering a double-edged expectations game that seemingly raises the stakes on Biden, while lowering them for Trump. Beyond that, Democrats say they want Biden to clarify what he can and cannot do to help the economy while Republicans implore Trump to stay on message and not resort to personal attacks. In conversations with over a dozen lawmakers, both sides acknowledged that a debate performance four months out from election day is unlikely to make or break either candidate, but each side said they had high expectations for the rematch that presents a unique opportunity for both men to outline what they accomplished in four years as president. The chair of the House GOP campaign arm, Rep. Richard Hudson, wants Trump to focus on his record and not go after Biden for his age, telling CNN he doesn\u2019t think that should be a political issue. \u201cI think the American people will get a clear choice between two visions for America,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a unique situation when you got two people who have already been president, so you\u2019re not talking about their hopes and dreams, you\u2019re talking about their records.\u201d Trump, who often claims that Biden is mentally unfit, made the baseless allegation\u00a0over the weekend that Biden could use medical supplements,\u00a0or even illegal substances such as cocaine,\u00a0to enhance his performance on the debate stage in Atlanta. While the Biden campaign called the move \u201cdesperate,\u201d it didn\u2019t take long for Trump\u2019s narrative to take hold among House Republicans. GOP Rep. Ronny Jackson, Trump\u2019s former White House physician,\u00a0called\u00a0on Biden to take a drug test before the debate,\u00a0and many Republicans echoed Trump\u2019s empty claims. But House Speaker Mike Johnson tried to tamp down Trump\u2019s rhetoric about Biden\u2019s preparedness. \u201cLook there is a lot of things that are said in jest. Of course, no one expects that Joe Biden will be on cocaine,\u201d Johnson told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins on \u201cThe Source.\u201d \u201cPeople are asking will he be on some sort of energy drinks or something?\u201d Republicans also sought to undermine Biden\u2019s many days of preparation ahead of the debate with his team of advisers at Camp David, as a way to muddy the waters. \u201cHe\u2019s doing a ton of prep work. I never heard anything like that, like eight days at Camp David,\u201d GOP Rep. Byron Donalds said of Biden. \u201cSo I anticipate he\u2019s going to come in ready to go.\u201d Democrats argue this new line of attack \u2014 where Biden is over-prepared instead of unfit \u2014is an attempt from Republicans to try and get ahead of the president if he presents himself similar to his State of the Union address where he exceeded expectations just weeks after\u00a0former Special counsel Robert Hur \u2014 who did not press charges in his investigation \u2014 painted\u00a0a picture of the president as a forgetful commander in chief who failed to properly protect highly sensitive classified information. \u201c\u2018Sleepy Joe\u2019 was not asleep at all during the State of the Union,\u201d Democratic Rep. Steny Hoyer, parroting a GOP refrain of Biden, told CNN. \u201cI think (Republicans) are afraid that Biden is going to be sharp, on point and impressive.\u201d At the same time, Republicans have lowered expectations of Trump, claiming his long history of antagonizing CNN sets him up to claim victory no matter what happens given false accusations that have taken hold in Republican circles. \u201cIt\u2019s a no lose\u201d situation, GOP Rep. Kelly Armstrong said, arguing that many Republicans view the network as \u201can uneven playing field.\u201d The jockeying ahead of the debate puts in context how lawmakers are in overdrive trying to claim the narrative on behalf of their respective candidate ahead of the face off. \u2018Put to rest these rumors\u2019: What Democrats think a Joe Biden performance can do Democrats want to see Biden continue to chip away at Republican claims undermining his ability to lead on Thursday, while acknowledging that no single performance could dismantle the GOP narrative definitively. \u201cI am hoping to see President Biden look strong and competent, which I believe he is,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Susan Wild of Pennsylvania told CNN. \u201cI want him to focus on all of the good things that we have gotten done under this presidency, especially in the last Congress, and to put to rest these rumors of him somehow being unfit.\u201d Wild, who was with Biden in Normandy, where a host of recent GOP allegations about the president\u2019s mental fitness originated, described Biden as \u201cperfect\u201d and said lawmakers who have personal experiences with him need to speak out to cut the noise: \u201cI really think that people need to hear those stories.\u201d For Democrats then, the Republican narrative that Biden is too old or unfit to serve stems from a place of weakness. \u201cThey\u2019re sowing doubt because they can\u2019t come for his\u00a0agenda and his platform because it\u2019s incredibly popular with the American people. And on top of that, a lot of good things have been done over the last few years\u201d Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost of Florida told CNN. Biden \u201ccould have been in the same high school as Donald Trump.\u201d On top of that, Democrats want Biden to stay above the fray and present a clear message. Part of that clarity Democrats are seeking stems from how Biden presents his economic message. Even though the unemployment rate is at a historically low level, inflation remains high. Democrats want to see Biden on Thursday explain what is working and what he deserves credit for, while outlining what can be done to bring prices down. \u201cWe\u2019re not quite where we need to be, but moving in the right direction,\u201d Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts told CNN. \u201cHe just needs to stick to the facts.\u201d Republicans want Trump to stay focused on policy not personal vendettas Republicans on Capitol Hill hope that Trump can maintain a calm demeanor and not use his spotlight to air out grievances over his conviction in New York for falsifying business records or his other ongoing criminal cases. \u201cI hope he talks about the country moving forward and not past, you know, regrets,\u201d House Foreign Affairs Chair Michael McCaul told CNN. \u201cI want him to be thinking, looking forward, not backwards.\u201d A winning Trump performance at the debate \u2013 according to moderates like GOP Rep. Nick LaLota of New York \u2013 would be \u201cvery policy oriented.\u201d \u201cFocus on the issues. Lay off the personalities,\u201d Rep. Lisa McClain of Michigan told CNN of what she wants to see from both candidates. Senate GOP Whip John Thune had a clear message to Trump: \u201cDon\u2019t take the bait.\u201d But Thune\u2019s House counterpart had a more divisive message. \u201cI think Trump will win it without a problem,\u201d House GOP Whip Tom Emmer told CNN.  \u201cBecause he\u2019s absolutely sharp, has energy, he has more energy than people that are 20 years younger than him and the current occupant of the Oval Office can barely function.\u201d CNN\u2019s Haley Talbot, Morgan Rimmer, Lauren Fox and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/politics/congress-predictions-debate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_politics_biden-trump-contrast-debate-analysis", "text": "The Almighty won\u2019t be standing on stage alongside Joe Biden on Thursday night. But Donald Trump will. Biden\u2019s team is seizing on the most critical presidential debate in years to spell out a contrast on character and policy that it believes will decide the 2024 election, if only voters will finally perceive it. It\u2019s the embodiment of one of Biden\u2019s own, rather defensive jokes \u2014 the idea that he doesn\u2019t need to be universally popular, just more acceptable than the other guy, who, happily for him, happens to be the most extreme ex-president of modern times. \u201cMy dad used to say, \u2018Joey, don\u2019t compare me to the Almighty. Compare me to the alternative,\u2019\u201d the president has said for years at rallies. The argument is a safety net for a president with the kind of low approval ratings that would normally condemn him to a single term and who has struggled to sell his achievements to voters. Biden\u2019s team is setting up Trump as an \u201cunhinged\u201d and criminal agent of vengeance unfit for a return to the presidency who will only look after himself, rich friends, and anti-abortion zealots. Biden is reflected in this conceit as a bulwark of stability and a guardian of the country\u2019s democratic values who is tirelessly striving to improve workers\u2019 lives. Biden\u2019s campaign laid the groundwork for the Atlanta showdown hosted by CNN in a weekend memo. \u201cThursday\u2019s debate will be one of the first moments in this presidential campaign where a larger slice of the American electorate will have the opportunity to witness the stark choice between Joe Biden, who is fighting for the American people and Donald Trump who is fighting for himself as a convicted felon with an unhinged campaign of regency and retribution,\u201d Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler wrote. Campaign co-chair Mitch Landrieu highlighted the contrast on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. \u201cThe American people have to think about the wisdom, the character, and the judgment of the person that they\u2019re going to appoint to lead America not only at home but also to the rest of the world.\u201d And CNN\u2019s Kayla Tausche reported Tuesday that several top Democrats outside the White House want Biden to stop trying to claim credit for his achievements \u2014 including roaring jobs growth and a strong legislative record \u2014 and to go after Trump directly. \u201cHe wants the credit, but it\u2019s not working,\u201d one top Democrat, who had shared concerns with the campaign, said. How the 2024 election is different It\u2019s not unusual for an incumbent to try to savage an opponent\u2019s character and credentials to bolster a tough reelection bid. In 2004, President George W. Bush\u2019s team slandered Democrat John Kerry\u2019s Vietnam War heroism to portray him as too weak to lead the war on terror. In 2012, President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign presented Republican nominee Mitt Romney as a rich and callous corporate shark with an empty soul who relished sacking workers. Both of those attacks worked. But this is not a conventional campaign and Trump is not a conventional candidate. Democrats have been frustrated that the ex-president\u2019s return to the political spotlight and his romp to the GOP nomination have not already cemented the comparison and rendered him politically unacceptable. And the idea that voters will finally connect the dots depends on the premise that most Americans, unlike political obsessives in the campaigns and media industries, don\u2019t think about politics and presidential elections most of the time. They just need a nudge to remind them of how things used to be, the thinking goes. If Trump rants and vents his 2020 election lies on Thursday, he will play into Biden\u2019s hands. But while the television audience will be vast, the idea that there will be a moment of national realization about Trump\u2019s perceived threat seems more suited to the age of Cronkite than the age of TikTok. Biden, whom many voters believe is too old to serve a second term that would end when he is 86, is also under pressure to create a vision for the future for a weary electorate tired of high prices. He must therefore project certainty, stamina and authority on his own behalf to make the comparison work. But there is a deeper issue about the president\u2019s approach. Can it really be true that, eight years after Trump won the White House and three years after his turbulent presidency ended in violence, voters don\u2019t fully understand who Trump is? His dominance of media coverage makes it seem like he never went away. And voters would have to be hugely disengaged to not know that he\u2019s a recently convicted felon, was impeached twice, refused to accept defeat in 2020, called a crowd to Washington, DC, and told followers to \u201cfight like hell\u201d before they beat up police officers and invaded the US Capitol. Trump has lost a massive civil fraud trial, been found liable for sexual assault in a defamation case and mused during the pandemic about using disinfectant to treat Covid-19 inside the body.\u00a0He spent weeks at his recent hush money trial in New York attacking judges, witnesses, the legal system and vowing to use the presidency as a vehicle of personal and political revenge if he wins a second term. But he\u2019s still locked in a neck-and-neck race with Biden and has been leading in many of the critical swing states that pave the way to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. Biden and his fellow Democrats might see Trump as unacceptable. But he\u2019s not to millions of voters. The tied race reflects a nation split in two, politically and culturally, and is a commentary on Biden\u2019s unpopularity. And it reflects one of the most unusual aspects of this election. There are two presidents, both with a one-term record, competing for the White House. Voters don\u2019t really need to question how Trump would behave as president \u2014 they\u2019ve already seen it, even if a second term for the 45th president already looks like it would be more extreme and volatile than the first. How Trump could seek to frustrate Biden\u2019s strategy Assuming the Biden campaign sticks to this contrast strategy, Trump could thwart it by putting on a show of temperance and arriving with a list of plans to impress voters worried about their personal finances. There were isolated occasions during Trump\u2019s presidency when he met expectations of decorum. Karl Rove, the architect of Bush\u2019s 2004 reelection victory, wrote in his Wall Street Journal column last week that \u201cMr. Trump can\u2019t come off as unhinged or enraged. The words \u2018rigged election\u2019 shouldn\u2019t pass his lips. He has to keep his cool and can\u2019t make it all about himself.\u201d That\u2019s shrewd advice but Trump almost never behaves that way. Some of the former president\u2019s supporters have been transmitting advice on TV. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, for instance, said on NBC over the weekend that the debate would be a \u201cgreat opportunity for President Trump to talk about \u2026 how his policies when he served as president of this country were good for every single family that lived here. They had more money in their pockets. The grocery prices were down. Gas prices were down.\u201d She added: \u201cI don\u2019t think that he has to get personal in this debate at all.\u201d The former president has taken part in multiple policy sessions with supporters despite his disdain for formal debate practice. But the script often gets tossed out when he goes live. The unusual circumstances of Thursday\u2019s debate could work in Trump\u2019s favor. Microphones will be muted to ensure both candidates can use their time without interruptions. That could avoid the mayhem of the first Trump v. Biden debate in 2020. The then-president\u2019s feverish demeanor was partly explained days later when he was rushed to hospital with a serious case of Covid-19. But Biden\u2019s admonition, \u201cShut up, man!\u201d gave voice to voters tired of four years of Trumpian cacophony. In another break from previous years, there will be no live audience for the debate inside a CNN studio in Atlanta. Often, Trump\u2019s most extreme rhetoric erupts when he works a crowd and doubles down on comments that get a strong reaction. Still, the encounter will mark the ex-president\u2019s reacquaintance with an opponent he blames for what he falsely claims is a campaign of persecution that threatens his fortune and his liberty. And Trump hasn\u2019t exactly been strategic ahead of the debate. His campaign has spent days trying to roll back his expectations of Biden as a doddering, elderly president who can\u2019t string two words together. Now, his team is insisting Biden will be \u201cjacked up\u201d on drugs. After months of suggesting Biden is too senile to serve, the Trump campaign\u2019s strategy now seems illogical as it paints a picture of a supreme debater who, by implication, would seem to be of presidential timber. Trump senior advisor Jason Miller, for instance, said on Tuesday, \u201cWe know that when it comes to the big events, when it comes to debates, when it comes to State of the Union, things of that nature, that they\u2019re going to have Joe Biden completely super soldiered up.\u201d Miller added: \u201cHe is going to be ready to go. He has a certain muscle memory that kicks in for having done this for 50 years.\u201d Democrats will be hoping that\u2019s true and that he can live up to the contrast with his rival staked out by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren during a two-day swing through battleground Wisconsin. Biden, she said, is \u201ca good and decent man who will protect freedom for women across this country and who is fighting to lower costs for working families.\u201d Warren added, \u201cLet Donald Trump be Donald Trump, the guy who panders to an extremist base and who has said to his rich as hell donors that if they\u2019ll just put more money into his campaign, he\u2019ll give them giant tax cuts and cut back regulations on climate.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/politics/biden-trump-contrast-debate-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_politics_fact-check-trump-george-washington-slaves", "text": "Former President Donald Trump delivered another litany of false claims during two speeches on Saturday. And he expressed an opinion on American history that is clearly contradicted by the facts. During a speech to the Faith\u00a0and\u00a0Freedom\u00a0Coalition, a conservative Christian group,\u00a0Trump criticized proposals to change the names of schools, military facilities and other places that honor slaveowners and Confederate leaders. (Under President Joe Biden, the Army has renamed nine installations\u00a0that had been named for Confederate generals.) And Trump said, \u201cHow about George Washington high school? \u2018We want the name removed from that high school.\u2019 They don\u2019t know why. You know, they thought he had slaves. Actually I think he probably didn\u2019t.\u2019\u201d Facts First: Washington owned slaves. This is an extensively documented fact. At the time of Washington\u2019s death in 1799, there were 317 enslaved people at Mount Vernon, his home and plantation in Virginia, including 123 people owned by Washington himself.\u00a0 \u201cGeorge Washington owned slaves. We know this by his own hand. He kept ledgers on everyone he enslaved,\u201d said Alexis Coe, a senior fellow at the think tank New America and author of \u201cYou Never Forget Your First: A Biography of George Washington.\u201d Coe said it is \u201creprehensible, on a personal level, to deny such a thing\u201d and also \u201cdangerous to our country\u201d to have a leading presidential candidate espousing such inaccurate views on US history. The website for Mount Vernon, which is now maintained as a historic place, says\u00a0that the number of slaves at the property \u201cgrew steadily\u201d over Washington\u2019s time there from 1754 to 1799. Washington inherited 10 slaves from his father at age 11. The Mount Vernon website notes that \u201cas a young man, Washington purchased dozens of enslaved people from estate sales and in private transactions\u201d \u2013 and that the first US president also rented slaves from others, inherited them from siblings, and enslaved the children who were born to slaves at Mount Vernon. When he married his wife Martha, the website notes, he also gained control of \u201ca large number\u201d of enslaved people from the estate of her first husband. The\u00a0list\u00a0of\u00a0317 enslaved people at Mount Vernon at the time of his death included 41 people rented from other plantations and 153 people from Martha\u2019s first husband\u2019s estate. Washington privately struggled\u00a0with the idea of slavery and, in the last two decades of his life, expressed private support for the idea of abolishing slavery by legislation. But when he died, he immediately freed just one person in his will, his longtime manservant, and decreed that the other slaves he owned would be freed upon the death of his wife Martha. She ended up signing a deed to free all of his remaining slaves the year after his death, but she kept the slaves she had inherited herself. Trump made many other false claims Here are just some of the other false claims Trump made in the speech to the Christian conservative group or in his rally speech Saturday night\u00a0in Philadelphia: - Trump claimed Democrats rigged the 2020 presidential election, his usual debunked lie. - Trump claimed \u201cevery legal scholar\u201d wanted Roe v. Wade overturned and the power to set abortion policy returned to individual states, which is not true. - Trump claimed \u201cjust about all the Democrats\u201d also wanted Roe overturned and abortion policy set by states, though Democrats overwhelmingly supported the preservation of Roe. - Trump claimed \u201cthere are states that allow\u201d the execution of babies after birth, though that is illegal in every state.  - Trump claimed that the US has record inflation, though the current inflation rate, 3.3% in May, is nowhere near the US record (23.7% in 1920) or even the 40-year high (9.1%) that was hit in June 2022. - Trump claimed the price of bacon has increased 100% or more under Biden, though the Biden-era increase is actually about 17% as of May. - Trump claimed Biden was the person who indicted him in the New York criminal case in which he was convicted on 34 felony counts, though a grand jury of ordinary citizens indicted him and the prosecution was led by a local district attorney who does not report to the federal government. - Trump claimed the global prison population is \u201cway down\u201d under Biden because foreign leaders are emptying their detention facilities to send people to the US as migrants. But the global prison population is actually up since 2021, and there is no proof of Trump\u2019s repeated claim about foreign leaders\u2019 actions. - Trump claimed crime in Venezuela is down 72%, though the limited available numbers show a much smaller decline of about 26%. - Trump claimed crime in the US is \u201cso much up,\u201d though preliminary statistics show US crime dropped significantly in 2023 and again in the first quarter of 2024. - Trump claimed he has been indicted more than notorious gangster Al Capone, though Capone was actually indicted more than Trump. - Trump claimed China paid the entire cost of his tariffs on imported Chinese goods and that \u201cthe American people didn\u2019t pay for it at all,\u201d though study\u00a0after\u00a0study has found that Americans paid the overwhelming majority of the cost of the tariffs. - Trump claimed the Biden administration is trying to require Army tanks to be all-electric, though the military\u2019s move toward electric vehicles does not include tanks. - Trump told a story in which he claimed someone told him that non-electric trucks do not have to stop when driving from New York to Los Angeles, though they do.\u00a0", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/politics/fact-check-trump-george-washington-slaves/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_gender-gap-2024-election-analysis", "text": "Democrats are facing the threat of a gender gap that could imperil the traditional advantage among younger voters that the party has enjoyed for decades and that President Joe Biden likely needs to defeat former President Donald Trump. While Democrats are counting on a big backlash among younger women against the rollback of abortion rights to help propel Biden, a backlash among younger men against changing gender roles could help lift Trump. Both younger men and women are broadly discontented with the economy and Biden\u2019s job performance, polls show. But the anger and frustration over the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning the federal right to abortion provides Biden a powerful tool to expand his support among young women unhappy with him on other fronts, strategists in both parties agree. For many younger women, pollsters say, the loss of abortion rights has become not only a threat in itself, but a symbol of a broader attempt to reverse women\u2019s gains in economic status and pressure them back into more traditional gender roles. Meanwhile, Biden faces a dual challenge with younger men: Not only is abortion less of a motivating issue for them, but there\u2019s evidence that many of them are receptive to the messaging of Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement, with its implicit promise to restore traditional racial and gender hierarchies. In a striking new Pew Research Center national survey, for instance, fully two-fifths of the men younger than 50 who are supporting Trump agreed that women\u2019s gains in society have come at the expense of men. That was not only more than double the share of younger Biden-supporting men who agreed with that sentiment, but considerably larger even than the share of older Trump-supporting men who agreed. All this suggests that while cultural attitudes may help Biden overcome economic discontent among younger women, an amorphous but insistent sense of cultural marginalization may reinforce Trump\u2019s economic inroads among younger men. Researchers say democracies across the Western world are experiencing a widening partisan and ideological gap between younger men and women. In a much discussed article earlier this year, Financial Times columnist John Burn-Murdoch pointed to survey data in a variety of countries showing that young men were far more likely to identify as conservative than young women. \u201cIn countries on every continent, an ideological gap has opened up between young men and women,\u201d he wrote. That gap has widened in the US, too, though the evidence shows that it is growing more because young women are ideologically moving to the left than because young men are moving to the right. Merged annual results from NBC polls conducted by a bipartisan team of Democratic and Republican pollsters document the trends. In 2013, the share of young men aged 18-29 who called themselves conservative very slightly exceeded the share who identified as liberal, while the reverse was true for young women, according to results provided by Public Opinion Strategies, the GOP half of the partnership that conducts the NBC poll. For each gender, though, the balance between conservatives and liberals was nearly even. In their 2023 results, the pollsters found that young men had shifted slightly left, with slightly more now identifying as liberal than conservative. But, over that same 10-year period, young women had sped leftward: In the 2023 results, three times as many of them identified as liberal than as conservative. In 2013, the share of self-identified liberals among young women exceeded the share among young men by 5 percentage points; by 2023, that gap was nearly four times as large. These shifts over time have produced a situation where younger men are still more liberal than older men on most issues, but not nearly as liberal as younger women. The annual youth poll conducted by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University\u2019s John F. Kennedy school offers perhaps the best snapshot on the gender divergence among younger adults. In this year\u2019s survey, young men were 15 points more likely than young women to support building Trump\u2019s border wall, 12 points more likely to say same-sex relationships are morally wrong and 11 points more likely to say Israel\u2019s response to Hamas in Gaza has been justified. Still, in each case, only a minority of younger men endorsed those conservative viewpoints. But while younger men have moved only modestly to the right on most public policy issues, they have more clearly shifted in their willingness to identify with the Republican Party. The latest annual Harvard youth survey found that among young men, Democrats now only have a 3-percentage point advantage in party identification, down from 22 points as recently as 2020. Among women, the Democratic identification edge over that same period grew from 20 to 26 percentage points. (The NBC surveys likewise found the Democratic advantage narrowing among younger men and widening among younger women over recent years, though the changes were not as dramatic as in the Harvard poll.) \u201cThere is not a ton of evidence that young men are more likely to identify as conservatives, but there does seem to be a growing affinity for Republican identity,\u201d said Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American\u00a0Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. That growing receptivity to the GOP could contribute to a wider gender gap among young people than in recent elections. The latest Harvard poll showed that among likely younger voters, Biden led Trump by about 2-to-1 among women, almost exactly his advantage in the Harvard Poll at this point in 2020. But among likely male voters, the survey found that Biden led Trump by just 6 points, a precipitous, and perilous, decline from his 26-point advantage in the 2020 survey at this point. Other respected sources on voting results in 2020, such as the exit polls, found that Biden didn\u2019t win young men that year by as much as Harvard projected, which would mean his decline now is less severe. Still, pollsters in both parties say their own data track the same movement the Harvard poll identifies, with Biden largely holding his lead from 2020 among younger women, but slipping among younger men, including not only White but Black and Latino younger men. The good news for Biden is that younger women turned out at much higher rates than younger men in 2020; in fact, the gap between female and male turnout that year was wider for younger adults than in any other age group, according to analysis of Census Bureau data by William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Metro thinktank. But Biden has so little margin for error in the battleground states that the level of erosion among younger men that he\u2019s experiencing in polls still poses a grave threat to his reelection. In explaining the growing youth gender gap, analysts point to several factors. One is diverging priorities between young men and women. Even more young women in the Harvard youth poll expressed negative views about Biden\u2019s economic record than young men did, but the women were far more likely than the men to cite abortion as a key factor in their vote. \u201cThe difference is young women are voting more on culture and rights, such as abortion, and young men are probably going to be more compelled to vote on economic reasons,\u201d said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute and author of the forthcoming book, \u201cThe Politics of Gen Z: How the Youngest Voters Will Shape our Democracy.\u201d As with all generations, Trump\u2019s belligerent style also contributes to the widening gender divide. \u201cYounger men admire the strength of Trump, but what younger men think is strong, women think is chaotic, crazy and divisive,\u201d said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, who polled for Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign. Trump also has a significant tactical advantage in that he tends to be portrayed much more positively than Biden on the YouTube channels, podcasts, Reddit threads and TikTok videos that constitute the principal source of information for many young men, noted John Della Volpe, who directs the Harvard youth poll. (In that survey, young men were substantially more likely than young women to say they rely on YouTube as a major source of news.) \u201cThe media ecosystem specifically among young men is [a place] where Joe Biden doesn\u2019t get a break and Trump is stood up as an anti-hero,\u201d said Della Volpe, who is advising a newly formed super PAC trying to boost Biden among young people. Trump has leaned into that advantage by identifying with entertainment that disproportionately draws younger men, like the Ultimate Fighting Championship match he attended as his first public event following his felony conviction in New York. Trump may also be drawing from deeper wells of changing social attitudes. Last week\u2019s Pew finding that two-fifths of younger males backing Trump believe women\u2019s gains have come at men\u2019s expense is only one of many recent poll results suggesting more young men are bristling against the rising demands for gender and racial equity. The new Pew poll, for instance, also found that more than four-fifths of the younger men supporting Trump asserted that all the obstacles blocking women\u2019s advancement in society have been eliminated \u2014 more than double the share of Biden-supporting younger men who agreed. (In this case, older men backing Trump were as likely to endorse that statement as younger ones.) Nearly two-thirds of the younger men supporting Trump also agreed in the poll that \u201csociety is better off if people make marriage and having children a priority\u201d \u2014 equal to the share of older Trump men and more than triple the share of younger Biden men. In an AEI poll this spring, the share of all young men who say efforts to promote gender equity have gone too far reached about 1-in-5, more than double the level in 2017. Survey evidence also shows resistance, particularly among younger White men, to the growing demands from minority groups for more racial equity in education, employment and other settings. In that same AEI poll, over three-fifths of young White women said their race has made their life easier, but far fewer young White men said the same (only about 2-in-5). Conversely, in this year\u2019s Harvard poll, nearly three-fifths of men (of all races) agreed that society is placing too much emphasis on racial identity; only about two-fifths of young women agreed. Exactly three-fourths of younger men supporting Trump in the Pew poll rejected the idea that Whites benefit from advantages in society unavailable to Blacks. This backlash against a changing society only extends so far: Though the \u201ctradwife\u201d movement in social media celebrates women reverting to roles as homemakers and mothers, in the Harvard Poll only about 1-in-6 younger men (and 1-in-10 younger women) agreed that women should prioritize having children over entering the workforce. Deckman noted that compared to older generations, young men today\u00a0\u201chave been raised by their mothers and aunts and grandmothers, who have gone on to hold jobs and be professionals and they are used to seeing women as leaders.\u201d But if young men aren\u2019t moving back to 1950s expectations in large numbers, the surveys showing male unease with women\u2019s increasing independence and authority make clear that something is stirring. \u201cLooking across different surveys and different questions, we can debate about the degree to which it is changing, but there is no doubt we are seeing movement,\u201d said Cox of the AEI. This pushback among young men comes after activism around racial and gender equality in the past few years reached its highest level since the late 1960s and early 1970s, with the rise of the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements and more forceful advocacy in LGBTQ communities. (In the Harvard poll, one-fourth of young women identified in some way as LGBTQ, more than double the share of young men.) It also comes amid continuing evidence that women are navigating the transition to an information-based economy better than men: Women now account for about 60% of all four-year college graduates and nearly 65% of graduate degrees, according to the latest federal statistics. In her upcoming book, Deckman sees the #MeToo movement as the galvanizing force initially propelling more Gen Z women toward liberal activism. That first impulse, she said, has been reinforced by Trump\u2019s 2016 electoral success, despite his extensive history of misogynistic statements and behavior. The sharp turn right on social issues in red states, punctuated by the Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 Dobbs decision overturning the nationwide right to abortion, has provided another spur to activism. Anna Dean, co-founder and co-CEO of the group LOUDwomen, is one of the young female activists Deckman profiles in her book. Dean, now a rising senior at Harvard, helped to start the group in high school in Bentonville, Arkansas, when she noticed that young women and racial minorities were dropping out of school debate activity after biased treatment by the judges. When Trump was elected, she said, the young women felt the same sexist or racist behavior they were fighting in their schools was \u201creflected on the news when we hear Donald Trump speak.\u201d The Dobbs decision, she said, underlined the sense among the young women that their rights were eroding, even as many of them had reached educational milestones unmatched for older women in their families. When relatives or acquaintances tell Dean she is living the \u201cwildest dreams\u201d of earlier generations of women by attending Harvard, she said she often thinks: \u201cOK, yeah this is awesome but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same rights you did when you were my age. I am doing things my ancestors could have only dreamed of, but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same health care rights.\u201d Della Volpe says that from his research and focus groups, he believes that younger men are not so much hostile to the movements demanding more rights for women or LGBTQ people as wondering where that leaves them. \u201cI have empathy for them because in large measure they are just trying to figure life out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they sense and feel, sometimes accurately, sometimes inaccurately, that while they are trying to figure life out that they are being judged by people \u2014 that they are projected to be inferior or bad or ignorant, or worse, racist or homophobic. I think that\u2019s a big part of this.\u201d Such anxieties and grievances about social change have always provided the waters that Trump fishes in. The ability to identify the currents of discontent about change \u2014 cultural, racial or economic \u2014 in each group that he is targeting may be Trump\u2019s greatest skill as a politician. Just as the former president has powerfully appealed to White voters who feel marginalized in a more racially diverse America, or to blue-collar factory towns that feel left behind by the transition to a metro-based information economy, he\u2019s also showing a magnetic pull for the men who feel eclipsed by women\u2019s growing prominence in the workplace and society. Most younger men don\u2019t necessarily hold favorable views about Trump personally, noted Cox, but many are receptive to his broad message that elites in modern US society are discriminating against him and his followers. \u201cThat grievance is what binds them [to him] when very little else does,\u201d Cox said. By contrast, said Deckman, for younger women who believe opportunity and power in US society are still too much tilted toward men, \u201cDonald Trump is the embodiment of many of the things they are opposed to. \u2026 They are sick of old White guys running everything.\u201d That sentiment doesn\u2019t easily translate into enthusiasm for Biden, the other \u201cold White guy\u201d\u00a0in the race. Dean said that despite the distaste for Trump, even young women in her activist circles are more likely to talk about their frustrations with the current president than their fears of the prior one. Given the risk that Biden won\u2019t match his 2020 performance with young men, he has an urgent need to rekindle that flagging enthusiasm among young women. \u201cHe\u2019s got to make up for the defection of young men by winning young women by more, and he\u2019s got to get every young woman he can out to vote,\u201d said Lake, the Democratic pollster. Biden\u2019s best hope of avoiding a catastrophic decline in his youth support is that the number of young women Trump repels exceeds the number of young men he attracts.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/gender-gap-2024-election-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_politics_purdue-pharma-supreme-court-opioid-settlement", "text": "The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a controversial settlement that would have sent billions of dollars to treatment programs and victims of the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic but also shielded the Sackler family from future lawsuits despite the fact that it made its fortune selling prescription opioids. Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote the opinion for a 5-4 majority. \u201cThe Sacklers seek greater relief than a bankruptcy discharge normally affords, for they hope to extinguish even claims for wrongful death and fraud, and they seek to do so without putting anything close to all their assets on the table,\u201d Gorsuch wrote. \u201cDescribe the relief the Sacklers seek how you will, nothing in the bankruptcy code contemplates (much less authorizes) it.\u201d Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a fellow conservative, said in dissent that the court\u2019s decision will have a \u201cdevastating\u201d impact on thousands of victims of the opioid epidemic. \u201cAs a result, opioid victims are now deprived of the substantial monetary recovery that they long fought for and finally secured after years of litigation,\u201d he wrote in the dissent, which was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Kavanaugh went on to implore Congress to amend US bankruptcy law to \u201cfix the chaos that will now ensue\u201d from the court\u2019s ruling. \u201cThe court\u2019s decision will lead to too much harm for too many people for Congress to sit by idly without at least carefully studying the issue,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote. On a court that often focuses first and foremost on the text of the law, Gorsuch noted that the bankruptcy law didn\u2019t specifically give authority to courts to allow third parties like the Sacklers to avoid future liability. And while he acknowledged that the decision Thursday \u201cmay cause Purdue\u2019s current reorganization plan to unravel,\u201d Gorsuch wrote that outcome would considerably increase legal exposure for the Sacklers and may force the family to negotiate better terms. \u201cIf past is prologue,\u201d Gorsuch wrote, citing an argument from the Justice Department, \u201cthere may be a better deal on the horizon.\u201d The case dealt with the fate of a company and its leaders who produced and promoted a highly addictive drug, OxyContin, in the early days of an opioid crisis that has claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans and shattered many more. As the nation continues to grapple with the opioid epidemic, the Sackler family had agreed to pay $6 billion to families and states as part of an agreement to wind down Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin. In exchange, the Sackler family would be immunized from future civil liability claims. Purdue marketed OxyContin as a safer and less addictive painkiller, encouraging doctors to prescribe the drug over longer periods of time and for more routine injuries. The drug\u2019s success fueled the Sackler fortune, and the family became known for philanthropy. But a series of lawsuits and news accounts alleged the family continued to promote OxyContin even after it learned of the drug\u2019s addictive properties. Not only did many Americans become addicted, but some turned to heroin and other opioids when they could no longer fill their prescriptions. From 1999 to 2021, nearly 645,000 people died from an opioid overdose, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cBoth sides of this policy debate may have their points,\u201d Gorsuch wrote. \u201cBut, in the end, we are the wrong audience for them.\u201d Congress, he said, should resolve the issue of whether third parties can be shielded from future lawsuits. \u201cOur only proper task is to interpret and apply the law as we find it,\u201d Gorsuch added, \u201cand nothing in present law authorizes the Sackler discharge.\u201d Purdue Pharma: \u2018Ruling is heart-crushing\u2019 In a statement, Purdue said the ruling will require the company to renew efforts to \u201creach back out to the same creditors who have already proven they can unite to forge a settlement in the public interest, and renew our pursuit of a resolution that delivers billions of dollars of value for opioid abatement and allows the Company to emerge from bankruptcy as a public benefit company.\u201d \u201cToday\u2019s ruling is heart-crushing because it invalidates a settlement supported by nearly all of our creditors \u2013 including states, local governments, personal injury victims, schools, and hospitals \u2013 that would have delivered billions of dollars for victim compensation, opioid crisis abatement, and overdose rescue and addiction treatment medicines,\u201d Purdue said. \u201cCritically, the ruling is limited to the narrow legal issue regarding the scope of the third-party releases conferred by the plan.\u00a0The decision does nothing to deter us from the twin goals of using settlement dollars for opioid abatement and turning the company into an engine for good.\u201d In a separate statement, the families of the late Mortimer Sackler and the late Raymond Sackler also said they were disappointed by the decision. \u201cThe Sackler families remain hopeful about reaching a resolution that provides substantial resources to help combat a complex public health crisis,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThe unfortunate reality is that the alternative is costly and chaotic legal proceedings in courtrooms across the country. While we are confident that we would prevail in any future litigation given the profound misrepresentations about our families and the opioid crisis, we continue to believe that a swift negotiated agreement to provide billions of dollars for people and communities in need is the best way forward.\u201d Those supporting the bankruptcy argued the yearslong process had gone on long enough and was unlikely to yield additional money from the Sackler family. The vast majority of known current opioid victims and their families supported the agreement. But the Justice Department said it was a raw deal for victims \u2013 particularly potential future victims. While such third-party \u201crelease\u201d arrangements are not uncommon in bankruptcies, the department argued that nothing in the law explicitly authorizes a court to bar future lawsuits forever. A federal appeals court in New York approved the deal last year but the Supreme Court paused the arrangement in August so it could review the case. The bankruptcy plan was opposed by the US Trustee, a part of the Justice Department that serves as a watchdog over bankruptcy cases. Calling it an \u201cabuse,\u201d the office said that barring individual victims from pursuing their own lawsuits against the Sackler family \u201craises serious constitutional questions.\u201d Under the agreement, Purdue Pharma would cease to exist and a new company, Knoa Pharma, would be created in its place. Knoa would distribute opioid addiction treatments and overdose reversal medicines, while continuing to produce opioids. CNN\u2019s Samantha Delouya contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_06_26_politics_us-arms-shipments-israel", "text": "American officials went through a line-by-line explanation of hundreds of US weapons shipments to Israel in meetings this week with the country\u2019s defense minister in a bid to rebut claims from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the Biden administration was delaying military assistance. The meetings with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant came amid a growing spat between the Biden administration and Netanyahu, who has claimed that armaments are being delayed to the intense frustration of Washington. It was the latest spat between the two allies, which have diverged over Israel\u2019s war tactics in Gaza. US officials meeting Gallant this week brought in experts from across the government to engage in \u201cprofessional to professional\u201d discussions that ticked through in exacting detail the current state of munitions shipments. \u201cWe had a very good opportunity to sit down with experts from across our system and go through every single case,\u201d a senior US administration official said. \u201cThis is one of the most complex security partnerships we have, one of the most multifaceted.\u201d CNN reviewed publicly available flight tracking data which shows that a steady stream of US military and Israeli\u00a0cargo flights\u00a0have arrived in Israel since the outbreak of the\u00a0Israel-Hamas\u00a0war in October. A\u00a0US official confirmed the flights identified by\u00a0CNN were carrying military aid to Israel from US stockpiles. \u201cThese flights represent the steady flow of DoD assistance and highlight that Israel also employs contracted air to ship security assistance as well,\u201d the official said. By reviewing flight tracking data from ADS-B Exchange and Flight Radar 24, CNN was able to identify at least 68 different flights between US Air Force\u00a0bases\u00a0and Israel, a number which includes both US military flights and Israeli contracted cargo jets. October and January had the largest number of flights, with 15 and 14, respectively. But every other month has averaged roughly five flights of\u00a0military shipments\u00a0to Israel, according to the data. The data shows that military shipments by air have continued at a steady pace since the initial wave of supplies in the early months of the war, rebutting\u00a0claims from the Israeli government of a dramatic slowdown in US military supplies to Israel. The list compiled by CNN is not comprehensive; it includes only flights that appeared on flight tracking websites \u2013 planes that had their transponders turned on.\u00a0Military flights, unlike passenger or cargo flights, are more difficult to track because their transponders are frequently turned off. The US has paused one shipment of weapons to Israel, which includes 500-pound and 2000-pound bombs over concerns to the potential for civilian casualties if such weapons were used in densely populated areas in Gaza. \u201cWe paused that one shipment,\u201d Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said at a press briefing on Monday. \u201cEverything else continues to flow on schedule as normal. It is not diminished.\u201d According to a\u00a0source\u00a0briefed on the transfer of weapons to Israel, the US\u00a0continued transferring hundreds of munitions each month over the course of the spring and through recent weeks. The exact numbers of transfers and information about specific weapons in each shipment is classified, but hundreds of GBU-39 Small Diameter Bombs, artillery ammunition, tank ammunition\u00a0and other items have continued flowing, the\u00a0source said. The senior administration official attributed Netanyahu\u2019s claims \u2013 made multiple times over the course of the last week, including in a video in English released on social media \u2013 to \u201cmisunderstandings\u201d on the Israelis\u2019 part. \u201cThere\u2019s stuff happening literally every day across the US government and across the Israeli system, and we were able to go through everything,\u201d the official said, adding the US was able to clarify the status of certain shipments as they make their way through a complex delivery process. There was \u201creal progress\u201d in developing an understanding of that process and of prioritizing certain cases, the official said, adding there was an agreement to identify any \u201cinefficiencies\u201d going forward. \u201cThis is a massive, massive undertaking, and nothing has paused other than that one shipment,\u201d the administration official said, referring to heavy payload bombs that Biden paused last month. There are continued discussions on how to resolve that pause. Instead, the official acknowledged there was a \u201ccomplicated, bureaucratic\u201d system that meant some shipments took a long time to be fulfilled. A State Department\u00a0official\u00a0stressed that, with the exception of the hold on heavy bombs, \u201ceverything else is moving in due course.\u201d They \u201ccontinue to have constructive discussions with the Israelis\u201d for the release of the heavy bombs, the official said, but they did not have a further update on when that hold might be lifted. The official said that the US has \u201csurged billions of dollars in security assistance to Israel since the October 7 attacks\u201d and pointed to the administration\u2019s passage of \u201cthe largest ever supplemental appropriation for emergency assistance to Israel.\u201d They said they are \u201ccommitted to ensuring Israel gets every dollar appropriated in the supplemental,\u201d noting the recent approval of an $827 million foreign military financing tranche of weapons and equipment. Netanyahu publicly claimed the Biden administration was \u201cwithholding weapons\u201d in a video posted to X last week, claiming that Secretary of State Antony Blinken \u201cassured me that the administration is working day and night to remove these bottlenecks.\u201d While Biden did halt deliveries of the heavy bombs as Israel was preparing for an operation in the southern city of Rafah, other shipments of armaments continued. Since\u00a0Netanyahu\u00a0first took his complaints public last week, White House officials have brushed off some of\u00a0his\u00a0comments as motivated by politics as he works to maintain a fragile grip on power. But they nonetheless caused deep frustration inside the White House. Officials said they had no idea what he was talking about, and described the remarks as \u201cperplexing,\u201d \u201cvexing\u201d and \u201cincorrect.\u201d Netanyahu responded, saying he was \u201cwilling to absorb personal attacks if that is what it takes for Israel to get the arms and ammunition it needs in its war for survival.\u201d By the weekend, the White House said it wasn\u2019t interested in getting into a back-and-forth with the prime minister. \u201cWe have made our position clear on this repeatedly and we are not going to keep responding to the prime minister\u2019s political statements. We look forward to constructive consultations with the\u00a0defense\u00a0minister in Washington this week,\u201d a White House official said. This story has been updated with additional reporting.

{"id": "2024_06_22_politics_democrats-elections-what-matters", "text": "With Democrats divided over the Israel-Hamas war, uninspired by their presidential nominee in Joe Biden and planning a convention in Chicago, there have been multiple comparisons to 1968, when Democrat Hubert Humphrey lost the White House to Republican Richard Nixon. The Vietnam War divided Democrats that year. Humphrey was uninspiring to younger voters opposed to the war. There was violence outside their convention in Chicago. Democrats today should hope that a better comparison is to 1948, when then-President Harry Truman, an unpopular incumbent, pulled off a surprise reelection versus Thomas Dewey, then the Republican governor of New York. That year, 1948, was also a much better year for Humphrey, then the young and inspiring Minneapolis mayor who helped push Democrats on the road to embracing civil rights legislation that would ultimately remake both political parties over the coming decades. I talked to Samuel Freedman, a Columbia Journalism School professor, about his recent book about Humphrey and the 1948 Democratic convention in Philadelphia. The book\u2019s title, \u201cInto the Bright Sunshine,\u201d is taken from a line in Humphrey\u2019s rousing speech on civil rights. The crackling audio does not hide the competing jeers and applause when Humphrey says: My friends, to those who say that we are rushing this issue of civil rights, I say to them we are 172 years late. To those who say that this civil-rights program is an infringement on states\u2019 rights, I say this: The time has arrived in America for the Democratic Party to get out of the shadow of states\u2019 rights and to walk forthrightly into the bright sunshine of human rights. It is a particularly important time to remember right now, when there is an effort on the American political right to reinterpret the history of the Civil Rights Movement. Here\u2019s my conversation with Freedman, conducted by phone and edited for length and clarity: Lessons for 2024 Biden from 1948 Truman WOLF: The fulcrum of the book is this 1948 Democratic convention and Humphrey\u2019s civil rights speech there. Until 2016, 1948 was probably the biggest presidential election upset in US history. What could 2024 Joe Biden, who trails Donald Trump in much of the polling, learn from 1948 Harry Truman, who trailed Thomas Dewey right to the end? FREEDMAN: They are very comparable experiences, even with the fact that Truman had not one third party, but two third parties also to worry about \u2013 Henry Wallace to his left and Strom Thurmond to his right. We don\u2019t know about the effect in the tight election of RFK Jr., and even for that matter, of (the Green Party\u2019s) Jill Stein. So Biden has a complicated course to run. Truman went back and forth on civil rights \u2013 he was very bold, amazingly so in 1946 and \u201947, then he backed away out of fear it would cost him the election in \u201848. Really what Humphrey\u2019s triumph with the civil rights plank at the \u201848 convention did is it forced Truman to run as a civil rights candidate, which ended up being the reason he won the race. He really starts it in July, Truman, by desegregating the military and the federal workforce, and he culminates it the last weekend before Election Day, having a rally and giving a campaign speech in Harlem, which no major party presidential candidate had ever done. So I think part of the lesson of what Truman did, for Biden, is to try to be bold, to be assertive, to take some of the risks that need to be taken. Humphrey went from heroic to ridiculed WOLF: Today, we look at Hubert Humphrey as an also-ran of American politics. What were you trying to accomplish writing a book that leads up to this single speech at the \u201948 convention? FREEDMAN: I wanted to fill two gaps. I wanted to, first of all, fill a biographical gap about Humphrey, because if people know him at all today, it\u2019s from a largely disparaged and ridiculed latter part of his career supporting the Vietnam War as Lyndon Johnson\u2019s vice president, getting the presidential nomination in 1968 amid the police riot in Chicago, and then really fecklessly, almost pathetically, running as the establishment candidate against George McGovern for the Democratic nomination in 1972. And yet, there was this amazing chapter in his earlier life when he had been out there in a way few White Americans of the time were, really putting his entire career at risk to fight the fight for civil rights. People who felt betrayed by Humphrey in the \u201960s because he was no longer being a liberal hero forgot why they thought he was a liberal hero in the first place. And what he did in the 1948 convention is the epitome of it, to get the Democratic Party to endorse the civil rights agenda for the first time ever, and to accomplish something that FDR hadn\u2019t been willing to do, which was to defy and ultimately oust the Southern segregationist wing of the party. The other gap I wanted to fill was a historical gap, because a lot of the great writing that\u2019s been done about the Civil Rights Movement tends to position its origins in the 1950s with the Montgomery bus boycott and Brown v. Board of Ed decision, and so forth. And yet, there was all this activity in the \u201940s, very much catalyzed by Black GIs and the Double V movement (victory in the war and victory over oppression at home). You know, very much affected by the global war against fascism, and that activity really anticipates and makes possible everything that happens in the \u201950s and \u201860s, and yet has gotten much less attention, comparatively speaking. So those were the two gaps I was aiming to address. 2024 vs. 1968 WOLF: Humphrey is certainly more associated with that \u201968 convention. This year, there\u2019s obviously a fractured Democratic Party, as there was in 1968, and the convention is again in Chicago. What are the similarities you see between this year and \u201868? FREEDMAN:  There are a couple of takeaways from Humphrey\u2019s campaign in \u201968. One is you\u2019ve got to really hit the right tone. The speech that he made in April of 1968 to announce his campaign was so tone-deaf. It talked about the politics of happiness, the politics of joy, and it was completely out of tune with the tenor of the times. This is like three and a half weeks after Martin Luther King had been killed. It\u2019s just about as long as after Lyndon Johnson decided not to run. There was a massive anti-war movement. It just felt like Humphrey, who usually had such a keen sense of retail politics, totally misread the mood of the country. He struggled, really for the rest of the campaign, to come back to finding a way to stick to things he wanted to stick to about hope and unity and possibility, while trying to find the words, and I think never really quite succeeding, to acknowledge the hurt, the anxiety, the division within the country. It\u2019s also a lesson about the importance of optics, and this is even before the 24-hour news cycle. Humphrey is giving his speech at the \u201968 convention, where in the middle of his speech, the live TV coverage cuts away to show the Chicago police beating demonstrators and journalists on the streets of Chicago. It\u2019s the most catastrophic optic you could imagine. Another similarity is that although Joe Biden has run essentially unopposed in primaries, it\u2019s almost as if he didn\u2019t really have to face the Democratic voting public this year, the way he definitely did in 2020, and comes in as feeling more coordinated and less chosen. In 1968, the Democratic Party was operating under old rules in which primary voters actually had relatively little direct effect on delegates. Humphrey enters late, after Bobby Kennedy had been in, after Eugene McCarthy had been in, and won most of his delegates by going through the party apparatus. So it looked like he had this nomination kind of handed to him by the machine, over and against the passions of the voters, who had turned out in large numbers for Bobby Kennedy and Eugene McCarthy. That also presents a problem of how do you build up the requisite passion? At the end of the day, he did something in late September that almost saved his campaign, which was finally to break away from Lyndon Johnson on Vietnam and to stake out a much bolder peace plank on Vietnam. In fact, it was a peace plank that was defeated at the convention where Humphrey\u2019s forces opposed it. Had Humphrey done that sooner would he have won? Good question. The other important thing Humphrey said, that I think Biden really has to find a way to express, came from the speech accepting the nomination. I\u2019m going to read you this paragraph, because I think it\u2019s so prescient. He says: I say to those who\u2019ve differed with their neighbor or with those who\u2019ve differed with their fellow Democrat, may I say to you that all of your goals, all of your high hopes, all of your dreams, all them will come to naught if we lose this election, and many of them can be realized with the victory that can come to us. That is so exactly right, and it\u2019s something that Joe Biden has to communicate. Just like for people, particularly young liberals, who couldn\u2019t bring themselves to vote for Humphrey in \u201968, what they got was Nixon. What they got was, instead of peace talks and a bombing halt, and an internationally supervised ceasefire, which was Humphrey\u2019s stance by the end of the campaign, they got the war going on for seven more years, with tens of thousands more American deaths and hundreds of thousands, if not millions, more Vietnamese deaths. They got Watergate. They got the race-baiting that Nixon engaged in. They got the proto-Trump pseudo populism of Spiro Agnew as vice president. So there\u2019s a real price to pay there for hanging on to your purity of not being able to vote for Hubert Humphrey and forgive him even the egregious mistake on Vietnam because of everything else he brought to the table that was absolutely consistent with the liberal agenda. Correcting the counterfactual about Republicans and civil rights WOLF: As I was reading the climax of this book, there was an interview on CNN with Rep. Byron Donalds, the Republican from Florida, who was arguing this counterfactual \u2013 and you can find many other instances of it \u2013 that a lot of present-day Republicans are pushing that they deserve credit for the Civil Rights Movement, because Abraham Lincoln was a Republican, because there were Southern Democrats who opposed the Civil Rights Act. This comes up in your descriptions of the \u201948 convention, particularly with Strom Thurmond (the South Carolina Democrat turned Republican). I was hoping to get your historical analysis of that idea. FREEDMAN: It\u2019s preposterous for the Republicans to make that argument in 2024 or at any time in the last 60 years, to be honest. When Strom Thurmond and the Dixiecrats bolted from the Democratic Party in 1948, that\u2019s the beginning of the vast majority of the White South becoming Republicans, stepping away from the Democratic Party. Even though (Adlai) Stevenson in \u201952 and \u201856 and JFK in 1960 tried to lure them back in, it was still the beginning of a process by which \u2013 with Barry Goldwater in \u201964, who opposed civil rights legislation; Nixon\u2019s \u201cSouthern strategy\u201d in \u201868 and \u201872; (Ronald) Reagan\u2019s appeals to racial resentment in \u201880 and \u201884; the Willie Horton ad in \u201888; and then to Trump in all of his races \u2013 that all began in \u201848. Those people who walked out with Strom Thurmond and the voters who voted for them never really went back to the Democratic Party again. While the party labels have remained the same \u2013 there is still the Democratic Party and there is still the Republican Party \u2013 the people who are voting have totally exchanged places, because the parties exchanged places on the issue of civil rights. It\u2019s true that, going back to Lincoln, the Republicans were seen as the party of emancipation and the amendments that created, at least on paper, racial equality. On that basis, until 1948 really with Truman, and then in even larger numbers in 1964 with LBJ and consistently since then, the White Southern vote that used to go to the Democrats, because the Democrats were the party of Jim Crow, has become the solid White vote for the Republican Party. Show me a major Republican politician in the MAGA movement who is a fervent supporter of civil rights legislation. In any kind of iteration, you don\u2019t have (Republicans) now like Mitt Romney\u2019s father, (former Michigan Gov.) George Romney, or (former Pennsylvania Gov.) William Scranton, or Edward Brooke, a Black senator from Massachusetts \u2026 You don\u2019t even have people like Nixon, before he went bad on civil rights, who was a really active member of the NAACP. That doesn\u2019t exist in the Republican Party anymore, and it\u2019s just absurd to say that because 80 years ago to 100, 120 years ago, the Democrats were indeed the party of segregation, that that\u2019s somehow still the case.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/politics/democrats-elections-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_politics_presidential-debate-trump-biden", "text": "The confrontation in Atlanta between Joe Biden and Donald Trump Thursday night has a good chance of becoming the most fateful presidential debate in US history. For the first time, a sitting president and an ex-president will lock horns before millions of viewers, in an encounter taking place far earlier than normal \u2014 even before the party conventions. The CNN-hosted showdown is the most pivotal moment yet in a neck-and-neck election, and it\u2019s Biden\u2019s best chance to shake up a reelection bid that he is in deep danger of losing as he struggles to convince voters that he\u2019s delivered the political and economic normality he promised in 2020. The debate comes at a moment when many Americans are seeking relief from high prices that have made it harder to feed their families and afford rents, mortgages, and new cars. It is unfolding amid an intense national debate over access to abortion that was unleashed by the conservative Supreme Court majority built by Trump. Deep divides over immigration and foreign policy in a world filled with new challenges to US power will form a contentious backdrop to a clash between two candidates who openly disdain one another. The debate in that sense personifies an election race that has left millions of Americans unsatisfied with the choice offered by two elderly candidates who alienate more voters than they attract. But the momentous circumstances of the occasion can only be fully understood alongside the context of the unprecedented politics of the times. Since Sen. John F. Kennedy and Vice President Richard Nixon staged\u00a0the first televised debate\u00a0in the 1960 campaign, there have been agonizingly close elections that have set the country on a sharply different course. But the stakes in 2024 are greater than ever because of Trump\u2019s attempt to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power based on false claims of fraud in the 2020 election and his promise to wage a never-before-seen presidency of personal vengeance if he wins in November. Biden plans to frame what he sees as Trump\u2019s threat to the rule of law and democracy in the starkest terms, sources familiar with the matter told CNN\u2019s Kayla Tausche. He will describe the mob attack by Trump\u2019s supporters on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, as a \u201cseismic,\u201d era-defining moment that must be a watershed for voters. \u201cThe embodiment of the threat is returning,\u201d said one Biden source. That backdrop means this presidential debate has a different cast than all its predecessors. Had Sen. John Kerry beaten President George W. Bush in 2004 or ex-Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney made President Barack Obama a one-term president in 2012, there would have been significant political change. But the character of the republic and its global posture would not have fundamentally altered. That assurance cannot be applied with any confidence to the current election. Trump\u2019s strongman impulse \u2013 epitomized by his claim before the Supreme Court that presidents have almost limitless power, as well as a blueprint for hardline new policies on immigration, the economy and foreign policy \u2013 means a second term could bring massive disruption. \u201c(It is) unbelievably historic. You cannot (over) hype up the importance of this,\u201d presidential historian Douglas Brinkley told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday. Democrats are desperate for the 81-year-old Biden to put on a show of vitality and sharpness amid concerns about his age. Seventy-eight-year-old Trump\u2019s biggest liability might be himself and the possibility of a performance that could validate Biden\u2019s warnings that he\u2019s too \u201cunhinged\u201d to be president. Biden is expected to hammer Trump over abortion \u2014 one of the few policy areas where he outpolls the former president \u2014 and his admiration of foreign dictators. Trump is already signaling he\u2019ll portray Biden\u2019s America in dystopian terms, beset by uncontrolled immigration, rampant crime and searing economic pain. The most extraordinary aspect of the debate is that it takes place less than a month after Trump was convicted in a criminal hush money case in New York. Biden has already highlighted the guilty verdict in campaign events, but Trump insists that he\u2019s the victim of an attempt to weaponize the legal system to interfere in the election. Both candidates are facing extreme pressure Both men will hope to avoid the kind of debate night gaffes or odd personal quirks that have often gone viral and dominated critical post-debate media coverage that helps cement the perception of who won and who lost in voters\u2019 minds. Vice President Al Gore\u2019s theatrical sighs in 2000 and President George H.W. Bush\u2019s unwise glance at his watch in 1992 both became emblems of losing campaigns. The risks are now much higher because of social media. Presidential debates don\u2019t always decide who wins in November. But the tension surrounding this year\u2019s first debate in June, rather than in September or October as usual, is palpable. \u201cThe closer the election, the greater the chance that a debate could influence it,\u201d said Aaron Kall, director of debate at the University of Michigan, who has conducted an in-depth study of every presidential debate. \u201cA lot of times these mistakes reaffirm a caricature of one of the particular candidates that existed before it happened.\u201d For Biden, that means no senior moments, and Trump would be advised to avoid outbursts that confirm Biden\u2019s characterization of a tyrant in waiting. Neither Trump nor Biden has debated since their final clash in the pandemic-disrupted 2020 campaign. And their preparation for one of the most important nights of their lives has reflected their character and political personas. The president has been out of sight for days, huddled below the oaks, poplars and maple trees at the Camp David retreat with advisers, strategizing how to handle the most challenging debate foe in history. Fueled by lasagna and tacos, he\u2019s taken part in mock debates, immersed himself in briefing binders and tried to anticipate Trump\u2019s wild twists and diversions. It\u2019s a debate camp in keeping with Biden\u2019s view that he\u2019s locked in an existential election duel with the soul of the nation on the line. The former president hates mock debates and has instead honed his preparation at rallies and events, trusting his instincts and intuition and a feral sense of an opponent\u2019s political weakness. He has, however, had policy refresher sessions with aides and some potential vice-presidential picks including Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Biden has raised the stakes for himself heading into the debate higher than those any modern president faced. He argues Trump is a criminal in whom something has \u201csnapped\u201d and who is too dangerous and reckless to be let back into the White House. He\u2019s also rebuked Trump for using Nazi-style language and warned democracy and freedom are on the ballot along with the capacity of \u2018We the People\u2019 to shape America\u2019s destiny. Preparing for anything at Camp David Biden\u2019s debate team is led by former White House chief of staff Ron Klain, who has been prepping Democrats for presidential debates for a generation. One of Klain\u2019s mantras is \u201cwhile you can lose a debate any time, you can only win it in the first 30 minutes.\u201d Biden is therefore expected to front-load the most important points to appeal to the likely highest rated part of the primetime event. The Biden team has been poring over Trump\u2019s recent public interviews and speeches while workshopping responses to whatever he and the moderators may throw Biden\u2019s way. The president will be ready for whichever version of Trump shows up \u2013 whether it\u2019s the bombastic opponent who talked over and insulted him in their first clash in 2020, or a more restrained challenger seeking to project stability. If Trump aims for a presidential bearing, Biden has a locker full of practiced attacks and rebuttals designed to provoke him into making the outbursts that could turn voters off. A Biden adviser told CNN that debate preparations have included getting the president ready to respond should Trump get personal\u00a0 \u2014 weeks after his son Hunter was convicted of felony gun charges. Biden\u2019s love and protective instinct for his family is always close to the surface, and he reacted furiously when the then-president brought up Hunter during their first debate in 2020. Biden has been running through his paces inside a large hangar at the Maryland retreat, where there\u2019s a mock debate stage complete with bright television lights. His personal attorney, Bob Bauer, is playing Trump and other aides have sat in as CNN moderators Dana Bash and Jake Tapper. But sources told CNN that the debate practice was about more than feeling comfortable. It\u2019s also about answering the age question. Aides and allies of the president alike have frequently pointed to his State of the Union address in March as a model example of Biden at his best. He was energetic, focused and nimble, they\u2019ve argued, over the course of his 67-minute prime-time speech. Trump\u2019s debate prep is as unorthodox as he is Sitting presidents often have a rude awakening at first presidential debates, since they are unused to anyone getting in their grill and contradicting them. But Trump\u2019s advantage on this score may be compromised since he refused to debate any of his GOP primary rivals this year. Still, his aggressive debate style isn\u2019t much different from the belligerent, spiky attitude he displays in most public events. Trump has warmed up for the debate by suggesting that Biden will be \u201cjacked up\u201d on drugs, as his aides frantically have tried to dismantle the expectations trap that the ex-president constructed for himself by suggesting that Biden is so mentally diminished that he can barely stand up or finish a sentence. In any other era, the idea of a candidate accusing an opponent of doping would be unthinkable. But Trump\u2019s tactic is a reminder of a presidency and a political style that has shattered all previous norms. In a new memo on Wednesday, Trump\u2019s campaign signaled that the ex-president would assail Biden over immigration and the economy. It boasted about polling averages that his team says show the former president up in all the key states. And Trump, whose administration created a gale of daily falsehoods, characteristically worked to accuse Biden of the very transgression that is most associated with him \u2014 lying. \u201cThe man is a walking lying machine and a fact-checker\u2019s dream,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social, while accusing Biden, one of the best presidential golfers, of being unable to hit a ball 10 yards. Trump\u2019s unorthodox approach means that the country may get another reminder of the chaos, discord and cacophony that it experienced in his four years in office \u2014 and that his supporters love and want to restore. But it\u2019s also a risk that could play into Biden\u2019s desire to get voters to see the contrast between the 45th and 46th presidents that he believes could deliver him the election. Former Obama speechwriter Terry Szuplat said successful debate performances tell a coherent story of where the country is and where it is going. \u201cIt\u2019s a story about yourself. Why you\u2019re the right candidate. Why the other candidate is the wrong candidate.\u00a0And it\u2019s a story about the future. Every election is about the future. It\u2019s a choice about the future,\u201d Szuplat told CNN\u2019s Kasie Hunt. Neither Trump nor Biden has so far fulfilled that goal. Thursday is the best chance to do so.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/politics/presidential-debate-trump-biden/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_06_25_politics_biden-trump-debate-issues-analysis", "text": "Presidential debates crystalize a quadrennial dilemma for a country contemplating a new political direction. But they\u2019re usually defined more by trivial personality quirks, zeitgeist moments and gaffes than high-level ideological argument. Al Gore\u2019s melodramatic sighs, George H.W. Bush\u2019s unwise glance at his watch, a day\u2019s growth on Richard Nixon\u2019s chin and Donald Trump\u2019s bulk looming over Hillary Clinton remain iconic years after the policy clashes in those debates have been forgotten. And while Thursday night\u2019s debate hosted by CNN between President Joe Biden and ex-President Trump could also turn on a theatrical flurry between two men who openly despise one another, the policy meat of a presidential debate has rarely been so important as in this neck-and-neck White House race. The country is confronting a perilous moment, internally estranged over politics and culture and as multiple foreign policy crises deepen. America faces a choice in November that will lead, like in Robert Frost\u2019s poem, down one of two divergent roads from which there may be no coming back. A charged political backdrop to a vital debate Trump\u2019s attempt to regain the White House, less than four years after he attempted to steal the last election, poses a potentially existential question for the democratic system. The former president\u2019s conservative backers are, meanwhile, proposing an evisceration of the bureaucracy and the politicization of judicial and intelligence leadership posts to reconcile the goals of a GOP candidate sporting one criminal conviction, three other indictments and a thirst for revenge. At the same time, and despite a roaring jobs market, millions of Americans are worn down by high prices and the cost of borrowing. The legacy of a once-in-a-generation pandemic robbed the country of a sense of economic security that Biden promised to restore four years ago but that remains elusive for many. The Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of the constitutional right to an abortion two years ago has opened an ideological and religious schism over reproductive rights that Biden plans to exploit to hurt Trump. But the president is equally vulnerable over an immigration crisis on the southern border that has swamped asylum laws unfit to handle a new generation of migrants fleeing gangs, economic blight and climate disasters. Overseas, there\u2019s a frightening sense of fracturing. The global system that has enshrined American power for 80 years is under extreme pressure from US foes seeking to destroy it, including Russia and the new superpower China. Biden has dedicated his term to expanding NATO to counter the Kremlin\u2019s onslaught on Ukraine and threat to wider Europe. In one rare area of continuity with Trump, he\u2019s intensified a military and diplomatic pivot to counter China, although the ex-president\u2019s plan for a tariff war with Beijing would go far beyond Biden\u2019s efforts to stop a new Cold War turning hot. Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, which incessantly threatens to boil over, is a painful vulnerability for a sitting president, as his rival warns that World War III may be about to spark. Trump\u2019s main critique is that Biden is weak \u2013 a caricature that could resonate with some voters. But his own plans are as nebulous as his unlikely plan to end the Ukraine war in 24 hours and his unprovable claim that conflicts in Europe and the Middle East would \u201cnever have happened\u201d if he\u2019d been in office. And Trump seems more at home with authoritarians like Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who dream of crushing US power, than democratic allies America liberated in the last cataclysmic global conflict. Some of the ex-president\u2019s former White House officials warn he might try to pull the United States out of NATO, the cornerstone of Western security, if he returns to the White House. Voters must therefore pick between Biden\u2019s traditional internationalist foreign policies and a doubling down by Trump of the populist isolationism that turned the United States from the bulwark of global stability into one of its most volatile sources of instability. Two legacies on display For the first time in American history, two presidents will stand side-by-side on a debate stage with their legacies exposed for everyone to judge. (The only other time a former and current president competed for a second term was in 1892, when candidates didn\u2019t actively campaign, let alone debate one another.) The meeting of incumbents is one most voters would have preferred to avoid. And so far, their fears seem to be realized. The tied race means two candidates either side of 80 are struggling to show they\u2019ve got the policies to fix the nation\u2019s problems. And neither so far has shown the vision to conjure a road map to the future that millions of Americans will inhabit long after both are gone. Trump\u2019s first term and sparse legislative record showed that he sees the presidency more as a channel for his wild personal whims rather than a policy laboratory. But his campaign, as well as allied conservative groups, have drawn up plans that, if implemented, would transform American governance. And a second-term administration stripped of restraining influences that frustrated the 45th president means he\u2019d have far more latitude to do what he wants. One irony of Trump\u2019s first term \u2014 and second term proposals \u2014 is that while he\u2019s shifted the Republican Party away from its corporate heritage toward a more working-class orientation, he pursues policies that disproportionately help richer Americans like himself. In his first term, he enacted tax cuts that favored the better off and he wants to extend them if he gets back the White House. Still, earlier this month, in an apparent bid to court support from hospitality workers in the key state of Nevada, he pledged to eliminate federal taxes on tips. And while he\u2019s proposing a draconian immigration policy, including mass deportations of undocumented migrants, Trump also says he wants more green cards for foreign graduates of US colleges \u2014 a step that may win favor among increasingly influential South Asian voters. The former president has also signaled he\u2019d dismiss Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, in a move that would raise concerns of political interference in the central bank but that could please Americans who want interest rate cuts. And the former president is working hard to enhance nostalgia for the Trump economy that was thriving before the pandemic-induced economic crisis. If he concentrates on economic messaging rather than histrionics on Thursday night, the former president may be able to renew a connection with viewers alienated by his extreme behavior but who pine for easier economic times. Still, Biden is likely to argue that some of Trump\u2019s plans would be economically ruinous, including a proposed 10% tariff on foreign goods that some economists warn could reignite the inflation crisis and raise the cost of goods for US consumers. Biden has a humming policy machine. Several times a week, the president or Vice President Kamala Harris highlights a new aspect of the administration\u2019s attempt to honor its vows to reshape the economy, to lift up working Americans, to cut health care costs, cap drugs prices, create jobs, fight climate change, preserve abortion rights, reduce student debt and lower energy costs. But it is the curse of Biden\u2019s term that his efforts rarely get much credit despite a legislative legacy that is as impressive as any Democrat since President Lyndon Johnson. Part of this may lie in the fact that measures like Biden\u2019s bipartisan infrastructure plan may take years to fully come into force. The president is still yet to figure out a way to claim credit for an economy that rebounded more strongly from the Covid-19 emergency than those of other developed countries while also acknowledging the pain many voters still feel. High grocery prices represent a literal and psychological barrier \u2014 even if the worst inflation crisis in 40 years has now moderated. It\u2019s still hard for many Americans to afford a new car or a mortgage because of high interest rates introduced to lower the cost of living. This leaves Biden badly needing to use Thursday night\u2019s debate to convince voters that he can make their lives better \u2014 and soon. He\u2019s tried it once already. During his State of the Union address in March, Biden praised citizens for authoring \u201cthe greatest comeback story.\u201d But it didn\u2019t do him any good politically. \u00a0In an ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted in late April, voters said they trusted Trump more than Biden on the economy and inflation, their top two issues, by margins of 46% to 32% and 44% to 30%. Post-game coverage of Thursday\u2019s debate is certain to zero in on the best verbal jabs, soundbites and the stamina and energy of the rival candidates.

I think it was her polite way of getting me to shut up, but it\u2019s good advice even if her ultimate goal was a little quiet in the King family kitchen. Listening is a lost art in our politics. And, too often, in our political coverage. Everyday Americans are ignored, or given a quote or soundbite here and there, while most of the attention goes to the ever louder partisan bombast. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 we need to cover what the politicians say. And what their ads say. And fact check it all. But our All Over the Map project is an attempt to shift the balance a bit. To listen. To learn. We have been at it 10 months now, and we are learning a ton from voters who are literally all over the map \u2013 in every way. Now, with a presidential debate looming on Thursday and a consequential election heading into the final stretch, we invite you to listen with us \u2013 in a way that goes beyond what we can do on television or in written dispatches. All Over the Map, in podcast form, comes to CNN Audio today, so we can share our voters\u2019 stories in more detail. You can hear people wrestle with their choices and explain the life experiences shaping their politics. A CNN series that began in Iowa and New Hampshire as the primary season took off now includes voters in South Carolina, Virginia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada and Arizona. Mom was right. You learn when you listen. My biggest lesson so far: Yes, there are huge differences in polarized America. But voters are not only willing but eager to have the tough conversations many politicians avoid. Most are willing to discuss the compromises politicians refuse to make. Economic anxiety is easy to find, as are doubts about the candidates. In our first episode, Nikki Haley voters share their thoughts, and their frustrations, with their two choices for president. There are enough supporters of the former South Carolina governor, who ended her GOP primary bid in March, to swing the election \u2013 so we wanted to visit a few in battleground Pennsylvania ahead of the first Biden-Trump debate. You will meet Linda Rooney and Michael Pesce and you will hear the torment of self-identified Reagan Republicans who want their party back from Trump but run afoul of their GOP DNA when they ponder voting to reelect a Democratic president. It is fascinating to listen to voters who start in the same place but take different turns when staring at the Trump-Biden crossroads. Rooney, from Media, Pennsylvania, in the Philadelphia suburbs, gives voice to a theme we hear a ton in our travels. She voted for Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020. \u201cI\u2019m sad that we only have these two choices honestly,\u201d Rooney told us. \u201cI\u2019m tired of celebrities sort of being in politics. I don\u2019t like Trump, but I have to say we were, for us, personally, we were better off when he was president. I don\u2019t like how he\u2019s so unreliable in some ways. You never know what he\u2019s going to do next. I just want a normal person. Like, I just want someone normal. I don\u2019t want a celebrity, and I don\u2019t have confidence in Biden. So, I feel like I don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d But she promised to vote, and it is not lost on her that the Pennsylvania winner tends to be the national winner. Pesce is both part of the generation that changed American politics 40 years ago and the suburban shift that is reshaping our politics today. He lives in Doylestown, in competitive Bucks County, and, like Rooney, was a Trump voter in 2016 and a Biden voter in 2020. \u201cI became a Republican when I turned 18 because of Ronald Reagan,\u201d said Pesce, a Coast Guard veteran who works in a meat processing plant. \u201cI\u2019m a Reagan Republican. I like that version of conservatism. I like that version of America. His version of \u2018America First.\u2019 That we are the leaders of the free world. We are the leaders of the world military. This is what we stand for. And I\u2019m like, yeah, that\u2019s what I want to be.\u201d Down the road, we visit one of America\u2019s newest presidential battlegrounds and meet two voters whose 2024 choices \u2013 and conversations \u2013 are shaped by Biden\u2019s map-changing 2020 win in Georgia. And we explore the cracks in the Biden coalition that make his reelection math, and map, so challenging. A Palestinian American law school student in Dearborn, Michigan, gives voice to the anger young voters and Arab American voters feel over Biden\u2019s handling of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. A Black entrepreneur in Milwaukee shares his take on the economic decline in neighborhoods that once offered a path to the middle class through factory jobs. I hope you will consider joining our journey. A few minutes into any voter conversation, you might feel no connection to someone who lives far away from you and perhaps has a very different life experience or political views. My bet, though, is by the end, something will connect you or stir your own thoughts about an issue or the candidates. We are just a bit over four months to Election Day now, and we know that the race is close, that the third-party candidates make the state-by-state math complicated and that voters who don\u2019t much like either major-party candidate will decide who wins. Maybe you fit in this group. Maybe you are certain about your choice and can\u2019t understand that frustration. I hope you can share a little time with us, and learn by listening.

{"id": "2024_06_13_politics_tax-cuts-expiring-trump-biden", "text": "Whoever wins the presidency in November will have some especially tough financial choices to make next year. More than $3.4 trillion in individual income and estate tax cuts \u2013 heralded by Republicans for spurring economic growth and largely decried by Democrats for disproportionately benefitting the rich \u2013 are set to expire at the end of 2025. Add in some corporate tax changes and interest, and the impact on the deficit swells to $4.6 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That means the parties whom voters select to control the White House and Congress next year will be particularly consequential. President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 presidential nominees, have already laid out general positions on how they\u2019d handle the lapsing provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, one of the signature achievements of Trump and the GOP-led Congress in his first term. Trump and Biden\u2019s Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen are scheduled to speak Thursday to business leaders at different venues, where they are expected to touch on tax provisions. In keeping with Biden\u2019s long-standing policy promises, the president has said that he would allow the income tax cuts for the rich to expire while protecting those who earn less than $400,000 annually from any tax hikes. Plus, he has proposed raising the corporate tax rate to 28%, up from the 21% rate that the TCJA put in place permanently \u2013 which, along with higher taxes on the wealthy, would help pay for extending tax cuts for most other Americans, he argues. \u201cDonald Trump was very proud of his $2 trillion tax cut that overwhelmingly benefited the wealthy and biggest corporations and exploded the federal debt,\u201d Biden posted on X in April, citing the original 10-year cost estimate. \u201cThat tax cut is going to expire. If I\u2019m reelected, it\u2019s going to stay expired.\u201d Trump, meanwhile, has promised big tax cuts for people of all incomes, as well as for businesses. And he told a crowd of wealthy donors at a fundraising dinner in April that one of his core issues for a second term would be extending the law\u2019s sweeping array of tax cuts \u2013 a view echoed recently by House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Republicans. \u201cInstead of a Biden tax hike, I\u2019ll give you a Trump middle class, upper class, lower class, business class big tax cut,\u201d Trump said at a rally in New Jersey in May. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have the biggest tax cut.\u201d Biden and some Democratic lawmakers also see the looming battle as an opportunity to revive or extend other popular but pricey tax provisions, including the enhanced child tax credit, which was in place only for 2021, and the more generous Obamacare premium subsidies, which expire at the end of next year. Both were contained in the American Rescue Plan Act that congressional Democrats pushed through Congress soon after Biden was inaugurated in 2021. But how Congress handles the TCJA\u2019s expiring tax provisions likely won\u2019t be that simple, experts say. There are many costly measures to contend with, and their fate will have big implications for both taxpayers and the federal budget. Another consideration: Will lawmakers agree to pay for at least part of any extensions through other measures? It\u2019s also possible that a deeply fractured Congress won\u2019t be able to come to a resolution, which could prompt lawmakers to kick the can down the road and temporarily extend the provisions \u2013 as they did in 2010 when the big tax cut packages passed during the George W. Bush administration were about to sunset. Most of those measures were made permanent in 2013. A multitude of tax cuts The TCJA contained a bevy of individual income and corporate tax reductions, making it one of the largest tax cut packages in US history. Unlike the individual income tax provisions, most of the corporate measures are permanent. Here are some of the key things the law did that lapse at the end of next year: In addition, the law temporarily created a special deduction for the owners of certain pass-through entities who pay their business taxes on their individual tax returns. The deduction, which also expires at the end of 2025, allows these taxpayers to exclude up to 20% of their business income from their federal income tax. These so-called pass-through businesses include partnerships, such as those formed by lawyers, doctors or investors. Also, congressional Republicans included a handful of corporate tax increases in the TCJA to offset part of its cost \u2013 the largest of which ends businesses\u2019 ability to immediately deduct the cost of their US-based research. Instead, they have to write off the expense over five years. Some GOP lawmakers are trying to unwind those increases in exchange for augmenting the child tax credit, which Democrats have sought to do. But the bipartisan package is stalled in the Senate, with some in Congress arguing it should be part of the tax reform debate next year. What\u2019s not expiring are the law\u2019s main corporate tax measures, which include reducing the corporate rate from 35% to 21% and shifting to more of a territorial tax system for US multinational firms. Prior to the TCJA, American companies had to pay taxes on all their profits no matter where the income was earned, though they could defer the tax bill until they brought the money home \u2013 giving them the incentive to park the profits overseas. Now, these firms don\u2019t owe taxes on certain types of income repatriated from abroad. In addition, the law created a number of minimum taxes to prevent companies from avoiding taxes. While the TCJA reduced taxes for most people, the rich benefited far more than others. More than 60% of the benefits were expected to go to those whose incomes are in the top 20%, according to a 2018 analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan research group. More than 40% of the benefits were expected to go to those in the top 5%. Those making between $500,000 and $1 million were expected to get an average tax cut of about $21,000, lifting their after-tax incomes by 4.3%, according to the center\u2019s estimates. Those who earn $1 million or more would enjoy an average tax cut of about $70,000, raising their after-tax incomes by 3.3%. Only a little more than a quarter of those in the lowest-income households would see their taxes reduced. Their tax cut would be about $200, on average. However, most would see little or no benefit. If the tax cuts are extended, the pattern of who benefits is likely to be similar, according to the center. Big implications for the federal budget Allowing the individual income tax cuts for the wealthy to expire would wallop a small but influential set of American taxpayers, but extending all the provisions would greatly increase the federal deficit. These two factors will complicate the conversations on Capitol Hill. The debate will come at a time when the nation\u2019s fiscal health is in the spotlight. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle \u2013 particularly Republicans \u2013 have repeatedly voiced concerns about the US deficit and debt levels. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has warned that the nation is on \u201can unsustainable fiscal path.\u201d And even before Congress addresses the expiring tax cuts, it will have to contend with the return of the federal debt ceiling in January, which is expected to spark more heated discussions over the size of the nation\u2019s budget. Extending the individual and estate tax provisions would add more than $3.4 trillion to the federal deficits over a decade, while addressing certain business tax changes could add about another $550 billion, according to the latest CBO estimate released last month. In addition, interest costs would rise by more than $600 billion. While Republicans often argue that tax cuts pay for themselves, the effects of the TCJA are a matter of debate. Complicating the analysis is the arrival of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, which temporarily threw the economy into a tailspin and prompted Congress to approve trillions of dollars in stimulus and relief spending, as well as the surge in inflation in recent years. The law\u2019s supporters say that it accelerated economic growth and business investment, spurred companies to bring profits back to the US and raised household incomes. They argue that it\u2019s crucial to extend or make permanent the expiring provisions or those gains will be lost. Tadd Fowler, treasurer and senior vice president for global taxes at Procter & Gamble, ticked off the impact of the TCJA on the multinational consumer goods manufacturer at a recent Tax Foundation event. Some 44% of the company\u2019s sales are now in the US, compared with 39% prior to the act, thanks to increased domestic investment that led to greater demand for its products. Procter & Gamble has made close to $6 billion in new manufacturing investments in the US and added more than 4,000 new jobs since the law\u2019s passage. It also repatriates nearly $7 billion a year, up from about $1 billion annually in the years immediately preceding the TCJA. \u201cWe\u2019re a great example of what can happen with pro-growth and competitive tax policies,\u201d Fowler said, noting the law has \u201cpromoted a healthy investment climate in the US and a system that levels the playing field for US companies relative to our global competitors.\u201d Opponents, meanwhile, contend that the rich benefited most from the law, and that there\u2019s little evidence that any economic rewards trickled down to other Americans. Some scoff at the Trump administration\u2019s promise that the tax cuts would boost household wages by $4,000. Instead, tax revenue as a share of the US economy has fallen compared with projections, contributing to deeper deficits, while stock buybacks skyrocketed, benefitting investors. \u201cMost Americans saw very little from TCJA,\u201d Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive policy group, said at a Politico event last month. \u201cThe benefits really, really skewed to the very, very wealthiest Americans.\u201d Also, the faster economic growth that could be spurred by extending the expiring provisions would only pay for between 1% to 14% of the cost of continuing the measures, according to a recent Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget review of analyses from four organizations spanning the ideological spectrum and comments from the CBO\u2019s director. \u201cIt dramatically worsens a fiscal situation that\u2019s already headed in the wrong direction,\u201d said Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at the committee. \u201cThe last thing we need is to cut out some of our biggest revenue sources.\u201d CORRECTION: This story has been\u00a0updated to reflect the\u00a0correct\u00a0information from the Tax Policy Center\u00a0about the distribution of tax benefits from the 2017 law.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/politics/tax-cuts-expiring-trump-biden/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_politics_epa-ohio-smog-supreme-court", "text": "The Supreme Court on Thursday upended a Biden administration effort to\u202freduce smog and air pollution\u202fwafting across state lines in the latest decision from the high court that undermined the federal government\u2019s power to protect the environment. The decision is a win for the Republican-led states and industry groups that challenged the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s \u201cgood neighbor\u201d plan, which imposed strict emission limits on power plants and industrial sources in upwind states to reduce pollution for their counterparts downwind. While the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on Thursday to grant a stay technically doesn\u2019t completely scuttle the plan, it places implementation of the Biden program on hold through what will be a complicated legal fight that will almost uncertainly continue past the November election and into next year \u2013 and possibly another presidential administration. Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote the opinion for a 5-4 majority. Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote a dissent, joined by the three liberal justices, that said the court was intervening too quickly without seeing the full development of the case\u2019s record in lower court proceedings. \u201cOur emergency docket requires us to evaluate quickly the merits of applications without the benefit of full briefing and reasoned lower court opinions,\u201d Barrett wrote. \u201cGiven those limitations, we should proceed all the more cautiously in cases like this one with voluminous, technical records and thorny legal questions.\u201d Barrett\u2019s dissent from the rest of the conservative wing is notable. During oral arguments for the case, she and the three liberal justices had questioned whether the Supreme Court should grant the request to halt the plan given that lower courts have barely reviewed the underlying legal dispute involved. The decision represents the latest major setback the Supreme Court has delivered to environmental regulators, as well as to President Joe Biden\u2019s climate and environmental agenda. In 2022, the court\u2019s conservative majority limited EPA\u2019s ability to regulate carbon emissions\u202ffrom power plants. Last year, it curbed its authority to regulate wetlands. Biden officials and downwind states such as New York, Connecticut and Delaware warned of \u201cdangerous ozone spikes\u201d affecting the health of residents \u2013 particularly children and the elderly \u2013 if the court sided with Ohio, Indiana and West Virginia, the states that filed the emergency appeal. In a statement, an EPA spokesperson said the agency was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with Thursday\u2019s ruling, \u201cwhich will postpone the benefits that the Good Neighbor Plan is already achieving in many states and communities.\u201d The EPA spokesperson stressed that the stay was not a final decision on whether the EPA\u2019s smog rule was lawful, and that the stay would only remain in place while it\u2019s being litigated in lower courts. \u201cThe agency believes that the Good Neighbor Plan is firmly grounded in its Clean Air Act authority and looks forward to defending the merits of this vital public health protection before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals,\u201d the EPA spokesperson said. White House spokesperson Angelo Fernandez-Hernandez said the Biden administration will \u201ccontinue to take ambitious action that protects our communities, especially those who\u2019ve disproportionately shouldered the burden of pollution.\u201d The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to occasionally review interstate pollution rules to ensure they align with the latest health guidelines. The Obama administration updated the standards in 2015 and states were then required to submit plans within three years showing how they would meet those new goals. Biden\u2019s EPA strengthened the rule in March under a court-ordered deadline, after it languished without any updates during the Trump administration. The plan\u2019s opponents warned it could \u201cdestabilize the states\u2019 power grids.\u201d But the Biden administration had countered that those predictions were based on \u201cspeculative allegations\u201d that some power plants may be required to shut down \u201cat some future point.\u201d In a statement, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, called Thursday\u2019s Supreme Court decision \u201ccorrect,\u201d adding, \u201cthe country\u2019s power grid is already stressed as it is, and now this administration is attempting to add more regulation that\u2019s going to stress the grid even more.\u201d The Biden administration noted that many of the plan\u2019s requirements wouldn\u2019t go into effect until 2026 and questioned the urgent ruling from the court that the industry and GOP-led states had sought. They also noted that the Clean Air Act, initially approved by Congress in the 1960s, requires many of the steps the agency took to protect air quality in downwind states. The latest ruling comes during a pivotal election year in which many young voters in particular are seeking climate action from the White House, and it is the first of two opinions the Supreme Court is expected to hand down this term that could have major implications for how the EPA regulates clean air and water. The second case, Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, could overturn a 1984 decision known as the Chevron deference \u2013 a legal test that gives federal agencies wide latitude to put forth regulations and compels courts to defer to agencies in many cases. Gorsuch is widely seen as a lead advocate for overturning Chevron. He is the son of\u00a0Reagan-appointed EPA administrator Anne Gorsuch, who oversaw a period of anti-environmental regulations during her tenure. CNN\u2019s Arlette Saenz contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_06_27_politics_supreme-court-limits-power-of-sec-to-unilaterally-enforce-financial-fraud-regulations", "text": "The Supreme Court on Thursday limited the power of the Securities and Exchange Commission to enforce security fraud violations, siding with a hedge fund manager and former conservative radio show host who said he was entitled to a jury trial rather than an in-house review by the agency. The decision could have enormous consequences for the SEC and other agencies, requiring them to pursue violations in federal court rather than with a more streamlined internal review. That could make it harder to police fraud and protect investors while adding to federal court backlogs. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the decision for a 6-3 majority, with the court\u2019s three liberals in dissent. The Supreme Court declined to address more existential challenges to the agency\u2019s enforcement structure, including claims that could have severely undermined the government\u2019s ability to use in-house administrative law judges or protect them from the political whims of a president. \u201cA defendant facing a fraud suit has the right to be tried by a jury of his peers before a neutral adjudicator,\u201d Roberts wrote. \u201cRather than recognize that right,\u201d the chief wrote that his dissenting colleagues would \u201cpermit Congress to concentrate the roles of prosecutor, judge, and jury in the hands of the executive branch.\u201d \u201cThat is the very opposite of the separation of powers that the Constitution demands,\u201d he wrote. Sotomayor reads dissent from the bench A dissent by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, signed by the court\u2019s two other liberals, called Thursday\u2019s ruling a \u201cpower grab\u201d that \u201cupends longstanding precedent and the established practice of its coequal partners in our tripartite system of government.\u201d She said \u201cmomentous consequences that flow from the majority\u2019s insistence that the Government\u2019s rights to civil penalties must now be tried before a jury in federal court.\u201d \u201cToday\u2019s ruling is part of a disconcerting trend: When it comes to the separation of powers, this court tells the American public and its coordinate branches that it knows best,\u201d Sotomayor wrote, later adding that whether to use a system of in-house agency adjudication was a policy decision that should be made by Congress. \u201cMake no mistake: Today\u2019s decision is a power grab,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt prescribes artificial constraints on what modern-day adaptable governance must look like.\u201d But the court\u2019s decision was far more narrow than it could have been. The court of appeals in Louisiana, which also ruled against the SEC, embraced a wider series of arguments that could have hobbled enforcement by several agencies. Instead of dealing with those questions, Roberts focused entirely on the question of whether the Seventh Amendment requires jury trials for the types of actions at issue. George Jarkesy, the hedge fund manager at the center of the dispute, applauded the court\u2019s ruling, saying the \u201cramifications of this case are so much bigger than one person.\u201d \u201cAfter a decade of gross misconduct and blatantly unconstitutional political attacks from the SEC and their in-house court, today the United States Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution still matters,\u201d he said in a statement. Federal agency power in the crosshairs The case, one of several this term challenging the power of federal agencies, arose in 2013 when the SEC brought an enforcement action for securities fraud against Jarkesy, who established two hedge funds that held about $24 million in assets and brought in over 100 investors. The agency accused Jarkesy of overvaluing assets so he could charge higher fees. An administrative law judge \u2013 an in-house agency employee who adjudicates such claims \u2013 sustained the allegations and ordered Jarkesy to pay a civil penalty of $300,000 and to repay nearly $685,000 in \u201cill-gotten gains.\u201d Jarkesy not only challenged the decision but also the process used to reach it. He claimed the in-house procedure violated the 7th Amendment\u2019s right to a jury trial. He also said the way the agency\u2019s administrative law judges are appointed violates other provisions of the Constitution because the president is barred from removing them in most circumstances. Such protections were put in place in the 1940s to insulate in-agency law judges from politics and criticism that the proceedings were biased in favor of the agencies they worked for. The SEC\u2019s administrative law judges may only be removed \u201cfor cause\u201d by the SEC\u2019s commissioners, who also may only be removed for cause. The SEC consists of five members appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The commission can enforce a variety of federal statutes in two ways. It can institute administrative enforcement proceedings seeking civil penalties, or it may bring civil actions in federal court. The 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals backed Jarkesy on three constitutional claims. It held that certain SEC proceedings deprive individuals of their right to a jury. It said Congress improperly delegated legislative power to the SEC, giving the agency authority to choose the in-house administrative route rather than a federal court. And it said that the way administrative law judges were protected from removal violated constitutional principles of presidential power. Other agencies use similar in-house judges to review fraud claims, including the Department of Labor and the Social Security Administration. The SEC case is one of several before the Supreme Court this year attempting to undermine the power of federal agencies. A pair of cases argued in mid-January challenged the ability of agencies to interpret vague laws when they set regulations. Another involved the funding mechanism for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency created after the 2008 financial crisis. A 7-2 majority upheld that funding structure on May 16 in an opinion written by Justice Clarence Thomas that represented a significant win for the Biden administration.

{"id": "2024_06_26_politics_supreme-court-abortion-idaho-bloomberg", "text": "The Supreme Court appears poised to temporarily allow abortions in medical emergencies in Idaho, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday, citing a document that was inadvertently posted on the court\u2019s website in an astonishing breach of protocol. The unsigned opinion showed that three conservatives \u2013 Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett \u2013 sided with the court\u2019s three liberals to block the state from enforcing the ban in certain emergency situations. The court acknowledged a document was briefly posted, but stressed that no opinion is final until announced by the justices. The abortion case is considered among the most significant of the current term that is winding down ahead of the July 4 holiday. It\u2019s the second time in two years that a major decision dealing with an abortion case has been prematurely released. Two years ago, Politico obtained a draft of the high court\u2019s opinion overturning Roe v. Wade \u2013 a document that was substantially the same as the final opinion the court released weeks later. At issue is Idaho\u2019s strict abortion ban, which provides an exception for the life of the pregnant woman. The Biden administration argued that a federal law also requires hospitals to perform abortions in cases where the health of the pregnant woman is at stake. The decision means that an order from a trial judge that had blocked enforcement of Idaho\u2019s abortion ban in medical emergencies would go back into effect while the case continues to be argued in lower courts. Such a ruling is a temporary win for the Biden administration and will be a relief to Idaho women who fear medical complications from their pregnancies could jeopardize their heath. But it would leave unresolved the central question of whether federal law protects access to abortion in medical emergencies, and it is not likely to end the precariousness and uncertainty that doctors have felt about how to navigate strict abortion bans while caring for their patients. \u201cIf the reporting is accurate, this would be a significant but temporary victory for the Biden administration,\u201d said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. A Supreme Court spokeswoman, Patricia McCabe,  confirmed that a \u201cdocument\u201d was \u201cinadvertently and briefly uploaded\u201d to the court\u2019s website. She stressed that the opinion in the case \u201chas not been released\u201d and would be \u201cissued in due course.\u201d Here\u2019s what to know about what happened Wednesday: Where the conservatives and liberals agreed The copy reviewed by Bloomberg showed the court voting 6-3 to allow the emergency abortions to take place in Idaho on a temporary basis while the case continues. But they did so for slightly different reasons. The court\u2019s three liberals argued in a concurrence by Justice Elena Kagan that the court erred when it allowed the state to enforce the law temporarily while the Supreme Court considered the case. The state ban, Kagan wrote, \u201cprevents hospitals from doing\u201d what the federal law commands. The decision \u201cwill again give Idaho women access to all the needed medical treatments that EMTALA guarantees.\u201d Justice Amy Coney Barrett, in a separate concurrence joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, made a slightly different point. Barrett argued that Idaho appears to be able to enforce its ban \u201cin the vast majority of circumstances.\u201d Barrett\u2019s point is that she doesn\u2019t believe there\u2019s a significant conflict between the Biden administration and Idaho because of changes that were made to the Idaho law as the litigation unfolded. The Department of Justice and the White House declined to comment on Bloomberg\u2019s story and the mistakenly posted document until the Supreme Court\u2019s official opinion is released. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson agreed with the decision to temporarily block enforcement of the Idaho ban but she dissented from the court\u2019s decision to dismiss the case. Liberals and abortion-rights groups worry about the future case How abortion bans have been playing out in medical emergencies has emerged as a particularly explosive political flashpoint in the fallout of Roe v. Wade\u2019s reversal. The Idaho ban at issue allowed abortions if a pregnant woman\u2019s life was at stake, but not her health. Six states have bans like Idaho\u2019s that include no exception for the health of a pregnant woman, the Justice Department has said, though several of those laws are the subject of litigation. The Biden administration argued Idaho\u2019s ban could force patients to, for instance, endure hysterectomies and other lifelong complications if doctors declined to provide an abortion in the emergency room. A US District Court in Idaho last year blocked enforcement of the state law. A three-judge panel of the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals paused that decision, allowing the law to take effect. Weeks later, the full 9th Circuit reversed the panel\u2019s decision, putting enforcement of the law on hold again. In January, the Supreme Court\u00a0agreed to decide the case\u00a0and allowed the state law to take effect while it did so. Abortion-rights groups have been careful not to celebrate the finding in the document, instead saying that the justices\u2019 ruling would merely delay a future decision that may restrict abortion access in emergency situations. Jackson wrote separately to say that she wouldn\u2019t have dismissed the case. \u201cToday\u2019s decision is not a victory for pregnant patients in Idaho. It is delay,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhile this court dawdles and the country waits, pregnant people experiencing emergency medical conditions remain in a precarious position, as their doctors are kept in the dark about what the law requires.\u201d It was particularly wrong, Jackson said, because the court had for months allowed Idaho\u2019s strict abortion law to remain in effect. \u201cIt is too little, too late for the Court to take a mulligan and just tell the lower courts to carry on as if none of this has happened,\u201d Jackson wrote. The Justice Department sued Idaho over its abortion ban in August 2022, a few weeks before it was scheduled to take effect. It argued that a federal law known as the Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act \u2013 or EMTALA \u2013 required hospitals that receive Medicare funding to offer the procedure in medical emergencies. The law, passed in 1986, requires those hospitals to provide \u201cstabilizing\u201d treatments for emergency room patients who are facing serious harm to their bodily functions. Congress enacted EMTALA to stop hospitals from turning away patients who could not afford their care. The law does not specify which procedures hospitals must perform to stabilize patients and Idaho accused the Biden administration of wrongly interpreting the Reagan-era law to \u201ccreate a nationwide abortion mandate in hospital emergency rooms.\u201d The state also argued that changes to the abortion law since its enactment meant doctors could adhere to EMTALA and the ban simultaneously. Idaho\u2019s law makes it a felony to perform an abortion, punishable by up to five years in prison. Doctors can also lose their medical licenses. \u201cThe U.S. Supreme Court had the opportunity to be clear that the federal EMTALA law protects the right to abortion in an emergency in every state \u2026 and they chose not to,\u201d said Planned Parenthood Federation of America President and CEO Alexis McGill Johnson in a statement to CNN. Interpretation of \u2018unborn child\u2019 is left for another day At oral arguments on April 24, several members of the court\u2019s conservative majority expressed skepticism of the Biden administration\u2019s position, with some justices framing the case as a federal encroachment on state powers to regulate medicine. Republican-appointed justices also zeroed in on amendments Congress made to the federal law in 1989 that added language about a pregnant woman\u2019s \u201cunborn child\u201d to its protections. Idaho argued it was nonsensical that a law referencing protections for an unborn child would require hospitals to offer abortions. A dissent written by Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, embraced an argument put forward by Idaho and its supporters in their efforts to defend the state\u2019s strict ban on abortion. Alito said the law provided for the \u201cexpress protection of the unborn child.\u201c \u201cFar from requiring hospitals to perform abortions, EMTALA\u2019s text unambiguously demands that Medicare-funded hospitals protect the health of both a pregnant woman and her \u2018unborn child,\u2019\u201d Alito wrote. He later added that \u201cEMTALA obligates Medicare-funded hospitals to treat, not abort, an \u2018unborn child.\u2019\u201d Kagan, in parts of her concurrence that were joined by both Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Jackson, disagreed. She said three of the statute\u2019s four references to an \u201cunborn child\u201d have to do with how hospitals handle transfers of women in labor, and thus were not related to the types of emergency pregnancy complications at issue in this case. The fourth provision, Kagan wrote, \u201censures that a woman with no health risks of her own can demand emergency-room treatment if her fetus is in peril.\u201d She added, \u201cIt does not displace the hospital\u2019s duty to a woman whose life or health is in jeopardy, and who needs an abortion to stabilize her condition,\u201d Kagan said. Abortion rights advocates countered that that was not Congress\u2019 intent, and worried that the conservative Supreme Court would read fetal personhood into a federal statute for the first time ever. For now, it is unclear whether either interpretation is accepted by a majority of the high court. More major abortion case drama For the second time in two terms, the public learned of where the Supreme Court was headed in a major abortion case before the justices had formally handed down their ruling, spoiling the court\u2019s highly controlled protocols around the release of opinions. On opinion days, the Supreme Court traditionally begins at 10 a.m. ET and reads any opinions it will release in order in terms of seniority \u2014 from most-junior to most-senior. Any per curiam opinions \u2014 majority decisions that are unsigned \u2014 would be at the end. They are announced from the bench and simultaneously handed out to reporters in the press room in print and posted online. The difference Wednesday was that the opinion was mistakenly posted online and it wasn\u2019t announced from the bench and printed copies were not present. The decision came days after the Supreme Court unanimously rejected an effort by anti-abortion groups to limit access to the abortion pill mifepristone. The court ruled that the groups that challenged access to the drug did not have standing to sue, a technical decision that does not foreclose the possibility that others might.

Last week, Trump\u2019s lawyers asked New York Judge Arthur Engoron \u2013 who ordered the presumptive Republican presidential nominee to pay nearly half a billion dollars in a judgment earlier this year \u2013 to recuse himself from the case, alleging the judge engaged in \u201cprohibited communications\u201d with lawyer\u00a0Adam Bailey before issuing his decision. Trump\u2019s attorneys said if Engoron\u00a0would not recuse from the case they are seeking an evidentiary hearing to delve into the judge\u2019s reported conversation with Bailey. The attorney general\u2019s office opposed the recusal motion in a new filing Wednesday, writing that the factual basis for the request was \u201cpure sophistry.\u201d \u201cTheir motion springs from, and rests exclusively on, a single NBC News article about a lawyer with no involvement in this case purportedly mentioning to the Court during an impromptu encounter in the hallway of the courthouse his thoughts about New York\u2019s business fraud statute,\u201d the attorney general\u2019s office said. The AG\u2019s office added, \u201cEven assuming that the encounter occurred as reported secondhand by NBC News, it was not an \u2018ex parte communication\u2019 because it was not specifically about this case but rather an abstract comment on the law.\u201d In their filings last week, Trump\u2019s attorneys\u00a0cited Bailey\u2019s interview\u00a0with NBC\u00a0New York\u00a0the day the verdict against Trump was rendered in February, in which\u00a0Bailey\u00a0said, he \u201chad the ability to speak to [this Court] three weeks ago \u2026 I saw him in the corner [at the courthouse] and I told my client, \u2018I need to go.\u2019 And I walked over and we started talking \u2026 I wanted him to know what I think [about the case] and why \u2026 I really want him to get it right.\u201d A lawyer for Bailey on Tuesday asked Engoron to block a subpoena from\u00a0Trump\u00a0tied to the former president\u2019s recent move to get the judge off the case. In a filing, Bailey accused\u00a0Trump\u2019s\u00a0lawyers of mounting a fishing expedition in their subpoena for \u201ccommunications and documents relating to communications between [Bailey] and the Hon. Arthur F.\u00a0Engoron, J.S.C., or any member of the Court\u2019s Staff.\u201d The real estate attorney told CNN last week that he only spoke with\u00a0Engoron\u00a0about his September summary judgment decision \u201cbecause that\u2019s the only thing I discussed with reporters.\u201d In February, Engoron found Trump, his adult sons and company were liable for fraud, returning a $454 million verdict. Trump\u2019s appeal of the verdict is pending, and Engoron\u00a0is still overseeing a monitor who he put in place to oversee the Trump Organization\u2019s finances.

{"id": "2024_06_20_politics_colin-allred-border-texas-senate-race", "text": "Democratic Rep. Colin Allred of Texas, who\u2019s challenging GOP Sen. Ted Cruz in the Republican-leaning state this fall, is promising to \u201cfix the border\u201d in a new ad, declaring that he \u201cstood up to Joe Biden on the border.\u201d But just two years ago, the congressman dismissed the issue as one playing out in the \u201cright-wing echo chamber,\u201d despite a sharp increase of migrants at the US-Mexico border at the time. Allred, a former NFL player and civil rights attorney who represents the northeast Dallas area, made his comments in February 2022 as the US was seeing a surge in migrants at the border compared with during the Trump administration \u2013 and even compared with the previous year under Biden, which smashed past records of encounters at the border. Asked about Republicans running on the border \u2013 along with crime, inflation and \u201cwokeism\u201d in the 2022 midterms \u2013 Allred said he thought most voters were focused on inflation and the economy. \u201cI think some of those others may fall into, kind of, the right-wing echo chamber,\u201d Allred told CBS News\u2019 Major Garrett on \u201cThe Takeout\u201d podcast. \u201cI don\u2019t hear a lot about the border here in Dallas, and I\u2019m in a border state. Obviously, we want to have comprehensive immigration reform. We want to try and, you know, address some of these things,\u201d Allred said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not \u2013 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a top-of-mind issue,\u201d he added, going on to say that he believed voters were still frustrated about Covid-19. In February 2022, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded 166,010 encounters with migrants at the US-Mexico border, reflecting a significant increase from the 101,099 encounters in the same month the previous year \u2013 a rise of 64%. That surge was part of a larger trend in 2022, which saw a then-record 2.4 million migrant encounters \u2013 a huge increase compared with during the Trump administration, which saw its highest annual total enforcement actions in fiscal year 2019 with 1.15 million. By comparison, fiscal year 2021, which covered part of Biden\u2019s first year in office, saw 1.95 million total enforcement actions. Though Allred dismissed the political importance of the border at the time, a University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll from June 2021 found that 34% of Texas voters identified immigration and border security, combined, as the biggest concerns for the state (each at 17%) \u2013 ahead of Covid at just 5%. Today, border issues are an even greater concern for Texas voters. A University of Texas/Texas Politics Project poll in April found a significant majority of Texas voters described migrants crossing the US-Mexico border as a crisis (48%) or a very serious problem but not a crisis (23%). In his race to unseat Cruz, Allred is now spending at least $380,000 running an online ad exclusively dedicated to the border issue. Allred did not publicly announce the ad, as he has done for previous ads. \u201cI\u2019m Colin Allred. Fentanyl is flooding into our country. Our border is broken, and so are our politics. To fix it, we have to go after the cartels and fix the border,\u201d Allred says in the ad. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to do it in a way that upholds our values. Values passed down from my grandfather \u2013 a customs officer in Brownsville. I stood up to Joe Biden on the border and to extremists like Ted Cruz, who prefer chaos to real solutions. I\u2019m Colin Allred. I\u2019m running for Senate to fix this problem.\u201d The ad is running online, where Google ad transparency data shows that Allred has spent at least $280,000 promoting two versions of the spot that run 30 and 15 seconds \u2013 and have been shown more than 11 million times. On Facebook, Allred has spent more than $100,000 running the ad. In a statement to CNN, Allred campaign spokesperson Josh Stewart said: \u201cSince his first days in Congress, Congressman Allred has focused on bipartisan solutions to fix our broken immigration system and secure our border. During his 12 years in the Senate, Ted Cruz has shown that he only wants to play politics with the crisis at the border and that he will never be part of a bipartisan solution.\u201d A shift on the border Allred \u2013 who was first elected to Congress in 2018 by flipping a GOP-held seat in the Dallas suburbs \u2013 has sought to toughen many of his stances on the border and immigration enforcement ahead of the statewide election in November. He joined a Democratic-led border security task force this spring and said he supported the border security bill introduced earlier this year that was killed by\u00a0Republicans. That bill did not contain provisions for any undocumented immigrants, including a pathway to citizenship, which Allred has long pushed for, but he called it \u201ca much-needed step\u201d on immigration reform. Allred has also shifted his rhetoric on a border wall popularized by Trump. At a January 2018 town hall, when he was running to unseat GOP Rep. Pete Sessions, Allred pledged to personally tear down the wall if it was enacted instead of creating a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented. \u201cThis idea that we\u2019re going to trade this for a racist wall. Absolutely not. If they build that wall, I will be there tearing it down,\u201d he said. He would repeatedly refer to the border wall as \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cwasteful, ineffective\u201d and a \u201cfailed policy\u201d that was not needed over the next few years, though he said in 2019 that physical barriers were \u201csometimes appropriate.\u201d Years later, in October 2023, after the Biden administration announced construction of new sections of the wall at the US-Mexico border, using funds already allocated during the Trump administration, Allred praised the decision. \u201cThis is a necessary step to help Texas\u2019 overwhelmed border communities deal with this current surge of migrants,\u201d he told The Hill, adding that it was \u201conly a partial solution.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/politics/colin-allred-border-texas-senate-race/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_politics_kemp-trump-georgia-vote", "text": "Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp revealed\u00a0Wednesday that he didn\u2019t vote for former President Donald Trump in the state\u2019s GOP primary in March. \u201cI didn\u2019t vote for anybody. I voted, but I didn\u2019t vote for anybody,\u201d Kemp told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins on \u201cThe Source\u201d the day before the historic presidential debate in his home state.\u201dI mean, the race was already over when the primary got here,\u201d he continued, later adding, \u201cI always try to go vote and, you know, play a part in it, but look at that point, it didn\u2019t really matter.\u201d Despite not voting for Trump in the primary, Kemp has maintained that he\u2019ll \u201csupport the ticket\u201d in November when Trump is set to face the presumptive Democratic nominee President Joe Biden. \u201cHe was the presumptive nominee before the primary ever got here. I mean, I didn\u2019t support anybody in the race,\u201d Kemp told Collins of Trump. \u201cI was thinking about it but, you know, just because a lot of circumstances and the way things played out, didn\u2019t end up doing that, but said all along for the most part that I would support the ticket, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve always done and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing this November.\u201d Kemp had previously told reporters in March that he would support the GOP\u2019s nominee in the general election, though he did not specify at the time\u00a0whether he voted for Trump in the Republican primary. The governor\u2019s comments came on the eve of the first presidential debate, hosted by CNN, between Trump and Biden. He urged the former president, with whom he has a contentious past, to focus on the future \u2013 and not risk swing voters\u2019 support \u2013 when he takes the podium in Atlanta. \u201cTrump has a great opportunity to really be forward thinking. Not look in the rearview mirror, not focused on the past, but stay focused on the future contrast,\u201d Kemp said. In the 2020 election, Trump lost the state of Georgia to Biden by over 11,000 votes. Biden became the first Democrat to win Georgia since former President Bill Clinton in 1992. Kemp has clashed with the former president after he refused to call a special legislative session to help Trump as he sought\u00a0overturn the 2020 presidential election results in Georgia. Trump was so furious with Kemp, he pledged to end his political career and backed a primary challenger in the 2022 Republican gubernatorial primary. The move failed spectacularly and Kemp beat David Perdue by over 50 points. While he said he hasn\u2019t spoken with Trump directly and said there\u2019s been no outreach from his campaign, Kemp suggested he could overlook the pair\u2019s contentious history to advance Republican causes. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how the race plays out and what they might ask for or need. But, I mean, like right now I\u2019m focused on turning the ticket out so we win. I mean, regardless of, you know, our history together, I have a vested interest in Georgia remaining in Republican hands,\u201d Kemp said. Asked whether he was concerned that Trump would again try to overturn the election, Kemp said he is \u201cvery confident\u201d democracy would hold. \u201cI don\u2019t worry about the institutions of democracy too much \u2013 they held up under a lot of pressure,\u201d he said. \u201cDemocracy has been bent and challenged in this republic in the past and it will be in the future.

{"id": "2024_06_27_politics_pentagon-usaid-temporary-gaza-pier-oversight-reviews", "text": "The Pentagon and USAID Inspectors General have launched coordinated reviews of the US humanitarian mission to Gaza where the military\u2019s temporary\u00a0pier has faced repeated challenges, including breaking apart and\u00a0the distribution of aid\u00a0being paused by the UN due to security concerns on the ground. The Defense Department IG will look specifically at the \u201ceffectiveness of DoD\u2019s efforts to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza through the maritime corridor,\u201d a\u00a0press release\u00a0on Thursday, announcing the effort, said. The USAID IG will look at the agency\u2019s \u201cplans and controls\u201d over the distribution of aid from the pier, and particularly the handoff of aid from the pier to the World Food Programme. The pier \u2014\u00a0called the Joint Logistics Over The Shore, or JLOTS \u2014 was first established on the Gaza coast in May. It has had to be re-anchored twice: once after it broke apart in heavy seas, a week after it was anchored for the first time, and again when it was disconnected intentionally in anticipation of more heavy seas. The review comes as some congressional Republicans have railed against the troubled pier as a \u201cwaste of taxpayer dollars\u201d that \u201cdefies all logic.\u201d On Wednesday, Rep. Mike Rogers, chair of the House Armed Services Committee, sent a letter to senior administration officials in which he said \u201cthe operation has been riddled with setbacks, sidelined more often than operational, and can only be classified as a gross waste of taxpayer dollars.\u201d Earlier this month, Sen. Roger Wicker, ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee was even more blunt. \u201cThis needs to end immediately,\u201d he said in a statement. WFP has had their distribution of aid from the pier paused for more than two weeks as they assess the security situation on the ground. CNN reported this week that there are more than 6,000 pallets of aid that have been delivered across the pier to the shore, awaiting distribution. Meanwhile, the humanitarian situation in Gaza has only grown more dire as the war between Israel and Hamas continues. A report this week from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) warned that the situation in Gaza \u201cremains catastrophic\u201d and that there is a \u201chigh and sustained risk of famine.\u201d \u201cThe last few months have demonstrated that food and humanitarian access and malnutrition prevalence can change very quickly, the risk of epidemics is increasing and eight months of extreme pressure on the lives of the population make them much more vulnerable to collapse into famine,\u201d the report said. US officials have said repeatedly that the pier is a temporary measure to get more aid to the desperate population of Gaza, and is not meant to replace land crossings which are critical to flow aid in. \u201cThe agreements between the DoD and USAID establish roles and responsibilities that help enable U.S. humanitarian assistance to reach Gaza through the maritime corridor,\u201d DoD Inspector General Robert P. Storch said in Thursday\u2019s release. \u201cGiven this, the DoD OIG and USAID OIG are working together to address the challenges associated with this mission. Through our collaboration, we will leverage the unique expertise, resources, and capabilities of our teams to optimize our oversight in this important area.\u201d USAID Inspector General Paul K. Martin said in the release that Congress \u201cand the American people can rely on USAID OIG to conduct independent and aggressive oversight of USAID-funded humanitarian assistance programming in Gaza.\u201d \u201cThis initial review, in coordination with DoD OIG, will provide timely insight and transparency over the delivery of assistance via the maritime corridor,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/politics/pentagon-usaid-temporary-gaza-pier-oversight-reviews/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_politics_trump-biden-debate-expectations-analysis", "text": "After months lampooning President Joe Biden as a cognitively impaired \u201cbrain-dead zombie\u201d who can\u2019t finish a sentence or navigate off a stage, former President Donald Trump and his campaign are changing their tune days ahead of the critical debate of the election. The commander in chief has suddenly morphed into a \u201cworthy debater,\u201d someone of considerable ability and a veteran political performer who is not to be underestimated, according to Trump and his lieutenants. The game of pre-debate expectation-setting is often absurd \u2013 one aide to former President George W. Bush once claimed that John Kerry, his Democratic opponent in 2004, was a better debater than Roman rhetorician Cicero. But the Trump team\u2019s shift is remarkable given their relentless assault on Biden\u2019s faculties. And it hints at their possible concerns that they\u2019ve set an unnecessarily low bar for the president\u2019s performance ahead of Thursday\u2019s clash hosted by CNN in Atlanta. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a possible Trump vice presidential pick, tried to reset the balance on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday. \u201cThe guy\u2019s run for office more than a dozen times. He\u2019s run for president four times. He\u2019s been campaigning since President Nixon was in office,\u201d he said. \u201cThis guy has got the ability.\u201d Trump is also hedging against a stronger-than-expected Biden showing by suggesting his opponent will be \u201cjacked up\u201d on drugs to ensure a strong performance. The Biden campaign, meanwhile, is intensifying its new attempt to portray Trump as an \u201cunhinged\u201d criminal who is morally reprobate, out to benefit his rich friends and unfit for a return to the Oval Office. The president\u2019s campaign, which is marking the second anniversary of Roe v. Wade\u2019s reversal this week and making abortion a key election issue, promised in a memo Sunday that the head-to-head would finally show voters the contrast Biden believes will disqualify Trump. \u201cThursday\u2019s debate will be one of the first moments of this presidential campaign where a larger slice of the American electorate will have the opportunity to witness the stark choice between Joe Biden, who is fighting for the American people, and Donald Trump, who is fighting for himself as a convicted felon with an unhinged campaign of revenge and retribution,\u201d campaign communications director Michael Tyler wrote. A moment that could define the campaign \u2013 and America\u2019s future The outlandish claims and pregame spin reflect the vital importance of the debate, with the rematch between Biden and Trump neck-and-neck just over four months from Election Day. The showdown comes amid bitterness between the rivals, especially in the wake of Trump falsely claiming that he won the 2020 election. The shadow of Trump\u2019s criminal conviction \u2013 and his sentencing in New York next month \u2013 is adding an extra level of tension at a time when the ex-president is threatening to use a second term to exact revenge against his enemies and as Biden warns Trump will destroy democracy. Trump\u2019s use of his weekend events as warm-ups contrasts with Biden\u2019s measured approach. The president is sequestered at Camp David in Maryland with a large team of aides and debate experts preparing for a meeting with Trump that could define his reelection bid. Millions of voters on Thursday will have a chance to assess the energy, endurance and mental sharpness of an 81-year-old president who has visibly aged and slowed in office as polls show most Americans think he\u2019s too old to serve another term. Fewer voters worry about the cognitive health of Trump, who is only three years younger at 78. But the ex-president\u2019s brash behavior, attacks on the judicial system and facts, and admiration for foreign dictators, which delight his supporters, often alienate swing-state suburban voters who are likely to decide the next president. But the debate cuts deeper than personalities. Voters hurting from years of high prices and craving the return to the full pre-pandemic normality that Biden promised four years ago will be waiting to hear how the candidates can ease the economic pressure bearing down on their families. Biden\u2019s campaign is signaling he will present himself as a force of stability addressing the needs of families that contrasts with Trump\u2019s \u201cdark vision\u201d and the GOP\u2019s threats to abortion rights. The ex-president is, meanwhile, lambasting Biden as blind to a southern border crisis and what he claims are cities scarred by crime, while trying to conjure nostalgia for the Trump economy before the Covid-19 crash. Trump\u2019s change of tone Trump appeared in Washington, DC, at a conference of Christian conservatives on Saturday before heading to Philadelphia, seeking to seize back a state Biden won in 2020 and without which either man may struggle to get to 270 electoral votes. He mocked Biden for going to a \u201clog cabin to study, prepare\u201d and claimed the president was sleeping at Camp David \u201cbecause they want to get him good and strong, so a little before debate time he gets a shot in the a**.\u201d Trump added:\u00a0\u201cI say he\u2019ll come out all jacked up, right?\u201d The presumptive GOP nominee\u2019s suggestions of chemical intervention mirrored his response to Biden\u2019s barnstorming State of the Union address earlier this year when a fired-up president make a mockery of conservative media expectations that he\u2019d stumble during the speech and instead countered their narrative of mental decline. Trump tempered earlier assessments of Biden\u2019s likely performance in an interview with the \u201cAll-In Podcast\u201d released Thursday. \u201cHe beat Paul Ryan,\u201d Trump said, referring to the vice presidential debate in 2012 when Biden dispatched Republican nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s running mate. \u201cI\u2019m not underestimating him,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI assume he\u2019s going to be somebody that will be a worthy debater.\u201d Burgum also sought to manage expectations on \u201cState of the Union\u201d in a way that appeared to undercut the Trump campaign\u2019s long-held position that Biden is no longer fit to serve as president. \u201cWhen he needs to, he can step up,\u201d he told Kaitlan Collins. \u201cThis guy has got the ability \u2013 and we\u2019ve seen it, we\u2019ve seen him in debate four years ago. We\u2019ve seen him in the State of the Union this year \u2013 that when he needs to, he can step up.\u201d Burgum\u2019s assessment is inconsistent with the ex-president\u2019s portrayal of his rival in even some of his most recent appearances. In the key battleground state of Wisconsin last week, for instance, Trump said of Biden: \u201cHe can\u2019t find his way off a stage ever.\u201d After conservative media highlighted deceptively edited video of Biden at the G7 summit in Italy this month, Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt accused the president of \u201cwandering around like a brain-dead zombie\u201d and of putting \u201ccognitive decline on full display.\u201d CNN senior political commentator David Axelrod said on \u201cState of the Union\u201d that the Trump campaign\u2019s reversal had been \u201cfun to watch.\u201d He noted Trump spent the last five years \u201cdescribing Biden as utterly incompetent, to the point where, if Biden arrives and leaves under his own power, that would be a triumph. \u2026 I think they have recognized in the last couple of weeks, \u2018Whoa, this guy is going to exceed those expectations and we\u2019d better start creating a rationale for him having a decent night.\u2019\u201d \u2018A magnifying glass on the choice\u2019 The former president has insisted he won\u2019t be participating in mock debates, though he has held what were described as policy forums with Republicans, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, another potential vice presidential contender. There is growing speculation about Trump\u2019s approach after his hyper-aggressive and angry performance in the first debate against Biden in 2020 backfired. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem had some advice for the ex-president on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. \u201cI don\u2019t think he has to get personal in this debate at all because he\u2019s going to have so many good things to talk about, in contrast with Joe Biden\u2019s policies,\u201d she said. Unlike Trump, who spent the weekend creating headlines, Biden hunkered down at the presidential retreat in Catoctin Mountain Park north of Washington. At his side were former White House chief of staff Ron Klain, who has been prepping Democrats for presidential debates for a generation, and other long-term loyalists including Mike Donilon, Bruce Reed, Anita Dunn and Steve Ricchetti. Former Obama White House counsel and Biden\u2019s personal attorney, Bob Bauer, who sources said was likely to reprise his role playing Trump in debate prep, was also on hand. In its memo, the Biden campaign said that Team Biden-Harris is putting a \u201cmagnifying glass on the choice this week as Democrats in Atlanta and across the country organize around this moment.\u201d The comparison on show even before the debate epitomizes the rivals\u2019 opposite approaches to the presidency. Trump is public, abrasive, profane and as ever flouting the expectations of traditional statesmanship. Biden is conventional, cautious and seeking to restore the norms that Trump once trashed.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/politics/trump-biden-debate-expectations-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_politics_biden-trump-character-attacks", "text": "Joe Biden is throwing everything at Donald Trump. The president and his campaign are blasting the presumptive Republican nominee as a criminal and a racist who was found liable for sexual assault and who is now being driven so \u201ccrazy\u201d by his loss in 2020 that he\u2019s been left \u201cunhinged.\u201d It\u2019s one of the most\u00a0searing portrayals in the modern age by an incumbent president of his challenger and is designed to define the 45th president as flagrantly unfit for a return to the office he left in disgrace in 2021. With his two impeachments, a criminal conviction and an attempt to overturn the last election, Trump gave Biden plenty to work with. But Biden\u2019s strategy may also tell the story of a reelection campaign that is going nowhere near as well as the president must have hoped, as he battles diminished standing across swathes of the electorate and faces a dauntingly narrow path to the 270 electoral voters needed to win in November. New fundraising figures announced by Biden and the Democratic Party on Thursday reveal that Trump and his team outraised the president for the second month in a row, largely erasing what was a financial advantage held by Biden for much of the campaign cycle. For months, Biden\u2019s team has argued that when the choice between the president and his predecessor became clear to voters, the stakes of the election would shift the political equation in his favor. The theory was that voters were slow to tune into the race and that they may need reminding about the chaos and the discord of Trump\u2019s first term that ended in the worst assault on democracy in generations. But it\u2019s now midsummer, and the election is less than five months away. There\u2019s every sign the race is still shaping up as much as a referendum on Biden \u2013 and a weary populace\u2019s lost sense of economic security \u2013 as it is on the threat to the rule of law that Trump is making clear a second term would entail. The president\u2019s campaign is therefore intensifying an effort to highlight the perceived consequences of a new White House mandate for Trump, who has pledged to use presidential power to exact personal retribution, while conservative groups polish blueprints for an overhaul of the bureaucracy, energy, and economic policy. Biden\u2019s best chance to reset the choice comes in his first debate with Trump on CNN in six days \u2014 a confrontation that the Biden campaign is trying to shape with daily attacks on Trump, looking to appeal to demographic groups the president hopes will return him to the White House. Some small shifts toward the president have emerged in some polling since Trump\u2019s criminal conviction in his hush money in New York last month. But the race has been mostly stable with no clear leader for months, which should be troubling to a president who is asking voters to reward him with a new term. Biden\u2019s best chance for a reset Thursday\u2019s debate will also represent the president\u2019s opportunity before tens of millions of television viewers to counter the bleak character sketch Trump is conjuring of him. The ex-president portrays his rival as a doddering incompetent who can\u2019t make it to the end of a sentence. This picture is exaggerated. But polls show that most Americans worry about the age and capacity of a president who has noticeably slowed physically in recent years and who would be 86 by the end of a second term. Trump isn\u2019t much younger, and if he wins, he\u2019d be the oldest president, at 78, to begin a second term. Biden has been road testing his character attacks on Trump for weeks in fundraising events and they\u2019re now increasingly being parroted by campaign officials. At a fundraiser attended by former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in northern Virginia on Tuesday, Biden laid out a stark scenario that included a warning that his rival was waging an all-out assault on the legal system. \u201cThe threat Trump poses would be greater in a second term than it was in his first term.\u00a0You know \u2026 I think he\u00a0snapped\u00a0when he lost in 2020.\u00a0He can\u2019t accept he lost.\u00a0(It\u2019s) literally driving him crazy. \u2026 He\u2019s not only obsessed with losing in 2020, he\u2019s clearly a little bit unhinged right now.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign has been seizing the initiative all week as it lays the groundwork for the message it clearly hopes Americans will take away from the debate. On Monday, it debuted a hard-hitting new ad. \u201cThis election is between a convicted criminal who is only out for himself,\u201d the narrator says as the former president\u2019s mug shot splashes across the screen. \u201cAnd a president who is fighting for your family.\u201d The gambit erased any doubt over how Biden will seek to exploit a guilty verdict against Trump and his three other criminal indictments to which he\u2019s pleaded not guilty. The ex-president\u2019s campaign will respond by claiming Biden\u2019s strategy is proof of an attempt to weaponize the justice system against him. But since Trump\u2019s campaign is already spinning that narrative anyway, Biden may have little to lose. The ad, part of a $50 million ad buy in June online, on battleground state TV channels and on national cable, references the hush money trial and Trump\u2019s losses in a defamation suit to the writer E. Jean Carroll and a civil fraud trial. Captions laid over dark, monochrome photos of Trump at court read \u201cConvicted \u2014 34 Felonies\u201d; \u201cLiable for Sexual Assault\u201d; \u201cCommitted Financial Fraud.\u201d Then, the video flips into full color with a shot of a beaming Biden surrounded by workers while it touts his efforts to cut health care costs and take on corporations. The contrast could not be more striking, and the Biden campaign must hope that it at last begins to take root in voters\u2019 minds. \u201cThe people of America are going to very soon have a choice between Donald Trump, who wakes up every day thinking about himself, thinking about his billionaire friends and then thinks about how he\u2019s going to hurt people that he thinks have hurt him,\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign co-chair Mitch Landrieu said on CNN\u2019s \u201cInside Politics\u201d on Thursday. \u201cJoe Biden wakes up every day fighting for the American people, making sure that we\u2019re going to protect people\u2019s freedoms, protect democracy and lower costs,\u201d Landrieu told Manu Raju. Biden seeks to move the goalposts with ads during soccer tournament The Biden campaign is now making daily pitches to a significant corner of his coalition showing signs of stress. Wednesday, the Juneteenth holiday that commemorates the end of slavery in the US, saw a stinging attack on Trump, designed to thwart his attempt to make inroads with Black voters \u2013 a vital Democratic voting block. \u201cAfter a lifetime of racism and in honor of the holiday, the least Trump could do is give Black America a day off from his campaign\u2019s racist, empty pandering,\u201d Jasmine Harris, the campaign\u2019s director of Black media, said in a statement. \u201cBlack voters have had enough \u2013 and they\u2019re ready to put an end to Trump\u2019s candidacy.\u201d The campaign also sent around a list of the many race controversies precipitated by Trump during his lifetime, including his call for the execution of five Black youths over the sexual assault of a woman in Central Park, New York, who were later found to be wrongly convicted, and his long-running racist conspiracy theory about the birthplace of former President Barack Obama. During the 2020 election, CNN exit polls showed that Trump got around 12% of the votes of Black Americans. But some recent opinion polls suggest he\u2019s currently getting around 20%. That kind of performance in 2024 could squeeze Biden\u2019s margins in key swing states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, where he needs strong Black turnout in cities like Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee to counter Trump\u2019s strong advantage in more rural areas. On Thursday, the Biden campaign turned to Hispanic voters \u2014 another key voting bloc where polls suggest he is underperforming. His campaign laid a seven-figure bet on the Copa Am\u00e9rica \u2014 the international soccer tournament featuring Western hemisphere men\u2019s teams that Lionel Messi and his World Cup-winning Argentina team kicked off in Atlanta on Thursday night. A new ad featuring the president and slamming Trump will air during games over the next few weeks as Biden\u2019s campaign seeks to remind Latino voters about Trump\u2019s chaotic leadership during the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cFour years ago, we were shut down. Stadiums were empty. Trump failed us,\u201d a narrator says over images of empty stadiums, arguing that Biden reopened the country and created 15.6 million jobs. The ad then cuts to a shot of Biden in what looks like a sports bar as the soundtrack plays the \u201cGoalllllllllllllll!\u201d cry that South American commentators use when the ball hits the back of the net. According to an NBC News poll in February, Biden and Trump are tied among Latinos, a constituency that has traditionally voted for Democrats. But Biden won the critical demographic 65% to 32% in 2020, according to exit polls. Unless he can get somewhere near that percentage again, key swing states in the West like Arizona and Nevada could be out of his reach and even competitive states further east that he also won four years ago, like Georgia and Pennsylvania, where there are smaller Hispanic populations, could be at risk. Biden\u2019s character attacks on Trump represent his best attempt to remind Americans of the fateful nature of the choice they will face in November. Those hits would be remarkable enough if the presumptive GOP nominee were a neophyte candidate who could be easily defined by negative advertising. But most voters already know exactly who Trump is. So, the finely balanced contest poses a question with which Democrats might prefer not to wrestle: What if enough persuadable voters are fully familiar with Trump\u2019s past and remember the mayhem and division of his White House term \u2013 but still aren\u2019t ready to support Biden?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/politics/biden-trump-character-attacks/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_politics_italian-animation-company-north-korea-sanctions", "text": "An Italian animation company has agreed to pay the US Treasury Department $538,000 for \u201capparent violations\u201d of US sanctions against North Korea by doing business with a North Korean state-owned animation studio, the department said Wednesday. It\u2019s the first time Treasury has levied financial penalties related to sanctions on North Korea\u2019s movie and animation industry, which experts say has quietly done business with foreign companies for decades, bringing the isolated and nuclear-armed North Korean regime vital revenue. The Rome-based animation\u00a0firm\u00a0Mondo\u00a0TV,\u00a0S.p.a. sent wire transfers through US financial institutions to pay North Korea\u2019s flagship studio, known as SEK, about $538,000 for outsourced animation work between May 2019 and November 2021, Treasury said in a statement. To process the payments, SEK used \u201cthird-party companies\u201d in China and the US that had accounts at \u201cseveral\u201d US banks, according to Treasury. A department spokesperson declined to name the US banks. Matteo Corradi, the CEO of Mondo TV Group, declined to comment. Founded in 1985, Mondo has produced or distributed a number of popular cartoons in Italy, including an adventure\u00a0show called \u201cSandokan \u2013 The Two Tigers.\u201d While many companies unknowingly hire North Korean workers, Mondo executives were under no illusions over who they were dealing with, according to the Treasury Department. The outsourcing contract made explicit reference to North Korea, the department said.\u00a0And the business relationship between Mondo and SEK began in the 1990s, when Mondo started subcontracting animation work to SEK \u201cfor a variety of programming, including children\u2019s animation,\u201d the Treasury Department investigation found. Mondo even hosted SEK animators when they took trips to Italy for training provided by the Italian company, according to Treasury. As North Korean leader Kim Jong Un continues to flaunt his nuclear arsenal, US officials have gone to increasing lengths to\u00a0track and intercept the billions of dollars they say North Korean hackers and IT workers have stolen or surreptitiously earned abroad over the\u00a0past\u00a0several years. Mondo\u2019s use of the US financial system to send money to North Korea triggered the Treasury investigation and the threat of fines. CNN has requested comment from North Korea\u2019s diplomatic mission in London. \u201cIt\u2019s rather surprising that any European company would knowingly work with a North Korean company like this after 2013, much less believe transactions to designated third parties \u2014 especially in the US \u2014 would go unnoticed,\u201d Jenny Town, director of the Korea program at the Stimson Center think tank, told CNN, referring to United Nations sanctions imposed on North Korea in 2013. The settlement \u201cshould be a wake-up call to those who might think the sanctions regime is dead,\u201d Town said. Along with Russia, North Korea is among the most heavily sanctioned governments in the world.\u00a0But the North Korean animation industry has provided an important source of revenue for\u00a0Pyongyang, according to experts. A trove of animation sketches that researchers\u00a0found\u00a0on a North Korean computer server last year\u00a0suggests\u00a0that North Korean graphic designers may have helped produce work for US animation studios unbeknownst to those companies. Experts who analyzed the documents told CNN that workers in China may have also been involved in the outsourcing work.

{"id": "2024_06_27_politics_aileen-cannon-trump-mar-a-lago-search-warrant-hearing", "text": "Judge Aileen Cannon wants to hold additional hearings on Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to challenge key evidence in his classified documents case and will allow the former president\u2019s lawyers to question witnesses about the investigation and search of Mar-a-Lago. On Thursday, the Florida-based judge said in a new order that she wants more evidence about the language in the FBI\u00a0warrant used to seize classified records from Mar-a-Lago in 2022 and about grand jury testimony from Trump\u2019s former attorney, Evan Corcoran. Those issues were argued in hearings on Tuesday, but Cannon did not rule on the matters. The judge did not say when additional hearings would be held. Cannon has been widely criticized for dragging out the case over multiple hearings, and a prosecutor\u00a0at the hearing earlier this week told her he believed the Trump team was\u00a0trying to hijack\u00a0the\u00a0proceedings\u00a0as a way to spread conspiracies about the work of federal investigators on this case. In her 11-page order Thursday, Cannon\u00a0seemed to push back on her critics. \u201cThere is a difference between a resource-wasting and delay-producing \u2018mini-trial,\u2019 on the one hand, and an evidentiary hearing geared to adjudicating the contested factual and legal issues on a given pre-trial motion to suppress,\u201d Cannon wrote. Cannon said she would revisit\u00a0the language used in the search warrant to seize property from Mar-a-Lago two years ago and\u00a0the Justice Department\u2019s use of Corcoran\u2019s testimony\u00a0to bolster\u00a0the obstruction part of the case. The special counsel\u2019s office has strongly opposed the need for additional hearings\u00a0and Trump\u2019s attempts to cut out parts of the case. Those court proceedings, which would include witness testimony and evidence presentation, would happen before a trial. Cannon then would need to decide if evidence seized from Trump\u2019s\u00a0Florida estate\u00a0and Corcoran\u2019s grand jury testimony could be used at trial. Cannon has not set dates for the additional hearings yet. In her order, she laid out the next steps before more hearings can happen. \u201cThe parties can meaningfully confer beforehand on the scope and timing of the hearing, raising appropriate objections with the Court as necessary; the parties can (and will) file exhibit and witness lists as is customary in federal criminal suppression litigation; and the Special Counsel can request the Court to impose reasonable limitations on the evidence produced to ensure efficiency and control,\u201d the judge said. Trump\u2019s lawyers say they believe the wording used in the search warrant to authorize agents to seize \u201cnational defense information\u201d and \u201cPresidential Records\u201d wasn\u2019t specific enough, and Cannon agreed that there were \u201cambiguities.\u201d \u201cThe Court determines that some of the terms in that document do not carry \u2018generally understood meaning[s]\u2019 such that a law enforcement agent, without further clarification, would have known to identify such material as \u2018seizable\u2019 property,\u201d the judge wrote on Thursday. \u201cFurther factual development is warranted related to Defendant Trump\u2019s particularity challenge\u201d of the search warrant\u2019s language.\u201d Cannon denied Trump\u2019s request, however, for another hearing about\u00a0the validity of the court-approved warrant\u00a0to search several rooms at Mar-a-Lago. Trump\u2019s team is also testing a Washington, DC,\u00a0federal court\u2019s decision during the grand jury investigation to force Corcoran to share his conversations with Trump,\u00a0after finding\u00a0Trump\u00a0may have\u00a0misled his attorney while attempting to obstruct federal authorities from recovering classified records after his presidency. Cannon said she would look again at the use of Corcoran\u2019s notes and testimony about his former client. \u201cIt is the obligation of this Court to make factual findings afresh on the crime-fraud issue,\u201d Cannon wrote. \u201cAnd a standard means by which to make such findings\u00a0\u2014\u00a0as is customary in criminal suppression litigation\u00a0\u2014\u00a0is following an evidentiary hearing at which both sides can present evidence (documentary and testimonial, as applicable).\u201d In an order Thursday, Cannon also said she would allow one more filing from each party on the proposed gag order from the special counsel\u2019s office. During a hearing over the gag order Monday, Cannon told prosecutors there needed \u201cto be a factual connection between A and B,\u201d referring to the gap between Trump\u2019s comments and potential threats prosecutors have warned about. Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement that the case should be thrown out. \u201cHighly respected Judge Aileen Cannon has rightfully scheduled hearings on the un-Constitutional piercing of President Trump\u2019s attorney-client privilege and the illegal raid on Mar-a-Lago by Crooked Joe Biden\u2019s DOJ,\u201d Cheung said. \u201cThe entire documents case was a political sham from the very beginning and it should be thrown out entirely.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.

{"id": "2024_04_10_politics_trump-2017-tax-cuts-rich", "text": "Wealthy donors forked over a record $50.5 million at a recent fundraising dinner for former President Donald Trump, but they could also reap big benefits if he returns to the White House. At the dinner, hosted by billionaire investor John Paulson, Trump told the crowd that one of his core issues for a second term would be extending the sweeping tax cuts that congressional Republicans approved in 2017. While the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced taxes for most Americans, the rich benefited far more than others. The speech outlined yet another divide between Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, and President Joe Biden, who is campaigning on raising taxes on the wealthy to fund his social and other priorities while protecting those who earn less than $400,000 a year from tax hikes. Biden\u2019s campaign wasted little time attacking Trump for \u201cpromising tax giveaways to billionaire donors.\u201d \u201cNow, Trump is making it clear to his billionaire buddies that he\u2019ll take his first chance to double down on tax giveaways for the ultra-wealthy \u2013 all while he fights to rip away Americans\u2019 health care, gut Social Security and Medicare, and raise costs on working families,\u201d Sarafina Chitika, a Biden campaign spokesperson, said in a statement. The fate of the 2017 law\u2019s individual tax provisions, which are set to expire at the end of next year, will depend on which party wins control of the White House and Congress in November. More than 60% of the benefits were expected to go to those whose incomes are in the top 20%, according to a 2018 analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan research group. More than 40% of the benefits were expected to go to those in the top 5%. Those making between $500,000 and $1 million were expected to get an average tax cut of about $21,000, lifting their after-tax incomes by 4.3%, according to the center\u2019s estimates. Those who earn $1 million or more would enjoy an average tax cut of about $70,000, raising their after-tax incomes by 3.3%. Only a little more than a quarter of those in the lowest-income households would see their taxes reduced. Their tax cut would be about $200, on average. However, most would see little or no benefit. If the tax cuts are extended, the pattern of who benefits is likely to be similar, according to the center. The wealthy have already been served well by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which also included multiple corporate tax changes. \u201cMost everybody in every income group got a tax cut, but the highest-income people got by far the biggest tax cut,\u201d said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the center. The law reduced individual and corporate income tax rates, repealed personal exemptions, increased the standard deduction and child tax credit, limited or restricted certain itemized deductions and doubled the estate tax exemption, among other provisions.

{"id": "2024_06_26_politics_what-the-supreme-court-ruling-on-social-media-means", "text": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday issued a decision that could have enormous consequences for the 2024 election, saying the US government can \u2013 for now \u2013 keep warning social media companies about mis- and disinformation threats it\u2019s seeing online. Although the case was decided narrowly on a technicality and not on the substance of the issues, the decision is nonetheless among the most consequential of the court\u2019s current term. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about this critical case affecting online speech and the democratic process. What can the US government tell social media companies to do? As a result of Wednesday\u2019s ruling in Murthy v. Missouri, agencies such as the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security will continue to be able to contact social media companies about posts they view as mis- and disinformation. Examples could include false claims about Covid-19, unfounded allegations about election fraud or other statements that in some situations may violate the platforms\u2019 own policies. Republican-led states, including Missouri and Louisiana, along with five social media users, claimed in 2022 that those contacts with social media companies were in fact part of an unconstitutional government campaign to silence free speech. The US government has been flagging this type of content to social media companies for years, at times using extremely forceful language to demand the content be removed. At oral arguments, justices spent more than 90 minutes trying to discern the line between government persuasion on one hand and undue government coercion on the other. Why is the government talking to social media companies? The government\u2019s outreach to social media platforms has been happening since the 2016 election and in direct response to Russia\u2019s attempts to meddle in US politics. In 2020, a congressional inquiry faulted the US government and tech platforms for not working together more to respond to those types of informational threats, which could baselessly sow division among voters and weaken the United States on the world stage. The ties between Washington and Silicon Valley involved routine, recurring meetings between government and company officials that were often publicly announced and included platforms such as Meta and Twitter (now known as X), as well as input by outside academics and researchers. Those lines of communication became important ways for the government and social media companies to trade information about fake accounts or malicious foreign actors looking to destabilize the United States, said Laura Edelson, an assistant professor of computer science at Northeastern University and the co-director of Cybersecurity for Democracy, a research group focused on digital misinformation. The relationships provided everyone involved with vital situational awareness about a rapidly evolving misinformation landscape, one whose danger has only grown with the advent of generative artificial intelligence, Edelson said. \u201cMoving into [this] election season, we\u2019ve already started to see influence campaigns starting to come out of the woodwork, be identified and reported on,\u201d Edelson said. \u201cThat\u2019s not news that those exist, and something that the government used to be a really good conduit for was making sure that when something was reported or identified in one platform, it was identified and shared with others.\u201d What does the Supreme Court think? The court said Wednesday that the plaintiffs in the case \u2013 the states and private citizens \u2013 didn\u2019t have the legal right, also known as standing, to bring their suit. Writing for a 6-3 majority, Justice Amy Coney Barrett said the plaintiffs didn\u2019t do enough to prove that it was government pressure on social media companies that directly led to their past posts being censored, let alone that the plaintiffs were in any imminent danger of the government somehow censoring their future posts. Social media sites clearly make their own decisions about how to moderate their platforms, regardless of what the US government may call for them to do, Barrett wrote. In fact, as evidence presented in the case showed, online platforms sometimes did the opposite of what the government wanted. \u201cThe platforms continued to exercise their independent judgment even after communications with the defendants began,\u201d Barrett wrote. \u201cFor example, on several occasions, various platforms explained that White House officials had flagged content that did not violate company policy.\u201d Barrett added: \u201cThe plaintiffs, without any concrete link between their injuries and the defendants\u2019 conduct, ask us to conduct a review of the years-long communications between dozens of federal officials, across different agencies, with different social-media platforms, about different topics.\u201d Rather than delve into all that, the court punted. It avoided ruling on whether the government\u2019s communications with social media companies violated the First Amendment.\u00a0But in so doing, the court didn\u2019t say that they were unconstitutional, either, which effectively means they can continue for now. This doesn\u2019t rule out a future set of plaintiffs bringing similar claims under a different set of circumstances, which could potentially allow the court to weigh in on the issue again, perhaps even on the merits of the matter. Legal experts said Wednesday that the court\u2019s decision carefully threads the needle. \u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision is a sensible response to a difficult question,\u201d said James Grimmelmann, professor of digital and information law at Cornell University. \u201cIt recognizes that platforms are free to set their own content-moderation policies against harmful and deceptive posts. It protects them from government coercion of their moderation decisions, but it also allows them to listen to the government\u2019s views.\u201d What does this mean for the 2024 elections? It is up to the Biden administration whether to fully revive the lines of communication it had temporarily paused during the litigation. The FBI resumed sharing some threat information with social media companies earlier this year, prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, CNN has previously reported. In light of Wednesday\u2019s ruling, however, the administration could potentially restore much more of its information-sharing infrastructure. \u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision is the right one, and it helps ensure the Biden administration can continue our important work with technology companies to protect the safety and security of the American people, after years of extreme and unfounded Republican attacks on public officials who engaged in critical work to keep Americans safe,\u201d White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement following the court\u2019s decision. Despite the ruling\u2019s narrow nature,\u00a0some legal experts said it is a significant win for those trying to ensure the 2024 race isn\u2019t disrupted by false claims. \u201cThere are essential moments when our government should be allowed, even encouraged, to contact private companies like social-media platforms and provide factual information to them, especially when issues of foreign interference, election integrity, national security and encouragement of violence crop up online and pose real-world threats,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel at the civil rights and consumer advocacy group Free Press. \u201cOf course, we should be wary of government intrusions into private speech,\u201d Benavidez added. \u201cBut the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to fight misinformation do not amount to censorship; rather, they are efforts to make platforms aware of the potential public harms that could result from the unvetted spread of falsehoods via their networks.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/politics/what-the-supreme-court-ruling-on-social-media-means/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_06_27_politics_what-to-watch-presidential-debate", "text": "President Joe Biden and his predecessor, Donald Trump, are set to make history on CNN Thursday night as they meet for their first 2024 debate. It\u2019ll be the first time a president and former president have ever debated. And it\u2019ll be the first time either man has been on a debate stage since their two clashes in 2020 \u2014 when Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic dominated the political landscape. Thursday\u2019s debate will be the earliest in the election cycle that a presidential debate featuring the major parties\u2019 nominees has\u00a0taken place in modern history. Now, Biden \u2014 already the oldest president the United States has ever had \u2014 has his own record to scrutinize. And Trump has a criminal record \u2014 including his conviction\u00a0in New York over falsifying business records related to hush money payments, two indictments stemming from his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, and\u00a0charges as a result of his handling of classified documents after leaving office. So does Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, who was convicted on gun charges and is frequently a target of Trump\u00a0and other Republicans. The debate is taking place about three miles from where Trump posed for the first mugshot taken of an ex-president after he was charged with trying to meddle in Georgia\u2019s 2020 vote count. The 90-minute debate is set to start at\u00a09\u00a0p.m. ET on CNN, with Jake Tapper and Dana Bash moderating. It will take place\u00a0at the network\u2019s studios\u00a0in Atlanta, and there will be no audience. Here are eight things to watch\u00a0for\u00a0in Thursday night\u2019s debate: What Trump focuses on: Biden\u2019s record or his grievances Those who haven\u2019t yet fully tuned into the 2024 presidential race might be surprised by how backward-looking the former president\u2019s most frequent riffs are. At campaign rallies and speeches at friendly right-wing gatherings, Trump devotes huge shares of his comments to personal grievances \u2014 rehashing long-debunked claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, recasting insurrectionists who stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, as patriots, and lambasting the criminal charges he faces\u00a0in\u00a0Washington, Florida and Georgia as political hit jobs. That litany of grievances might animate crowds of Trump supporters, but it\u2019s unlikely to convince a broader audience of voters who\u00a0may\u00a0consider backing him that he is focused on their interests. That\u2019s why Trump\u2019s advisers and allies have urged the former president to focus on issues like the economy, crime and inflation as he debates Biden. The lack of a studio audience may potentially help Trump,\u00a0who feeds on the reactions of his audiences, stay on track. How Biden seeks to answer the age question Every day the 81-year-old Biden wakes up as president, he sets a record as the oldest person to ever hold that position \u2014 and any misstep, meandering statement or lost thought on the debate stage will be heavily scrutinized or even distorted by allies of Trump, 78. Thursday will be Biden\u2019s first extensive exposure to millions of Americans since the last round of debates nearly four years ago, and the president will aim to avoid doing anything that could reinforce concerns about how old he is, while also turning the question of age into a statement on experience: Yes, he asks voters to put their faith in a person who would be 86 by the end of his second term, but he also enters the debate with more experience than anyone who has ever run for the presidency \u2014 and is able to use hard-earned knowledge to negotiate and pass bipartisan legislation. The best-case scenario for Biden is a repeat of his State of the Union address earlier this year: a forceful and clear delivery that shows the president confidently relaxed and able to effectively parry jabs from his opponent, assuaging age concerns and widening the gap in what so far has been an extremely tight race. The worst case?\u00a0He commits the kind of miscue that will cement Biden\u2019s age as a leading concern for voters all the way through Election Day. What Trump will say about abortion In 2016, Trump promised to take a light\u00a0touch\u00a0with abortion and reproductive rights. Many conservatives were skeptical he would seek to gut Roe v. Wade, while most liberals believed he would try his best to do just that. Eight years later, there is a similar dissonance across the political spectrum. Right-wingers who celebrated the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe are now occasionally frustrated by Trump\u2019s refusal to publicly double down and push for a national abortion ban. The left is certain that,\u00a0should\u00a0he be elected, Trump would embrace the most conservative possible position. What Trump says during the debate will be less interesting for its content than to whom he is seen appealing. It seems unlikely, but the former president could try to shore up his standing with the religious right by talking tough on the issue. More feasibly, he will deflect, attack Biden, and \u2013 at the most \u2013 talk up, as he\u2019s done on the trail, his Supreme Court nominees and say the issue is better left to the states. Part of the unpredictability here stems from how the GOP primary unfolded. Trump did not attend any debates and the candidates who did show up were mostly tight-lipped about an issue that, for all its salience among some conservatives, has provoked significant backlash against even the most moderate Republicans. Scrutiny over inflation under Biden Though inflation has slowed from its June 2022 peak, the cumulative effect of higher prices has long been a drag on Biden\u2019s approval rating. In interviews, Biden has largely downplayed the economic pinch many Americans say they feel, defending his administration\u2019s economic record. \u201cNo president\u2019s had the run we\u2019ve had in terms of creating jobs and bringing down inflation,\u201d he said in a May interview with CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett. Biden falsely claimed that inflation was 9% when he took office. In reality, inflation hit that peak more than 16 months into his term. A pro-Trump dark money group, Securing American Greatness, launched a TV ad in Georgia days before the debate accusing Biden of \u201cdenying reality\u201d on inflation. \u201cWhy won\u2019t Biden admit how bad things are?\u201d a narrator says in the ad. \u201cIs it dishonesty or dementia?\u201d Biden, though, has a readily available counter: Experts have said many of Trump\u2019s proposals \u2014 including steep tariffs, sharp immigration limits and measures that would give the president more power to lower interest rates \u2014 would worsen inflation. What Biden says about Trump and democracy In speeches and political appearances since the campaign began in earnest earlier this year, Biden has repeatedly said that he fears something integral to the American foundation is at stake if Trump regains the White House: democracy itself. \u201cNot since President Lincoln and the Civil War have freedom and democracy been under assault here at home as they are today,\u201d Biden said during his State of the Union address earlier this year. On Thursday, for the first time, Biden will have a chance to confront Trump to his face about his denial of the election\u00a0results that led to the events of\u00a0January 6, 2021, his kowtowing to Russia over US allies, and his stated promise to seek retribution for those who have wronged him politically. How Biden addresses Israel and Gaza It might not register as the top issue for voters in most polling, but the specter of Israel\u2019s ongoing offensive in Gaza has cast a shadow over Biden\u2019s campaign \u2013 specifically, his ability to revive the diverse, center-left coalition that led him to victory four years ago. That big tent is, today, full of people with vastly differing opinions on the conflict and the president\u2019s handling of the US relationship with Israel and its right-wing leader, Benjamin Netanyahu. Neither side of the domestic debate is inclined to compromise, which makes it pretty difficult to imagine Biden pleasing everyone to the left of Trump. The Biden campaign knows all this, of course, so it will be interesting \u2013 and instructive \u2013 to hear his message and analyze where it\u2019s being targeted. It is\u00a0difficult to predict what he will focus on\u00a0because of the other guy on the stage. Trump has, per usual, lobbed out a number of takes on the war and its political implications. Their opposition on foreign policy Trump\u2019s affinity for Russian President Vladimir Putin is hardly a secret. His views on US and NATO aid to Ukraine, which has been resisting a Russian invasion for\u00a0more than\u00a0two years, are slightly hard to pin down. What we do know, though, suggests a second Trump administration would be much more welcome in Moscow than Kyiv. Just days ago, Reuters reported that a pair of top Trump foreign policy advisers have drawn up a plan designed to, in theory, end the war by making lethal aid from the US contingent on Ukraine entering\u00a0into\u00a0peace talks with Putin. If Russia did not come to the table, in this framework, that support would be ratcheted up. Crucially, though, the ceasefire that would accompany the talks would freeze the conflict in place along its current fronts. The Trump campaign distanced itself, in part, from the plan, noting that the advisers who wrote it are not on the payroll. But the story resonated because it sounded a lot like something Trump might say or propose \u2013 especially given his opaque promises to end the war immediately if elected. Biden\u2019s worldview is different. He is strongly supportive of Ukraine and has spent immense political capital on getting the US Congress to greenlight military aid to Kyiv. He has also positioned himself at the forefront of liberal Western Europe, specifically NATO, which has done just about everything but send troops across the border. Their differences on the border and immigration Trump and Republicans have made the border a central campaign issue, and Trump has vowed to use the power of the federal government to \u201cremove known or suspected gang members, drug dealers, or cartel members from the United States.\u201d He\u2019s also had some more outlandish suggestions, including setting up a UFC migrant league. Biden\u2019s hot-and-cold immigration policies give the president plenty of room to demonstrate his approach as a compassionate one that aims to keep families together and careers and lives intact, but they also open him up to criticism from both flanks. Biden reversed or canceled some of Trump\u2019s hardline immigration policies immediately upon taking office, only to roll back some of those rollbacks when migrant numbers surged, border cities became overwhelmed and his approval ratings took a hit. He had crafted the most extensive bipartisan immigration reform package in years, only for Trump to kill it so he could campaign against Biden on the issue. He has issued executive actions both limiting migrant crossings and protecting some undocumented immigrants from deportation. Sources have told CNN that Biden is expected to go on the offensive on immigration \u2014 casting Trump\u2019s policies as extreme and his own as compassionate.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/politics/what-to-watch-presidential-debate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "politics"}}
