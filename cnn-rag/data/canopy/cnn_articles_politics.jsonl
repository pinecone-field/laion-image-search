{"id": "2024_05_11_politics_maryland-primary-angela-alsobrooks-david-trone", "text": "The farmers market in this suburb of Washington, DC, was a ripe crowd for Angela Alsobrooks, who\u2019s locked in an increasingly contentious Senate Democratic primary on Tuesday. \u201cI would really like to see a Black woman in the Senate. It\u2019s about time,\u201d 68-year-old Kathy Pruitt of Takoma Park said as she stood in the pickle line last Saturday. If elected in November, Alsobrooks, the executive of Prince George\u2019s County, could become only the third Black woman ever elected to the Senate. (The one Black woman currently serving \u2014 California\u2019s Laphonza Butler \u2014 was appointed and isn\u2019t running to stay beyond this year.) Alsobrooks would also add a woman to Maryland\u2019s 10-person congressional delegation, which is all male. First, though, she\u2019d have to defeat one of those men \u2014 Democratic Rep. David Trone, the co-owner of Total Wine & More, who has poured about $60 million of his own money into the election so far. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a tight race, and I think they both have a path to victory,\u201d said Mileah Kromer, who oversees the Goucher College Poll, noting the potential power of Alsobrooks\u2019 endorsements and Prince George\u2019s County base vs. Trone\u2019s enormous spending advantage. The race has divided Congress, with nearly all of the Maryland delegation backing Alsobrooks and key members of House Democratic leadership backing Trone. The eventual nominee will likely face off against former GOP Gov. Larry Hogan, whose popularity in the state could jeopardize Democrats\u2019 chances of holding the seat \u2014 and with them, the Senate majority. The potential history-making aspect of Alsobrooks\u2019 candidacy isn\u2019t her central pitch to voters, and many of her female supporters stressed that this isn\u2019t about identity politics. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t like everything else about her, it would not be enough,\u201d Pruitt said. And yet in a contest with few distinct policy differences between the candidates on big federal issues, Alsobrooks is making her lived experience a point of contrast with Trone \u2014 especially in a race where protecting abortion rights is a key part of the argument for keeping the seat in Democratic hands.\u00a0Trone is also pointing to the stakes of November, making an electability argument about having the resources to defeat Hogan. But here in Maryland, a state where Kromer estimates the Democratic primary electorate is about 40 to 45% Black, the primary isn\u2019t as simple as coalition politics vs. money. Trone, for example, has his own support from Black women, including some prominent local leaders from Alsobrooks\u2019 backyard who have appeared in his attack ads. Asked if electing a Black woman to the Senate mattered to her, one Prince George\u2019s County voter coming out of a Target in Bowie Monday night was frank. \u201cNot at this point. I, like, need a job done. There were times when it did. At this point, I\u2019m voting for whoever I think is going to do the best job,\u201d the 49-year-old French teacher said, noting that would not be Alsobrooks because she was disappointed with her record as county executive. \u201cI\u2019ve seen many buildings go up with nothing else,\u201d said the teacher, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution in the school system, which she said \u201chas crumbled.\u201d But in a hint of the challenges that lie ahead for Democrats, she paused after saying she was leaning toward Trone \u2014 noting that she \u201cwas very pleased with Hogan as a pandemic governor\u201d \u2014 then added, \u201cHowever, I have to look at the long term.\u201d A historic opportunity to elect a Black woman, but it\u2019s not a motivator for everyone The women who walked with Alsobrooks through the drizzle last Saturday \u2014 from her downtown Silver Spring campaign office to a local early voting location nearby, with a marching band alerting farmers market foragers along the way \u2014 easily rattled off their candidate\u2019s accomplishments for schools and the local economy before they talked about her being a woman. But it was an undeniable part of Alsobrooks\u2019 appeal \u2014 when she talks about her experience as a domestic violence prosecutor, for example, or when she or her allies attack her businessman opponent for having donated to GOP governors who have since signed abortion restrictions. (He\u2019s chalked those contributions up to business expenses and touted the millions he\u2019s donated to Democrats.) \u201cElecting women is not just good for Maryland,\u201d Alsobrooks told supporters assembled outside her campaign office. \u201cIt\u2019s good for America to make sure that the voices of women are included at these tables as we\u2019re making important decisions.\u201d Ellen Malcolm, the founder of EMILY\u2019s List \u2014 whose affiliated super PAC recently made a $2.5 million investment in the race \u2014 told the crowd, \u201cWe are going to make history again,\u201d noting how the powerhouse Democratic group burst onto the scene by helping elevate Maryland\u2019s Barbara Mikulski to the Senate in 1986. The former senator has backed Alsobrooks, as have the Washington Post, Gov. Wes Moore and every other Democratic member of the state\u2019s current congressional delegation, with the exceptions of one House member who backed Trone and of retiring Sen. Ben Cardin, who\u2019s remaining neutral in the race to replace him. Alsobrooks\u2019 allies are looking at this seat as an opportunity not only to maintain the status quo of one Black woman in the Senate, but also to potentially grow the ranks. After California Rep. Barbara Lee failed to advance to the November election, attention turned to Delaware, where Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester is running for an open Senate seat, and, now, to Maryland. Pamela Luckett, 67, of Silver Spring said Maryland should play a role in diversifying the chamber. \u201cAs a leader in democracy across the country, it\u2019s very important that we do that \u2014 with a qualified person,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about identity. She is qualified, and she is the most qualified candidate in that race.\u201d But experience \u2014 and whose is more relevant \u2014 has become a flashpoint that\u2019s also brought the conversation back to race. Trone, first elected to Congress in 2018, leans into his voting record and argues that he\u2019ll be able to get 10 Republicans to sign on to legislation in the Senate to overcome a filibuster. \u201cThat\u2019s what really matters is getting things accomplished, and not being beholden to any special interests,\u201d he said. His campaign has taken heat, however, for an attack ad in which a local lawmaker said the Senate \u201cis not a place for training wheels.\u201d More than 750 Black women leaders wrote a letter saying Trone\u2019s ads echo \u201ctones of misogyny and racism.\u201d \u201cThis attempt to undermine Ms. Alsobrooks\u2019 candidacy is deeply troubling and emblematic of the obstacles Black women face in political spheres,\u201d they wrote. That comment was edited from the ad, but Trone himself told a local NBC affiliate, \u201cThis job is not for someone on training wheels.\u201d Alsobrooks hasn\u2019t hesitated to call him out, trying to contrast their tones. \u201cThat kind of disparaging remark is what we\u2019ve seen too much of in Washington; people are sick of it,\u201d she told CNN last weekend. \u201cAnd it shows also what is in his mind \u2014 that he has a very low opinion of women.\u201d Asked about the \u201ctraining wheels\u201d comment by CNN Tuesday night, Trone denied he had said it, pinning the words on the local lawmaker, but added, \u201cFrankly, she doesn\u2019t have the experience at the federal level.\u201d And he has some powerful local Black women surrogates making that argument for him too. \u201cYou can\u2019t learn this stuff overnight \u2014 you got to know this stuff on Capitol Hill,\u201d state Sen. Joanne Benson told the crowd at a Women for Trone event in Bowie Monday. \u201cDo you understand the person who\u2019s going on Capitol Hill has to deal with the likes of Donald Trump?\u201d Speaker after speaker at the rally in Alsobrooks\u2019 home county praised Trone\u2019s hiring of formerly incarcerated people and his backing from the teachers union, for example. His record, many Black women here said, trumped any potential history Alsobrooks might make. \u201cIt\u2019s not that simple, because it matters what you believe,\u201d said Prince George\u2019s County councilmember Krystal Oriadha, who argued that playing identity politics was a GOP tactic her own party needed to beware of. \u201cThey elevate someone because they think because of identity politics, if you\u2019re a woman, or you\u2019re Black, you\u2019re gonna forget the issues and you\u2019re gonna be blind to if they actually align with what\u2019s best for your community.\u201d Self-funding, a badge of independence for some voters, turns off others Trone \u2014 who\u2019s also spent millions of his own money on his House campaigns \u2014 doesn\u2019t go around talking about how much he\u2019s spent, but his ability to self-fund is a big part of his pitch. \u201cWe know all the good things that need to happen often don\u2019t happen because of special interest money,\u201d he told an audience at the AFI Silver Theatre on Tuesday, arguing that he can stand up to the NRA and the pharmaceutical industry. \u201cNot accepting money from PACs, and special interests, I save about 30% of my time to have time instead to build connectivity,\u201d he added, touting his work across the aisle. Trone\u2019s supporters draw a distinction between his humble roots \u2014 he often talks about not having an indoor toilet when growing up \u2014 and politicians who have inherited their wealth. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear about this: He was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth,\u201d Benson told attendees at the Women for Trone rally, praising his rags-to-riches story and recounting how he\u2019d written a $10,000 check for a scholarship fund she wanted to set up for her late sister. Besides giving him an advertising and operational advantage, Trone also sees his money as a selling point to Democrats worried about holding this seat in November. Alsobrooks hasn\u2019t lacked resources \u2014 she had raised nearly $7.8 million by the end of the pre-primary reporting period on April 24. She\u2019s risen to the fundraising challenge that\u2019s often been a barrier to Black women in politics, said Glynda Carr, the president and CEO of Higher Heights for America, whose PAC works to elect Black women and is supporting Alsobrooks. \u201cThe new barriers, though, if you follow the data, are self-financed candidates,\u201d Carr said. But Alsobrooks\u2019 supporters point out that Trone\u2019s spending, while it has certainly gotten his message out, hasn\u2019t put the race away for him. And for some, his ability to fund is itself a turn-off. Back at the pickle stand, Pruitt said: \u201cWe don\u2019t need another millionaire, billionaire in the Senate.

{"id": "2024_05_11_politics_donald-trump-taxes-irs-report", "text": "Former President Donald Trump could owe more than $100 million in taxes as a result of a yearslong Internal Revenue Service inquiry into claims of huge losses on his Chicago skyscraper, The\u00a0New York Times and ProPublica\u00a0reported Saturday. The news organizations reported Trump claimed massive financial losses twice \u2014 first on his 2008 tax return, when he said the building, then mired in debt, was \u201cworthless,\u201d and again after 2010, when he had shifted its ownership into a new partnership also controlled by Trump. The 2008 claim resulted in Trump reporting losses as high as $651 million for the year, and there is no indication it drew an IRS challenge, the outlets reported. Then, Trump\u2019s lawyers enabled further claims of losses in 2010 by shifting the Chicago tower into another partnership, \u201cDJT Holdings LLC,\u201d The Times and ProPublica reported. In the years that followed, other Trump businesses, including golf courses, would be shifted into that same partnership \u2014 which his lawyers used as the basis to claim more tax-reducing losses from the Chicago tower. That move sparked the IRS inquiry. Those losses added up to $168 million over the next decade, the report said. The outlets calculated the revision sought by the IRS could result in a tax bill of more than $100 million. The only public mention of the IRS audit into Trump\u2019s Chicago tower loss claims came in a December 2022 congressional report that The Times and ProPublica reported made an unexplained reference to the section of tax law at issue in the case. That mention, the outlets reported, confirmed the audit was still underway. \u201cThis matter was settled years ago, only to be brought back to life once my father ran for office. We are confident in our position, which is supported by opinion letters from various tax experts, including the former general counsel of the IRS,\u201d Trump\u2019s son Eric Trump, the executive vice president of the Trump Organization, told The Times and ProPublica in a statement.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/politics/donald-trump-taxes-irs-report/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_politics_climate-trump-biden-what-matters", "text": "It is not news that former President Donald Trump wants to hit rewind on President Joe Biden\u2019s climate policy. What is news is how far Trump may go. There\u2019s new reporting in The Washington Post that Trump, during a meeting at Mar-a-Lago, asked oil executives to raise $1 billion for his campaign so that he could upend efforts by Biden to push the US toward clean energy and electric vehicles. While the transactional nature of the pitch, as relayed to the Post, is overt and somewhat shocking, it\u2019s not out of step with Trump\u2019s view of politics or his insistence that climate change is a \u201choax.\u201d For evidence that climate change is not a hoax, read this CNN story about ocean temperatures. Or look at the pictures of hundreds of thousands of dead fish killed by a heat wave in Vietnam. I talked to CNN climate reporter Ella Nilsen about Trump\u2019s plans for a second term and Biden\u2019s record on climate change. Among the interesting things  I learned is that a lot of the money Biden and Democrats have spent to spur manufacturing has gone to red states. What would climate policy look like under Trump? WOLF: The Washington Post reports that Trump is promising oil executives a friendly administration if they raise $1 billion for his campaign. Politico reports the oil industry is crafting executive orders Trump could sign on day one. Trump has promised \u2013 in his \u201cdictator for a day\u201d fantasy \u2013 to act on immigration and energy production first. What do we know about how different US energy policy would be under Trump? NILSEN: In his first term, Trump overturned more than 100 environmental rules and actions put in place by the Obama administration. Biden\u2019s administration has spent much of its tenure undoing Trump\u2019s actions \u2013 in some places enacting even stronger regulations on planet-warming pollution coming from\u00a0vehicles,\u00a0power plants and the\u00a0oil and gas\u00a0industry. Trump has vowed to again reverse course from Biden; he wants to give a boost to fossil fuels and oil and gas drilling in particular. A mixed view of Biden WOLF: For all their rhetorical differences on climate, it\u2019s not like the US has cut oil production under Biden. In fact, the US remains the No. 1 world oil producer by a long shot. How do climate activists rate the current administration? NILSEN: Climate activists have a mixed view of Biden. On the one hand, he delivered on the most\u00a0ambitious piece\u00a0of climate legislation in modern history. His administration has also finalized some pretty ambitious regulations cutting planet-warming pollution, conserved a lot of public lands and created an American Climate Corps \u2013 a key demand of activists. On the other hand, the administration greenlit\u00a0the massive new oil drilling project\u00a0in Alaska known as Willow, which galvanized a huge amount of opposition from youth climate groups and on social media. Youth climate groups want Biden\u00a0to use executive authority\u00a0to stop drilling for fossil fuels \u2013 something that likely won\u2019t happen as\u00a0oil and gas production booms\u00a0in the US. Are we seeing payoff for all that climate spending Democrats enacted under Biden? WOLF: The money for climate in the  Inflation Reduction Act, which was backed by Democrats only, was sold as the largest-ever investment in clean energy and climate policy. Are we seeing it pay off? NILSEN: Yes, so far. The IRA has already spurred hundreds of billions of dollars of investment in new US manufacturing, largely for clean-energy industries like EVs, battery plants, and solar and wind production. A lot of this funding has been clustered in red states, but other 2024 swing states like Michigan, Arizona and Georgia have been big benefactors. Why is the funding clustered in red states? WOLF: Is that a political move, or does it just have to do with the fact that it gets windy in Texas? NILSEN: You\u2019re right, it\u2019s very windy in a lot of red states \u2013 red states like Texas, Oklahoma, Iowa and South Dakota are big wind-energy producers and consumers. But there are other reasons too. For instance, it\u2019s easier to permit and build in some red states, and others have relaxed union labor laws, another factor that draws big businesses. A third of US emissions are from one sector WOLF: I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of stories about a backlash to EVs. Trump falsely says Biden wants to ban gas-powered vehicles. How big a part does a transition to EVs play in addressing climate change? NILSEN: The vehicles we drive play a huge role in addressing climate change. Transportation emissions account for a little less than a third of total US emissions \u2013 the biggest individual sector for greenhouse gas pollution. Even accounting for mining for the critical minerals needed for EV batteries, EVs\u00a0are much cleaner\u00a0than gas-powered vehicles \u2013 assuming the power used to charge them is also coming from clean sources. Can states pick up the slack if the federal government turns on climate policy? WOLF: Even before Biden took office, states like California were taking the lead in a more climate-focused energy policy. Would that continue even if Trump wins? NILSEN: Yes, blue states like California and Washington state and even some Midwestern, purple states like Michigan and Minnesota have passed some very ambitious climate laws through their legislatures. That work will continue in the states even if Trump is elected. But given how quickly we\u2019re running out of time to get the planet\u2019s warming under control, it will be important to have the federal government moving in that direction as well. What is happening in Congress? WOLF: Better than presidents taking executive action or the Environmental Protection Agency writing a regulation to address the climate would be lawmakers passing a major piece of climate legislation. Are there any indications of movement toward a new national energy policy? NILSEN: Lawmakers passing the IRA was a huge achievement in its own right; however, multiple lawmakers have said the IRA was just the start. Given the 2017 Trump tax cuts are expiring soon, and Congress will have to take up tax policy in 2025, there\u2019s already chatter about a possible carbon tax, or a carbon tariff on polluting products like cement and steel, coming up in the legislature. Of course, what\u2019s possible in Congress depends tremendously on which party is in power \u2013 and who is in the White House.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/politics/climate-trump-biden-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Barron Trump, who turned 18 in March,\u00a0had been selected\u00a0by the Florida GOP to serve as an at-large delegate at the July convention. Several other Trump family members \u2013 including\u00a0Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Tiffany Trump \u2013 were also selected as delegates.

Yang in Washington. \u201cSometimes they won\u2019t \u2013 and then you need to kick that f***ing door down,\u201d she added, to applause and laughter from the crowd. She added, \u201cExcuse my language,\u201d as the crowd continued to laugh and applaud. Harris\u2019 statement came as she marked Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, reflecting on her experience as the country\u2019s first female, first Black and first Asian American vice president. Harris told Yang that people should never use others\u2019 preconceptions of what they\u2019re capable of to limit their own dreams and desires. \u201cDon\u2019t ever carry, as a personal burden, your capacity to do whatever you dream and aspire to do based on other people\u2019s limited ability to see who can do what,\u201d Harris said. Harris this year has become a key figure for President Joe Biden\u2019s administration and campaign, criss-crossing the country making points that might be more difficult for the president \u2013 an older white man \u2013 to make himself. Her efforts have included serving as the administration\u2019s point person on abortion rights, becoming the first sitting president or vice president to visit an abortion provider and traveling to states such as Florida and Arizona, where new court rulings and laws have thrown into doubt the future of abortion access. Harris on Monday also discussed the administrations efforts to protect the legal right to an abortion, making references to the 2022 Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade. \u201cA decision has been made that takes from the American people a fundamental freedom to make decisions about one\u2019s own body,\u201d Harris told Yang. \u201cThink about what that\u2019s taking us back to, that one does not have the right to exercise authority over issues that I call heart and home, issues that are fundamental to what should be a right to decide to start a family or not.\u201d Harris also reflected on efforts to curb gun violence, expressing optimism that young voters, who have borne the brunt of gun violence in schools, will lead the charge in effecting change. \u201cWhen our young leaders start voting in their numbers on so many of these issues, I believe we are going to see a sea change in terms of how we address it, because our young leaders in particular are very practical and they want to see things done \u2013 and what I love about them is they\u2019re not gonna wait for us to figure it out, they\u2019re gonna do it,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/politics/kamala-harris-breaking-barriers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_politics_cnn-interview-joe-biden-what-matters", "text": "President Joe Biden sat down with CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on Wednesday for a rare, one-on-one television interview with a member of the national media. They talked in Wisconsin, where Biden is trying to highlight a plan to build up manufacturing and tech jobs in the Midwest. The interview also comes as Biden trails former President Donald Trump in multiple national and swing-state polls and as Biden\u2019s policy supporting Israel has driven a wedge between him and younger, progressive voters Democrats rely on. Here are some key lines from the interview: \u25ba On polling data that shows him trailing Trump on the economy and whether he is running out of time to turn around perceptions of the economy before Election Day: Biden pointed to polling he said suggests a majority of people were satisfied with their own situation. \u201cThey think the nation\u2019s not in good shape, but they\u2019re personally in good shape,\u201d Biden said. White House advisers have previously pointed to a University of Michigan survey that has shown a general uptick in consumer sentiment. Regarding inflation, he agreed that people feel day-to-day pain in the increased price of groceries and other items they need, but he argued it is more about anger than being unable to afford things. \u201cThey have the money to spend. It angers them and it angers me that they have to spend more,\u201d he argued, before talking about \u201ccorporate greed\u201d being responsible. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS and released in late April, a majority of Americans, 70%, said economic conditions in the US were poor, and there was similarly dismal approval of Biden\u2019s handling of the economy. On the subject of personal finances, CNN\u2019s polling director Jennifer Agiesta wrote: Americans\u2019 perceptions of their own finances also remain negative, with 53% saying they are dissatisfied with their personal financial situation while 47% are satisfied. Dissatisfaction is starkly prevalent among those with lower incomes (67% dissatisfied in households with annual incomes lower than $50,000), people of color (64% say they are dissatisfied) and younger Americans (61% of those younger than 45 say they are dissatisfied). \u25ba On why people should believe him on the economy rather than Trump: Biden was in Wisconsin to notch a win where a Trump plan failed. Trump, during his presidency, announced a deal to entice the Taiwanese company Foxconn to build up tech manufacturing jobs in the Midwest. That never came to be, and the Foxconn site in Racine, Wisconsin, was largely abandoned. Biden visited the area to announce a plan by Microsoft to build a data hub there to train workers on how best to use artificial intelligence. Biden\u2019s claim of 15 million jobs being created in the US during his administration is correct, but it lacks the context that so many jobs were temporarily lost during the Covid-19 pandemic. Biden later argued he was coming at the economy form \u201ca Scranton perspective\u201d while Trump was coming from \u201ca Mar-a-Lago perspective.\u201d \u25ba On how seriously he takes the threat that if Trump believes the election is not \u201chonest,\u201d the former president again won\u2019t accept the election results: \u201cThe guy is not a democrat with a small d,\u201d Biden said, suggesting Trump does not believe in democracy. He added that Trump, if reelected, has promised to use his attorney general to target certain people and to be his supporters\u2019 \u201cretribution.\u201d \u201cWhat president has ever said anything like this stuff?\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd he means it.\u201d Biden said the leaders of other democracies are rooting for him. \u201cEighty percent of them after we have a major meeting, they go, you have to win for my democracy to stick \u2013 their democracy to stick,\u201d Biden said. \u25ba On being called \u201cgenocide Joe\u201d at pro-Palestinian protests on US college campuses and whether he hears the message of young Americans: But Biden expanded, suggesting protesters have gone too far: There is a legitimate right to free speech and protest. There\u2019s a legitimate right to do that and they have a right to do that. But there\u2019s not a legitimate right to use hate speech. There\u2019s not a legitimate right to threaten Jewish students. There is not a legitimate right to block people\u2019s access to class. That\u2019s against the law. From there, he tried to pivot to explaining that he has counseled Israel to develop better plans for what to do in Gaza, and he compared it with mistakes the US made after 9/11 when it invaded Afghanistan and Iraq. \u201cIt made sense to get (Osama) bin Laden; it made no sense to try and unify Afghanistan. It made no sense in my view to engage in thinking that in Iraq they had a nuclear weapon,\u201d Biden said. Those are both political sore spots for Biden, who pulled US troops from Afghanistan, allowing the Taliban to reassert complete control of the country. He also voted in favor of invading Iraq as a US senator. \u25ba On whether US bombs have been used to kill civilians in Gaza: Biden said the US has delayed one shipment of powerful 2,000-pound bombs and that he has told Israelis he will not support their military\u2019s plan to conduct operations inside Rafah, in southern Gaza on the Egyptian border. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to get our support if in fact they go on these population centers,\u201d Biden said, although he promised the US would still help Israel protect itself from outside attacks. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to make sure Israel is secure in terms of Iron Dome and their ability to respond to attacks like came out of the Middle East recently,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/politics/cnn-interview-joe-biden-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}

David DePape was\u00a0convicted in November\u00a0of one count of assault on the immediate family member of a federal official, with the jury determining that he used a dangerous weapon, and a second count of attempted kidnapping of a federal official. According to\u00a0a memorandum\u00a0filed Friday, the Department of Justice argued DePape\u2019s actions constitute \u201ca federal crime of terrorism,\u201d which the DOJ states \u201cis calculated to influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation or coercion, or to retaliate against government conduct\u201d and \u201cincludes the attempted kidnapping of a Member of Congress.\u201d DePape\u2019s attorney, Jodi Linker, conceded during the trial that her client attacked the then-82-year-old Paul Pelosi, but argued that his motivation for the assault did not match the charges against him. \u201cThis case here is about the why \u2014 the why matters,\u201d Linker had argued to the jury. \u201cThis case is about whether David acted because of, on account of, Nancy Pelosi\u2019s duties as a member of Congress. He didn\u2019t, and he only struck Paul Pelosi in a quick moment of despair because the police arrived and his larger plan was thwarted.\u201d CNN has reached out to Linker for comment. During the trial, DePape, who described his political leanings as \u201cright of center,\u201d\u00a0told the jury\u00a0that he was focused on Nancy Pelosi and that her husband was not on his list of targets. He was \u201csurprised and confused,\u201d he said, when he found the congresswoman was not home. In his testimony, Paul Pelosi\u00a0recounted how he awoke the night of the attack to see a man with a hammer in his home. That man, later identified by police as DePape, asked where his wife was, he said.\u00a0\u201cShe\u2019s not here.\u00a0She\u2019s in Washington,\u201d Pelosi recalled answering. He later came to in a pool of blood after being violently struck in the head following a struggle with DePape, Pelosi said. Pelosi, who underwent surgery to repair a skull fracture and injuries to his hand and arm, told jurors that his recovery has been difficult. \u201cI\u2019ve made the best effort I possibly can to not revisit this,\u201d he said. The DOJ argued in the memo that \u201cBoth crimes are an assault on our democracy and fundamental values,\u201d and therefore should serve as a deterrent to others. \u201cAt a time when extremism has led to attacks on public and elected officials, this case presents a moment to speak to others harboring ideologically motivated violent dreams and plans,\u201d the Justice Department said. DePape\u2019s federal sentencing date is set for May 17, and he still faces charges at the state level in California. He has pleaded not guilty to state charges including attempted murder, burglary and assault.

{"id": "2024_05_12_politics_jamaal-bowman-gaza-war-reelection-new-york", "text": "The war in Gaza is reverberating all the way through north Bronx and Westchester County, defining the most competitive primary an incumbent House Democrat is facing anywhere in the country. That\u2019s where Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York, who got to Washington four years ago by winning a primary against one of Israel\u2019s then-most adamant defenders in Congress, is now facing a major challenger of his own, driven in part because of criticism of Israel that opponents say has put \u201cSquad\u201d-aligned politics ahead of what his district wants. Bowman became a central figure in taking on Israel from the first days after October 7, almost\u00a0immediately supporting\u00a0a resolution calling for a ceasefire that made no mention of Hamas or the return of Israeli hostages. By December, he was standing with hunger strikers outside the White House, upping his criticism of the actions in Gaza. He has called Israel an apartheid state, and\u00a0in a video that surfaced of him\u00a0speaking at a demonstration in November, said it was \u201cpropaganda\u201d and a \u201clie\u201d that Hamas raped Israeli women in the October 7 attacks, though he later attempted to clean up that remark.\u00a0(A United Nations report in March\u00a0found \u201cconvincing\u201d evidence that Hamas raped hostages.) He\u2019s gone far enough out that even the left-leaning Israel advocacy group J Street\u00a0withdrew its endorsement of Bowman in January, complaining that he had crossed a line in putting the blame for the conflict too much on Israel and not on Hamas. Now even many of Bowman\u2019s fellow New York Democrats in Congress say privately they doubt he will win \u2013 but more than that, when asked by CNN, several pointedly refused to say that they want Bowman to win, or that they would support him as the race enters its final month ahead of the June 25 primary. While Bowman says antisemitism is \u201cabhorrent\u201d and that his criticism is targeted at the way Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is conducting a war he believes could constitute genocide,\u00a0in some parts of\u00a0his\u00a0district,\u00a0his\u00a0response to October 7\u00a0is top of mind.\u00a0Even\u00a0Bowman supporters acknowledge he was already in deep trouble holding on to his seat by October 6. With national and international politics mixing into the race \u2013 and the situation only becoming more fraught as President Joe Biden distances himself from Netanyahu and a likely mass casualty invasion of Rafah looms \u2013 several leading Democratic operatives in Washington groaned at the mention of Bowman\u2019s name, upset that the situation has come to this. Shelley Mayer, a state senator whose district largely overlaps with the congressional district, initially backed Bowman. Bowman\u2019s response to the Hamas attack convinced her to switch\u00a0to endorse Westchester County Executive George Latimer. \u201cI believe that effective representation requires developing a bridge of trust and respect for all your constituents, even when there are disagreements,\u201d Mayer told CNN. \u201cAfter October 7, it was extremely evident that our congressman had failed to develop that relationship with almost every part of our large Jewish community, and I could not accept that.\u201d \u201cBoth personally as a Jew and as an elected official,\u201d Mayer added, \u201cI knew we deserved better.\u201d Bowman\u2019s response to the war crystallizes larger problems, including\u00a0\u00a0pulling a fire alarm in a House office building\u00a0last fall and public\u00a0shouting matches with Republican colleagues, who say he has gotten caught up in \u201cSquad\u201d-style politics. It\u2019s a reaction, though, that has made him so identified with the opposition to Israel that, within the space of three minutes last week on Capitol Hill, Bowman was first pressed by a Fox News reporter to call people who broke into university buildings \u201cdomestic terrorists\u201d (\u201cDo better,\u201d he scolded), and then praised by a young protester with a keffiyeh wrapped around her shoulders as one of the few members who gives her hope. Bowman said he knows people have called him anti-Israel because of moments like these, but, \u201cwhat they don\u2019t understand is us being critical of an ally, makes our allies stronger and safer in the long term.\u201d \u201cIf we are not critical in a healthy way, it leads to the cycle of violence that we\u2019re in right now,\u201d he added, telling CNN, \u201cIt\u2019s not criticism for criticism\u2019s sake, it\u2019s about how do we govern from the perspective of human rights and diplomacy and justice and \u2026 a free Palestine?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about a two-state solution for how long, man, where\u2019s the Palestinian state?\u201d Bowman asked. \u201cLet\u2019s do the work.\u201d Bowman\u2019s mixed history on Israel support Bowman voted for Iron Dome funding in 2021 and took a trip to Israel once in office, which led to the Democratic Socialists of America\u2019s New York chapter to consider expelling him, and the congressman in frustration let his membership lapse. The group did not return a request for comment on whether members would support him this time. Bowman is also supporting Biden for reelection, in contrast to Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, who ducked the question and walked away last week when asked by CNN whether she would vote for him. But the congresswoman, a Palestinian American who is arguably the most publicly identified Israel opponent in Washington, has formed a joint fundraising committee with Bowman to support him. Explaining how his response to the Israel-Hamas war fits his district, Bowman cited a poll conducted by his campaign that he claimed showed an overwhelming majority in his district support a permanent ceasefire. Bowman has proudly been critical of Netanyahu\u2019s handling of the war, noting that his home state\u2019s senior senator, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, has also called for new Israeli elections down the line. \u201cThe people of the district do not want taxpayer money and weapons going to Israel to continue to bomb children and support famine in Gaza,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cThey want that money to come to their community so they can afford child care and health care and workforce development and all those things.\u201d Bowman argued that while he\u2019s more interested in talking about guns, education and climate justice, Israel is being made into a major issue in this race because the super PAC of the pro-Israel lobbying group American Israel Public Affairs Committee is planning to spend millions against him \u2013 and that much of its money comes from MAGA Republican donors who he says are trying to destroy democracy. \u201cIt\u2019s a district issue because many Jews in the district care about the issue, and there\u2019s a large percentage of Jewish people in the district,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a local issue to other people because people are tired of being in war and they\u2019re tired of watching US dollars go overseas to whatever country, and US weapons go overseas to kill Black and brown vulnerable people, mostly.\u201d Some Bowman allies have warned Democrats that progressive voters would be deflated headed into November by seeing the incumbent New Yorker lose in a primary. \u201cPresident Biden needs Jamaal Bowman voters more than he needs George Latimer voters,\u201d said Usamah Andrabi, the communications director for the \u201cSquad\u201d-supportive Justice Democrats, which is also spending money to support the incumbent. Bowman\u2019s challenger says Israel support is important but not the point Bowman and Latimer are two very different men who have both spent their lives in a district that has some of the steepest contrasts of any in the country, from inner city to suburbia, from people on food stamps to people picking out tile patterns for their third and fourth homes. Bowman is 48, Black, lives in Yonkers and was a middle school principal before he made his first run for office four years ago to unseat an incumbent who had been representing the area since Jimmy Carter was president. Latimer is 70, white, lives in Rye and has spent 35 years moving up in local politics from city council to the state legislature to Westchester County executive. Most of Bowman\u2019s endorsements are from other members of the so-called Squad and from House Democratic leaders such as Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, who is from Brooklyn, rather than from local elected officials in his district. But among his supporters is Kevin Riley, a city councilman from the Bronx, who said he has never spoken with Latimer, but that on local issues, Bowman has been a \u201cgreat partner.\u201d In the northeast Bronx, Riley said, Israel doesn\u2019t come up much with voters. That it\u2019s showing up in other parts of the district is another demonstration of how disparate the constituents are. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d he said, \u201cbut a lot of times when you\u2019re running for office, it does seem like it happens.\u201d Latimer insists he\u2019s not running against Bowman so much as he is running against Bowman\u2019s approach to being in the House, promising that his pitch is not \u201cI\u2019m going down there to lead a movement, or I\u2019m going to be speaking truth to power on behalf of an identity or demographic.\u201d Asked about how October 7 and the aftermath have influenced his candidacy, Latimer said it was a factor but quickly redirected the conversation to flooding concerns in Westchester, which he said he hoped to address in a House bill. Latimer entered the race in December, but he said that local leaders had been encouraging him to run for a year and that he\u2019d been in touch with AIPAC since the summer. He blames Bowman for making Israel a big factor in the race, both through his own actions and by invoking AIPAC as the reason why he has a primary. Latimer would not directly answer when asked about Bowman\u2019s accusation that he is fine with Netanyahu staying in power, or about specifics on policy related to the conflict, while pointing out that he believes in the two-state solution that Netanyahu does not, and that he finds many of the prime minister\u2019s domestic policies \u201cdisagreeable.\u201d \u201cFor every member to give their opinion as if they were the secretary of state \u2013 \u2018I think Biden should have done this,\u2019 \u2018I heard about this, and \u2018I don\u2019t think he should do that\u2019 \u2013 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s productive,\u201d Latimer said. \u201cYou need to have a president who pursues a policy that includes the ability to both reward and punish and use those as part of a negotiating strategy that is not seen by the world until you\u2019ve come to some agreement.\u201d Running in his first race, Bowman\u00a0also criticized\u00a0his opponent for spending too much time talking about foreign policy at the expense of district issues. But in his interview last week, Bowman did not hesitate. He said he wanted to be clear that Israel has a right to exist, that \u201cit looks that way to me\u201d when asked whether he believes Israel has committed war crimes, and that Israel\u2019s actions have increased antisemitism. \u201cIt hurts our fight against antisemitism, because Israel claims to be the state for all Jewish people and people who perceive it from the outside looking in say, \u2018What the hell is going on here? Israel\u2019s bad, which means Jewish people are bad,\u2019\u201d Bowman said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we need to fight against.\u201d Speaking to CNN on her drive home after leaving a gala at her synagogue in Scarsdale, longtime state Assemblywoman Amy Paulin said in her fairly liberal community, it was notable how many people lined up to meet Latimer, who is Catholic, likening it to a \u201cworshipping of a hero.\u201d As for the race, \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a referendum on Israel, but I do know that the Jewish community \u2013 whether they\u2019re Reform, Conservative, Orthodox or Reconstructionist \u2013 are unified about the importance of Israel to the Jewish community,\u201d Paulin said, \u201cand Jamaal has no understanding of that.\u201d Arguing about AIPAC\u2019s influence Latimer hasn\u2019t made any secret of the support he\u2019s getting from AIPAC. He spoke at the group\u2019s donor conference in Washington in January. He has an online portal through the group to raise money. But AIPAC is far from the only group spending and activating in the district. The Democratic Majority for Israel (DMFI) has endorsed Latimer and is expecting to spend to boost him. A local group, Westchester Unites:\u00a0Jewish Voters in Action,\u00a0says it is spending six figures directly reaching out to thousands of Jewish voters and will amplify that with direct mail, digital ads, field organizers and grassroots events.\u00a0The National Black Empowerment Action Fund is pledging six figures to mobilize Black voters against Bowman. AIPAC and DMFI are expected to be by far the biggest spenders. Officials involved say much of their spending will be to attack Bowman for issues that have nothing to do with Israel, such as like his vote against the bipartisan infrastructure act \u2013 which some of the congressman\u2019s defenders argue is itself a measure of how unpopular support for Israel is. AIPAC affiliated super PAC United Democracy Project spokesman Patrick Dorton would not specify how much money the group plans to spend in the race, though he noted its many large Democratic donors are interested in defeating the congressman. Wednesday afternoon outside the Capitol, Bowman ran into Jeremy Ben-Ami, the executive director of J Street, the left-leaning pro-Israel group. They greeted each other with a friendly hug, despite the dropped endorsement. A few minutes later, Ben-Ami downplayed any greater significance for the outcome. \u201cThe Republican donors who fund the AIPAC super PAC are really excited to drive a wedge into the Democratic Party over this issue,\u201d Ben-Ami told CNN. \u201cThe majority of Democrats in the House, Democrats in the voting public, they\u2019re aligned with J Street. And that\u2019s going to be the majority position in the Democratic Party.\u201d Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer, the former Democratic majority leader who is an ally of AIPAC, brushed aside the group targeting some fellow Democrats. \u201cAIPAC, it does what it does,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m for our incumbents.\u201d While not mentioning Bowman specifically or calling out any members by name, Hoyer said some of his colleagues\u2019 rhetoric has given him pause. \u201cI regret that there are members who really are in effect, I think, reflecting the views of Hamas, which are to kill Jews and eliminate Israel,\u201d Hoyer said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/politics/jamaal-bowman-gaza-war-reelection-new-york/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_12_politics_us-officials-warn-rafah-invasion-israel-gaza", "text": "Top American officials offered stark warnings Sunday against an Israeli invasion of Rafah, predicting that a major ground offensive in the southern Gaza city would lead to widespread civilian casualties, spark a Hamas insurgency and create a power vacuum the terror group would later seek to fill. The alarm bells from US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan came after President Joe Biden delivered an ultimatum last week on CNN that an Israeli invasion of Rafah would cause him to pause certain weapons transfers. Blinken and Sullivan both said Biden made the determination because he didn\u2019t want American weapons used in what he estimates would be a bloody, ill-advised operation. At the same time, they sought to rebut claims from Republicans and pro-Israel Democrats that Biden was leaving Israel to fend for itself. And Blinken worked to explain why his agency last week was unable to make a full determination on whether Israel was upholding international law in its campaign against Hamas, a conclusion that drew criticism from human rights groups and some lawmakers. Blinken said on Sunday that the US believes Israel has killed more civilians than Hamas terrorists as part of its war in Gaza, and that Israel needs to do more to mitigate civilian deaths. \u201cWhile Israel has processes, procedures, rules, regulations to try to minimize civilian harm, given the impact that this operation, this war in Gaza has had on the civilian population, those have not been applied consistently and effectively,\u201d Blinken said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d The Ministry of Health in Gaza\u00a0reported Sunday\u00a0that the number of people killed in the enclave as a result of Israeli military operations has risen above 35,000. Despite American warnings dating back months about the wisdom of a ground invasion into Rafah, Israel appears poised to continue advancing on the city and has issued evacuation orders for some of the 1.4 million civilians estimated to be sheltering there. Going \u201cheadlong into Rafah\u201d could have dire consequences, Blinken warned Sunday. \u201cIsrael\u2019s on the trajectory, potentially, to inherit an insurgency with many armed Hamas left, or, if it leaves, a vacuum filled by chaos, filled by anarchy and probably refilled by Hamas,\u201d Blinken said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Sullivan, meanwhile, warned an Israel operation would cause \u201creally significant civilian casualties\u201d while still being unlikely to eliminate Hamas. That is partly why Biden determined that American weapons should not be used in a Rafah offensive. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to see American weapons used in that kind of operation,\u201d Sullivan said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not to say that he is going to abandon Israel or cut them off from weapons. He was focused on a particular operation that he doesn\u2019t believe will succeed in defeating Hamas and that will cause grievous harm.\u201d Sullivan on Sunday spoke by phone with his Israeli counterpart, Tzachi Hanegbi, and \u201creiterated President Biden\u2019s longstanding concerns over the potential for a major military ground operation into Rafah,\u201d the White House said. \u201cMr. Hanegbi confirmed that Israel is taking US concerns into account,\u201d according to a\u00a0White House readout of the call. Blinken said Israel had resisted American advice for developing a plan for Gaza once the war ends. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working for many, many weeks on developing critical plans for security, for governance, for rebuilding. We haven\u2019t seen that come from Israel, we\u2019ve been working with Arab countries and others on that plan. We need to see that too. We have the same objective as Israel. We want to make sure that Hamas cannot govern Gaza again,\u201d he told CBS. Last week, the State Department released a report finding it is \u201creasonable to assess\u201d that US weapons have been used by Israeli forces in\u00a0Gaza\u00a0in ways that are \u201cinconsistent\u201d with international humanitarian law. But\u00a0the report stopped short of officially saying Israel violated the law. \u201cWe don\u2019t have double standards. We treat Israel, one of our closest allies and partners, just as we would treat any other country,\u201d Blinken said on NBC. Still, he said making such a full determination was impossible amid the war. \u201cThat makes it very difficult to determine, particularly in the midst of war, exactly what happened and to draw any final conclusions from any one incident,\u201d Blinken told CBS. The top US diplomat downplayed a growing rift between Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, even as the relationship endures its tensest moment since  Hamas\u2019 October 7 attacks. \u201cWe are clear-eyed, and we speak the truth to each other as we see it,\u201d Blinken said. \u201cWe have American interests first and foremost in mind. We also have Israel\u2019s interests in mind. And there may be a difference in view and in the best way to achieve them. But that\u2019s also the nature of the relationship.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

The event \u2013 set to\u00a0feature the former president, George Clooney and Julia Roberts, among others \u2013 will seek to expand Biden\u2019s cash advantage against former President Donald Trump, a Biden campaign official told CNN. His campaign plans to run a contest for supporters that features Clooney and Roberts, who have appeared in several movies together since the 2001 heist caper \u201cOcean\u2019s Eleven.\u201d The movie stars also plan to appear on social media posts and digital ads promoting Biden\u2019s campaign. The plans were first reported by NBC News. Obama has already participated in one fundraiser for Biden: March\u2019s mega-event,\u00a0alongside former President Bill Clinton,\u00a0at Radio City Music Hall in New York, which drew in $26 million. Obama is expected to ramp up campaign efforts as the election nears. News of the star-studded fundraiser came as the Biden campaign raised $10 million over 24 hours during the president\u2019s West Coast swing last week, according to a source familiar. Biden participated in four fundraisers, two in the Bay Area and two in the Seattle area. Biden\u2019s figures for last month will be released in the coming week. The president\u2019s cash advantage over Trump has been one of the unquestionable bright spots of his campaign. A mostly uncontested Democratic primary allowed Biden to consolidate support among Democratic donors early, compared with the fight for donors among the GOP field. The last filings available, for March, showed Biden with nearly twice the amount of cash in his coffers than Trump. Biden\u2019s campaign has used the money on television ads, staffing in battleground states and travel. Now that Trump has clinched the GOP nomination, however, his fundraising has accelerated. He has raised tens of millions of dollars at individual events over the last several weeks, including a record $50.5 million at an April fundraiser in Florida. Trump\u2019s advisers told donors earlier this month that he brought in $76 million in April.

{"id": "2024_05_08_politics_donald-trump-trials-delayed-what-matters", "text": "Former President Donald Trump\u2019s public defense against his four, distinct prosecutions in four, separate jurisdictions is that they are a coordinated hit job and a political persecution \u2013 evidence, he says, of a double standard of justice. Disproving Trump\u2019s allegation is the likelihood, which seems to be growing this week, that three of the four criminal prosecutions might not reach the courtroom before Election Day. The other prosecution \u2013 generally seen as the weakest case against Trump \u2013 has provided salacious and embarrassing moments for the former president. But the facts of that case in New York, focused on his effort to hide an alleged affair rather than his conduct as president or his effort to overturn the 2020 election, feel like something from a different time. Trump has pleaded not guilty in all of the cases. If Trump could manufacture a conspiracy theory out of the fact that separate grand juries in New York, Florida, Georgia and Washington, DC, all independently approved charges against him, what would he make of the following series of events? Classified documents case postponed indefinitely Indictment: June 8, 2023, with a superseding indictment filed July 27, 2023. Trial date: Delayed indefinitely. Trump appointed the judge in the Florida case, Aileen Cannon, which doesn\u2019t necessarily mean anything. But Cannon has angered critics who see slow-walking in the length of time she takes to return decisions and pandering in her deference to Trump\u2019s requests to delay the trial. On Tuesday, Cannon scratched the planned May trial date and did not pencil in a new one. With multiple outstanding issues in the federal case, legal experts are now doubting the trial \u2013 in which special counsel Jack Smith alleges Trump mishandled classified data he refused to turn over to the National Archives \u2013 will occur before November. Trump\u2019s former White House counsel Ty Cobb, now a Trump critic, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett Tuesday night that Cannon has so far failed in the trial. \u201cI think it was always her objective, frankly, to prevent this from going to trial,\u201d Cobb told Burnett. In the judge\u2019s slow work, Cobb sees \u201ca combination of bias and incompetence.\u201d The Supreme Court\u2019s slow schedule is helping Trump Indictment: August 1, 2023. Trial date: Delayed indefinitely. The other federal case, in which Smith accuses Trump of conspiring to overturn the 2020 election results and rob Americans of their democratic rights, is also on hold in Washington, DC, thanks to the US Supreme Court. First, justices refused to fast-track reviewing Trump\u2019s dubious claim of \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d from criminal prosecution, instead preferring to allow that claim to proceed through oral arguments before a panel of judges in a lower court. When that lower court rejected Trump\u2019s absolute immunity claim, however, the Supreme Court suddenly wanted to have its say. Conservative justices, three of whom were appointed by Trump, seemed to not necessarily buy into the more outlandish extremes of his argument during a hearing last month \u2013 such as the hypothetical scenario of Seal Team 6 being ordered to take out a political rival \u2013 but they were intrigued enough to suggest their decision will not simply allow the trial to go forward. Whenever they get around to issuing it, that is. Could be June or July! Which would leave little time for a trial. Trump\u2019s effort to disqualify the prosecutor in Georgia continues Indictment: August 14, 2023. Trial date: Delayed indefinitely. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis\u2019 relationship with a prosecutor shouldn\u2019t necessarily have anything to do with the allegations against Trump, which are related to his effort to overturn election results in Georgia in 2020. But the fallout of her decision to employ her former boyfriend is helping Trump. The Georgia Court of Appeals said Wednesday it would consider Trump\u2019s appeal of Judge Scott McAfee\u2019s decision to allow Willis to remain on the case. The New York Case is salacious, but where does it lead? Indictment: Unsealed April 4, 2023. Trial: Ongoing. The tawdry details of Trump\u2019s alleged affair with adult-film star Stormy Daniels are nothing Trump wanted to see, as he stared Daniels down in court on Tuesday. Trump\u2019s lawyers may drag out the cross-examination of Daniels when the trial resumes on Thursday as they seek to impeach her credibility. That should be a preview of the trial\u2019s coming showdown between Trump\u2019s former fixer Michael Cohen, an admitted liar and convicted felon, and attorneys for the boss for whom Cohen says he broke campaign finance law. There may have been a good reason federal prosecutors passed on this case and decided not to pursue it. The point here is that for all of Trump\u2019s controversial actions as president and his clear attempt to change election results, a conviction for falsifying business records, if it even comes, may not be what sways those few voters in swing states who will decide this election. Trump\u2019s prosecutions are no grand conspiracy of election interference. They\u2019re part of a slow-working justice system in which it helps to have the resources, thanks to donors, to pay an army of lawyers who can gum up the works. Trump\u2019s long-standing strategy is to delay his trials, get elected and then work to make them go away. From that perspective, this has been a good week for him.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/politics/donald-trump-trials-delayed-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_politics_brett-kavanaugh-presidential-power-caitlin-clark-taylor-swift-security", "text": "Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh told an Austin judicial conference on Friday that his experience in the George W. Bush administration has made him more skeptical of presidential assertions of regulatory power. His comments on the issue (he also discussed Taylor Swift and Caitlin Clark) were especially salient in light of the many challenges to the Biden administration policies on which the court is expected to rule by the end of June. Referring to his 2001-2006 tenure as a lawyer for Bush, Kavanaugh said he was \u201cin the room\u201d as regulations were written and saw first-hand the \u201cpressures\u201d on administrations to push the limits of their statutory power, whether over the environment, immigration or health care. \u201cIt gives me a good, for want of a better term, B.S. detector,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the executive branch says, \u2018We can\u2019t possibly do this.\u2019 \u2026 I think to myself \u2026 I saw it done.\u201d Kavanaugh observed that presidential candidates regularly campaign on a reform agenda but then become stymied in their priorities by the legislative process and congressional gridlock. That creates an incentive for presidents to push the boundaries of their regulatory authority, he said, emphasizing that the phenomenon affects both political parties. \u201cThe judiciary is there to help police those boundaries,\u201d Kavanaugh said. The comments of Kavanaugh, a 2018 appointee of former President Donald Trump, may hint at the conservative court majority\u2019s resolution of pending disputes testing the bounds of an array of federal regulation. Since the six-justice conservative majority coalesced in 2020, the court has taken longer strides to constrain federal regulators, from the environment and consumer finance to public health and workplace safety. One pair of pending cases could lead to its most substantial move against regulatory power in decades; those cases test a 1984 decision, Chevron USA v. Natural Resources Defense Council, that requires federal judges to defer to US agencies\u2019 views of their statutory mandates for policy. Business groups, backed by Republican-run states, contend the Chevron principle has led to unlawful bureaucratic intrusions and given the government the upper hand in litigation. The Biden administration, defending the Chevron precedent and multiple agency policies now under challenge, has stressed the importance of executive-branch expertise and comprehensive nationwide protections for the public good. The Eras Tour and an \u2018expensive\u2019 trip to see Caitlin Clark play Kavanaugh\u2019s hourlong appearance Friday in the ballroom of an Austin hotel came as the high court enters its tensest weeks, negotiating in private to resolve dozens of cases by the traditional late June deadline. He answered questions from 5th\u00a0Circuit Chief Judge Priscilla Richman at the circuit\u2019s annual judicial conference. By and large, Richman\u2019s questions were on the lighter side, including those that opened a window on Kavanaugh\u2019s extracurricular life. He said that his two high school daughters, now a sophomore and senior, control much of his off-bench time. He attended his first Taylor Swift concert in 2012, he told Richman after she asked if he had attended an Eras Tour concert. Yes, the justice said, Kavanaugh describing himself as \u201cway ahead of the curve\u201d with his Swiftie fandom. And he has taken his daughters to multiple NCAA basketball tournaments, including the first round in Iowa last March. The justice recounted that on the Thursday night before that tournament weekend, his older daughter was talking about players she knew, from her own high school basketball team, that would be competing against Iowa\u2019s Caitlin Clark. Kavanaugh\u2019s younger daughter said, \u201cWe should go!\u201d A few beats later, Kavanaugh agreed: \u201cWe\u00a0should\u00a0go. We went. \u2026 I got on StubHub, got the tickets, got the flights, probably one of the most expensive 48 hours.\u201d But he added, \u201cTo go to Iowa and see the phenomena of Caitlin Clark. That\u2019s a lifetime memory that I did on the spur of the moment.\u201d Security concerns at home On a far more serious note about his daughters, Kavanaugh said that they have grown up with constant court police security. Asked about the intense security for individual justices since 2022, when the opinion reversing Roe v. Wade first leaked, the justice said his security detail is \u201c24/7 at the home\u201d and accompanies him when he travels. When Richman asked if protesters still show up at his home, a pattern that intensified after he joined the Dobbs ruling reversing Roe, Kavanaugh said, \u201coccasionally \u2026 not as much. I think I\u2019ll leave it there.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/politics/brett-kavanaugh-presidential-power-caitlin-clark-taylor-swift-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_12_politics_menendez-gold-cash-what-matters", "text": "Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey faces his second, distinct bribery and corruption trial in seven years starting Monday. This new case is a complicated affair involving multiple gold bars, envelopes of cash, a Mercedes and a lot more that, prosecutors say, the powerful former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and his new wife (they got married during the alleged bribery scheme) obtained in exchange for helping a halal meat monopoly, granting favors for people from Egypt and Qatar and trying to influence a New Jersey prosecution. Menendez, who has until June to announce if he\u2019s running for reelection, has pleaded not guilty and denied all of the charges. He told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju on Capitol Hill last week, \u201cI am\u00a0looking forward to proving my innocence.\u201d Also pleading not guilty and denying wrongdoing are his wife Nadine, who is also a named as a defendant, and two businessmen, Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, who have ties to Egypt and Qatar, respectively. Another man, New Jersey businessman Jose Uribe, on the other hand, has pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. Here\u2019s what prosecutors say the senator and his wife got: Gold bars Prosecutors say Hana and Daibes gave Menendez and his wife gold bars, which were seized by the FBI from the Menendez residence. After returning from a trip to Egypt and getting a ride home from the airport from Daibes\u2019 driver, prosecutors say Menendez searched online for the price of a gold bar. Envelopes full of cash The indictment includes photos of piles of cash next to envelopes spread across jackets on which the senator\u2019s name is embroidered. There are piles of $20 bills and $50 bills in one photo and $100 bills in another photo. They also found cash in closets, a safe and Nadine Menendez\u2019s safety deposit box. Some of the envelopes, according to prosecutors, bore fingerprints or DNA belonging to Daibes or his driver. Total cash discovered: More than $480,000 in the home and more than $70,000 in the safety deposit box. Later court filings that added charges in the case are more specific, describing bags full of cash being found on top of hangers in the senator\u2019s basement and stuffed into boots in the closet. Convertible Mercedes The 2019 vehicle, which prosecutors value at more than $60,000, was parked in the driveway at the Menendez home when it was raided. The indictment describes Nadine Menendez obtaining $15,000 in cash from Uribe in a parking lot the day before she picked the vehicle up and put $15,000 as a down payment. Uribe is alleged to have then hid his monthly financing payments for the vehicle. Later, after the raid, she would write Uribe a $21,000 check, which prosecutors say was an effort at cleanup, making the gift look like a loan. Nadine Menendez needed a new car, apparently after hitting and killing a jaywalker in Bogota, New Jersey, in December 2018. A police report was filed but she faced no charges. Mortgage payment Prosecutors say the senator and his wife also tried to cover up around $23,000 in help Nadine Menendez got from a halal meat company owned by Hana that bailed her out of foreclosure on a mortgage. Reimbursement checks were paid in December 2022, months after the initial raid on the senator\u2019s house. Payment for low- or no-show work Hana\u2019s company paid Nadine Menendez $10,000 on three occasions, according to prosecutors. At the time, they allege, she was acting as a sort of go-between for Egyptian officials, Hana and the senator. Engagement ring Prosecutors describe a recorded conversation between Hana and a confidential source in which Hana is described as obtaining $150,000 from a man to purchase a car and an engagement ring for Nadine Menendez in exchange for the senator giving a \u201cpush\u201d in a New Jersey criminal case that saved the man three years. Basement carpeting Prosecutors said in their February court filing that Nadine Menendez arranged for carpeting to be installed in her basement, apparently in exchange for setting up dinners between the senator and officials \u2013 and also for his call, according to prosecutors, attempting to interfere in a New Jersey state prosecution. Furniture The initial September 2023 indictment makes several mentions of furniture and furnishings provided by Hana and Daibes but does not go into specifics. Formula One tickets In a superseding indictment filed in March, prosecutors allege Menendez obtained tickets to Formula One races in 2022 and 2023 for Nadine Menendez\u2019s relative. Menendez made comments supportive of Qatar during that period and lobbied Qatari officials to invest in Daibes\u2019 real estate venture, which they ultimately did. Daibes is described as sending the senator pictures of luxury watches priced between roughly $10,000 and $24,000, but it is not clear from the filing if Menendez ever obtained a timepiece. What\u2019s the quid pro quo? There is a long list of actions prosecutors say Menendez undertook in exchange for all of these alleged bribes. They allege Menendez, in his prior role as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: \u2026 lobbied the US Department of Agriculture to maintain Hana\u2019s monopoly on US halal meat exports to Egypt, even though it drove up prices. \u2026 met with Egyptian officials in exchange for cash. \u2026 gave Hana not-classified but also not-public information about employees at the US embassy in Egypt. \u2026 passed on information about US military sales to Egypt to Hana and signed off on certain sales. \u2026 lobbied Qataris on behalf of Daibes\u2019 real estate scheme and supported resolutions in the Senate supportive of Qatar. \u2026 tried to influence court cases in New Jersey related to Uribe and his associates. Uribe, recall, is now cooperating with prosecutors. \u2026 tried to disrupt a federal prosecution of Daibes.  Again, Menendez denies all the charges, and the jury that will get to hear his side of the story will begin to be selected in New York starting Monday. Nadine Menendez\u2019s trial is slated for July. Perhaps Menendez and his wife can convincingly argue the mortgage and car payments were a loan. Perhaps Menendez will argue he did not know about payments related to dinners and meetings organized by his wife. The envelopes of cash prosecutors say bore Daibes\u2019 fingerprints may be more difficult to explain. Menendez escaped previous bribery charge Menendez is used to being under the microscope of federal prosecutors. The Department of Justice ultimately decided not to retry Menendez in 2018 after a previous jury deadlocked over whether he accepted trips and gifts from a friend, an ophthalmologist named Salomon Melgen. Melgen went to prison in a separate Medicare fraud scheme, but that sentence was commuted by then-President Donald Trump after lobbying by Menendez on Melgen\u2019s behalf.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/politics/menendez-gold-cash-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_04_24_politics_georgia-suburban-shift-2024-election", "text": "Rebel Teahouse is Christine Nguyen\u2019s business. And her happy place. Nguyen, 29, was a neuro ICU nurse, often treating patients who suffered a stroke or had brain cancer. Stressful enough, and then Covid-19 hit. \u201cWe were right there \u2013 frontline,\u201d Nguyen told us in an interview. \u201cThere were all these battles about whether or not we should be vaccinated. \u2026 Seeing all the death didn\u2019t help either.\u201d So Nguyen left her nursing job and became an entrepreneur, opening a boba tea shop in a place that, like her, is in the middle of giant change. \u201cTwo or three years ago, I would definitely be in scrubs. I would be tired,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cNowadays, if you come into the shop, you will see I am always happy. There is just this different air \u2013 that I feel I can bring something to the community.\u201d Decatur is in DeKalb County, one of the growing Atlanta suburbs that in 2020 rebuked Donald Trump and helped Joe Biden flip Georgia blue and win the White House. Trump\u2019s caustic tone is one source of his suburban struggles; his erratic handling of the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 things like questioning science and suggesting ingesting bleach might help \u2013 made things worse. \u201cI definitely did not want Trump to win again,\u201d Nguyen said. Yet she couldn\u2019t bring herself to vote for Biden and didn\u2019t vote that year. \u201cBecause he was out of touch with our generation,\u201d Nguyen said. This year, Nguyen says she will vote, and every few months she allows a local voter registration group to set up tables at Rebel. She still has reservations about Biden, including his age and his handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict. But she sees voting as essential. \u201cThe battle that is going on right now with abortion, I think that is something that speaks to me,\u201d Nguyen said. Still, she is undecided because of her qualms about Biden. But she\u2019s not a Trump fan. And looking at Georgia\u2019s 2020 math, she said, \u201cGoing third party, it feels like you are throwing your vote away.\u201d That 2020 margin was just shy of 12,000 votes, so every shift matters here. Our visit was part of a CNN project to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in the battleground states \u2013 and the communities within them \u2013 that will determine the presidential winner. That Georgia is among them is still a bit of a shock to locals. \u201cI never thought that could happen,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cI was, like, that\u2019s awesome.\u201d Explaining Georgia\u2019s suburban evolution Jan and Celia Gardner are conservatives and consistent Republican voters living Georgia\u2019s political change. They bought a home in the DeKalb enclave of Dunwoody 27 years ago. \u201cPretty much a conservative community,\u201d is how Jan Gardner remembers it back then. \u201cWe are now a split community.\u201d The Gardners wish Trump would tone down his rhetoric but are loyal Republicans who see Biden as weak and believe the former president would lower taxes and improve border security. Jan Gardner says it is time to move on from debates about the 2020 election results, but he does echo many other Trump grievances. \u201cI don\u2019t think we trust the DOJ,\u201d he said of the Justice Department. \u201cI don\u2019t think we trust the FBI. I don\u2019t think we trust the CIA. We don\u2019t trust most of government. We just don\u2019t.\u201d Their street is trademark suburbia. Neat lawns. Spring flowers in bloom. Trees filling in green. It\u2019s the kind of place people take evening strolls, walk the dogs, watch the kids play. All that, Jan Gardner says, is a constant of the past quarter century. One change: people are much more hesitant to talk politics. Schools come up. Traffic. Local taxes. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much where it stops,\u201d Jan Gardner said. \u201cYou have a pretty good idea of why.\u201d Jan Gardner is retired. Celia runs a small travel agency. A getting-to-know-you conversation around the kitchen counter is engaging and entertaining. But these days, they said, putting people with different political views in the chairs is too risky. A visitor asks this: Why can\u2019t politics be fun? \u201cIt is as long as everybody\u2019s thinking the same way,\u201d Celia Gardner said. It would be easy to overlook DeKalb County\u2019s role in the 2020 stunner here, because it was at the forefront of Georgia\u2019s demographic and political shift. In the 2000 Census, DeKalb was majority Black \u2013 54% \u2013 and that number was up just a tad 20 years later. Over that time, the percentage of White DeKalb residents dropped a bit, while the Latino and Asian populations grew. What\u2019s really driving America\u2019s suburban shift blue, however, is education level: 36% of DeKalb residents had a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher in 2000; it is now 47%. In the 2000 election, Democrat Al Gore received 70% in DeKalb; in 2020, Biden won 83%. An inclination to vote third-party \u2013 unless it\u2019s close The suburban shift is even more pronounced in Gwinnett County. In 2000, Gwinnett had a population of 588,448 residents; 67% were White and 34% had a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. George W. Bush won the county with 64%. Now, Gwinnett\u2019s population is approaching 1 million, the White share of the population is down to 32% and the percentage of county residents with at least four years of college is up to 39%. Biden won Gwinnett County with 58%. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of change, a lot more diversity which is good,\u201d said Kim Cavaliere, a school nurse who moved to Gwinnett County two decades ago. \u201cI see a lot of growth. \u2026 Probably too much growth.\u201d Ask Cavaliere to list her big issues, and you get health care, prescription drug costs, abortion rights, opposition to the availability of assault-style rifles. \u201cDemocrat, right,\u201d she said with a laugh. But Cavaliere has lost faith in both national political parties and voted for third-party candidates in both 2016 and 2020. She just might go that route again this November. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel comfortable with Biden\u2019s age and I don\u2019t feel comfortable with Trump\u2019s mouth,\u201d Cavaliere said. Count Cavaliere as among those stunned by the 2020 result here. \u201cI was actually in shock,\u201d she said. Knowing Georgia is now a battleground could influence Cavaliere\u2019s 2024 decision. \u201cHis age is really concerning to me,\u201d she said of the 81-year-old president. Plus, Cavaliere added: \u201cWith Biden comes the vice president that I know nothing about and who hasn\u2019t really done anything honestly that I can be happy with.\u201d Cavaliere speaks nostalgically of the pre-Covid Trump economy but said she could never vote for him because of his erratic behavior as president, culminating with his actions on January 6, 2021. \u201cThe way he talks. The way he runs his mouth and get, you know, people going and different groups going and fighting,\u201d Cavaliere said. She\u2019s still inclined to vote third-party again but is perhaps open to reconsidering if Georgia could settle a close race. \u201cYou have two people and I just don\u2019t have a lot of faith in either one,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as far as being a little more secure, as far as being a little bit more rational \u2013 Biden. \u2026 I might not have a choice.\u201d Carey Fulks wants to keep Georgia blue but he, too, wishes he had a different choice. \u201cFor all of the negative things you can say about the Republicans, at least they have people out there running who seem passionate,\u201d said Fulks, 35. He moved back in with his parents during Covid-19 and is skeptical when he hears Biden describe the economy as booming. \u201cPart-time substitute teacher, part-time DoorDasher, part-time everything, almost,\u201d is how Fulks describes his economy. \u201cAll I could find at the moment. Just taking jobs as they come.\u201d He is back in the Grove Park neighborhood where he grew up, and sees a lot of change here in Atlanta. \u201cWe\u2019re a transient city,\u201d Fulks said. \u201cSo most people who are here aren\u2019t from here.\u201d Biden won 73% of the vote in Fulton County \u2013 Atlanta and the closest suburbs \u2013 and high turnout will again be critical to his Georgia chances. Fulks will be there for the president, though he describes his motivation as \u201cmore against Trump, probably.\u201d Adjusting to the realities of living in a purple state Hall County is about an hour\u2019s drive north of downtown Atlanta, less from most of DeKalb or Gwinnett. It is rural, and reliably red \u2013 Trump won 71% of the county vote in 2020. Matt Vrahiotes fits right in here \u2013 Christian, conservative, Republican. \u201cI try to vote with my Bible, I really do,\u201d Vrahiotes said an an interview. \u201cI try to think: what is the moral thing to do? What is the right thing to do? But it\u2019s been a little harder over the past couple of years to pick a candidate that I think fits what I believe and what I like.\u201d Eight years ago, Vrahiotes and his wife opened Sweet Acre Farms, a fruit winery tucked into the rolling hills of Alto, a tiny town of about 1,000 people. \u201cThe first winery in Hall County since Prohibition,\u201d Vrahiotes said. We spoke just as Trump\u2019s first criminal trial was getting under way \u2013 the New York case related to a hush money payment to an adult film actress. \u201cIt sounds crazy,\u201d Vrahiotes said. \u201cIt sounds like an irresponsible person, an irresponsible thing to do.\u201d He added, though, that he has \u201cthings that are morally in question for both\u201d Biden and Trump. Vrahiotes supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the GOP primaries and wishes someone other than Trump had won. \u201cI\u2019m not a Trumper,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not somebody who\u2019s got the flag in the back of my truck running around and that sort of thing. Honestly, I wish there was another candidate who would have come through the primaries. \u2026 I like to call myself a reasonable Republican.\u201d His issue list leans Republican. But his qualms about Trump have him shopping. \u201cAt this point, I really don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cKennedy is somebody we could also kind of take into consideration,\u201d he added, referring to independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Again, in a state where every shift matters, Vrahiotes is aware a third-party vote in Hall County could, in the end, help Biden. \u201cBut you also have to vote the way you feel it needs to be voted for,\u201d Vrahiotes said. Whether Vrahiotes will ultimately tell us his choice is an open question, his caution born of two things: Georgia\u2019s newfound battleground status and the political leanings of the customers who fill the winery\u2019s tasting room. \u201cYou really have to be careful about the things that you do and the things that you say,\u201d Vrahiotes said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s part of being a small business owner. You are in a purple state. You have 50% one way and 50% the other.\u201d Vrahioties did tell us he voted for Trump in 2016. But he declined to say who he voted for in 2020 \u2013 when Georgia\u2019s flip blue made things here a lot more complicated. \u201cAtlanta\u2019s not far from here \u2013 it\u2019s an hour away,\u201d Vrahiotes said. \u201cI literally turn bottles of wine into shoes for my kids and registration for soccer. If I sit here and ostracize 50% of my community, or 50% of my customers \u2026 it could hurt me. It could hurt my business tremendously. Because as of late, people are dividing themselves. You\u2019re for this guy or you\u2019re for this guy. And it\u2019s hard, it\u2019s really hard to play the middle.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/24/politics/georgia-suburban-shift-2024-election/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_05_politics_fact-check-trumps-false-courthouse-claims-last-week", "text": "Former President Donald Trump continues to make false claims about his New York trial. Trump frequently speaks to media cameras before entering and after exiting the Manhattan courtroom where he is facing charges of falsifying business records.He has peppered his hallway remarks with inaccurate assertions about a variety of subjects \u2014 most frequently about the trial itself. Here\u2019s a fact check of four false claims and one misleading claim he made about the trial in his courthouse comments last week. (And here\u2019s a link to our fact check of his courthouse falsehoods from the week prior.) Trump\u2019s right to testify Trump falsely claimed after leaving the courtroom Thursday afternoon that he is not allowed to testify in his own defense \u2013 then acknowledged Friday morning that he is indeed allowed to testify. Trump\u00a0told\u00a0reporters Thursday, \u201cI\u2019m not allowed to testify. I\u2019m under a gag order. I guess, right?\u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019m not allowed to testify, because this judge, who\u2019s totally conflicted, has me under an unconstitutional gag order.\u201d He continued by complaining that he\u2019s \u201cnot allowed to talk\u201d even when others attack him, then said again, \u201cSo I\u2019m not allowed to testify because of an unconstitutional gag order.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim is false. As he noted the next day, he is allowed to testify at the trial; the decision is entirely up to him.\u00a0Judge Juan Merchan\u2019s gag order, which narrowly restricts his out-of-court speech, does not in any way stop him from testifying. The gag order also does not broadly prevent Trump from talking. He is permitted to speak to the media, speak at campaign events, attack President Joe Biden and other political opponents, and even attack Merchan and the Manhattan\u00a0district attorney behind the case. On Friday morning, Trump\u00a0told reporters\u00a0as he entered the courtroom: \u201cNo, it won\u2019t stop me from testifying. The gag order\u2019s not for testify[ing]. The gag order stops me from talking about people, and responding, when they say things about me.\u201d When court proceedings began shortly after, Merchan told Trump that he has the \u201cabsolute\u201d right to testify and that the gag order \u201cdoes not prohibit you from taking the stand and it does not limit or minimize what you can say.\u201d Rather, the gag order\u00a0forbids Trump from three specific categories of speech: 1) Speaking publicly or directing others to speak publicly about known or foreseeable witnesses, specifically about their participation in the case; 2) Speaking publicly or directing others to speak publicly about prosecutors (other than Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg), members of the district attorney\u2019s staff and the court staff, or family members of any of these people including Bragg, if those statements are made with the intent to interfere with the case; 3) Speaking publicly or directing others to speak publicly about jurors or prospective jurors. Trump has\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0made the gag order sound far broader than it is. He\u00a0claimed\u00a0at a Wednesday campaign rally in Michigan that \u201cI\u2019m not even supposed to be, I would say, talking to you, because he gagged me\u201d \u2013 though the gag order actually says nothing to prevent him from making a campaign speech. Merchan wrote in the gag order: \u201cDefendant has a constitutional right to speak to the American voters freely, and to defend himself publicly.\u201d Trump\u2019s public stance on whether he will testify has varied. After declaring before the trial started\u00a0that\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m testifying,\u201d he\u00a0said\u00a0in a television interview last week that he would testify \u201cif it\u2019s necessary.\u201d Thursday was the first time he has publicly claimed he is not permitted to testify. Trump and bail Trump said: \u201cNew York City is a violent city; it\u2019s become violent with the cashless bail. I\u2019m the only one who has to put up bail.\u201d\u00a0 Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim is false. Like many other New York defendants whose alleged crimes are\u00a0non-violent, he\u00a0didn\u2019t have to put up bail. After his arraignment in 2023, he was released on his own recognizance \u2014 in other words, without having to post any cash.\u00a0 Trump did have to post\u00a0a $200,000 bond\u00a0in his separate election subversion case in Fulton County, Georgia (contributing 10% himself\u00a0and working with a bail bonds company to cover the rest), but his clear Friday suggestion was that he is being treated uniquely harshly in New York. He was released on his own recognizance in his two\u00a0federal\u00a0criminal\u00a0cases\u00a0\u2014\u00a0one in Washington, DC, over his attempts to overturn the 2020 election, and one in Florida over his post-presidency retention of classified documents. Trump\u2019s assertion that New York City is \u201ca violent city\u201d is subjective. It\u2019s worth noting, though, that violent crime in the city has\u00a0plummeted over the last two decades, that the city has long had\u00a0lower crime rates than many other big and small communities\u00a0around the country, and that the impact of New York state bail reforms on the city\u2019s recent crime levels is disputed. Trump\u2019s campaign schedule Trump continued Friday to complain that the New York trial is preventing him from being on the campaign trail. This time, he said: \u201cWe were already marked down \u2014 months ago, we were marked down to be in Georgia today, where we\u2019re doing very well at the polls, by the way. But that\u2019s where we were supposed to be. We\u2019re supposed to be in Ohio tomorrow and we\u2019re supposed to be in Florida on the next day, doing \u2014 campaigning, essentially campaigning. So now I have to go through this trial day after day.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim that the trial is preventing him from having campaign events this weekend is false. The trial is not being held on weekends (or on Wednesdays), so he was free to campaign wherever he wants on Saturday and the day after \u2014 and he was planning to fly to Florida.\u00a0Trump was scheduled to headline a closed-door\u00a0Republican National Committee fundraising luncheon at his Mar-a-Lago club on Saturday, and he attended the Miami Grand Prix Formula One race on Sunday.\u00a0 There is no apparent basis for Trump\u2019s claim that he was supposed to be in Ohio on Saturday; he is\u00a0planning to visit the state on May 15, another court-free Wednesday. And it\u2019s unclear what his campaign internally \u201cmarked down,\u201d but he had never publicly scheduled a campaign event for Georgia on Friday. Trump\u00a0held campaign rallies in Wisconsin and Michigan on Wednesday, and he had a rally planned for North Carolina the previous Saturday that was\u00a0called off because of severe weather. However, he has regularly declined to visit swing states or hold public events on his days without court,\u00a0opting instead\u00a0to host dinners and meetings at Trump Tower in Manhattan or to play golf at his club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Trump and the \u2018advice of counsel\u2019 Trump complained Tuesday that Merchan was not allowing him to invoke the advice he claims he was given by lawyers.\u00a0Criminal defendants sometimes employ an \u201cadvice of counsel\u201d defense\u00a0to try to demonstrate that they had not intended to break the law. \u201cHere, I\u2019m not even allowed to say \u2018advice of counsel.\u2019 This is a new one to me, \u2018advice of counsel,\u2019\u201d Trump told reporters outside the courtroom. \u201cWhen you have a lawyer and the lawyer does something or advises you on something, you say \u2018advice of counsel.\u2019 He said you\u2019re not allowed to say that.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s claim is misleading. He failed to mention that the reason Merchan will not allow Trump\u2019s legal team to invoke \u201cadvice of counsel\u201d during the trial is that, when Trump was asked before the trial whether he would be using an \u201cadvice of counsel\u201d defense,\u00a0his lawyers\u00a0told Merchan he would not. An \u201cadvice of counsel\u201d defense\u00a0typically requires the defendant to waive attorney-client privilege. Trump\u2019s lawyers told Merchan before the trial that instead of a \u201cformal\u201d defense of \u201cadvice of counsel,\u201d Trump wanted to use a different defense in which he would not waive attorney-client privilege but would\u00a0still\u00a0\u201celicit evidence concerning the presence, involvement and advice of lawyers in relevant events giving rise to the charges in the Indictment.\u201d Merchan rejected this proposal. He\u00a0wrote in March:\u00a0\u201cTo allow said defense in this matter would effectively permit Defendant to invoke the very defense he has declared he will not rely upon, without the concomitant obligations that come with it. The result would undoubtedly be to confuse and mislead the jury. This Court can not endorse such a tactic.\u201d Therefore,\u00a0Merchan ruled, Trump could not invoke or even suggest a \u201cpresence of counsel\u201d defense in the trial. Biden and the case Trump continued to declare that Biden had orchestrated the case. He said upon leaving court on Tuesday: \u201cThey have me sitting here for a Biden trial. It\u2019s a Biden trial.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0There is no basis for Trump\u2019s claim. There is no evidence that Biden has had any role in launching or running Bragg\u2019s prosecution\u00a0-\u00a0and Bragg is a locally elected official who does not report to the federal government. The\u00a0indictment\u00a0in the case was approved by a grand jury of ordinary citizens. Trump has\u00a0repeatedly invoked\u00a0a lawyer on Bragg\u2019s team, Matthew Colangelo, while making such claims; Colangelo left the Justice Department in 2022\u00a0to join the district attorney\u2019s office\u00a0as\u00a0senior counsel to Bragg. But there is no evidence that Biden had anything to do with Colangelo\u2019s employment decision. Colangelo and Bragg had been colleagues before Bragg was elected Manhattan district attorney in 2021. Before Colangelo worked at the Justice Department, he and Bragg worked at the same time in the office of New York\u2019s state attorney general, where Colangelo\u00a0investigated Trump\u2019s charity\u00a0and Trump\u2019s financial practices and was\u00a0involved in bringing various lawsuits\u00a0against the Trump administration.

{"id": "2024_05_10_politics_us-niger-forces-talks", "text": "The US is trying to negotiate an agreement with the military junta\u00a0that took over Niger last July to\u00a0leave behind a small contingent of US forces, even as a broad withdrawal order has been issued to enable the departure of the majority of\u00a0the less than 1,000\u00a0US\u00a0troops in the West African nation,\u00a0according to US officials. While some US officials have started conversations with Niger about what the withdrawal will look like, the\u00a0civilian head of US special operations told CNN this week that the Pentagon has yet to have more detailed conversations with Niger, which will largely focus more on logistics of the withdrawal. Officials said\u00a0a\u00a0US delegation will travel to Niger over the weekend to discuss\u00a0how it will be carried out. \u201cWe\u2019ll make the most out of the situation that was presented to us but the intent is in Niger, to draw down to a level that the Nigerians can live with,\u201d Chris Maier, assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict, told CNN. \u201cNiger is pretty profound in the decision of the government there \u2026 to have us depart or at least go to very low numbers,\u201d Maier said. Among the issues defense officials must resolve in their meetings with Niger\u2019s government is an agreement to allow US military flights in and out of the country. Since the coup in July, airspace has been closed over Niger to foreign militaries who have all had to submit individual requests for airspace to conduct military flights, one US official told CNN. A US military official explained that the withdrawal will come in phases over a period of months. The phase currently happening is the breakdown of anything not necessary for life or safety and security, which is being prepped to be taken out of the country. The footprint will continue to shrink in phases as equipment and personnel not deemed necessary are moved out of country. The official also said that the hope of having a small number of troops remaining in the country is largely wishful thinking at this point despite the conversations still ongoing, as Niger\u2019s government has been clear it wants US forces out. US officials said the volatile situation in Niger is just the latest signal of growing instability on the continent of Africa, where a wave of military coups over the last several years has imperiled the American presence there and offered an opportunity for Russia to grow its influence. The US military footprint in Africa is relatively small and nominally is focused on counterterrorism efforts, but officials also believe that Africa is key in the global battle for influence between Russia and the United States. Niger\u2019s military government\u00a0ended\u00a0its military agreement with the US\u00a0in\u00a0March,\u00a0and\u00a0for several months now\u00a0Russian forces have been operating in\u00a0different camps of the same base housing US troops. In addition to Niger\u2019s expulsion of US forces, Chad has threatened to cancel its status of forces agreement with the US, further destabilizing the US\u2019 presence on the continent. Although the small number of US troops in Chad makes it a less obvious military loss, a third US official said that it could be a bellwether for stability \u2014 and American influence \u2014 across the continent. Gen. Michael Langley, the head of US Africa Command,\u00a0told Congress in March\u00a0that a \u201cnumber of countries\u201d in Africa were \u201cat the tipping point of actually being captured by the Russian Federation as they are spreading some of their false narratives.\u201d\u00a0Maier echoed the same, saying Russia and China have \u201cinvested a lot more than we have\u201d in information operations, which helps spread their influence. American officials said it is difficult for the US to compete directly with what Russia is willing to offer some of the military leaders that have taken over governments in Africa. Russia can offer immediate security assistance \u2014 including weapons \u2014 in the fight against terrorism, assistance that comes with far fewer conditions than American aid. \u201cMy concern among others is that the partnership that we rely on fundamentally to, we hope, help these countries is not there anymore, or they\u2019ve replaced it in some instances with the elixir of Russia that promises things that are more rapid that might be what some of these governments, especially the coup governments, think they need in the short term,\u201d Maier said. The fear, according to the second US official, is that growing instability could create a swath of nations across Africa where the US\u00a0can\u2019t\u00a0operate safely\u00a0but Russia potentially can.\u00a0That could have dramatic security implications beyond Africa, particularly if it imperils safe US access to the Mediterranean where the US military has been operating since Hamas\u2019 invasion of Israel in October. When it comes to Africa, the US \u201cmay be in a situation where we\u2019re increasingly on the outside looking in,\u201d Maier said. But he added that it could present an opportunity to show the ineffectiveness of Russia\u2019s offers to African nations. \u201cNow some of these coup regimes have decided that they are going to go with the Russians, so now they\u2019re the dog that caught the car,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if there aren\u2019t results \u2014\u00a0not only security space, but a lot of the other things that are part of governance \u2014\u00a0then the facts will start to outstrip even the most sophisticated mis and disinformation over time.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/politics/us-niger-forces-talks/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Menendez\u2019s trial is expected to begin with jury selection on Monday.

Menendez will face a jury alongside two New Jersey businessmen who are co-defendants. His wife, Nadine,\u00a0also has been charged\u00a0but will be tried separately. The trial is scheduled to last several weeks, as prosecutors try to prove that Menendez and the businessmen, Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, engaged in a wide-ranging corruption scheme to help the Egyptian and Qatari governments in exchange for lucrative bribes.

The 1997 Flores settlement, as the agreement is known, requires the government to release children from\u00a0government\u00a0custody without unnecessary delay to sponsors, like parents or adult relatives, and dictates conditions by which children are held.

But graduating college surrounded by demonstrations and protest was a full circle moment worth cherishing. \u201cIt was in my application letter that this was a campus with a history of protests, a rich history of social justice movements,\u201d Gray said in an interview at the University of Michigan Student Union. \u201cIt was in my application letter,\u201d she repeated with a smile. \u201cI have to be proud that\u2019s the response on campus now. Although the situation is dire, and I\u2019m not remotely happy with what is going on in the world, I am impressed with how people are responding to it. And I think we should feel empowered and inspired by that.\u201d Now to the worrying part. Gray spoke to us alongside fellow new graduate Anushka Jalisatgi. They were co-presidents of the campus College Democrats and they know the pro-Gaza encampment that sprung up on campus for the final weeks of school is a sign of deep political problems for President Joe Biden in a state he likely cannot afford to lose. \u201cAll roads to the White House go through Michigan,\u201d Gray said. \u201cMichigan is up for grabs, and I did not think I would be saying this right now.

But our conversations exposed profound troubles with this group for Biden in 2024, even more so than we found in our initial visits\u00a0with these voters back in mid-November. That was just weeks after the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel; the campus activism critical of the Israeli response and Biden\u2019s handling of the crisis was just beginning. Now, that campus activism is a defining chapter for many young voters. Dampened enthusiasm for voting for Biden Summer Matkin, for example, was getting her freshman footing when we first visited her at Wayne State last November. She was home in suburban Detroit when we circled back last week. \u201cIt was stressful,\u201d she said of adjusting to her first year at college. Last fall, she raised giant concerns about the president\u2019s age but did not hesitate when asked who she would pick if the November ballot was a Biden-Trump rematch. \u201cI\u2019d go Biden,\u201d she said in that November interview at Wayne State\u2019s computer gaming lounge. This will be Matkin\u2019s first presidential vote, and she was visibly excited talking about that last fall. Still excited? \u201cQuestionable.\u201d That\u2019s because Matkin has more questions about Biden. \u201cHis age will always play a factor in how I think about him,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter how many Taylor Swift references you make, you will never understand us. But my thing is, I think he has handled everything with Israel and Palestine terribly.\u201d Matkin still leans Biden \u2014 because she cannot stomach the return of Trump to the White House. But she is part of a spirited conversation with friends. \u201cI\u2019ve considered going third party as well,\u201d Matkin said. \u201cA lot of our generation is also considering going third party. But I kind of fear it is going to split up the votes and end up having it fall back on Trump, which I wouldn\u2019t want to happen.\u201d A tepid endorsement There was some progress for Biden in our group. Wayne State student Maya Siegmann was likely Biden when we spoke in November. Certain Biden, she says now. Though her endorsement was hardly overwhelming. \u201cHis age definitely is still a barrier,\u201d Siegmann said in an interview at her suburban Detroit home. \u201cI do still think there should be an age cap on politics in general. \u2026 I would vote Biden. I think that he\u2019s the less bad option for president.\u201d She\u00a0is thrilled with her grades. But Siegmann, who is Jewish, is more thrilled this school year is over \u2014 providing a glimpse into the fear of many Jewish students from the nationwide campus unrest. \u201cIt was terrifying. It was terrifying,\u201d she said of the past semester. \u201cThe escalation on other campuses has made me fear for my campus.\u201d Wayne State was relatively calm. There were modest protests and on a couple of occasions the campus Hillel organization was locked down as a precaution when pro-Palestinian students demonstrated at the student union building where the campus Jewish organization has its offices. Siegmann told us in November she was excited to join a breakdancing club. This visit, she told us she quit because it held a fundraiser for Palestinians and she feared the money would end up going to Hamas. Siegmann said when she asked a club leader questions about the event, he blocked her phone number. It happened again, Siegmman said, when a Jewish student and former Hillel member became highly critical of Israel\u2019s response to the October 7 Hamas attacks. \u201cShe asked for unbiased proof that Hamas is trying to eradicate the Jewish people,\u201d Siegmann said. \u201cI sent her the Hamas charter. And then she blocked me.\u201d Siegmann\u2019s father is Israeli and she is spending the summer in Israel. But her unflinching support of the Jewish state is separate from her views of the Israeli government, especially Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cI personally don\u2019t agree with how he is operating,\u201d she told us. \u201cI think he is trying to prolong the war. \u2026 I think there should be a new prime minister of Israel.\u201d Eyeing third-party options Like Siegmann, Wayne State law student Ibrahim Ghazal speaks with nuance often missing when politicians discuss the conflict and the campus protests. Ghazal is of Palestinian descent and has distant relatives in Gaza. But he is no fan of Hamas and acknowledges Israel\u2019s right to respond to terrorism. \u201cWe don\u2019t want human rights violations,\u201d Ghazal told us during a break in his finals work. \u201cIf you are going to conduct war, conduct it within the rule of law, international law. That\u2019s all people are asking for. Nothing more.\u201d Our November visit was just five weeks after the October 7 Hamas attacks, and already it was clear that Biden\u2019s standing in Michigan\u2019s Arab and Muslim communities was taking a pounding. Ghazal said the president\u2019s predicament is decidedly worse now. \u201cWhat is he going to do to earn our vote?\u201d Ghazal asked. \u201cSending unconditional aid to Israel with a disregard for any of the human rights violations that have been recorded by international agencies continuously, not just denying but preventing independent probes and investigations into possible war crimes that have been committed and reported. \u201cThat\u2019s an issue. If President Biden valued Palestinian lives, valued lives in Gaza, he would definitely allow for independent probes and investigations. If Biden wants to get certain votes, he needs to change course.\u201d Ghazal said he has been too busy with school to find time but plans to research third-party presidential options over the summer. Many friends are likewise looking third party, he said. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s definitely a conversation,\u201d Ghazal said. \u201cNobody wants to vote for Biden.\u201d That sentiment was backed up in Michigan\u2019s Democratic presidential primary. Biden lost to the \u201cuncommitted\u201d option on the ballot in the three Michigan communities with the highest number of voters of Arab descent: Dearborn, Dearborn Heights and Hamtramck. But Ghazal is no fan of Trump and said he understands sitting out or voting third party could help the presumptive GOP nominee in Michigan. But he is prepared to do so if he doesn\u2019t see a major shift from Biden. \u201cThe only reason I haven\u2019t closed the door is because I think he still has an ability to change course,\u201d Ghazal said. Comparing Biden to his GOP opponent New University of Michigan graduates Jalisatgi and Gray promise to be active Biden supporters in the fall even though their College Democrats stint is over and even though they, too, have some reservations about him. Jalisatgi is going home to Missouri for the summer. Gray is already working for a Michigan progressive group. Both hope a break from campus protests and demonstrations will give younger voters time and space to see a bigger picture. \u201cTo me, there isn\u2019t another option,\u201d Gray said. \u201cBecause I\u2019m certainly not voting for the guy who is in court right now and who incited an insurrection and put three extremists on the Supreme Court who took away [abortion] rights for the first time in history. Who\u2019s demonized the LGBTQ community of which I am a part. \u2026 I know there is frustration with Biden, and some of his decisions have been inexcusable, but the reality is we need to vote for him.\u201d At the moment, though, emotions are raw. \u201cHundreds of thousands of people in Gaza and across Palestine have been displaced. Have been starved, have been killed,\u201d Jalisatgi said. \u201cSo, I think it really does come down to people\u2019s own judgments on the motivation of the president.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/politics/young-michigan-voters-biden-israel-gaza/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_11_politics_rfk-jr-debate-stage", "text": "The 2024 election cycle got a lot weirder this week when it was revealed that independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. once had a worm enter and eat part of his brain. Kennedy, who says he has recovered from the worm injuries, went on to claim that he could eat \u201c5 more brain worms and still beat\u201d former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden in a debate. Such stories and quotes might make you think that Kennedy is a sideshow this election year, but nothing could be further from the truth. A look at the polling reveals Kennedy is polling better than any independent candidate since Ross Perot in 1996, even as many of his own supporters aren\u2019t sure what he stands for. And he might do what Perot failed to do before him in 1996: make the fall debates against the major party nominees. Last week, a CNN/SSRS poll made news by painting a dire picture for Biden. He trailed Trump by 6 points in a one-on-one match-up. Trump\u2019s lead jumped to 9 points over Biden when Kennedy, Green Party candidate Jill Stein and independent Cornel West were included in the ballot test. Less publicized was that Kennedy got 16% in the survey. There wasn\u2019t a single poll that had Green Party nominee Ralph Nader in 2000 or Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson in 2016 with this level of support. This 16% is important because the polling threshold for candidates to be included in the fall presidential debates has been 15% for the past 24 years. While other polls haven\u2019t been nearly as kind to Kennedy, pretty much all of them have him hitting double-digits when he is a named option. (To make the debate stage, candidates must also appear on state ballots totaling at least 270 electoral votes. This seems more than doable for Kennedy.) The survey average will be key because Kennedy will need to be at 15% on average to make the debates. Kennedy so far has been averaging about 13% in the polls from media entities that the commission included in their 2020 average. I should point out that third party and independent candidates tend to see their polling decline over the course of the campaign. This year, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s anywhere close to a guarantee as both Biden and Trump have significantly higher negative ratings than positive ratings. That said, Kennedy is a relative unknown. An NBC News poll, which explicitly offers \u201cneutral\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d as an option, found that the plurality (39%) said either \u201cneutral\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d when voters rated Kennedy. Among those with a positive or negative opinion, 29% gave a negative one and 32% gave a positive one. This -3 point net rating was actually the best of any public figure that NBC News tested in that poll. Trump and Biden came in with -15 point and -14 point net ratings respectively. But given that 39% of voters still didn\u2019t have an opinion of Kennedy \u2013 either positive or negative \u2013 his net rating can best be described as \u201csoft\u201d. Indeed, I\u2019m not even sure his supporters or potential supporters understand his platform. Kennedy has been chastised by many for his unfounded views on vaccines and Covid-19. It was one of the first things that was written about him when he declared that he was running for president last year. A recent Monmouth University poll informed voters that Kennedy \u201csupports claims that autism is linked to vaccines and has said that Covid is targeted to attack people of certain races\u201d and asked whether they had known about these stances before taking the poll. Only 55% of voters knew about Kennedy\u2019s beliefs. More interestingly, just 27% of people who said they would definitely or probably support Kennedy indicated that they knew about these stances. The vast majority, 73%, did not. In other words, the people who were potential backers of Kennedy\u2019s didn\u2019t know what a lot of people would consider to be a key part of his position portfolio. The voters who knew most about Kennedy\u2019s positions were the ones who said they would definitely vote against him. Now, it\u2019s quite possible that Kennedy voters will stick by him the more they hear about his positions. (The Monmouth poll suggested that this was a real possibility.) For many, Kennedy may be more than his vaccine position. The fact that so few of his potential backers did know about vaccine and Covid-19 statements, however, points to the fact that he remains largely undefined. He could be more vulnerable to attack ads from opponents than the usual presidential candidate. This lines up with what we\u2019ve been seeing from Trump and his advocates: they\u2019re going after Kennedy. National polling for the most part has, after all, shown Kennedy voters prefer Trump to Biden, though not uniformly. An average of recent CNN and Quinnipiac University polls puts Trump up low double-digits in a two-way matchup among those who selected Kennedy when third party and independent candidates were included. That may not seem like a lot, and it usually wouldn\u2019t be. But in a country where elections have been so close recently, any little bit could make the difference. Don\u2019t expect Biden or Trump to allow Kennedy to surprise them. For now, Kennedy continues to be a viable option for many Americans. We\u2019ll see if it stays that way.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/politics/rfk-jr-debate-stage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_politics_bob-menendez-what-to-know-trial", "text": "A sitting US senator faces a weekslong trial over charges of taking bribes including gold bars, cash and a luxury car to, among other things, help push US aid and weapons to a foreign government and stop a federal case against one of his co-defendants. Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, who faces 16 charges including conspiracy to commit bribery and conspiracy to obstruct justice, has rejected calls to resign and, while he won\u2019t run in the state\u2019s primary for his seat, has left open the possibility for an independent run following his trial. The senator told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju on Capitol Hill last week, \u201cI am\u00a0looking forward to proving my innocence,\u201d when asked repeatedly whether he would resign in the face of a potential conviction. Prosecutors say Menendez and his wife, Nadine, helped several New Jersey businessmen \u2013 all of whom were charged in the conspiracy \u2013 obtain lucrative contracts with Egyptian and Qatari officials and attempted to pressure authorities to stop investigations into the businessmen and their associates. Jury selection in the case began Monday. The jury will be chosen from more than 100 potential jurors in federal court in New York City. The presiding judge has not yet ruled on proposed jury questionnaires. Defense attorneys have suggested asking the jury pool a myriad of questions, including whether they think someone from New Jersey is \u201cmore likely to break the law.\u201d Menendez will be tried with two of his co-defendants, Wael Hana, an Egyptian American businessman, and Fred Daibes, a New Jersey real estate developer. His wife faces trial in July. Here\u2019s what to know: Foreign entanglements According to the indictment, Hana and Nadine Menendez \u2013 who were friends for years before she started dating the senator in 2018 \u2013 worked together to connect the senator with several Egyptian officials to help secure US military aid as well as an exclusive contract with Hana\u2019s company. The contract, prosecutors say, made Hana\u2019s company the only business able to certify US food exports to Egypt as compliant with halal standards. Menendez, who at the time held senior positions on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a post with power over foreign military sales, met several times with Hana\u2019s contacts in the Egyptian military and helped steer US military sales and aid to the country, according to prosecutors. The indictment also alleges Menendez ghostwrote a letter on behalf of the Egyptian government attempting to persuade other senators to lift a hold on $300 million in aid. In addition to his alleged agreement to use his position to facilitate military sales and financing to Egypt, Menendez also passed along sensitive information to his wife about who was serving at the US Embassy in Cairo, prosecutors say. His wife, in turn, sent the information to Hana, who forwarded it to an Egyptian government official. The senator also allegedly pressured an official at the Department of Agriculture to protect the halal certification monopoly Hana had secured with Egypt for his company, through which his wife was allegedly being paid for Menendez\u2019s efforts. Menendez\u2019s entanglements with foreign governments extended to Qatari officials, prosecutors say. In exchange for gold bars, whose price Menendez searched online several times, and other items, Menendez helped his co-defendant Daibes secure a multimillion-dollar investment from Qatari officials in a real estate project, according to prosecutors. New Jersey investigations Using his power as senator, prosecutors say Menendez attempted to influence several cases in New Jersey involving his co-defendants, including by talking with a top prosecutor on one case and by working to recommend a candidate for the job of New Jersey\u2019s US attorney, who Menendez believed would help quash a case against Daibes. For Menendez\u2019s efforts in pressuring an official in one case, New Jersey businessman Jose Uribe and Hana bought Nadine a luxury car, prosecutors say. In May, Uribe pleaded guilty to seven counts related to the bribery scheme involving Menendez and his co-defendants and agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors in the case, including by testifying at the trial. Ultimately, according to the indictment, Menendez\u2019s influence campaigns were unsuccessful. The New Jersey case against Daibes is ongoing. Alleged cover-up According to prosecutors, after search warrants were executed on the Menendezes\u2019 home \u2013 where gold bars and hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash were found \u2013 and elsewhere, the senator and his wife attempted to cover up the bribes by paying back the businessmen for the mortgage and luxury car, claiming they were merely loans. The indictment states that lawyers for the two told prosecutors \u2013 relying on statements from the married couple \u2013 that the bribe payments were actually loans. Menendez allegedly had his attorney at the time say he was originally unaware of the mortgage and car payments, which prosecutors say is false. The couple has been charged with obstructing justice. Menendez\u2019s defense Attorneys for Menendez have hinted at several possible defenses they may bring during trial, including that the 13 gold bars and $480,000 in cash investigators found in his home could be explained by intergenerational family trauma as well as a psychological disorder stemming in part from his father\u2019s suicide. Shortly after he was indicted on bribery charges last year, Menendez told reporters he had withdrawn thousands of dollars in cash over the course of 30 years, citing \u201cthe history of my family facing confiscation in Cuba.\u201d The family trauma and death of his father, defense attorneys say, led to a fear of scarcity through which Menendez developed \u201cseemingly unusual\u201d coping mechanisms. Menendez may also attempt to lay the blame for the alleged conspiracy on his wife, Nadine, whose trial was delayed due to a medical issue. \u201cSenator Menendez intends to present a defense arguing (in part) that he lacked the requisite knowledge of much of the conduct and statements of his wife, Nadine, and thus lacks scienter and did not agree to join any of the charged conspiracies,\u201d attorneys for Menendez wrote in a court filing.

{"id": "2024_05_10_politics_biden-israel-gaza-war-report", "text": "The Biden administration said\u00a0Friday that\u00a0it is \u201creasonable to assess\u201d that US weapons have been used by Israeli forces in Gaza in ways that are \u201cinconsistent\u201d with international humanitarian law but\u00a0stopped short of officially saying Israel violated the law. The report which was drafted by the State Department said that investigations into potential violations are ongoing but noted that the US does \u201cnot have complete information to verify\u201d whether the US weapons \u201cwere specifically used\u201d in alleged violations of international humanitarian law. \u201cGiven the nature of the conflict in Gaza, with Hamas seeking to hide behind civilian populations and infrastructure and expose them to Israeli military action, as well as the lack of USG personnel on the ground in Gaza, it is difficult to assess or reach conclusive findings on individual incidents. Nevertheless, given Israel\u2019s significant reliance on U.S.-made defense articles, it is reasonable to assess that defense articles covered under NSM-20 have been used by Israeli security forces since October 7 in instances inconsistent with its IHL obligations or with established best practices for mitigating civilian harm,\u201d the report said. The report, which covers the period from\u00a0the outbreak of the war with Hamas\u00a0on October 7 to late April, did not find that Israel has withheld humanitarian aid to Gaza in violation of US law. Although the report does not find Israel in violation of either of the terms of the memorandum, it is sharply critical of the toll of Israel\u2019s military campaign. The findings of the report mark another stark moment in US-Israeli relations in the same week President Joe Biden threatened to restrict weapons transfers if Israel goes ahead with a major offensive in Rafah. Still, the ultimate finding that Israel\u2019s assurances made under the national security memorandum are \u201ccredible and reliable\u201d\u00a0has already raised scrutiny\u00a0among some lawmakers\u00a0and incredulity among\u00a0human rights and humanitarian organizations. The report did not mandate any actions be taken by the Israeli government, and it does not trigger any policy changes. The administration has largely avoided restricting military assistance to Israel, but in a significant shift ahead of the release of the report, Biden declared publicly in an interview with CNN this week that if Israel proceeds with a major offensive in the Gazan city, he would restrict the transfer of certain offensive weapons to Israel. The high-stakes report was declassified and transmitted to Capitol Hill on Friday afternoon. The administration was required to make a determination on those two matters under a February national security memorandum, which Biden issued under pressure from Democratic lawmakers. It was the first time the US government had to make an assessment about Israel\u2019s conduct in the seven months of the war with Hamas in Gaza, triggered by the terror group\u2019s brutal October 7 attack, that has left more than 34,000 people dead and much of the coastal enclave destroyed. \u2018Ducked all the hard questions\u2019 Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen, the driving force behind the creation of the national security memorandum, expressed disappointment in the report. \u201cThe administration ducked all the hard questions about making the actual determination,\u201d the Maryland Democrat told reporters Friday evening. \u201cI think what they\u2019re trying to do is make clear that they recognize how bad the situation is, but they don\u2019t want to have to take any action to hold the Netanyahu government accountable for what\u2019s happening.\u201d Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley, who is on the Foreign Relations Committee, agreed with Van Hollen\u2019s remarks, telling CNN that the report is \u201ca massive diplomatic dodge.\u201d \u201cOn the one hand, it says that it\u2019s very reasonable to conclude that there\u2019s been restriction of aid, it\u2019s very reasonable to conclude that our weapons have been used in violation of international law and then it proceeds to say that we just don\u2019t want to give an answer on that yet,\u201d Merkley said on \u201cErin Burnett OutFront.\u201d The Oregon Democrat is one of the few members of Congress to step foot in Rafah, visiting in January. \u201cClearly, politics come into this and strategy comes into this, but it is frustrating because it\u2019s so important at this moment that we use the leverage we have to persuade Israel to change its conduct,\u201d he said. Earlier Friday, Van Hollen also said that \u201cthe purpose of this report was not to provide a snapshot in time\u201d and accused the administration of taking Israel\u2019s assurances at \u201cface value,\u201d despite investigations by human rights groups finding violations of the law. However, a senior State Department official said that it was always intended to be retrospective, and that there are processes underway to evaluate ongoing activity. There is no deadline for any conclusions to be made under those processes. The report notes that \u201cin any conflict involving foreign partners, it is often difficult to make swift, definitive assessments or determinations on whether specific U.S. defense articles or services have been used in a manner not consistent with international law.\u201d \u201cHowever, there have been sufficient reported incidents to raise serious concerns,\u201d it said. \u201cWhile Israel has the knowledge, experience, and tools to implement best practices for mitigating civilian harm in its military operations, the results on the ground, including high levels of civilian casualties, raise substantial questions as to whether the IDF is using them effectively in all cases,\u201d the report said. According to the senior State Department official, the compilation of the report has been a useful tool for the Biden administration to go to the government of Israel and insist on getting information, and on behavior changes. That official said the report would be shared with the Israeli government. Biden administration officials have for months called on Israel to do more to curb the civilian death toll and allow more aid into Gaza.\u00a0On humanitarian aid, the report notes the US government \u201chas had deep concerns during the period since October 7 about action and inaction by Israel that contributed significantly to a lack of sustained and predictable delivery of needed assistance at scale, and the overall level reaching Palestinian civilians \u2013 while improved \u2013 remains insufficient.\u201d However, it states that they \u201cdo not currently assess that the Israeli government is prohibiting or otherwise restricting the transport or delivery of U.S. humanitarian assistance within the meaning of section 620I of the Foreign Assistance Act,\u201d which bars assistance to governments found to be intentionally restricting aid. The report calls the \u201cthe impact of Israel\u2019s military operations on humanitarian actors\u201d a specific area of concern, citing a series of incidents, including the deadly strike on a World Central Kitchen aid convoy. Following that strike last month, Biden warned Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu in a call that Israel had to do more to address the humanitarian situation or there would be a change in US policy. In recent weeks, US officials said Israel had taken important measures following that conversation, but that more still needed to be done. However, following the launch of \u201climited\u201d Israeli military operations in Rafah, where millions of Palestinians have fled, humanitarian aid access has once again plummeted. Intense debate The report was the subject of intense debate for months across the administration. Human rights organizations have assessed that Israel\u2019s military campaign has violated humanitarian law. Late last month, Amnesty International assessed that US-supplied weapons to Israel have been used \u201cin serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, and in a manner that is inconsistent with US law and policy.\u201d An Amnesty International official said Friday that \u201cthis report seems like the international version of \u2018thoughts and prayers\u2019: admitting there\u2019s a problem but not doing anything meaningful to prevent the further loss of lives.\u201d \u201cDespite President Biden\u2019s vague comments earlier this week, his administration today made its position loud and clear: it points fingers and takes swift action when an actor the US government considers an adversary violates international law, but treats the government of Israel as above the law, even while\u00a0acknowledging the overwhelming evidence that Israeli forces are violating international law and killing Palestinian civilians with US weapons on US taxpayer dime,\u201d said Amanda Klasing, National Director of Government Relations and Advocacy at Amnesty International USA. Van Hollen on Friday said that \u201cit is not credible that the US government has less information than organizations like Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Oxfam.\u201d A senior State Department official said they couldn\u2019t speak to the standards for the assessments made by those organizations but said the US government process was very diligent and took into consideration any accountability measures undertaken by the Israeli government. The president also acknowledged to CNN that \u201ccivilians have been killed as a consequence of\u201d US-supplied bombs. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller on Thursday said Biden was speaking to \u201cthe tragic loss of civilian life throughout this conflict,\u201d not a legal determination under international humanitarian law. Humanitarian aid organizations also questioned the findings of the report. \u201cWe are confused and dismayed by the Biden administration\u2019s report to Congress, and in particular, its findings that Israel is not impeding the provision of aid to Gaza,\u201d said\u00a0Kate Phillips-Barrasso, vice president of global policy and advocacy at Mercy Corps. \u201cHumanitarian organizations have publicly and repeatedly detailed a litany of obstructions by Israel over the last seven months that have made it impossible to deliver humanitarian assistance to the 2.2 million people in Gaza whose lives depend on it,\u201d she said. \u201cYet more compelling than the testimony of aid organizations is the horrifying situation of the population of Gaza, trapped in a conflict zone and facing starvation,\u201d she continued. \u201cIf humanitarian aid were being adequately facilitated\u2014as the NSM calls for\u20141.1 million people would not be facing catastrophic famine conditions a few miles away from available food. The very fact that the US government has airdropped assistance and spent significant effort and resources constructing a floating pier for maritime deliveries indicates officials had already come to the conclusion that aid delivery was being \u2018directly or indirectly\u2019 impeded.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/politics/biden-israel-gaza-war-report/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_politics_biden-challenges-2024-analysis", "text": "If Joe Biden wins a second term later this year, he will have defied one of the most complex political environments for a president seeking reelection in years. At home and abroad, he is facing the kind of headwinds that would normally cast severe doubt on his chances of convincing voters that they should send him back to the White House. Biden\u2019s difficult dynamic was on show in an exclusive interview with CNN this week, in the swing state of Wisconsin, which he only won by around 20,000 votes in 2020 and that could be decisive again in November. The president is facing wars in the Middle East and Ukraine that carry a constant threat of escalation and repeatedly throw up challenges to his credibility as a leader. At home, Biden is beset by campus protests triggered by the Israeli offensive in Gaza and a revolt by some progressive and young voters vital to his coalition. More broadly, the electorate isn\u2019t yet buying his \u201cmorning in America\u201d vibe. They\u2019re suffering from high prices and interest rates that confound his reassurances that the economy is in great shape and mask a strong legislative record that stands comparison with any recent president. Then there\u2019s the challenge of being the oldest president in history, running for a second term that would end when he is 86. Biden\u2019s saving grace, however, may be that Donald Trump \u2013 his opponent in a 2020 election rematch that Americans have repeatedly told pollsters they don\u2019t want \u2013 may be saddled with even more vulnerabilities than he is. Trump spent this week in a Manhattan court listening to embarrassing testimony about an alleged liaison he had with an adult film star in 2006 that is now at the center of a hush money trial. New York prosecutors claim he falsified business records to hide a payment to Stormy Daniels in an early act of election interference in 2016. He\u2019s denied the affair and pleaded not guilty in the case. Trump also has a habit of alienating the key suburban voters likely to decide which of the two one-term presidents wins a second mandate in November. His recent warnings that he couldn\u2019t rule out violence after the 2024 election, and his refusal to say he\u2019d accept the result, revived dark memories of his attempt to steal the 2020 election and underscored his fundamental threat to democracy. Trump\u2019s base voters have no problems either with his criminal trials or his false claims that he was cheated out of office. But the most recent midterm and presidential elections suggest that he does scare off large sectors of the general electorate. Trump has also talked himself into a difficult corner on abortion \u2013 one of the few issues where Biden outpolls him and which Democrats believe could enthuse their voters and produce the kind of turnout that could swamp the ex-president in November. Trump\u2019s role in building a generational conservative majority on the Supreme Court is coming back to haunt him after the justices overturned the constitutional right to an abortion. While Trump insists the issue must be left to the states, it\u2019s offering Democrats an opening every time a Republican legislature or conservative court delivers an extreme new anti-abortion measure or decision. Israel may be far from the biggest worry for Trump\u2019s campaign Polls consistently show that voters care most about the economy. And the president\u2019s ratings on the issue are underwater. A CNN poll in April showed that Biden had a 34% rating on the economy \u2014 and 29% on inflation \u2014 as voters say economic concerns are more important to them when choosing a candidate than they were in each of the past two presidential elections. And voters who say the economy is very important to their vote backed Trump over Biden 62% to 30%. This deficit for the president comes despite three years of solid growth and job creation numbers. But inflation, a corrosive political force that can ruin political careers and that only voters who remember the early 1980s have experienced before, has bequeathed a period of high interest rates. This is proving punishing to home and car buyers, for instance. And many Americans still get a shock every time they go to the grocery store. In his interview with CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett, the president pushed back on the notion that the economy is in poor shape while expressing some understanding for the pain caused by high prices. But he was still defensive on the issue \u2014 recalling some previous presidents who appeared irked that voters weren\u2019t appreciating their efforts. Asked by Burnett when he would restore consumer confidence, Biden replied: \u201cWe have already turned it around,\u201d then added, \u201cThe polling data has been wrong all along. You guys do a poll at CNN. How many folks you have to call to get one response? The idea that we\u2019re in a situation where things are so bad \u2026 we have created more jobs. We have made \u2013 we\u2019re in a situation where people have access to good-paying jobs.\u201d Biden has also balked at Trump\u2019s efforts to conjure nostalgia for the economy in his first term \u2013 before jobs and growth went into free fall during a once-in-a-century pandemic. \u201cLet me say it this way, when I started this administration, people were saying there\u2019s going to be a collapse of the economy. We have the strongest economy in the world. Let me say it again, in the world,\u201d the president said. But telling voters things are great when they don\u2019t feel they are is a questionable political strategy. Any time a president looks like he isn\u2019t fully in touch with the reality of voters\u2019 lives, he\u2019s on dangerous ground. In 1992, for instance, President George H.W. Bush was running for reelection. He was asked in a campaign debate, \u201cHow can you find a cure for the economic problems of the common people if you have no experience of what is ailing them?\u201d Bush got off to a bad start by looking at his watch, making it look like he\u2019d rather be anywhere else in the world. He then offered a halting and confusing answer that ended with: \u201cOf course you feel it when you are president of the United States and that is why I am trying to do something about it.\u201d His rival, Bill Clinton, then stood up and gave a national audience a taste of his burning \u201cfeel your pain\u201d political talent. He directly addressed the questioner, said that as Arkansas governor he knew by name many people who lost their jobs, and told the nation: \u201cThis decision better be about what kind of economic theory you want. Not just people saying I want to go fix it.\u201d A few months later, Clinton was in the White House. Biden has more time than Bush to convince voters that better economic times are ahead, and he\u2019d be considerably helped if the Federal Reserve begins to ease rates in the summer. He\u2019s been contrasting his own humble origins with Trump\u2019s billionaire lifestyle in recent weeks, trying to puncture the idea that the ex-president cares more about working Americans than he does, while warning his predecessor would destroy the Affordable Care Act if he gets back in the Oval Office. \u201cI look at it from a position \u2013 not being facetious \u2013 from a Scranton perspective,\u201d Biden told Burnett. \u201cHe looks at it from a Mar-a-Lago perspective. He wants to give more significant tax cuts to the super wealthy.\u201d And Biden is fortunate in that he faces a rival with his own massive liabilities, rather than a young rising star with a gift for coining a middle-class economic narrative like Clinton. Biden\u2019s path becomes even more complex But if anything, the president\u2019s path to reelection is becoming even more complicated.\u00a0He\u2019s now locked in a showdown with the prime minister of Israel \u2014 always a treacherous proposition for US leaders. This crisis risks playing into Trump\u2019s contention that the world and the nation is spinning out of control and needs a strongman to fix it. The fracture with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu occurred after the president warned in the CNN interview that he would halt the transfer of some weapons to Israel if it went ahead with a major offensive into the Gazan city of Rafah. Biden has been under enormous pressure from progressive activists, supporters on Capitol Hill and Arab American voters in the key swing state of Michigan to rein in Netanyahu after the deaths of many thousands of Palestinian civilians in Israel\u2019s war against Hamas following the October 7 terror attacks that killed 1,200 people. Campus protests have, meanwhile, caught Biden between young and progressive voters who are furious with his support for Israel in the war, and moderates who might be susceptible to his predecessor\u2019s chaos narrative. It\u2019s not clear that heated Republicans attacks on Biden over Israel Thursday will seriously wound him with his own voters. But the tone of the criticism bolstered a wider Republican narrative that Biden is weak and incapable of stabilizing an increasingly restless world. \u201cThat\u2019s a failure of leadership. That is cowardice, that is answering, trying to make a political calculus here that it helps him get out from underwater,\u201d Republican Sen. Thom Tillis said. The North Carolinian\u2019s colleague from Missouri, GOP Sen. Josh Hawley, added: \u201cThis is the message to our allies that, you know, if it\u2019s politically inconvenient for the president to send you arms then, you know, sorry, you\u2019re on your own.\u201d Biden has tried to insulate himself from the political impact of the protests with centrist voters by arguing that while the right to demonstrate is constitutionally guaranteed, any property damage from students occupying college buildings is unacceptable. And in a speech on Capitol Hill memorializing victims of the Holocaust earlier this week, he condemned examples of antisemitism reported at some of the protests. He warned that too many people were \u201cdenying, downplaying, rationalizing and ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust and October 7.\u201d Still, polls show that the Israel-Hamas conflict is well down the list of issues that most concern voters \u2014 including the young voters most often cited as deserting Biden in droves over the conflict. But in an election that could come down to thousands of votes in a few states, the potential for defections or no shows from angry Democratic voters is an alarming one for the president.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/politics/biden-challenges-2024-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_politics_donald-trump-trial-analysis", "text": "Donald Trump is heading into the most perilous phase of his hush money trial aside from the moment when the jury retires to consider its verdict. Former adult film star Stormy Daniels is back on the stand on Thursday to continue what has been at times explicit and cringe-worth testimony about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump nearly two decades ago, which set off a winding chain of events that led to the first criminal trial of an ex-president. Her evidence on Tuesday was deeply embarrassing for Trump and drew an aggressive cross-examination from his attorney trying to shatter Daniels\u2019 credibility. Trump spent Wednesday, the trial\u2019s off day, at home in Florida. He will return deeply at odds with Judge Juan Merchan, who had earlier threatened him with jail if he again infringes a gag order he has already flouted 10 times. Merchan also instructed Trump\u2019s attorney, Todd Blanche, to rein in his client after complaining that the defendant had cursed audibly and shaken his head during Daniels\u2019 testimony. The judge was concerned that the jury might notice the witness being intimidated \u2014 which he warned he could not allow to continue. So far, Trump \u2014 who has launched searing attacks on the judge \u2014 has managed to refrain from openly attacking Daniels since she took the stand. But her continued testimony will test him further. And her appearance is only an appetizer for expected explosive evidence in the coming days of the biggest star witness, Trump\u2019s former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen. His testimony is likely to be far more germane to the underling charges that Trump falsified business records to cover up a hush money payment to buy Daniels\u2019 silence about the liaison she described on Tuesday. Trump denies the affair and has pleaded not guilty in the case. Cohen at the epicenter of Trump\u2019s world Cohen \u2014 a colorful figure in his own right who often tried to replicate his boss\u2019 bravado, once saying he\u2019d \u201ctake a bullet\u201d for Trump \u2014 facilitated the $130,000 payment to Daniels. The ex-president, who now views Cohen as a traitor, has spent months seeking to destroy his usefulness as a witness by highlighting time he spent in jail for what a judge once called \u201ca veritable smorgasbord of fraudulent conduct.\u201d Daniels\u2019 testimony and a coming appearance from Cohen could amount to a forensic excavation of Trump\u2019s past life that he\u2019d much rather never saw the light of day \u2014 and the hush money payment he made before the 2016 election is proof of that. Now it\u2019s bubbling up years after the alleged transgressions took place during a new White House campaign. The coming days will therefore require qualities that Trump has always struggled to demonstrate in a riotous life in business and politics: restraint and self-discipline. Any behavior that could be construed as witness intimidation, or an attempt to influence the jury on social media or in the courtroom, could push Merchan over the red line he established earlier this week. The judge told Trump he didn\u2019t want to slap him with jail time, which could be as limited as a matter of hours, but if he had to act to protect the integrity of the trial, he would. Sarah Matthews, a former Trump White House deputy press secretary, told CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta on Wednesday that the former president\u2019s mood would be brittle following his ordeal in court on Tuesday. \u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t want to be working on his campaign team or be one of his attorneys right now, just given, I think, that he\u2019s more than certainly lashing out at them. He\u2019s upset after that testimony,\u201d Matthews said. Yet Matthews argued that Trump could temper his reactions in public for fear of the consequences \u2014 even if he says he\u2019s willing to spend time behind bars to bolster his campaign narrative that he\u2019s a persecuted political dissident. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll see Donald Trump break the gag order again. Look, he\u2019s a germaphobe,\u201d Matthews said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he wants to go to jail, honestly. \u2026 I don\u2019t think that it will ultimately come to that. I think he\u2019ll push it up until the edge.\u201d Trump has a history of digging himself into deeper legal holes Cohen\u2019s time on the stand could be especially excruciating for the former president. While Daniels\u2019 account of their alleged encounter in a hotel suite in Lake Tahoe in 2006 was painfully embarrassing, she is not regarded as holding the key to the case against him. Prosecutors drew out her story because it was necessary to explain to the jury why Trump was so keen to hide it with a cash payoff before the 2016 election, which they allege was an attempt to mislead voters and interfere in a federal election. But Cohen is the most critical pillar of the entire case \u2014 his actions and knowledge get directly to the question of whether the former president knowingly falsified business records in a way that the prosecution can prove to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. He can therefore be expected to face an even more withering cross-examination from Trump\u2019s legal team than Daniels did. Indeed, dismantling his evidence represents Trump\u2019s best hope of introducing doubt into the minds of one or more jurors that could lead to an acquittal. Trump\u2019s hair trigger temper is often activated when he feels he\u2019s being unfairly attacked. And his life\u2019s creed dictates that when he\u2019s hit hard, he hits back harder. His acting out was especially acute during the civil fraud trial targeting him, his adult sons and the Trump Organization that ended in a near half-billion-dollar judgment against them. His histrionics peaked with extraordinary testimony in his own defense that at times seemed more like a campaign stunt than a somber court proceeding. He constantly trampled court decorum and drove Judge Arthur Engoron to once plead with Trump\u2019s lawyer, \u201cI beseech you to control him if you can.\u201d While Trump wasn\u2019t sanctioned, the judge alluded to the former president\u2019s contempt for the case and the rule of law when detailing the massive fraud that was designed to get Trump more favorable treatment from financial institutions. Engoron said of Trump and his sons that \u201ctheir complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological.\u201d In yet another case, Trump\u2019s continued attacks on the writer E. Jean Carroll after a defamation trial factored into the size of an $83 million finding against him. The parallels are not exact in Trump\u2019s first criminal trial. Trump is not on the stand, so he has less opportunity to challenge Merchan\u2019s authority over the court. (Many legal experts believe any attempt by Trump to honor his vows to testify in his own defense would be a legal blunder of huge proportions). At the same time, however, the presence of a jury in this case means he has even less latitude to misbehave, especially after Merchan\u2019s two warnings put him on even thinner ice. A former president who built a personal brand on always being the most dominant figure in the room has been slow to learn that his displays of contempt in the courtroom keep getting him in trouble. The coming days of the hush money trial will show whether that has changed.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/politics/donald-trump-trial-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_politics_michael-cohen-donald-trump-analysis", "text": "Michael Cohen once described himself as Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cspokesman, thug, pit bull and lawless lawyer.\u201d But this week, he has a new role. He will be the star witness for prosecutors trying to prove Trump illegally falsified business records after paying off adult film actress Stormy Daniels as part of an alleged election interference scheme in 2016. Cohen\u2019s testimony is set to be the critical moment of the hush money trial that could make Trump the first ex-president to be convicted of a crime. His appearance will mark the zenith of a bitter personal feud between two brash New Yorkers obsessed with betrayal and revenge. And it marks one of the most lurid twists yet in the presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s legal morass that is entwined with the 2024 election. Trump\u2019s former fixer wrote in his autobiography that he craved reflected influence and notoriety from Trump, so he adopted the real estate magnate\u2019s methods \u2014 including bullying, lying and mocking the rule of law \u2014 to serve him. He once vowed to take a bullet for his boss. But his testimony will be his latest attempt to atone for this Faustian pact after he paid the price, including with a spell in prison, for his years as a kingpin in Trump\u2019s orbit. In many ways, Cohen is the mirror image of Trump \u2014 a colorful braggart and social media provocateur who craved power and riches and was prepared to pay any price and to intimidate anyone to get them. Cohen, who worked for the Trump Organization cleaning up the mess from the family\u2019s personal scandals and busted business deals, facilitated the $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels, he says, on the orders of his boss. Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels, whose testimony last week about their alleged liaison at Lake Tahoe in 2006 seemed excruciating for the ex-president. He has pleaded not guilty in this case and to three other criminal indictments. Cohen\u2019s value as a witness is that he was involved in every aspect of Trump\u2019s business and personal life, knew all his secrets, and was allegedly an accessory in his efforts to break the law and thwart accountability. In his book \u201cDisloyal,\u201d Cohen wrote, \u201cI know where the skeletons are buried because I was the one who buried them.\u201d Prosecutor Matthew Colangelo said in his opening statement that \u201cCohen made that payment at the defendant\u2019s direction, and he did it to influence the presidential election.\u201d After the election, Trump is accused of working out a scheme in the Oval Office to reimburse Cohen for the hush money payment in installments disguised as billing for legal services. \u201cThe defendant falsified those business records because he wanted to conceal his and others\u2019 criminal conduct,\u201d Colangelo said, adding that both Cohen and the prosecution will be up-front about mistakes Cohen has made in the past. Cohen\u2019s friend and fellow former Trump acolyte Anthony Scaramucci, who briefly served as the ex-president\u2019s White House communications director, said the former fixer will be able to prove the criminality of campaign interference. \u201cI think unfortunately for Donald Trump, Michael Cohen has the receipts for everything that went on,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper  on Friday. \u201cThey\u2019re smoking gun receipts, and he\u2019s going to provide very compelling, very honest, very direct testimony.\u201d How Trump\u2019s legal team will seek to discredit Cohen But like Trump, Cohen has a long history of trashing the truth, and since turning on his onetime mentor, he has sought to monetize his campaign against him with books \u2013 including one called \u201cRevenge\u201d \u2013 podcasts and television appearances. He is, therefore, vulnerable to a savage cross-examination by Trump\u2019s attorneys, who will lambast him as an unreliable witness on a quest for payback as they seek to sow reasonable doubt over Trump\u2019s culpability in the mind of at least one juror. Trump\u2019s attorneys will argue that his payments to Cohen were a legal retainer and that paying someone to stop what they say are unfounded rumors about the ex-president is not illegal. In his opening statement, Trump lawyer Todd Blanche suggested Cohen sought revenge because he was not given a job in the new president\u2019s administration in 2017. He also accused Cohen of an unhealthy obsession with Trump. \u201cHe criticizes President Trump. He has talked extensively about his desire to see President Trump go to prison. He has talked extensively about his desire to see President Trump\u2019s family go to prison. He has talked extensively about President Trump getting convicted in this case,\u201d Blanche said. Trump\u2019s former fixer was sent to prison after pleading guilty to lying to Congress about a possible Trump business project in Russia, for orchestrating illegal campaign contributions in the form of hush money payments and on various tax evasion charges. How prosecutors built a foundation under Cohen\u2019s testimony This issue of credibility is why prosecutors have spent days building a foundation for Cohen\u2019s testimony, taking jurors through inner workings of the Trump Organization including with bank records, text messages and evidence from the firm\u2019s former employees as they seek to prove 34 counts that allege Trump falsified financial records to hide the hush money payments. The testimony from Daniels was designed to illustrate the incident Trump allegedly tried to keep from voters in his successful White House campaign eight years ago. Former Nixon White House counsel John Dean said on \u201cCNN Newsroom\u201d on Saturday that the government case against Trump was \u201cvery powerful\u201d and that \u201cthey have built such a structure that Michael Cohen can come in and testify and he is largely corroborated already.\u201d Cohen has tried to counter defense claims that he has ulterior motives for seeking vengeance against Trump by styling his decision to flip on the former president as a quest for redemption and an attempt to warn the public about the danger Trump poses if he is elected in November. At a dramatic congressional hearing in 2019, Cohen painted a stunning portrait of the mob-like world in which his former boss did business and said that \u201cmy loyalty to Mr. Trump has cost me everything.\u201d He testified that everything he did \u2014 from organizing the suppression of tabloid news stories unflattering to Trump, to bullying business rivals and closing deals \u2014 was in the service of one thing: \u201cEverybody\u2019s job at the Trump Organization is to protect Mr. Trump,\u201d he said, adding that he had been directed by his boss to threaten people more than 500 times. \u201cI am ashamed because I know what Mr. Trump is. He is a racist. He is a conman. He is a cheat,\u201d Cohen said. The Trump worshipper-turned-enemy was a small-time lawyer and businessman who made his fortune in New York taxi medallions before he came to the future president\u2019s attention when he was looking for an enforcer along the lines of the late and notorious New York lawyer Roy Cohn. Trump, who will sit just feet away from his former henchman in the courtroom this week, has been equally unflattering about Cohen. He\u2019s spent months lacerating his former lawyer\u2019s character on social media. And Cohen\u2019s appearance on the witness stand will likely prove one of the biggest tests of Trump\u2019s capacity to avoid infringing the gag order protecting key witnesses and court staff that he has already been fined $10,000 for violating 10 times. Last week, Judge Juan Merchan directly warned Trump that future violations could force him to impose jail time. It will not be the first time the two former partners meet in court. Cohen was a key witness in Trump\u2019s civil fraud trial in New York last fall that resulted in a near half-billion-dollar judgment against the ex-president, his adult sons and the Trump Organization. In what Cohen described as a \u201check of a reunion,\u201d he testified that he manipulated Trump\u2019s financial statements to \u201creverse-engineer\u201d them to hit an arbitrary net wealth figure in a key moment in the prosecution case. He also sparred heatedly with Trump\u2019s lawyers, who tried to discredit him in cross-examination in a way that underscores the risk prosecutors will take putting him on the stand in the hush money trial \u2014 which, unlike the civil fraud case, is being heard by a jury. It is becoming clearer that this trial \u2014 seen by legal experts as the weakest criminal threat facing the former president \u2014 may be the only one to go to a jury before November\u2019s election. The three other cases are all effectively on hold. The Supreme Court is deliberating the former president\u2019s sweeping immunity claims arising from his federal election interference indictment, and a Trump-appointed judge in Florida has postponed his classified documents trial after dragging her feet on adjudicating pretrial motions and disputes. The election interference case in Florida has become mired in a controversy over whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis should be disqualified from the case. While the hush money trial harks back to the 2016 election, its end game could play a significant role in the destiny of the White House eight years later. There is no clear sign yet that proceedings have had any impact on Trump\u2019s standing in the race after he brandished his indictments to bolster his claims that he\u2019s the victim of election interference himself. This helped him crush the GOP primary field, and some polls suggest that some Republicans could think twice about voting for him in a neck-and-neck race with President Joe Biden if he\u2019s a convicted felon. But the ex-president would be sure to use any acquittal to argue that all of the cases against him are equally meritless. Cohen\u2019s testimony, therefore, may have consequences far beyond the courtroom.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/politics/michael-cohen-donald-trump-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}

In one comment, Palma dismissed suggestions from then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that Trump was to blame for violence at the Capitol. \u201cActually the fault lies with the rigged election. Genius,\u201d she\u00a0wrote\u00a0the day after the riot. There is no indication Palma went to the Capitol or was violent on January 6, but tweets from that day show her in DC for Trump\u2019s rally. Palma later dismissed that day\u2019s violence as the work of a few attendees. \u201cJan 6 was not a riot. A small group of people were trouble. It was 99.9 peaceful, respectful. I was there,\u201d\u00a0she wrote. CNN reviewed Palma\u2019s now-private tweets on the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, where\u00a0she included the hashtag #BidenCheated 86 times from November 2020 to February 2021. Palma\u2019s promotion and attendance at \u201cStop the Steal\u201d events after the 2020 election reflects a segment of support Kennedy has received from Trump supporters, particularly as a means of helping the former president retake the White House in 2024. One of the\u00a0biggest donors\u00a0to Kennedy\u2019s super PAC, Timothy Mellon, is also a major donor to Trump. And polls have suggested Kennedy could take critical votes away from Biden. CNN\u00a0was first to report\u00a0that Palma told a gathering of New York state Republicans that efforts to put Kennedy on the ballot in New York would help \u201cget rid of Biden,\u201d which she called her \u201cNo. 1 priority.\u201d \u201cThe only way that Trump can even, remote possibility of taking New York is if Bobby is on the ballot. If it\u2019s Trump vs. Biden, Biden wins. Biden wins six days, seven days a week. With Bobby in the mix, anything can happen,\u201d Palma said in a video of the meeting viewed by CNN. \u201cThe only way for him, for Bobby, to shake it up and to get rid of Biden is if he\u2019s on the ballot in every state, including New York,\u201d she continued. The Kennedy campaign has since distanced itself from Palma. Amaryllis Fox,\u00a0Kennedy\u2019s campaign director, said in a statement posted on X that Palma was hired by the campaign as a ballot-access consultant and that she doesn\u2019t shape electoral strategy, adding that Palma\u2019s remarks in a circulated video were made as a private citizen. Palma did not respond to a CNN request for comment\u00a0but on Tuesday afternoon posted to her Facebook page: \u201cWow- look at that news cycle. I guess the MSM doesn\u2019t like little ole me exercising my 1A rights? Hi, CNN!\u201d Tweets dating to November 2020 show Palma repeatedly volunteering to go to and attending numerous pro-Trump rallies and events \u2013\u00a0even tweeting at\u00a0\u201cStop the Steal\u201d organizer Ali Alexander she would go to Georgia for a week as the state was recounting votes. \u201cWe are rooting for you\u00a0@realDonaldTrump\u00a0Bigly. YUGE rooting. Biggest fan club EVER. #WeLoveYou\u00a0#BestPresidentEver45\u00a0\u00a0#FourMoreYears,\u201d she wrote on November 19, 2020. Palma also\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0expressed\u00a0an affinity for Powell, one of Trump\u2019s election lawyers who\u00a0promoted\u00a0unhinged conspiracy theories\u00a0about nationwide vote-rigging and who filed meritless lawsuits to overturn the results. \u201cYou were born/ chosen for this fight and you will win, win, win. WE LOVE YOU, TOO!\u201d she\u00a0tweeted at\u00a0Powell. In another\u00a0tweet on December 11, 2020,\u00a0Palma called Powell \u201cMY PERSON OF THE DECADE!!\u201d and posted a photo of the pair at the former Trump International Hotel in DC. Last year, Powell\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0in the Georgia election subversion case, in which Trump and a host of co-defendants are accused of orchestrating a broad conspiracy aimed at overturning Biden\u2019s 2020 electoral win in the state. It appears that Palma was in DC to attend the \u201cMillion MAGA March\u201d on December 12, 2020, as she\u00a0posted\u00a0photos on Twitter driving to the rally and posted on the day of the rally. \u201c#MAGAMillionMarch\u00a0 #MAGA #TrumpWon #BidenCheated #46DoesNotExist,\u201d\u00a0she wrote. In late December, Palma\u00a0tweeted\u00a0she would attend the January 6, 2021, \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally,\u00a0writing\u00a0in two tweets, \u201cI got my hotel room!\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll be there in Jan 6th #FightforTrump #Jan6.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/09/politics/rfk-jr-campaign-official-january-6-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_12_politics_michael-cohen-trump-hush-money", "text": "Nobody has anything nice to say about Michael Cohen. Donald Trump\u2019s former fixer and lawyer is expected to take the stand Monday as the key witness in the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s case against\u00a0the\u00a0former president, prepared to give testimony connecting to Trump the $130,000 hush money payment Cohen made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. Through three weeks of testimony, jurors have already heard plenty about Cohen through numerous witnesses, who have painted an unflattering portrait of an aggressive, impulsive and unlikeable attorney. David Pecker, former head of National Enquirer parent company American Media Inc., said Cohen was \u201cprone to exaggeration.\u201d\u00a0Former Trump aide\u00a0Hope Hicks said Cohen liked to call himself a \u201cfixer\u201d\u00a0\u2013 a role she said was possible only because \u201che first broke it.\u201d\u00a0And Daniels\u2019\u00a0former\u00a0attorney Keith Davidson said he only worked with Cohen because he was a \u201cjerk\u201d whom Daniels\u2019 then-manager Gina Rodriguez \u2013 along with everyone else \u2013 didn\u2019t want to deal with. \u201cGina called me up to tell me that: \u2018Some jerk called me and was very, very aggressive and threatened to sue me. And I, um, would like you, Keith, to call this jerk back,\u2019\u201d\u00a0Davidson testified in the third week of the trial. \u201cI hate to ask it this way, but who was that jerk?\u201d asked Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass. \u201cIt was Michael Cohen,\u201d Davidson responded. Now\u00a0Cohen\u00a0is the witness whom prosecutors are relying on to deliver testimony that can help them prove Trump\u00a0falsified\u00a0business records when he\u00a0allegedly\u00a0reimbursed\u00a0Cohen for the $130,000\u00a0to Daniels\u00a0to keep her from going public about a past encounter ahead of\u00a0the 2016 election. Trump has pleaded not guilty\u00a0and denied the affair. Cohen is the only witness who will testify about Trump\u2019s alleged involvement in both the decision to pay Daniels and the plan to reimburse Cohen for advancing the money. Cohen will likely serve as the narrator for the prosecution and take the jury from the initial meeting in which Pecker, Cohen and Trump allegedly agreed to buy negative stories that could hurt Trump\u2019s presidential run to the payment made to Daniels just days before Election Day to an Oval Office meeting in February 2017, just weeks after Trump was sworn in. Prosecutors allege that during the February meeting, Trump and Cohen agreed how Cohen would be paid back. That arrangement, prosecutors say, included a false story that Cohen was working under a retainer agreement.\u00a0The paperwork, from the invoices\u00a0and\u00a0general ledger entries\u00a0to the\u00a0checks signed by Trump,\u00a0make up the 34 criminal charges in the case. Witnesses who come with \u2018baggage\u2019 Prosecutors have waited to call Cohen until the end of their case, after introducing phone records, emails, text messages and bank records that they hope bolster his credibility with the jury. They have not tried to hide from the jury that he and other witnesses have plenty of problems. \u201cWe are going to be very up-front about the fact that several of the witnesses in this case have what you made might consider to be some baggage,\u201d Steinglass told a panel of prospective jurors during jury selection. The testimony will pit Trump against Cohen, who once said he would take a bullet for the former president. They last saw each other when Cohen testified in Trump\u2019s New York civil fraud trial last fall. Cohen\u2019s testimony was brief, but the showdown was tense. This\u00a0week the stakes are higher,\u00a0with a potential criminal conviction and possible jail sentence\u00a0on the line for Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. It brings to a close a long journey for Cohen, who is still aggrieved that he served three years in prison\u00a0and home confinement\u00a0after pleading guilty to federal campaign finance charges related to the payoff, among other crimes. Cohen met with prosecutors more than a dozen times and testified before the grand jury in the hush money trial. He has immunity on state charges for his role in the alleged conspiracy. He will also face blistering cross-examination by Trump attorney Todd Blanche. The former president\u2019s lawyers are expected to hammer at Cohen\u2019s credibility, including digging into his past, and suggest to the jury that Trump had no idea what deal Cohen struck or how it was recorded on the books of his company. \u201cEven before he takes the stand, Cohen has been attacked and undermined by the prosecution\u2019s own witnesses. On one hand, he could be damaged goods before he takes the stand. But he also might benefit from low expectations if the jury finds him to be better than advertised,\u201d said Elie Honig, a CNN senior legal analyst and former state and federal prosecutor. After jail sentence,\u00a0Cohen released\u00a0books and\u00a0podcast\u00a0attacking Trump The charges filed against Trump date to events that transpired during the 2016 election. But in many ways, the case against Trump\u00a0stems from his\u00a0former fixer\u2019s decision to plead guilty in 2018 in federal court to two counts of making unlawful campaign contributions in violation of federal campaign finance laws. He implicated Trump directly in the scheme and admitted that he orchestrated to pay Daniels on Trump\u2019s behalf. Cohen also pleaded guilty to tax charges and to lying to Congress about Trump\u2019s business venture to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison, which he served behind bars and under house arrest. Cohen\u2019s plea prompted the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office to launch the investigation surrounding the hush money payments that led to Trump\u2019s indictment\u00a0last year. Cohen became dedicated to antagonizing Trump. He published two books, \u201cDisloyal\u201d in 2020 and \u201cRevenge\u201d in 2022, and launched a podcast, \u201cMea Culpa\u201d \u2013 all of which spent plenty of time bashing Trump and cheering on his prosecution. On social media, Cohen continued to attack Trump in the weeks leading up to the trial, and even after it began. The social media jabs reached the point that Judge Juan Merchan told prosecutors Friday to give Cohen a message \u201cfrom the bench\u201d that he should stop speaking about the case. (Merchan has said he cannot legally gag a witness.) Trump has often punched right back in interviews and on social media, including in several instances that violated the judge\u2019s gag order on the former president barring discussion of witnesses in the case. \u2018No one wanted to talk to Cohen\u2019 Beginning with the first witness in the case, Pecker, jurors have heard criticisms from witness after witness of Cohen ahead of his own expected testimony. Pecker, who met with Cohen and Trump at a key Trump Tower meeting in 2015, was asked by Trump attorney Emil Bove whether Cohen was \u201cprone to exaggeration.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Pecker said. Bove then asked Pecker whether he could not trust everything Cohen said. The judge sustained an objection to the question, telling Trump\u2019s attorney in a sidebar discussion that it was not the right place to \u201cimpeach\u201d Cohen\u2019s credibility. More witnesses would keep doing so anyway. Cohen\u2019s\u00a0former\u00a0banker, Gary Farro, then testified that he was specifically given Cohen\u2019s account because he could be firm with individuals who \u201cmay be a little challenging.\u201d Farro said it was fair to call Cohen an \u201caggressive guy.\u201d \u201cAnything he did need, he called me, and it was always something that was urgent,\u201d the banker said. Arguably the most negative assessment of Cohen came from Davidson, who negotiated\u00a0the\u00a0hush money deal with Cohen on Daniels\u2019 behalf in 2016. Davidson described a 2011 conversation\u00a0about a\u00a0blog post on Daniels and Trump on\u00a0thedirty.com, where Cohen unleashed a \u201cbarrage of insults and insinuations and allegations.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think he was accusing us of anything. He was just screaming,\u201d Davidson said. Daniels\u2019\u00a0former\u00a0attorney went on to explain how he ended up involved in the hush money deal, when Daniels\u2019 manager asked him to help finalize the deal for a nondisclosure agreement. Asked why he got involved, Davidson said: \u201cThe moral of the story was: No one wanted to talk to Cohen.\u201d Davidson recalled under questioning from Steinglass that after Trump was elected in 2016, he got a call in December from a \u201cvery despondent and saddened\u201d Cohen. \u201cHe said something to the effect of: \u2018Jesus Christ. Can you f**ing believe I\u2019m not going to Washington? After everything I\u2019ve done for that f**ing guy. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m not going to Washington. I\u2019ve saved that guy\u2019s a** so many times, you don\u2019t even know.\u2019\u201d Others who didn\u2019t interact with Cohen as much as Davidson didn\u2019t have much better things to say. Jeff McConney, the former Trump\u00a0Organization\u00a0controller, was asked what Cohen\u2019s position was at the company. \u201cHe said he was a lawyer,\u201d McConney responded. \u201cDid he work in the legal department?\u201d asked prosecutor Matthew Colangelo. \u201cI guess so,\u201d McConney said derisively. And Hicks, who worked at\u00a0the Trump Organization before becoming a key aide on the 2016 campaign, described to jurors how Cohen \u2013 Trump\u2019s fixer \u2013 was prone to inflate his influence on the campaign. \u201cThere were times where Mr. Cohen did things that you\u00a0felt were not helpful to what you were trying to accomplish,\u00a0right?\u201d Bove asked Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign press secretary. \u201cYes,\u201d Hicks responded. \u201cI used to say that he liked to call himself \u2018a fixer\u2019 or \u2018Mr. Fix It,\u2019 and it was only because he first broke it that he was able to come and fix it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/politics/michael-cohen-trump-hush-money/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}

The high court is considering an emergency appeal over a map drawn by state lawmakers that includes a second majority-Black district in Louisiana\u2019s six-district congressional plan. A conservative-leaning lower court recently ruled against that map, finding that its creation violated the Constitution\u2019s equal protection clause. The second majority-Black district was drawn in response to another court ruling that found an earlier map, which had only one majority-Black district, likely ran afoul of the Voting Rights Act. A federal judge had concluded that the earlier map discriminated against Louisiana\u2019s Black voters, who make up nearly a third of the state\u2019s population but accounted for a majority of voters in just one of the state\u2019s six congressional districts. The new map \u201cis morally repugnant,\u201d the group of mostly White voters told the Supreme Court in the latest filing. \u201cIt\u2019s not a close call.\u201d Because the case raises fundamental questions about how mapmakers consider race when they redraw congressional boundaries every decade, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision could have national implications. It could also affect control of the US House, where Republicans hold a narrow majority.

{"id": "2024_05_10_politics_trump-campaign-rfk-jr", "text": "As Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sustains his support in public polls and makes steady progress on gaining ballot access in states across the country, his independent presidential bid is confounding the campaign of former President Donald Trump and its Republican allies. In recent weeks, Kennedy has gone from a perceived nuisance to a political problem that the Trump campaign is eager to swiftly extinguish, according to conversations with multiple people close to the former president. Trump himself has noticeably escalated his attacks on Kennedy in recent weeks, including posting a lengthy video\u00a0to social media on Thursday that labeled him as a \u201cDemocrat plant\u201d who will pull votes away from his campaign to help President Joe Biden, and urged Republicans not to cast a \u201cwasted protest vote.\u201d The shift comes as recent polls\u00a0show that Kennedy could cut into Trump\u2019s support just as much as he could draw votes away from Biden, with the results serving as an apparent warning for Republicans who have dismissed the independent candidate thus far, the sources say. The consensus held by Trump\u2019s top advisers and allies had long been that Biden has more to lose from the presence of independents, and Kennedy\u00a0specifically, in November. But the former president\u2019s team has taken notice of Kennedy\u2019s standing in some state polls and uptick in media attention, including regular appearances on conservative networks like Newsmax and Fox News, during which he\u2019s openly courted anti-establishment voters. That\u2019s sparked a more concerted effort from Republicans to try and prevent Kennedy from eating into any pro-Trump support. Trump\u2019s advisers and those close to the former president told CNN they still view Kennedy as likely hurting Biden more. However, they privately acknowledge that his impact on Trump\u2019s candidacy varies on a state-by-state basis. They also dismiss the notion that he could be perceived as a serious threat to the former president, but they argue their increased attacks against Kennedy are more an effort to halt any consideration from current or potential Trump supporters from casting their vote for the independent candidate. \u201cRFK is a problem, not a threat,\u201d one senior Trump adviser told CNN, who singled out Pennsylvania as one critical battleground state where Kennedy could hurt Trump, arguing voters in the Keystone State may be drawn more to a candidate who is neither Trump nor Biden. As CNN previously reported, there are some in\u00a0Trump\u2019s orbit who are concerned about Kennedy qualifying for the presidential debates and believe that having earlier debates would make it easier to keep Kennedy off the stage before he could gather further momentum in the polls. \u201cIt\u2019s not that he\u2019s a threat. A lot of it depends on the state, and it\u2019s still not clear who he\u2019s taking more from,\u201d a person close to Trump said. \u201cIf we can make people on the right, who might be open minded to him, hate him very easily because he\u2019s so liberal. Why not weigh him down as much as possible with conservative or conservative leaning voters?\u201d CNN has reached out to Kennedy\u2019s campaign for comment. Trump\u2019s team created a playbook months ago\u00a0to go on offense against Kennedy and define him as a \u201cliberal parading in conservative\u2019s clothing,\u201d as one senior Trump adviser described him to CNN, pointing to a series of his policies on climate change and abortion to paint him as part of the progressive wing of the Democratic party. But in the months since, the messaging has varied. While Trump\u2019s team and Republican National Committee officials stuck to the script and painted Kennedy as a far-left Democrat who doesn\u2019t embody conservative values, the former president himself often had a different take. At a campaign stop at a Harlem\u00a0bodega\u00a0during\u00a0Trump\u2019s criminal trial last month, the former president ignored questions about whether he would consider Kennedy as a potential running mate, after Kennedy suggested emissaries of\u00a0Trump\u2019s\u00a0had reached out about the prospect \u2014 something Trump\u2019s campaign adamantly denied.\u00a0Trump\u00a0instead offered mild praise of Kennedy. Days later, he called Kennedy \u201ca nice guy\u201d during an interview with Real America\u2019s Voice, adding he wasn\u2019t sure whether Kennedy hurt him or Biden more. \u201cWell, I think he\u2019s a nice guy. I\u2019ve known him. He\u2019s extremely liberal. He\u2019s more liberal than anybody,\u201d Trump told the radio host. \u201cThey say he hurts Biden, I think, I\u2019m not sure that that\u2019s true. But he might hurt Biden a little bit more, you don\u2019t know.\u201d Flash forward to May, and Trump has adopted a more aggressive stance toward his independent rival. He has repeatedly attacked Kennedy on Truth Social, including labeling him\u00a0as \u201ca Radical Left Lunatic\u201d and calling him \u201cthe dumbest member of the Kennedy Clan,\u201d as well as needling Kennedy\u2019s positions on vaccines and environmental policy, among others. Asked about Trump ratcheting up his attacks, a Trump campaign adviser told CNN: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen an uptick in the amount of coverage he\u2019s getting. And you know, we just want to reiterate our message. We want Trump to do what he does, what he does with everyone else. He separates the person from the politician.\u201d CNN\u2019s Aaron Pellish contributed to this story.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/politics/trump-campaign-rfk-jr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_politics_lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims", "text": "The Republican National Committee last week sent out a scripted call to voters\u2019 phones on behalf of new co-chair Lara Trump saying Democrats committed \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election. It\u2019s the latest example of how the RNC under the former president\u2019s daughter-in-law is perpetuating lies about the 2020 election, even as prominent Republicans say the party needs to look forward to win in 2024. \u201cWe all know the problems. No photo IDs, unsecured ballot drop boxes, mass mailing of ballots, and voter rolls chock full of deceased people and non-citizens are just a few examples of the massive fraud that took place,\u201d the RNC call said. \u201cIf Democrats have their way, your vote could be canceled out by someone who isn\u2019t even an American citizen.\u201d The claim of \u201cmassive fraud\u201d in the 2020 election marks a significant shift in messaging for the RNC because lies about the 2020 election had not been a consistent theme in its messaging since Donald Trump left office. But the call\u2019s message is largely consistent with the views publicly espoused over the past four years by Lara Trump, who was elected as co-chair in early March as part of Donald Trump\u2019s takeover of the GOP. Lara Trump has a long history of echoing his election fraud claims, according to a CNN KFile analysis of her past statements as a commentator and surrogate for the former president. \u201cI\u2019m sure you agree with co-chair Trump that we cannot allow the chaos and questions of the 2020 election to ever happen again,\u201d said the call, which was obtained by CNN\u2019s KFile from the anti-robocall application Nomorobo, which estimated 145,000 calls were sent with the message from April 1-7. It comes amid previous CNN reporting about the RNC asking employees who are reapplying for their jobs whether they believe the 2020 election was stolen in an apparent litmus test for hiring. The RNC denied any such litmus test existed.\u00a0Lara Trump and new chair Michael Whatley succeeded Drew McKissick and Ronna McDaniel, who had earned the ire of the former president because of his dissatisfaction with how the RNC handled claims of fraud around the 2020 election, CNN previously reported. There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, as even some state GOP election officials and former Trump Attorney General William Barr have acknowledged. The former president and his supporters filed more than 60 court cases in six key battleground states following the election and lost every one of them. And, they have still not brought forth any evidence of the rampant cheating they continue to talk about on the campaign trail. But in the years since the 2020 election, Lara Trump has continued to push claims of fraud. Her comments have been in line with those of her father-in-law, who\u2019s successfully reshaped the GOP in his image and easily secured his third-straight GOP nomination this year. Polling, for example, shows that a majority of GOP voters think the 2020 election result was illegitimate. A CNN poll released last September found that 71% of Republicans said President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cdid not legitimately win enough votes to win the presidency.\u201d From November 2020 to February 2024, Lara Trump propagated the narrative of Democratic cheating in the 2020 presidential election. And even after she was elected co-chair and said claims of a stolen election are \u201cin the past,\u201d she didn\u2019t repudiate those baseless accusations. \u201cWell, I think we\u2019re past that. I think that\u2019s in the past. We learned a lot. Certainly, we took a lot of notes,\u201d Trump said in an NBC interview when asked whether claims of a stolen 2020 election would be the official position of the RNC in 2024. She went on to tout lawsuits across 23 states \u201cto ensure that it is harder to cheat and easier to vote,\u201d while raising questions about pandemic-era voting procedures during the 2020 election. In the same interview, Trump also added the GOP needed to \u201ctrust mail-in voting.\u201d Neither the RNC nor Lara Trump responded to multiple requests for comment. A long history of spreading election lies As recently as February 2024, Lara Trump said she did not believe Biden received 81 million votes in the 2020 election. \u201cDoes anyone actually believe that in 2020, 81 million people were so inspired by a guy who could only get 10 people (to attended events) \u2026that he had the most massive turnout in the history of elections?\u201d she said at a Trump event in South Carolina just days before she announced her campaign for RNC co-chair. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t believe that.\u201d On her internet show and podcast, and in public events, she often spread outlandish and nonsensical claims about the 2020 election. On an episode of her show that aired on December 30, 2020, Trump agreed with her co-hosts that the election did not pass the \u201csmell test\u201d and falsely suggested that dead voters helped Biden win. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know if this is true, but somebody sent me this. Donald Trump got 74 million votes. There are 133 million registered voters in the United States. If every single registered voter went out and voted, which we know is basically impossible, doesn\u2019t happen, there would only be 59 million votes left for Joe Biden. So how the heck did he get 81 million votes?\u201d she said. The comments cite a widely debunked analysis that misrepresents the number of people eligible to vote. \u201cYou\u2019re discriminating against all the dead people, Lara. How dare you!\u201d said one co-host. \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s true,\u201d she responded. A CNN analysis previously found no evidence to support this claim, debunking the misinformation spread by Trump supporters online in the aftermath of the 2020 results. The 2020 election saw a record-breaking turnout, with 155 million people casting their votes, as reported by the US Census Bureau. This marked the highest voter participation of the 21st century, with 66.8% of eligible citizens aged 18 and older voting. Later in the episode, Trump said, \u201cI think that [Democrats] know that the Republicans are not gonna let it stand. They\u2019re not gonna certify votes for Joe Biden. And it is likely that they will be voting for Donald Trump for a second term.\u201d In an episode of her podcast weeks earlier, she claimed the odds of Biden winning in swing states were \u201cone in one quadrillion to the fourth power,\u201d as mail-in ballots were counted, failing to cite a statistical analysis. Though Biden narrowly lost with in-person voters, 46% of voters voted by mail in 2020. As votes were counted, Biden pulled ahead, according to an analysis from Pew Research. Though nothing was abnormal or illegal about the process, Lara Trump has also referred to the counting of votes nefariously. \u201cWe gotta make up so much for all the cheating,\u201d Trump said on her podcast in September 2023. \u201cWe know the Democrats love to do that. We need to go into this thing with such a big lead that they\u2019re like, \u2018oh my God, we can\u2019t do a 3:00 a.m. spike with this. We\u2019re never gonna make it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/politics/lara-trump-rnc-2020-election-fraud-claims/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_11_politics_presidents-campaigning-what-matters", "text": "When he talks to reporters outside the New York courtroom where he is on trial for falsifying business records, former President Donald Trump usually complains he\u2019d rather be with voters. \u201cThey want to keep me off the campaign trail,\u201d he said on Tuesday, suggesting the trial is part of an election interference conspiracy, for which there is no evidence. It was a similar story last week, when Trump said he should be campaigning in battleground states. \u201cWe\u2019re at a courthouse instead of being in any one of I would say 10 states where I\u2019d like to be right now,\u201d he said to TV cameras that beamed his remarks around the country. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden has been folding trips to Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida into his schedule. Trump chose not to campaign when court was out of session Wednesday, but he will appear in New Jersey this weekend. Both major candidates obviously perceive value in the act of campaigning \u2014 being on the trail and speaking directly to voters. It\u2019s hard to believe that early American presidents did no personal campaigning whatsoever. They thought it was beneath them and the office they held. I talked to Brendan\u00a0Doherty, a\u00a0professor of political science at the United States Naval Academy and author of the books,\u00a0\u201cThe Rise of the President\u2019s Permanent Campaign\u201d\u00a0and\u00a0\u201cFundraiser in Chief: Presidents and the Politics of Campaign Cash,\u201d about why early presidents stayed off the trail and how this became the permanent campaign. Our conversation, conducted by email, is below: WOLF: Why didn\u2019t early presidents personally campaign? DOHERTY: In the early decades of the republic, presidential candidates adhered to the norm that they should not actively campaign for office. It was seen as unseemly to seek the office to which they hoped to be elected. But that didn\u2019t stop them from finding other ways of communicating with voters. WOLF: How did these early non-campaigning presidents get their message out? DOHERTY: While early presidential candidates didn\u2019t actively campaign, their supporters got the word out on their behalf. Newspapers were openly\u00a0partisan in the early republic, and many of their articles openly praised or criticized various candidates. While candidates did not attend political conventions in the 1800s, supporters made the case for their preferred candidates in ways that drove news coverage. In the late 1800s, some presidential candidates mounted what were called \u201cfront porch campaigns.\u201d They would speak to supporters at or near their homes, and newspapers would cover these speeches and spread their messages across the country. WOLF: What are some key moments in the rise of the current model of campaigning? DOHERTY: In 1866, President Andrew Johnson broke from precedent and actively campaigned in the midterm elections. His travel to give a series of speeches was called the Swing around the Circle, and he was criticized both for actively campaigning and for using inflammatory rhetoric while doing so. Two years later, the House of Representatives impeached Johnson for, among other things, giving these campaign speeches that brought Congress into \u201cdisgrace, ridicule, hatred, contempt, and reproach.\u201d In 1896, Democratic nominee William Jennings Bryan actively campaigned across the country, while the eventual winner, Republican William McKinley, conducted a front porch campaign. In 1932, Franklin Roosevelt became the first presidential candidate to appear at a convention to accept his nomination in person. And in 1948, Harry Truman actively campaigned across the country, giving speeches from the back of a train in what became known as his whistle-stop campaign. WOLF: Who was, in your view, the best natural campaigner who ran for president? What did they do differently? DOHERTY: While it\u2019s hard to pick out a single best campaigner, two who come to mind are John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. Kennedy actively campaigned in the primary elections in 1960 at a time when leading candidates often skipped active campaigning during the nomination contest. But he wanted to demonstrate his electability to party leaders who might be skeptical that a Catholic could win the White House after the only other Catholic major party nominee had lost in a landslide to Herbert Hoover in 1928. Kennedy was widely seen as charming and eloquent on the stump, and his wins in the Wisconsin and West Virginia primaries helped him win his party\u2019s nomination and then the White House. Reagan channeled his years of performance as an actor and his sense of humor to campaign effectively for the presidency. His voice, his timing, and his telling of stories and jokes to connect with his audiences won him much praise. When questioners implied that being an actor wasn\u2019t adequate preparation to be president, Reagan would respond that he didn\u2019t know how someone could be an effective president who hadn\u2019t been an actor. WOLF: Is active campaigning \u2014 holding rallies and flying from stop to stop \u2014 effective in a country of more than 335 million people? A candidate can only shake so many hands. Plus, most people already lean toward one party or the other. What does putting a candidate on the trail accomplish? DOHERTY: While presidential candidates can only meet a relatively small sliver of the American population \u2014 and, more importantly, of the population of the small number of Electoral College\u00a0battleground states\u00a0that will decide a presidential election \u2014 their campaigning can drive news coverage, which has a multiplier effect when it comes to getting their message out. Political science studies have shown that local news coverage is often more favorable to presidents and presidential candidates than national news coverage is, so candidates campaign in part so that local media outlets will amplify their campaign messages. While it\u2019s increasingly difficult for candidates to grab and hold the public\u2019s attention given our increasingly fragmented media landscape, that certainly doesn\u2019t stop presidential hopefuls from trying. WOLF: I suppose the inverse of candidates who don\u2019t campaign is our current system, in which they only briefly stop campaigning to govern. Why is the permanent campaign a problem, and how could it be fixed? DOHERTY: Modern presidents campaign for themselves and for their fellow party members throughout their term in office. They raise campaign funds and they travel to key electoral states. While presidents used to try not to appear to be overly focused on campaigning too early in their term in office, that\u2019s no longer the case. In the summer of his third year in office, Ronald Reagan refused to tell an interviewer whether or not he would run for another term because he said that he didn\u2019t want everything he did as president to be seen through a political lens. In contrast, Donald Trump filed paperwork establishing his reelection campaign committee on the day in 2017 when he was inaugurated as president, and he held his first reelection fundraiser less than six months later, in June of his first year in office. When presidents begin their explicit campaigning earlier and earlier in their term in office, they are responding to the incentives of our electoral system. But time is the president\u2019s scarcest resource, and time spent campaigning is time not spent doing the important job to which he, and someday she, was elected. For better or worse, there are no readily apparent realistic fixes that could stop a reelection-focused president from campaigning for reelection throughout his term in office. WOLF: If transportation and technology have helped candidates directly reach more and more people, where do you see campaign methods heading next? DOHERTY: Technological advances have helped candidates connect with the American people, from the radio to television, the internet, and now social media. These developments, along with advances in campaigns\u2019 ability to micro-target voters in key states with messages designed to appeal to issues they care about, have led campaigns to shift away from broadcasting appeals in favor of narrow, targeted outreach to potentially persuadable voters. In an era in which so much of what voters do online is tracked and can be used to build profiles of voters\u2019 interests and preferences, I expect that this micro-targeting will become ever more precise, allowing campaigns to tailor increasingly specific messages to the voters they are trying to reach.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/politics/presidents-campaigning-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_12_politics_deanne-criswell-fema", "text": "Standing in front of a ruined warehouse in tornado-ravaged Marietta, Oklahoma, FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell was full of questions. \u201cHave you gotten any sleep yet?\u201d she asked the mayor. To the sheriff: \u201cYour home is okay? Your family?\u201d  \u201cDo you have any questions for me?\u201d she prompted another official. It\u2019s a style emblematic of Criswell\u2019s attitude toward disaster relief: On the ground in this small rural community following a devastating EF-4 tornado, her first priority is the people. After a wave of deadly tornados struck Oklahoma, CNN joined Criswell for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at how she and her agency approach natural disasters.  Her message to officials is straightforward: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this alone.\u201d The reaction from local leaders and survivors alike is uniformly one of gratitude that the country\u2019s top emergency response official came to their town to see the damage and hear their stories firsthand. But Criswell shrugged off the praise and thanks. \u201cThis is what I do,\u201d she said. Breaking barriers Long before she became the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Criswell got her start as a firefighter in Aurora, Colorado \u2014 just the sixth woman to hold that job. \u201cI never thought I was going to be a firefighter,\u201d she told CNN in an interview. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t on my list of things to do.\u201d At the time, Criswell was going through a divorce and \u2014 juggling college tuition with being a single mother to two sons \u2014 decided to join the Colorado Air National Guard to help make ends meet. Given a choice between loading bombs or fighting fires, she chose the latter. \u201cThe firefighters were having a lot of fun and I said, \u2018I\u2019ll give that a shot,\u2019\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cI loved it, I was good at it, and I said, \u2018I\u2019m going to come back and this is the job that I\u2019m going to do.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s a job Criswell would do for more than two decades, including two overseas deployments to Kuwait and Qatar after 9/11. Along the way, she graduated from college, earned two master\u2019s degrees, and eventually rose to lead Aurora\u2019s office of emergency management, where she worked to house evacuees and reunify families displaced by Hurricane Katrina. She joined FEMA during the Obama administration, helping to oversee the agency\u2019s response to natural disasters across the country. In 2019, she became the first woman to lead New York City\u2019s Emergency Management Department, where \u2014 less than a year into the job \u2014 she helped navigate the city through the darkest days of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, as FEMA\u2019s top official, Criswell hopes her unorthodox career path will encourage others to seize opportunities and take professional risks. \u201cYou have to be able to allow the journey to help guide you along the way,\u201d she said. \u201cHave the confidence in yourself, take the personal risk if necessary, and just do the work to get to the level that you want to get to.\u201d A seat at the table When Criswell was unanimously confirmed as FEMA\u2019s 12th administrator \u2014 becoming the first woman to hold that position \u2014 shattering a glass ceiling wasn\u2019t at front of mind. \u201cWhen I first was asked to come in and do this job, I didn\u2019t really think about it,\u201d she admittted.  That changed in her first week on the job. \u201cOne of my younger female employees had come up to me after a meeting and she said, \u2018You know, a year ago, there were zero women in my chain of command between me and the president of the United States,\u2019\u201d Criswell said. \u201c\u2019Now there are five.\u2019 And so what it told me is, people notice, right?\u201d  Criswell knows from experience the obstacles women can face in her line of work. \u201cAs I was coming up in my career, it was always a balance between demonstrating your confidence and your competence with being called the \u2018B word,\u2019\u201d she said, acknowledging that term was directed at her \u201cmany times\u201d over her career. \u201cYou have to believe in yourself that you deserve a seat at that table, that you deserve your voice to be heard,\u201d she said. Now that she\u2019s a woman in a major leadership role in the federal government, Criswell uses her position to help elevate the voices of the women beneath her. \u201cI like to watch how women are either voicing their opinions, or I can maybe sense if they\u2019re afraid to voice their opinions and help encourage them,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cAnd when somebody says something, I will immediately step in and say, \u2018well, that\u2019s a really amazing idea,\u2019 right? In giving that validation at the time, I think it\u2019s important, especially as the leader in the room, to always be observant about the dynamics of what\u2019s happening within that conversation.\u201d That dynamic is already starting to change \u2014 Criswell\u2019s first meeting in Oklahoma, with state emergency management leaders and regional FEMA officials, was led entirely by women. On-the-ground leadership In three years as administrator, Criswell has logged more than 100,000 miles of travel, visiting disaster zones in every corner of the United States. Criswell said seeing the devastation firsthand is critically important to the decisions she makes when determining FEMA\u2019s response. \u201cIt helps me get rid of the red tape,\u201d she said. \u201cIt helps me break down bureaucracy in order to ensure that it\u2019s more than numbers \u2014 it\u2019s people.\u201d Criswell emphasizes the importance of taking the time to hear directly from victims. Otherwise, she said, \u201cyou can\u2019t feel that emotion, you can\u2019t feel the heartache.\u201d It also allows her to get face time with officials at every level. In Oklahoma, Criswell made a point of meeting with first responders, local leaders, state emergency management officials, and representatives from affected tribal nations. Criswell knows that disaster relief transcends party, an approach that has earned her respect and appreciation from across the political spectrum. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a disaster and there\u2019s people in need, we\u2019re all Americans,\u201d Oklahoma\u2019s Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt told CNN shortly after appearing with Criswell at a news conference. \u201cAnd that\u2019s, I think, the administrator\u2019s attitude. These are federal agencies that we have to work with regardless of who\u2019s in the White House.\u201d  Criswell agrees. \u201cThis kind of a partnership, this is absolutely critical to make sure we bring the right people into these communities to help with their specific needs,\u201d she said. Shaking the governor\u2019s hand, she added, \u201cWe will be in touch \u2013 you have my number.\u201d Putting people first At FEMA headquarters in Washington, DC, the agency\u2019s motto is prominently displayed on the wall: \u201cHelping people before, during, and after disasters.\u201d It\u2019s a mission statement Criswell has taken to heart. Coming into the job, she said, \u201cI wanted to make sure that we put people first.\u201d As a former city emergency management director, Criswell knew all-too-well FEMA\u2019s reputation for bureaucratic red tape and convoluted relief programs that made it harder to get help to people who needed it. \u201cWe are an agency that deals with risk every day \u2013 that\u2019s the nature of what we do, yet when it comes to our policies, we can sometimes be a little bit more risk averse,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to get away from that. I wanted us to really understand what it meant to put people first.\u201d  Her solution was to listen. \u201cI went to different open disasters and listened to our people, listened to governors, listened to actual people that were impacted about what their barriers were,\u201d Criswell said. \u201cAnd then we were able to address those by making changes.\u201d The result was the most sweeping reforms to the FEMA\u2019s disaster assistance programs in two decades. The changes, which went into effect in March, include: Criswell believes the changes will be transformational and make it easier for FEMA to have an immediate impact on the ground. \u201cWe can actually help people on their road to recovery in a way that makes sense,\u201d she said, \u201cinstead of being so restricted by some of the regulations that we have.\u201d That focus on helping people extends to her staff as well. Recognizing the toll that responding to a seemingly endless stream of natural disasters can have on her team\u2019s mental health, Criswell implemented a \u201cwellness room\u201d just outside FEMA HQ\u2019s nerve center \u2014 complete with comfortable chairs and a soothing livestream of birds at a feeder. \u201cThis is a spot where they can come take a timeout,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to be able to invest in our employees and we have to be able to give them, not just the support, but the permission to recognize when they need a break.\u201d \u2018Grandma Cookie\u2019 To her staff, she\u2019s \u201cAdministrator Criswell.\u201d But to her family, she\u2019s known by a different title.  \u201cI\u2019m affectionately known as \u2018Grandma Cookie,\u2019\u201d she admitted Despite a career filled with demanding jobs, Criswell has never lost sight of her other job: that of a mom to two grown sons and grandmother of three. It hasn\u2019t come without sacrifices, between multiple deployments and constant travel to different disaster zones. But when Criswell appeared before Congress for her confirmation hearing, her sons were by her side. \u201cWhen they were with me that day and you could see how proud they were and how successful they have both become,\u201d she said, \u201cit really just gave me a really warm feeling as a mother.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/politics/deanne-criswell-fema/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_politics_clarence-thomas-pushes-back-critics", "text": "Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas repeatedly pushed back on his critics during remarks Friday at a judicial conference in Alabama, lamenting what he described as the \u201cnastiness\u201d and \u201clies\u201d directed at him and calling\u00a0Washington a \u201chideous place.\u201d Asked whether his jurisprudence required a degree of courage, Thomas said he didn\u2019t view himself as courageous \u2013 particularly when compared with servicemembers, and firefighters and people who defuse bombs. Thomas said he was simply doing his job. \u201cBeing in Washington, you have to get used to particularly people who are reckless,\u201d Thomas, a conservative and the court\u2019s most senior associate justice, said. \u201cThey don\u2019t bomb you, necessarily, but they bomb your reputation or your good name or your honor. And that\u2019s not a\u00a0crime but they can do as much harm that way.\u201d Speaking at the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals conference in Point Clear, Alabama, Thomas argued\u00a0that it would be a disservice to those soldiers and first responders \u201cnot to sit at my desk and make decisions with a lifetime appointment that we know are the right decisions.\u201d Thomas, while not speaking directly to a series of reports\u00a0about ethics that have\u00a0plagued him for months, repeatedly returned to his critics without prompting from US District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle, who moderated the discussion. \u201cMy wife and I, the last two or three years, it\u2019s been \u2013 just the nastiness and the lies \u2013\u00a0it\u2019s just incredible,\u201d Thomas said. Thomas and his wife, Ginni, have been the target of a good deal of criticism in recent years. Several of Thomas\u2019 critics, including Democratic members of Congress, have called on him to recuse himself from Supreme Court cases involving the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol because of his wife\u2019s efforts to reverse the 2020 presidential election in former President Donald Trump\u2019s favor. Ginni Thomas has\u00a0acknowledged attending Trump\u2019s rally before the Capitol attack. Justice Thomas has declined to recuse himself\u00a0from cases this year involving\u00a0the January 6 attack, including a blockbuster appeal regarding Trump\u2019s claims of absolute immunity from criminal charges for his efforts\u00a0to overturn the election results. Thomas has also faced criticism for accepting private jet travel and posh vacations from Republican megadonor Harlan Crow, first reported by ProPublica. In response to the blowback, Thomas updated his financial disclosure forms,\u00a0and the Supreme Court adopted a code of conduct for the first time last year. At one point on Friday, Thomas told a story about a walk he took with a friend before breaking off into an aside. \u201cThat\u2019s before they started attacking my friends,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI hope I still have some.\u201d As he has in the past, Thomas also spared little criticism for Washington, DC. \u201cI think what you\u2019re gonna find, and especially in Washington, [is] people pride themselves in being awful,\u201d Thomas said one point. The remark elicited laughter in the room, until Thomas continued. \u201cIt is a hideous place, as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d Thomas said, noting that he liked to visit other places where people \u201cdon\u2019t pride themselves in doing harmful things merely because they have the capacity to do it.\u201d Thomas, 75, also appeared to lament a loss of trust within the Supreme Court, telling the conference that the stunning leak of a draft abortion opinion in 2022 wouldn\u2019t have happened when he joined the court in 1991. It wasn\u2019t the first time Thomas has made those points \u2013 he once likened the leak to an \u201cinfidelity\u201d \u2013 but his remarks Friday suggested the fallout from the leak of the decision overturning Roe v. Wade may still be top of mind. \u201cWe may have been a dysfunctional family, but we were a family,\u201d Thomas said of the court when he first joined in 1991. \u201cIt would be inconceivable that anyone would leak an opinion of the court or do anything to intentionally harm one another.\u201d Thomas also became the latest justice in recent weeks to raise concern with the Supreme Court\u2019s applications docket, the process the court uses to handle emergency requests. That docket has come under fierce criticism in recent years, in part because the court often decides the requests on a short timeline, usually without oral argument and often with orders that do not indicate how the justices voted. \u201cI think there\u2019s some concern about that among my colleagues \u2013 certainly with me \u2013 because it short circuits our process,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cThe way that we\u2019re doing it now, I think, is not a thorough way of dealing with very, very difficult issues.\u201d As he returned to his critics, Thomas suggested the lesson he had taken away from the last year of controversy was that he would not react with \u201cnastiness for nastiness.\u201d \u201cYou have some choices. You don\u2019t get to prevent people from doing horrible things or saying horrible things,\u201d Thomas said. But, he said, he had come to accept \u201cthe fact that they can\u2019t change you unless you permit that.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/politics/clarence-thomas-pushes-back-critics/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_politics_us-military-aid-ukraine", "text": "The US announced on Friday a new $400 million military aid package to Ukraine. The package includes weapons Ukraine has been asking for, including Patriot missile system munitions, High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMAR) systems and ammunition, Stinger anti-air missiles, 155mm artillery rounds, Bradley Fighting Vehicles, and Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles (MRAPs), among other equipment. \u201cAs President Biden has made clear, the United States and the international coalition we have assembled will continue to stand with Ukraine in its defense of its freedom,\u201d Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement. The announcement marks the second Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) package since President Joe Biden signed a long-delayed national security supplemental securing $60 billion in funding for Ukraine. Last month, just moments after Biden signed the legislation, the US announced a $1 billion PDA package to Ukraine. Biden\u00a0said at the time\u00a0that shipments of the equipment to Ukraine would begin \u201cin the next few hours.\u201d And just two days later, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced a\u00a0historic $6 billion\u00a0long-term investment package to purchase new equipment for Ukraine. The $6 billion package \u2014\u00a0the largest the US has announced \u2014\u00a0is under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI). USAI is different from than the PDA package in that it contracts with the US defense industry to purchase new equipment, whereas PDAs pull equipment from existing US stocks. While some equipment under the PDA can arrive within days of the announcement, support under USAI takes longer; Austin said at the time that the Pentagon was \u201cgoing to move as fast as we can to get them the capability as fast as industry can produce.\u201d On Friday, the State Department also announced the $30 million sale of HIMARS to Ukraine, a rocket launcher that Kyiv\u2019s military has used to great effect against Russian forces. The emergency sale, which includes three of the HIMARS vehicles, will be paid for by Germany on behalf of Ukraine. But\u00a0officials have told CNN\u00a0that Russia is seeking to exploit that lag time and step up its attacks on Ukraine as the embattled country waits for assistance to arrive. The lag in those shipments is made more severe given the months-long delay in aid as Congress debated the supplemental legislation. On Wednesday evening, Ukrainian authorities said Russia launched dozens of missiles and drones on Ukraine, targeting energy infrastructure. On Friday, a Ukrainian military source told CNN that Russian forces had penetrated at least one kilometer inside northern Ukraine in an assault on a border town on Thursday evening. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Friday that Russia \u201claunched a new wave of counteroffensive actions in ([northern Kharkiv region). Ukraine met them there with our troops, brigades and artillery.\u201d \u201cBut our military and military command were aware of this and anticipated their forces to meet the enemy with fire,\u201d he said. \u201cNow there is a fierce battle in this area. \u2026 I think as of now we have stopped the enemy with artillery fire.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reporting.

{"id": "2024_05_11_politics_trump-schedule-court-campaign", "text": "Former President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that his criminal trial in Manhattan has prevented him from campaigning in key swing states. \u201cI should be right now in Pennsylvania, in Florida, in many other states, North Carolina, Georgia - campaigning,\u201d Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, told reporters outside the courtroom on the second day of the trial in April. He made\u00a0similar\u00a0comments in the courthouse hallway on subsequent days,\u00a0saying\u00a0that, if not for the trial he baselessly blamed on President Joe Biden, he was \u201csupposed to be\u201d in Ohio, New Hampshire and South Carolina. It\u2019s certainly possible that Trump would have been campaigning in all of those states if there was no trial. But a review of his activities over the trial\u2019s first four weeks shows that he has done little campaign travel, and held few public campaign events, on days off from court. Instead, he has spent most of his 12 court-free days out of voters\u2019 view at his properties in New York, New Jersey and Florida. And he did not use any of those 12 court-free days to visit Pennsylvania, Georgia, South Carolina, Ohio or New Hampshire, states he asserted the trial was preventing him from visiting. (He is\u00a0scheduled\u00a0to visit Ohio for a fundraiser\u00a0on May 15.) No public events on most free days Trump\u2019s trial is not in session on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays, and the judge also scheduled one Monday off in late April.\u00a0As of this Saturday, May 11,\u00a0that left Trump with 12 court-free days to do as he pleased, compared to 15 days where he was required in court, in the\u00a027 days\u00a0beginning with the\u00a0opening of jury selection on April 15. Trump held no public events on\u00a0seven of the 12 court-free days. And it was no public events on eight of the 12 days\u00a0if you don\u2019t count his one-minute-long appearance for the cameras prior to a private meeting with the president of Poland at Trump Tower in New York City. Trump has visited few swing states since the trial began Trump has done some campaign travel during the trial. He held campaign rallies in the swing states of\u00a0Wisconsin and Michigan on one court-free Wednesday in May, and he booked a weekend April rally in the swing state of North Carolina that was\u00a0called off at the last minute because of severe weather.(He attended a closed-door\u00a0fundraiser\u00a0in the state earlier in the day.) He\u00a0is scheduled to hold\u00a0a rally on Saturday afternoon\u00a0in New Jersey, which has for three decades been a Democratic stronghold in presidential elections, and he\u00a0appeared in May at a Formula One race in Miami. Trump also made campaign-style appearances in Democratic-dominated New York City before or after\u00a0three\u00a0court\u00a0appearances. And he has turned the hallway outside the Manhattan courtroom into a de facto campaigning venue, regularly speaking to media cameras before and after sitting in court. But he has let the majority of the 12 off days pass\u00a0without doing any public campaign events. Instead, he has spent some of the time\u00a0golfing at his Bedminster club in New Jersey,\u00a0attending\u00a0a Republican National Committee fundraiser at his Mar-a-Lago club and residence in Florida, attending a Mar-a-Lago\u00a0dinner\u00a0for people who bought large numbers of his \u201cNFT\u201d digital trading cards, and\u00a0making phone calls and holding meetings. His complete itinerary on the off days is not known. Here is a list showing how he is known to have spent his time from the opening day of the trial, April 15,\u00a0until May 11. April 15: Court April 16: Court (made appearance at New York City bodega afterward) April 17: Day off court. No public events, but met with Polish President Andrzej Duda at Trump Tower and appeared on camera for less than a minute April 18: Court April 19: Court April 20: Day off court.

{"id": "2024_05_12_politics_kari-lake-arizona-senate-abortion", "text": "Less than 24 hours after Arizona\u2019s near-total abortion ban was repealed, Kari Lake challenged Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, her likely opponent for the state\u2019s US Senate seat, to a debate on the issue \u2013 ideally over Mother\u2019s Day weekend. \u201cWe owe it to the people of this state not just to state our policies, but to defend our policies,\u201d the GOP candidate said to reporters gathered outsider her campaign office. \u201cAnd I\u2019m willing to do that.\u201d Within minutes of Lake\u2019s invite, Gallego\u2019s campaign declined. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to debate. Kari Lake\u2019s record is clear,\u201d spokesperson Hannah Goss said in a statement. For Arizona Republicans, the resurgence of the state\u2019s Civil War-era abortion ban was a political catastrophe that threatened to tip competitive races toward Democrats. Its repeal, Republicans argue, will return the focus to more favorable issues for the party such as immigration, even as Democrats vow to keep up talking about reproductive rights. The situation has been even more dire for Lake, who lost her 2022 gubernatorial bid\u00a0by 17,000 votes\u00a0to a candidate who campaigned on repealing the ban\u00a0Lake\u00a0once praised\u00a0and\u00a0is now seeking a US Senate seat that could determine which party controls the chamber. For weeks,\u00a0Lake has faced non-stop questions over inconsistencies between how she\u2019s talked about the law over the last two years, further complicating her efforts to unify the party and move on from her last campaign. Lake, like Trump, has said policy should be decided at the state level and personally lobbied members of the Arizona Legislature to address the ban, which prohibits the procedure at all stages of pregnancy except to save the life of the mother. She\u2019s said she opposes federal abortion bans as well as federal funding for abortions and vowed to pursue pro-family policies to help people choose to be parents. But she has also, during her last campaign, said she was \u201cthrilled\u201d by the ban, which she called a \u201cgreat law,\u201d and said abortion pills should be illegal. In the last month alone, she called the ban \u201cout of step with Arizonans\u201d but also lamented that \u201cunfortunately\u201d it wasn\u2019t being enforced. At an event this month, she called the repeal the \u201cmessy and complicated\u201d part of the issue being returned to the states. \u201cShe regrettably, has been on record on all sides of this issue,\u201d said Stan Barnes, an Arizona Republican strategist who has known Lake for 20 years. \u201cAnd the one thing you cannot do in the pro-life, pro-choice argument as a political figure, is to be on more than one side.\u201d Defining values The 1864 ban has been at the center of Arizona politics, and Lake\u2019s political campaigns, for the last two election cycles. Democrats have been pushing to repeal the ban, which prohibits the procedure at all stages of pregnancy except to save the life of the pregnant person and imposes two to five year prison sentences on abortion providers, since 2019, as the conservative majority on the US Supreme Court grew. In March 2022, in the midst of the midterm election and months before the US Supreme Court\u2019s June Dobbs decision ended federal protections for abortion, Arizona Republican Gov. Doug Ducey signed a 15-week abortion limit into law. That law includes no exceptions for rape or incest. As Lake praised the ban,\u00a0her Democratic opponent,\u00a0Katie\u00a0Hobbs,\u00a0campaigned on repealing the law\u00a0with the backing of abortion rights groups\u00a0and went on to win the election. \u201cWe know how to beat Kari Lake,\u201d said Mini Timmaraju, the president of Reproductive Freedom for All, which backed Hobbs and has now endorsed Gallego. The Dobbs decision allowed the territorial ban to kick in, setting off a years-long legal battle that culminated in the Arizona Supreme Court\u2019s April 9 decision to revive the ban, setting off weeks of tense votes in the legislature to repeal it. The repeal won\u2019t go into effect until 90 days after the legislature adjourns\u00a0later this year, which means the ban\u00a0could still\u00a0go into effect as soon as June 27\u00a0for a few weeks or\u00a0months. Democrats in Arizona, from President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign down to the legislature, have argued that the state\u2019s 15-week limit is still a draconian restriction that is only possible because of Trump and Republicans in the Senate. Asked for comment on criticisms from Democrats, who have described her past support for the ban as extreme, the Lake campaign referred to her website, which features a five-and-a-half minute video Lake released after the state Supreme Court ruling. For Lake, the abortion news cycle has distracted from her efforts to rebrand from her 2022 campaign, when she campaigned on baseless claims that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump due to widespread fraud. Though Lake hasn\u2019t stopped litigating her own 2022 loss to Hobbs, she has campaigned more aggressively on policy issues like housing affordability, the economy and the border. She has\u00a0spent months reaching out to prominent Republicans \u2013 from former Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl to her 2022 GOP primary rival Karrin Taylor Robson \u2013 to unify the party around her. She has also won the endorsement of the National Republican Senatorial Committee ahead of her July 30 primary against Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb. A handful of prominent Senate Republicans have visited Arizona to fundraise and campaign with her. At a recent press conference with South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the questioning turned almost immediately to abortion. Lake stressed the pro-family approach she has taken to explaining her current view on abortion. She invited two of her campaign staffers, Alex and Andorra Nicoll, to come up to the podium with their 4-week-old son Fitzgerald swaddled against his mother\u2019s chest. \u201cThe reason why we\u2019re working so hard to get Kari Lake elected to the United States Senate is for babies like Fitz here in Arizona and across the country, because she will get to the United States Senate and work to save our next generation from radicals like Ruben Gallego,\u201d Alex Nicoll told reporters. As the questions on her stance on the 1864 law and the messy process behind its repeal continued, Lake tried to change the subject. \u201cI have a member of leadership in the US Senate here. If you have any questions pertaining to him, what\u2019s happening in Washington DC, or in this race, I\u2019m happy to answer those,\u201d she said. \u201cIf not, we can wrap it up.\u201d Lake has been asked about her stance on the ban even in friendly venues, including a recent town hall hosted by college Republicans at Arizona State University. The event drew a mix conservative college students and older supporters, some in yellow \u201cKari Lake Won\u201d shirts. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen both your opposition and your support for this law in the past,\u201d a student said,\u00a0according to a recording obtained by CNN. \u201cCould you please define your values and tell us how you will remedy the doubts that pro lifers have in you right now?\u201d Lake framed her approach as a pragmatic strategy to \u201csave as many babies as possible\u201d by defeating an abortion rights ballot initiative\u00a0currently gathering signatures\u00a0that would amend the state constitution to protect abortion access up to fetal viability, which doctors estimate is around 22 to 24 weeks of pregnancy. Like Trump, she said, she supports exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. \u201cSomehow when you say that, all of a sudden pro-lifers, they don\u2019t like you anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I know not everybody in the pro-life community feels that way, but if we don\u2019t have exceptions, we\u2019re going to end up with that initiative enshrined in our constitution forever.\u201d As she walked back to her car, Brandi Weed, a 54-year-old activities coordinator who drove in from Mesa with her husband to attend the event, said they share the same values as Lake and enjoy the freedoms she\u2019s fighting for. Weed said that though she struggled with the idea of abortions being performed, she understood Lake\u2019s point about exceptions. \u201cI see it from a Christian point of view,\u201d she said. \u201cI just think that, to get us closer to where there\u2019s no abortion, that would be wonderful. To cut all that in half, at least we\u2019re going in the right direction.\u201d A political mistake As Democrats focus on abortion, Lake has focused on the border, crime and the economy. She and her allies have tried to make the case to Republicans and center-right independents that Gallego is too liberal for the state, where Republicans outnumber Democrats and independents make up a third of the electorate. They\u2019ve pointed to his past support for ending cash bail and the filibuster, his Congressional Progressive Caucus membership, which he ended late last year, and his opposition to Trump\u2019s plan to build a border wall, which he called \u201cstupid.\u201d In a more personal attack, Lake has repeatedly criticized Gallego over his 2016 divorce from Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego when she was pregnant with their son, calling him a \u201cDeadbeat Dad.\u201d Mayor Gallego has endorsed the congressman\u2019s Senate bid. Gallego, who represents a deep blue Phoenix-area district, has taken a more moderate approach to immigration and law enforcement policy in recent years, including pushing for funding for law enforcement and border patrol agents and supporting the failed bipartisan border security bill backed by Biden. He was also one of 37 House Democrats who voted for the Laken Riley Act. The bill, named for a young woman allegedly killed by a man in the country illegally, would require the detention migrants arrested for burglary or theft. In interviews, Arizona Democrats argued\u00a0it will be difficult to paint a veteran,\u00a0who served in one of the hardest hit battalions in the war,\u00a0as too far left for the state. \u201cRuben Gallego is a Marine combat veteran who has always put Arizonans first,\u201d Goss, the Gallego spokesperson, said in a statement. \u201cKari Lake will do or say anything to get power, but her actions are clear: she supports banning abortion, continues to challenge the results of the 2020 and 2022 elections, and cannot bring people together to solve our most pressing problems.\u201d Gallego has spent $7.4 million on TV over the last eight weeks sharing his story with voters of being raised by a single mother, attending Harvard and deploying to Iraq after joining the Marine Reserves. The Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC that helps elect Democrats, has also reserved another $23 million to air in the fall. Lake\u2019s campaign plans to get on the air later this month. Overall, Gallego has raised $20.8 million since entering the race last January, while Lake has raised $5.7 million since launching her bid in October, according to FEC reports through March. Sean Noble, an Arizona-based Republican strategist, described Gallego as a better campaigner than\u00a0Hobbs,\u00a0with\u00a0a more compelling backstory. But a run-of-the-mill Republican would be able to beat him. \u201cHe\u2019s got a real record of very liberal votes that should make it easy, in a state like Arizona, to campaign against,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if Lake\u2019s the nominee, she has so many faults that she won\u2019t be able to pull it together.\u201d Noble and other Republican and center-right independent critics said Lake has too often practiced the politics of subtraction, not addition. During her last campaign Lake famously alienated the wing of the party loyal to the\u00a0late Sen. John McCain. \u201cMy view on this is she\u2019s not the first person to make a political mistake,\u201d said Seth Leibsohn, a conservative radio host who backed Lake after she won the 2022 gubernatorial primary. Leibsohn argued that Lake\u2019s criticisms of McCain\u2019s policies were taken by some as an attack on his biography and service to the country. He\u2019s now volunteering for Lake\u2019s campaign, introducing her at fundraisers and publishing op-eds urging Republicans to rally around her. His argument has been that Gallego is too liberal on a number of issues, including abortion and the state\u2019s upcoming abortion rights ballot initiative. \u201cA lot of Republicans are afraid of the issue, they just get nervous,\u201d he said. \u201cKari Lake is not afraid of issues and is a tremendously gifted spokesman. I think she\u2019ll be ultimately very helpful for the pro-life side of this debate.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/politics/kari-lake-arizona-senate-abortion/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_05_13_politics_abortion-ads-democratic-group-trump", "text": "A Democratic super PAC is launching a $25 million advertising blitz in three swing states, featuring voter testimonials about former President Donald Trump\u2019s role in curbing abortion access. The ads from American Bridge 21st Century mark the first wave of a larger, planned $140 million campaign by the group to persuade swing voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to reject Trump\u2019s bid to return to the White House. President Joe Biden flipped all three states in 2020. The ads, which the group says will target women voters living in rural and exurban areas of the three states, represent the latest effort by Democrats to use emotional, straight-to-the-camera stories to sway election outcomes since the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. American Bridge co-founder Bradley Beychok said the group has recruited hundreds of voters \u201cwilling to share their stories about why another Trump White House would be so devastating for them.\u201d Trump\u2019s nomination of three conservatives to the high court paved the way for the Dobbs decision overturning the federal right to abortion, which has emerged as one of the most contentious issues in politics. Biden\u2019s campaign has sought to make it the defining issue of the 2024 election. While Trump has said he was \u201cproudly the person responsible\u201d for the court\u2019s action, the former president has said decisions on limits to abortion should be left up to the states. He also has declined to say how he would vote on an abortion access measure on the ballot this fall in Florida, where he resides. In some cases, the American Bridge ads juxtapose Trump\u2019s words with those voters. In one, a Wisconsin woman named Anna \u2013 described as an OB-GYN and mother of two \u2013 tearfully describes having to terminate a wanted pregnancy because the baby she was carrying would not survive. \u201cThat\u2019s not a decision for any politician, including Donald Trump,\u201d she says. In another commercial, Lori \u2013 who has worked as a nurse in central Pennsylvania \u2013 frets about the impact of Dobbs on her daughter and granddaughter. \u201cWe\u2019re already moving backwards,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we reelect Trump, what are women going to lose next?\u201d American Bridge officials say the ads are aimed at four kinds of voters: moderates, those who swing between Democrats and Republicans, conservatives who dislike the hard-right rhetoric espoused by some Republicans, and a group they call \u201cdouble doubters,\u201d which they define as voters who aren\u2019t excited about either Trump or Biden. In all, the group has a $200 million budget for its anti-Trump efforts in the 2024 election, including its previously announced $140 million advertising campaign. Officials say another wave of testimonial-style ads will roll out this summer in these three battlegrounds.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/politics/abortion-ads-democratic-group-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_11_politics_trump-rally-new-jersey", "text": "Former President Donald Trump held a beachfront rally on the Jersey Shore on Saturday, returning to the campaign trail after an explosive week of testimony in his hush money trial in New York. The\u00a0event\u00a0in Wildwood, located in South New Jersey, marks Trump\u2019s third campaign rally since the start of his trial four weeks ago. Unlike Michigan and Wisconsin, where Trump held rallies last week, New Jersey is not considered a battleground\u00a0state. Trump\u00a0lost the Garden State by about 16 points to President Joe Biden in 2020. Still, Trump claimed he could win the state as he spoke to the crowd in Wildwood, part of Cape May County, which is in a New Jersey district that is much friendlier to Republicans. Trump won the county in 2020 with 57.5% of the vote, and 58.4% in 2016. \u201cWe\u2019re expanding the electoral map because we\u2019re going to officially play in the state of New Jersey,\u201d the presumptive Republican presidential nominee said. We\u2019re going to win the state of New Jersey.\u201d In interviews with CNN ahead of the rally, some Republicans\u00a0questioned the decision by the campaign to spend one of Trump\u2019s limited days off from court campaigning in a state that has voted Democratic in the last seven straight presidential elections. But a Trump campaign official said the campaign sees an opportunity to tap into the nearby media market in the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania and get local TV coverage in Philadelphia. They expected the crowd to include attendees from the city and suburbs of Philadelphia, which is about an hour and a half drive from Wildwood. During his remarks, the former president praised North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, for his energy knowledge and told the crowd to \u201cget ready for something.\u201d \u201cYou won\u2019t find anybody better than this gentleman in terms of his knowledge of, you know he made his money in technology, but he probably knows more about energy than anybody I know. So, get ready for something, okay, just get ready. But Doug Burgum has been incredible,\u201d Trump said. Burgum, who ran for president this cycle but suspended his campaign after failing to gain any real traction, is one of several people being speculated as a potential running mate for Trump. Saturday wasn\u2019t Trump\u2019s first time campaigning in the city. In January 2020, Trump held a rally in Wildwood in an effort to support the city\u2019s congressman, Rep. Jeff Van Drew, who shocked his House colleagues in 2019 when he switched his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican during Trump\u2019s first impeachment trial and pledged his \u201cundying support\u201d to the then-president. In the years since, Trump has maintained a good relationship with Van Drew and continues to praise his decision to switch parties,\u00a0something the former president often characterizes as an example of Democrats being fed up with the left, according to sources familiar with the comments. The former Democrat is leading the Trump campaign\u2019s efforts in New Jersey and spoke at the rally Saturday. Trump slammed his November rival at the rally as he doubled down on his support for Israel in its war in Gaza, which he said is \u201cprobably bad politically, but I don\u2019t care.\u201d The former president told the crowd that Biden committed \u201cone of the worst betrayals of an American ally in the history of our country\u201d by saying the US would halt some shipments of weapons to Israel if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered a major invasion of the city of Rafah. \u201cCrooked Joe\u2019s action is one of the worst betrayals of an American ally in the history of our country. I support Israel\u2019s right to win its war on terror. Is that ok? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s good or bad politically, I don\u2019t care. You gotta do what\u2019s right,\u201d Trump said. Despite Trump and his campaign\u2019s insistence that the former president would take advantage of every second he wasn\u2019t tied to his trial,\u00a0the presumptive Republican presidential nominee has not taken full advantage of his off days from court to campaign. Instead, he\u2019s spent much of his free time fundraising, including speaking at a luncheon at his Mar-a-Lago club during the Republican National Committee\u2019s annual retreat last weekend\u00a0and playing golf at his Bedminster club on a recent Wednesday. Trump insulted Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who brought the hush money case against him, and declared that \u201cthis case is a sham.\u201d \u201cAs you know, I\u2019ve come here from New York, where I\u2019m being forced to endure a Biden show trial all done by Biden \u2026 all being done by him, carried out by radical Democrat district attorney, you know who he is? Fat Alvin. Corrupt guy,\u201d Trump said, going on to baselessly claim that the judge presiding over the trial is \u201chighly conflicted.\u201d Some people close to Trump have acknowledged that they are surprised by the dearth of traditional campaigning on the sidelines of the trial, especially given\u00a0that\u00a0the general election is less than six months away. They also raised questions about the campaign choosing to spend one of his weekends away from court in New Jersey, rather than one of the more crucial 2024 battlegrounds. \u201cIt\u2019s an odd choice,\u201d one of the people said. \u201cBut this is Trump being Trump. He loves New Jersey and Atlantic City.\u201d Republican strategist Matt Gorman, a former senior adviser to South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott\u2019s presidential campaign, told CNN the proximity of Wildwood to his trial in Manhattan, as well as his golf club in Bedminster, likely also played a factor. \u201cIt\u2019s a chance for him to be in Trump Country that\u2019s close to Bedminster and probably a lot cheaper than having to fly and set up an event in a swing state,\u201d Gorman said.

{"id": "2024_05_09_politics_bidens-rafah-warning-is-turning-point-in-us-israel-relations-and-a-belated-but-inevitable-rupture-with-netanyahu", "text": "US-Israel relations have reached a critical crossroads that shows that even President Joe Biden\u2019s staunch support can reach its limits when it starts to conflict with wider American national security and moral interests \u2014 and his own dicey political position. Biden\u2019s warning in an interview with CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett that he\u2019d halt some weapons shipments to Israel if it invades the Gazan city of Rafah marks the most direct US attempt to rein in its ally in a national security crisis since the Reagan administration, and the first significant conditioning of American military assistance since the start of the war. Biden\u2019s statement of his ultimate red line takes his trial of strength with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to its most intense level yet and sent immediate shockwaves through US and Israeli politics and around the world. Washington fears a full-scale Israeli incursion into densely populated Rafah would cause civilian casualties on a level even greater than the 34,000 Palestinians the Gaza Health Ministry reports have already been killed in the Israeli war on Hamas. The city is already \u201changing on the edge of a precipice,\u201d a senior United Nations official told CNN Thursday. Hospitals are overstretched as Palestinians die in Israeli attacks on the suburbs and tens of thousands of people have already fled. The civilian carnage in the Gaza war has caused outrage globally and generated extreme pressure on Biden at home that threatens to splinter his Democratic coalition as he wages a neck-and-neck reelection campaign against Donald Trump. Republicans are already accusing the president of appeasing terrorists following his comments. Despite US concerns, Netanyahu\u2019s government says it has no choice but to finish its assault on Hamas, which embeds itself in civilian areas \u2014 including in Rafah \u2014 where key leaders are hunkered down in tunnels. For Netanyahu, the eradication of the group that carried out the October 7 attacks may be a matter of political survival. The major questions now after this tectonic shift in the US-Israel relationship are: \u2022 Will Biden\u2019s move affect Israel\u2019s decision-making as it stages air and ground operations in Rafah that could be seen as the precursor to a full offensive? \u2022 Can Israel \u2014 as Netanyahu vows \u2014 go ahead alone in an operation even the US has disowned? \u2022 Longer-term, will Biden\u2019s move be a temporary blip in his relations with the Jewish state\u2019s hard-right government or a full-scale rupture between Israel and the US? \u2022 How would a full-scale offensive in Rafah further hamper already faltering attempts to secure a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas? Would it rupture US hopes of a regional compact between Israel and Arab states? And could an operation that kills hundreds of civilians set the regional temperature boiling again and raise fresh fears of a regional war? \u2022 In the US, will Biden\u2019s belated attempt to impose direct pressure on Netanyahu over his defiance towards US concerns do anything to alleviate the president\u2019s vulnerable political stranding in his own party as Republicans pummel him with exaggerated claims that he\u2019s turning his back on Israel? Biden\u2019s comments send political reverberations around the world Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli consul general in New York, told CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson that the public estrangement between Biden and Netanyahu over Rafah represented one of the difficult moments ever in US-Israel relations. \u201cI do think this is a very low point \u2014 could the relationship survive this? Yes. Could it do so while Netanyahu is in power? No,\u201d Pinkas said. Initially, Biden\u2019s warning, delivered in an interview with CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett in the swing state of Wisconsin on Wednesday, looks like a case of political whiplash. On Tuesday, during a speech memorializing the Holocaust, Biden said that his \u201ccommitment to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad. Even when we disagree.\u201d Yet a day later, the president seemed to be sending a contradictory message. The two statements however need to be considered together, and the key phrase is \u201ceven when we disagree.\u201d The president is apparently seeking to create political space where he can alleviate fierce electoral pressure within his party and internationally, satisfy moral aspirations to shield civilians, head off a wider Middle East war while also honoring his long-term commitment to Israeli security. But given the treacherous entanglement of the worst attack on Israel\u2019s security in decades and international and domestic politics, many of these goals may be irreconcilable. Biden\u2019s biggest break with Netanyahu is a moment that was always coming \u2014 even if it took months to arrive and was engineered reluctantly on the US president\u2019s part. The critical political interests of the US and Israeli leaders \u2014 both of whose hold on office is threatened by the war \u2014 are diverging. The president and top officials repeatedly warned his counterpart against a Rafah offensive. And his authority and credibility as a global leader depends on Biden standing behind his warnings after Netanyahu has repeatedly ignored US calls to temper the intensity of the Gaza war. Biden\u2019s statement also implies a judgement that US national interests now depend on not being seen as an accessory to the worsening of an already epochal humanitarian disaster in Gaza that has put the United States at odds with many allies in Europe and the Middle East and erode its pretension to global leadership. The president also has massive political problems. While the Israel-Gaza war is far from the top issue preoccupying American voters, the likely tight race with Trump means that the race could be decided by a few thousands votes in the pivotal swing states among tens of millions cast nationally. And the demographic groups most exercised by the civilian cost of the war and the plight of Palestinians are young, progressive and Arab Americans voters in Michigan \u2014 a state that could decide the election. These are exactly the people that the president can least afford to lose. Biden has already been called \u201cGenocide Joe\u201d at campaign events that are frequently interrupted by protests. The wave of pro-Palestinian demonstrations at college campuses are playing into Trump\u2019s claims that the US is beset by left-wing extremism and chaos that Biden can\u2019t control. And any mass protests at the Democratic convention in Chicago in August would conjure painful omens for Biden, even if the unrest and anti-Vietnam war fury around the same event in the same venue in 1968 that helped propel a Republican to the White House that year aren\u2019t an exact historical analogy. Israel\u2019s next move Israel\u2019s war cabinet was due to meet Thursday in a session that will offer members of Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing coalition an opportunity to vent over Biden\u2019s decision. Militarily, and given its reserves of weaponry and ammunition, the government may have all the materiel that it needs to go into Rafah. Even so, Israel\u2019s ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, said Thursday that the US move could impair his country\u2019s moves to reach its objectives. Israel must also consider whether an invasion of Rafah absent US cover would further fracture the global sympathy it received after the October 7 terror attacks. Such a step could shatter already long-shot negotiations for a ceasefire with Hamas and the return of remaining Israeli hostages and its wider geopolitical aspirations. But Netanyahu\u2019s mindset has long been that the Hamas attacks represent an attempt to wipe Israel off the map and he sees an existential threat to Judaism, even if the rest of the world does not share his view. Israel has so far given no indication that it will change its plans. For instance, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant warned Thursday: \u201cI turn to Israel\u2019s enemies as well as to our best of friends and say \u2013 the state of Israel cannot be subdued, not the IDF, not the defense establishment.\u201d But if any large-scale invasion of Rafah creates the humanitarian catastrophe that the United States fears, Israel will be left on its own to take the heat after ignoring concerns of the administration and publicly and repeatedly dissing Biden. A GOP backlash reflects Netanyahu\u2019s politicking The immediate and angry reaction to Biden\u2019s comments to CNN from Republicans underscored Netanyahu\u2019s years of playing politics in Washington and his allying of his Likud Party with fellow travelers in the GOP. House Speaker Mike Johnson accused Biden on CNBC of defying the will of Congress by threatening to halt weapons shipments and of \u201ctrying to dictate \u2026 and micromanage the war, the defense effort in Israel, as a condition of supplying the weapons that we all know that they desperately need.\u201d Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, charged Biden in a Truth Social post of \u201ctaking the side of these terrorists, just like he has sided with the Radical Mobs taking over our college campuses, because his donors are funding them.\u201d As he arrived for another day of his hush money trial in New York, Trump added that any American Jews who voted for Biden should be ashamed, repeating a trope that is offensive to many in the community who have deep bonds with Israel but do not support Netanyahu\u2019s hardline government. The charge that Biden is harming Israeli security is tough to stand up, given his half century of support for the Jewish state and his forbearance of Netanyahu\u2019s frequent public rebukes and attempts to undermine him \u2014 and previous Democratic presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama in Washington. Just last month, Biden ordered a massive US and allied air operation to shield Israel from a wave of drones and cruise and ballistic missiles sent from Iran in response to its assassination of senior Iranian military intelligence officers in a diplomatic compound in Damascus. And Biden recently signed a multi-billion-dollar arms and ammunition package for Israel that he requested from Congress. Some observers are pointing to parallels between Republican President Ronald Reagan\u2019s delay of shipments of weapons and warplanes to Israel to protest its conduct of its war in Lebanon in the early 1980s. But that showdown took place at a time when US-Israeli relations were far less politicized in Israel or the United States and came with far less political harm to the former president than the current one. Among progressive Democrats, the initial reaction to Biden\u2019s move was positive but not effusive. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a leader of the progressive movement, said that the threat of withholding arms was \u201can important step in the right direction by President Biden to halt the shipment of bombs to Israel.\u201d But the political consequences of the president\u2019s handling of the Israel-Hamas war may be so profound that it could be too late to change them. For many voters, the suffering of the Palestinians in Gaza is a searing moral issue that will not be erased by the president\u2019s belated pressure on Netanyahu. The crisis is one of the most intractable international political dramas to afflict any president in his reelection year in recent memory. And it hands Biden a set of unpalatable choices from which it will be almost impossible for him to emerge politically unscathed.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/politics/bidens-rafah-warning-is-turning-point-in-us-israel-relations-and-a-belated-but-inevitable-rupture-with-netanyahu/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_11_politics_school-budget-cuts-teacher-layoffs", "text": "Schools across the country are announcing teacher and staff layoffs as districts brace for the end of a pandemic aid package that delivered the largest one-time federal investment in K-12 education. The funds must be used by the end of September, creating a sharp funding cliff as schools also struggle with widespread enrollment declines and inflation. Many districts have warned of layoffs as the current school year comes to a close and next year\u2019s budgets are planned. The local headlines about teachers likely won\u2019t help Americans who remain stubbornly pessimistic about the economy feel any better, adding to the challenge President Joe Biden faces to show voters how things are better than they were four years ago. In Missoula, Montana, for example, the public school district is considering cutting 33 teaching positions and 13 administrative positions, including its special education director and fine arts director, as it faces a budget shortfall. \u201cThe last time that MCPS (Missoula County Public Schools) saw these types of reductions was almost a generation ago,\u201d superintendent Micah Hill said at a school board meeting earlier this year. Not only is the federal funding ending, but enrollment at the district\u2019s schools has fallen by nearly 500 students \u2013 or roughly 5% \u2013 since 2019. At the same time, the district is facing rising insurance and utility costs, Hill said in a statement sent to CNN. In Arlington, Texas, the public school district will cut 275 positions at the end of this school year that were funded by the federal pandemic aid funds. They include staff that helped provide after-school care, tutoring and mental health services. The district, which employs about 8,500 staff in total, has said that employees affected by the layoffs can apply to other available positions. And in Hartford, Connecticut, 30 teachers and 79 other staff members have been notified that they have lost their jobs. In total, about 384 positions will be cut, though some of them were already vacant and others won\u2019t be filled after a staff member retires or leaves. Enrollment at Hartford Public Schools is down 21% since 2010 due to a decline in the school-age population and a policy that allows Hartford residents to enroll at schools in neighboring districts. \u201cThat is a long-term problem that has been exacerbated by the ESSER cliff,\u201d superintendent Leslie Torres-Rodriguez said in a statement sent to CNN. ESSER, or Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief, refers to the grant program that provided the federal pandemic-related relief funds. Pandemic aid comes to an end After the Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020, Congress authorized three rounds of federal funding to help K-12 schools respond. Between March 2020 and March 2021, lawmakers authorized\u00a0$190 billion in funding for K-12 schools\u00a0\u2013 roughly six times what they receive from the federal government in a normal year. At first, many districts used the money to reopen school buildings by buying masks and cleaning supplies and upgrading HVAC systems. The last and biggest round of funding, which was approved in 2021, required districts to spend at least 20% of the money to address learning loss \u2013 which could have included tutoring programs, summer school or extended school days. Districts were given more than three years to spend the third round of money, with few other restrictions. It was largely up to local school boards to decide how to spend the funds on a broad range of pandemic-related needs, and they could choose to hire new teachers and staff even though they knew the funding would eventually dry up. Although districts are required to report how they are spending the money, the reports often lack details, making it hard to track how many teachers were hired with the federal funding. But a new report from CALDER, an education research center, that looked at Washington state found that roughly 12,000 positions, including more than 5,000 classroom teachers, were created with the federal funding. \u201cThose are people that would not have been hired if that extra funding did not exist,\u201d said Dan Goldhaber, one of the authors of the report. Districts that created new positions now need to decide how \u2013 and if \u2013 to fund them going forward. How many teachers are at risk? It may seem counterintuitive to be concerned about teacher layoffs when many districts have been struggling to fill open positions \u2013 especially in math, science and special education subjects and in rural areas. But that\u2019s partly because some districts, flush with pandemic funding, have been adding positions while enrollment in public schools has been declining nationally. It\u2019s hard to know just how many educator jobs are at risk across the country. But if staffing levels were to fall back to the same levels they were before the pandemic in 2018-19, districts would need to lay off 384,000 full-time staff, according to Chad Aldeman, an education analyst. Who could get hit the hardest? The federal pandemic aid law directs states to disburse the money like they do Title I funding, which means more money goes to districts with more low-income families \u2013 and those could be the ones facing the biggest budget shortfalls now. \u201cStudents of color and students who are attending higher-poverty districts are going to be the ones to feel the brunt of the layoffs,\u201d said Heather Peske, president of the National Council on Teacher Quality. And when districts lay off staff, many fire the most recent hires. Peske said it\u2019s better if districts approach layoffs with the performance of teachers in mind. \u201cWe know that if they\u2019re using seniority as the only criteria, they could be laying off teachers who are highly effective \u2013 and this will leave students at a major disadvantage,\u201d Peske said. She also recommends protecting those staff members who are in high demand, like math and special education teachers.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/politics/school-budget-cuts-teacher-layoffs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_politics_takeaways-friday-may-10-trump-trial", "text": "One of Donald Trump\u2019s closest White House aides wrapped up her testimony Friday in the former president\u2019s hush money trial, clearing the way for the prosecution\u2019s key witness to take the stand on Monday. Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former fixer and lawyer, is expected to testify Monday, according to a person familiar with the case, where he will speak to the hush money agreement he helped negotiate in 2016 with Stormy Daniels and how Trump repaid him the following year. Cohen\u2019s testimony is the lynchpin to prosecutors\u2019 charges that Trump illegally falsified business records by concealing the reimbursement of Cohen to keep the payments hidden before the 2016 election. In anticipation of calling the former president\u2019s onetime fixer, however, prosecutors introduced a slew of text messages and phone records into evidence for the jury, via several custodial witnesses. Prosecutors say it\u2019s entirely possible they could rest their case by the end of next week. Here are the takeaways from day 15 of the Trump hush money trial: Cohen is on deck Cohen is expected to take the stand Monday, putting him face-to-face with his former boss. He is expected to testify to his role in negotiating the hush money payment to Daniels on Trump\u2019s behalf, as well as how he was reimbursed through retainer payments in 2017 that are at the heart of the charges against Trump. With Cohen\u2019s testimony implicating Trump, however, comes all of the baggage that accompanies the former president\u2019s longtime fixer. Cohen himself was federally charged with campaign finance violations, tax crimes and lying to Congress in previous testimony. He\u2019s changed his story as he turned from loyal Trump defender to chief antagonist after pleading guilty to the federal charges in 2018. His testimony in the fall during Trump\u2019s civil fraud trial foreshadowed some of the challenges prosecutors can face having him on the stand, as he appeared to change his story about the direction he received from Trump about his financial statements during his testimony. Cohen\u2019s credibility with the jury may make-or-break Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s case, so it will be high stakes for the prosecution when Cohen is sworn in next week. Judge to Cohen: Please stop talking Ahead of Cohen\u2019s expected testimony, Trump attorney Todd Blanche urged Judge Juan Merchan to order Cohen to stop talking about the trial and Trump. Trump is not allowed to talk about Cohen because of the gag order in place. But, Blanche said, Cohen is nevertheless allowed to attack him, pointing to a TikTok video Cohen posted this week wearing a T-shirt showing Trump behind bars. \u201cOur request that the court order the government to instruct the witness to not talk about president trump or this case until the case is over,\u201d Blanche said. Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass responded that prosecutors have repeatedly instructed Cohen and all of the other witnesses in the case not to speak publicly about it. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, we have no control over what they do,\u201d he conceded. Merchan has already said he cannot gag witnesses in the case. But he sympathized with Blanche\u2019s position and said that he would \u201cdirect the people to communicate to Mr. Cohen that the judge is asking him to refrain from making any more statements\u201d about this case or Trump. Merchan told the prosecutors to send the message saying that it \u201ccomes from the bench and you\u2019re communicating that on behalf of the bench.\u201d Cohen has posted on social media attacking Trump since the trial began, though he claimed at one point he was going to stop. Trump, often in response, has repeatedly been found in violation of the judge\u2019s gag order for his comments about Cohen. Trump is all smiles at testimony of former White House aide Trump exchanged smiles with his former White House assistant Madeleine Westerhout, who wrapped up her testimony Friday that began one day prior. She raised her eyebrows and smiled at Trump who smiled back at her and mouthed something as she left the courtroom. On cross-examination, Trump attorney Susan Necheles pressed Westerhout to reiterate that she knows the former president to care about his family. Westerhout testified that she remembered Trump was upset after the Stormy Daniels story came out in 2018. Westerhout acknowledged on the stand that he didn\u2019t specifically speak about his family in their conversation about the story, but, \u201cMy understanding was he knew it would be hurtful to his family.\u201d Westerhout testified that Trump signed scores of documents a day while multitasking on the phone or in meetings, and she said she\u2019d seen him signing checks without reviewing them. She also testified that personal mail like Trump\u2019s checks used a back channel via an employee\u2019s home address so he could get and handle them faster than if they were processed by the White House\u2019s cumbersome system for processing personal mail. Westerhout also distanced Trump from then-Trump Org. Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg once he took office. \u201cIn fact, you really don\u2019t recall any calls specifically between him and Allen Weisselberg?\u201d Necheles asked. \u201cNo, he spoke to so many people,\u201d Westerhout said. Trump\u2019s former assistant said she\u2019s \u201cnot even sure it\u2019s true\u201d that Trump spoke with Weisselberg about a check \u2013 something prosecutors have suggested in reference to the Cohen reimbursements. Prosecutors introduce key text and call records into evidence After Westerhout left the stand, prosecutors spent the rest of the day calling a series of custodial witnesses to introduce cell phone records into evidence. It made for a dry day of testimony, but it also provided key evidence that prosecutors plan to use to try to convince the jury that Trump is guilty of falsifying business records. Those records included a summary of the 34 charges against Trump \u2013 11 invoices, 12 vouchers, and 11 checks. Through a Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office paralegal, prosecutors introduced a summary explaining how the charges correlated with the documents in evidence. In addition, prosecutors introduced a series of text messages between Stormy Daniels\u2019 then-manager Gina Rodriguez and National Enquirer editor in chief Dylan Howard in 2016. In the messages, the two discuss whether American Media Inc. would buy Daniels\u2019 story \u2013 and for how much \u2013 before giving a play-by-play of the status of the negotiations and payment Cohen ultimately made to Daniels\u2019 attorney in late October 2016. The texts are notable because neither Howard nor Rodriguez is expected to testify in the trial. Some of the texts were introduced through David Pecker, who was Howard\u2019s boss, but prosecutors used a paralegal to show more of them to the jury this week. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing the Trump deal,\u201d Rodriguez texted Howard on October 17, 2016. \u201cKeith (Davidson) gave me a heads up. What happened?\u201d Howard responded. \u201cThey didn\u2019t pay when they said they would and they keep trying to buy more time,\u201d Rodriguez responded. The texts corroborate what Daniels and Davidson have testified so far that the deal briefly fell apart in mid-October \u2013 and will also likely help bolster Cohen\u2019s credibility when he takes the stand next week. Prosecution may rest next week, but issue with former Trump Org. CFO looms Steinglass said that prosecutors expect to call two more witnesses, and then rest. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s entirely possible we will rest by the end of next week,\u201d he added. When the prosecution rests, it will be Trump\u2019s turn. It\u2019s not clear how long he will put on a case in defense \u2013 a question that is likely to rest largely on whether or not Trump himself takes the stand. The judge also threw a potential curveball of his own on Friday when Trump\u2019s lawyers objected to allowing the settlement agreement of Weisselberg into evidence. Trump\u2019s lawyers argued that the severance agreement was prejudicial to the jury, calling Weisselberg an \u201cuncalled government witness\u201d because he is currently in jail after pleading guilty earlier this year to perjury charges. Prosecutors responded that the settlement agreement itself would help to explain why Weisselberg was not called and also argued that they expect Weisselberg to invoke his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination. Merchan interjected by asking prosecutors whether they had actually compelled Weisselberg to testify, which they had not. \u201cIt seems to me we want to explain why he\u2019s not here without taking the effort of trying to explain that we tried to get him here,\u201d Merchan said, suggesting they could bring Weisselberg in without the jury present to see what he would say. Prosecutors did not seem thrilled by the idea \u2013 Trump\u2019s attorneys noted he wasn\u2019t on prosecutors\u2019 original witness list \u2013 but it\u2019s the kind of unexpected appearance that could extend the length of the trial.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/politics/takeaways-friday-may-10-trump-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_06_politics_biden-israel-partisan-split-analysis", "text": "President Joe Biden is facing more critical moments this week that will test his fraught relationship with his base over Israel\u2019s war in Gaza and potentially widen the partisan split about the Jewish state that has been building for years. Long before the current conflict, polls showed that sympathies among rank-and-file Democrats have been shifting from Israel toward the Palestinians over roughly the past two decades\u00a0\u2014 a period that coincides with almost unbroken right-leaning governments in Israel, mostly led by current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Simultaneously, support for Israel over that same long period has markedly increased among rank-and-file Republican voters. As a result, over twice as many Republican as Democratic voters now say they sympathize more with Israel than with the Palestinians, a much bigger gap between the parties than earlier in this century, according to Gallup Organization polling. This widening partisan chasm in the United States suggests that whenever Netanyahu leaves the political stage in Israel, an inescapable part of his legacy will be a leading role in shattering the bipartisan consensus that for decades provided Israel an almost unassailable position in US politics. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the drivers of the US-Israeli relationship that have accounted for its resilience, its special quality and character over the years, are more under stress than at any point in my government experience or even out of government,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who has advised six secretaries of state on the Mideast. That rising pressure could make Biden the last of his kind: Though the vast majority of Democratic office-holders show no penchant to fundamentally break with Israel, Biden could be the last Democratic president for the foreseeable future who aligns so unreservedly with the nation. He\u2019s expected to make a speech on antisemitism on Tuesday at an event sponsored by the Holocaust Memorial Museum. Meanwhile, Democratic critics of his handling of the war will be watching on Wednesday when his administration is due to report to Congress on whether Israel is using US weapons in accordance with international law and is cooperating with the delivery of humanitarian aid. Biden\u2019s deep personal bond with Israel already makes him a throwback in US politics. In the first half century after Israel\u2019s formation in 1948, it was Democratic presidents such as Harry Truman, Lyndon B. Johnson, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton who displayed the greatest emotional connection to the Jewish state. Republican presidents including Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush also supported Israel but more overtly qualified that support when it conflicted with their other regional goals of preserving access to oil and repelling Soviet influence; Reagan and Bush each at points protested Israeli actions they opposed by temporarily withholding aid. Over roughly the past quarter century this partisan pattern has inverted. Republican Presidents George W. Bush and Donald Trump have identified most thoroughly with Israel, while Clinton (in his second term) and Barack Obama experienced the most disagreements with the Israeli government. Many factors have contributed to this reversal of roles. Bush\u2019s campaign against Islamic extremism after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks encouraged him to place more value on Israel as a regional ally. Growing identification with Israel among US White evangelical Christians, a key GOP constituency, also nudged the party toward greater support for the Jewish state. Conversely, more voters in the Democratic coalition (both racial minorities and liberal Whites) came to see Israel\u2019s treatment of the occupied Palestinian territories as colonial, or even apartheid-type, oppression. While holding the prime minister position in the late 1990s and then again with only brief interruption since 2009, Netanyahu has also played a huge personal role in prompting this American partisan reversal. Netanyahu has pursued staunchly conservative policies within Israel (such as his attempt to weaken the judiciary that triggered massive nationwide protest) and rebuffed pressure from successive Democratic presidents to negotiate an independent Palestinian state. As important, he has aligned with the Republican Party as overtly as any foreign leader has with either political party in modern times. Netanyahu in 2015, for instance, delivered a speech to Congress opposing the Iran nuclear deal at the invitation of House Republicans \u2014 over express objections from Obama. And Netanyahu recently echoed Republican talking points at a news conference when he dismissed the protests about the war on US campuses as simply widespread antisemitism. Against this backdrop, partisan polarization about Israel among American voters was already widening years before the brutal Hamas attack last October and the devastating Israeli response it triggered. One measure is the annual Gallup polls that ask Americans whether they sympathize mostly with Israel or mostly with the Palestinians. In 2001, the share of Republican voters who said they sympathized mostly with Israel exceeded the share of Democrats by only eight percentage points (59% vs. 51%.) By Obama\u2019s second term, Republican partisans were over 20 points more likely than Democrats to say they sympathized mostly with Israel. The gap between the parties in sympathy for Israel expanded under Trump to nearly 40 points, and it has soared to 45 points under Biden \u2014 nearly six times the difference in 2001. In the 2023 and 2024 surveys, Gallup recorded for the first time that the share of Democrats who sympathized mostly with the Palestinians exceeded the share who mostly favored Israel. Another long-running survey series from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs found similar, though not quite as extensive, movement. In 2002, the share of Republicans who said the US should take Israel\u2019s side in the conflict was roughly double the percentage of Democrats; in the latest survey, \u00a0conducted this February, the gap had grown to about 3-to-1. The survey found that the share of Democrats who said the US should align with Israel in the conflict, after falling through the Trump years, rebounded to nearly 1-in-5 in the latest poll, almost exactly its level in the early 2000s. But as many Democrats now say the US should side with the Palestinians \u2013 a view held by just 1-in-50 Democrats in 2002. (That\u2019s also the same share of Republicans today\u00a0 who say the US should side with the Palestinians.) Most Democrats said the US should not take either side in the conflict \u2014 a view shared by only about two-fifths of Republicans. An array of polls this spring show how the war in Gaza has hardened this partisan split. \u00a0Earlier this year, both Quinnipiac University and CBS/YouGov polls found that while about 55% of Republicans wanted the US to send more military aid to Israel, about two-thirds of Democrats did not. Nearly half of Democrats, but only a little over one-fifth of Republicans in the CBS poll, said the US should pressure Israel to stop the fighting. While a slim majority of Republicans expressed confidence in Netanyahu in an April Pew survey, over 7-in-10 Democrats said they had little or no faith in the Israeli leader \u201dto do the right thing.\u201d In the Quinnipiac survey just 5% of Democrats said they had a favorable view of Netanyahu; the number was 11 times as high among Republicans. All of the dividing lines separating the parties are also cleaving the generations. Just 1-in-12 young adults in the Quinnipiac poll said they had a favorable view of Netanyahu and over two-thirds opposed sending more arms to Israel; likewise, in the Pew survey about two-thirds of young adults said they viewed the Israeli government unfavorably. Gallup\u2019s latest poll found that while older adults still mostly favor Israel, a plurality of younger adults now express sympathy for the Palestinians. These shifts in attitudes within the Democratic coalition have only modestly changed behavior among the party\u2019s leading elected officials. Only 37 House Democrats ultimately voted against the recently approved foreign aid package that included over $26 billion in new military assistance to Israel. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, despite an earlier speech criticizing Netanyahu, is reportedly joining with House Speaker Mike Johnson to invite the Israeli leader to address a joint congressional session \u2014 an extraordinary opportunity given how many of Biden\u2019s requests Netanyahu has resisted since the war began. Liberal critics of Israel\u2019s approach to the Palestinians, both before and after the October 7 attacks, largely attribute the widening disconnect between Democratic voters and elected officials to the influence of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, and other pro-Israeli lobbying groups in Washington. Since the Obama presidency, AIPAC has become more aggressive in supporting primary campaigns against Democratic officials critical of Israel; it has pledged to spend $100 million this year to defeat members of Congress who have criticized Israel\u2019s conduct of the war most strongly such as Democratic Reps. Jamaal Bowman of New York and Cori Bush of Missouri. \u201cAIPAC\u2019s enormous financial and political pressure in Washington is the most important factor in slowing down larger numbers of Democratic officials from opposing Israel\u2019s war in Gaza,\u201d said Waleed Shahid, who has held senior positions in multiple liberal organizations and has been active in organizing opposition to the war. \u201cBy targeting Democrats who oppose a blank check of weapons funding to Israel, AIPAC aims to stall an inevitable generational shift within the party.\u201d Yet AIPAC\u2019s influence alone doesn\u2019t explain the distance opening between Democratic voters and officials. Part of the answer, as Shahid suggests, is generational. Biden personifies an older cohort of US political leaders whose image of Israel was formed when it was a lonely outpost of democracy and haven for Holocaust survivors. Ordinary Americans and US political leaders alike in the years of the 1967 and Yom Kippur (1973) wars tended to view Israel, in Miller\u2019s words, as a David barely fending off threatening Goliaths; now, many younger Democrats in particular believe \u201cIsrael is no longer David, it\u2019s Goliath,\u201d and it \u201cis pounding David\u201d in Gaza, Miller said. Older Democratic officials have been less influenced than younger ones by the emergence of that new perspective among their voters. Many observers also note that Biden tends to view foreign policy much as he does domestic politics \u2014 placing enormous confidence in his ability to leverage personal relationships with other leaders. \u201cBiden always says \u2018all foreign policy is an extension of personal relationships,\u2019\u201d said Ben Rhodes, who served as a senior National Security Council adviser while Biden served as Obama\u2019s vice president. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many times I heard him say that.\u201d Biden over the course of the war has more explicitly criticized Netanyahu and the far-right coalition that he is governing with, but he has still rebuffed rising demands within Democratic ranks to penalize Israel for its conduct of the war and resistance to the delivery of humanitarian aid. \u201cWe\u2019re almost at the seventh month of this war, and this administration has been reluctant to impose a single cost or consequence on this Israeli government that normal humans would regard as serious or significant pressure,\u201d said Miller. Instead, Miller added, Biden is still operating primarily from the belief that to achieve his goals in the region \u2014 more humanitarian aid into Gaza, a ceasefire that leads to further hostage releases and eventually a regional accord between Israel and Saudi Arabia \u2014 \u201che cannot do that by creating a sustained public breach with the Israeli prime minister. He needs Israel\u2019s acquiescence if not its active assistance.\u201d Biden allies also believe Israel\u2019s critics within the party are overstating the political risks of his continued support. Though polls show widespread opposition to the war among both young people and Democrats more broadly, they also usually show that those voters prioritize other issues more. \u201cWhile some elements of the party\u2019s activist core are focused on what\u2019s happening in Gaza, most Democrats and most Americans are not,\u201d said long-time Democratic pollster Mark Mellman, president of the Democratic Majority for Israel, a pro-Israeli group. \u201cRather they are seized with other issues \u2014 whether it\u2019s holding down prices or protecting abortion rights or protecting democracy itself. \u201c But as the war persists \u2014 with the wave of campus protests compounding the fractures over the issue in the Democratic coalition \u2014 there are clear signs the party\u2019s center of gravity is moving away from the instinctive support for Israel expressed by older Democrats such as Biden and Schumer. The telltale sign is not the escalating outrage over the war from liberals long critical of Netanyahu and far-right Israeli governments, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders and members of \u201cthe squad\u201d in the House. Rather the key measure is the willingness of ambitious mid-career Democrats closer to the party center to criticize Israel\u2019s conduct of the war more openly and to indicate support for limiting the future transfer of offensive weapons; the list of Democrats in that camp include Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Chris Coons of Delaware and Tim Kaine of Virginia. Biden only agreed to deliver the report due Wednesday on Israel\u2019s use of US weapons and cooperation with international aid after pressure from a group of about 20 Democratic senators led by Van Hollen. Though almost all Democratic senators voted for the recent military aid package for Israel, Biden risks alienating many who supported the assistance if Wednesday\u2019s report to Congress does not seriously address whether Israel should be penalized for its actions in the war, said Amanda Klasing, the national director of government relations and advocacy for Amnesty International. Amnesty recently issued a report charging that Israel has targeted civilians with US weapons in violation of international law. \u201cBiden has a Democratic caucus that is putting a lot of faith in this process,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have taken these votes under the assumption that these conditions will be applied by the administration.\u201d The Israeli prime minister\u2019s personal relationship with Trump is prickly, but Netanyahu\u2019s hardline approach toward both the Palestinians and Iran has encouraged the GOP\u2019s transformation into what Miller calls \u201cthe Israel can do no wrong party.\u201d If Israel elects a more centrist government in the future, Miller believes, the widening US partisan divide over Israel could narrow. But given the alienation about Israeli actions among Democratic partisans in general \u2014 and younger voters in particular \u2014 it seems virtually guaranteed that Democratic elected officials in the years ahead will face greater pressure than Republicans to maintain a critical distance from Israel. So far, Biden has been much more inclined to resist than respond to that pressure. A ceasefire could diffuse that pressure for a time. But even Biden may not be able to ignore the inevitable backlash among Democrats if Netanyahu, with or without a cease fire, eventually fulfills his pledge to launch a ground invasion of Rafah. The fierce Israeli response to the terrorist attacks of October 7 may leave in rubble not just much of Gaza, but the US tradition of bipartisan support for Israel.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/06/politics/biden-israel-partisan-split-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Biden\u2019s decision to go public with the ultimatum in an interview with CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett last week was greeted with pointed criticism across the GOP spectrum on Sunday, and vocal concern among Democrats. \u201cOn the one hand, they\u2019re saying too many Palestinian civilians have been killed. With the other hand, they\u2019re depriving us of the precision guided weapons that actually cut down on civilian casualties,\u201d Republican Sen. JD Vance of Ohio told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union,\u201d though Biden specifically mentioned withholding bombs and artillery shells\u00a0deemed\u00a0by the administration as indiscriminate and imprecise. \u201cSo if you\u2019re worried about Palestinian casualties, the stated policy here actually doesn\u2019t make a ton of sense,\u201d Vance said. The US is also reviewing the potential sale or transfer of other munitions, including Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) kits, to Israel. But these\u00a0transfers are not imminent and would occur in the future, a US official said. The president\u2019s announcement last week amounted to a turning point\u00a0in\u00a0US-Israeli ties\u00a0since\u00a0the seven-month conflict between Israel and Hamas\u00a0began in October.\u00a0Still,\u00a0the president\u2019s aides said the message shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise to their intended recipients in Israel given repeated warnings to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Earlier this month, Biden signed off on a pause of 3,500 bombs to Israel that administration officials feared would be dropped on Rafah \u2014 where Israel has issued evacuation orders for some of the estimated 1.4 million civilians sheltering there as it appears poised to continue its advancement on the southern Gaza city. And last week, Biden told Burnett that if Israel goes into Rafah, \u201cI\u2019m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities \u2013 that deal with that problem.\u201d Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina called the ultimatum \u201cthe worst decision in the history of the US-Israel relationship.\u201d A frequent White House critic, Graham called on the Biden administration to \u201ckeep the weapons flowing\u201d and sit down with Israel. GOP Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, meanwhile, told Fox News on Sunday that Biden\u2019s decision sends \u201ca horrible message for Israel\u201d and claimed that the president is \u201cunfortunately, now part of the pro-Hamas wing of his party.\u201d But the backlash hasn\u2019t just fallen along party lines. On Friday, a group of 26 House Democrats sent a letter to Biden saying they are \u201cdeeply concerned about the message the Administration is sending to Hamas and other Iranian-backed terrorist proxies by withholding weapons shipments to Israel.\u201d The group of House Democrats, led by Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, also requested a briefing from the White House to get more information on Biden\u2019s decision, as well as how and when aid appropriated by Congress for Israel will be delivered. Democratic Rep. Adam Smith of Washington\u00a0state,\u00a0however, highlighted the kinds of weapons being withheld.\u00a0\u201cThe\u00a0president was not as clear on this in the Erin Burnett interview as he should have been,\u201d he said Sunday on Fox News, adding: \u201cAll that has been held back to date are dumb, 2,000-pound bombs because the president feels \u2013 and I think rightly \u2013 they should not be used in Rafah.\u201d Other Democrats have offered more forceful defenses of Biden, who arrived at his ultimatum decision after multiple rounds of phone calls with Netanyahu, starting in mid-February. Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut told Bash in a separate interview on \u201cState of the Union\u201d that Biden was \u201clearning the mistakes of US military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan.\u201d \u201cWhat we learned in both of those efforts was that you cannot defeat terrorist ideology. You cannot defeat a terrorist movement,\u201d he said. The president, Murphy said, \u201cis telling Israelis we will be partners but you have to understand the pace of civilian casualties, the amount of disaster is, in the long run, going to make Hamas stronger, is going to make it more likely that Israel will be attacked again, and is going to make other terrorist organizations that have designs to attack the United States stronger.\u201d US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Sunday that the US believes Israel has killed more civilians than Hamas terrorists as part of its war in Gaza, and that Israel needs to do more to mitigate civilian deaths. \u201cWhile Israel has processes, procedures, rules, regulations to try to minimize civilian harm, given the impact that this operation, this war in Gaza has had on the civilian population, those have not been applied consistently and effectively,\u201d Blinken said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d The Ministry of Health in Gaza\u00a0reported Sunday\u00a0that the number of people killed in the enclave as a result of Israeli military operations has risen above 35,000. State Department report on Israel use of US weapons Last week, the State Department released a report saying it is \u201creasonable to assess\u201d that US weapons have been used by Israeli forces in\u00a0Gaza\u00a0in ways that are \u201cinconsistent\u201d with international humanitarian law but\u00a0stopped short of officially saying Israel violated the law. Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland told CBS\u2019 Margaret Brennan on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that \u201cI think there\u2019s enough on the books to be able to point to specific cases and make specific determinations. And on that score, the administration did duck the hard questions.\u201d Pressed if he fears the report helped give political cover to Netanyahu to continue deadly strikes in Israel, Van Hollen said he worries the administration did not provide \u201can unvarnished accounting of the facts and the law.\u201d The report did not find that Israel has withheld humanitarian aid to Gaza in violation of international law, despite conflicting reports. \u201cBy not calling that out flatly and saying that there have been arbitrary restrictions put on it [humanitarian aid], I fear that we have set a very, very low bar, a very low standard for what\u2019s acceptable,\u201d Van Hollen said. \u201cAnd I think that will come back to haunt us.\u201d Murphy said the report \u201ccould have gone further\u201d but added it does \u201caccurately explain the complexity of this. And let\u2019s just also be clear about that. Yes, I believe that there have been some very disastrous decisions on proportionality created by Israeli military.\u201d Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, defending Biden from Van Hollen\u2019s criticisms over the State Department report, said. \u201cI think President Biden has taken forceful action \u2013 so much so there\u2019s been a lot of blowback for his recent public statement.\u201d This story has been updated with additional context.

The president, who is currently traveling in San Francisco, signed the Federal Aviation Administration funding extension using the autopen \u2013 a device used for automatic signatures \u2013\u00a0in order to ensure there was no lapse in funding, a White House official said. The bill was transmitted to the White House Friday afternoon, the official said. The use of the autopen, which was first used by President Barack Obama to sign legislation, has been a rarity in the Biden administration. The White House has gone to great lengths at times to fly physical bills to  Biden while he\u2019s traveling abroad, including a $40 billion Ukraine aid package the president signed while in South Korea in 2022 and a 2022 bill to avert a government shutdown while the president was on vacation in St. Croix. The Senate also approved a bipartisan FAA reauthorization bill that renews authority for the agency for the next five years on Thursday night. The House will next need to pass that legislation. That bill would renew authority for the agency for the next five years and aims to improve aviation safety, enhance protections for passengers and airline workers and invest in airport and air travel infrastructure nationwide. The bill would authorize more than $105 billion in funding for the FAA as well as $738 million for the National Transportation Safety Board for fiscal years 2024 through 2028. Among a wide range of provisions, the legislation\u00a0seeks to address\u00a0the nation\u2019s shortage of air traffic controllers with directives aimed at expanding hiring, includes strengthened consumer protections for refunds for flight cancellations and delays, and would implement technology to reduce the risk of runway collisions. Although there is broad bipartisan support for the legislation, the package touched off contentious debate over some of its provisions. One flashpoint centered around\u00a0flights at Reagan National Airport\u00a0just outside of Washington, DC \u2013 with a group of Washington area Senate Democrats who oppose adding more longer-distance flights in and out pressing for an amendment vote to strip it out of the package.\u00a0Ultimately, however, there were no votes on amendments. Some lawmakers argue that adding flights will give consumers more choices and bring down prices, while others say it would increase congestion and delays at the airport. The House now has until next week to pass the Senate-passed, five-year reauthorization bill and send it to Biden\u2019s desk.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/politics/biden-week-faa-extension-autopen/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_politics_justice-department-ai-sentences-election-crimes", "text": "Federal prosecutors will pursue tougher sentences in cases in which artificial intelligence is used to commit an election-related crime, including threatening violence against election workers and voter suppression, Deputy US Attorney General Lisa Monaco said Monday. The Justice Department policy change is an effort to keep pace with a chaotic information environment ahead of the\u00a02024 presidential election, as AI tools have made it much easier to mimic politicians\u2019 voices and likenesses to spread false information. The new policy applies to cases in which AI makes the election-related crime \u201cmore dangerous and more impactful,\u201d Monaco said. \u201cOur democratic process and the public servants who protect it have been under attack like never before as threats evolve and spread,\u201d Monaco told a meeting of the Justice Department\u2019s Election Threats Task Force on Monday afternoon. AI and other advances in technology are \u201cemboldening those threatening election workers and the integrity of our elections,\u201d she said. The emergence in recent years of AI-driven software programs that can produce deepfakes, or fake audio or video, has complicated the threat environment for election workers and the federal and state officials trying to protect them. US officials focused on election security are concerned that AI tools will exacerbate this already-fraught threat environment, pointing to an incident during the Democratic primary in New Hampshire in January as an example. An AI-made robocall imitating President Joe Biden targeted thousands of New Hampshire voters, urging them not to vote in the primary.\u00a0A New Orleans magician made the robocall at the behest of a political consultant working for Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, a long-shot Democratic challenger to Biden, the\u00a0magician told CNN. Federal officials have also been mapping out ways in which foreign powers might try something similar to the fake Biden robocall to try to influence voters. Senior officials from the Biden administration in December\u00a0drilled\u00a0for a hypothetical scenario in which Chinese operatives\u00a0created an AI-generated video showing a Senate candidate destroying ballots. The Justice Department is already under pressure from election officials to do more to investigate the flood of harassing phone calls and emails they have received in recent years. Many of those threats have been made without AI tools and by people who falsely believe there was widespread fraud in the 2020 election. An Ohio man was sentenced in March to over two years in prison for making death threats to an Arizona election official, whom he accused of committing fraud. The danger is persistent. Thirty-eight percent of more than 900 local election officials surveyed in February and March by the nonprofit Brennan Center for Justice reported experiencing threats, harassment or abuse. More than half of the election officials surveyed expressed concern for the safety of their colleagues and staff. \u201cElection offices across the country continue to deal with threats and harassment for doing their jobs, and in many places, this behavior has been nearly nonstop since mid-2020,\u201d Amy Cohen, the executive director of the National Association of State Election Directors, told CNN. \u201cThis should be unacceptable to all Americans.\u201d Election offices have in recent years been working more closely with state and local law enforcement on personal safety training and \u201cphysical security best practices to help staff stay safe,\u201d Cohen said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/politics/justice-department-ai-sentences-election-crimes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/13/2024", "section": "politics"}}
