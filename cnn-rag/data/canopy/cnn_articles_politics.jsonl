A decisive loss at the top of the ticket could cost Democrats control of the US Senate for the remainder of this decade and cement Republican dominance of the Supreme Court for a generation. So far, Democratic anxiety about the presidential race\u2019s impact on the Senate has been muted because public polling has almost invariably shown their candidates still leading in the key states where Biden has fallen behind former President Donald Trump. But recent history raises deep questions about whether Democratic Senate candidates can continue to levitate as far above the presidential ticket as polls now show. Throughout this century, but especially over roughly the past decade, it has grown increasingly difficult for Senate candidates in either party to win in states that usually vote for the other side in presidential contests. During the 2016 and 2020 election years, Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine was the only candidate, out of 69 total Senate races, who won in a state that voted the other way at the presidential level. This year, Democrats are defending an unusually large concentration of Senate seats in states that now appear at risk for them in the presidential contest. If Democrats lose a substantial number of those seats this year, it could be very difficult for them to recapture a Senate majority before these same seats come up again in 2030. The reason is that very few of the other Senate seats Republicans now hold are in states where Democrats have a realistic chance of winning, absent a dramatic change in their political balance. In turn, extended GOP control of the Senate, coupled with a return of Trump to the White House, would give the party ample time to nominate and confirm much younger replacements for Samuel Alito (74) and Clarence Thomas (76), the two oldest and most conservative Supreme Court Justices, and possibly also Sonia Sotomayor (70), the oldest Democratic-appointed justice. \u201cBecause of the big sorting out of the states \u2026 Democrats have a narrower path to a Senate majority than Republicans do, which means this year is crucial,\u201d said former Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana. \u201cThe margin of error [for Democrats] is not high, and the consequences will be with us for another six years.\u201d If the presidential and Senate elections go badly for Democrats, Bayh added, Republicans \u201ccould change the judicial branch of government for a generation.\u201d Vulnerable Democratic Senate seats this year fall into three broad buckets. The first includes three states that Trump carried in 2016 and 2020 and that he is virtually certain to win again \u2014 likely by a substantial margin. In that group, both sides concede the GOP will win the West Virginia seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Joe Manchin, who\u2019s now an independent but still caucuses with Democrats; veteran Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jon Tester of Montana, who have survived difficult reelections even as their states have moved right, are facing substantial challenges this year. If Republicans win just two of those three states, they would still seize control of the Senate (absent offsetting Democratic wins in any GOP-held seats, which are unlikely). But if Democrats only lost some combination of the three 2020 Trump states, they would remain close enough to the GOP in the chamber to retain realistic hopes of recapturing the Senate in 2026 or 2028. The real risk to Democrats is that their losses could extend beyond that inner circle of strongly red-leaning states \u2014 particularly if the presidential race goes badly. Democrats are defending five more Senate seats this year in presidential swing states where most polls now show Biden trailing, or at best running even. That list includes Democratic Sens. Bob Casey in Pennsylvania, Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin and Jacky Rosen in Nevada, as well as Reps. Elissa Slotkin and Ruben Gallego, who are seeking open Senate seats now held by Democrats in Michigan and Arizona respectively. (Retiring Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona still caucuses with Democrats after becoming an independent.) Biden\u2019s 2020 margin of victory was three points or less in all of those states. As Biden\u2019s position has weakened since last month\u2019s CNN debate, strategists in both parties are just beginning to look at another circle of Democratic-held Senate seats in more strongly blue-leaning states where some polls have suggested an unexpectedly competitive presidential race. Topping that list are the contests in New Mexico, where Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich is facing Nella Domenici, the daughter of the late Pete Domenici, a long-time Republican senator from the state; and New Jersey, where Republicans chose a relatively centrist nominee, Curtis Bashaw, to oppose Democratic Rep. Andy Kim in a race complicated by the\u00a0possible independent candidacy\u00a0of indicted Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez. Even if the Democrats\u2019 vulnerability ultimately does not extend to that outer perimeter, significant losses for the party in the first two circles,\u00a0as I\u2019ve written, could leave them with few paths back to a Senate majority for the remainder of this decade. This year, the only Republican senators Democrats are targeting are Rick Scott in Florida and Ted Cruz in Texas, and Biden\u2019s difficulties in both states leave Democrats facing huge headwinds in those races. The list of other Republican-held Senate seats that Democrats can realistically target in the years to come, based on the states\u2019 current political leanings, is small. Republicans hold only two Senate seats in states that voted for Biden last time (Collins, who will face reelection in 2026, and Wisconsin\u2019s Ron Johnson, who isn\u2019t up until 2028 after narrowly winning another term in 2022). North Carolina is the only other state with Republican senators where Biden finished within 3 points of Trump in 2020 \u2014 and even there, Democrats have not won a presidential or Senate contest since 2008. Beyond these four seats \u2014 Maine, Wisconsin and the two in North Carolina \u2014 Democrats have no more tempting targets before 2030 among Republican-held Senate seats than Florida, Iowa and Ohio, all of which are long shots for them. Meanwhile, Democrats will have another round of their own swing state Senate seats to defend over those two elections. All of this means the seats Democrats could lose this year if the presidential ticket drags down their Senate nominees in states such as Michigan, Nevada and Arizona are virtually irreplaceable for them. \u201cA Democratic Senate majority coalition relies on having both Senators from a state such as Michigan,\u201d said Daniel Hopkins, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist. Absent a major external event, such as an economic crash while Republicans hold the White House, \u201cif the Democrats don\u2019t hold their own in the Senate this year, it is hard to see how they recover\u201d before 2030, he added. The prospect that Biden\u2019s eroding position could produce a lasting Senate deficit \u2014 which, in turn, could allow Republicans to further reshape the federal judiciary, including the Supreme Court \u2014 hasn\u2019t produced panic among Democrats yet because of the public and private polls consistently showing their Senate candidates running well ahead of the president.\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s true before the debate is true after: for voters, Senate campaigns are candidate vs. candidate battles,\u201d said David Bergstein, communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Optimistic Democrats believe the personal vulnerabilities of the GOP challengers \u2014 which include a disproportionate number of wealthy business people without much, or any, prior political experience \u2014 will allow their candidates to survive even a substantial undertow in the presidential contest. \u201cRepublicans have a roster of deeply flawed recruits, and we\u2019ll win because we have the better candidates,\u201d Bergstein said. But Republicans say the Democratic advantage in these races is only temporary. \u201cOur challengers are still building name ID, which is the reason they are lagging the Presidential ballot at this point,\u201d Mike Berg, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in an email. \u201cExpect the horse race numbers to tighten significantly as Republican candidates begin advertising more heavily. The more important number to look at right now is the ballot share the [Democratic] incumbents are receiving - which is consistently below 50 in our target states.\u201d Lee Drutman, a senior fellow in the political reform program at New America, a center-left think tank, likewise thinks \u201cit seems unlikely that you could have as big of a gap\u201d between Biden and Democratic Senate candidates as polls now show. While many of the GOP nominees are weak, Drutman said, Biden\u2019s struggles could depress Democratic turnout in a way that hurts the party up and down the ballot. \u201cIf Democrats stick with Biden after all this,\u201d Drutman predicted, \u201cI would expect Democratic voter enthusiasm to plummet.\u201d Many Democratic pollsters and operatives are also nervous about the contrast between current polling and recent history. One leading Democratic pollster, who asked for anonymity while discussing campaign strategy, told me that in several of the swing states, post-debate polls show Democratic Senate candidates clinging to small leads while Biden has fallen substantially behind Trump. \u201cI just don\u2019t know if we can hold that kind of gap,\u201d the pollster said. \u201cYou are setting up the classic dynamic where the Senate candidates have to win with people who are not voting for him [Biden].\u201d Jason Kander has experience trying to navigate those treacherous waters. In 2016, as the Democratic Senate candidate in Missouri, Kander ran over 8 percentage points ahead of presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, one of the widest gaps anywhere in the country that year. But when Clinton lost the state by almost 525,000 votes, Kander still fell short against Republican Sen. Roy Blunt. Kander said that it is impossible for any Senate candidate to completely escape the gravitational pull of the presidential contest. \u201cThe presidential race doesn\u2019t just dominate politics, it dominates popular culture during a presidential year,\u201d he told me. \u201cNearly everything is a response to that. Not just in politics, but in everything.\u201d Kander said he believes it will be easier for incumbent senators, who have longer relationships with voters, to establish an identity separate from the presidential nominee than it was for him as a challenger. But, in either circumstance, he believes the key to outrunning the presidential ticket is to convey authenticity and independence. That doesn\u2019t require, he said, breaking from the presidential ticket on high-profile policy issues: \u201cI can\u2019t even think of an issue where it would be in the political interest of a candidate to break from Biden this year, with the exception of regional issues,\u201d he said. But it does demand, he believes, that candidates show themselves to be genuinely rooted in the values and experiences of their state. Given that necessity, Kander said that it would be a mistake for the White House to demand that Democrats unwaveringly dismiss voter concerns about Biden\u2019s age. \u201cIf what happens in this election is President Biden asks down-ballot candidates to go to voters and say that they have zero concerns whatsoever and what they saw in the debate didn\u2019t bother them at all, there is a possibility that you are asking them to sacrifice some credibility in the exact same way that President Trump did in the mid-terms when he required a lot of candidates to go out and say that the election was rigged,\u201d Kander said. \u201cA lot of independent voters looked at that and said that makes me question your credibility on every other argument you are making.\u201d Bayh, who had stepped down from the Senate in 2010, also ran on that 2016 ballot with Clinton when he tried to regain an open Indiana Senate seat. Bayh ran about 5 points ahead of her, but fell to Republican Todd Young when Clinton lost Indiana by about 525,000 votes. Bayh told me that over the course of his political career, which included two elections as Indiana\u2019s governor beginning in 1988, the number of voters willing to vote for presidential candidates of one party and lower-ballot candidates of the other markedly declined, especially in congressional and Senate races. In many ways, he said, that has been a rational response from voters to the transformation of the House and Senate into quasi-parliamentary institutions with much higher levels of party-line voting than through most of the 20th\u00a0century. \u201cThe public has kind of looked at that and figured it out that it\u2019s become more parliamentary,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see a dramatic decline in split ticket voting and much more people voting red team or blue team.\u201d That shift has accelerated in recent years. As recently as the 1980s, it was common for voters to split their tickets in Senate races. After Ronald Reagan\u2019s landslide victory in 1984, for instance, Democrats still controlled about half the Senate seats in the states that voted for him both times \u2014 many of them conservative Southern states still unwilling to vote for Republicans below the presidential level. By 2012, though, Democrats held over four-fifths of the Senate seats in the states that twice voted for Barack Obama while Republicans held more than three-fourths of them in the states that twice voted against him. Still, even that alignment left room for some Senate candidates to swim against this general tide. When Obama was first elected in 2008, six Democrats won in states that voted against him, and Collins won in Maine, which voted for him. In Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection, five other Democratic Senate candidates won in states that voted against him, while Republican Dean Heller won in Nevada, which supported Obama. Since 2012, though, voters have relentlessly pruned these \u201cmismatched\u201d Senate candidates. In the 2014 and 2018 midterm elections, Democrats lost nine of the 11 Senate seats they won in states that voted against Obama during his two presidential races. And while Collins was reelected in 2014, Heller \u2014 the only other GOP senator elected in a state that voted Democratic during Obama\u2019s two races \u2014 was defeated in 2018. In the presidential election years, the pull of the presidential outcome on Senate results has become even more profound. In 2016, for the first time since the direct election of senators, all 34 Senate races went the same way as the presidential result in that state; in 2020, when 35 Senate contests (including two special elections) were held, only Collins defied the presidential outcome. The 2020 results demonstrated the strength of this current most powerfully in the failed Democratic attempt to capture six GOP-held Senate seats in Republican leaning states. Democratic Senate challengers that year in Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Montana, South Carolina, and Texas spent a combined $382 million on their campaigns, a remarkable sum. And yet when Biden lost those states, so did all six Democratic challengers. Despite the huge sums the six raised and spent, Montana\u2019s outgoing Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock was the only one among them who ran more than 2.1 percentage points ahead of Biden in their state. In those races, Republicans recognized they could win even if the Democratic candidates outspent them or maintained relatively favorable personal images, said Republican consultant Jesse Hunt, who served as the NRSC\u2019s communications director in 2020. \u201cAs long as everything was kept close, we knew the sheer atmospherics\u201d of the presidential race would tip the result, he said. \u201cMoney, personal popularity, image and name identification don\u2019t actually matter if the margin at the top of the ticket is overwhelming.\u201d Like other Republicans, Hunt believes that these historic trends in Senate races mean that the Democrats now clinging to their leads as Biden slips \u201care all at risk.\u201d\u00a0Several Democratic sources told me the party senators on the ballot this year are acutely aware that just one of the 69 Senate races in 2016 and 2020 favored the party that lost the presidential race in that state. This history, by itself, doesn\u2019t answer whether Democratic Senate candidates would have better prospects with or without Biden as their presidential nominee. But it does tell them that the consequences of the party\u2019s choice on whether to stick with Biden are certain to reverberate beyond the White House. \u201cDemocrats certainly cannot rely on the idea that Senate races will be decoupled from the presidential race,\u201d said Hopkins, the political scientist, \u201cbecause they won\u2019t.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/politics/senate-races-biden-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}

How strong of a guarantee to provide to Ukraine about its future membership to NATO has been a key source of debate between the 32 members of the alliance ahead of this week\u2019s summit in Washington, CNN previously reported. The draft could change before the final version, but the presence of the \u201cirreversible\u201d language would be a significant signal to Kyiv and Moscow as the war in Ukraine continues with little sign of an end. One of the sources, a US official, said the White House supports the use of the word in the final communique as long as the document also reaffirms that Ukraine\u2019s work on democratic reforms must continue. The official said the final version is expected to contain that language. While many Europeans have emphasized the need for strong language around Ukraine\u2019s eventual future in the alliance, US and German officials had proposed describing a \u201cbridge\u201d to NATO membership for Ukraine. However, officials have also stressed the importance of \u201ctangible measures,\u201d in the words of a European diplomat, to support Kyiv\u2019s ongoing fight against Russia. Ruslan Stefanchuk, the chair of Ukraine\u2019s parliament, said at an event Monday that it\u2019s not just about language, but it\u2019s about actually bringing Ukraine closer to NATO. A US senior administration official said Friday that the alliance will make \u201csignificant new announcements about how we\u2019re increasing NATO\u2019s military, political and financial support for Ukraine\u201d as part of Kyiv\u2019s \u201cbridge to NATO.\u201d US officials on Monday publicly declined to discuss specifics of the joint communique ahead of the summit, which kicks off on Tuesday. \u201cThere is rightly considerable focus on what Allies will say about Ukraine\u2019s membership path in the summit declaration. The language will be clear and forceful. It will recognize Ukraine\u2019s vital ongoing reform efforts and demonstrate Allied support for Ukraine on its path to NATO membership,\u201d Michael Carpenter, the senior advisor for Europe at the National Security Council, said at a briefing Monday. The senior administration official said Friday that what they \u201cdescribed in terms of the bridge to membership and the deliverables that NATO will be unveiling for Ukraine is quite substantial.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about some sort of plan for how they\u2019re going to get from here to there. We\u2019re talking about standing up an entire command at Wiesbaden, and we\u2019ll look at how we do these various pieces that I mentioned earlier \u2013 training, coordination, equipping, coordination, logistics, force development. This is a very serious effort to get Ukraine in a position, as I said earlier, where it will be ready to assume its roles and responsibilities within the alliance on day one,\u201d the official said. \u201cI\u2019ll let the Ukrainians speak for themselves, but I think they understand the value of what NATO will be doing for that,\u201d they said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/politics/draft-nato-communique-ukraine/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}

But it has continued to seek to extract costs from the US and Israel. The conflict in Gaza has sparked protests across the United States,\u00a0in particular on college campuses, where some Americans have expressed horror at the scale of civilian casualties caused by Israel as it attempts to stamp out Hamas, which carried out the October 7 attack on southern Israel.

The inspector general\u2019s office released its report Tuesday, concluding that shooting incident policies should be updated to address crime scene management and situations when the Justice Department is working with a state or local law enforcement partner. The report stems from the fatal shooting of LaVoy Finicum, killed by Oregon State Police during a standoff at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge where protesters were objecting to federal land policies. Though Finicum was killed by state police, who were cleared of wrongdoing, investigators later found that two FBI agents also shot at Finicum during the incident. The agents were interviewed several times in the days after the shooting and never disclosed that they fired shots. One of them was later tried for lying to investigators and acquitted by a federal jury. Since the fatal shot was from an Oregon State Police officer, state and local law enforcement personnel \u2014 not the FBI \u2014 assumed control of the scene from the outset and conducted the shooting investigation, according to the inspector general. But aerial surveillance video taken by an FBI plane shortly after the shooting showed FBI personnel \u201cmoving around the scene in the dark, using flashlights to look under and around vehicles, examining the area near the roadblock, and appearing to pick up objects from the roadway,\u201d according to the IG report. FBI personnel are authorized to remove things from the crime scene once it is secure and if there has not been a critical incident, such as an FBI agent-involved shooting, the report said. In recommending policy updates, the inspector general noted the FBI\u2019s crime scene management procedures only explicitly applied to shootings being investigated by the bureau, and not when state or local law enforcement lead an investigation where no FBI agent is believed at the time of the shooting to have fired their weapon.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/politics/doj-watchdog-report-oregon-2016/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_politics_biden-nato-analysis", "text": "The NATO summit was long planned to celebrate the alliance\u2019s 75th anniversary, to lock in longterm military support for Ukraine and even to future-proof the West against a possible second term for Donald Trump. But no one expected the meeting in Washington this week to turn into a public test of 81-year-old President Joe Biden\u2019s health and cognitive capacity with his reelection campaign facing an existential moment after his disastrous debate performance. Biden\u2019s leadership of NATO and lifeline to Ukraine following Russia\u2019s invasion make him the most significant presidential trustee of the alliance since President George H.W. Bush. But his achievements, including Sweden and Finland\u2019s entry into the group, will be eclipsed at the summit by his battle to save his political future. Every step Biden takes, every gesture he makes, and every word he utters will be under intense scrutiny, especially in unscripted moments after the image of an aged and at times incoherent commander in chief was burned into the minds of 50 million viewers at the CNN debate in Atlanta late last month. A president who is older than the alliance itself will be under enormous pressure to show vigor and mental clarity at a solo news conference on Thursday. Any hint of confusion or weakness could spark a fresh round of panic among Democrats and derail Biden\u2019s aggressive effort to quell talk of him abandoning his campaign. The president can expect a volley of questions about his health, his medical records and whether he has been hiding the true details of his condition from journalists infuriated by the White House\u2019s handling of the debate fallout. The press conference will also be a must-see event for Democrats who are demanding he do far more to prove he is fit to serve a second term that would end when he is 86. Sen. Patty Murray, for instance, warned Monday evening, \u201cWe need to see a much more forceful and energetic candidate on the campaign trail in the very near future in order for him to convince voters he is up to the job.\u201d It was a strikingly strong statement by the Washington state Democrat that underscored the vulnerability of Biden\u2019s position. She added: \u201cAt this critical time for our country, President Biden must seriously consider the best way to preserve his incredible legacy and secure it for the future.\u201d Biden will also have an important audience overseas. The effects of the president\u2019s advancing age are not just an issue for his political future; they are now the West\u2019s problem given that he is the last defense against a stunning comeback by Trump, who spent his first term berating NATO allies and cozying up to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump has suggested he would let Moscow \u201cdo whatever the hell they want\u201d and would not honor NATO\u2019s sacred Article 5 mutual defense principle if he considered that a member state had not met the alliance\u2019s defense spending guidelines. World leaders will be keen to make their own assessment of Biden Biden\u2019s debacle created a new complication for US allies already formulating plans for a possibility that many of them dread \u2014 a Trump victory in November. The world leaders who will spend hours with Biden this week are therefore certain to make their own assessments of the president and his political hopes. Kurt Volker, a former US ambassador to NATO, said Biden\u2019s partners will arrive in Washington looking for both political and strategic assurances about Biden and the United States\u2019 future role as the leader of NATO. \u201cIs it going to be President Biden? Is he capable of that? Is he going to run for reelection, is he going to get reelected? If so, what does that look like?\u201d Volker told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on Monday. Allies are also looking toward an uncertain future, Volker said. \u201cThen they worry \u2013 if he doesn\u2019t do that and it\u2019s former president Donald Trump coming back, what does that mean for US support for NATO, US support for Ukraine?\u201d Foreign diplomats and governments are loath to speak about Biden\u2019s plight on the record out of a desire to avoid being dragged into domestic US politics. But diplomats from Europe, Asia and the Middle East expressed disbelief at his debate showing, CNN reported last week. And looking forward to the summit, one European diplomat said leaders from the continent would stay polite and seek to avoid any accusations of interference or taking sides in US politics. But the person added: \u201cBeneath this cool surface, I believe (the) Biden debate is very crucial. \u2026 I don\u2019t believe there are many Europeans who could see how Biden could still be a successful candidate.\u201d Another European diplomat said that \u201cevery leader arriving in Washington in the coming days will ask questions about (Biden\u2019s position) and there will be lot of speculation, but the NATO echo chamber doesn\u2019t change the US domestic political calculus in any way.\u201d The furor over Biden\u2019s age is just the latest shock to rattle the certainty that NATO partners placed in the United States as the alliance\u2019s senior member for more than 60 years \u2013 through and after the Cold War until Trump\u2019s arrival in the White House. America\u2019s political paroxysms have left many allies, especially in Europe, considering how to protect themselves in an age when Washington is just as likely to be an agent of volatility as stability. Some question whether the US will be there to defend them anymore. \u201cIt\u2019s a reality that we have to be prepared for the unpredictability of the US ally,\u201d a European official said. US officials reject any suggestion of concern among Biden\u2019s partners about his capacity to lead the alliance, even as multiple polls show most Americans believe he is too old to serve a second term. \u201cForeign leaders have seen Joe Biden up close and personal for the last three years. They know who they are dealing with and how effective he\u2019s been,\u201d a senior administration official said on condition of anonymity. The administration\u2019s national security spokesman John Kirby on Monday denied that foreign leaders needed to be assured about Biden\u2019s capacities. \u201cWe\u2019re not picking up any signs of that from our allies at all. Quite the contrary,\u201d he said. The critical national security substance of the summit is unlikely to be adversely affected by Biden\u2019s political crisis since diplomats and top military brass have been thrashing out deliverables for months. They\u2019ve focused on institutionalizing aid to Ukraine and on the future relationship between the alliance and the Kyiv government and its desire to eventually join the alliance. After months of diplomatic haggling, a draft text of the final summit communique describes Ukraine as having an \u201cirreversible\u201d path to membership, three sources familiar with the deliberations told CNN. Biden\u2019s political storm shows no sign of abating These are surreal days in Washington, with a sitting president waging a battle to remain atop his party\u2019s ticket less than four months from Election Day. On Monday, the president insisted he wasn\u2019t going anywhere even as worried Democratic lawmakers discussed whether Biden would cost his party the House and the Senate as well as the presidency if he remains their presidential candidate. Rep. Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, joined lawmakers calling for Biden to fold his reelection bid. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a good message. The president has shown he is not capable of delivering that message in an effective way,\u201d the Washington state Democrat told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Monday. After days of conflicting statements about the president\u2019s medical situation, the White House, meanwhile, insisted that it was \u201cnot warranted\u201d for the president to have a new cognitive test and didn\u2019t fully explain why a physician who specializes in Parkinson\u2019s disease had held a meeting with the president\u2019s doctor earlier this year. Biden had earlier called into MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d to underscore his refusal to cede his campaign in a manner that indicated that any subsequent request from Democratic leaders for him to leave the ticket would cause an ugly political spectacle. Biden also seized on the upcoming summit as proof of his leadership skills and success as president, while his campaign sought to use his turn on the global stage on US soil to reset the comparison between him and Trump \u2014 the core theme of his campaign, which has been obliterated by his dismal night at the debate. \u201cThe rest of the world is looking \u2014 our allies are looking for US leadership. Who else \u2014 who else do you think could step in here and do this?\u201d Biden said on MSNBC. In an interview with ABC News on Friday, the president also billed himself as essential to global security. \u201cI\u2019m the guy that put NATO together, the future. No one thought I could expand it. I\u2019m the guy that shut Putin down. No one thought could happen,\u201d Biden said. The president has not shut Putin down \u2014 the brutal Russian daylight air attack on Kyiv that hit a children\u2019s hospital on Monday is proof of that. But he has mustered the most effective arming of a Russian adversary since the US backed the Afghan mujahideen fighting the Soviet Union in the 1980s and has indeed reinvigorated NATO and presided over the two Nordic nations entering the alliance. On the eve of the summit, Biden\u2019s campaign distributed a memo lauding his leadership in keeping Kyiv standing more than two years after the Russian invasion. \u201cDonald Trump is a threat to NATO, a gift to Putin and a wrecking ball to global peace, democracy and human rights,\u201d the memo read. The campaign also pointed out the presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s frequent genuflecting toward Putin. \u201cThe eyes of the world will be on the NATO summit this week, where Joe Biden has strengthened, expanded and led the NATO Alliance against Putin\u2019s violation of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and unwarranted aggression.\u201d It will not be much comfort to Biden, but he is not the only NATO leader who is politically weakened. French President Emmanuel Macron will arrive in Washington after triggering a new era of political instability. His ordering of snap legislative elections to thwart the rise of the extreme right party of Marine Le Pen failed to produce a governing majority and empowered the far-left. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is weakened after his party and coalition took a beating in European Parliament elections. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing intense speculation about his future ahead of next year\u2019s general election after his Liberal Party lost an election in a Toronto district it had held for decades. The thorny question of Biden\u2019s age will also be underscored in summit photos since many of the leaders are far younger than a president born during World War II whose foreign policy expertise is honed from a half century of political experience spanning the Cold War and the increasingly restive period ever since. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is 47, for example. And Macron is 46. Trudeau has been in power for nearly a decade but is still only 52. The summit will also mark the international debut of new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, 61, who was elected last Thursday. Biden has been a steadfast guide for NATO ever since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and has made the survival of global democracy the cornerstone of his presidency. But he has a far more urgent priority at the summit this week \u2013 saving himself.

{"id": "2024_07_09_politics_hunter-biden-gun-trial", "text": "Hunter Biden has withdrawn a\u00a0request for a new gun trial, according to court filings. President Joe Biden\u2019s son is still pursuing several other challenges to his felony gun convictions, and is expected to expand those efforts soon by asking an appeals court to throw out the guilty verdicts. His lawyers told a judge Tuesday that they were withdrawing their recent request. They previously claimed there was a procedural mishap regarding one of his pretrial appeals that should\u2019ve prevented the trial from commencing \u2013 but they conceded Tuesday that they apparently misunderstood the situation. Their now-withdrawn motion for a new trial claimed District Judge Maryellen Noreika\u00a0didn\u2019t have jurisdiction\u00a0to hold the gun trial because of a technical hiccup that \u2013 in their view \u2013 meant the appeals court, and not Noreika, still had jurisdiction over the case. But they conceded Tuesday that the appeals court did, in fact, return jurisdiction to Noreika when it rejected one of his many pretrial appeals. They accepted an explanation offered in court filings Monday from special counsel David Weiss, who pointed out that the pretrial paperwork from the appeals court explicitly returned the \u201cmandate\u201d of jurisdiction back to Noreika. \u201cThe defendant\u2019s motion is meritless and is based on his apparent misunderstanding of appellate practice and his failure to read the Third Circuit\u2019s Orders,\u201d prosecutors wrote Monday. Weiss prosecuted the gun case and has also indicted Biden on tax charges in California. A trial in that case is scheduled to begin in September. The decision by Biden\u2019s team to withdraw the motion Tuesday is the latest development in a clumsy attempt to seek a new gun trial. His team initially filed this request on June 17, only to remove it from the docket within an hour. They re-filed the request on June 24, making the same arguments, but withdrew that request Tuesday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/politics/hunter-biden-gun-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "kfile-ed-martin-rnc-platform-committee-anti-abortion-exceptions", "text": "One of the leaders of the Republican National Convention\u2019s platform committee, which shapes the party\u2019s official stance on key issues, has a history of pushing extreme anti-abortion positions, including advocating for a national ban without exceptions for rape or incest. He also entertained the possibility of jailing women who get abortions and the doctors who perform them. Ed Martin, the deputy policy director for the convention\u2019s platform committee, is one of three people the Republican National Committee selected in May to help craft the party\u2019s platform, which serves as a blueprint for the Republican Party\u2019s agenda by detailing policy positions and how Republicans and former President Donald Trump would govern if elected. The platform is expected to be pared down this year, slashing the length of the document to focus on Trump\u2019s agenda for a second term. Martin has consistently espoused a hardline position on abortion, criticizing Republicans with a more moderate stance on the issue, and has even questioned the safety of birth control. \u201cThe true bane of the pro-life movement is the faction of fake pro-lifers who claim to believe in the sanctity of human life but are only willing to vote that way with a list of exceptions,\u201d Martin said on his radio show in June 2022 \u2013 several days after Roe v. Wade was struck down. Martin, an attorney and former chair of the Missouri Republican Party, was a staunch advocate for Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election and conspiracy theories the election was rigged against him. He is also the president of Phyllis Schlafly\u2019s Eagles \u2013 a socially conservative advocacy group named for the late activist best known for her opposition to feminism. Schlafly and Martin also co-authored the 2016 book, \u201cThe Conservative Case for Trump.\u201d CNN\u2019s KFile reviewed dozens of episodes of Martin\u2019s radio show, \u201cThe Pro America Report,\u201d from 2022 to 2024, to evaluate his anti-abortion comments. Particularly noteworthy from Martin\u2019s show, which airs on the streaming service Rumble, are his comments around the June 2022 Supreme Court ruling striking down Roe v Wade. \u201cIf the conversation is, \u2018Well, should there be a federal ban?\u2019 And the consensus is that there shouldn\u2019t \u2013 I disagree. I disagree with the consensus. I would like to see US Senators and US congressmen and women elected to office who would say, \u2018Let\u2019s ban abortion,\u2019\u201d he said in April 2024. Those views contrast with recent efforts by Trump to move away from calls for a national ban and his suggestions that the issue of abortion should be left to the states\u2014drawing the ire of anti-abortion groups. Trump has repeatedly advocated for exceptions in the case of rape, incest and health of the mother, including at Thursday\u2019s debate. \u201cYou have to follow your heart, but you have to get elected also,\u201d Trump said during the debate. Trump also said that he \u201cwill not block\u201d abortion medication if elected president. In an email to CNN, Daniella Alvarez, a spokeswoman for the RNC told CNN, \u201cThe Platform Committee has yet to convene to discuss what language should be in the final document.\u201d Martin did not respond to requests for comment. Abortion has emerged as a significant liability for Republicans. Voters have affirmed abortion rights in every state referendum since 2022 and GOP candidates across the country have softened their positions. Despite this, Martin has continued to advocate for some of the most extreme restrictions on abortion, discounting the case involving the rape of a 10-year-old girl from Ohio as a reason for exceptions, and even falsely claiming that abortions are never performed to save the life of a mother. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me to stop talking about abortion,\u201d Martin said in April 2024 on his radio show. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that because you don\u2019t think it\u2019s a winner politically, I\u2019m supposed to stop talking about abortion.\u201d During a June 2024 appearance on Trump ally Roger Stone\u2019s podcast, Martin said he\u2019s heavily involved in \u201cevery aspect\u201d of discussions around the platform, and reiterated his stance on abortion, pushing back on a report the Trump\u2019s campaign was attempting to soften the platform\u2019s position on abortion. \u201cThe platform will respect life in every moment,\u201d Martin told Stone. Punishing women and abortion doctors In May 2022, in the days after a draft opinion striking down Roe v. Wade was leaked, Martin discussed on his radio show possible prison sentences for women and abortion doctors. Martin said if anti-abortion activists accepted abortion rights advocates\u2019 framing \u2013 that it was about a woman\u2019s right \u2013 women could not be imprisoned for getting an abortion. But if the argument was reframed as being about a baby, the question whether to punish women was open. \u201cThe late Phyllis Schlafly, whom I worked so closely with, used to say, \u2018If you get to claim and frame the argument, you almost certainly get to win.\u2019 In other words, if you take their framing, it\u2019s a woman\u2019s right. Are you gonna put women in jail? No. It\u2019s about a baby. Now, what do we do? Frame the argument. Own the argument,\u201d he said. Earlier, Martin was discussing Louisiana\u2019s trigger law, which immediately banned abortion in almost all cases in the state after Roe was struck down. \u201cIf you ban abortion in Louisiana, is a doctor who has an abortion breaking the law? Yes. Should he be punished? Yes \u2013 I think that seems obvious. What is the punishment? Not sure yet. Could be criminal, could be a jail sentence, I suppose,\u201d he said. Martin also compared abortion to a family starving a child to death purposely in saying the state had an interest in some form of punishment. \u201cWhat do you do with the woman that has an abortion? I don\u2019t think we have a good answer yet. Some people say that they shouldn\u2019t be held liable in any way,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people say they should have some kind of penalty, something on their record,\u201d he said. \u201cI certainly think that you\u2019re gonna find a lot of people that step away from jail time. But if you believe it\u2019s a baby \u2013 I do \u2013 then you have to do something to protect the baby.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t just turn your back and say, \u2018Oh, well, you know what? In that family over there, I, I don\u2019t care what they do to their family, that\u2019s their family,\u2019\u201d he continued. \u201c\u2019I don\u2019t care if they take their five-year-old kid, and they, and they, let \u2018em starve to death.\u2019 No, you don\u2019t do that. You say, \u2018We have to have some laws that hold us together, and we have to be careful about it\u2019\u2026But we certainly would say in the case of starvation or life and death, there is an interest in the state to say, \u2018Hey, what are we gonna do here?\u2019\u201d Martin has said repeatedly he opposes abortion in any situation, including, as he said in July 2022, the rape of a 10-year-old Ohio girl. \u201cThis 10-year-old was brought up as an example of why abortion is necessary,\u201d Martin said. \u201cI have said over and over again the examples that shouldn\u2019t be the rule, right? You can\u2019t let the exceptions be the rule. Especially when you get engaged in debate. I refuse to do it. I refuse.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll just tell you, I think abortion\u2019s wrong. I think it\u2019s wrong because of morality. I think it\u2019s wrong because of science,\u201d he added. Opposition to abortion pills Martin has also said he opposes language in abortion bans that allows for abortion to save the life of a mother, falsely saying on his radio show in June 2022, \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute scientific fact that no abortion is ever performed to save the life of the mother. None, zero, zilch.\u201d The Supreme Court ruled last week that emergency abortions could be performed in Idaho in cases where the life of a pregnant woman is at stake, though the decision provides little clarity on the threshold for life-saving exceptions. Martin also falsely claimed multiple times that medically-induced abortion, which he referred to as a chemical abortion, and birth control pills were dangerous and \u201cdamaging,\u201d repeatedly\u00a0 criticizing the \u201cloosey goosey regulation around pill abortion\u201d and that it could be ordered via mail. Data analyzed by CNN last year found that the abortion pill mifepristone is safe \u2013 even safer than the drugs penicillin and Viagra \u2013 and a safer option than a procedural abortion or childbirth. The Supreme Court rejected a challenge to how the Food and Drug Administration regulates the abortion pill mifepristone in mid-June, allowing the pill to stay on the market and ship to patients without an in-person doctor\u2019s visit. RNC platform Martin is one of three leaders now shaping the GOP platform \u2013 along with Russ Vought, the influential former White House Office of Management and Budget director in the Trump administration, and Randy Evans, a former US ambassador to Luxembourg during the Trump administration. The RNC\u2019s platform typically details the party\u2019s stance on important topics such as abortion, marriage, policing, the Federal Reserve, technology, and energy. It is created by a committee that includes one male and one female representative from each US state and territory, who vote to adopt the platform at the convention. The party\u2019s platform is typically debated and fought over behind-the-scenes by party leaders. In 2016, the platform notably weakened its position on providing aid and weapons to Ukraine amidst Russian incursion, prompting the special counsel Robert Mueller one year later to investigate whether Trump himself had influenced the decision. The Mueller report found no evidence that Trump ordered or was even aware of the platform changes. In 2020, the RNC chose not to adopt a new platform because of logistics and the coronavirus pandemic.", "source": "http://cnn.com/kfile-ed-martin-rnc-platform-committee-anti-abortion-exceptions/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_politics_biden-fate-political-career", "text": "The high-stakes week ahead is critical to whether President Joe Biden\u2019s defiance will save his reelection bid or whether Democrats who question his capacity to serve a second term will succeed in pressuring him to step aside. While only a handful of House Democrats have\u00a0publicly called for the president to end his campaign, there is deep disquiet inside the party at the possibility that Biden, who swept\u00a0Donald Trump out of the White House four years ago, could ruin his legacy\u00a0and throw the country into uncharted political territory by\u00a0failing to deter voters from sending\u00a0his rival back in the Oval Office after November\u2019s election. Biden on Monday emphatically said he was staying in the race. \u201cThe question of how to move forward has been well-aired for over a week now. And it\u2019s time for it to end. We have one job. And that is to beat Donald Trump. We have 42 days to the Democratic Convention and 119 days to the general election. Any weakening of resolve or lack of clarity about the task ahead only helps Trump and hurts us,\u201d Biden wrote in a letter to congressional Democrats. \u201cIt is time to come together, move forward as a unified party, and defeat Donald Trump.\u201d Democratic anxiety reverberated through a call that House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries hosted for his conference Sunday afternoon. Some members said Biden should go, and there\u2019s a consensus among dozens of party lawmakers that he needs to step aside, sources told CNN. But a meeting that Sen. Mark Warner planned for Monday to consider the president\u2019s future is now scrapped, and the Virginia Democrat has not decided whether he thinks Biden should step aside, a source said. Several key party heavyweights said on Sunday morning news shows that the president needs to do far more to ease skepticism among voters. \u201cI think this week is going to be really critical for him to answer those remaining questions,\u201d Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d The president nevertheless insisted in a campaign swing through battleground Pennsylvania on Sunday that \u201cI\u2019m up for the job!\u201d Biden reinforced his refusal to cede the Democratic nomination he earned through a largely unopposed primary run in a high-stakes interview with ABC News on Friday, warning only the \u201cLord Almighty\u201d could compel him to end his campaign. But the interview only reinforced Democrats\u2019 panic that followed his devastating debate performance last month over his chances of beating Republican presumptive nominee Trump. The interview also raised further questions over Biden\u2019s health as he seeks a new term that would end when he is 86 and over whether he understands the gravity of his political plight as he trails Trump in polls. The turmoil surrounding Biden\u2019s future is creating a grim mood inside the White House, CNN\u2019s MJ Lee reported. West Wing staffers are rattled by the president\u2019s debate performance and the coverage of the president\u2019s subsequent struggles, although support for his reelection bid remains strong in the building. A moment of soul-searching for the Democratic Party Among the key questions now is whether a critical mass of lawmakers will unite to try to convince the president to stand aside. \u2022 If that happens, would senior party leaders be willing to go to the\u00a0president\u00a0and argue that his position is unsustainable?\u2022 And even if they did, would Biden \u2013 who has earned the votes of millions of Democrats to secure the nomination and who maintains he is fully fit to serve a new term\u00a0\u2013\u00a0agree to cede his campaign?\u2022 If the president remained obdurate at this point, Democrats would face a decision on whether to go public about their views, and many in critical states and districts would have to consider distancing themselves from their own party\u2019s presidential nominee to try to save themselves in November. There is an almost surreal quality to the frenzied political debate as Biden digs in. It would be an extraordinary twist to an already remarkable year in which Republicans will nominate a convicted felon and\u00a0twice-impeached former president if Democrats decline at the last minute to nominate a sitting president, who most believe has had a successful term,\u00a0over concerns that he can\u2019t win. Passing on Biden would also\u00a0mark\u00a0a humiliating coda to a political career that has spanned half a century, and the president would likely regard himself as the victim of scathing betrayal. If Democrats do push him aside, they\u2019d create a high-risk scenario unprecedented in modern history. They\u2019d have to decide whether to rally around Vice President Kamala Harris \u2013 which has already begun in some quarters \u2013 or whether to stage a lightning process to pick an unvetted neophyte new nominee. There would be no guarantee that a new standard-bearer would do better than Biden, who has already beaten Trump once. But the fact many want to try shows the intensity of alarm in the party and the potency of the image of an aged and sometimes incoherent president blazed on the minds of 50 million television viewers at the CNN debate in Atlanta. In a worrying sign for Biden, even senior party figures who are normally supportive and laud the achievements of his term argue that he must do far more to convince voters that he is up to the demands of the presidency. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the president\u2019s performance at the debate has raised questions for voters, not questions about his character or his decency or who he cares about or who he fights for, but questions as to whether this is still the old Joe Biden,\u201d Murphy said on\u00a0CNN\u2019s\u00a0\u201cState of the Union.\u201d He told Dana Bash that the president needed to get out and \u201cdo a town hall, that he do a press conference,\u00a0(to) show the country that he is still the old Joe Biden.\u201d Rep. Adam\u00a0Schiff also raised concerns. Like Murphy, Schiff poured praise on Biden\u2019s achievements and lacerated Trump. But he said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that the debate performance raised concerns among voters about whether Biden had the capacity to win \u201can existential race.\u201d Given that Trump is a convicted criminal, the California Democrat said that the election shouldn\u2019t be close and that the president\u2019s age is the only reason it is. \u201cHe should seek out people with some distance and objectivity. He should seek pollsters who are not his own pollsters. He should take a moment to make the best-informed judgment. And if the judgment is run, then run hard and beat that SOB.\u201d The comments of the two senior Democrats underscore the disconnect in the party. While there is alarm among many on Capitol Hill and a desire for the president to do far more in unscripted situations to prove his fitness, Biden himself has already ruled out ending his reelection bid. He refused to answer a question in the ABC News interview about what he would do if leaders such as Jeffries and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told him that he could harm Democrats in Congress if he stayed in the race. \u201cI\u2019m not going to answer that question. It\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Biden said. But the president is getting strong support from his allies in the Congressional Black Caucus.\u00a0Ohio\u00a0Rep. Joyce\u00a0Beatty, a former chair of the CBC, said Democrats \u201cshouldn\u2019t be going rogue against our own president.\u201d And voters at the Essence Festival in New Orleans voiced confidence in Biden and resisted calls for him to end his campaign, CNN\u2019s Ebony Davis and Eva McKend reported. The\u00a0ABC News interview aside, the president is not throwing himself into the intense scrutiny of repeated and spontaneous political events that even many of his supporters want to see. On Sunday, the president gave a speech in a Black church in Philadelphia and addressed campaign workers in a short, off-the-cuff speech in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. He did spend considerable time working a rope line in stifling heat. And later this week, he\u2019s expected to hold a news conference at the NATO summit he\u2019s hosting in Washington, which will be another critical barometer of his faculties. But many Democrats want him to do more amid fears that his position is so precarious that he will not only lose the White House but that he could also drag down his party, allowing Republicans to win back the House and retain the Senate. With the Supreme Court cementing an era of ultra-conservative jurisprudence, many Democrats are openly scared of the consequences of a second, unrestrained Trump presidency. House Democrats on Sunday vented their frustration about Biden\u2019s troubles and the impact they could have on winning back the House, a possibility that many members had been optimistic about until the debate. \u201cIt was pretty brutal,\u201d a senior Democratic aide told CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the private conversation among House leaders. No decisions about demands for a White House meeting or about the possibility of sending a letter to Biden are expected to be made before the full Democratic caucus meets Tuesday, aides said. A source who was on the Sunday call told CNN\u2019s MJ Lee that Jeffries has not taken a position on what should happen. But the Tuesday meeting looms as a fateful moment for the president. Concern about Biden\u2019s ability to perform on the campaign trail and the long-term implications of the debate remain deep, despite the legacy of a first term in which his legislative record matches or surpasses that of any Democratic president since Lyndon Johnson. Rep. Gerry Connolly, for instance, told CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown on Saturday that he believed what happened was more than \u201ca bad night, and that\u2019s why that image is so indelible on so many minds.\u201d The Virginia Democrat said that while Biden\u2019s performance in the ABC News interview was largely good, there were some troubling aspects. \u201cInvoking God Almighty as the only intervention that is going to dissuade him from going forward, I hope Joe Biden didn\u2019t really mean that,\u201d Connolly said. Biden hits the trail Biden sought to squash speculation about his future by seeking to project a picture of vigor on the campaign trail in Pennsylvania, a state that he must keep in his column in November to keep his hopes of victory alive. The president reflected on faith and the trials it can help surmount at a stop at Philadelphia\u2019s Mount Airy Church of God in Christ. \u201cWe\u2019re all imperfect beings. We don\u2019t know where or what faith will deliver us to or when,\u201d he said, while appearing to read from prepared notes. Black Democratic voters helped to rescue Biden\u2019s primary campaign in 2020 and to put him in the White House. He has been beset by polls in this cycle suggesting Trump is making inroads in a community that usually votes overwhelming for Democratic presidential candidates. Later in the day, Biden moved on to the state capital of Harrisburg, in the company of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a\u00a0Democratic\u00a0rising star\u00a0spoken of as a possible alternative nominee. Biden also traveled with Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, one of the most vehement supporters of his continued reelection campaign, and his old friend Sen. Bob Casey, who is in a tough reelection race, completed the impression of the commonwealth\u2019s top Democrats protecting his back. \u201cThis election is going to be about blocking, tackling simple, basic politics, simple. It\u2019s going to be a matter of how many signs we get out, how many doors we knock on, how many calls we make and how many requests we answer,\u201d Biden told supporters. His campaign has already announced that he plans to campaign in another vital swing state, Michigan, on Friday, following\u00a0this week\u2019s NATO summit in Washington. Hosting world leaders will allow Biden to highlight his credentials as a statesman and one of the most significant aspects of his term \u2014 his reinvigoration and expansion of the Western alliance and the steeling of US allies to meet the threat posed by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. If he can successfully navigate the event without more controversy, the focus may begin to turn away from his perceived liabilities and back toward Trump, who is expected to unveil his vice presidential nominee at or ahead of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee next week. By the time Biden is back in the spotlight, there will be even less time ahead of the Democratic National Convention in August for his critics to push any alternative nominee.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/politics/biden-fate-political-career/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_politics_republican-platform-trump-abortion", "text": "The panel charged with crafting and producing a platform for the Republican National Committee has adopted a scaled-back document that softened language on abortion and same-sex marriage, Donald Trump\u2019s campaign announced Monday. In addition to editing some of the language, the former president wrote some portions of the party platform himself, a source with knowledge of the matter told CNN. The new platform, which was quickly approved Monday by the RNC platform committee, reflects Trump\u2019s broader policy agenda on a range of issues as the presumptive Republican nominee continues to reshape the party in his third run for the White House. \u201cOurs is a forward-looking Agenda with strong promises that we will accomplish very quickly when we win the White House and Republican Majorities in the House and Senate,\u201d Trump\u00a0said in a social media post Monday, praising the new platform. On abortion, the updated language mirrors Trump\u2019s position in the aftermath of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision overturning Roe v. Wade that restrictions should now be left to the states. \u201cWe believe that the 14th\u00a0Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied Life or Liberty without Due Process, and the States are, therefore, free to pass Laws protecting those Rights,\u201d a draft document obtained by CNN reads. The new platform does not mention a national abortion ban, a policy some social conservatives wanted to see included, but which the former president has publicly said he opposes. After the platform was released, a leading anti-abortion group, SBA Pro-Life America, issued a statement saying that the platform reaffirms the party\u2019s \u201ccommitment to protect life through the 14th Amendment.\u201d The updated platform, which is called \u201cAmerica First: A Return to Common Sense,\u201d also no longer defines marriage as between \u201cone man and one woman.\u201d And instead of putting an emphasis on reducing the national debt, the platform calls to \u201cend inflation\u201d and \u201cMake America Affordable Again.\u201d The document also outlines Trump\u2019s stance on Social Security and Medicare, affirming the former president\u2019s stance against cutting benefits. The new platform amplifies rhetoric Trump frequently uses on the campaign trail, with a focus on immigration, calling for the border to be sealed. It also calls for ending \u201cthe weaponization of government against the American people.\u201d The platform was approved by an overwhelming vote of 84-18 during a closed-door vote, according to the source. The platform will be taken up at the full party convention, which begins in Milwaukee next week. This story and headline have been updated.

{"id": "2024_07_05_politics_biden-july-4-reelection-pressure-abc-interview", "text": "Every time things look like they can\u2019t get worse for President Joe Biden, they seem to do just that. The Fourth of July holiday brought no respite after Biden\u2019s disastrous debate performance, which raised concerns about his capacity to serve a second term and pitched his reelection campaign into an existential crisis. And the scrutiny will only increase on Friday with the airing of an ABC interview that will provide a critical test of the president\u2019s ability to stem panic in the Democratic Party exactly four months from Election Day. The latest effort by the White House to quell the controversy is already disintegrating.\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0and\u00a0CNN reported Thursday\u00a0that the president had told Democratic state governors that he needed more sleep and that he\u2019d no longer schedule events after 8 p.m., three sources briefed on the comments said. His reasoning frustrated several governors who\u2019d come to the White House to seek reassurance about Biden\u2019s condition, sources said. And it is likely to raise further questions about whether the president is fit to fully execute the duties of the presidency now, let alone toward the end of a second term, when he would be 86. Biden\u2019s comment may also infuriate Democrats who want him to be far more visible and to throw himself into spontaneous, unscripted events to prove his stamina and sharpness. But Biden issued another defiant warning that he has no intention of stepping down, a day after several allies privately said he\u2019s aware that the coming days could be critical for his hopes of staying in the race. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d Biden told military families gathered to watch July Fourth fireworks at the White House. The administration\u2019s attempts to explain away the president\u2019s poor debate performance keep having the opposite effect. So far, Biden aides, officials or allies have suggested that he was overloaded by his debate prep team; that he was suffering from jet lag after two European trips, even though the debate took place more than a week after he got home; and that he had a cold. The White House\u2019s credibility took another hit Thursday when\u00a0it said that the president had in fact seen a physician\u00a0in the days following the debate, despite White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre having said the day before that the president hadn\u2019t been examined since his last full physical in February. The next big test in the president\u2019s comeback bid Biden\u2019s latest difficulties are only ramping up the pressure ahead of his critical interview that will air Friday night on ABC. The sit-down with George Stephanopoulos is one of the campaign\u2019s own self-imposed tests for Biden to dispel the image of a shaky and at times confused president that was seared into the minds of 50 million viewers at the CNN debate. Any sign of compromised mental sharpness in the interview could deal another blow to the campaign.\u00a0Democrats will also want Biden to make a powerful case for a second term and to adequately prosecute his argument against Trump \u2014 both arguments he failed to deliver during the debate in Atlanta last week. \u201cI had a bad night,\u201d Biden said in a radio interview on \u201cThe Earl Ingram Show,\u201d conducted on Wednesday. \u201cAnd the fact of the matter is, that, you know, it was \u2014 I screwed up. I made a mistake. That\u2019s 90 minutes on stage. Look at what I\u2019ve done in 3.5 years.\u201d The problem with the president\u2019s argument is that the debate debacle has forced voters to consider not just the successes of his administration \u2014 which are comparable with those of any other modern Democratic president \u2014 but also whether they can imagine an even slower and more fragile president being in office years from now. The fallout from the debate is so potentially damaging because Biden\u2019s performance appeared to confirm the views of overwhelming majorities of voters that the president, at 81, is too old to be running for a second term. A week of building crisis has obliterated, at least temporarily, the comparison the Biden campaign had long hoped to draw with Trump, who is promising a campaign of retribution if he\u2019s reelected and who almost destroyed democracy in refusing to accept his loss in the 2020 election. And it means that every Biden appearance is now drawing a painful measure of scrutiny. On Thursday evening, he made it through a speech using familiar lines at the Independence Day party. His sentiments were deeply felt, but the effects of the president\u2019s advanced age were obvious, especially by comparison with public events from a few years ago. Democratic anxiety grows At least two Democratic lawmakers have so far called for Biden to step aside before the Democratic National Convention in August, and there is intense behind-the-scenes anxiety among party lawmakers who fear the president\u2019s problems could drag them down and hand the White House \u2014 as well as the Senate and the House of Representatives \u2014 to Republicans. Even Democrats who are standing firm behind Biden want him to do more to prove to voters that he is up to the job of a second White House term. Rep. Debbie Dingell, who represents a district in Michigan \u2014 a critical swing state in November \u2014 said Thursday on \u201cCNN This Morning\u201d that there was \u201ca lot of fear\u201d among voters about Biden\u2019s debate showing but added that voters also recognize the delicate process involved in any attempt to find a new nominee. She argued that Trump had also had a bad debate but implored Biden to step up the pace of his campaigning. \u201cHe\u2019s got to go out there and show it this week,\u201d she said. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who was in the\u00a0governors\u2019 meeting at the White House on Wednesday, vigorously defended Biden after campaigning on his behalf in Michigan. And he downplayed potential Biden schedule curtailments, which are certain to be seized upon by Republicans to reinforce their arguments that he is not up to the job of commander-in-chief. \u201cThat\u2019s called human,\u201d Newsom told CNN. \u201cAnd God bless, I like when a president acknowledges they\u2019re human. And so I think people are reading between the lines too much on that.\u201d Newsom, seen as a potential alternative contender if\u00a0Biden\u00a0decides to exit the race, was asked whether he would support Vice President Kamala Harris as the presidential nominee in such circumstances. He said he\u2019s \u201cnot going to play into that\u201d but acknowledged the question was legitimate. Biden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz noted that Trump hardly showed rigor, claiming the ex-president \u201cspends half of his day ranting on Truth Social about plans that would cause a recession and the other half golfing.\u201d And he said that \u201cnormal presidents strike a balance,\u201d arguing that President George W. Bush went to bed at 9 p.m. and President Barack Obama had dinner with his family at 6:30 at night \u2014 a concession, however, to his daughters\u2019 youth, not Obama\u2019s age at the time Biden\u2019s struggles are forcing the Trump campaign to contemplate a possibly changing electoral equation. The former president has now started to augment his attacks\u00a0on his successor\u00a0with new attempts to single out the vice president in apparent preparation for a potential switch of Democratic nominees. And on Thursday, the presumptive GOP nominee offered to\u00a0debate Biden one-on-one with without moderators.\u00a0\u201cI have the answer to the Crooked Joe Biden Incompetence Puzzle \u2014 Let\u2019s do another Debate, but this time, no holds barred - An all on discussion, with just the two of us on stage, talking about the future of our Country,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social. Trump has moved into a slight lead in several national polls following the debate, breaking out of what was for months a neck-and-neck race within the margin of error. The increasingly unpromising state of the Biden campaign has many Democrats worried \u2014 one reason the ABC News interview and a scheduled press conference at the NATO summit in Washington next week will be so crucial. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got to take a very sober look at the reality of the race as it currently stands,\u201d California Democratic Rep. Jared Huffman said Thursday on \u201cCNN News Central.\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just one bad night; it was a bad night that may have locked in a really unfortunate narrative about President Biden\u2019s age and fitness, and that narrative could be very hard to undo,\u201d Huffman said. Spelling out a scenario that is chilling Democrats and that may soon bring concerns about Biden to a critical point, Huffman added: \u201cWe\u2019re four months before the election and the guy who\u2019s threatening our democracy, our fundamental rights in the free world right now is winning.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/politics/biden-july-4-reelection-pressure-abc-interview/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_politics_biden-student-loan-program-republicans", "text": "Three Republican-led states on Tuesday asked the Supreme Court to block a Biden administration effort to lower monthly payments for\u00a0millions of student loan borrowers. At issue is a program created last year that lowers enrolled borrowers\u2019 monthly payments and provides a faster route to debt forgiveness. The program was launched by the Biden administration following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision last year to strike down a broader student loan forgiveness program. The emergency appeal from South Carolina, Alaska and Texas comes days after a federal appeals court in Denver allowed the program to be implemented. It once again places the issue of student loan relief \u2014 a key promise made by then-candidate Joe Biden in 2020 \u2014 before the conservative Supreme Court. \u201cDue to the administration\u2019s intransigence, the court must unfortunately step in again,\u201d the states argued in their filing, which also asks the Supreme Court to review the legality of the program. The high court is expected to set a briefing schedule and could decide whether to block the program, known as Saving on a Valuable Education,\u00a0within a few weeks. Nearly 8 million people are enrolled in SAVE, and roughly 3 million of them were expecting to see lower payments as of July 1 when the plan was fully phased in. After lower courts initially blocked the plan, the Department of Education said those 3 million borrowers would be put in a forbearance \u2014 during which payments would not be required and interest would not accrue \u2014 while the matter was litigated. But after the appeals court sided with the Biden administration Sunday, the Department of Education can move ahead and make those reductions. The Department of Education said last week that borrowers who were not already placed in a forbearance due to the litigation would see their payments cut by as much as half in July. Those put in a forbearance would see the reduction of their payment starting in August. The SAVE plan calculates monthly student loan payments based on a borrower\u2019s income and family size \u2014 regardless of how much debt they owe. About 4 million borrowers enrolled in SAVE have a $0 monthly payment. The Department of Education did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the emergency appeal filed Tuesday. Two groups of Republican-led states filed lawsuits challenging the program earlier this year. In the case now before the Supreme Court, a district court temporarily blocked the plan\u2019s implementation, but the 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals paused that decision late last month.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/politics/biden-student-loan-program-republicans/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_politics_rfk-cornel-west-ballot-north-carolina", "text": "North Carolina\u2019s elections board has deferred a decision on allowing Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Cornel West on the state\u2019s ballot after learning that some voters who signed petitions to help the independent presidential hopefuls gain ballot access did not understand the purpose of those petitions. The findings potentially lend credence to some of the objections filed by allies of President Joe Biden seeking to block access for the two candidates in the key battleground state. At a North Carolina State\u00a0Board\u00a0of\u00a0Elections\u00a0hearing on Tuesday, board staff shared\u00a0that they\u00a0had reached out to\u00a0voters\u00a0who\u00a0signed\u00a0petitions\u00a0to help the minor parties established by Kennedy and West to gain ballot access in the state and found\u00a0that some\u00a0of\u00a0them \u201cwere not told the\u00a0purpose\u00a0and intent or did not understand the\u00a0purpose\u00a0and intent\u201d\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0petitions\u00a0they\u00a0signed. In its objections to both Kennedy and West\u2019s ballot access, the pro-Biden super PAC Clear Choice claimed that both candidates were \u201cmisleading\u201d voters who signed their petitions, arguing that the candidates had violated a state law that requires newly formed political parties to inform signers of the \u201cgeneral purpose and intent\u201d of the party. An elections board\u00a0staff member reached out to 26\u00a0voters\u00a0who\u00a0signed\u00a0the Kennedy campaign\u2019s petition to get his We The People party on the ballot and 66 people who\u00a0signed\u00a0the\u00a0West\u00a0campaign\u2019s petition to help his Justice For All party qualify. West\u2019s campaign submitted over 17,000 validated signatures, while Kennedy\u2019s campaign submitted over 18,500 validated signatures. Minor parties must submit at least 13,000 valid signatures to be considered for approval by North Carolina\u2019s\u00a0elections\u00a0board. Board staff also spoke to 12 North Carolina voters who said they did not recall signing petitions to help West qualify for the state\u2019s ballot. None of the Kennedy petition signatories recalled not supporting his ballot access, staff said. The\u00a0elections board\u00a0did not take action Tuesday, with board chair Alan Hirsch saying that staffers were still reviewing materials submitted during the petition process for both\u00a0minor parties. Tuesday\u2019s brief meeting revealed partisan tensions on the five-seat\u00a0board, which features three Democrats and two Republicans. The Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee criticized the\u00a0board\u00a0for delaying a ruling at a hearing last month. Following last month\u2019s hearing, a conservative-aligned group called Fair Election Fund launched an ad campaign targeting the Democratic members of the board for \u201cblocking Biden\u2019s competition from the ballot.\u201d Kevin Lewis, a Republican elections\u00a0board\u00a0member, suggested Tuesday that the\u00a0board\u00a0had an ulterior reason for delaying a ruling, saying, \u201cYour motives are being questioned.\u201d Democratic\u00a0board\u00a0member Siobhan O\u2019Duffy Millen criticized the attacks on the\u00a0board, citing the Fair\u00a0Election\u00a0Fund ads. \u201cSome\u00a0of\u00a0the rhetoric is a little bit out\u00a0of\u00a0hand,\u201d O\u2019Duffy Millen said. \u201cSome\u00a0of\u00a0these ads that are very personal are unfortunate.\u201d Meanwhile, Kennedy has qualified for Minnesota\u2019s presidential ballot, a state elections official told CNN on Tuesday. He\u2019s also qualified in Michigan, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Delaware, California, Hawaii and Utah \u2013 making him eligible to compete for 110 electoral votes in total.

{"id": "2024_07_08_politics_dnc-delegates-biden-loyalty", "text": "Democrats urging President Joe Biden to end his campaign and allow the party to select another nominee before \u2013 or during \u2013 August\u2019s national convention are unlikely to find allies in the ranks of Chicago-bound delegates, who are increasingly closing ranks around Biden. Ten days after the president\u2019s debate debacle, following an initial surge of Democratic anxiety and calls for him to stand down, a host of party leaders and rank-and-file members selected to formally nominate Biden said they were loath to consider any other option. For many of the more than two dozen delegates interviewed by CNN over the last 48 hours, the debate remains a sore subject. Though a few sought to cast Biden\u2019s performance as an untimely aberration, most argued that, despite the angst they and so many others felt watching the president struggle, the tumult that\u2019s followed is a distraction from the party\u2019s unifying aim: To defeat former President Donald Trump in November and crush the most ambitious plans of his right-wing loyalists. Their concerns over the prospect of Biden bowing out are twofold. A host of pledged delegates warned that the process for replacing the president \u2013 should he relinquish the nomination and release his delegates \u2013 would do more damage than even the worst-case scenario with Biden atop the ticket. Most, though, refused to even consider the hypothetical \u2013 a mark of both their belief in the president and, going back months, the Biden campaign\u2019s work to screen for loyal delegates. Biden-aligned delegates also expressed, often privately, a lack of confidence in the alternatives, arguing that Biden, for all the agita following the debate, remains a better bet than any of the names whipping around the gossip circuit. To the extent they were willing to countenance a succession plan, there was overwhelming support for Vice President Kamala Harris, who \u2013 both as a logistical and political matter \u2013 would in their views likely encounter the fewest roadblocks. For the most part, though, Biden\u2019s most ardent delegates were singing from the same hymn sheet. Chris Anderson, chair of the delegate selection process in Tennessee and a local government official, argued \u2013 as Biden\u2019s campaign has done \u2013 that voters aren\u2019t as interested in the president\u2019s debate performance as the political media. \u201cThe punditry class has a job to do, and I understand that, but they seem to think the debate was a bigger deal than regular people think it was because most regular people were focused on the 90 minutes of lies spewed by Donald Trump,\u201d Anderson said. Stephen Gaskill, the former president of the Florida LGBTQ+ Democratic Caucus, told CNN he had no plans to look any further into his responsibilities as a delegate. Like so many others, he acknowledged that Biden flopped on the debate stage in Atlanta, but said he was not entertaining the idea of a candidate swap. \u201cThere is no plan B. The president is the nominee,\u201d Gaskill said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where I and everyone that I\u2019ve been talking to stands \u2013 until and unless he says otherwise. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s likely.\u201d Colorado state Rep. Meg Froelich said she found the post-debate narrative \u201cfrustrating\u201d given the stark differences between Biden and Trump, who was convicted of 34 felony counts earlier this year in New York and faces three other criminal indictments. \u201cThis whole idea that someone\u2019s going to ride in on a white horse and unify everyone, and we\u2019re all going to get excited \u2026 Biden is our nominee,\u201d said Froelich, who also praised Harris. \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem supporting him.\u201d In Massachusetts, Democratic strategist Joe Caiazzo \u2014 who helped organize a write-in campaign for Biden in New Hampshire because he wasn\u2019t on the primary ballot after a calendar dispute \u2014 said he was exasperated by the relentless focus on Biden\u2019s missteps. \u201cThe debate performance obviously could have been better, significantly better,\u201d Caiazzo said. \u201cAnd I think that it was clear that the narrative coming out of the debate would be more about Joe Biden\u2019s performance than what Donald Trump actually said.\u201d He also questioned the motives of some of the voices calling for Biden to quit. \u201cThere are people in the party who are looking for a reason to sideline Biden from the beginning,\u201d Caiazzo said, \u201cwhich was clear through my work on the write-in effort.\u201d Delegates willing to go public with their calls for Biden to drop out have typically been less closely tied to the campaign and Democratic Party infrastructure. Rishi Kumar, a Biden delegate from California and former Saratoga City councilmember, said he began researching Democratic National Committee rules for replacing a candidate a year ago. \u201cThe process is probably as clear as mud right now,\u201d Kumar said. \u201cThe DNC committee will have to come up with a plan, whether Biden drops out before or at the convention or even after.\u201d The debate was an \u201ceye opener,\u201d he said, and Biden\u2019s interview with ABC News broadcast on Friday didn\u2019t help. Kumar, who ran for retiring Democratic Rep. Anna Eshoo\u2019s Silicon Valley House seat but did not advance out of the primary, said he was worried down-ballot Democrats would be political \u201croadkill\u201d if Biden didn\u2019t exit the race. \u201cWith so many vulnerable Democrats who are running in the House and Senate, those seats might be up for grabs if Biden becomes the roadblock,\u201d said Kumar, who told CNN that he would back California Gov. Gavin Newsom for the presidential nomination if the opportunity arose. Biden and his campaign began a blitz of personal outreach after the initial shock of the debate subsided, trying to lock down support with party leaders \u2013 including governors and members of Congress \u2013 whose decisions could pave the way for others to register their concerns. They have also hammered a public message that a faceless blob of Democratic \u201celites\u201d is trying to step over the will of primary voters. \u201cI\u2019m getting so frustrated by the elites,\u201d a combative Biden said during a call-in to MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on Monday. \u201cThey know so much more. But if any of these guys don\u2019t think I should run \u2013 run against me. Good. Announce \u2014 announce for president. Challenge me at the convention.\u201d So far, six Democratic House members have publicly asked Biden to stand down. A handful  \u2013 most in senior positions \u2013 said the same during a weekend call with the party\u2019s House leadership, according to sources briefed on the discussion. That number could grow on Tuesday, when House lawmakers hold their first caucus meeting with Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries since the debate. Though one member told CNN the dam could break soon after that gathering, most Democratic elected officials, activists and delegates have, so far, been careful not to be seen speaking out of school. There is also a concerted \u2013 if decentralized \u2013 push to downplay anxiety over Biden as typical liberal \u201cbedwetting,\u201d as the campaign itself described it in a fundraising email after the debate. Organizers on the ground chafed at that language, which the campaign has mostly backed off from, and pointed to it as evidence that Biden and his top aides are disconnected from the situation on the ground. \u201cI think (the calls for Biden to quit) are a function of people who understand the stakes, as Joe Biden himself put it, which is that democracy is on the line and we can\u2019t go upward to go into this fight with one or two hands tied behind our back, which is what we\u2019ll have to do if Joe Biden\u2019s the nominee,\u201d said one Democratic strategist who works closely with a network of grassroots groups around the country. Kevin Tolbert, a first-time delegate and district chair for the Michigan Democratic Party, described the debate as road bump in Biden\u2019s path to reelection \u2013 an opinion he\u2019s shared with doubters. \u201cThe message I\u2019ve been saying to people is this is not the time for us to be caught into our feelings. This is not about who we love or an emotional response,\u201d Tolbert said. \u201cThis is the time for us to be very cerebral and very intelligent and make sure we educate people over what\u2019s occurring.\u201d Alan Geraci, a California-based delegate for Biden who is still supportive of him, said the president\u2019s debate performance was \u201cabysmal\u201d and he shouldn\u2019t have taken the stage that night if he was sick or exhausted, as the White House has suggested he was. In the aftermath of that performance, Geraci said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d the Biden campaign wasn\u2019t more aggressive with his public appearances. \u201cThey had that next-day North Carolina campaign event that went well, but then it kind of languished for a week,\u201d said Geraci, who is also running for the San Marcos City Council. \u201cI thought that was a huge mistake, that Biden needed to be out there and convincing people that he\u2019s ready for the task, and that the debate indeed was a one-off.\u201d Like many delegates, Geraci has been following the president\u2019s public appearances in the days after the debate. Biden\u2019s interview with ABC was \u201cbetter than the debate,\u201d he said, but not a home run. Geraci was more pleased with positive responses Biden received after a Sunday appearance at a Black church in Philadelphia. \u201cI felt very confident that that\u2019s what he needs to do every single day,\u201d he said. Geraci also pointed to the 1944 election, when ailing Democratic President Franklin Delano Roosevelt campaigned aggressively to overcome public questions about his health, as further evidence that \u201cthe most effective defense is a good, strong offense.\u201d Roosevelt died five months after the election, which he won in a landslide. Former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner, a DNC member and close ally of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders during his presidential runs, dismissed any suggestion that delegates were poised \u2013 or inclined \u2013 to launch a \u201crogue takeover.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen. The only way the convention is truly going be open is if Biden says, \u2018I\u2019m not gonna run and I release my delegates,\u2019\u201d Turner said. \u201cUnless something spectacularly more daunting than what we saw on that debate stage happens, it\u2019s totally in his hands.\u201d Michigan Rep. Haley Stevens, a vocal Biden backer in a House Democratic conference that has shown signs of fracturing, said she had not heard much about the potential for an open convention from her constituents. If a fellow delegate asked for her take, Stevens said, she would point to the scoreboard. \u201cIf I was talking to a delegate in Michigan\u2019s 11th District, in the heart of Oakland County, I would say that 87% of our district voted for Joe Biden, like overwhelmingly,\u201d she told CNN. But Stevens also warned Democrats \u2013 in and outside of Washington \u2013 to choose their words carefully, with a thought for the party\u2019s ability to come together in the fall, as the discourse around Biden heats up. \u201cThis is kind of like disagreeing with your spouse or a family member,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cYou really gotta watch what you say in these moments.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/politics/dnc-delegates-biden-loyalty/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_politics_biden-nato-summit-ukraine-aid", "text": "President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced plans to supply new air defenses to Ukraine in a speech opening the NATO summit \u2013 providing much-needed support for the country at a critical juncture in its defense against Russia\u2019s invasion. The US, Germany, and Romania will each provide a Patriot battery of their own, while the Netherlands will work with other countries to enable an additional Patriot battery, each country announced in a joint statement. Meanwhile, Italy would also provide a SAMP-T long-range air defense system. The statement said the air-defense systems \u201cwill help to protect Ukrainian cities, civilians, and soldiers, and we are coordinating with the Ukrainian government so that these systems can be utilized rapidly.\u201d During his speech on Tuesday, Biden vowed that \u201cthe United States will make sure that when we export critical air defense interceptors, Ukraine goes to the front of the line.\u201d \u201cThey will get this assistance before anyone else gets it,\u201d Biden added. Israel also receives defensive interceptors from the United States, though the country relies far more on its Iron Dome to intercept drones and rockets. The US had previously discussed sending Patriot interceptors in Israel to Ukraine. In addition to the long-range aerial defense systems, the US and other countries are also providing Ukraine with \u201cdozens\u201d of short- and medium-range systems to help Kyiv intercept Russian drones and missiles. The systems including NASAMS, HAWKs, IRIS T-SLM, IRIS T-SLS, and Gepard systems. Canada, Norway, Spain, the UK and other countries will \u201cplay an integral role\u201d in providing the systems to Ukraine, while \u201cmany other supporters\u201d will provide the interceptor missiles, the statement said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr\u00a0Zelensky said he would fight for \u201cdecisive actions\u201d from\u00a0the United States\u00a0and Europe to help Ukraine. \u201cIt is not only our country that needs it \u2013 everyone needs it, literally every partner, all nations,\u201d Zelensky said in his first remarks after arriving in the US. The Ukrainian president said he would ask for more air defense systems, F-16 fighter jets, and additional security guarantees, \u201cincluding weapons and finances, political support.\u201d One day before Biden\u2019s announcement, Russian strikes across Ukraine killed at least 22 people and injured 68 more, according to Ukrainian officials, including a strike on the country\u2019s largest children\u2019s hospital. On Monday evening, Biden called the strikes a \u201chorrific reminder of Russia\u2019s brutality.\u201d Two-and-a-half years into the war with Russia, Zelensky has repeatedly asked allied nations to strengthen his country\u2019s air defenses to thwart Moscow\u2019s military prowess overhead. The United States has been a crucial ally to Ukraine since Russia\u2019s invasion in 2022 \u2013 but the future of that alliance has been thrown into question. Former President Donald Trump has said he would pressure Ukraine into a peace deal with Russia that would see Kyiv cede territory in the process if he wins the presidency. Earlier this year, Trump said he would allow Russia to do \u201cwhatever the hell they want\u201d with countries that don\u2019t meet NATO defense-funding obligations. Support for Ukraine was also a prime topic at this year\u2019s G7 summit in Italy, where Biden and Zelensky signed an agreement that commits the US for 10 years to continued training of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces, more cooperation in the production of weapons and military equipment, the continued provision of military assistance and greater intelligence sharing. But that agreement could be undone under a different administration. Biden spoke Tuesday from the Mellon Auditorium, where the North Atlantic Treaty was signed in 1949 \u2013 creating the alliance \u2013 and where former President Bill Clinton held the alliance\u2019s 50th\u00a0anniversary summit. Given the backdrop, Biden leaned into the history of the alliance and the trajectory of the threats it has faced \u2013 and argued that, under his leadership, NATO has become stronger than ever. \u201cAll we allies knew before this war Putin thought NATO would break,\u201d Biden said. \u201cToday, NATO is stronger than its ever been in its history.\u201d He concluded his speech by presenting NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Biden\u2019s remarks were scripted and read from a teleprompter, but the stakes were high for the president as many members of his own party and the public writ large are watching him closely following his poor debate performance late last month. Some members of his own party have recently said\u00a0they want more evidence of his mental and physical fitness before deciding whether to back him for four more years. Biden largely got through his speech without any major hiccups, though he did appear to accidentally read stage instructions from his prepared remarks while presenting the medal to Stoltenberg. Though foreign diplomats were horrified by Biden\u2019s debate performance, the president has several more chances to prove himself this week \u2013 including during a solo press conference on Thursday.

{"id": "2024_07_08_politics_parkinsons-specialist-white-house", "text": "A top Parkinson\u2019s disease specialist held a meeting with President Joe Biden\u2019s physician at the White House earlier this year, according to records, though the circumstances of the meeting are unclear. Dr. Kevin Cannard, a neurologist at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, met with White House physician Dr. Kevin O\u2019Connor at the White House in mid-January, according to White House visitor logs. Cannard has visited the White House three times this year, according to the visitor logs: A January 17 meeting with O\u2019Connor, and with another staffer on January 26 and March 28. Cannard has visited the White House at least eight times over the past year, according to the logs, beginning last August and ending with the March 28 meeting. Only the January 17 meeting lists O\u2019Connor as the person who was visited. O\u2019Connor took the unusual step Monday night of releasing a letter offering some details about Cannard\u2019s visits to the White House, following days of speculation about the president\u2019s health, writing that \u201cPresident Biden has not seen a neurologist outside of his annual physical.\u201d He wrote of Cannard: \u201cPrior to the pandemic, and following its end, he has held regular Neurology Clinics at the White House Medical Clinic in support of the thousands of active-duty members assigned in support of White House operations,\u201d\u00a0adding, \u201cMany military personnel experience neurological issues related to their service, and Dr. Cannard regularly visits the WHMU as part of this General Neurology practice.\u201d O\u2019Connor described Cannard as the \u201cneurological specialist that examined President Biden for each of his annual physicals\u201d and noted the specialist\u2019s findings were included each time he publicly released the results of the president\u2019s physical. Asked earlier Monday about the visit between Cannard and O\u2019Connor, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said, \u201cA\u00a0wide variety of specialists from the Walter Reed system visit the White House complex to treat the thousands of military personnel who work on the grounds.\u201d Those visits include one from a neurologist each year for Biden\u2019s physical, Bates said. Biden has not been seen by a neurologist during his time as president outside the context of his annual physical, he added. Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre later repeated Biden had been seen by a neurologist three times during his presidency \u2013 once during each of his physicals \u2013 but declined to name them or explain why Cannard had visited the White House eight times over the past year. She said she wouldn\u2019t name the specialist due to security reasons. Publicly available profiles name Cannard as a neurology specialist supporting the White House Medical Unit. \u201cI am not sharing, confirming names from here,\u201d she said during the news briefing, which quickly became contentious as Jean-Pierre deflected questions about the president\u2019s health. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how hard you push me, it doesn\u2019t matter how angry you get with me, I\u2019m not going to confirm a name, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s even in the log, I am not going to do that from here.\u201d Jean-Pierre added Biden has never been treated for, or taken any medicine to treat, Parkinson\u2019s. Cannard \u2014 who\u2019s worked as a neurologist for Walter Reed for more than a decade \u2014 has visited the White House multiple times,\u00a0according to the visitor logs, which don\u2019t detail the reasons for the visit, including whether Cannard was visiting in reference to Biden or another person who works at the White House. Biden\u2019s latest health report, released by O\u2019Connor, indicated the president had been screened for a number of neurological conditions, including Parkinson\u2019s, with negative results, as did two other physical reports from Biden\u2019s time as president. The six-page letter from O\u2019Connor, released after the president underwent his last physical in February, said several specialists consulted on the physical, including a neurological specialist. It later said O\u2019Connor convened several specialists, including an unnamed movement-disorder neurologic specialist, to review Biden\u2019s stiffened gait, which had been noted since Biden\u2019s November 2021 physical. That team concluded Biden\u2019s stiff gait was the result of \u201cwear and tear\u201d on his spine and not a neurological condition, O\u2019Connor wrote. An \u201cextremely detailed\u201d exam resulted in no findings consistent with Parkinson\u2019s, multiple sclerosis, or other neurological disorders. News of the visit by Cannard comes as Biden\u2019s age, fitness and mental acuity have been under intense scrutiny following his faltering June 27 presidential debate performance against former President Donald Trump. In the 11 days since that performance, Biden has had to defend his position on the top of the Democratic ticket and his ability to govern for another four years if he is reelected. Both the White House and Biden have repeatedly been asked about tests and doctors visits in the months before the debate and the moments after.  Biden was asked in an ABC interview on Friday whether he had taken specific tests for cognitive capability. The president responded by saying he is regularly seen by White House doctors and added, \u201cNo one said I had to \u2026 they said I\u2019m good.\u201d The president also added that he spoke with his doctor and was told, \u201cYou\u2019re exhausted.\u201d Biden said, \u201cBeing president\u201d means \u201cI get a full neurological test every day.\u201d Speaking with Biden during an interview Monday morning, MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski asked Biden specifically whether he had undergone any recent tests for Parkinson\u2019s. Biden confirmed he had. \u201cHave you been tested for any age-related illness, pre-Parkinson\u2019s or anything like that, that might explain sort of having a night like that where you couldn\u2019t finish sentences?\u201d the MSNBC host asked. Biden laughed before responding: \u201cI had before.\u201d The president added: \u201cI was feeling so badly before the debate, when I came back, they tested me for - I thought maybe I had COVID, maybe there was something wrong, I had an infection or something. They tested me, they gave me those tests, I was clear.\u201d The White House and Biden campaign have alternatively blamed Biden\u2019s poor performance during the debate on his packed travel schedule in the weeks before \u2013 Biden went to France to commemorate the anniversary of D-Day and Italy to attend the G7 \u2013 and a cold. The White House initially said Biden wasn\u2019t seen by a doctor after the debate, but then reversed after Biden told a group of governors during a meeting last week that he underwent a medical checkup after the debate and is fine.

{"id": "2024_07_09_politics_zelensky-ukraine-nato-summit", "text": "Ukrainian\u00a0President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Washington, DC,\u00a0as the\u00a0high-stakes NATO summit prepared to kick off \u2013\u00a0and providing long-term support for Ukraine in the war against Russia\u00a0is\u00a0at\u00a0the top of the agenda. The Ukrainian leader will seek to shore up and boost allied support for\u00a0his country, meet with President Joe Biden, and deliver a major speech on the sidelines of the summit. The US has promised \u201csignificant\u201d announcements\u00a0on\u00a0Ukraine during the three-day global gathering\u00a0that begins Tuesday. Ahead of the summit, NATO members made clear that Ukraine would be the main focus. \u201cThe priority one, two, and three is Ukraine,\u201d a European diplomat said. However, there are looming questions whether the shows of support will be enough as the war drags on with little sign of a quick diplomatic or military victory for Kyiv. Concerns about the future of NATO should Donald Trump win November\u2019s presidential election are also top of mind for many attendees who were not reassured by Biden\u2019s disastrous CNN debate performance. Zelensky touched down in the US capital on Monday evening in the shadow of deadly Russian attacks on cities throughout Ukraine earlier that day. The barrage of missiles hit buildings across the country, including Ukraine\u2019s largest children\u2019s hospital, and killed more than three dozen people. On Tuesday evening, the US and some of its NATO allies announced they will give Ukraine more Patriot batteries and additional systems to strengthen Kyiv\u2019s air defenses against ongoing Russian aerial barrages. The US, Germany and Romania will each provide a Patriot battery of their own, while the Netherlands will work with other countries to enable an additional Patriot battery, according to a joint statement. Meanwhile, Italy would also provide a SAMP-T long-range air defense system. \u201cThis is yet another significant step following the US decision to prioritize Ukraine in air defense missile deliveries,\u201d Zelensky wrote on X following the announcement. \u201cI am grateful to President Biden for his leadership and to all partner countries for their commitment to providing us with air defense capabilities as quickly as possible. \u201cRussia\u2019s air terror against Ukrainians, including yesterday\u2019s brutal strike on the children\u2019s hospital, must be met with unity and strength, with resolute and bold decisions. And that is precisely what such decisions ensure,\u201d he wrote. Officials said the timing of Moscow\u2019s assault \u2013 a day before the start of the summit \u2013 was calculated. It was \u201ca hello from Putin to all the NATO countries \u2026 making fun of us trying to follow red lines,\u201d as Ruslan\u00a0Stefanchuk, the chair of Ukraine\u2019s parliament, said. They also said the attack underscored the need for continued military support for Ukraine \u2013 and the ability to use those weapons to strike targets deep inside Russian territory. \u201cThis attack, this attack on Ukraine\u2019s future \u2013 because children are our future \u2013 shall not remain unresponded,\u201d Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in remarks alongside US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday. \u201cI am looking forward to our discussion on how we can further strengthen Ukraine\u2019s defense capabilities.\u201d \u201cWe want the lifting of any sort of limitations on the weapons Ukraine is receiving,\u201d\u00a0Stefanchuk\u00a0said at an event in Washington on Monday. The Biden administration recently shifted its policy to allow US weapons to be used in strikes into Russian territory where Russian forces are engaging in cross-border attacks into Ukraine. However, Ukrainian officials want to see that policy expanded further to allow strikes against Russian military targets anywhere in Russian territory. Stefanchuk on Monday called for \u201ca stable and forecastable supply of these weapons,\u201d ammunition and to be able to \u201ceffectively counter the threats from the skies,\u201d meaning F-16 fighter jets. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to wait for another sanctions package like an iPhone package,\u201d he said, noting they just need one kind of sanctions: ones that \u201cwill make Russia feel the economic pain for this war.\u201d In remarks when he arrived in the US capital, Zelensky said Kyiv will fight for \u201cdecisive actions\u201d from the United States and Europe at the summit Ukraine also wants clear progress towards membership in NATO. The matter caused a diplomatic spat last year ahead of the summit in Vilnius, with Zelensky fuming that\u00a0it was \u201cunprecedented and absurd when time frame is not set neither for the invitation nor for Ukraine\u2019s membership\u201d to NATO. This year, officials said there has been far greater communication with the Ukrainians in the lead up to the summit. The European diplomat said there have been \u201cdeep and frank conversations\u201d with Ukrainian officials. Presidential adviser Andriy Yermak was in Washington last week in part to work on commitments ahead of the summit. As CNN reported Monday,\u00a0Ukraine\u2019s path to NATO was described as \u201cirreversible\u201d in a draft text of the alliance\u2019s joint communique, according to three sources familiar. Still, some say that there must be a stronger commitment to Ukraine. A senior European diplomat quipped that \u201cthis irreversibility is very much reversible.\u201d A senior Biden administration official said Friday that what they \u201cdescribed in terms of the bridge to membership and the deliverables that NATO will be unveiling for Ukraine is quite substantial.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about some sort of plan for how they\u2019re going to get from here to there. We\u2019re talking about standing up an entire command at Wiesbaden and we\u2019ll look at how we do these various pieces that I mentioned earlier \u2013 training, coordination, equipping, coordination, logistics, force development. This is a very serious effort to get Ukraine in a position, as I said earlier, where it will be ready to assume its roles and responsibilities within the alliance on day one,\u201d the official said. \u201cI\u2019ll let the Ukrainians speak for themselves, but I think they understand the value of what NATO will be doing for that,\u201d they said.

{"id": "2024_07_09_politics_doubters-joe-biden-campaign-election", "text": "Joe Biden is betting on himself. In the president\u2019s telling, the pundits have always doubted him. The Washington class has always scoffed at his approach. He was never the darling of Democratic donors. The polls that show moribund approval ratings and widespread unease with his age don\u2019t capture his true standing. The defiance Biden has thrust into public view at the start of a critical week is a feature, not a bug. \u201cI\u2019m getting frustrated by the elites in the party, \u2018Oh, they know so much more,\u2019\u201d he said in a surprise call-in interview Monday on MSNBC. \u201cAny of these guys that don\u2019t think I should run, run against me. Announce for president. Challenge me at the convention.\u201d Biden\u2019s public comments, which echoed a Monday morning letter to Democratic lawmakers, revealed flashes of what animates the president and his team, now staring down a moment of peak political peril. His closest advisers have long carried a similar boulder-size chip on their shoulders, with ready examples of their boss being doubted, dismissed or derided over the years. If Biden\u2019s life has been defined by resilience in the face of immense personal tragedy, the consistent element of his hardly linear path to the Oval Office has been a relentless belief that at its core \u2013 whether on politics, policy or legislating \u2013 his approach will work. Biden\u2019s dug-in stance in the wake of the first presidential debate is not too surprising to those who know him well. But it\u2019s also led to frustration among Democrats \u2013 including some long-time supporters of Biden \u2013 who worry that the approach could create a blind spot at a moment when the stakes could not be higher. Biden only served to exacerbate that frustration after his primetime ABC News interview last week, his first major effort to clean up his shaky debate performance. The president, who has made defending democracy a cornerstone of his Oval Office tenure and framed his 2020 campaign against Donald Trump as a \u201cbattle for the soul of the nation,\u201d was asked how he\u2019d feel if he lost to the former president this fall. \u201cI\u2019ll feel as long as I gave it my all, and I did the good as job as I know I can do, that\u2019s what this is about,\u201d Biden said. The answer stunned many Democrats who view Trump as an existential threat to the country and was particularly jarring coming from someone who has made that threat so central to his campaigns and presidency. Biden has since repeatedly moved to underscore his view of the threat he says Trump poses \u2013 and his belief that losing is not an option. But the answer compounded what some Democrats say is the biggest problem with Biden\u2019s dismissal of their concerns about his ability to run and win a second term: reality. \u201cWe all watched the debate,\u201d a House Democrat who supports Biden told CNN. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about questioning campaign mechanics or legislative strategy \u2013 this is a lot heavier than that.\u201d A candidacy at risk As Democrats grapple with Biden\u2019s immediate future in Washington, the campaign ahead looms large. Biden was already trailing Trump in many polls before the debate. The deficits have grown wider since. A clear party-wide desire to focus on, and elevate, Trump and the clear policy contrasts between the two candidates has been swamped by an issue that has bogged down Biden\u2019s candidacy from the beginning: his age As of Monday evening, six\u00a0House Democrats had publicly called on Biden to step aside. A handful of major donors have done the same. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a good message,\u201d Rep. Adam Smith of Washington state, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, told CNN. \u201cThe president has shown he is not capable of delivering that message in an effective way.\u201d Democrats \u2013 both supporters and those still on the fence about his candidacy \u2013 have urged Biden to take clear steps to mollify the concern. Biden\u2019s shift to go on offense at the start of such a consequential week marked an important, if somewhat overdue, step in the right direction, said a Biden donor, who participated in a Monday video call with Biden and other top donors.\u00a0\u201cBut I think it\u2019s understandable that people are still shaken by what they saw.\u201d That group isn\u2019t limited to elected Democrats and donors. Multiple White House officials acknowledged to CNN they were taken aback by Biden\u2019s debate performance, even as they made a point of noting that their access to him wasn\u2019t exactly expansive. Gripes about access to the president are hardly exclusive to the current West Wing operation. But the concern was notable in a White House where officials have long taken pride in subscribing to Biden\u2019s \u201cprove the doubters wrong\u201d approach. But the concerns underscored a level of uncertainty about the long-prevalent \u201cus against the world\u201d posture among his staff. Quelling the anxieties Biden has publicly acknowledged the party anxieties in the days since the debate. \u201cI have heard the concerns that people have \u2013 their good-faith fears and worries about what is at stake in this election,\u201d Biden wrote in his letter to congressional Democrats. \u201cI am not blind to them.\u201d But the acknowledgment has repeatedly been followed by the trait that so often frames his approach to doubters: defiance. Several Democratic officials and donors who spoke with Biden in the wake of his listless debate performance told CNN there were flashes of that defiance in their calls with the president. Among the dozens of fundraising emails fired off by the Biden campaign in the week after the debate were subject lines such as \u201cThe pundits have gotten everything wrong\u201d and \u201cPundits and politicians.\u201d After a weekend of campaign events, Biden made abundantly clear that in his view, it was time to turn the page. \u201cThe question of how to move forward has been well aired for over a week now,\u201d Biden wrote in his letter to House Democrats. \u201cAnd it\u2019s time for it to end. We have one job. And that is to beat Donald Trump.\u201d The message, which came at a critical moment of the 2024 campaign, represented equal parts political necessity for the party and political necessity for the candidate. It was also strategic. Democratic lawmakers were set to return to Washington after the July 4 holiday and meet behind closed doors, where conversations would center on Biden\u2019s political standing, fitness for a second term and whether they should mount an effort to push for a new nominee. On Monday, many Democratic senators appeared to have settled on a posture of not weighing in definitively outside of pressing Biden and his team to take a more sustained and aggressive public approach. Past is prologue Biden\u2019s explicit call to turn the page also carried with it an unequivocal message to those who questioned his candidacy. He isn\u2019t going anywhere. Anyone who questions why that\u2019s his position need only look back over the course of the past decade \u2013 or ask Biden\u2019s closest advisers, who are quick to roll off a lengthy list of examples they see as clear evidence of his record of proving the doubters wrong. As vice president, Biden\u2019s deliberations about a potential 2016 campaign, undertaken in the wake of his son Beau\u2019s death, were met with persistent if cautious resistance from Democrats eager to coalesce behind Hillary Clinton. That the resistance came in no small part from advisers to President Barack Obama is something neither Biden nor his senior team have ever forgotten, particularly after four years of feeling consistently underestimated by some in Obama\u2019s senior orbit. \u201cThe increasing pushback made everybody a little bit angry, and a lot determined,\u201d Biden wrote in his 2017 memoir \u201cPromise Me, Dad,\u201d which recounted the process he and his close advisers pursued as they weighed a run. Biden\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign was all but given its last rites before a stunning turnaround in the South Carolina primary that was followed by a relentless march to the Democratic nomination. Biden\u2019s campaign strategy to largely stay off the campaign trail in the middle of a pandemic faced no shortage of doubters. He ended up defeating Trump by more than 7 million votes. Several of the cornerstone laws that sit at the center of one of the most consequential legislative records for a president in decades once appeared on the brink of defeat \u2013 or defeated altogether. Then final deals came together in time to push through measures such as the bipartisan infrastructure law, the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act. The 2022 midterm elections were set to wipe out House and Senate Democrats alike as Biden\u2019s middling approval ratings and persistently high inflation weighed down the party\u2019s majorities in Congress. Biden\u2019s decision to give two major speeches on democracy in the closing weeks was panned by critics and many Democratic lawmakers as missing the real concerns of voters. And yet when the votes were counted, Democrats had picked up a seat in the Senate and narrowly lost the House \u2013 outcomes that bucked historical trends and polls alike. Exit polling showed that democracy was a top-of-mind issue for voters. In a way, that experience, when taken together with Trump\u2019s return to dominance atop the Republican Party, may have created inertia for the oldest president in US history as he weighed whether to seek reelection. Despite the concerns over his age consistently reflected in surveys, Biden\u2019s decision to run and the Democratic nomination process that followed were less the subject of intensive internal debate and more a formality. Any time Biden was asked about those concerns, he had a two-word retort ready: \u201cWatch me.\u201d Tens of millions of people did, and the result has been a candidacy on the brink in the minds of many Democrats. Biden, who carries a core belief in his agenda, his record and his ability to defeat Trump again, is steadfastly not among them. \u201cThe bottom line here is that we\u2019re not going anywhere. I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d Biden said on MSNBC. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be running if I didn\u2019t think I was the best candidate to beat Donald Trump in 2024.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/politics/doubters-joe-biden-campaign-election/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Russia is \u201cundertaking a whole-of-government approach to influence the election, including the presidential race, Congress and public opinion,\u201d the official said, adding that Russia\u2019s preference for US presidential candidates has not changed from previous election cycles. The official declined to elaborate, but US intelligence previously assessed that in the 2020 US election, Russia conducted a range of influence operations to denigrate Joe Biden\u2019s candidacy and support Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy. Tuesday\u2019s briefing was perhaps the clearest public statement yet from US intelligence agencies on their assessment of how Russia, China and Iran may try to influence a highly polarized American public during a 2024 election. \u201cRussia is a preeminent threat. Iran is a chaos agent, and China is holding fire on the presidential race,\u201d the ODNI official said. \u201cWe assess China, for now, does not plan to influence the outcome of the presidential race, because it sees little gain in choosing between two parties that it perceives as both seeking to contain Beijing,\u201d the official said. All three countries have denied trying to interfere in or influence US elections. ODNI officials did not reveal many specific examples of what they see as Russian election influence activity, but they said it has included familiar tactics such as amplifying influential US voices online to promote the Kremlin\u2019s agenda. Artificial intelligence is making the job easier. AI allows Russian operatives to mimic an American Southern or Midwestern accent in ways that native Russian speakers would fail to, the ODNI official said. Separately on Tuesday, the Justice Department announced the disruption of nearly a thousand social media accounts that officials said Russia operatives were using to pose as US residents and parrot Kremlin propaganda about the war in Ukraine. Iran, meanwhile, \u201cseeks to stoke social divisions and undermine confidence in the US democratic institutions around the elections,\u201d the ODNI official said at the press briefing. \u201cIran has demonstrated a longstanding interest in exploiting US political and social tensions through a variety of means, including social media.\u201d Iran is attempting to covertly stoke protests in the United States related to the\u00a0conflict in Gaza,\u00a0US\u00a0Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said in a statement on Tuesday. China\u2019s \u2018unwieldy\u2019 foreign influence apparatus Historically, China has shown less interest than Russia in sowing divisions among Americans during US elections, according to intelligence officials. But there have been recent indications that Chinese operatives have become more willing to directly target American voters. Since 2020, senior Chinese officials have issued broad directives to Chinese operatives to \u201cintensify efforts to influence US policy and public opinion in China\u2019s favor,\u201d and senior Chinese officials have aimed to \u201cmagnify US societal divisions,\u201d according to a US intelligence assessment\u00a0declassified\u00a0in December. Those influence efforts have included using fake social media accounts to attack US politicians online. The subject has become a source of tension in US-China relations. Chinese leader Xi Jinping told US President Joe Biden that China would not interfere in the 2024 US presidential election when the\u00a0two men met\u00a0in November, CNN previously reported. But US officials have been skeptical of Xi\u2019s ability to control the vast Chinese bureaucracy when it comes to potential election influence efforts. \u201cEven if Beijing sets limits on its activities \u2026 the PRC\u2019s influence apparatus is very large and at times unwieldy, and individuals that are not under its direct supervision may attempt to influence election activities that they perceive are in line with Beijing\u2019s goals,\u201d the ODNI official said Tuesday, using an acronym for the Chinese government.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/politics/russia-2024-election-influence-operations-intelligence/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_politics_global-elections-roundup", "text": "A year of global elections, in which nations with half the world\u2019s population are casting votes is proving punishing for incumbents struggling with the painful economic aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic and the scandals and exhaustion that afflict leaders who spend years in power. Elections in recent days in France and Britain have shown disgruntled but informed electorates using democracy in novel ways through tactical voting to reshape their countries. In Iran \u2013 even amid the highly restrictive circumstances of an election choreographed by the clerical autocracy, voters sprung a surprise and a hardliner lost. So far, this mass global exercise of political self-determination has done as much to highlight the growing threats to democracy, the rule of law and the rise of populist leaders as to enshrine the principle that people should choose their leaders. In some countries, like El Salvador and Slovakia, leaders and parties with authoritarian instincts have cemented their power through the ballot box. In others, like Russia, they\u2019ve strangled the rights of voters to extend their own rule. And there are rising concerns about how new leaders with strong mandates in nations like Indonesia and Mexico could use their power to centralize authority and erode democratic structures. For leaders seeking reelection this year, there are sobering omens. Incumbency usually means vulnerability \u2014 as a landmark vote in South Africa demonstrated \u2014 and there is widespread angst in developed societies over cost-of-living crises. Populism is having another moment to mirror Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union in 2016, which was quickly followed by Donald Trump\u2019s election victory in the United States. But democracy\u2019s enduring capacity to channel public anger against the power of dominant leaders or to force change has also been on display from India to Senegal. And elections in Taiwan and South Korea proved the dynamism of the idea that free elections can promote stable governance. Voting around the world is leading up to a critical election in the world\u2019s most powerful democracy \u2013 the United States \u2013 in November. President Joe Biden, weakened by a disastrous debate performance that exacerbated voter concern about his age, is warning that a return to power by Trump \u2014 who tried to steal the 2020 election after losing it \u2014 poses an existential threat to the principle of government of the people, by the people and for the people across the globe. Here are some of the most significant election results so far in 2024 that underscore what may turn out to be a pivotal moment for democracy. European Union The far-right made significant gains in elections to the European Parliament in June, though the populist wave fell short of some of the direst predictions of critics who warn that the continent\u2019s democratic heritage could be at risk. Still, the fact that the ultra-conservatives\u00a0did best in European Union powerhouses France and Germany is hugely significant. Despite the shuffled political deck, the center-right European People\u2019s Party remains the biggest single force in pan-EU politics and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is expected to secure another term. France Sweeping gains by the far-right National Rally party of Marine Le Pen in the European elections prompted French President Emmanuel Macron to make a shock call for new legislative elections, as he pleaded with voters to neutralize the growing threat of extremism. The two round French election system once again kept the far-right out of power on Sunday but Macron\u2019s gamble didn\u2019t exactly pay off. A left-wing New Popular Front coalition emerged to foil Le Pen and the elections ended up empowering the far-left, which Macron had previously crushed with his new brand of centrist politics. An era of political turmoil now looms with a hung parliament, a likely shaky coalition and instability ahead of the next presidential election in 2027. Britain Voters last week ended the 14-year-rule of the Conservative Party marked by scandals, the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union and political chaos that included five different prime ministers in eight years. The new Prime Minister Keir Starmer led his Labour Party to a landmark victory but faces a tough task in mending decaying public services with government finances depleted and with the economy hampered by the impact of Brexit. Indonesia Prabowo Subianto, a former army general, won the presidential election in the world\u2019s fourth most populous nation,\u00a0which is home to its largest Muslim population. Subianto is ostensibly a supporter of Indonesia\u2019s vibrant but often fragile democracy where the military still looms as a key power player. But he has been shadowed by accusations of human rights abuses, especially during his military career during the rule of his father-in-law and dictator Suharto. India The world\u2019s largest democracy sprung a surprise that showed the power of \u201cone person, one vote\u201d even in a nation where Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been accused of squelching the freedom of assembly and the press and eroding secular guarantees in the constitution. The Hindu nationalist leader did stay in power,\u00a0but his hopes of capturing an unassailable parliamentary majority crashed. Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party will now have to rely on coalition partners following a weeklong election that will be remembered for a prominent pollster bursting into tears on live television after botching an exit poll\u00a0that\u00a0missed the shock result. Pakistan The power of voters and the limits of democracy were,\u00a0meanwhile,\u00a0on show in neighboring Pakistan in February in a massive protest vote against the military that left allies of imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan with the largest bloc in parliament. But two anti-Khan parties \u2014 the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and the Pakistan People\u2019s Party \u2013 united to keep the former cricket superstar\u2019s affiliates from forming a government. Asif Ali Zardari, the scandal-tainted husband of assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto,\u00a0is now serving as president with an ally as prime minister. Bangladesh Concerns about the erosion of democracy in South Asia were also intensified by the victory of Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in January in an election that the United States warned was not free and fair and that was marred by the arrests of thousands of members of the opposition. Russia There were no surprises in Russia, where President Vladimir\u00a0Putin stage-managed voting to extend his one-man rule until at least 2030. The election was the first since the death of opposition figure Alexey Navalny in a prison colony. And\u00a0those allowed to stand in opposition to Putin were controlled by the Kremlin with credible opposition figures all jailed, exiled or prohibited from running. El Salvador Strongman rule was also enshrined in El Salvador \u2014 through democratic means. President Nayib Bukele,\u00a0the self-proclaimed world\u2019s \u201ccoolest dictator\u201d whose wild popularity as president is based on his purge against gangs, was overwhelmingly reelected. His dominance was boosted when his New Ideas party won a thumping congressional majority. Despite his popularity, critics warn that Bukele is seriously eroding democratic standards in his country. Mexico Similar concerns about democratic institutions are being raised in Mexico after the historic election of the country\u2019s first woman president, Claudia Sheinbaum. The left-wing climate scientist\u00a0and physicist profited from the popularity of her longtime ally, President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. Sheinbaum, who will also be Mexico\u2019s first Jewish president when she is sworn in, has the legislative majority to push through constitutional reforms that critics say will gut independent regulatory agencies, could politicize the judiciary and lead to few checks on executive presidential power. Taiwan The dynamism of democracy in Taiwan was showcased in an election that immediately intensified tensions with China. Lai Ching-te, the previous vice president, secured a historic third consecutive presidential election victory for his Democratic Progressive Party as voters shrugged off warnings by Beijing that their choice could increase the chances\u00a0of\u00a0conflict with a mainland government that insists Taiwan is part of China. South Korea In South Korea in April, voters delivered a stirring demand for change by handing liberal opposition parties a majority in the legislature in a blow to President\u00a0Yoon\u00a0Suk Yeol and his conservatives. The election was shaped by public anger over a cost-of-living crisis and political scandals, including one swirling around the president\u2019s wife. Portugal Incumbents suffered another blow in Portugal in March when the socialist government was ousted by the center-right Democratic Alliance coalition. But the election was most notable for the rise of the radical right-wing party Chega, which\u00a0took nearly a fifth of the vote for its leader Andr\u00e9 Ventura, a former trainee priest and football pundit. Many observers expect a new election soon because of the vulnerability of the minority government. Slovakia There was good news for Putin in Slovakia in April.\u00a0Left-wing nationalist Peter Pellegrini won a presidential election in a boost to pro-Russian Prime Minister Robert Fico, who has sparked concerns over the rule of law and government interference in the media. The result, however, was soon overshadowed by an assassination attempt against Fico, who suffered serious injuries and suggested he was targeted because he broke with the dominant pro-Ukraine position in Europe. South Africa Voters in South Africa also demanded change as the ruling African National Congress \u2014 the party of Nelson Mandela \u2014 lost its majority for the first time in 30 years in the most significant political shift since the ending of apartheid. The rebuke followed years of corruption scandals, economic mismanagement and rising violent crime. The political horse trading following the election produced an alliance that was even more stunning than the result.\u00a0The\u00a0ANC formed an agreement to form a government with its staunchest adversary \u2014 the White-led Democratic Alliance,\u00a0which had been the official opposition to the ANC for years. Senegal Senegal has long been seen as one of Africa\u2019s most stable democracies, but that legacy seemed in doubt following a decision by outgoing President Macky Sall to delay the election, which triggered mass protests. Sall was,\u00a0however,\u00a0overruled by the country\u2019s top court and the presidential election went ahead in March with opposition candidate Bassirou Diomaye Faye winning a majority and becoming, at age 44, the youngest democratically elected president in Africa days after he was released from prison in an amnesty granted by Sall. Iran Iran wasn\u2019t supposed to have a presidential election this year. But the death of President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash forced snap polls that exacerbated a succession drama surrounding the 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei amid public frustration over economic conditions and clerical authoritarianism. Tehran\u2019s religious leaders kept a lid on dissent and approved a slate of mostly hardline candidates. But reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian beat ultraconservative Saeed Jalili,\u00a0amid the lowest turnout since the Islamic Republic was established in 1979. Pezeshkian has favored\u00a0dialogue with Iran\u2019s foes, particularly over its nuclear program, but the US said it did not expect Iran\u2019s posture to the outside world to change since the Ayatollah wields ultimate power.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/politics/global-elections-roundup/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_politics_gender-gap-2024-election-analysis", "text": "Democrats are facing the threat of a gender gap that could imperil the traditional advantage among younger voters that the party has enjoyed for decades and that President Joe Biden likely needs to defeat former President Donald Trump. While Democrats are counting on a big backlash among younger women against the rollback of abortion rights to help propel Biden, a backlash among younger men against changing gender roles could help lift Trump. Both younger men and women are broadly discontented with the economy and Biden\u2019s job performance, polls show. But the anger and frustration over the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning the federal right to abortion provides Biden a powerful tool to expand his support among young women unhappy with him on other fronts, strategists in both parties agree. For many younger women, pollsters say, the loss of abortion rights has become not only a threat in itself, but a symbol of a broader attempt to reverse women\u2019s gains in economic status and pressure them back into more traditional gender roles. Meanwhile, Biden faces a dual challenge with younger men: Not only is abortion less of a motivating issue for them, but there\u2019s evidence that many of them are receptive to the messaging of Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement, with its implicit promise to restore traditional racial and gender hierarchies. In a striking new Pew Research Center national survey, for instance, fully two-fifths of the men younger than 50 who are supporting Trump agreed that women\u2019s gains in society have come at the expense of men. That was not only more than double the share of younger Biden-supporting men who agreed with that sentiment, but considerably larger even than the share of older Trump-supporting men who agreed. All this suggests that while cultural attitudes may help Biden overcome economic discontent among younger women, an amorphous but insistent sense of cultural marginalization may reinforce Trump\u2019s economic inroads among younger men. Researchers say democracies across the Western world are experiencing a widening partisan and ideological gap between younger men and women. In a much discussed article earlier this year, Financial Times columnist John Burn-Murdoch pointed to survey data in a variety of countries showing that young men were far more likely to identify as conservative than young women. \u201cIn countries on every continent, an ideological gap has opened up between young men and women,\u201d he wrote. That gap has widened in the US, too, though the evidence shows that it is growing more because young women are ideologically moving to the left than because young men are moving to the right. Merged annual results from NBC polls conducted by a bipartisan team of Democratic and Republican pollsters document the trends. In 2013, the share of young men aged 18-29 who called themselves conservative very slightly exceeded the share who identified as liberal, while the reverse was true for young women, according to results provided by Public Opinion Strategies, the GOP half of the partnership that conducts the NBC poll. For each gender, though, the balance between conservatives and liberals was nearly even. In their 2023 results, the pollsters found that young men had shifted slightly left, with slightly more now identifying as liberal than conservative. But, over that same 10-year period, young women had sped leftward: In the 2023 results, three times as many of them identified as liberal than as conservative. In 2013, the share of self-identified liberals among young women exceeded the share among young men by 5 percentage points; by 2023, that gap was nearly four times as large. These shifts over time have produced a situation where younger men are still more liberal than older men on most issues, but not nearly as liberal as younger women. The annual youth poll conducted by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University\u2019s John F. Kennedy school offers perhaps the best snapshot on the gender divergence among younger adults. In this year\u2019s survey, young men were 15 points more likely than young women to support building Trump\u2019s border wall, 12 points more likely to say same-sex relationships are morally wrong and 11 points more likely to say Israel\u2019s response to Hamas in Gaza has been justified. Still, in each case, only a minority of younger men endorsed those conservative viewpoints. But while younger men have moved only modestly to the right on most public policy issues, they have more clearly shifted in their willingness to identify with the Republican Party. The latest annual Harvard youth survey found that among young men, Democrats now only have a 3-percentage point advantage in party identification, down from 22 points as recently as 2020. Among women, the Democratic identification edge over that same period grew from 20 to 26 percentage points. (The NBC surveys likewise found the Democratic advantage narrowing among younger men and widening among younger women over recent years, though the changes were not as dramatic as in the Harvard poll.) \u201cThere is not a ton of evidence that young men are more likely to identify as conservatives, but there does seem to be a growing affinity for Republican identity,\u201d said Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American\u00a0Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. That growing receptivity to the GOP could contribute to a wider gender gap among young people than in recent elections. The latest Harvard poll showed that among likely younger voters, Biden led Trump by about 2-to-1 among women, almost exactly his advantage in the Harvard Poll at this point in 2020. But among likely male voters, the survey found that Biden led Trump by just 6 points, a precipitous, and perilous, decline from his 26-point advantage in the 2020 survey at this point. Other respected sources on voting results in 2020, such as the exit polls, found that Biden didn\u2019t win young men that year by as much as Harvard projected, which would mean his decline now is less severe. Still, pollsters in both parties say their own data track the same movement the Harvard poll identifies, with Biden largely holding his lead from 2020 among younger women, but slipping among younger men, including not only White but Black and Latino younger men. The good news for Biden is that younger women turned out at much higher rates than younger men in 2020; in fact, the gap between female and male turnout that year was wider for younger adults than in any other age group, according to analysis of Census Bureau data by William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Metro thinktank. But Biden has so little margin for error in the battleground states that the level of erosion among younger men that he\u2019s experiencing in polls still poses a grave threat to his reelection. In explaining the growing youth gender gap, analysts point to several factors. One is diverging priorities between young men and women. Even more young women in the Harvard youth poll expressed negative views about Biden\u2019s economic record than young men did, but the women were far more likely than the men to cite abortion as a key factor in their vote. \u201cThe difference is young women are voting more on culture and rights, such as abortion, and young men are probably going to be more compelled to vote on economic reasons,\u201d said Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute and author of the forthcoming book, \u201cThe Politics of Gen Z: How the Youngest Voters Will Shape our Democracy.\u201d As with all generations, Trump\u2019s belligerent style also contributes to the widening gender divide. \u201cYounger men admire the strength of Trump, but what younger men think is strong, women think is chaotic, crazy and divisive,\u201d said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, who polled for Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign. Trump also has a significant tactical advantage in that he tends to be portrayed much more positively than Biden on the YouTube channels, podcasts, Reddit threads and TikTok videos that constitute the principal source of information for many young men, noted John Della Volpe, who directs the Harvard youth poll. (In that survey, young men were substantially more likely than young women to say they rely on YouTube as a major source of news.) \u201cThe media ecosystem specifically among young men is [a place] where Joe Biden doesn\u2019t get a break and Trump is stood up as an anti-hero,\u201d said Della Volpe, who is advising a newly formed super PAC trying to boost Biden among young people. Trump has leaned into that advantage by identifying with entertainment that disproportionately draws younger men, like the Ultimate Fighting Championship match he attended as his first public event following his felony conviction in New York. Trump may also be drawing from deeper wells of changing social attitudes. Last week\u2019s Pew finding that two-fifths of younger males backing Trump believe women\u2019s gains have come at men\u2019s expense is only one of many recent poll results suggesting more young men are bristling against the rising demands for gender and racial equity. The new Pew poll, for instance, also found that more than four-fifths of the younger men supporting Trump asserted that all the obstacles blocking women\u2019s advancement in society have been eliminated \u2014 more than double the share of Biden-supporting younger men who agreed. (In this case, older men backing Trump were as likely to endorse that statement as younger ones.) Nearly two-thirds of the younger men supporting Trump also agreed in the poll that \u201csociety is better off if people make marriage and having children a priority\u201d \u2014 equal to the share of older Trump men and more than triple the share of younger Biden men. In an AEI poll this spring, the share of all young men who say efforts to promote gender equity have gone too far reached about 1-in-5, more than double the level in 2017. Survey evidence also shows resistance, particularly among younger White men, to the growing demands from minority groups for more racial equity in education, employment and other settings. In that same AEI poll, over three-fifths of young White women said their race has made their life easier, but far fewer young White men said the same (only about 2-in-5). Conversely, in this year\u2019s Harvard poll, nearly three-fifths of men (of all races) agreed that society is placing too much emphasis on racial identity; only about two-fifths of young women agreed. Exactly three-fourths of younger men supporting Trump in the Pew poll rejected the idea that Whites benefit from advantages in society unavailable to Blacks. This backlash against a changing society only extends so far: Though the \u201ctradwife\u201d movement in social media celebrates women reverting to roles as homemakers and mothers, in the Harvard Poll only about 1-in-6 younger men (and 1-in-10 younger women) agreed that women should prioritize having children over entering the workforce. Deckman noted that compared to older generations, young men today\u00a0\u201chave been raised by their mothers and aunts and grandmothers, who have gone on to hold jobs and be professionals and they are used to seeing women as leaders.\u201d But if young men aren\u2019t moving back to 1950s expectations in large numbers, the surveys showing male unease with women\u2019s increasing independence and authority make clear that something is stirring. \u201cLooking across different surveys and different questions, we can debate about the degree to which it is changing, but there is no doubt we are seeing movement,\u201d said Cox of the AEI. This pushback among young men comes after activism around racial and gender equality in the past few years reached its highest level since the late 1960s and early 1970s, with the rise of the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements and more forceful advocacy in LGBTQ communities. (In the Harvard poll, one-fourth of young women identified in some way as LGBTQ, more than double the share of young men.) It also comes amid continuing evidence that women are navigating the transition to an information-based economy better than men: Women now account for about 60% of all four-year college graduates and nearly 65% of graduate degrees, according to the latest federal statistics. In her upcoming book, Deckman sees the #MeToo movement as the galvanizing force initially propelling more Gen Z women toward liberal activism. That first impulse, she said, has been reinforced by Trump\u2019s 2016 electoral success, despite his extensive history of misogynistic statements and behavior. The sharp turn right on social issues in red states, punctuated by the Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 Dobbs decision overturning the nationwide right to abortion, has provided another spur to activism. Anna Dean, co-founder and co-CEO of the group LOUDwomen, is one of the young female activists Deckman profiles in her book. Dean, now a rising senior at Harvard, helped to start the group in high school in Bentonville, Arkansas, when she noticed that young women and racial minorities were dropping out of school debate activity after biased treatment by the judges. When Trump was elected, she said, the young women felt the same sexist or racist behavior they were fighting in their schools was \u201creflected on the news when we hear Donald Trump speak.\u201d The Dobbs decision, she said, underlined the sense among the young women that their rights were eroding, even as many of them had reached educational milestones unmatched for older women in their families. When relatives or acquaintances tell Dean she is living the \u201cwildest dreams\u201d of earlier generations of women by attending Harvard, she said she often thinks: \u201cOK, yeah this is awesome but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same rights you did when you were my age. I am doing things my ancestors could have only dreamed of, but at the same time I don\u2019t have the same health care rights.\u201d Della Volpe says that from his research and focus groups, he believes that younger men are not so much hostile to the movements demanding more rights for women or LGBTQ people as wondering where that leaves them. \u201cI have empathy for them because in large measure they are just trying to figure life out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they sense and feel, sometimes accurately, sometimes inaccurately, that while they are trying to figure life out that they are being judged by people \u2014 that they are projected to be inferior or bad or ignorant, or worse, racist or homophobic. I think that\u2019s a big part of this.\u201d Such anxieties and grievances about social change have always provided the waters that Trump fishes in. The ability to identify the currents of discontent about change \u2014 cultural, racial or economic \u2014 in each group that he is targeting may be Trump\u2019s greatest skill as a politician. Just as the former president has powerfully appealed to White voters who feel marginalized in a more racially diverse America, or to blue-collar factory towns that feel left behind by the transition to a metro-based information economy, he\u2019s also showing a magnetic pull for the men who feel eclipsed by women\u2019s growing prominence in the workplace and society. Most younger men don\u2019t necessarily hold favorable views about Trump personally, noted Cox, but many are receptive to his broad message that elites in modern US society are discriminating against him and his followers. \u201cThat grievance is what binds them [to him] when very little else does,\u201d Cox said. By contrast, said Deckman, for younger women who believe opportunity and power in US society are still too much tilted toward men, \u201cDonald Trump is the embodiment of many of the things they are opposed to. \u2026 They are sick of old White guys running everything.\u201d That sentiment doesn\u2019t easily translate into enthusiasm for Biden, the other \u201cold White guy\u201d\u00a0in the race. Dean said that despite the distaste for Trump, even young women in her activist circles are more likely to talk about their frustrations with the current president than their fears of the prior one. Given the risk that Biden won\u2019t match his 2020 performance with young men, he has an urgent need to rekindle that flagging enthusiasm among young women. \u201cHe\u2019s got to make up for the defection of young men by winning young women by more, and he\u2019s got to get every young woman he can out to vote,\u201d said Lake, the Democratic pollster. Biden\u2019s best hope of avoiding a catastrophic decline in his youth support is that the number of young women Trump repels exceeds the number of young men he attracts.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/gender-gap-2024-election-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_06_29_politics_voters-trump-biden-debate-2024", "text": "Larry\u00a0Malinconico\u00a0went to bed worried about President Joe Biden\u2019s debate performance.\u00a0He woke up thinking\u00a0he should do something about it. Malinconico is\u00a0an independent\u00a0and a\u00a0college geology professor in Northampton\u00a0County, Pennsylvania, a bellwether area in one of the nation\u2019s most\u00a0competitive presidential battlegrounds. \u201cI\u2019m extremely\u00a0concerned,\u201d Malinconico said just after the\u00a0CNN debate Thursday night. \u201cPresident Biden performed poorly, His voice was weak. He stumbled and had difficulty staying on track with his answers.\u201d Still, he\u00a0cannot fathom the alternative and ended his debate night take with this: \u201cDespite my significant\u00a0concerns about Biden\u2019s\u00a0capabilities,\u00a0I will still vote against Trump.\u201d But early Friday afternoon, Malinconico reached out to add this: \u201cAfter sleeping on the debate overnight \u2026 now I\u2019m much more in favor of supporting moves to have President Biden drop out or for an open (brokered perhaps)\u00a0convention.\u201d It was one of a flood of voter reactions highly\u00a0critical of the president\u2019s debate performance, and one of several suggesting the debate, at least in the short term, damaged the incumbent\u2019s standing with voters\u00a0critical to his reelection\u00a0 hopes. Pat Levin is another\u00a0Northampton\u00a0County resident. The 94-year-old told us when we first met a few months ago that she was not worried about Biden\u2019s age. She is still planning to vote Biden, but her reaction was also quite telling. Levin had nice things to say about Vice President Kamala Harris and\u00a0California Gov. Gavin Newsom, praising their interviews after the debate. \u201cNothing good to say,\u201d though, about Biden \u2013 and the overall substance of the\u00a0CNN Presidential Debate. \u201cBiden whispered, spoke haltingly and appeared exceedingly vulnerable,\u201d Levin, told\u00a0CNN in a text message. \u201cIt was a sad night for American politics.\u201d Michael Pesce, a self-described Reagan Republican who says he\u00a0cannot support Trump, offered a similar take. \u201cLast night was a horror show,\u201d Pesce said Friday. \u201cBiden looked old and doddering and not at all presidential. Trump was angry and bombastic\u00a0and unable to say anything truthful.\u201d Pesce told us in May he would reluctantly vote for Biden because he sees Trump as unfit for the presidency. His morning after debate take was telling \u2013 and, again, troublesome for Biden. \u201cThe Democrats need to have an open\u00a0convention and rally behind a much younger\u00a0candidate,\u201d Pesce said. Pesce, 60, lives in Bucks\u00a0County in the\u00a0Philadelphia\u00a0suburbs, and like Northampton, is a battleground within the battleground. Malinconico, Levin and Pesce are participating in a\u00a0CNN project designed to track the 2024\u00a0campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in the\u00a0 battlegrounds and are part of\u00a0critical voting blocs. There are 60 voters participating so far, across 10 states, and they are diverse in every way. But the overwhelming\u00a0consensus after the debate, from Democrats and Republicans alike, was that Biden\u2019s showing was alarming. \u201cI\u2019m really scared that if Biden stays on the ticket, Trump is going to win,\u201d said Davette Baker, an African American and longtime Democratic\u00a0organizer in Milwaukee. And while strong Trump supporters were happy with his performance, the former president, too, faced some harsh\u00a0criticism from many of our voters, even\u00a0Republicans. \u201cSame old Donald, talked about himself,\u201d said Matt Vrahiotes, a\u00a0Christian\u00a0conservative who owns a small winery in Hall\u00a0County, Georgia. \u201cStroked his ego.\u201d Still,\u00a0Vrahiotes said Trump \u201cseems to be more\u00a0cognitive and mentally sharper.\u201d When we first\u00a0met, Vrahiotes said he would\u00a0consider a third party option, and his after the debate take reflected his\u00a0continued despair at the major party\u00a0choices. \u201cWhy not allow Kennedy on stage,\u201d he said of independent\u00a0candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who failed to meet the\u00a0CNN debate\u00a0criteria. Four big takeaways from our voters: \u2013\u2013 Those already unhappy with their\u00a0choices\u00a0came away from the debate even more sour about a Biden-Trump rematch. \u201cI hate that Trump talks down about America,\u2019\u201d said Antonio Munoz, a veteran who owns a Las Vegas restaurant and\u00a0catering business. \u201cI\u2019m not motivated to vote. Biden\u2019s\u00a0closing was weak.\u201d \u2013\u2013 Younger voters who align with Biden on many issues but feel little\u00a0connection with him because of his age were taken aback by his performance. \u201cI was genuinely shocked,\u201d said\u00a0Christine Ngyuen, 29, a former nurse who recently opened a Boba tea house in the Atlanta suburb of Decatur. \u201cBoth of our\u00a0candidates are far too old to be doing what they are doing,\u201d said Summer Matkin, a student at Wayne State University who lives in the Detroit suburbs. \u2014 Committed Democrats who plan to vote for Biden regardless of his performance still voiced exasperation because the debate reinforced their worries Trump\u00a0could win the election. \u201cIt felt like he let Trump drive a dangerously false narrative and\u00a0could do nothing more than say, \u2018That\u2019s a lie\u2019 without fully establishing the truth strongly,\u201d said Anushka Jalistagi, a recent University of Michigan graduate and former\u00a0co-president of the\u00a0campus\u00a0College\u00a0Democrats. \u2014 Trump supporters approved of his debate performance but there was no evidence in our group that he gained support. \u201cSad. We don\u2019t have the sharpest tacks in the box to vote for,\u201d said Kim\u00a0Cavaliere, a nurse in suburban Atlanta who is undecided and unhappy with her\u00a0choices. \u201cI bet other\u00a0countries are laughing at us. I was.\u201d Ibrahim Ghazal, a Palestinian-American law student from the Detroit area, is angry with Biden over the Hamas-Israel\u00a0conflict and leaning against voting for him again. But he had a dim view of Trump before the debate, and a dimmer one after. \u201cTrump had much better stage presence than Biden,\u201d Ghazal said in a text Friday. \u201cWhat was most disturbing to me was that Trump used the word \u2018Palestinian\u2019 as a slur.\u201d This was Trump during an exchange about the Hamas-Israel\u00a0conflict: \u201cYou should let them go and let them finish the job. He doesn\u2019t want to do it. He has become like a Palestinian. But, they don\u2019t like him because he is a very bad Palestinian. He is a weak one.\u201d Linda Rooney, a registered Republican who lives just\u00a0outside of Philadelphia,\u00a0voted for Biden in 2020 but said this year she would either \u201chold my nose\u201d and vote for Trump or write in a\u00a0conservative. There are 18 weeks left in the\u00a0campaign, but Trump\u2019s debate showing\u00a0did not win a\u00a0commitment from Rooney. \u201cLast night\u2019s debate was a disaster for Biden but what scares me more is that the Republicans\u00a0can\u2019t say they have a good\u00a0candidate either,\u201d she said. \u201cHow did my party get to the point where the only way we may win the presidency again is because we are up against someone who is feeble and not well? \u2026 Republicans should not be taking\u00a0a victory lap.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/politics/voters-trump-biden-debate-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}

Last year, Biden asked Stoltenberg to extend his tenure as NATO secretary general an additional year, citing Russia\u2019s ongoing war in Ukraine. The former Norwegian prime minister has served in the role since 2014. Former Dutch Prime Minister\u00a0Mark Rutte\u00a0was formally selected as the next NATO secretary general in late June and will begin the job on October 1. \u201cI realized \u2013 I was talking to your wife, I personally asked you to extend your service, forgive me, that you put your own plans on hold. When the Russian war in Ukraine began, you didn\u2019t hesitate,\u201d Biden told Stoltenberg Tuesday. \u201cToday, NATO is stronger, smarter, more energized than when you began. A billion people across Europe and North America \u2013 indeed the whole world \u2013 will reap the rewards of your labor for years to come.\u201d Biden, himself a recipient of the medal when he was vice president to Barack Obama, most recently awarded the Medal of Freedom to 19 Americans spanning decades of accomplishments in athletics, politics and civil rights. Biden honored Stoltenberg with the medal at the conclusion of his closely watched speech to open the summit, during which the president announced that NATO would be donating new air defense systems to Ukraine. During his own remarks earlier in the event, Stoltenberg urged members of the alliance to continue their support for Ukraine. \u201cOur alliance was created by people who had lived through two devastating world wars,\u201d Stoltenberg said, \u201cThey knew only too well the horror, the suffering, and the terrible human cost of war.\u201d \u201cRussia\u2019s war against Ukraine is the biggest security crisis in generations,\u201d he said, \u201cUkraine has showed remarkable courage and NATO allies have provided unprecedented support.\u201d \u201cThe reality is there are no cost-free options with an aggressive Russia as a neighbor. There are no risk-free options in a war,\u201d he said, \u201cRemember - the biggest cost and the greatest risk will be if Russia wins in Ukraine. We cannot let that happen.\u201d Biden\u2019s decision to award the honor was not part of the announced program, though the president did appear to accidentally read stage instructions from his prepared remarks. \u201cAsk the military,\u201d Biden said, before correcting himself. \u201cMilitary come forward \u2013 I\u2019ll ask you to read the citation.\u201d Biden is expected to give a solo news conference as part of the NATO summit on Thursday.

{"id": "2024_07_05_politics_fact-check-joe-bidens-abc-interview", "text": "President Joe Biden sat down with ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos for\u00a0a high-stakes interview\u00a0on Friday, the week after a poor debate performance prompted questions about his fitness for the presidency and calls for him to withdraw from the 2024 race. Here is a fact check of some of Biden\u2019s claims in the interview. New York Times polling Biden claimed that \u201cthe New York Times had me down 10 points before the debate, nine now, or whatever the hell it is.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Biden\u2019s claim that he gained a point in New York Times polling after the debate is false. In fact, the Times\u2019 post-debate poll, conducted with Siena College,\u00a0showed Biden doing three points worse\u00a0against former President Donald Trump than he had done in the\u00a0final Times/Siena poll before the debate. Biden\u2019s specific numbers were also wrong. He was not \u201cdown 10 points before the debate\u201d in Times/Siena polling. In fact, he was down three percentage points with likely voters and six percentage points with registered voters. In the Times/Siena poll after the debate, those margins grew to six percentage points with likely voters and nine percentage points with registered voters. Biden did acknowledge his uncertainty about the data when he said \u201cor whatever the hell it is.\u201d But he was wrong, nonetheless. Sen. Mark Warner and the presidency When Stephanopoulos noted a\u00a0Friday report in The Washington Post\u00a0that said Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia is trying to put together a group of fellow Democratic senators to ask Biden to withdraw from the election, Biden responded, \u201cWell, Mark is a good man. We\u2019ve never had that \u2013 he also tried to get the nomination too. Mark\u2019s not \u2013 Mark and I have a different perspective. I respect him.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Biden\u2019s claim that \u201che also tried to get the nomination too\u201d needs context. Warner has never run for the Democratic presidential nomination. He did\u00a0make extensive preparations\u00a0for a possible run for the 2008 nomination, including hiring staff and raising millions for a political action committee, but he\u00a0announced in October 2006\u00a0that he had decided not to launch a campaign after all. And he has not sought the nomination since then. Biden did run in that 2008 presidential primary, which was won by Barack Obama. Trump and bleach Biden repeated his familiar claim that Trump \u201cis a guy who told us to put bleach in our arms to deal with Covid.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0Biden\u2019s claim is misleading. Trump never portrayed his ill-informed and widely denounced musings about using disinfectants to address Covid-19 as advice to Americans. Rather, Trump was talking about the possibility of scientists conducting tests of this idea. Trump made his remarks, at a\u00a0press briefing in April 2020\u00a0after Bill\u00a0Bryan, the acting undersecretary of science and technology for the Department of Homeland Security, outlined tests in which he said sunlight or disinfectants like\u00a0bleach\u00a0and isopropyl alcohol quickly killed the coronavirus on surfaces and in saliva. When Trump jumped shortly afterward to the dangerous idea of injecting disinfectants inside people\u2019s bodies, he said: \u201cAnd is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning, because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it\u2019d be interesting to check that, so that you\u2019re going to have to use medical doctors with, but it sounds interesting to me. So we\u2019ll see.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments were\u00a0slammed by medical experts\u00a0as highly dangerous, and they prompted urgent\u00a0warnings\u00a0from public health authorities and companies that sell household disinfectants. But he never actually said he was suggesting citizens go and use such products. Trump and jobs Biden repeated another one of his regular campaign claims about his Republican opponent, saying Trump was the only president other than Herbert Hoover \u201cwho lost more jobs than he created.\u201d Facts First:\u00a0This is true, but Biden left out some important context. While there was a\u00a0loss of about\u00a02.7\u00a0million\u00a0jobs\u00a0from the beginning of Trump\u2019s four-year term to the end, there was a gain of about 6.7 million jobs until the Covid-19 pandemic hit the country about three years into that term.\u00a0 Nearly 22 million jobs were lost under Trump in March 2020 and April 2020 when the global economy cratered on account of the pandemic. The US then started regaining jobs immediately, adding more than 12 million from May 2020 through December 2020, but not enough to make up the massive early-pandemic losses.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/politics/fact-check-joe-bidens-abc-interview/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_07_09_politics_mark-rutte-next-nato-leader", "text": "As the NATO alliance prepares to celebrate its 75th anniversary at this week\u2019s summit in Washington, it is also gearing up to welcome its first new leader in a decade: a man\u00a0experienced at dealing with former President Donald Trump\u00a0that many hope can keep the alliance unified in the face of a swirl of challenges\u00a0including a potential second Trump presidency. Former Dutch Prime Minister\u00a0Mark Rutte was formally selected as the next NATO secretary general in late June and will begin the job on October 1. He takes up the role from longtime NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg, who has led the alliance since 2014. Diplomats and officials who spoke with CNN said Rutte is seen as a staunch trans-Atlanticist and a consensus builder. \u201cHe is really a seasoned political official, and this is essential to keep the cohesion of the alliance,\u201d a European official said. Rutte is also seen as someone who\u00a0can work with whoever is elected US president, officials told CNN, and some hope that Rutte\u2019s past relationship with Trump,\u00a0from when they led their respective countries,\u00a0could deter the former president from undermining the alliance if he is reelected. The former president publicly railed against the alliance during his first term in office and did so again recently on the campaign trail, even going as far as suggesting Russia \u201cdo whatever the hell they want\u201d to members who don\u2019t meet defense spending targets. Trump\u2019s stance on the campaign trail that his adherence to the alliance would be conditional has stirred concerns in the international community. \u201cTrump likes people that will push back, especially if they do it in a very respectful way,\u201d said Pete Hoekstra, Trump\u2019s ambassador to the Netherlands. In a meeting where Trump was talking about the \u201ctrade deficit,\u201d Hoekstra recalled, Rutte pushed back, \u201cwith a smile on his face,\u201d that they did indeed need to address the trade deficit between the US and the Netherlands. \u201cIt was just a very polite, slightly humorous way of dealing Trump, and Trump appreciated it,\u201d Hoekstra recalled to CNN. \u201cThere was no, \u2018You S.O.B.\u2019 or anything like that. It was just, \u2018Touche, Rutte, you got me.\u2019\u201d Still, just because the former\u00a0president and Rutte \u201chave a good working relationship \u2026 because they genuinely like each other,\u201d it does not mean that Trump will be deterred from \u201chis agenda,\u201d Hoekstra said. The former ambassador argued that \u201cTrump was never against NATO,\u201d but rather \u201cwas against a NATO that the Europeans didn\u2019t support,\u201d referencing the fact that many European countries at the time did not contribute 2% of their GDP to defense. \u2018Not a superhero\u2019 A European diplomat told CNN that Rutte is \u201ccertainly not a superhero,\u201d noting that \u201cone may try to please Trump but not fool him, so ultimately what matters with NATO is real action and most importantly real money.\u201d A senior NATO official said that \u201ca lot of allies are concerned\u201d about the prospect of a Trump reelection, \u201cbut the story is positive.\u201d Twenty-four out of 32 allies are meeting the 2% spending target; six are spending above 3%. \u201cWe are not there yet, but it is better than when Trump left,\u201d the official told CNN. Rutte was not only cheered for the NATO secretary general job because of his experience with Trump. He was seen as someone who could get the support of all 32 members of the alliance, striking a balance between the more hawkish eastern Europe and more frugal western Europe, in part because of his more \u201cmiddle ground\u201d position on the war in Ukraine. NATO member states will look to him to maintain the unity of alliance as the war drags on \u2013 with little sign of a quick diplomatic or military victory for Kyiv \u2013 as well on issues like countering the threat from China, ramping up weapons production, and innovation on cyber. Diplomats and officials who spoke with CNN pointed to Rutte\u2019s tenure as the longest-serving prime minister of the Netherlands \u2013 a job he left in early July after 14 years. \u201cHe has had to manage various coalition governments in parliamentary democracy in his country, which is certainly no easy task,\u201d a US official said. A former senior US diplomat described him as a \u201cvery good politician (who) understands building coalitions and consensus, which is what this is going to all be about.\u201d Rutte was broadly considered as the front-runner to succeed Stoltenberg this year, and he was quickly supported by the US. According to the US official, President Joe Biden even encouraged Rutte to run for secretary general about a year and half ago, when Stoltenberg was ready to step down, but Rutte signaled that he was not interested at that time. Biden likes Rutte personally, they get along well, and the US president sees them as sharing the same values, the official told CNN. The two view the challenge from China in a similar way, and Biden was \u201cvery impressed with his commitment to supporting Ukraine from early on\u201d and his immediate grasp of the stakes of the war in Ukraine. \u201cRutte has been very realistic among European leaders for a long time about who exactly Putin is,\u201d the official said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/politics/mark-rutte-next-nato-leader/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_politics_joe-biden-critical-day", "text": "After President Joe Biden\u2019s reelection efforts spiraled into chaos following his debate fiasco last month, Democrats who have both stood by and abandoned Biden since then see Tuesday as a decisive day for the president\u2019s political future. Numerous Democrats inside Biden\u2019s administration and others close to the White House and campaign have told CNN over the past few days that the conclusions drawn within a morning House Democratic caucus meeting \u2013 followed by a Senate Democrats\u2019 gathering in the afternoon \u2013 will likely seal the president\u2019s fate. While Biden has said the \u201cLord almighty\u201d alone could drive him to abandon his campaign, top Democrats have said the decision ultimately lies with party leadership, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. \u201cChuck and Hakeem are going to have to say, \u2018The Congress is turning on you,\u2019\u201d one top Democrat told CNN on the only scenario that could convince Biden to abandon his candidacy. \u201cThat\u2019s basically the bottom line.\u201d Schumer and Jeffries both publicly backed Biden on Monday after the president launched an offensive across airwaves, campaign calls and congressional caucus meetings to shore up support. But both leaders will face their entire caucuses, which have seen support erode from senior members of committees. The degree of that erosion could force Democrats\u2019 hand to decide one way or another - especially once Democrats begin to worry that appearing on a ballot under Biden harms their own election chances. Jeffries listened as he was confronted with concerns and frustrations from all factions of the caucus during House Democrats\u2019 Tuesday meeting.  The open mic format, during which roughly 30 lawmakers spoke, was designed so Jeffries and his leadership team could hear directly from members during the group\u2019s first in-person meeting since the presidential debate. But instead of a united front, Democrats emerged from the meeting without consensus or a clear path forward. While Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn, a staunch Biden ally, called the meeting \u201cvery positive,\u201d another Democratic member in the meeting told CNN that there was a sense of \u201csadness\u201d in the room from \u201ctalking about someone you love who is in obvious decline.\u201d Democrat Rep. Lloyd\u00a0Doggett, the first sitting House Democrat to call on Biden to withdraw his candidacy, said that he expects more Democrats to join his ranks following the caucus meeting, the opposite of what most party leaders were hoping for. \u201cThe debate cannot be unseen. The president has been running behind. We needed a surge. We got a setback. He is a great man who\u2019s made a great contribution to the country, but he shouldn\u2019t leave a legacy that endangers us that we surrender to a tyrant,\u201d Doggett said, referring to former President Donald Trump. Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton, another one of the six House Democrats to publicly call for Biden to step aside, said he shared how he got to his position in the closed-door meeting with his colleagues. \u201cEveryone was listening very carefully to a variety of positions in the room. And that\u2019s exactly the kind of debate and discussion that we should be having as a party. This is what democracy is about,\u201d Moulton said. Even though a number of lawmakers expressed their support for Biden, the concerns stuck with many Democrats after the meeting. \u201cThere\u2019s a ton of concern,\u201d Democratic Rep. Greg Landman told CNN. \u201c(Biden\u2019s) got a lot of work left to do.\u201d The first fractures in what had been Biden\u2019s coalition of Democratic support appeared last Tuesday, five days after his faltering debate performance, when Doggett of Texas became the first member of Biden\u2019s own party in Congress to ask that he step aside. He has since been joined by several more members of Congress \u2013 all in the House \u2013 though the most prominent members have either firmly entrenched themselves behind their candidate or avoided questions about whether he should continue. Several Democratic governors who attended a meeting with Biden at the White House last week left unimpressed with Biden\u2019s shifting explanations for his poor debate performance and his vows to take\u00a0steps,\u00a0including limiting late-night events and going to sleep earlier,\u00a0to avoid a repeat of that performance. One governor, Maura Healey of Massachusetts, said Biden should \u201ccarefully evaluate\u201d whether he\u2019s the best choice to defeat Trump. Party officials tell CNN that a decision must happen soon, otherwise Biden\u2019s candidacy could be irreparably damaged by the intra-party war that has broken out and the reputational damage Biden has sustained as a result. \u201cI can\u2019t stress this enough: Dems need to make a decision and then move forward,\u201d one DNC official said. \u201cThe sniping won\u2019t stop until leadership officially puts an end to the uncertainty.\u201d That time crunch is part of what makes this week one of the most crucial of Biden\u2019s half-century-long political career. House Democrats gathered on Tuesday to discuss steps forward with Biden\u2019s campaign. Biden will join a group of Democratic mayors for a meeting later Tuesday, and will participate in a rare solo news conference during the NATO summit later this week. With the Democrats\u2019 August convention quickly approaching, the party has little time to mount an entirely separate national political campaign in Biden\u2019s absence - while the president has precious few opportunities to convince voters, donors and members of his own party that he is up to another grueling three months of campaigning followed by another four years in office. The interview Biden did with ABC last week confirmed Biden\u2019s stubborn determination to prove his doubters wrong and stay in the race - even if it didn\u2019t soothe concerns about his ability to do so. He riffed extensively on polling data and,\u00a0when\u00a0asked whether he would consider stepping aside if crucial party leaders asked him to do so, replied: \u201cThey\u2019re not going to do that.\u201d Another senior Democrat put the message more bluntly: Leaders in both chambers, they said, need to tell their members Tuesday to \u201cf\u2013king get in line.\u201d Most within the party understand the frustration that has emerged after Biden\u2019s debate performance resurfaced questions about his health and longevity that even former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi described as \u201clegitimate.\u201d But there remains a significant amount of skepticism that Biden could be replaced seamlessly on the ticket without more hand-wringing and a lot of red tape. \u201cThe fantasy that we could swap in a person, and they could run away with a nomination at the convention, is just that \u2013 a fantasy,\u201d another senior Democrat said. \u201cAnd the chattering in the interim isn\u2019t helping.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reporting.

{"id": "2024_07_08_politics_trump-tax-cuts-tcja-wealthy-benefit", "text": "The highest-income households would receive more than 45% of the benefits if the expiring provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are extended, according to an analysis released Monday by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. The tax cut law was a key accomplishment of former President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, but the individual and certain business tax provisions are set to expire at the end of next year. Trump has promised to extend them if he is returned to the White House in November\u2019s election. If the law\u2019s provisions are made permanent, households making at least around $450,000 \u2013 roughly the top 5% \u2013 would be the biggest winners, the analysis found. They would see their after-tax income increase by 3.2%. For those in the top 1%, who make at least $1 million, that equates to a tax cut of about $70,000, on average, in 2027. The top 0.1%, who make at least $5 million, would pocket a tax cut of nearly $280,000, on average, or about 3% of their after-tax income. Middle-income households earning between roughly $65,000 and $116,000, on the other hand, would receive a tax cut of about $1,000, or 1.3% of their income. Overall, extending the 2017 tax law would reduce taxes for about three-quarters of households, but hike them for about 10%, according to the analysis. Big debate expected Addressing the expiring provisions will be a contentious issue in Congress next year. Trump and many Republican lawmakers want to extend the tax cuts, saying they have helped spur economic growth. But President Joe Biden and many congressional Democrats have said they would allow the measures benefitting those earning more than $400,000 to lapse, arguing that the law disproportionately helped the rich. \u201cThere is much we still need to learn about how the candidates would address the looming expiration of many key provisions of the TCJA,\u201d Harold Gleckman, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, wrote in a post. \u201cBut one thing is clear: While extending the law as is would benefit most taxpayers, the biggest winners would be those making $450,000 or more.\u201d Complicating matters is that extending the provisions would have a big impact on the national debt, raising it by more than $4 trillion over the next 10 years \u2013 before interest costs are factored in, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The TCJA contained a bevy of individual income and corporate tax reductions, making it one of the largest tax cut packages in US history. Unlike the individual tax provisions, most of the corporate measures are permanent. Some of the key provisions that expire at the end of 2025 include: the reduction of individual income tax rates, notably the top rate of 37%, down from 39.6%; the near doubling of the standard deduction; the doubling of the annual child tax credit to $2,000 and allowing more higher-income parents to claim it, and the essential doubling of the estate and gift tax exemption. In addition, the law temporarily created a special deduction for the owners of certain pass-through entities who pay their business taxes on their individual tax returns. The deduction, which also expires at the end of 2025, allows these taxpayers to exclude up to 20% of their business income from their federal income tax. These so-called pass-through businesses include partnerships, such as those formed by lawyers, doctors or investors.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/politics/trump-tax-cuts-tcja-wealthy-benefit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_politics_how-did-we-get-here-with-biden-your-questions-answered-what-matters", "text": "President Joe Biden is rejecting any idea that he would step aside as the Democratic nominee, a decision that is his alone. When we asked readers what questions they have about Biden, they expressed some confusion about the process that made him the presumptive Democratic nominee. Here are answers to some of the questions posed to CNN from readers: No. There was a series of primaries in states and territories this year and voters in those contests overwhelmingly backed Biden. He faced only token opposition from a little-known congressman, Rep. Dean Phillips, and an author, Marianne Williamson. Biden won nearly all of the 3,949 pledged delegates who will officially select the party\u2019s nominee at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August. Delegates pick the nominee during a roll-call vote. While party rules don\u2019t formally require delegates to vote for the candidate to whom they\u2019re pledged, they\u2019re supposed to, and campaigns have the right to approve the delegates pledged to their candidates. Biden has the votes to win the nomination in that first round of voting and realistically, it\u2019s highly unlikely that another candidate could be elected without Biden voluntarily stepping aside. This is an unprecedented situation. Primaries began in January and went on for months. That monthslong process provided Democrats and independents who wanted to take part in the Democratic primary the opportunity to back a different candidate. Each one of those primaries, arguably, was a sort of off-ramp. But Democrats at the time were largely rallying behind Biden. That was, however, before his poor debate performance fed festering concerns about his age. It is remarkable that even though polling has long suggested voters feel Biden is too old and would have preferred a different choice, high quality opponents did not challenge him. Phillips and Williamson never gained traction and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. left the Democratic Party to run as an independent rather than challenge Biden for the party nomination. The party also worked hard to discourage opposition to Biden. It did not sponsor debates, and multiple states, including Delaware and Florida, did not hold Democratic primaries after it was clear that Biden had the delegates to win the nomination. Delegates are supposed to honor the voters in their states. Here\u2019s the language in the Democratic party rules for the 2024 convention: \u201cAll delegates to the National Convention pledged to a presidential candidate shall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.\u201d Primaries are an important part of the process and primary voters chose Biden. Not that they had much choice; the party worked hard to unify early behind Biden and discouraged serious opposition. But delegates technically pick the party nominee, which is why it would probably take Biden releasing the delegates he won to replace him on the ticket. We received several versions of this question, not all of them fit to print. The large universe of people who believe Trump is unfit to be president have thought that for a long time. There is a universe of people who are newly questioning Biden\u2019s fitness after the debate. I would point out that figure \u2013 that Trump lied more than 30 times at the debate \u2013 is directly reported in CNN\u2019s Fact Check of the debate. From that report: Trump\u2019s repeat falsehoods included his assertions that some Democratic-led states\u00a0allow babies to be executed after birth, that\u00a0every legal scholar and everybody in general wanted Roe v. Wade overturned, that there were\u00a0no terror attacks during his presidency, that\u00a0Iran didn\u2019t fund terror groups during his presidency,\u00a0that\u00a0the US has provided more aid to Ukraine than Europe has, that\u00a0Biden for years referred to Black people as \u201csuper predators,\u201d that Biden is\u00a0planning to quadruple people\u2019s taxes, that\u00a0then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi turned down 10,000 National Guard troops for the US Capitol on January 6, 2021,\u00a0that Americans don\u2019t pay the cost of his tariffs on China and other countries, that\u00a0Europe accepts no American cars, that\u00a0he is the president who got the Veterans Choice program through Congress, and\u00a0that fraud marred the results of the 2020 election. So I believe it is inaccurate to say the media is giving Trump a pass. Trump, for his part, has all but disappeared from the campaign trail since the debate and Biden is holding events, doing TV and audio interviews and more as he engages in damage control. There has also been ample coverage of Trump\u2019s criminal trial, his many other legal troubles, and his often outrageous claims and policy proposals. Biden argues he has the best chance of winning and says the pollsters he talks to say the race is a tossup. High-quality public polling since the debate, on the other hand, suggests Trump does have a lead. In hypothetical matchups in which other Democrats are put up against Trump, the results are not currently much different. If those numbers start to change dramatically, pressure on Biden to drop out will increase dramatically. When I put this question to CNN\u2019s polling director, Jennifer Agiesta, she cautioned that polling is frequently misinterpreted as a tool to predict the future. It does not tell us who has a better chance of winning, but the state of the race in a particular moment. \u201cEven before the debate there was almost no polling showing Biden with a significant lead of Trump nationally or in key states,\u201d Agiesta said. \u201cIn a two-way matchup between Trump and Biden, there hasn\u2019t been a high-quality poll showing a significant Biden lead since February.\u201d Biden says he does not have a debilitating cognitive condition so it does not appear he is hiding one. His advisers argue that he maintains a full campaign and governing schedule and he frequently appears in public, although his advisers have clearly tried to minimize unscripted moments. Impeachment is utilized to punish \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d according to the US Constitution. Republican efforts to impeach Biden, which have so far failed, have focused not on his age, but on his son\u2019s former business interests. The 25th Amendment provides a pathway to dislodge an incapacitated president, but it is a complicated process and would require a majority of Biden\u2019s Cabinet and Vice President Kamala Harris to agree in writing that he is \u201cunable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.\u201d None of his allies are currently saying that about him. But if, in the future, a majority of his Cabinet and Harris (or some other body appointed by Congress) turned on Biden and tried to declare him incapacitated, he could dispute their finding and resume his duties. Harris and the Cabinet would then have four days in which to double down on their declaration that the president was unfit, at which point both houses of Congress would have 21 days to decide in a vote if he should carry on as president. It would require two-thirds of the Senate (usually 67 of 100 senators) and two-thirds of the House (usually 290 of 435 representatives) to remove the president from office. Democrats have not exactly turned on Biden. Only a handful of elected Democrats have publicly argued he should step down as the party\u2019s candidate in 2024. But they are almost universally worried that Trump will beat Biden in a rematch. Not only do Democrats disagree with the former president\u2019s policies, they also view him as a destabilizing threat to American democracy. If Biden is not viewed as capable by the few independent voters who might support either candidate, it makes a Trump election more likely. This would get very complicated, as CNN\u2019s David Wright has written: It\u2019s a significant war chest that\u00a0totaled $240 million at the end of June, including the Democratic National Convention and allied committees, according to an announcement from Biden\u2019s campaign on Tuesday. At the end of May, Biden\u2019s campaign account alone held $91.6 million, according to the most recent available data from the Federal Election Commission (FEC). If Harris\u00a0were\u00a0tapped as a replacement nominee, she would take over the existing campaign account, and have control of funds deposited there, per FEC rules. If the race were thrown open,\u00a0the Biden-Harris campaign could\u00a0transfer all of\u00a0its\u00a0cash on hand\u00a0to the Democratic National Committee, as\u00a0FEC rules\u00a0permit unlimited transfers from candidate committees to national party committees. The DNC could use those funds in several ways to support a new nominee, and could distribute that money to a variety of other down ballot candidates and allied committees \u2013 but in doing so, the DNC would be limited by FEC rules governing spending and contributions\u00a0for national party committees. There are other options, each with its own set of drawbacks, according to Wright, including turning Biden\u2019s campaign account into a PAC.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/politics/how-did-we-get-here-with-biden-your-questions-answered-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_politics_nikki-haley-delegates-presidential-convention", "text": "Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said Tuesday that she is releasing her delegates to the Republican National Convention and urging them to support former President Donald Trump. \u201cThe nominating convention is a time for Republican unity. Joe Biden is not competent to serve a second term and Kamala Harris would be a disaster for America,\u201d Haley said in a statement. \u201cWe need a president who will hold our enemies to account, secure our border, cut our debt, and get our economy back on track. I encourage my delegates to support Donald Trump next week in Milwaukee.\u201d The move, which was first reported by Politico, comes after Haley made clear in a May speech that she would vote for Trump, despite their acrimonious differences that cropped up during the Republican presidential primary. Neither Haley nor Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who were among Trump\u2019s biggest rivals in the Republican primary, are set to address the party\u2019s convention next week. DeSantis intends to attend the Republican gathering, aides said, while Haley does not. \u201cShe was not invited, and she\u2019s fine with that,\u201d Haley spokeswoman Chaney Denton told CNN. \u201cTrump deserves the convention he wants.\u00a0She\u2019s made it clear she\u2019s voting for him and wishes him the best.\u201d Haley earned 95 delegates during the Republican primary process, according to CNN\u2019s delegate estimate. But due to state party rules, delegate estimates don\u2019t always translate directly to how the party activists may vote during the convention roll call. For Haley, the decision to release her delegates was all but a formality, but one that also marked a closing chapter of her quest to win the Republican presidential nomination. She emerged as the last standing rival to the former president, bowing out of the race in March before finally declaring in May: \u201cI will be voting for Trump.\u201d Haley, who served as US ambassador to the United Nations in the Trump administration, grew emboldened to speak more forcefully against her former boss as her campaign moved along. But she ultimately concluded that Trump, who she said \u201chas not been perfect,\u201d would be a far better choice than Biden. Speaking at the conservative Hudson Institute in Washington in May, Haley urged the former president to not ignore her supporters. \u201cTrump would be smart to reach out to the millions of people who voted for me and continue to support me, and not assume that they\u2019re just going to be with him,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I genuinely hope he does that.\u201d While Trump has not extended an olive branch to Haley or her supporters, the Biden campaign has closely studied the Republican primary results, aides said, even in deep-red states such as Indiana, where Haley received\u00a0about 22% of the vote. The Biden campaign\u00a0has sought to reach Haley\u2019s supporters\u00a0through television and digital ads in hopes of reminding them of Trump\u2019s insults aimed at their candidate. It\u2019s an open question how many of those voters who backed Haley during the primary were lodging a temporary protest against Trump or actually open to supporting Biden. Haley and Trump have spoken once since she dropped out of the race, aides said, having a brief conversation in June. While their bitter feud has dissipated, aides said, the decision not to invite Haley to Milwaukee underscored how Trump was intent on making the convention a showcase on him, rather than allowing former rivals to step into the spotlight. It\u2019s a notable change from 2016, when Trump accepted the party\u2019s nomination for president the first time. The two Republicans who received the second- and third-most delegates in that campaign, Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, both addressed the party\u2019s convention. Trump also previously closed the door to selecting Haley as his running mate, declaring in May that she was \u201cnot under consideration,\u201d but adding that he wished her well.

A review of the Sentinel program was conducted after the Air Force said in January its costs were exceeding baseline projections. The review found that the cost of the program is estimated to be $140.9 billion \u2014\u00a0an 81% increase from the cost estimate made in September 2020. The Sentinel program is a massive effort to replace the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile system,\u00a0which was introduced in\u00a0the 1970s,\u00a0with\u00a0Sentinel\u00a0intercontinental ballistic missiles.\u00a0According\u00a0to\u00a0Air Force Global Strike Command, the Sentinel\u00a0will extend the\u00a0US\u2019\u00a0land-based\u00a0nuclear\u00a0capabilities \u201cthrough 2075.\u201d \u201cThere are reasons for this cost growth, but there are also no excuses,\u201d Dr. Bill LaPlante, the under secretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, said on Monday. \u201cWe fully appreciate the magnitude of the cost, but we also understand the risks of not modernizing our nuclear forces, and of not addressing the very real threats we confront.\u201d As a result of the cost\u00a0increase, LaPlante said he has directed the Air Force to restructure the program and\u00a0put\u00a0an \u201cappropriate management structure\u201d in place to control costs \u2014\u00a0which will delay it by \u201cseveral years.\u201d He also rescinded approval for it to enter the engineering and manufacturing development phase. Typically, if\u00a0the costs of a\u00a0program increase\u00a0by\u00a025% or more,\u00a0it\u00a0has to\u00a0be terminated unless the\u00a0under secretary\u00a0of defense for acquisition and sustainment \u201ccertifies to Congress that the program meets established criteria to continue,\u201d a news release on Monday said. LaPlante told reporters on Monday he was doing exactly that.\u00a0He said the modernization program is \u201cessential to national security,\u201d\u00a0and is\u00a0higher priority than programs whose funding\u00a0will\u00a0need to be cut to accommodate\u00a0the rising costs\u00a0with\u00a0\u201cno alternatives\u201d that would match the\u00a0Sentinel\u00a0program\u2019s capabilities for a lower price. LaPlante attributed the inaccuracy of the original cost estimate to insufficient knowledge on a piece of the program. Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force Gen. Jim\u00a0Slife\u00a0added Monday that\u00a0decisions on of what funding trade-offs the Air Force will need to make\u00a0in order to\u00a0fund Sentinel won\u2019t need to be decided for another few years.

{"id": "2024_07_06_politics_joe-biden-drop-out-precedent-what-matters", "text": "It is not unprecedented for an incumbent president to abandon his reelection campaign. But it is rare, and no president has been pressured out of a reelection campaign out of concerns about his mental fitness. One warning bell for Democrats who assume that a nominee younger than President Joe Biden would do better against former President Donald Trump: Republicans won the two most recent elections in which presidents eligible for reelection bowed out of their campaigns. Democrats Harry S. Truman and Lyndon B. Johnson were succeeded by Republicans. A more immediate problem for Democrats is that if Biden were to drop out now \u2013 something he has so far shown no sign of doing \u2013 it would be the latest such decision in history. Johnson and Truman left under pressure, handed the White House over to the other party Comparisons between Biden and any of these presidents are not perfect. Neither Truman nor Johnson faced serious questions about their ability to do the job. Biden does. Both Johnson and Truman, like Biden, were former lawmakers and former vice presidents. Unlike Biden, both had assumed the presidency after a death or assassination. Both Johnson and Truman then won the White House in their own right. But both Johnson and Truman faced competition for their party\u2019s nomination in 1952 and 1968 respectively. Both were embarrassed by a subpar showing in the New Hampshire primary, and both announced in the spring that they would not seek reelection. Truman made the announcement that he would not be running during a speech in Washington that was broadcast nationwide, while Johnson made his announcement in a televised address from the White House. Biden was never under any real pressure from Democrats to stand down earlier this year, and he faced only token opposition for the Democratic nomination. Nearly all of the delegates to the Democratic National Convention are pledged to him. In other words, Truman and Johnson both avoided a bruising primary by ending their reelection campaigns. Biden still has Democratic nomination sewn up, and he would have to choose to give it up. Republicans, with help from their war hero nominee Dwight Eisenhower, won the White House, the Senate and the House in 1952, when Truman decided not to run again. Johnson\u2019s decision not to run created a scramble for the Democratic nomination. Ultimately, Vice President Hubert Humphrey won the honor at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Humphrey would go on to lose the White House to Richard Nixon, but Democrats kept control of the House and the Senate. Roosevelt and Coolidge left on high notes, and their party kept the White House Theodore Roosevelt and Calvin Coolidge were Republicans who assumed the presidency after an assassination or death, and both chose to leave the presidency after serving one full term and most of another. Roosevelt later regretted his pledge not to run again in 1908. He left office extremely popular and well respected and handed the White House off to his hand-picked successor, fellow Republican William Howard Taft. But Roosevelt was so aggravated by Taft\u2019s performance and the direction of the GOP that he challenged Taft for the Republican nomination in the next presidential election.\ufeff When Roosevelt could not get the nomination at the GOP convention, he ran as a third-party Progressive, or Bull Moose, candidate and beat Taft at the ballot box, although both lost to Democrat Woodrow Wilson. Coolidge assumed the presidency when Warren G. Harding died of a heart attack in San Francisco. Coolidge then won the White House on his own. Never happy as president, he suffered loss during his time in office when his son died tragically after playing tennis at the White House. Coolidge also handed the presidency off to a fellow Republican, Herbert Hoover. Coolidge disclosed his decision not to run on handwritten\u00a0strips of paper\u00a0given to reporters during his summer vacation the year before the election.\u00a0The curt statement \u2013 \u201cI do not choose to run for President in 1928\u201d \u2013 caught everyone by surprise. Three 19th-century presidents pledged to serve one term Despite an active and successful presidency, James K. Polk\u2019s Democrats lost the White House after he stepped aside from the 1848 election. The Whig Party ran a war hero, Zachary Taylor, and former President Martin Van Buren ran as a third-party candidate. Taylor won, taking the White House from the Democrats. James Buchanan promised in his inaugural address in 1857 that he would not run again. He said: Buchanan, who was in office when Southern states protested Abraham Lincoln\u2019s 1860 election victory by seceding, does not live in grateful memory of many historians. He\u2019s viewed as one of the worst American presidents. Democrats lost control of the White House and the Senate in 1860, and Lincoln became the first Republican president. Rutherford B. Hayes, a Republican, promised to serve one term and did so after the disputed 1876 presidential election, by which a compromise handed Hayes the White House but also essentially ended Reconstruction. Reforming the civil service was a major issue of the day, and it played into Hayes\u2019 decision, according to his letter accepting the Republican nomination in 1876. Republicans picked James Garfield at their 1880 convention to succeed Hayes, and Garfield not only won the White House but his party gained control of both the House and the Senate. For Democrats today, holding on to at least one lever of power in Washington is a major priority as they fret over a possible second Trump term.

{"id": "2024_07_09_politics_intelligence-russian-sabotage-threat-us-bases-europe", "text": "US military bases across Europe were placed on a heightened state of alert last week for the first time in a decade after the US received intelligence that Russian-backed\u00a0actors were\u00a0considering carrying out\u00a0sabotage attacks against US military personnel and facilities, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN. The intelligence the US received suggested that Russia had included US bases and military personnel as options to attack via proxies, the sources said\u00a0\u2014\u00a0similar to plots that have been carried out or disrupted across Europe in recent months. In April, two German-Russian nationals\u00a0were arrested\u00a0for allegedly plotting bomb and arson attacks on targets including US military facilities on behalf of Russia. The intelligence, which the US received within the last two weeks and has not been previously reported, was deemed alarming enough to implement additional safety protocols, the sources said.\u00a0Several US military bases in Europe raised their alert level to Force Protection Condition \u201cCharlie,\u201d which \u201capplies when an incident occurs or intelligence is received indicating some form of terrorist action or targeting against personnel or facilities is likely,\u201d according to the US Army. A senior NATO official said on Tuesday that the alliance had \u201csignificantly increased\u201d its intelligence sharing around \u201cRussia\u2019s\u00a0campaign of covert sabotage activities\u201d in Europe, which\u00a0have become increasingly brazen and aggressive in recent months\u00a0amid\u00a0elections across the\u00a0West\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a \u201cprime opportunity\u201d for Russia to try to undermine public support for Ukraine, the official said US European Command declined to comment directly on what caused the force protection change last week. But a spokesperson,\u00a0Cmdr.\u00a0Dan Day, said that \u201cour\u00a0increase in vigilance is not related to any one single threat, but due to a combination of factors potentially impacting the safety and security of US forces in the European theater.\u201d The threat of Russia-backed sabotage efforts has become particularly acute in recent months, amid a series of arson attacks and bombing plots across Europe\u2014including fires and explosions in\u00a0Riga, Latvia; London; Warsaw, Poland; Prague, the Czech Republic; and Paris \u2014 that European security officials\u00a0have linked to\u00a0Russia. In London in March, several men were charged with working with Russian intelligence services to set fire to a Ukrainian-linked warehouse. Poland is investigating whether an arson attack that destroyed Warsaw\u2019s largest mall in May was connected to Russia and has arrested nine people in connection with Russia-linked acts of sabotage, the prime minister said in May. And\u00a0French authorities last month\u00a0detained a Russian-Ukrainian man who was allegedly building bombs as part of a sabotage campaign orchestrated by Moscow. By outsourcing the attacks to local actors, Russia likely believes it can wage a\u00a0hybrid war that falls below the threshold of armed, state-on-state conflict, officials say. But a senior NATO official said the sabotage campaign is getting increasingly brazen and aggressive. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is a more concerted, more aggressive effort, than what we\u2019ve seen certainly since the Cold War,\u201d the official said on Tuesday.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re seeing sabotage, assassination plots, arson \u2014 real things that have cost human lives.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_07_08_politics_wisconsin-voters-biden-debate", "text": "Lisa Reissmann had to stop watching. \u201cHe didn\u2019t seem as strong as what he has been in the past,\u201d she said of President Joe Biden\u2019s performance last month at the CNN debate. \u201cI was really having a hard time watching it. Because he did seem a little off.\u201d Her husband, fellow Biden voter Troy Reissmann, hung in to the debate\u2019s end, reaching for the phone during former President Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0closing statement. \u201cYeah, it was definitely scary,\u201d Troy Reissmann said of Biden\u2019s performance. \u201cThe first people that I\u00a0called were my parents, who are really old. And I said, \u2018What did you guys think about that?\u2019 Because I still know where I\u2019m going to vote, where my vote is going to lie. But\u00a0they don\u2019t. And they were equally as scared.\u201d The Reissmanns own the Shinery, a moonshine bar in\u00a0Cedarburg, a small, picturesque\u00a0city about 30 minutes north of Milwaukee. What were once textile mills are now bars, restaurants, inns and art galleries.\u00a0Local after local talks about living in a real-life Hallmark movie or a Norman Rockwell painting. The Reissmanns \u2014 civil, affable and politically minded \u2014 have a message for the candidate they both supported in 2020. \u201cThink of the future. Think of our kids and grandkids,\u201d Troy Reissmann said. \u201cMaybe you should step aside only because there\u2019s \u2014 the future doesn\u2019t look too bright with the other side taking\u00a0over. And maybe I\u2019m wrong, and I hope I would be, but you know, it\u2019s scary.\u201d Lisa Reissmann agreed. \u201cI think it is time. We just need fresh leadership, new leadership. \u2026 I like Joe Biden as a person, you know. I think he stands for good things. But I am just not sure he\u2019s there anymore to lead the\u00a0country.\u201d The Reissmanns \u2014 and\u00a0Cedarburg \u2014 are now part of a\u00a0CNN project designed to track the 2024\u00a0campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds and are part of\u00a0critical voting blocs. Cedarburg, population 12,000, would not have made such a list until recently. It was once reliably Republican. Mitt Romney won 63% of the vote here just a dozen years ago, in 2012. Trump won in 2016, but his share of the vote dropped to 55%. Then Biden eked out a 19-vote win in\u00a0Cedarburg in 2020 \u2014 a\u00a0combination, locals say, of population shifts and Trump\u2019s suburban struggles with moderate Republicans and GOP-leaning independents. Gina\u00a0Cilento fits, though perhaps not perfectly, in the latter group. \u201cI\u00a0can\u2019t say right now,\u201d\u00a0Cilento said when asked her 2024 presidential preference. \u201cI\u2019m undecided.\u201d Biden\u2019s debate debacle hasn\u2019t automatically translated into more support for Trump, at least in Cedarburg. Cilento tends to vote Republican and has never voted for a Democrat for president. But she is disgusted with today\u2019s politics and\u00a0calls herself \u201cleaning more independent or straight up libertarianism.\u201d \u201cMy politics are\u00a0currently very \u2014 a place of being kind of over it,\u201d\u00a0Cilento said in an interview at her growing\u00a0Cedarburg pickleball studio. \u201cEvery time you go to the polls \u2014 this is the best our\u00a0country\u00a0can do? \u2026 We are one of the greatest\u00a0countries in the whole entire world and this is what we\u2019re \u2014 these are our deliverables? It\u2019s very frustrating. \u2026 I just feel overall sadness, and to me the biggest issue is that a house divided\u00a0cannot stand. And there\u2019s truth to that and I\u2019m seeing our\u00a0country erode instead of thrive.\u201d We find dismay and disgust at the presidential\u00a0choices everywhere we travel. Worries about political polarization \u2014 \u201ca house divided\u201d as\u00a0Cilento put it \u2014 were common among Americans who have a history of voting Republican but a hard time voting for Trump because of a tone they find abrasive and antagonistic. To that end,\u00a0Cilento said she \u201cwould entertain\u201d voting third-party. She\u00a0cannot imagine voting for Biden and said she was saddened by his debate performance.\u00a0She said she would at least take a look at a new Democrat if Biden stepped aside. \u201cI\u2019m in a place where I\u2019m wanting to feel\u00a0connected,\u201d she said. Cilento \u2014 a former tennis pro turned\u00a0competitive, touring pickleball player \u2014 sees voters of all stripes at her facility. But political\u00a0conversations there tend to be brief and polite. \u201cIt is really just a place for people to forget what is going on in the real world, and they\u00a0can focus on just having fun and getting along,\u201d\u00a0she said. Cilento was the grand marshal of this year\u2019s Fourth of July parade in\u00a0Cedarburg, an event \u2014 once featured in a Toby Keith music video \u2014 that is a source of enormous local pride. During the parade, which runs for about two hours, the sidewalks are packed with families as marching bands, antique tractors, and floats sponsored by local businesses wind past stone and shingled buildings with rich histories. \u201cThe\u00a0city itself was really powered by textile mills,\u201d said Melissa Wraalstad, who runs the Wisconsin Museum of Quilts and Fiber Arts, which is located on a\u00a0Cedarburg farmstead once owned by German immigrants. \u201cMid-20th century into the 1970s, the mills\u00a0closed. So\u00a0Cedarburg had to reinvent itself and\u00a0come up with another idea,\u201d Wraalstad said in an interview. \u201cA lot of other towns faltered (but)\u00a0Cedarburg was able to reinvent itself as an arts destination and a tourist town.\u201d Wraalstad noticed another\u00a0change to Cedarburg in 2020, when, for the first time, the lawn signs were roughly evenly split between the Democratic\u00a0and Republican\u00a0candidates.\u00a0Her favorite? A neighboring house where the husband and wife split the lawn \u2014 half Trump; half Biden. Everyone says there are fewer signs this year. Maybe it is just early. Or maybe it\u2019s a reflection of what Wraalstad heard a lot from museum visitors and friends after the debate. \u201cPeople weren\u2019t thrilled with either of them, for the most part,\u201d she said. And the review of Biden\u2019s debate? \u201cThe same\u00a0concerns people all over the\u00a0country have about age,\u201d said Wraalstad, who said she was an independent\u00a0who\u00a0could not discuss her personal opinions because of her museum role. The lack of enthusiasm for both major-party\u00a0candidates was also evident at a giant post-parade picnic\u00a0at a local park. There were a modest number of Trump hats and shirts; some, but fewer, signs of Biden branding.\u00a0Conversations with a half-dozen Democrats were dominated by their worries about Biden\u2019s debate performance and their view it had damaged his\u00a0chances of winning Wisconsin again. (The president narrowly carried the state in 2020 after Trump won it four years earlier.) Allen Naparalla tracks the political\u00a0change here by the dwindling number of eye rolls and\u00a0complaints about the slogan of his\u00a0Chiselled Grape Winery right along\u00a0Cedarburg\u2019s main drag: \u201cSexy Wines \u2013 Taste the Juice.\u201d Five years ago, he said, when he opened the shop, he had \u201csome issues with people.\u201dPeople said things like \u201c\u2018what is that?\u2019\u201d and \u201c\u2018that\u2019s disgusting,\u2019\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cNow you are kind of getting on an even keel between\u00a0conservative and liberal.\u201d Naparalla moved here to\u00a0care for his aging mother. His wines are made and bottled in\u00a0California and sold in a welcoming\u00a0caf\u00e9 where locals mingle with tourists. In a\u00a0campaign year like this, politics are a frequent topic\u00a0of\u00a0conversation. \u201cI make it a safe environment,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cEveryone has a right to speak. Everyone has a right to say what they feel.\u201d He\u00a0calls himself a fiscal\u00a0conservative and social liberal, someone who thinks Washington should spend less money but ban assault-style rifles. \u201cI\u2019m having a horrible, difficult time,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u00a0constant fighting and bickering. \u2026 It\u2019s the middle\u00a0class that is not being represented anymore. The actual worker. The small businessman.\u201d In one breath, he says he is undecided when it\u00a0comes to the 2024 presidential election. In the next, he says he\u00a0can\u2019t vote for Trump and doesn\u2019t see a viable third-party option. Naparalla, too, watched the debate. \u201cHorrible. I mean it was awful,\u201d Naparalla said. \u201cWatching Biden try to get through his words was just bad. Just bad. Now everyone has a bad day. I get it. But the thing is, this was a time \u2014 this was your time to shine, you know?\u201d Did Biden look\u00a0capable of serving four and a half more years? \u201cI don\u2019t, I think that what\u2019s \u2026\u201d said Naparalla \u2014 not often at a loss for words \u2014 as he stumbled a bit trying to settle on his answer. \u201cLet me put it this way: I\u2019m voting for the party right now.\u201d This sentiment from Naparalla\u00a0came up a lot in our\u00a0Cedarburg\u00a0conversations: \u201cBefore the debate, I thought Biden\u00a0could still pull it out.\u201d Now, Naparalla and many\u00a0certain or likely Biden voters here voice doubts that the president\u00a0can\u00a0carry Wisconsin and win reelection. And they fear a Trump return to the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be probably a hairy time for a while,\u201d Naparalla said. Yet he is not\u00a0convinced switching\u00a0candidates is the answer. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said when asked whether he believed Vice President Kamala Harris is qualified to be president. He spends a lot of time in\u00a0California and said he does not think Gov. Gavin Newsom should be the nominee, either. Naparalla understands why some people are\u00a0calling for Biden to step aside. But he is skeptical. \u201cWho\u2019s going to do it?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s so late in the election process that, you know, Trump will be a shoo-in anyway. \u2026 I just think it is too late.\u201d Naparalla was not the only voter we spoke to in\u00a0Cedarburg to pose this challenge to Biden\u2019s team and top Democrats: \u201cIf you\u2019re really\u00a0concerned about your party, then do something before this. You know what I mean?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/politics/wisconsin-voters-biden-debate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_politics_us-pier-gaza-to-be-removed", "text": "The US military pier off the coast of Gaza is set to be permanently removed as soon as next week, according to four US officials, after it is reconnected one more time to deliver any remaining humanitarian aid in Cyprus and on the floating dock several miles offshore. The $230 million temporary pier operation, which has been plagued with problems since its inception, has been at the Israeli port of Ashdod for nearly two weeks because\u00a0the Pentagon decided\u00a0sea\u00a0conditions were too rough for it to operate. Last month marked the third time that the pier has been disconnected from Gaza because of inclement weather. Pentagon\u00a0press secretary\u00a0Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said at a press briefing on Tuesday that the plan was to \u201ctentatively\u201d reattach the pier sometime \u201cthis week,\u201d which will \u201cenable the delivery of additional aid into Gaza.\u201d Officials said the pier could be reconnected for the last time as soon as Wednesday. But once the remaining aid is delivered, the pier is expected to be removed from the coast of Gaza and the operation, which began in mid-May, will end, officials said. Since the pier began operations, more than 19.4 million pounds of humanitarian aid have been delivered via the pier to the collection area in Gaza. Its removal will mark the end of a highly anticipated, but deeply troubled effort to flow humanitarian aid to the population of Gaza. The US began building the\u00a0floating pier\u00a0in late April with the help of some 1,000 US soldiers and sailors. US officials have emphasized that the pier was only meant to be a temporary measure aimed at supplementing land routes from Israel and Egypt into Gaza, which are often closed or gridlocked because of extensive Israeli inspections. The Associated Press first reported the plans to permanently remove the pier. Officials had anticipated that the US military would operate the pier for about three months from the time it became operational in mid-May, but heavy sea states routinely disrupted the pier\u2019s operations, and distribution of the aid once it reached Gaza proved challenging and dangerous for aid workers. Aid delivered to Gaza via the pier piled up on the beach for several weeks last month as the World Food Programme evaluated whether it was safe to distribute inside the enclave.\u00a0The Israel Defense Forces had early on agreed to provide a wide security perimeter around the\u00a0pier system and the aid operation, but an Israeli hostage rescue operation very nearby the pier in early June raised additional security concerns for aid workers. The aid distribution restarted late last month, after millions of pounds of aid \u2014 roughly 6,000 pallets worth\u00a0\u2014\u00a0had accumulated on the Gaza shoreline, CNN previously reported. The Pentagon and USAID\u00a0inspectors general\u00a0have\u00a0launched coordinated reviews\u00a0of the pier operation, they announced last month.\u00a0The review comes as some congressional Republicans have railed against the troubled pier as a \u201cwaste of taxpayer dollars\u201d that \u201cdefies all logic.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/politics/us-pier-gaza-to-be-removed/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_politics_lbj-biden-what-matters", "text": "President Joe Biden, who is dogged by questions about his acuity, has privately acknowledged that the next few days are a critical test of his reelection campaign, according to CNN\u2019s latest report. He remains publicly defiant and insists he will remain in the race. But he would not be the first president to step aside rather than seek reelection if he ultimately makes that decision. Most recently, in 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson shocked the country when he made the surprise announcement that he would not run at the end of an Oval Office speech on his plan to limit US military operations in Vietnam. Here\u2019s part of that address: It is a remarkable speech to watch today. Nearly 60 years old when he made that speech, Johnson looked much older. He would die of a sudden heart attack in 1973 at 64, before eligibility for retirement programs like Medicare, which he signed into law, and Social Security, which he expanded. By the time he bowed out of the race, Johnson, unlike Biden, was facing multiple challenges for the Democratic nomination in the spring of 1968. Racial strife in the US, paired with a country fractured over the war in Vietnam, hurt Johnson\u2019s popularity. In early 1968, the Tet offensive in Vietnam showed Communist forces there to be must stronger than the US military had claimed, and American casualties in the war mounted. Earlier that March, Johnson only narrowly won the New Hampshire primary against the anti-war candidate Sen. Eugene McCarthy. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, the brother of the man whose assassination elevated Johnson to the White House, entered the presidential race on March 16. Health was a concern for LBJ Vietnam split the party in 1968, but the growing rift among Democrats over the war was not the only reason Johnson pulled out of the race, according to Mark Updegrove, a presidential historian and CEO of the LBJ Foundation. I talked to Updegrove in 2022 about why presidents might not run for reelection, and he told me at the time that Biden, like LBJ, should consider his health before seeking another four-year White House term. \u201cThere\u2019s the misconception that LBJ opted not to run again due solely to the growing controversy and divisions over the war in Vietnam. That may have been part of it, but his principal concern was his health,\u201d Updegrove said. \u201cHe had had a nearly fatal heart attack in 1955, and his family had a history of fatal heart disease. He didn\u2019t want to put the country through the kind of crisis we had gone through with the sudden death of FDR in 1945, and Woodrow Wilson\u2019s stroke in 1919, which left him incapacitated,\u201d Updegrove added. A year of incredible uncertainty 1968 is an infamous year in US history, and Johnson\u2019s March 31 announcement kicked off a period of violence and uncertainty. Less than a week after Johnson announced his decision not to run for reelection, Martin Luther King Jr. was shot by a sniper on April 4, an event that sparked a wave of violence and riots that devastated many American cities, including Washington, DC, Baltimore and Chicago. Johnson deployed 58,000 National Guardsmen and Army troops to US cities. In June of that year, Kennedy was assassinated in California, creating even more turmoil. His son is now running for president as an independent. If Biden decides to step aside this year, Democrats should study what happened in 1968, when they ultimately sidestepped McCarthy, who channeled the anti-war sentiment. Instead, they elevated Johnson\u2019s vice president, Hubert Humphrey, as their nominee at the Democratic National Convention \u2013 which, like it will be this summer, was held in Chicago that year too. As Humphrey accepted the nomination in the convention hall, riots raged in the streets outside. In November, Humphrey ran close to Richard Nixon, a Republican and the ultimate winner, but the independent candidate George Wallace, a former Democrat, won multiple Southern states with a populist and segregationist appeal. Wallace also likely siphoned votes away from Humphrey in key states. Johnson remains one of the country\u2019s most transformative presidents Johnson capitalized on a period of unity after the death of John F. Kennedy to pass landmark civil rights legislation. He won his own landslide reelection in 1964 and used that momentum to enact a series of laws meant to build the US into a \u201cgreat society,\u201d including Medicare and the Voting Rights Act, and declared a war on poverty. Those civil rights achievements were not universally celebrated in the US, and they hastened a realignment of the American political parties in which his Democrats went from the dominant to the minority party in the American South.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/politics/lbj-biden-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_politics_joe-biden-house-democrats", "text": "President Joe Biden told congressional Democrats in a letter on Monday that he will continue his reelection bid despite mounting concerns about his mental fitness and the viability of his campaign, while also hitting back at party \u201celites\u201d in an interview ahead of a critical week on Capitol Hill. \u201cI want you to know that despite all the speculation in the press and elsewhere, I am firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump,\u201d Biden wrote in the letter, obtained by CNN. Biden sought to put growing concerns about his viability to rest in the forcefully worded letter. \u201cThe question of how to move forward has been well-aired for over a week now. And it\u2019s time for it to end. We have one job. And that is to beat Donald Trump. We have 42 days to the Democratic Convention and 119 days to the general election. Any weakening of resolve or lack of clarity about the task ahead only helps Trump and hurts us,\u201d Biden concluded. \u201cIt is time to come together, move forward as a unified party, and defeat Donald Trump.\u201d It\u2019s a critical week for Biden\u2019s political future as he seeks to tamp down intensifying fallout with the House and Senate back in session for the first time since the debate. More than a handful of top House Democrats told Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Sunday that Biden needs to step aside amid concerns about down-ballot Democratic races. Shortly after the letter was released, Biden called into MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d part of a strategy to do more \u201coff-the-cuff,\u201d unscripted engagements to quell concerns about his age. But the appearance, while energetic, may not have had its intended impact. Biden offered a lengthy and occasionally off-topic response to a question about his letter to Hill Democrats calling for unity and lambasted Trump for being on the golf course after the debate. Trump has largely stayed under the radar while Biden battles the news cycle. \u201cWell look \u2014 Democrats \u2014 Joe, let me say it this way, the reason I\u2019ve been on the road so much, all over the country, while Trump is riding around in a golf cart, filling out his golf cart before, golf cart before he even hits the ball \u2014 but anyway, he hasn\u2019t been anywhere in 10 days, I\u2019ve been all over the country, No. 1,\u201d he said. He continued: \u201cAnd I\u2019ve gone over the country for several reasons, one, to make sure my instinct was right about the party still wanting me to be the nominee. And all the data, all the data shows that the average Democrat out there who voted, 14 million of them who\u2019ve voted for me, still want me to be the nominee, No. 1.\u201d And in a pointed rebuke to his critics, Biden said, \u201cI\u2019m getting so frustrated by the elites. Now, I\u2019m not talking about you guys, but by the elites in the party. They know so much more. But if any of these guys don\u2019t think I should run, run against me. Go ahead. Announce \u2014 announce for president. Challenge me at the convention.\u201d Critical week ahead on Capitol Hill The president will continue his outreach to Democratic lawmakers this week, a campaign official tells CNN. Tuesday will be a consequential day as members are set hold a planned caucus meeting with Jeffries, and one member told CNN they anticipate that is the day when the dam will break. Two sources told CNN that the meeting, the first time Democrats are gathering as a caucus since the June 27 debate, will be limited to members only and phones are not expected to be permitted inside. Biden will meet virtually with the Congressional Black Caucus Monday night, two sources told CNN. The CBC is arguably the president\u2019s strongest group of support on Capitol Hill and is a key group for him heading into Tuesday\u2019s Democratic caucus meeting. NBC News was first to report on the meeting with the CBC. In the week following his disastrous debate performance, Biden personally reached out to roughly 20 House Democrats, a campaign official tells CNN, and has spoken with party leaders \u2014 including Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Reps. Nancy Pelosi and James Clyburn \u2014 with a goal of reassuring them that the concerns within the party are being heard. Since then, Jeffries, Schumer and Clyburn have voiced support for Biden. Despite divisions in his caucus about Biden\u2019s viability in November, Jeffries insisted on Monday that he is still behind the president. \u201cYes, I made clear the day after the debate, publicly, that I support President Joe Biden and the Democratic ticket,\u201d Jeffries told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju when asked about Biden. \u201cMy position has not changed.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m for Joe,\u201d Schumer told reporters when he arrived at the Capitol Monday and was asked if he supports the president continuing his race for reelection. He would not answer if he has any questions about Biden\u2019s mental and physical ability to lead the nation for four more years. Pelosi has said the questions surrounding Biden\u2019s disastrous performance at the presidential debate were \u201clegitimate.\u201d Asked about Pelosi\u2019s comments, Biden told ABC News, \u201cit was a bad episode. No indication of any serious condition. I was exhausted.\u201d Several House Democrats have already publicly called for Biden to drop out of the presidential race, with Washington state Rep. Adam Smith becoming the latest to do so Monday afternoon. \u201cWell, look, I think he should step aside,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cThe Lead.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s become clear that he\u2019s not the best person to carry the Democratic message. And here\u2019s the thing: We have an incredibly strong message and record to run on. And all respect to the president, he\u2019s done a great job.\u201d But Smith added: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a good message. The president has shown he is not capable of delivering that message in an effective way.\u201d On a call with senior House Democrats convened Sunday by Jeffries, Smith was one of a half-dozen lawmakers who voiced their own concerns during a conversation one aide described to CNN as \u201cpretty brutal.\u201d Those lawmakers \u2014 which CNN has reported to include Reps. Smith, Jerry Nadler, Mark Takano and Joe Morelle \u2014 represent the highest-ranking Democrats on the Armed Services, Judiciary, Veterans Affairs and House Administration committees. A campaign official declined to say whether the president had spoken directly with Sen. Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat who organized a concurrent effort among like-minded senators to explore the possibility of an official request for Biden to step aside. Warner canceled a follow-up meeting scheduled for Monday evening, a source tells CNN, after news of the group\u2019s efforts leaked. The next meeting will be Tuesday with Senate Democrats and their leadership. Biden told ABC News that Warner was a \u201cgood man\u201d but has a \u201cdifferent perspective.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign on Monday highlighted a list of supportive statements from Hill Democrats, seeking to amplify the voices who have expressed confidence in the president\u2019s candidacy in recent days. Biden team hosted another top donor call Also on Monday, the Biden campaign hosted a donor call with its national finance committee, another sign of outreach. A top concern of the campaign is whether donors will continue to back Biden or redirect their money to House and Senate campaign efforts if he stays in the race. Biden said he is not exiting the race and that he believes he\u2019s still the best candidate to beat Trump, three participants told CNN. \u201cMy one job is to beat Donald Trump,\u201d Biden said, according to one of the participants on the call, who said Biden thanked donors and renewed his pledge to keep the fight alive. A second participant said of the president\u2019s determination to continue running: \u201cHe ain\u2019t budging an inch.\u201d Campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon lead the call, which had more than 300 participants, and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore offered a fiery defense of the president, the participants told CNN. Moore was among the governors who met with Biden at the White House last week, telling reporters after the meeting he supports the president but acknowledged the concerns from voters. During the question-and-answer portion of the call, Biden fielded a question from a donor about what he needs to do in the second debate \u2014 currently scheduled for September 10 \u2014 to perform better than the first debate, where 51 million Americans watched his meandering and low-energy performance. Biden, dressed in a suit and flanked by an American flag and family photographs, outlined the strategy simply, two participants said: \u201cAttack, attack, attack.\u201d DNC Finance Chair Chris Korge, who was among the final speakers on the call, was \u201cbegging us to stay in line,\u201d one of the participants said. Biden struck a defiant note on a call with donors, emphasizing that the party needs to shift the narrative back to Trump and the important issues at stake in November. There was a fair amount of discussion, according to one donor on the call, on \u201cProject 2025.\u201d Biden made clear how damaging Trump\u2019s agenda would be across the board, including for the economy, women and the LGBTQ community, one donor said. Biden also smiled on screen when one donor said she would crawl through glass for him. Another participant on the call, who has been critical of Biden and his campaign over the past week, praised the president\u2019s words on Monday and said the campaign seemed to \u201cfinally\u201d grasp the seriousness of the moment. The ultimate test, this donor said, would be whether congressional leaders urge Biden to reconsider this week and whether the battleground map showed any signs of expanding or if the president\u2019s support eroded in campaign polling this week following the long July 4 holiday weekend. \u201cIt\u2019s still a huge hole to climb out of,\u201d the Democratic donor said, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid alienating the campaign. \u201cIt was already a steep hill to climb to victory.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments and reporting.

{"id": "2024_06_28_politics_fact-check-donald-trump-sea-levels-climate-change", "text": "The day after their CNN presidential debate, former President Donald Trump cited a wildly inaccurate figure about sea levels to mock President Joe Biden\u2019s debate\u00a0claim that\u00a0\u201cthe only existential threat to humanity is climate change.\u201d Trump\u00a0said\u00a0at a Friday rally in Virginia that \u201cglobal warming is fine,\u201d rejecting the view of the overwhelming majority of scientists. And he said of Biden: \u201cHe said it again last night, that global warming is an existential threat. And I say that the thing that\u2019s an existential threat is not global warming, where the ocean will rise \u2013 maybe, it may go down, also \u2013 but it may rise one eighth of an inch in the next 497 years, they say. One eighth.\u201d He added what appeared to be a joke: \u201cWhich gives you a little bit more waterfront property if you\u2019re lucky\u00a0enough though.\u201d Facts\u00a0First:\u00a0Trump\u2019s\u00a0claim about the expected pace of\u00a0sea level\u00a0rise is\u00a0not even close to correct. The global average\u00a0sea level\u00a0is\u00a0currently risi\ufeffng\u00a0more\u00a0per year\u00a0than Trump claimed that people\u00a0say it will rise \u201cin the next 497 years.\u201d NASA\u00a0reported\u00a0in March that the current global average\u00a0sea level\u00a0rise in 2023 was 0.17 inches\u00a0per year, more than double the rate in 1993. And a World Meteorological Organization\u00a0report this\u00a0year\u00a0said the rate of\u00a0sea level\u00a0rise between 2014 and 2023 was\u00a0about 0.19 inches\u00a0per year. In other words,\u00a0sea level\u00a0rise is\u00a0already more than an eighth of an inch annually \u2013 and it is\u00a0accelerating. NASA\u00a0found\u00a0a jump of 0.3 inches\u00a0between 2022 and 2023. Gary Griggs, a University of California,\u00a0Santa Cruz professor of earth and planetary\u00a0sciences\u00a0who\u00a0studies\u00a0sea level\u00a0rise,\u00a0said\u00a0last year that Trump\u2019s\u00a0similar claims\u00a0\u201ccan only be described as\u00a0totally out of touch with reality\u201d and that Trump \u201chas\u00a0no idea what he is\u00a0talking about.\u201d Sea levels\u00a0rise by different amounts\u00a0in\u00a0different locations. For the US,\u00a0sea levels\u00a0are\u00a0expected to rise particularly fast\u00a0for the east coast and Gulf of Mexico coast \u2013 and Trump\u2019s\u00a0state of Florida, which is\u00a0bordered by both of those coasts, is\u00a0expected to be\u00a0affected more\u00a0severely\u00a0than many other coastal\u00a0states. In fact, Trump\u2019s\u00a0claims\u00a0about\u00a0sea levels\u00a0are highly inaccurate for the area near Mar-a-Lago, which is\u00a0on the Atlantic. Griggs\u00a0noted in a June email that\u00a0data\u00a0from the closest National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration tide gauge to Mar-a-Lago\u00a0shows\u00a0an increase of an eighth of an inch\u00a0roughly\u00a0every\u00a0nine months. Trump has\u00a0made similar claims\u00a0since his last presidential campaign - sometimes saying the estimate is an eighth of an inch increase over 200, 250, 300 or 400 years. Trump has also\u00a0previously\u00a0made the joke about rising seas creating more waterfront property.\u00a0In reality, rising sea levels are expected to have devastating consequences not only for many seafront properties but for areas further inland \u2013\u00a0rendering some communities uninhabitable\u00a0and others more dangerous, increasing the frequency and reach of\u00a0flooding, making hurricanes\u00a0more destructive, and damaging\u00a0infrastructure\u00a0and ecosystems.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/politics/fact-check-donald-trump-sea-levels-climate-change/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_politics_russian-bot-farm-propaganda-justice-department", "text": "The US Justice Department said Tuesday\u00a0that it\u00a0seized two internet domains and searched nearly 1,000 social media accounts that Russian operatives allegedly used to pose as US residents to spread disinformation in the US and abroad. The so-called bot farm used artificial intelligence to create fake social media profiles purporting to be people in the US and used those phony accounts to post support for Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, according to the Justice Department. The elaborate scheme was organized by an employee of RT, the Russian state-owned media outlet, financed by the Kremlin, and aided an officer of Russia\u2019s FSB intelligence, the Justice Department alleged. The news comes as US intelligence officials are on heightened alert for efforts by Russia or other foreign powers to meddle in the 2024 election. US\u00a0officials are watching closely to see whether\u00a0the\u00a0United States\u2019 support for Ukraine\u00a0will lead the Russian government\u00a0to take more risks\u00a0in potentially interfering in the 2024 presidential election,\u00a0FBI officials\u00a0previously\u00a0said. European countries have also been on high alert for a flood of Russian influence operations as the Kremlin tries to splinter support for Ukraine\u2019s defense. Russian propagandists have\u00a0ramped up\u00a0efforts to denigrate the Paris Olympics this month, including through a fake documentary that uses AI to impersonate the actor Tom Cruise, according to Microsoft. CNN has requested comment on the Justice Department announcement from the Russian Embassy in Washington, DC, the Kremlin, the FSB and RT. X voluntarily suspended the bot accounts identified in court documents, the Justice Department said.\u00a0CNN has requested comment from X. It wasn\u2019t just the FBI that helped expose the alleged bot farm. US Cyber Command, the military\u2019s offensive and defensive cyber unit, was involved, as were Dutch and Canadian security agencies. The bot farm also targeted Poland, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Ukraine and Israel, according to an\u00a0advisory\u00a0released Tuesday by US, Dutch and Canadian authorities. Long a mouthpiece for the Russian government, RT has seen some of its influence in the US wane in recent years as social media platforms have\u00a0taken steps to block access to its output. But the outlet has looked for new ways to reach audiences, including, the Justice Department alleges, through an army of fake X accounts. According to an affidavit from an FBI agent, RT leadership signed off on a proposal from an employee to use software to create a bot farm that \u201cin theory\u201d would \u201ccreate multiple social media accounts through which RT \u2026 could distribute information on a wide-scale basis.\u201d The scheme kicked into gear when Russian operatives bought one of two domain names in 2022 from an Arizona-based company, Namecheap, that were used to set up the bot farm, according to court documents. The RT employee, an FSB officer and others had access to the bot farm, which included X accounts that purported to be interested in cryptocurrency, according to the Justice Department. In one case, a fake account purporting to be based in Minneapolis posted a video of Russian President Vladimir Putin claiming that parts of Poland, Ukraine and Lithuania were a \u201cgift\u201d from Russian forces that freed them from Nazi control during World War II, the Justice Department said. In another case, a fake account replied to an unnamed US politician running for federal office with a video of Putin trying to justify Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, the department said. The Justice Department \u201cwill not tolerate Russian government actors and their agents deploying AI to sow disinformation and fuel division among Americans,\u201d\u00a0Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a statement.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/politics/russian-bot-farm-propaganda-justice-department/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_politics_angry-creditors-giuliani-assets", "text": "A group of angry creditors will face-off against Rudy Giuliani in bankruptcy court on Wednesday, where they have asked a judge to put his finances under the control of an independent trustee in order to lock down his assets and begin to collect what they\u2019re owed. Since declaring bankruptcy late last year, Giuliani appears to have remained flush with cash, including being paid $75,000 by a documentary project. He\u2019s also continued to spend thousands of dollars each month on dozens of Amazon, streaming media and other purchases, according to court records. Those transactions and a general lack of transparency around Giuliani\u2019s finances have drawn the ire and frustration of creditors seeking to enforce millions of dollars in claims against the former New York mayor, including $148 million in damages won by two Atlanta election workers who successfully argued in court last year that Giuliani defamed them after the 2020 election. At Wednesday\u2019s hearing, the creditors will push the judge presiding over the case to take drastic steps to rein in Giuliani\u2019s spending and potentially liquidate his assets, according to court filings they\u2019ve made this week. And Giuliani may have to answer detailed questions under oath about his financial situation that he has so far refused to reveal. The hearing comes\u00a0about a week after Giuliani lost his law license over his efforts in backing Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn the\u00a02020 presidential election. Giuliani is also facing criminal charges in connection to those efforts in Georgia and Arizona. Giuliani\u2019s decision to file for Chapter 11 reorganization should have brought transparency to his finances and moved him toward a plan to pay his debts, bankruptcy experts say. Instead, Giuliani has provided only snippets or inaccurate\u00a0portraits of his financial records, some of which were provided late. He has even surprised his own lawyers with new\u00a0sources\u00a0of income, such as a recent deal he signed to promote coffee. He has also managed to keep control of two condominiums worth millions in New York and Palm Beach, Florida, though he has been trying to sell the New York three-bedroom property. \u201cHe\u2019s using [bankruptcy] as a delay tactic, not being forthcoming with the process, and just sort of ducking and weaving his way in and out,\u201d said Daniel Gielchinsky, a bankruptcy attorney based in Florida who is closely following the case. \u201cIt\u2019s a real story from a fall from grace. It\u2019s somewhat shocking, but it\u2019s also sad.\u201d \u2018Bankruptcy process as a joke\u2019 Giuliani\u2019s creditors \u2013 including Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, the two Georgia election workers whom he owes $148 million for defaming them after the 2020 election \u2013 are furious with how the bankruptcy has failed to progress to begin to make them whole\u00a0more than six months since he declared bankruptcy. \u201cSince day one, Giuliani has regarded this case and the bankruptcy process as a joke, hiding behind the fa\u00e7ade of an elderly, doddering man who cannot even remember the address for his second multimillion dollar home and claims impending homelessness if he must sell that second multimillion dollar home,\u201d wrote lawyers from the law firm Akin Gump, which represents a committee of Giuliani\u2019s creditors in the bankruptcy proceeding. \u201cIn reality, Giuliani has treated this Court, the bankruptcy process and the Committee \u2026 with utter disrespect and without accountability. Giuliani is playing the delay game.\u201d Lawyers watching the case say that if Giuliani were to be assigned a Chapter 11 trustee by the judge Wednesday, that attorney could immediately move to sell his homes, so his creditors can collect, and take control of\u00a0his companies like Giuliani Communications LLC, which court records say has received thousands of dollars in nominally explained wire transfers in recent months Giuliani\u2019s tactics In response, Giuliani\u00a0has asked the bankruptcy judge to change the classification of his bankruptcy, from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7, which would limit the creditors\u2019 ability to pursue his incoming cash. Giuliani\u2019s close friend and colleague\u00a0Maria\u00a0Ryan\u00a0last month sent a request to the bankruptcy judge to tell his creditors\u2019 law firm to \u201cstop lying in their filings to the court.\u201d She wrote that she and others who work for Giuliani are trying to keep his businesses afloat and promised to be quicker to alert his bankruptcy lawyers of new business deals. Giuliani\u2019s bankruptcy attorneys and his spokesman didn\u2019t provide additional comment to CNN for this story. Freeman and Moss on their own are taking a slightly different tactic than the broader creditors\u2019 committee, complaining to the court that Giuliani\u2019s responses to requests for information about his finances in bankruptcy court are insufficient and being done in bad faith. They want the bankruptcy judge on Wednesday to throw him out of bankruptcy court. That would allow their team of lawyers to pursue his assets directly, which would lose their current protections. \u201cCongress designed the Bankruptcy Code to ensure that bad faith debtors like Mr. Giuliani cannot successfully hop between various chapters to stay one step ahead of creditors,\u201d Moss and Freeman\u2019s lawyers wrote in a filing Monday night. Appeals of their defamation case against Giuliani currently are not allowed while his bankruptcy progresses, but he could have another shot to appeal the jury verdict if the judge grants his request for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely in a difficult position and he\u2019s still maneuvering. And he\u2019s being very shrewd in his maneuvers,\u201d Gielchinsky said. \u201cWill it result in his assets being sold? Or will it result in a change in his lifestyle? It\u2019s hard to say, because he\u2019s very hard to nail down.\u201d Spending and new deals Giuliani\u2019s sporadic disclosures over the past several months offer glimpses into his finances. For instance, in recent weeks, according to his financial records available in court, Giuliani made 40 purchases from Amazon totaling nearly $3,500. He\u2019s also bought plane tickets for himself and two business associates to fly to Palm Beach and other places. He also has pocketed thousands of dollars from participating in a documentary film this spring, where money is being sent to his limited liability company, adding to the opaqueness around his finances. His lawyers told the creditors on May 22 that a years-old documentary project, called \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d\u00a0was recently revived. Giuliani Communications received a $75,000 payment in mid-May for his ties to the project, according to a letter from his lawyers made public in court.\u00a0Paperwork from the 2021 deal around the documentary list a Russian-American, Igor Lopatonok, as the producer, and Sean Stone, a former host on the Russian-funded network RT America, as the director. Right-wing figures Chanel Rion, the One America News Network personality, and Simona Papadopoulos, the wife of a now-pardoned former Trump aide, are also involved. And his creditors believe Giuliani may be making profit from his nascent \u201cRudy\u201d-branded coffee bean. The arrangement is with a company called Burke Brands for Giuliani to promote and take an 80% cut of coffee bean sales with his face on the bags, according to his court records. Those earnings are to be paid through wire transfers to a limited liability company Giuliani has, documents of his arrangements say. The coffee deal is set to bring in to Giuliani between $4 and $12 a bag, the documents say. A business associate told the court that as of mid-June, \u00a0he had not been paid. \u201cUnfortunately, in this case, good news always seems to be accompanied with bad,\u201d lawyers for his creditors wrote to the bankruptcy judge last month. \u201cThe Debtor is structuring the business deal in a way that funnels funds that would otherwise belong to his creditors\u201d back into Giuliani\u2019s pockets. When the creditors\u2019 lawyer noticed Giuliani promoting the Rudy beans in videos on social media in mid-May, they asked his lawyers about the venture. \u201cWe saw the same thing and have requested information, and a cup of coffee,\u201d Giuliani\u2019s own bankruptcy lawyers told the creditors.

{"id": "2024_07_04_politics_biden-rising-tide-pressure-reelection-bid-analysis", "text": "No president has ever needed a public holiday like Joe Biden needs July 4. Biden is battling frantically to save his political career by escalating defiance. But he\u2019s in danger of being swamped by a rising tide against him as more Democrats express doubts that he can beat Donald Trump after a disastrous debate performance. The president will gather family members who will be critical to his future deliberations on his reelection campaign at the White House for Independence Day \u2014 in sore need of a slow news day that would allow him to regroup for potentially the most critical 48 hours of his political career. As speculation exploded Wednesday that he may be considering pulling out of the race, Biden unequivocally declared that he was in it to win. He then met 20 Democratic governors at the White House to try to prove he has the energy and acuity to win and lead for four more years. On Friday, Biden will sit for an interview with ABC News that\u2019s now shaping up as an even greater challenge than the CNN debate, given his need to put in a nimble and forceful corrective performance. Biden\u2019s swing state campaign stops will, like his every single public appearance now, be parsed for any slip-up or sign of vulnerability that supports the impression that Biden created for himself on the debate stage of a diminished commander in chief. \u201cI am running. I\u2019m the nominee of the Democratic Party. No one\u2019s pushing me out. I\u2019m not leaving,\u201d Biden declared to spooked campaign staff on a phone call on Wednesday as he searched for an elusive comeback. Now, it\u2019s jet lag that was the problem But the tough emerging reality for the president is that the assurances, shifting explanations and spin that his political aides have come up with so far are not working \u2014 because there may be no answer to his predicament. The image of an incoherent, weak and struggling president was seared on the minds of 50 million viewers a week ago. And even a far more competent damage control effort than the White House and the Biden campaign have mounted so far would have struggled to erase that impression. Attempts to explain his struggles in Atlanta are only refocusing attention on the core problem: super majorities of voters doubt he\u2019s fit enough to serve a new term that would end when he is 86. On Wednesday, for instance, the White House picked up Biden\u2019s line that he was jet lagged after two trips to Europe in early June. Given that the president had been back on US soil for over a week at the time of the debate, this only begged fresh questions over whether he\u2019s up to the onerous demands of the presidency \u2014 that frequently requires extensive travel. The idea that delayed jet lag \u2014 in combination with the cold that aides said he also had \u2014 could cause Biden to trail off in the middle of sentences and fail to make a coherent case on issues basic to his campaign did nothing to arrest his political slide. Jean-Pierre told CNN\u2019s MJ Lee Wednesday that the president had not had any kind of medical examination following the debate and since his last annual physical in February.\u00a0\u201cWe were able to talk to his doctor about that and that is a \u2018no,\u2019\u201d she said.\u00a0But on Thursday, in another qualification likely to raise questions about the credibility of the White House on this issue, the story changed.\u00a0White House spokesman Andrew Bates said\u00a0that Biden was examined by his physician in the days following the debate.\u00a0\u201cSeveral days later, the president was seen to check on his cold and was recovering well,\u201d Bates said. The latest struggles in the West Wing mean that the focus is still on Biden\u2019s disintegrating campaign rather than the grave threat to democracy and America\u2019s political freedoms that the president warns is posed by Trump. At the end of a day of stinging blows to the president, a senior administration official told CNN\u2019s Lee that the gradual erosion of his support among Democrats was like \u201cwaves crashing into the shore.\u201d The official added: \u201cFirst it\u2019s the donors. And then it\u2019s elected officials. Now it\u2019s going to be polling. It just breaks down the resistance.\u201d Things started bad for Biden on Wednesday and then got worse. \u2014 A second Democratic elected official broke cover and called for Biden step aside from his reelection campaign. Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva of Arizona told The New York Times he\u2019d back Biden if he was the nominee but that \u201cthis is an opportunity to look elsewhere.\u201d He added: \u201cWhat he needs to do is shoulder the responsibility for keeping that seat \u2014 and part of that responsibility is to get out of this race.\u201d While few other lawmakers have been so frank, there are many more who share the views of Grijalva and Texas Rep. Lloyd Doggett who spoke out on Tuesday. \u2014 A jolt of new polling had bad news for Biden. A New York Times/Siena College survey found Trump now leads by 49% to 43% among likely voters nationally, picking up a three-point swing from a week earlier before the debate. In the CNN Poll of Polls, the ex-president leads by five points (49% to 44%, in head-to-head\u00a0polls\u00a0conducted entirely after last Thursday\u2019s presidential debate). Candidates who win debates often get a blip in polling that later recedes. But Biden came into the showdown behind and needed to gain altitude. Instead, he\u2019s trending in the opposite direction after squandering his best chance to reset the race. \u2014 White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre endured yet another rough ride in the briefing room, as she came up with a new explanation of why Biden performed so badly in Atlanta, which she insisted was not an excuse. \u201cWhat I want to say is, it\u2019s the jet lag and also the cold right?\u201d she said. \u201cIt is the two things and that occurred, and you heard it in his voice when he did the debate.\u201d \u2014 Biden launched a round of calls to key Democratic power brokers, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, and his friend Delaware Sen. Chris Coons. He also recorded two radio interviews that will air Thursday in swing states Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. And Biden had the Democratic governors to the White House. Two, Minnesota\u2019s Tim Walz and Maryland\u2019s Wes Moore, offered him a boost with supportive comments to reporters. But Moore, a Democratic rising star, also said: \u201cWe always believe that when you when you love someone, you tell them the truth. And I think we came in and we were honest about the feedback that we were getting. We were honest about the concerns that we are hearing from people.\u201d \u2014 Another governor \u2014 and potential alternative nominee \u2013 Gavin Newsom of California, said in a statement to CNN that Biden was \u201call in. And so am I. Joe Biden\u2019s had our back. Now it\u2019s time to have his.\u201d There is no sign that the sentiments are not genuine. But there\u2019s also no political incentive for any Democratic Party power player eyeing the future to risk being seen to destabilize an already wounded president. Several possible alternative nominees, including Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Vice President Kamala Harris, were in Biden\u2019s meetings with the governors. \u2014 Some of the top Democrats in the House said it was time for the president to step aside, in a call with top party leadership in the chamber, CNN\u2019s Annie Grayer reported. But some members were also concerned about the frenzy that could ensue if the president went and left a power vacuum on the presidential ticket. \u2014 There were the first signs on Wednesday that the Trump campaign is calibrating how far the ex-president would need to pivot if Biden abandons his reelect. Co-campaign chairs Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles issued a statement warning that any replacement could expect a hammering for hiding \u201cthe truth from the American public\u201d about Biden\u2019s condition. \u201cEvery one of them has lied about Joe Biden\u2019s cognitive state and supported his disastrous policies over the past four years, especially Cackling Copilot Kamala Harris,\u201d they wrote. \u2014 Biden\u2019s vehement vows to stay in the race appeared to be a response to reporting in The New York Times and on CNN that the president understands the coming days are critical and could end his campaign. The White House and the campaign said the reports were false. But any sign Biden is wavering could be disastrous to on-the-ground campaigns in swing states. If Biden does get out, he\u2019ll probably be insisting he\u2019s in until the final moments. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny reported that a succession plan is taking shape that could see the president immediately throw his support, his campaign war chest and his delegates behind the vice president to head off a fight for the nomination that could split the party. \u2014 Biden\u2019s new reality was on show in the afternoon when he presided over a ceremony to posthumously award the Medal of Honor to two Civil War soldiers. The event was carried live on cable TV, in a sign that every move the president makes from now until November will be filtered through the prism of his debate failure and parsed for new signs of decaying faculties. \u2014\u00a0Another problem for Biden is that key Democratic figures who remain supportive of the president are making clear he must do more to reshape public perceptions of his capabilities and do not rule out him quitting the race. \u201cWe are going to trust him to make the right decision about the crossroads that we are at right now,\u201d Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin said on CNN. And Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell, summed up Biden\u2019s critical days ahead when she warned: \u201cHe has got a very short period of time to talk to the American people.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/politics/biden-rising-tide-pressure-reelection-bid-analysis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
{"id": "2024_07_06_politics_biden-abc-interview-analysis", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s struggle to prove he\u2019s got the strength and cognitive capacity for a second term is becoming an excruciating personal and national ordeal. Watching a visibly aged Biden answer frank questions Friday about his health on primetime television \u2013 which would normally remain between a patient and their doctor \u2013 felt like an affront to presidential dignity. It was sad to see a person who\u2019s respected and beloved by many Americans suffer such a plight. And it would be a hard heart that did not empathize with Biden as he confronts the painful human realities of aging in the most public manner imaginable. Yet Biden\u2019s position, his shocking presidential debate performance and his defiant refusal to contemplate its implications for his reelection campaign, mean he\u2019s forcing the country to have the conversation. The political tide may be turning against Biden, but the interview underscored his deep pride in a presidency that it took him nearly half a century to achieve. And he\u2019s not close to giving up his lifelong mantra to stand up and fight when he\u2019s knocked down \u2013 a factor that will exacerbate the Democratic Party\u2019s dilemma. While his interview performance was far stronger than the president\u2019s often incoherent showing at the CNN debate in Atlanta, that\u2019s not saying much. It did not contain any new disasters that would push him immediately out of the race. But it equally did little to quell the storm assailing his campaign and raised fresh intrigue about his health amid increasing signs his Democratic power base is beginning to crack. It\u2019s becoming clear that the president, his party and the country are slipping inexorably into a political crisis that raises the extraordinary possibility that a presumptive nominee could be pushed aside weeks before his party\u2019s national convention and four months before one of the most critical elections in history. The threats to Biden\u2019s prospects are quickly mounting. Two more Democratic congressman Friday called on the president to cede the nomination to a younger candidate. Virginia Sen. Mark Warner moved forward with an effort to get Senate Democrats on the same page about Biden\u2019s future and is reaching a place where he thinks it\u2019s time for Biden to suspend his campaign, a source familiar with his efforts told CNN. And House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries scheduled a virtual meeting with ranking party committee members as he faces increasing pressure from his conference over Biden\u2019s position, a Democratic lawmaker said. A test set by the campaign Biden\u2019s campaign had scheduled the interview with ABC News to try to prove that the president\u2019s stumbling debate performance last week was an aberration and to shut down growing doubts about his position as his party\u2019s 2024 nominee. He appeared more composed and fluent than at the CNN debate. He made a far more robust argument for his own successes in office and more effectively prosecuted a case against Trump than he did in the debate. And he dug in deeper despite calls by a handful of a Democratic lawmakers for him to fold his reelection bid and the growing panic among many others yet to break cover. He also dismissed concerns about his health, insisting that he was not frailer than before. \u201cCan I run the 100 (in) 10 flat? No, but I\u2019m still in good shape,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s more qualified to be president or win this race than me,\u201d Biden said in the interview conducted in swing state Wisconsin. \u201cIf the Lord Almighty came down and said, \u2018Joe, get out of the race,\u2019 I\u2019d get out of the race,\u201d Biden said, but added: \u201cThe Lord Almighty\u2019s not coming down.\u201d But Biden\u2019s admission that he felt \u201cterrible\u201d in the days before his clash with the Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump only posed new questions about his health. Those questions come at a time of growing anxiety that he\u2019s well enough at 81 to shoulder the exhausting demands of the presidency and the strain of a reelection bid. Biden compounded those doubts by seeming unsure about whether he\u2019d watched a playback of the debate \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t think so, no,\u201d he said when asked if he\u2019d watched the event \u2013 and other moments in which he trailed off in some sentences. And he added yet another explanation for his poor debate performance to add to his allies\u2019 claims he was overloaded with facts by staff, jet-lagged and suffering from a cold. The president said Trump\u2019s insistence on speaking even though his microphone was muted had put him off. Asked whether he was the same man who took office three years ago, Biden deflected by offering a litany of his achievements. \u201cIn terms of successes, yes,\u201d he said. \u201cI also was the guy who put together a peace plan for the Middle East that may be coming to fruition. I was also the guy that expanded NATO. I was also the guy that grew the economy. All the individual things that were done were ideas I had or I fulfilled. I moved on.\u201d The president was adamant that the debate was a only \u201ca bad night\u201d for which he took responsibility. But more than a week after the event, and amid rising fear among Democrats about his prospects in November and the possibility of what it will mean for democracy if Trump wins a second term, one thing is becoming increasingly clear. One bad night on such a high-profile stage before millions of viewers may be all it takes to irretrievably damage the campaign of president who will be 82 two weeks after Election Day, who large majorities of Americans worry is unfit to serve and who is asking the country to keep him in office until January 2029. Americans are worried about the next four years, not the last three Biden and his supporters warn that his painful 90 minutes on stage in Atlanta should not overshadow the achievements of his time in office. And they say that the threat posed by Trump and his autocratic instincts and vow to dedicate a second presidency to \u201cretribution\u201d far outweigh concerns over Biden\u2019s capacity. But the question that millions of Americans are asking has less to do with a review of Biden\u2019s first-term legacy and is more about whether he can function for four more grueling White House years. The interview also begged the question of whether the president is fully aware of the corrosive impact of the debate on confidence among Democrats over his chances of beating Trump. He quarreled with ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos over polling that showed him slipping further behind the former president nationally and in swing states. The interview was one of a series of events, including the Friday rally and a planned news conference at the NATO summit next week in Washington, that the campaign has held up as moments to prove Biden\u2019s fitness. But Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman of California told CNN that the president needed to do a prolonged and live television interview unlike the recorded one on ABC. Other members are demanding the president get out far more to prove his stamina, even though the campaign on Friday promised an \u201caggressive\u201d program of events in July. But that pledge did not stop the growing demands for Biden to step aside. \u201cPresident Biden has done enormous service to our country, but now is the time for him to follow in one of our founding father, George Washington\u2019s, footsteps and step aside to let new leaders rise up and run against Donald Trump,\u201d\u00a0Massachusetts Rep. Seth\u00a0Moulton\u00a0told Boston radio station WBUR in an interview that went out before the ABC interview aired. And\u00a0Illinois Rep. Mike\u00a0Quigley\u00a0said Biden\u2019s continued presence in the race has \u201calmost no hope of succeeding.\u201d \u201cI would say Mr. President, your legacy is set. We owe you the greatest debt of gratitude. The only thing you can do now to cement that for all-time and prevent utter catastrophe is to step down and let someone else do this,\u201d\u00a0Quigley told MSNBC.\u00a0He later added on CNN: \u201cWhat we need right now \u2013 and what I think takes a spine \u2013 is to step aside and recognize the president of the United States doesn\u2019t have the vigor necessary to overcome the deficit here and it\u2019s going to affect us all.\u201d Massachusetts Gov.\u00a0Maura\u00a0Healey did not go quite so far but said in a statement to CNN that Biden needed to \u201ccarefully evaluate whether he remains our best hope to defeat Trump. Whatever President Biden decides, I am committed to doing everything in my power to defeat Donald Trump.\u201d The agonizing over Biden\u2019s fate is especially painful for Democrats because many of them believe that the president has done a good job in reviving the post-Covid-19 economy, powering job growth, harnessing US allies overseas and passing big-ticket infrastructure and climate change plans. But increasingly, it seems as though the fear of a Trump term may be overwhelming satisfaction with Biden\u2019s achievements. To temper such worries, Biden used the rally to pivot from questions about his age to try to refocus attention on what he\u2019d actually done in office. \u201cI keep seeing all\u00a0those stories about I\u2019m being too\u00a0old,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me say something. I wasn\u2019t too\u00a0old\u00a0to create over 15 million new jobs. To make sure 21 million Americans are insured under the Affordable Care Act. Was I too\u00a0old\u00a0to release student debt for nearly 5 million Americans? Too\u00a0old\u00a0to put the first Black woman on the Supreme Court in the United States of America?\u201d After the debate, Biden\u2019s every word is under intense scrutiny and risks bolstering a critical narrative about his age and mental acuity after he seared an image of a struggling, president diminished by age in the mind of viewers. So, one fatalistic statement in the ABC interview about how he\u2019d feel next January if Trump won is likely to inflame concerns of many Democrats about his mindset, his understanding of his situation and what will happen in November. \u201cI\u2019ll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did the goodest job as I know I can do, that\u2019s what this is about,\u201d Biden said. The Biden campaign later contacted CNN to argue that the president had not said \u201cgoodest\u201d and ABC News changed its transcript of the interview to read \u201cI did the good as job as I know I can do.\u201d An editor\u2019s note said the transcript was \u201cupdated for clarity.\u201d The audio of the sentence is not conclusive on the question. But the situation underscored the extent to which every word the president utters following the debate is under the highest scrutiny.

Kindred\u2019s July 5 letter was only two sentences long.\u00a0He did not address the allegations in his letter. On Monday, the same day Kindred\u2019s resignation took effect, the Judicial Council of the Ninth Circuit revealed the findings of an investigation into allegations of misconduct against the judge. \u201cIn its Order and Certification, the Judicial Council concluded, among other things, that Judge Kindred engaged in misconduct by creating a hostile work environment for his law clerks and by having an inappropriately sexualized relationship with one of his law clerks both during her clerkship and after she became an Assistant United States Attorney,\u201d the Judicial Council\u2019s press release says. \u201cThe former law clerk did not appear on any case before Judge Kindred while she was employed as an Assistant United States Attorney,\u201d it adds. CNN has reached out to the US District Court for Alaska, Kindred\u2019s clerk and the White House for comment. \u2018Demonstrably egregious\u2019 According to the complaint, Kindred treated his law clerks \u201cin a demonstrably egregious and hostile manner.\u201d The report cites witness accounts and hundreds of pages of text messages detailing inappropriate and\u00a0vulgar comments Kindred made to his law clerks. Specifically, the report alleges that Kindred \u201cdiscussed his past dating life, his romantic preferences, his sex life, the law clerks\u2019 boyfriends and dating lives, his divorce, his interest in and communications with potential romantic or sexual partners, and his disparaging opinions of his colleagues.\u201d Kindred also made disparaging comments about public and political figures, the report says, citing several specific examples. \u201cIn the few instances where clerks came to Judge Kindred to discuss his inappropriate behavior, they were belittled or ostracized, and, in one instance, a clerk left the clerkship,\u201d the report adds. Rare federal judge resignation As punishment, the council requested that Kindred voluntarily resign, which he did. The council also certified the matter to the Judicial Conference of the United States to consider impeachment, according to the release. \u201cThe Judiciary is entrusted to self-govern and, in doing so, must hold its federal judges to the highest standards of integrity and impartiality. We take judicial misconduct complaints seriously,\u201d Chief Circuit Judge Mary H. Murguia, who appointed the special committee that investigated Kindred, said in a statement. \u201cWhen allegations arise, the Judiciary conducts a fair and thorough investigation that focuses on promoting a civil and respectful workplace, free of discrimination and harassment, and maintaining the integrity of the Judiciary,\u201d she said. Kindred\u2019s sudden resignation from judicial service is unusual. Federal judges are appointed for life. Of the 27 vacancies listed on the federal judiciary\u2019 website, Kindred\u2019s is the only opening to come as the result of a resignation \u2014 as all\u00a0the other judges were either elevated, retired or are assuming senior status.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/politics/joshua-kindred-resignation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}

{"id": "2024_06_20_politics_colin-allred-border-texas-senate-race", "text": "Democratic Rep. Colin Allred of Texas, who\u2019s challenging GOP Sen. Ted Cruz in the Republican-leaning state this fall, is promising to \u201cfix the border\u201d in a new ad, declaring that he \u201cstood up to Joe Biden on the border.\u201d But just two years ago, the congressman dismissed the issue as one playing out in the \u201cright-wing echo chamber,\u201d despite a sharp increase of migrants at the US-Mexico border at the time. Allred, a former NFL player and civil rights attorney who represents the northeast Dallas area, made his comments in February 2022 as the US was seeing a surge in migrants at the border compared with during the Trump administration \u2013 and even compared with the previous year under Biden, which smashed past records of encounters at the border. Asked about Republicans running on the border \u2013 along with crime, inflation and \u201cwokeism\u201d in the 2022 midterms \u2013 Allred said he thought most voters were focused on inflation and the economy. \u201cI think some of those others may fall into, kind of, the right-wing echo chamber,\u201d Allred told CBS News\u2019 Major Garrett on \u201cThe Takeout\u201d podcast. \u201cI don\u2019t hear a lot about the border here in Dallas, and I\u2019m in a border state. Obviously, we want to have comprehensive immigration reform. We want to try and, you know, address some of these things,\u201d Allred said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not \u2013 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a top-of-mind issue,\u201d he added, going on to say that he believed voters were still frustrated about Covid-19. In February 2022, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded 166,010 encounters with migrants at the US-Mexico border, reflecting a significant increase from the 101,099 encounters in the same month the previous year \u2013 a rise of 64%. That surge was part of a larger trend in 2022, which saw a then-record 2.4 million migrant encounters \u2013 a huge increase compared with during the Trump administration, which saw its highest annual total enforcement actions in fiscal year 2019 with 1.15 million. By comparison, fiscal year 2021, which covered part of Biden\u2019s first year in office, saw 1.95 million total enforcement actions. Though Allred dismissed the political importance of the border at the time, a University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll from June 2021 found that 34% of Texas voters identified immigration and border security, combined, as the biggest concerns for the state (each at 17%) \u2013 ahead of Covid at just 5%. Today, border issues are an even greater concern for Texas voters. A University of Texas/Texas Politics Project poll in April found a significant majority of Texas voters described migrants crossing the US-Mexico border as a crisis (48%) or a very serious problem but not a crisis (23%). In his race to unseat Cruz, Allred is now spending at least $380,000 running an online ad exclusively dedicated to the border issue. Allred did not publicly announce the ad, as he has done for previous ads. \u201cI\u2019m Colin Allred. Fentanyl is flooding into our country. Our border is broken, and so are our politics. To fix it, we have to go after the cartels and fix the border,\u201d Allred says in the ad. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to do it in a way that upholds our values. Values passed down from my grandfather \u2013 a customs officer in Brownsville. I stood up to Joe Biden on the border and to extremists like Ted Cruz, who prefer chaos to real solutions. I\u2019m Colin Allred. I\u2019m running for Senate to fix this problem.\u201d The ad is running online, where Google ad transparency data shows that Allred has spent at least $280,000 promoting two versions of the spot that run 30 and 15 seconds \u2013 and have been shown more than 11 million times. On Facebook, Allred has spent more than $100,000 running the ad. In a statement to CNN, Allred campaign spokesperson Josh Stewart said: \u201cSince his first days in Congress, Congressman Allred has focused on bipartisan solutions to fix our broken immigration system and secure our border. During his 12 years in the Senate, Ted Cruz has shown that he only wants to play politics with the crisis at the border and that he will never be part of a bipartisan solution.\u201d A shift on the border Allred \u2013 who was first elected to Congress in 2018 by flipping a GOP-held seat in the Dallas suburbs \u2013 has sought to toughen many of his stances on the border and immigration enforcement ahead of the statewide election in November. He joined a Democratic-led border security task force this spring and said he supported the border security bill introduced earlier this year that was killed by\u00a0Republicans. That bill did not contain provisions for any undocumented immigrants, including a pathway to citizenship, which Allred has long pushed for, but he called it \u201ca much-needed step\u201d on immigration reform. Allred has also shifted his rhetoric on a border wall popularized by Trump. At a January 2018 town hall, when he was running to unseat GOP Rep. Pete Sessions, Allred pledged to personally tear down the wall if it was enacted instead of creating a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented. \u201cThis idea that we\u2019re going to trade this for a racist wall. Absolutely not. If they build that wall, I will be there tearing it down,\u201d he said. He would repeatedly refer to the border wall as \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cwasteful, ineffective\u201d and a \u201cfailed policy\u201d that was not needed over the next few years, though he said in 2019 that physical barriers were \u201csometimes appropriate.\u201d Years later, in October 2023, after the Biden administration announced construction of new sections of the wall at the US-Mexico border, using funds already allocated during the Trump administration, Allred praised the decision. \u201cThis is a necessary step to help Texas\u2019 overwhelmed border communities deal with this current surge of migrants,\u201d he told The Hill, adding that it was \u201conly a partial solution.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/politics/colin-allred-border-texas-senate-race/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "politics"}}
